20090219170853AARb2li	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	If a Woman has toxemia and she is 35 1/2 weeks pregnant can a doctor legally refuse to induce her?	Ok this one may be a little complicated. My mother has been pregnant now with twins for 35 1/2 weeks, and shes been having a lot of symptoms of toxemia. Her doctor the whole time has told her it is normal and hasn't tried to look in to it, and in fact usually isn't there when she goes in for a check up. The whole time nurses and other people who have medical backgrounds have told her something else is wrong but the doctor says everything is normal. My mother has begged him to take him to induce her but he won't he says" I'm not going to play god", because he is afraid that the babies lungs may be under developed. So my mother asked to be put on steroids to quicken their lung development but once again he refuses stating "I'm not going to play god". So today she goes for her check up and the doctor isn't there because he is doing emergency labor with another patient. Well now we find out she has toxemia like we have thought the whole time. Can her doctor still refuse to induce her considering it is endangering her health and the babies' health? Or could we go to the hospital to possibly get her to be an inpatient and then use the Patient Self-Determination Act to force them to take the babies? Any Ideas?
20090219170947AA88YzR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Am I being selfish for not wanting to take my daughter to school?	Long story short....      Married a year and running into issues. I'm a step father and still building a relationship with my daughter who I love tremendously. His school is 45 minutes away (kindegarten fyi) which was convenient when my wife worked out that way. She got a new job 45 minutes away from the school and now it's a strain on the relationship having to go out that way to pick her up. She doesn't want her to attend a local school, because it doesn't meet her "standards" for a good school.       I'm like wft! Its kindergarten and were both frustrated about dropping off and picking her up as we both work during the day. It sucks. I want to help, but I did not agree to this school in the 1st place, and now she wants me to wake up 2 hours earlier and take her to school to help out and get myself to work during the week, and stay sane.       I don't feel this is fair or makes any sense, and feel my wife is being very irrational. This has been a pattern developing lately...daughter first...husband falls somewhere after. She stated, "I'm not being a good father or meeting her expectations for her daughter"      Am I selfish? What yall think?

I've managed easily for the past 6 months to hide my tummy, but now it's getting clear that I am in fact pregnant.

20090219172937AAOlE7p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Question about being induced?	This is my first pregnancy, and because I live in Florida and my mom lives in Michigan, she's pretty much missing the entire pregnancy. I really want her to be here in June when I give birth and she's already said she will make the arrangements to take time off work and all, but because babies are so unpredictable I feel the situation is likely going to be me going into labor, calling her to take the next flight out.      My aunt suggested I talk to the doctor about being induced, that way I have a set day and my mom can make arrangements to be here a few days before and after. My question is, when is the time to discuss this with the doctor? Do they induce you right at 40 weeks, earlier, later? If you've been induced, what was it like, would you recommend it?      I've still got quite awhile to deal with everything, but this pregnancy seems to be speeding by and I feel like June will be here before I know it! Thanks for any advice! :)

She has been going since she was 7 months old but in the past week has started to cling to me and scream when i leave, it breaks my heart and i'm constantly walking out in tears. I thought most children went through separation anxiety around the 12 month mark. Could it be this now or do you think something may have happened to make her behave this way???? She has just gone up a room level but is still with all the same children she has been with from the start, the only difference is they nap on mats not in cots and they are in a different room.......

20090219173608AAFbLzk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you think about step-parents?	Do you think a "step-mom" is a "mom" or a "step-dad" is a "dad"?      Do you think step-parents should act just as parents, or should they take a backseat to the biological mom and dad in terms of rearing children?      Do you think it depends on how the family is set up? For example, if the child has a mother AND father that are both good parents and actively involved in the childs life, then should a step-parent have as much authority?      I personally grew up with a mom and a dad, and then got a step-mom when I was 13 because my dad remarried. I love (and has always loved) my stepmom but she didn't really act much like my mom. She didn't do a lot of disiplining or rule making unless my dad wasn't there or something... she was an active part of my life, but not the same as a parent. I have never viewed her as a mom.. more of a "big sister" sort of.. I still have a lot of respect for her (espechally now that I'm an adult).      Do you think most situations are like mine?

At first I took my pills at the same time every day. And we always used condoms. As time when on we stopped using condoms. And I didn't always take my pill on time....& skipped days. Also he wasn't always pulling out.  So far no babies.      We worry that there is something wrong when it comes to us being able to have kids. Now yes we haven't been "trying" but we haven't been "safe" either. We both want to be parents some day when the time comes. But don't want to find out our time has passed. As of now we have both agreed that we would not do drugs/shots or anything with our eggs and/or sperm in a dish. Adoption is out as of now. I understand we are both young (I'm 21 & he's 23) but you can never think about this to early.        I'm very worried because when my mom was 29 when she found out she couldn't have kids any more kids. Her and my father wanted 4+ but things didn't work out like that. I have already had paps test that have abnormal cells just like my mom had.  Everything has come back normal later but its still a worry.       HELP!

And not to play the devil's advocate or anything here, but...if breast milk is the perfect food, why do we need to give our babies vitamins?
20090203105614AAXTvsV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does it sound like im.....?!?!?!?	I have an irregular period and the last time i had one started on december 2, 2008 and ended on december 6, 2008. Me and my ex-boyfriend had sex numerous times during that time but he "said" he never came in me even though i believed he was lying. The last time me and him had sex was january 19, 2009 and this time he admitted that he came in me. On january 30 and 31 i began to spot even though at first i though i was on my period but it wasn't. Also on the 30 i slept for like 13 hours and on the 31 i slept for almost 12. I took a hpt on the 31 but i think it was to early to tell. The test of course came out negative. I've been having cramps in my stomach and lower back, headaches, constipation, and the veins in my breasts are a little more prominent. I know i need to take another test but does this sound like im pregnant? Also I know that pre-*** contains sperm. P.S. Don't give me an answer talking bout take a test because i am going to take another one. Also don't tell me to go research because I already have I am simply just asking for opinions and third, if you think it is stupid question then simply don't answer it.  But for those who do thank you for your opinion
20090203112636AA45Eg7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Am I being selfish (parenting)?	My boyfriend and I talk about marriage and the future. I have a 6 year old from a previous relationship. I've told him that I don't want any more kids (I wasn't a kid person in the first place). He says that he wants to carry on his last name.      I have since changed my mind and realized that once we are married, I would love to have a child with him. The  problem is that he wants a boy. Period. If we have a child and the baby turns out to be a girl - he wants to try AGAIN!      There is no part of me that likes the idea of having THREE kids. I know that I couldn't handle it (I adore parents of more than 2 children!). He says that it is unfair b/c he won't be able to carry on his name if he doesn't have a boy.      (He is the only son of his father, and his father is the only boy of the siblings....so he is the last boy from the immediate family with their last name.)      Am I being selfish for not wanting more than 2 children?   If we do not have a boy is it really the end of the world?

20090203110128AAcEyx5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	5month old son throwing up today?	my son is 5months old and has been on solids (1jar at night, veggie) for 1month now.  And he did great.  We started him on another jar during the day as well (fruits) for about 2 weeks now and he has done wonderful.  No problems.  For the last 2days though he has been extremely cranky (i think it could be teething), he has been nawing on EVERYTHING and throwing fits, droolin all over the place.  He doesn't have a temperature or anything.  He seemed a bit constipated this morning, so I gave him prunes and we fixed that problem up it seems, lol.  That was about 8am this morning.  About 12:00noon he started spitting up a bit, and then it was like a little more and a little more.  He got really cranky again.  He still has no fever, and I just layed him down and he went to sleep.  Could this still be signs of teething?  or maybe still constipated a bit?  or a tummy ache?  He's done GREAT on jar foods with no problems at all.  I did try to give him a bit of cereal in the morning instead of his jar food a couple days ago, and thats about when all of this started...Could it be an issue with the cereal?

20090219174854AADCsMF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Question for divorced/single mothers?	My husband and I have been together for 7 years. He has a 13 year old daughter from a previous marriage. We have 2 children together ages 2 and 4 months. I am asking this question for divorced/single mothers because I would like to see things from her point of view.  Okay....   My husbands ex is extremely rude and disrespectful to me and always has been. There is never a time when we are together that she doesn't seize the opportunity to take a shot at me or my marriage. I am always polite to her and just brush it off although I am boiling. She constantly makes remarks about wanting to get back together with my husband or how it was when they were married. She argues constantly and will call us just to start an argument. She puts their daughter up to calling for extra money (she gets child support) We can hear her in the background feeding my stepdaughter. My stepdaughter hates it and gets really upset. I try to include his ex in a lot of activities that we do with my stepdaughter so she feels like her parents can be together, I am always polite to his ex, I spend as much time with my stepdaughter as I can. I know that my husband needs his relationship with his daughter but his ex-wife's behavior is inappropriate and now my son is getting to the age where he is aware and she isn't a good influence for him. I don't know what else I can do to make our situation any better with his ex. If you have any advice I would greatly appreciate it. I am sympathetic to her because I can't imagine how hard it is to be a single mom but my sympathy is dwindling.

20090219174506AAjxrJk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Question regarding the amount of Infant Tylenol I have been giving my Daughter?	Heres the details:      When my Daughter was around 11 months old she developed Roseola and had a fever. The Nurse at the Hospital we took her too said to give her 2 droppers of Tylenol. (1.6) At that time she weighed about 22 lbs-       Assuming she could still have 2 droppers of Tylenol (1.6) at 15 months I called the Nurse Hotline tonight just too make sure that she could still have that amount and no more...AND to find out the nurse says: She can have 1 dropper full, then a half dropper full!!!!! So the whole time I had been giving my Daughter 2 dropper fulls is apparently not what I should have been giving her. BUT, the Nurse at the hospital said that was the correct amount!      Has anyone else ever been given this information about giving your baby 2 dropper fulls at 11 months...Could this have harmed her? Im scared now! I plan to call her Ped in the morning, but until then, just wondering if this could have harmed her. Please! Serious answers only!!!!!

I use to produce about 6 ounces every couple of hours and i would pump about 4 to 5 times a day and now i am only producing about 2 to 4 ounces about once or twice a day if i can pump. And at times I can only pump a little bit like an ounce at times. Can someone please tell me what is going on and if there is something wrong with me or it is just normal??

20090203111807AA2qFhd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How do I word it to my hubby about my s/i/l vs. the delivery room?	Ok, so on Super Bowl Sun., my in-laws came over to watch the game w/ us. Not a problem, I love my in-laws VERY much and have been blessed to have a great relationship w/ them. As I was talking to my s/i/l, she kinda gave me the impression that she wanted to be in the delivery room. (I'm due w/ baby # 3 in 11 wks.) I have NO problem w/ her being in there leading up to the actual delivery, but when I'm ready to push, I just want my husband in there w/ me. It's a special moment that's meant for only us. Ya know? I didn't want to make a big deal of it during the game b/c I have a tendency of coming across as b*tchy (thanks hormones!), so I dropped hints and told her the story of my last delivery. (Hubby's godfather stayed in there, then left b/c he can't handle all that nastiness and I mentioned that it was better that way b/c it's special moment for my hubby & I to share alone.)       Basically, I want to ask my husband if he got that same impression (that his sister wants to be in there for the actual birth), but need help in wording it just right so I don't a) come across as b*tchy and b) offend him. He's 1 of those that'll do whatever I want, so I know he'd kick her out w/ no problem and not care how she felt about it. LOL Any suggestions as to how I can word it just right?       Also, have any of you ever experienced an anxious feeling during pregnancy? I get major butterflies (never had this prob w/ my other 2) and I'm not sure if the baby's hitting something that's giving me this feeling or if it's a feeling that something's wrong. It's weird.

I babysit for a little boy who is 18, almost 19 months old. his mother and i are good friends. he walks, runs and climbs just fine. but he does not say anything. he makes plenty of noises, babbles and such, but not a single word. he has said mama at home, and sometimes he says it at my house, but that's it. his parents asked me my opinion if it seemed like he was a little behind and i just skated the question - i said i thought boys sometimes took a little longer than girls (i have 2 daughters) and that they should ask their dr.    i'm wondering if he actually might have a problem .... he was a difficult baby, very fussy, and even now he sometimes cries for 20-30 minutes for no apparent reason. i try everything to calm him down and eventually something works. but i'm looking back now in my daughter's baby books and my youngest was saying all kinds of words at 17 months. i wrote that she could say, "ut oh, i got it, i did it, here you go, thanks, mama, dada, yay, hi, all gone, apple, i love you too, tada, cheese, cup, ow, a baby, a ball, and a hat."   does it sound like this little boy has some kind of problem? i dont think it's with his hearing because he turns his head when i call out his name. but when i ask him "do you want to go outside?" or "do you want some milk?" i just get a blank stare.   what do you think?

But we were watching a movie (The man in the moon), and a boy was trying to kiss a girl and she said to take her home.

20090219183843AAppmer	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is it normal for kids to act like this after a spanking?	My daughter got a spanking yesterday afternoon from her father. She is seven years old and told several lies. She had also lost her Nintendo Ds earlier in the week for lying and she went into our room and got it.    When my husband got  home form work he gave her a a spanking. We told her if she tried to get it out of our room she would get a spanking. She did not take us seriously.    She is doing better today, but she pouted all night last night. Me being a softy mom, can not stand it when my child does not tell me good night. She was so mad at me. I know she hates getting spankings from her father. She made me feel guilty. She gave me a look as if 'how could let daddy spank me?"    Now my husband did not abuse her, he gave her about five firm swats on the bottom. I am sure it did not feel good, but that is kind of the point. Do your kids pout after being punished?

My relationship with my 2 year old daughter is very awkward, especially since I got pregnant.  During my pregnancy I have had very bad depression, and I am sooo moody.  I felt so horrible about the way she is towards me, I would just say whatever and let her be the way she is.  But now its like, she only wants her dad, or his parents.  Shes ALWAYS asking for him to do stuff, I feel like an idiot because my bf(her dad) always has to TELL her to give me a kiss and say I love you, if I ask her for one she will cover her face, very rarely will she give me a kiss.  IF she hurts herself, she won't let me comfort her, she says daddy daddy.  At night he has to put her to sleep or she'll cry if I do it.  Sure, everything is totally fine when its just me and her, but I think i feel like she feels like she HAS to be nice to me cuz im the only one there for her at the time, but now shes starting to cry for her dad when hes gone, she won't let me console her.. the past 3 months I just started feeling like giving up and focusing on the baby thats coming,  I know I probably brought all this on to myself, but can I fix it?  Could I have ruined my chance of being a good mom to her?  I don't know what I did wrong and if I can even change it.  someone please help...

20090219181251AAtM3D8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Lighter period? What could this be?	Hi, so my girlfriend has been having a lighter period for the last 2 months. We are sexually active and we always use protection. I wear a condom, that has never broke, and she has been on birth control for the past 2 years. Her last two "periods" have been lighter than normal. Her first one was a little less than her normal amount and this time its a level above spotting she said so far on the first day. I figure that since she is bleeding during the week she is supposed to (during her brown pills, on the same day she always begins her period) that she isn't pregnant. What do you think?

I had sex with my boyfriend last weekend and we kinda sorta got caught up in the moment and didn't use a condom. Well, i'm on birth control and i've been on it for a while now, but for the longest time i didn't take it correctly and was always missing pills or taking them really late. But for alittle over a month i've been pretty good and only missed a couple pills. Well a few days prior to us having unprotected sex, I was late taking my pill by a few hours (My doctor said the effectiveness will decrease even if it's only a few hours late of taking it) and then a couple days later i missed it by a whole day! Plus, to top it all off i was in the time frame of most fertile(12-14 days after begining of last period)    Yeah. I'm just wondering what's the chance i could be pregnant.........??? I don't think i am, but then again i don't want to even think about it being a possibility. I'm just worried and need some opinions. So could i be?

20090219185653AA97wCX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Any other women experience a molar pregnancy?	I found out that I was pregnant about a week ago. I went in today for my first check up. My blood work was great and the doctor said that I was 6 weeks and 4 days along. I begged to have an ultrasound, just because I had a miscarriage 4 months ago. He finally gave in and sent me for an ultrasound, and they told me that I was having a molar pregnancy and set me up for surgery to remove the placenta and embryo tomorrow morning. I had two doctors look at the ultrasound and they both confirmed that it was a molar pregnancy, which means that it's not going to be a viable pregnancy. I'm just totally lost on this whole thing,and very emotional. We have been trying to have a baby for about a year. We had a miscarriage at 5 weeks along in October and now this. I am just totally freaked out.      The most important thing is that I don't feel like anything is wrong. I have all the right pregnancy symptoms. Nausea, tender breasts, minor backache, fatigue. This is just so hard because we really want a child. I know that I can produce because I have a perfectly healthy little girl. My pregnancy with her was perfect. Are there any other women who know what I'm going through, and do you have any advice???      Thanks!

We have been kinda relaxed with potty training because she has a ureter birth defect which makes her feelings different then a normal kid. Here is the problem:      Our kids are a little less then 16 months apart. I work 2 jobs so I'm not home a ton so it is up to my wife, but she is tired and has all she can do to run after everyone all day long. And the weekend is when I'm home, but that is when we get all of our errands done so it is pretty filled. (My wife has no driver's license due to a medical reason) So even though our daughter would have issues in general with potty training, we feel like we have no time or energy to do it. I don't know what to do and neither does my wife. It's going to take longer then average to potty train her cause of her issues but we are literally never at a stand still, but she needs to get it done one day.      Oh, and 1 more issue: My daughter is scared of public bathrooms, every time she goes into one, she flips out and screams bloody murder like she is dying, she has done this since about a year old. How do i fix that cause I am aware that she is going to have to go in public someday...      I'm lost.

I feel so awful, the guys so cute and he now has to get up and go to work every day. As a teenager, how do you feel about the economic crisis and/or Obama's stimulus plan? thanks :]

20090220225736AAVcyie	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Why is she acting funny? mothers plz help?	My friend just had a baby and has no problem TELLING me i am going to watch her baby while she does whatever  she wants like an extra shower with her man. If her and her man want to go out i have no problem staying home. anyways, I am always left home with the baby and rarely go anywhere. In the rare occasion i do go out with her, she wont let me interact with the baby at all. i can't feed, hold, touch, or talk to the baby. the excuse is "i can't let him go for more than a second" but that's only if people are around. if we are alone it's fine but if someone rolls around the corner best believe she is reaching and making a comment having to do with there you are i have been looking for you like i tried to kidnap her son. another example is her son grabbed my finger and held it. she then pulled my hand back as she undid his grip. i think she has a fear people will think he is my baby. what i don't understand is why it's like that when the only place i go, she has been with her son a million  times and everybody knows he is hers. I don't even try to act like he is mine. I guess what i am wondering is why am i doing everything she should be doing at home but only when we are out is she interested in appearing to be the best mom in the world when truly she can care less when no one is looking?
20090220222451AAkFwbI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	7 wks pregnant and continuous spotting?	I am 7 wks pregnant tomorrow. Since I found out that I was pregnant, (about three weeks ago) I have been spotting on and off. It ranges from light pink to brown to a brick reddish-brown color and it is not heavy at all. At most, only enough to hardly fill a pantyliner. I made my 1st Ultrasound appt but the doc won't see me till next Friday. I talked to the nurse about spotting when I first found out that I was preggers and she said it was okay as long as it doesn't turn out heavy or bright red with cramps. Well I have been spotting now on and off for like two weeks now and it is really freaking me out especially with hearing about stories with people miscarrying and having to have a D&C.    Do I have anything to worry about? I am stressed out about this!

I don't usually have any spotting that far in advance so I just don't really know what to think of it.    Thanks in advance!

My daughter has been sick for a little while now and for the last few days been taking prescribed medication to counter the beginning of bronchitis. She is certainly getting better, feeling better, happier in general, however, this morning it seems like she has some congestion in her chest that could be easily solved if she were just to cough and spit out that last bit of phlegm in there. I would be interested in hearing people's experience in this and how long it continued. There must be some way for this to come out. The child doesn't sound sick any longer, just that last bit of 'nasty guck' still stuck in her throat.

I've been breastfeeding my daughter for over 7 weeks now since birth and I noticed today that one of my nipples is extremely sore when my daughter feeds on it and continues to hurt after she's done nursing. I checked my daughter for thrush and found no signs. My breast with the sore nipple is not engorged or sore itself just strictly the nipple. I have a shooting pain in my breast starting from my nipple and the pain continues upwards in my breast. Will this go away overnight or is it a possible infection?    As a little tidbit the nipple is not as sore when I pump that breast compared to my daughter latching on and nursing.

20090220175337AAfOqm1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How do I continue my milk supply with my preemie?	My daughter was born at 29 Weeks 6 days. I didn't start nursing her till about 33 Weeks. She went home a month earlier then expected because she did so well! So that was all well and good until my milk production started to dwindle. She left the hospital taking in 2 oz which was supplemented with a preemie formula at a 2:1 ration. 2 parts breast milk and 1 part formula. This was to help her to gain weight for t he next 4-6 weeks.    She is now 3 months old, almost 4 and takes in about 4 oz. I have been supplementing with formula which she mostly takes in, because my milk doesn't seem to be thriving. I even got off the pill after I had already been taking it a month, because a lactation consultant suggested trying that. So far I haven't seen any real results and it has been a month since that change.    I have been continuing to nurse her at least every 3-4 hrs. I pump twice a day. After I nurse her I supplement with formula.    Is it too late, at 3 months old to try and get her to just strictly nurse or will I be harming her health wise if she is not getting enough milk from me? How do I go about that? After she nurses do I just let her go until the next feeding? I am really determined to continue to nurse her...and I will as long as she wants. I just hope I have not jeopardized that opportunity because I have supplemented with formula.

Their children do a lot of unsafe stuff (like climb on tables, chairs, highchairs, anything really) and one child has already lost a tooth because she fell off a coffee table. I sound like a broken record around these kids because I am constantly running around saying "be careful" and "get down from there!!" while my sisters sit and drink coffee.

He has been into and out of trouble with the law the last year or so.  Will not listen to anything anyone tells him and usually responds with a smart remark.  I have been pretty good about letting him do what he wants and do things his way until I seen his report card.  You have to try to get grades this low.  When I confronted him about it, smarted off to me made comments about my injury and our parents.  It was all I could do to restrain myself from beating some respect into him.      I never had any problems with authority as a child, A & B student, yes sir, no sir and joined the military right after high school.  I am not sure how to deal with this anyone have an suggestions?

She is going to be 18 and since we really didn't do anything special for her sweet 16 my mom and I are planning a surprise party for her. So the plan is to take her out to dinner to a nice restaurant for a "small family dinner" and then the next day she can do whatever she wants. That is what we are telling her so she doesn't feel bad. But instead her three best friends will be sitting at the table at the fancy restaurant. Then me, my mom, her, and my step dad will all go into the restaurant, and the waiter will sit us at the same table as her friends. (Parents will be at a different table of course.) That will be the first little surprise. Then after dinner instead of going home we are going to spend the night at a nice hotel down in Waikiki by the beach. (We live in Hawaii). She and her friends will have their own suit. The next day we can go to the spa, shop around, or go to the beach or pool. My mom was also thinking about getting her a Visa Debit Gift Card with a 'good amount of money' on it so she can have it to spend on whatever she wants. So do you think she will be happy? It's a total surprise because she thinks she is just going out to dinner with the fambam and then like hanging out with friends the next day.

20090221003317AAJDd3k	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	When you love your babys father but he doesnt love you anymore....?	Like is it possible to love someone and hate them at the same time? I mean I love my sons father. But he hurt me really bad, he moved in with another woman while I was pregnant, he played so many mind games with me. He has been tellin me he loves me and wants me back but it will be a while before he moves out of his girlfriends house. So I asked him last night who is heart really belonged to and he told me he couldnt answer that. Obviously it doesnt really belong to me, it belongs to her. Our son is 2 months old now and he took our son for the first time last night cuz I had to work and he was gonna babysit, and soon as we parted ways he bacame a complete d*ck to me and wouldnt even tell me how he was doing when I asked. Like I am so tired of his games and being hurt, but I love him, and not only becuz he is my sons father, there are other reasons too. But I told him today that I was done, that he needed to stay with his other family (she has 2 kids that arent his, but none by him). I'm just so hurt. What do I do? I am really almost to that point where I litterally get sick to my stomach when I even think about him or see him. I have to deal with him for the next 18 years, but I almost want to hate him. How do I deal with this?

Like everyone says that when you love someone and he (or she) broke your heart, it takes time to get over them. RIght? But how can you get over someone if you have a child with them and have to deal with them on a regular basis for the next 18 years?

20090221013452AAbHArY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy update!! Includes a few questions!!?	hi   still in hospital and my contractions are now 15minutes apart and last for about 3-4minutes still. my babies are just about 3/5 engaged and i am in quite alot of pain. my doctor recons that my babies will come in the next couple of days (eekk!). my mum and dad have finally come around and they have asked me if there are any last minute things that need doing. i was thinking, would the twins like there cots next to each other or away from each other?. i really want them to come out as i am extremely uncomfortable but i also want them to stay in there aswell so they can develop  more. here is a picture of my bump    http://s642.photobucket.com/albums/uu144...

I am now 10 days late and I have already gotten a negative test result. But that isn't the question.    At work I am required to get a yearly TB test, and I just got one. If I'm pregnant would that hurt the baby? I thought that I heard somewhere that it wouldn't but i'm not sure.
20090221005017AATtpVz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I'd like some opinions on me.?	-I'm confused about my sexuality, although I'm pretty sure I could be a lesbian.   -I believe every woman should have the right to an abortion if she chooses it.    -I think the octomom is nobody else's business but her own, and people need to stop trashing her and highlighting her in the media.   -I have straight As, but never tried until highschool.   -I think spanking is wrong, although older kids who are too dumb to know right from wrong should be hit.   -I do not and could never believe in any form of God.   -Love has no race.   -Most of my clothing is either from wet seal or hot topic, and I prefer thongs to granny panties.   -I've made out with friends boyfriends behind their back.   -I've never shoplifted.   -I'm a virgin, but nobody believes me =P   -I don't listen to anyone who tells me to do something I don't want to do.   -I demand respect before I provide for anyone.   -I can ignore peer pressure, and people envy me for it.   -After nearly 15 years of living with my parents, they've learned no matter what they say, I'll live however I want anyways   -My friends won't talk back to me, because they know I'll always win no matter what it is.   -I have no idea what I want to do with my life.   -I only date guys for the hell of it, because I feel sorry for them, or because I know I could easily order them around and make them my *****.      So, I wanna know what you guys think of me =)

They throw themselves on floor and won't get up.    They constantly throw tantrums or even hit you when you punish them.    They ignore you when you ask a question.    They are rude to other adults and even to other children.    They refuse to share toys or treats with other children.    They are show-offs and are constantly trying to one-up their peers to be the center of attention.    They always want whatever everyone else has. Once they have it, they want something new.    They keep a messy room and never help out around the house despite your pleas for them to do so.    They refuse to go to bed.       *** BE HONEST NOW ***

Anyways, I left and didn't call her or anything for a month and now she won't take me back. I'm not sure why because she was the one who through a chair at my head. She should have been thrilled to see me and be at my every waking call. She is lucky to have such a great man and should treat me like a king. This is what happens when you educate women.

Now i don't like guys my age only older and i feel more secure with a older guy is like i don't need to impress them as much as i do with a younger guy which i feel so overwhelmed. i was talking to this 30 year old man and i really liked him but everytime he would drink he would lash out on me and swear at me and somehow i would take it and if it was my sister she would end it there but i kept it going i even feel if i let this man hit me i would still went back and kept talking to him if he begged long enough..But he stopped talking to me because he says im immature so he stopped talking to me on the phone and kept it professional at work.      so will i be a abused women in the future in the making or what...How can i change this how can i get better..please help me

My baby is missing his bottle terribly at night and keeps waking up and it's really difficult to stop him crying. He wakes up about 8 times per night and sometimes can cry for half an hour.   Due to a tooth fracture he cannot drink from a bottle anymore,so he is forced to give up his bottle which he really loved :(   What can I do? His tooth broke a bit over a week ago.I hope this won't last forever?    His bottle is available all day,but he won't drink from it. Also not from a sippy cup. I'm feeding him from a normal cup/spoon now.   He is older than 1 1/2 so he can eat anything. And I do know he doesn't need a bottle at this age.

He said he felt something like a glob of mucus like stuff come out with him and I saw it too. It almost looked like sperm. This might seem like a stupid question, but could that have come out from me when he pulled out? Because we checked the condom to see if there were any tears but we couldn't find any and the sperm in the condom seemed to be all there. Please help! I'm a little concerned about pregnancy.

20090220233211AAIuvol	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Not sure what's going on, here--preggers? Uti?	So, here's my story. The last time I had intercourse was about 55/60 days ago. I am on birth control, my partner used a condom. Afterwards the condom was checked--no breaks. There was no issue with it (the condom) during sex. A week after, I got my period--regular time, regular way. About four weeks later I had a morning where I was very ill, and vomited. I went to the doctor, who found I had a severe nasal infection and drainage. The vomiting lasted one more day, then the meds kicked in, and I've been fine since. Since that time, I had my regular period again--same as always. No symptoms. Still, due to paranoia, I took a ton of pregnancy tests--about six, all in the morning, all following directions, all in different weeks. Each was negative. However, in the last week or so I've had a stabbing pain in my right breast and on the right side of my pelvis. I have also had a burning pressure in my pelvis, and the need to urinate often. However, when I do, there isn't much pee, and it is mildly painful. Afterwards the pain remains for about ten minutes, then fades until the next incident. I have a little discharge, but it's nothing like a yeast infection (which I have had in the past). I also have been having a serious gas issue in the evening, around the time the need for urination is at it's worst. My big question is this: could I be pregant? Are these signs or pregancy, or of another issue? I've tried to look online, but everyone has horror stories and conflicting answers. Please help--I'm very worried.I know pregnancy seems unlikely, but...

One in 2004 and one in 2007 ever since the first one I have been having trouble. I seen a doctor and they were going to send me to get some tests done but my insurance was canceled so I was unable to go. I hadn't had any trouble with it for awhile. But now its like every week I can't figure out what it is. I have had plenty of bladder infections so I dont think its that..they go away for awhile and then come back. When it happens I can pee perfectly fine without pain and then when I get up I have the urge to still pee and actually have to wear a pad just so i can get it all out without being on the potty all day. I am wondering whats causing it when i dont have bladder infection. I have looked up renal failure and that just made me worry more. I am thinking that since I have had 2 csections that it could be causing something.someone please help...i just want to get some kind of an idea of what I could have before going to the doctor when I get my insurance back...thanks         pressure usually makes it go away faster
20090220235720AANDC8s	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 17month old? Worried :o(?	Hi All -   I'm a little worried about my 17month old.    He's just starting to get into the "temper tantrum" phase, Nothing bad. Pretty much what I expected out of him, A little normal Head Butting when upset, Overly Testing us, it comes and goes. Usually depends on how tired he is, how he was put to bed "if he was whining then its worse",. and he wakes up " bad if he wakes up crying". I've noticed he Doesn't Cry as much at all, & Even though he still wakes up like 4-5times per night It's ok, I'm just waiting for HIM to decide when he wants to sleep through the night. He's also developed very normally, His speech isn't the best "I think because I'm a stay at home mom" so he's not around as many people as he would be in day care, but I'm not concerned with it. He shows Understanding it what we are saying and tries to practice it.   I just wanted to give you all a little background on him, To help answer my question.   My problem with him is, He just doesn't want to listen to us.   I don't mean when we are saying "Noah NO!" He minds very well.   It's hard to explain. Today I was trying to teach him "NOSE" I was pointing at my nose, took his hand to point to his and he had no interest. I tried some more, but no interest...Didn't want to PUSH it. Then just a few minutes ago I tried again, He wouldn't even look me in the face just kept walking around.   He does watch more Tv then he probably should as young as he is, "Spongebob he LOVES". Could this be causing possibly attention problems?   I know he can hear me, and sometimes I know he's just doing it on purpose & will give me this look and run away.   I dont expect him to be a Rocket Scientist, Everything else he seems to be doing great. But, possible attention problems, and I'm just wondering if Watching to much TV could be causing this? or maybe hes just not ready to start with these kinds of things. Learning body parts? things like this....

Cervix is still long and not effaced, meaning they couldn't even induce at the moment. My doc. is travelling at the end of next week and seems to want me to have the baby before then and told me it's dangerous to go beyond term. I've read that up to 42 weeks is normal. And there is still enough fluid, no calcification, and placenta is still fine. I was two weeks late an my mother was ten days late. What should I do?? My worst nightmare is an unnecessary C-Section.
20090221002547AAXPQ7T	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I got jumped by three girls today?	I was at my job and me and this girl never really got along since I started last year, and she and her three other friends would give me dirty looks everytime I pass by them. Last week, one of her friends from the group got fired and for some reason, the leader thought I probably did something to make my boss fire her, which I DID NOT DO AT ALL!!! So my leader and her friend got mad at me and today they broke one of my copy machines in the office just because I asked them to turn down the radio because I can't concentrate on my job too well with the radio blasting inside my office, so I was out on lunch hour and I came back to find my copy machine competely destroyed, and I know one of them did it because I could tell by the smug looks on their faces, so I yelled at them and told them that now they're gonna have to buy a new one now because THEY broke it!!! And then the leader said that she was gonna beat my face in after work and I said ok, you're all talk anyway, you never do s#it, so a few hours later, I got out of work, and I was out in the streets, and I was going to a friend's house, and then these two girls show up with the one that got fired a week ago, and the leader's boyfriend showed up as well, and then all of a sudden, I felt someone yanking my hair hard and the next thing I know, I was on the floor and the leader was punching me in the face and everything, and I even tried fighting back, but then her two other friends and her boyfriend joined in and they were punching me along with the leader, and they all yanked my hair so hard that it hurts, it still hurts when I try to touch my head, they scratched my face, gave me a black eye, I got a busted lip, my mouth bled for an hour, gave me a bloody nose, and they even managed to rip my shirt off, and I was on the floor crying, I could barely even move, and then they all stomped me in the head and in the back a few times, and they were wearing high heels that day! And the leader's boyfriend even lifted me up from the ground and threw me unto the floor and kicked me in the back like if I were a football! Eventually, my friend came outside and seperated all of them and drove me home, and I cried, and cried for 2 hours, it still hurts now. I could barely even move, my whole body is hurting, and I even reported all of them to the police and now the leader's boyfriend's best friend is mad at me because I sent his best friend to jail and he threatened to come over to my apartment and beat me up more worse then what his friends did to me this afternoon! GOD I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!! what should I do??? I'm 25 years old and these girls are like in their 30's, maybe even 40's!!! And her boyfriend is only 21!!!

I can't remember the exact date I had my period last month so I've been stressing. They're usually never on the exact same day for me, they always vary a few days off or earlier every month. I remember getting my period on dec 25th and it last till jan 2nd..    My boobs are hurting really badly, but I can't really tell if I'm going to get my period like i usually can. I haven't really been bloating, but I have been having cravings.      Am I just stressing out?

20090221015624AAWnhNt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 4 1/2 year old stepson is doing things to hurt his baby sister. How normal is this? How extreme is normal?	I love my stepson "Adolph" no just kidding.. We'll say "Jimmy" as if he was my own, he's smart, loving, and possesses all of the qualities you would want a child to have. Lately every time I turn around he's pinching, hitting, he's even pushed her "Gracey" off the bed before. She's 12 months old, he's almost 5 now. I understand having jealousy towards a new addition to the family or animosity over not having all the attention anymore, but when do I become concerned that it's more than that? I know he loves her, and think sometimes it aggravates him that she's not paying attention to him when he wants to play.   This morning he threw a giant book and just missed her head, he knows Mommy and I are always taking things away she could choke on, yet I catch him putting pennies etc. in her mouth.    Counseling is on the way, originally for other reasons, but now quite a few reasons. I don't want to be too severe with punishments because I think it could add fuel to his fire, but I don't want him to think it's not a big deal by being too soft on him. I try to do things just for him at times while telling Gracey "sorry your too little, this is for big kids" in order to make him feel special too. Should I be that concerned?

I don't throw wild parties at my house, or give them that much of a hard time.     They discipline me when I need it, with either grounding, spanking, or both.        Is it weird to get along this well?  I kind if like the structure.
20090203114006AAFdNcN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	To co-sleeping mommies..does your baby squirm and kick a lot during night?	SO SORRY FOR THE LENGTH. PLEASE READ THOUGH AND SEE IF YOU CAN HELP ME!!       My little one will be 3-months old tomorrow. We've gone through different transitions over the last few months in regards to her sleeping patterns. When I saw that she didn't sleep long in her bassinet, and was turning herself over onto her belly very early, I resorted to co-sleeping so I could keep an eye on her.      Well, the first month she slept ok, would wake at the regular 2-hour intervals to feed and then go right back to sleep.       The second month she slept in longer intervals, sometimes 3-4 hours at a time, would wake to feed and go back to sleep, but at 5:00a.m or so, she'd start grunting and stretching in her sleep, making the last couple of hours in bed very noisy!      Into our 3rd month she'd started to show progress as far as the length of time she slept. She would sometimes sleep up to 5-6 hours at a time, and stopped the grunting and stretching thing. Now though, for the last 2 weeks, she's regressed to the point where she's sleeping for only up to 2 hours but most often waking up at 1 hour intervals. She is squirming her body back and forth, squishing her face into the mattress, kicking her legs out (and into me), and flailing her arms about. She'll do this every 10 minutes or so in her sleep, then calm down and then do it again. It goes on almost all night long now. She seems to be doing it in her sleep but now she's vocal, makes noises (sort of like cooing but then sometimes it turns into a fussing). I resort to giving her the breast, she calms down, seems to go back to sleep again, but then awakens within 45 minutes to an hour.      I've tried the swaddling thing and she just doesn't go for it. I end up with hysterics because she likes to have her hands to suck on. As it is during the day, she hates anything covering her hands.       Anybody else go through something similar to this? Sorry for the length!

Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst... And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life... You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure. But don't worry... you will someday. "   - (American Beauty)      I know this question is kind of random but i'm still in awe of the film.
