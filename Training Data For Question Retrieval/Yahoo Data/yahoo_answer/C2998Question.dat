20090131152516AAAHIf8	Environment;Green Living	Why do many assume the rate at coal fired generation is proportional to usage?	I have seen many responses that people hate the idea of using electricity wastefully because they want to cut down on the use of coal.      With a coal fired generation plant, they have to burn at a high rate 24/7 to keep the superheated steam moving to the generator unit turbines, whether people are actually pulling electricity of or not. The turbine generator has to maintain a constant speed. The regulators mere supply the line for what is pulling across the transmission line, to maintain 60 hertz power.

20090131153211AAT7tnF	Environment;Green Living	What are the most effective ways anti envronmentalists get people to buy their ideas or products?	I wonder what you feel are the most effective methods used, and especially how to counter those methods. Examples are those who deny a human cause to global warming, the paper industry and coal industry.  Also products that have been successful at greenwashing.      Can these be countered rationally or must emotional arguments be used as countermeasures? Please give an effective example.
20090226043813AAUjZ2n	Environment;Conservation	What careers are available in the environmental conservation field?	I'm really quite ignorant about this, but I was wondering what kind of careers deal with environmental conservation and what they entail.  There's probably a bunch of different stuff, but I don't know much about any of it, and I'd really like to.  Again, ignorant, but I was thinking maybe something along the lines of stopping global warming, getting animals back from the brink of extinction, helping the ozone, and decreasing pollution in our air and water.  I'd especially like to focus on the biology aspect of it if possible.  I think that (depending of course what exactly it is) I might like to go into that field, and, soon to be entering high school, I just sort of want some idea on my radar of what I'm eventually going for.  How much science, math, technology, etc. do you have to take?  Anything else I should know?  Thank You so much!!
