20090131114643AAkTVPB	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Wire gauge current capacity?	Hi. I need to wire my garage for a MIG welder and an Air Compressor. I'm running 220V. The wires we have in our market are marked with MM only, as in Millimeter. so my question is if I want to have a 32 AMP capacity, which MM do I have to use. I hae looked at wire gauge tables and can not tell for sure if their MM is same as the MM mentioned on the wires.   Does any one have experience with PVC wires and the MM measurements and their respective current capacities?       Most wires we get here are made in UK.      Thank you for your answers

20090131144052AAUdJzB	Science & Mathematics;Physics	2D motion problem.  Find information about a hawk diving to catch its prey.?	A hawk is flying horizontally at 18.0 m/s in a straight line, 250 m above the ground. A mouse it has been carrying struggles free from its grasp. The hawk continues on its path at the same speed for 2.00 s before attempting to retrieve its prey. To accomplish the retrieval, it dives in a straight line at constant speed and recaptures the mouse 3.00 m above the ground.      (a) Assuming no air resistance, find the diving speed of the hawk.   (b) What angle did the hawk make with the horizontal during its descent?   (c) For how long did the mouse "enjoy" free fall?      I tried 90 deg for b and it's wrong, I don't understand that nor do I understand the other parts.

The following figure shows two different arrangements of three electrical components (1) a voltage source which is a battery, (2) a light bulb labeled âAâ, and (3) a light bulb labeled âBâ. Light bulb A is not identical to light bulb âBâ. For the purposes of this problem assume that a light bulb is âresistor-likeâ and that the brightness of a given bulb depends on the total electric power dissipated.   When these components is connected as shown in the left circuit, Bulb A is observed to be   brighter than Bulb B.   Part (a): Based on this information, which bulb has a greater resistance, Bulb A or Bulb B. Explain   how you know this.   Part (b): Define W as the brightness power of a light bulb. Rank the follow from brightest to   dimmest:   ? WAL = brightness of Bulb âAâ in the left circuit.   ? WBL = brightness of Bulb âBâ in the left circuit.   ? WAR = brightness of Bulb âAâ in the right circuit.   ? WBR = brightness of Bulb âBâ in the right circuit.   Be sure to explain in detail how you got your answer.

20090131151745AANP5UB	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Further question on why we are electrocuted while touching live wire and the ground simultaneously?	I know, most of the people will simply say "because there is potential difference between ground and wire". well, my question now is, why the heck there is potential difference at all? because wire, our body, and the ground don't form closed circuit, so the electric current is not supposed to flow in our body. let me clarify my idea. suppose we have a battery, a resistor, and some wire. now, I make closed circuit: positive pole of the battery-wire-resistor-wire-negative pole of the battery. of course, current will flow in this circuit. Now, if I am touching the wire while my feet standing on the ground, will current flow through my body? I bet no, because wire-my body-ground don't form closed circuit (suppose I use 220 V battery, so the reason isn't "because the potential difference is too small"). but if I change battery into electric generator, I will be electrocuted (because that is how electricity is generated by USA electric company). why is that?

I am making a project for my 3-D design class with references to the urban versus natural environments. I would like to use fog in my design to create a sort-of smoky factory type thing in part of it. I was going to use dry ice and warm water to create the fog. However the space I need the container of dry ice and water to go is fairly small (like 3 inches by 4 inches) so i would like some tips of how to do this. Also, does the water in the dry ice bubble over easily? My piece can't have a water puddle. Also, where can I get dry ice, preferably in small portions? Also, is there any way to keep water hot or at least warm for about 3 hours? Also is there a way to make the dry ice fog black or more gray? Would this work if i add black food coloring to the water? Also are there any containers that dry ice cannot be put in? Any other tips for this would be awesome too. :)

20090131160553AAiNpET	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	How to calculate pressure across several lines...?	This is hypothetical. I'm designing an automatic fire-gel dispensing system activated through the use of fusible links in a pre-loaded system for my cabin and need to figure a few of the calculations out. At this point, it's enough for me to not calculate for pressure drop across X distance from the source, or through bends in the pipe, etc., and I have a specific reason for using two separate vessels.      I have a pressure vessel filled with 80 CF of C02 at 1500 PSI connected to a line with a cross section of 2.5 inches^2 connected to a second vessel filled with water. Between the CO2 and water vessels, a pressure regulator rated to 600 PSI exists.       From the water vessel, I have 6 "exit" lines, each 1inch^2 in cross section. If I want the pressure for each "exit" line to be >=100 PSI, would it be correct to set the regulator between the CO2 vessel and the water vessel to 600 PSI?

20090131171342AAFwdb3	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	What exactly is Enthalpy?	From my textbook it appears that Enthalpy only exists during constant pressure of a system, which is confusing in itself considering the equation (where d is change or delta): dH = dU + d(PV) = dU + dP*V + PdV + dPdV, seems as if it has definition at variables pressures too...      Next point of confusion: dU = q + w where w = -PdV Substituting:      dH = q -PdV +PdV + dP*V + dPdV      Seems as if the two PdV terms should cancel out to give:      dH = q +dP*V +dPdV      Now if Pressure is Constant, the dP terms goto 0 giving      dH = q?      Yet I'm told by my textbook in a constant pressure system that dH = dU + P*dV which makes no sense to me, and that q=dH in this case what is the point of Enthalpy if it only exists at constant pressure and is equal to the heat term of the internal energy equation?      Next, if U is the internal energy of the system then how is H measuring the energy of a system? Why not make H the internal energy of the system?      The reason why Thermodynamics is so confusing is that these terms are completely ambiguous and make no sense. Seems like the best approach to Thermo is to ignore math/logic and blindly use equations.

I'm stuck on chapter Six, hope some one can help      "In 1990, Gary Stewart of California made 177,737 jumps on a pogo stick. Suppose the Pogo Stick reaches a height of 12.0cm with each jump and that the time of contact with the ground between the jump is 0.60s. Find the average net force acing on the pogo stick during the contact with the ground. Assume the total mass of Stewart and the pogo tick is 65kg.

20090131171109AAamn6r	Science & Mathematics;Physics	More help with a Physics problem please...?	A car starts from rest and travels for 5.0s with a uniform acceleration of +1.5 m/s^2. The driver then applies the brakes, causing a uniform acceleration of -2.0 m/s^2. if the brakes are applied for 3.0s, (a) how fast is the car going at the end of the braking period, and (b) how far has the car gone?      I asked this about an hour ago and got some really great answers.  The only thing that I don't understand, though, is why, when I'm finding the negative acceleration, do I have to square time?  I didn't have to square it when I was finding the positive acc, so I don't get why I have to with the neg.  32.25 meters is the correct answer, but I really want to understand this.

I have been doing this problem ALL DAY! its vectors! seriously the easiest crap. and yet. . .HERE I AM      okay: a radar station locates a s(t)inking ship at range 17.3 km and bearing 136 degrees clockwise from north. from the same station, a rescue plane is at horizontal range 19.6 km 153 degrees clockwise from north, with elevation 2.20 km.   a)find vector components of the distance of the plane with respect to the ship (north= y axis, east=x-axis. . .yada yada)    the answer for the components :  x=3.12   y=5.02  z=-2.02    Alright. i got the answer and verified it with the back of the book. HOWEVER, it only works when the distance of the plane from the radar station is 19.6 km. I am thoroughly confused because it said that 19.6 km was the HORIZONTAL range from the radar station. wtf!!!! if i set 19.6 km equal to the x-component(as the phrase horizontal range seems to indicate) it does not work.     in short, i am confused by the wording of the problem. is there a difference between horizontal range and range???? i got the answer, but on terms that dont make sense to me. if you can enlighten me,  I will have you canonized by the pope!

Hello I need a little help getting started to write a small portion of Matlab code to simulate a coin flip game. i have already done most of it, but i dont know how to do this part. I need to simulate a coin toss that is flipped twice for a random "n" number of times. if the outcome is two heads (H,H) then the prize money is $10, if heads, tales (H,T) then it is 7 dollars. If (T,H) then it is $5 and the $0 for (T,T). I was thinking about using a 1 for heads and a 0 for tales. and have a a random variable like HT that is between 0 and 1 for. However, I don't know how to incorporate all this. Thanks for any help.
