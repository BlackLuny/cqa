s2F6pK9Xaa	You should have a NICE cheerful conversation with him for a few minutes then tell him "Well, guess what, dad! You're going to be a grandpa!" He will probably get angry, but telling him that way makes it a *bonus* for him, not a negative for you- like saying "I'm pregnant" would be.<br>  <br>  He will ask you what your plans are...be prepared to go into depth. I know this type too, and they don't let up! "I'll figure it out" is not a good enough answer!<br>  <br>  Be calm and stay firm in your decision. DON'T let him hear you cry, even if he upsets you.<br>  <br>  He will eventually come around. And he will love your child.<br>  Good luck.|`|v3LnJycKaa	um are you my sister, seriously.. thats how my dad is not a debt, perfect credit catholic mamas boy... but listen you are his child and he lectures because he cares. listen to him, dont let him bully you but listen I am sure everything he is saying holds water and validity... you cant fault him for loving you and wanting the best for you, explain that to him, but explain to him that there is another plan for you a different path than he followed you would love for him to walk beside you if he chooses but you understand in some sense you have let him down.<br>  <br>  bottom line do it face to face, it shows that you have more respect for him and that you are willing to face him, over the phone is cowardly and proves your immaturity to him. PS if your debt is only 1000 or so you should have no problem securing a loan for a car. your credit need only be around 615 for a car loan, and depending on your debts 1000 doesnt really constitute EXTREME debt.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Just tell him..."I'm going to be having a baby in July."  He may suprise you...maybe not initially...but he just might suprise you.  You have to hope for the best and prepare for the worse.  If he yells let him get it out of his system...if he puts you down just let him get it off his chest.  He's a parent and all parents pretty much expect their kids to be better then they are...its natural (you'll do the same).  I got married 2 months after knowing my husband...my parents looked at me like I had grown antennae when I told them...sucked it up and repsected I'm an adult and make my own decisions...then bought me quite a few wedding gifts and that was that...treat him just as their own son.  You're dad is going to be an a***hole...you already know that.  Let him.  Did you ever think Mr. Moneybags Show-Off probably will throw all kind of help and gifts your way...he may not agree with what's happened thus far but he has an image to uphold.  So he'll be a proud grandpa if for no other reason because it looks good.  So just be honest...I'm pregnant.  Don't start out by giving explanations or plans...like...I'm going to do this and I'm doing that.  Don't apologize for your baby...just tell him matter of factly and let him put on his show and then move on.  Good luck mama.|`|52U22fiAaa	The fact that he's money-savvy has nothing to do with you having a baby.  <br>  <br>  It's not about HIM it's about you and this baby.  So approach as such.  Tell him you're pregnant, be confident, and if he doesn't like it-too bad.  This is your body, your baby, and your life.  He can support you or turn his back-it's his choice.  <br>  <br>  Just do it, and quick-like a band-aid.  He'll get over it, he's a big boy-lol.|`|9ro8fiKvaa	OK, be prepared and plan on doing this face to face. Practise your speech and when you execute it be calm and let him know that this is your decision and that you are looking forward to having him be a great grandfather to your child. Be prepared for his rants and his questions - go in with the answers, even if they are not neccessarily the ones that you know he will want to hear. If he hears that you have put a lot of thought into this and have a 'plan' then at least he won't be terrified for you. Expect his rage reaction and deal with it. He's your Dad and wouldn't be caught dead missing out on ANY of this experience. Let the news sink in for him and try to understand that it'll be a shock for him. Don't worry about it then - think about taking care of yourself and making your 'plan' come to reality. Your Dad will help you, I promise. Keep well and good luck!|`|BO28Mn8haa	He might be excited about it. You never know. Just tell him. And if he starts b!tching just do what I do. Say<br>  <br>  "that's fine, but I am my own person and I am capable of controlling my own decisions and actions. but I appreciate your input" click<br>  <br>  thats it. good luck.|`|Nlsijci6aa	i hate your dad<br>  <br>  but just tell him quick.
nvH62xo5aa	Honestly, If I have already brought ten children into the world, it would be better to let that one go.|`|Cy9MmTzCaa	In a heartbeat. my child life would mean more to mean than my own. They would be just fine without me because they would have family who cared for them. My whole family is a very tight-knit group, although we're spread out all over the world.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	absolutely. how could you stand by and watch one of your children die and say "oh well, i have 9 more." please.|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	Without a second thought. I would do anything to save my offspring.<br>  How could you live with yourself if you let one die.|`|KDqzj3isaa	of course every childs life is Precious and just beginning, i wouldn't even have time to think about it , natural instinct for me and prob most parents.|`|V5lxDoIRaa	That's a no brainer I would run into that burning building faster than you could imagine|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	Yes I would still go inside for my one child. There would be a dad and other family members to look out for my children. One day they would understand why I did it.|`|40WPuaMpaa	No question, save the one. They would have a wonderfull father, and their Grandparents to raise them.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Not a question in my mind! I would never value my life above someone elses!|`|frpCK0utaa	yes.my childs life would mean more to me then my own.|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	Yes, I would.  I don't think I could be much of a mother to the other children with the guilt and grief I would feel over KNOWING I could have saved the one.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	YES. I would rather my children had a dead father they knew would have risked his life for them, than a live father they knew was too much of a p*ssy to save his child.
ObngW3xxaa	I just turned 16 weeks and I asked the same question last week. I think its the baby but I'm not too sure myself! I've never felt this before and I usually feel it when I'm laying on my left side! Its so amazing that its already that active! Can't wait till I can actually see the kicks!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Yes, most likely. Congrats, that's very exciting! Wait til he/she starts kicking you in the ribs...lol. :]|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Sounds like it.  I'm really small and I felt it at 16 weeks and everyone said it wasn't baby and too soon and that later I'd know a real kick...well at 20 weeks it is more obvious and more often but its the same thing I felt before just harder.  Congratulations...isn't it awesome?!  I just started playing music for the baby (headphones on my stomach) and she goes crazy!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It can either be the baby or gas! Unfortunately at this time it's hard to say which it is, but as it gets stronger and you know for sure, you'll think back to the flutters and you'll know which ones were the baby and which ones were just gas.|`|xMy0QEvFaa	Yes, but wait a couple more weeks when the baby starts kicking your ribs Lol<br>  <br>  Congrats :)|`|v0aKxF6iaa	yes ma'am im sure it is at 15 weeks thats what i was feeling as well! its a wonderful feeling! congrats!|`|kYkKcQJ2aa	Around 12 weeks you should start feeling a tickeling sensation like butterflies but the feeling I had was not the lower part of the belly but right below my rib cage, it is a one of a kind feeling!|`|xaWEdRNWaa	More than likely, it is your baby!  He or she could just be swimming around in your belly!  For me, when I  was around 15 weeks, the baby moving felt like butterflies in my tummy!  Congrats!|`|D0M2AXTGaa	probably! Congrats!|`|4XfjUcvDaa	Yes...it feels as if someone flicks you in the abdomen.  Wait about 3-4 more weeks and you will feel the full force!|`|7RH1WmWOaa	Yes it is your baby, although it could just be those beans you ate earlier today...|`|C1blHL9vaa	Most likely..it feels more like butterflies or flutters in the beginning.
DRb4Qlypaa	They feed the baby and give them oxygen. A big, red placenta that looks like a kidney is a good placenta, and a big fat umbilical cord is a good umbilical cord. The umbilical cord is attached to baby and then cut, and the placenta is delivered after the baby.|`|AA11210211	the Placenta is to get nutrients to the baby and the umbilical cord is a tube running from the baby to the placenta:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta</a>|`|OPTDFRuzaa	These help feed baby and supply oxygen!|`|Nlsijci6aa	they both hold the thing in place<br>  <br>  duh|`|C1blHL9vaa	Is this a joke?
96HWpdkFaa	I'm 10 weeks and 3 days and also bipolar...<br>  I seem to be very moody mostly around my husband. I've been on medication almost my whole life and now I am completely off it while pregnant. So it is extremly difficult.<br>  Keep in prayer and know that you are not alone.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|tivpa7Vlaa	i don't say thats common especially if its happening everyday. during pregnancy i had good days and bad but it wasnt everyday...maybe it has to do with the fact that you do have bi polar. talk to your doctor see what they recommend
mldo1vxYaa	You are pregnant, did you know the average weight gain for a pregnant person is around 4 stone? 68lbs, its not a good idea to diet while pregnant except under doctor supervision. I know you dont want to put on weight but being pregnant you cant avoid it, your baby and the amniotic fluid alone weighs around 19lbs. I would wait until you have had the baby and then try lose any weight you have left, at the moment just relax and concentrate on having a healthy baby.|`|G67ceHtTaa	Well babies only weigh around 7-8 pounds when born, so it will weigh almost nothing at the moment, therefore it's mostly fat you are putting on - but really, that does not matter. It sounds like you are doing everything right by having a balanced diet. Seriously, don't think about dieting right now. Concentrate on the baby. How about going shopping with your mum and putting a bit more fruit and veg into the basket? And doing some exercise, like taking a nice walk each day? That will really help. Other than that - wait till after you've given birth to diet.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	i am the same way i havent gained but 4 pounds at 26 weeks but 6 foot tall so not so noticeable but my face is fatter & my thighs & my bum but i can't fit my pants lol <br>  <br>  u may want to cut out some potatoes because they will make ur bum & thighs bigger rather ur gaining or not
EtCRnDJMaa	I have 3 now ages 8.5, 6.5, & 4.  we are trying for another one. I wasn't ready for another one as soon as the others.  But I am now and It will be total chaos, but it is with 3 too!  I don't mind|`|cAtWxJG1aa	we had four in under seven years.<br>  <br>  is it chaos? sure.  but it was chaos when we had one.  i'm very glad we had the fourth, and i don't think anything feels anymore out of control than when we had three.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	My third one isn't even here yet, and it's already chaos sometimes. It's all in what you make of it. For some, one is too many - for others, four or more is just part of life and you work something out that works for you. It helps to be organized and have a routine, that's for sure. Child spacing can be important - for reasons like one is at school and you're at home with the younger ones, or for me - next year, my oldest will be in kindergarten, the middle one will be in preschool, and I'll be home with the baby. That gives me some built in time to do things like work out (taking the baby with me to the gym) or going to the store, etc. or just sitting around on my butt for 2 1/2 hours while the older ones are gone. LOL It helps to have a supportive spouse, too, which I thankfully have.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I'm the oldest of 5 kids..yeah it was chaos! But i didn't have very good parents. I'd say there are plenty of people who have this many kids and there is not nearly half the amount of chaos that was in my mom's household! I have 3 right now, and it can be slightly chaotic at times, but nothing that i can't stand or cant handle!|`|F7tyzrMzaa	In my household there is: dad, stepmom, me, Dylan (12yr old girl-adopted), Grace & Josh (6yr old twins-adopted), Nate, Caitlin & Tyler (3yr old triplets) and Ari & Cameron (3 month old twins).<br>  <br>  That's chaos! It's beyond belief, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I love them all, and we live comfortably as my parents have great jobs, so it doesn't bother us. We all have our own space and plenty of love from our parents, so we're perfectly happy.|`|f401ea307e44f234284f4730f9d3f181aa	Just had my third, and it can be overwhelming (chaotic can't happen just yet).But I found that at each stage, routines are wonderful for curbing insanity!! So when we go on to have our 4th, 5th or even 6th, routines will be our life savers even more so!!|`|AFjfkrjcaa	We have seven and I've found that after our third it didn't really make a difference how many we had, things stayed pretty much the same.  It also got easier when my older children got old enough to help with the younger children.  My seventh was the easiest because there was always someone to hold him, when he was born I had other children who were 14, 11, and 10, and they were such a big help.|`|X0ubZnPjaa	its already chaos with the 3 that i have but im pregnant with my 4th so i'll soon find out im sure it will be hectic though.|`|CfctPzxtaa	this is funny but my parents have 8, it gets wild at times, but it pays off. big family holidays, and family outings. its fun!
3kW6i3Vdaa	I had false positives from conception to about 2 months. <br>  I was feeling ill and strange but I was convinced I wasn't because of the negative Pregnancy tests.<br>  After that I gave up and thought dayum something MUST me abnormal about me.<br>  I found out three weeks ago I was 15 weeks pregnant...now 18 weeks. Over the moon no less, but still a shock because the tests had been WRONG!<br>  Get a bloodtest, they tell you for sure.|`|BO28Mn8haa	that line doesn't show up until your close to your due date.. you're just over streasing. if anything go to the doctor and get a blood test they don't lie|`|apSTH4TIaa	Yeah the dark line in pregnancy shows up later in pregnancy not in the first trimester.  You just have to go see the doctor.  Sometimes a chemical pregnancy will give you the feelings of pregnancy without the positive test, but only your doctor can check that.  Get a blood test.|`|xw8VOt5Eaa	Some tests come up negative, it's called a false negative.  It happens more often than you think.
reqMMQchaa	One thing you can do is wake him up in the middle of the night (say when you go to bed around 11 or 12 or something) and take him into the bathroom.  He'll be sleepy but his bladder will not be as full and he should be able to make it in time.  Then, when you wake him in the morning, he will not have to pee as badly, and hopefully be able to hold it in until he gets to the bathroom.  This will also train him to wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom to pee if he needs to.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I think you can just leave the pullups on; he will eventually grow out of them, but it may take a while for him to train himself to make sure he has enough time to get to the bathroom in the morning.|`|HgphsCb9aa	That procedure will take time and training, maybe some promoting might help or sheer for him when he almost be able to do it, i mean at the end they will be able to control it, but at 4 its sometimes hard, we grown up sometimes feel the need to really run and do it, how about kids when they dont know what is that feeling and why should they do this there.<br>  <br>  Give yrslf some time and dont worry it will work.<br>  <br>  <br>  my 88 love|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	he might not pee if he has underwear on. maybe wake him a little earlier??  sorry im not much help, my step daughter wasnt a night wetter and my LO is still too young|`|EtCRnDJMaa	if he has on his underwear then he'll know he must hurry!  he might have a few accidents, but will soon learn to get to the bathroom in time.  He'll get there!  He wont be wearing pull ups when he's 16!!!  give him some time, he'll make it!<br>  <br>  <br>  also: tell him that the boys in his class will be having sleep overs soon, and he doesn't want to have any pull ups or accidents, so he must practice first.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	I would make him wear underwear all day....to start teaching him. After about a week or two keep his underwear on all day and night..yeah you will have a few accidents but he will learn fairly quickly.
0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	We respect each other as parents in our home.  It took a few months (or maybe it was even years) of discussion, research, learning, honesty, trusting and more discussion before we both fully understood the other's goals & approaches as a parent and found real respect for each other as parenting partners.   We worked through it all, gently & as honestly as possible, during the down-times, when his daughter was with her mom.  <br>  <br>  His ex has never spoken directly to me or about me, as far as I know.  She didn't want dad involved with his daughter, let alone me.  I was just an added annoyance and, from what I understand, I added hope for her that he would have new children and just forget about his daughter & leave her alone in her little world of make believe victimhood.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Well, my daughter has 2 step parent.<br>  Myself and her bio father are very appreciative of their roles as step parents as of course, not all people are willing to take on a child like it is their own<br>  My daughter listens when her stepparents speak to her, and they are involved in her discipline. They do not make her rules, but if we listen if they have an input and discuss that between ourselves first.<br>  <br>  My ex is very supportive on my husbands relationship with my daughter, just as I am about his wife|`|reqMMQchaa	I am a step-parent to my husband's 9 year old son (whom I have known since he was 2 years old).  My stepson is very respectful of me and listens as well as any 9 yo.  My husband is very appreciative of my role in his son's life - but there are times when I will say its time to go to bed or something and my husband trumps it.. I just let it go, but if it were my own child, I probably would want to lay down some ground rules with my husband about that.  Parents often will spoil their children a bit when they are in a divorced parenting situation because there is some guilt involved, and they want to make sure the child is assured that they love them.  <br>  My stepson's mother is supportive of my relationship with her son and generally appreciates the things my husband and I do for him.|`|HgphsCb9aa	Well am not a step mom to anyone but ill give u my opinion or how do i think for such thing, Your partner should help u getting the full respect as if yr the mom, i mean yr taking a role in the child's life, big one or small one or a very very small one, at the end when the kid is there yr gonna be responsible, so they should give u full trust and support when it comes to raising or when it comes to x's involving anything.<br>  <br>  <br>  my 88 love|`|UfGdoHnaaa	I have been with my fiance since his daughter was 1 1/2 and he appriciates my role supports me when his daughter is having a bad day and feels like she does not have to listen to me. She is six now ans is a total sweetheart most of the time.  If I say no TV  or whatever he agrees with me and backs me up 100% and if he does gisagree we discuss later not in front of the kids. Her mom hates is that her daughter and I have a good relationship, a little bitter iI guess but that's her problem. I thought somone would be happy if their child was being treated good and was being taught the right things....But look on the bright side I am doing the right thing!!!
vygYFdsSaa	Yeah, its too soon for panic right now girl. One day really isn't a big deal, but you should take a test in a couple days if you still don't get it and you are usually very regular|`|35kVNi5oaa	wait a few more days. try not to stress to much because that will just mess up your period even more.|`|Ba5PVgHMaa	One day is no big deal. Some girls always get theirs weeks or months late! Dont stress. =]|`|C8E3fe3xaa	I would wait atleast a week.
LTD0qL6Yaa	Yes everything down there is swollen due to the increased blood flow during pregnancy. And yes everything down there will go back to it's normal size within 6-12 mths after the birth. Good luck...|`|T48smu01aa	ya ha ha I am 28 weeks and 4 days and its really swollen and also It did get fatter because I looked with a mirror the other day and I actually ( I know TMI) had stretch marks done there!!! so yes I go fatter down there but i dunno if it will go back to regular size :)
7XBoIgd6aa	It's normal for every pregnancy to be different weather it's your second or your 5th. I Hope You Feel better!!!|`|uGqYoZNEaa	Totally.  Every pg is different!  My first was perfect.  My second honestly was not the best froom beginning to labor and delivery.
phZR63Rdaa	I'm sorry but that test doesn't work. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/drano.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/pregnant/drano.asp</a>
cEtxBb7taa	it is not researched well but there are indications that if taken in pregnancy it can cause miscarriage or preterm delivery.  It does this because it is believed to stimulate menstruation.  Drugs and herbs that do this people will use as "natural" birth control or as a natural way to terminate early pregnancy.<br>  <br>  With nursing it is just that it is not studied well and they don't know if it can cross into the breast milk and have any effects to your baby.|`|2vBmRcv6aa	Almost any supplement, and medications say not to use while pregnant or breastfeeding without contacting your doctor. They need to protect themselves.  There are some studies showing possible dangers. I guess it's always best to be careful in that situation.<br>  <a href="http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/pcomplications/0,,midwife_3q0k,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/...</a><br>  <a href="http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/pcomplications/0,,midwife_3q0k,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/...</a>|`|7CnCY6LQaa	The FDA doesn't regulate herbals like they do prescribed meds.There isn't enough scientific evidence of the effects of this herbal on pregnancy and breastfeeding.For the safety of the baby its best to follow the drs request about over the counter meds and herbals.|`|p4R1c6fraa	Everything has that warning for pregnant women.It is just to protect the butts of the manufacturers.I do think that St.John's wart is a bit useless.I used to take it and never felt a difference.Just remember to ask your doctor/ Obgyn about any OTC meds you are thinking of taking before you take them.You have to put the baby first even in the womb.
Z8mmsOIqaa	You should take a pregnancy test and / or check with your doctor.  You don't want to start and stop taking the pills whenever because it messes up your hormones.  If you want to switch to another brand so you can have a monthly cycle then discuss that with your physician.|`|CgEQAgXhaa	Why would you want to get your period!?  If I could have one once every three months I would jump up and down!  In all seriousness-  If you stop taking the pill youll just have to start all over again.  Throwing your cycle way out of wack.  If you are not sure if you are pregnant, just go to the store and buy a test.  Its easier and faster just to run up to wal mart.|`|UJ8GSGUGaa	I'd recommend you to stop using the pills. taking pills are only to those you have normal pills...|`|k3QFMb4Laa	Get a pregancy Test.|`|35kVNi5oaa	i'd take a pregnancy test first.
prqrQcd1aa	Tell him daddy is somewhere he is not allowed to go right now. Tell him that daddy loves him very much and that he will be able to see him again soon. Circle the date on the calender for when his father gets out and allow him to count down the days and look forward to see his father. This will make it seem like it is not so much of a long time for him! <br>  I hope "daddy" is done doing things like this that will keep him from seeing his child!|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Lol well if you do dont you dare give him that BS story about chemicals or whatever stupid crap that is....he'll just be pissed at you later in life.  Thats a tough situation...as close as they are i really think you should not let your son see him like that...that can kind of mess him up. I would tell him whats going on though. This isnt like a sex talk where you can cop out by saying oh the stork brought me to you lol.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Mmm, I'm not sure on this one. However, lying is not the right course. He will know somewhere down the road and not appreciate being deceived. You can be gently honest. "Daddy did something that he wasn't supposed to and now he's being punished by having to stay here".|`|pnL5WTXMaa	i would tell him "daddy did something wrong and he is being punished for it". I don't know if I would take my child to visit. I might if he asked. I don't know though unless i was in the situation, but i wouldn't lie.|`|HPtpfqFJaa	No, 30 days IS long for a child, but taking a child to show them their daddy is in jail will be traumatizing and forever have an imprint on the childs life. Beleive me, 5 years from now the child won't remember his dad was gone for that long, I can garuntee that, children don't have a proper perception of time just yet. Just wait it out, he will be fine. <br>  Tell him daddy is on a trip or something. Kids forget things like that easily, but the memory of jail would be everlasting.|`|UfGdoHnaaa	Are you crazy???<br>  <br>  First of all no child should be put in the situation in seeing their parent/s in jail. That chemical story is bull. I'm sure your son and his dad are so close that his dad did not care about what he was doing  that landed him in jail and never thought about how it would feel not to see his son. Sometimes you have to protect your children from situations like this. Can you imagine what this would do to your son?|`|AA11170799	I think he should visit his dad and you shouldn't lie to him. There are tons of kids visiting their dads at the jail. You don't have to tell him the whole truth, but you shouldn't lie to him. Some jails have a place where a child can be in the same room with the parent- not just through a window.|`|TBaf74bfaa	No just say his dad went off for a vacation,but let them talk to each other on the phone.I don't think a 4 year old is  ready to have the experience of Jail.|`|e9kvxIc3aa	Jail is no place for a 4 or 5 year old...think of something else to tell him, but the 30 days will go by fast...they have short term memories..|`|60203fef7d7aa03bf1920ab812cbacaaaa	No don't make an early memory for your son be like that.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	30 days is alot, but your son does not need to be subject to a jail. His dad is in jail, hopefully he will learn to turn from his life of crime for his son.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Either way, he isn't being set to a good situation. I would go with not seeing him for 30 days and say he went on a trip, but if he really wants to see his dad, I would go visit him.
vKQfp6cgaa	You can't get pregnant from either.  You get pregnant when sperm enters your vagina.|`|ggFUW3Kvaa	i would think that if the dude has his finger covered in sperm and is fingering you that would be most likely way of getting pregnant.|`|vZgAXcPEaa	neither.<br>  go to the library and read about it.<br>  if not you'll be fooled several times with silly tales
1YdeUn1Caa	My Dr. told me not to quit. Quitting causes stress and will harm the<br>  baby. So I cut back to 5-7 a day. The result. 3 pregnancies, 3 big<br>  and healthy babies. All because I listened to my Dr. His advice<br>  benefited my children.<br>  Just relieve yourself of any stress you have. That means ex's too.|`|AA11851394	first thing you should not have put yourself with him. please don't take your problems out on the innocent unborn child. when you were having pleasure it was sweet as the old saying what sweeten goat mouth will bitter its belly.|`|CJvHQl5vaa	Okay, first of all...Stop.  Just stop and take a very deep breath.  Right now.  Take two, for that matter.  I know you are upset, and you have the right to be, but take a minute to steady yourself, because you are going to make it through this whether or not you stop and try to relax, so you might as well try for a minute to relax.<br>  <br>  You need to take a look at the situation and consider what you can control and what you can't control.  It would help to make a list, one of what you can control and one of what you can't control.  <br>  <br>  You can control:  Whether or not you smoke, whether or not you take a prenatal vitamin, whether you make a point of taking deep breaths and relaxing, which is good for your baby.  You can control whether or not you get prenatal care. There is more that you can control, so keep going with this list.<br>  <br>  Next, make a list of what you can't control.  You can't control your ex.  You can't control his behavior, employment, whether or not he can support this baby, whether or not he will step up, etc.  <br>  <br>  Once those two lists are made, you need to look them over again, and realize that what you need to focus on is the stuff you can control.  THAT is your job as a Mommy right now.  Take charge of what you can control and do your best for your own self-care and your baby's self care.  Manage your stress, work on quitting smoking, get good nutrition.  Try to do things that will make you laugh a lot or make you happy.  Try to remember that whatever you put in your body, you are putting in your baby's body.  Whatever you tolerate in terms of noise, stress, etc, you are asking your baby to tolerate.  Any negative things you say to yourself are also effecting your baby.  This is time to turn the ship around and make your little part of the world into the ideal place to take care of yourself and the baby.  THAT is your job right now.  You can't worry about your ex.  He is going to have to take care of himself.<br>  <br>  There are some resources out there that can help you.  WIC is one of them.  They provide assistance to low income pregnant, nursing mothers and mothers of children under the age of 5.  The general WIC website is <a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/</a>  I suggest you call them tomorrow and relay them your situation and ask for help.  Their services don't just include nutrition assistance, but they also offer classes to help teach you things like how to make nutritious, delicious meals on the cheap, and may be able to refer you to support in helping you quit smoking and getting ready for baby.<br>  <br>  Use the WIC website to get in touch with the WIC in your area, and get plugged into to their network of assistance.  Then, start taking as good care of yourself as you would want to take care of your baby.  Long bubble baths, relaxing music, healthy food, walks in a pretty park, vitamins and gentle exercise is what you and your baby need right now.  <br>  <br>  There is a prayer called the Serenity prayer.  It starts "God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."  That is exactly what you need to do:  Accept what you cannot change, take courage and change the things you can, and only focus on the things you are able to change.  <br>  <br>  I know you are really stressed out right now, and for good reason, but let me take the time to say Congrads on your pregnancy!|`|3dMoSQT2aa	hi friend. Seems like your life is complicated. But not to worry because with time things get better. First, stop smoking. If not for your health, then for your baby. You dont want more problems and birth defects when your baby is born, so quit now. You have to talk to your boyfriend (bf). You say you love him, but hes not serious and you drive around town looking for him. Talk to him and tell him honestly how you feel and tell him he has responsibility. If he doesnt listen and is not serious, you have to forget about him and move on. Dont look for him and dont think about him, eventually you will find better. Moving away wont solve your problems. Running away somewhere is not really an option. Im sure your mom will help you thru it. Again talk it out with your bf, help him look for work, and if he is not into you, no point of just sitting there and weeping and getting stressed. Move on. In times of stress and hardships like what your facing, turn to god, he will help you more than anyone else. Goodnite!|`|5h8bYsKdaa	wow yeah that sounds stressful. i was thinking, if you could find a hobby that might help you. start going to church maybe and finding a good support group for single moms.<br>  <br>   it could change, he might grow up and see that you are going to be his babys mom. it might seem more real to him when you get an ultrasound. ive noticed when you ignore a guy or pretend you dont care, they kinda want you back. just be nice to him, relax and find something to do and enjoy your pregnancy. <br>  <br>  you cant make someone love you, and you cant make someone love your baby....but....if they are a good person they will. most people dont notice what they have until its gone. maybe he'll figure it out before its too late.<br>  <br>  im sorry you are going through this and just keep being strong, its hard to quit but you are doing a good job! go shopping, take care of you and your baby before any man.<br>  <br>  -gabriella mom of 4|`|t46lboAMaa	Well whether he is your ex or not is unclear to me, but I think what you need to do right now is put you & your child first. If this guy is not going to be a help, you and your baby will be better off without him. I mean really, do you need two children? It is hard enough to be a good mom without somebody trippin with your head all the time. If this guy won't grow up and help you out forget him. Extra stress of a bad relationship will only take its toll on the health of your baby. My daughter really made me grow up when she was born because I wanted only the best for her and I knew I could not provide well for her f I didn't grow up. If this baby belongs to your ex. you might talk with him about what the child deserves and whether he is willing to grow up and help you provide for the best interest of the baby. If he doesn't seem to be into the babies well being, get on with life without him. I hope all goes well for you.
YFPMcHCbaa	Wait a few days and test again. All of the symptoms you get during pregnancy can be related to something else.
d3jtRA8caa	Chances are if your scared, then she is terrified. Be there for her, be emotional support no matter what you guys chose. If you don't want to get married don't but for Gods sake be there for her and the child. Don't be a spineless boy and run off away from it. You'll be fine, just find a trusted adult to talk to.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Get a job, tell you parenst and work your tail off. Childhood is over for you two so man up and do the right thing.<br>  Be sure and tell both sets a parents, get her to see a doctor ASAP.<br>  At her age she need lost of support, her body is young for this.<br>  If you want no more babies, get her on BC as soon as the baby comes and buy you a goss of condoms. After childbirth a women is very fertile and can get pregnant for having sex just one time. So NO unprotected sex.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	you are the right age so you can start looking for a job. It is your responsibility to provide for your child. It is hers too but at the moment she might not be able to get a job since she is pregnant but she can still try. You don't have to rush into moving in with each other and you don't have to get married. You shouldn't make any rash decisions like that because she is very hormonal and you don't want her just going on her emotions and not making good decisions. Even if you two don't stay together, you are still going to be connected to your child forever. I hope everything works out.|`|orpxidX8aa	Start to plan, hopefully you will both finish school and then decide your plans for college with a child. I know some universities try to help parents, there is also the chance of getting some federal aid for college since you have a dependent.  Be supportive of her, she is likely just as scared as you are. You both can get through this, its throws a big wrench in what is considered the "Plan" but you two will just do things differently. So baby, college, career instead of college, career, baby.<br>  Keep your chin up, take care of your girl and your upcoming child.<br>  And hey in seriousness  . . .  congrats|`|qJaKF24naa	Get a job to pay for the baby and support your girlfriend anyway she needs you. It will all work out fine! Good Luck!|`|ePcMIxUWaa	Don't let anyone force marriage on the two of you. Just  be in that babies life and support it.|`|aEKCcxwAaa	How come NOW you are scared? The sex was fun,but then you were not scared. That is life,be a man,be responsible for your actions and learn to obey the rules. Now go to work,take night courses and support this girl and her baby. Talk to your religious mentor if you have one. If you don't,get one. You must learn from your mistakes.You cannot undo what was done.
rFwGnZIJaa	First of all, decide for yourself what you would like to do about the baby, kept it, have it adopted or abortion. <br>  <br>  Second, forget about the man. You can not build a relationship that is healthy. He has already destroyed the trust and has disrespected you by lying. He is only good for child support. He will just hurt you again if you stay with him.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.<br>  <br>  All i can is - You can raise a baby without a man ~<br>  Anything you set your mind to you can achieve it.<br>  <br>  If he wants to be with you - and you want to be with him. Make sure he signs those divorce papers. but if it seems like he is trying to avoid it. Leave him. he is the father but not worth it. Speak to him and tell him straight out wht you want from him<br>  <br>  god bless x|`|tivpa7Vlaa	d@m thats messed up....i guess the ball is in your court. just come to reality of the situation that u are in. he is married and probably will not leave his wife and if he does do you really want a liar(and this is no white lie) for a man in your life. he can take responsibility for his baby but that doesnt mean that he has to be in a relationship with you.  so all in all you are the one who need to run the show here don't him make decisions for you (obviously he is bad at decisions).|`|h5cFkP35aa	he's right, don't abort it. but you also shouldn't be with him. if he lied to you about something so serious, why would you want to? this should be a great indication to the type of person he is. you can do it on your own or with someone else. theres lots of guys out there who like pregnant chics and want a child - weird i know but its true lol. just think about it.|`|oem5yEUDaa	Just remember if he choses to stay with his wife he is not always going to be available to you and your baby. Tell him to make his decision and to make it now, if he is only half there for you it will hurt more than him not being there at all.|`|AA11435607	u should leave him  and not talk to him anymore. he is a jerk for doing that to u.. here my email address if u need a friend.. efrain78223@yahoo.com

4XfjUcvDaa	I have an ultra sound next week as well.  i will be 28 weeks then.  The main purpose of my ultrasound is to make sure that the baby is right on schedule with weight gain.  They will also check the babies organs....as long as they are able to be seen.  Having an ultrasound at this late in the gestational period is harder since the baby is a lot bigger and it is hard to view everything.|`|GUUgeptjaa	They check the babies size,make sure it is growing appropriately, they also check your fluid to make sure you have enough, they check the babies measurements which relates to growth and if you do not know the gender yet they can tell you, or if you're like me and the ultrasound tech is nice they can confirm that the gender is the same as told before....|`|SiIuJXvwaa	to make sure your baby is growing well the measurements of the baby  and even to find out the sex but its routine it will be ok|`|AA12099603	to check the baby's measurements, organs and they can also tell you the sex<br>  congratulations hun<br>  xxx
GC31LZCeaa	It honestly depends on the person.  With my morning sickness all I could stand to eat that didn't make me sick where potatoes, ice cream, and smoothies.  Since you grew up eating apples when you weren't feeling good, your system is used to that and it acts as a comfort food to you.  As long as the apples aren't making you more sick but making you feel better, stick with them.  Your husband probably heard growing up that you shouldn't eat apples on an upset stomach or heard that eating too many can make you sick.  Tell him you appreciate his concern for you and the baby, but the apples are helping you and not making it worse.  Like I said before, what works for someone may not work for another but the apples are working for you so keep munching them.  Plus they are good for you and the baby.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	for each its' own. if apples work for u, then that's fine. i don't agree w/ him bout the apples being too hard of food, BUT eating too many apples in one day isn't as good for u as u might think bc it can rise blood sugar levels and also might give u a stomach ache in some cases. there r also other reasons not to eat too many apples, i wish i could remember, but if u look it up, maybe u'll find something.<br>  <br>  for my morning sickness, i ate fruit and when i felt like i was bout to puke, i chewed on mint.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	thats stupid about the taste haveing to be bland! bland stuff makes me feel worse sometimes. they say sour can calm your stomach along with cinnimon. the sour stuff works for me i eat green apples to clam my stomach to! they have that little bite to them enough to calm it down and get something in there! also for some reaosn pudding is doing wonders this pregnancy. one thing i HAVE to stay away from though is milk in the mornings!|`|4XfjUcvDaa	If the apples are working for you then keep doing it.  For me the only things that help my morning sickness are blow pops, strong flavored gum, and saltine crackers.
t0mb150gaa	At the doctors they will perform blood and urine tests to confirm pregnancy and tell you to start prenatal vitamins. I am assuming your first appointment with your midwife would be the same as with an OBGYN...where they sometimes perform a pap smear and schedule you for an ultrasound ..they will also check your weight and address any concerns..they also usually use a fetal heart rate monitor..this is at least how i remember it and it is done in Canada.  Congrats!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It depends on your Dr.'s policies and your situation. My Dr. did an ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy at the first appointment then gave me a bunch of information and answered questions, checked weight, blood pressure. At my 2nd appointment they did the pap test, blood work, another ultrasound (to check for down syndrome) weight, blood pressure, urine sample and family history. I've hear that many Dr.'s do what I had at the 2nd appointment at the first. I got into the habit that every time I go for my appointment I always ask them what happens at the next one so I have 4 weeks to get myself prepared for what's to come. Good luck to you!
B6iKj7Qwaa	i had the same thing happen to me.. except my period was 5 days nd super light and i usually get heavy periods.. now i have  lot of the pregnancy symptoms but the hpt keep coming back negative.. so i feel your pain.. maybe its stress for you? working out and stuff...? idk.. if you find anything out let me know! sorry i couldn't help much :( best of luck with you.... much love|`|c88406c33ed216877628e7bfcb6d5c27aa	it sounds like your cycle is a little goofed up.  I would guess you are not pregnant.  also, if you can't afford a doctor visit then you definitely cannot afford a baby.|`|AA12099603	its a fact that if you have a sudden change in diet/lifestyle, it can affect your periods........<br>  i doubt you are pregnant, and think its more likely to be down to your change in lifestyle...................<br>  Hope you get this sorted :)

46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Your second appointment is very run of the mill appointment. Itll include a urine sample to test for any protein and things like that. The doctor may try to find the babies heartbeat with the doppler. S/he will also measure your fundal height. Youll also get weighed and the doctor will check your blood pressure. Most of your appointments will go just like that. <br>  We are excited about friday, because our BIG u/s is on that day. I cannot wait to find out if well have another girl, or another boy. I just want to go shopping!!!|`|ObngW3xxaa	I'm so geeked to find out myself!!! Its seriously killing me not knowing what it is! I hate referring to it as "IT" I have an appointment as well this Friday but I'm only 16 weeks and I don't think they can tell me just yet. Usually around 20 weeks I hear! I can't wait!!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	yes! but to me it was just a confirmation of what i already knew.<br>  <br>  i just knew i was going to have a boy...and i was right!|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	This is my 3rd baby. And finally were going to find out. We didn't with the last 2. But we said if we were going to have another, we would find out. Yes I am very excited. Mind you I am only 8 weeks, but still none the less, I can't wait. I want to know if I am right ( I think girl, strong feelings and he thinks boy ) or if he is. Seriously though we don't really care what we have, as long as its healthy. <br>  And I don't know what they will be doing at the 2nd appointment. They didn't explain it to you?|`|8am8ExsKaa	Yes!!! I am 16 weeks with baby #2 and I have an ultrasound scheduled for the 25th to find out the gender. I am sooo excited. I am praying for a little girl. I have an almost 3 year old son. I also have a 9 year old foster son whom my husband and I have had since he was 5, we are in the process of adopting him. Both of my boys are hoping for a little sister. I feel like it is a girl, my pregnancy this time is TOTALLY different from my son 3 years ago. Best wishes!|`|yPNvecc7aa	I was super excited to find out the sex! Surprisingly, everyone I know who's having a baby did not want to find out. I don't understand that! How can you resist the temptation!? LOL (That's just me I guess.)<br>  <br>  You'll find that your appointments are rather boring. They weigh you, take your blood pressure, measure you, then listen to the heartbeat. If you have any questions the doctor will answer them. All in all, you're in there for like 10mins.<br>  Some of the appointments feel like a waste of time, but it's very important that they keep tabs on all of this stuff.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|v0aKxF6iaa	Im super excited! Tomorrow I have an appointment for my amniocentesis and I'm hoping maybe the sonogram will be able to show us but I'll only be 17 weeks tomorrow.

But I also want the results to make sure my baby is okay!|`|Eqln1jmNaa	i was actually going to wait until delivery to find out the sex of my baby, until it came closer to when I would actually be able to find out.. then I just became weak and just HAD to know... and I'm so happy that we did, it was just amazing to actually see what you can look forward to in the future... plus theres deff no mistaking that were having a boy, if you know what I mean * junk is deff there!*|`|ckxpknr0aa	We found out with our first and totally LOVED knowing, really helped us prepare and bond with him. Have my 20 week scan for no2 next week and will find out again..... so excited and can't wait! We've already said if baby is crossing his/her legs we will pay for a private scan to find out!!<br>  <br>  I'm not sure whether your appointments are the same as we get with our midwives over in UK, but usually they will just test your wee, blood pressure, feel position of uterus and listen for heartbeat with a doppler. They may also speak to you about any grants / benefits you can get along with the usual advice about choice of hospitals / pain relief etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope it all goes well!!|`|03f100b7d34df8ee17796e093fefa637aa	Currently 36 wks and don't know the sex of the baby yet.  We are super excited to find out once the baby is born and be able to hold this bundle of joy.
ZR7sikznaa	all I can remember is the paperwork and blood work. they may check your urine, weight, blood pressure, vitals, and do a pap smear. and give you a another appointment in the next month or so|`|yB5go5wbaa	paperwork and blood work. they may check your urine, weight, blood pressure, vitals, and do a pap smear. that's all I can remember!|`|XhIYAH6Laa	This appt is dedicated really to getting all of your medical background. <br>  They also will do a pap if you haven't currently had one.<br>  Also, check your blood pressure and weight.<br>  Ask you if you have any questions (so make a list if you have any)<br>  Give you a script for prenatals if you don't already have them.|`|BhZmRJSBaa	mostly questions questions questions! lol very fun. Congrats on your bundle and Good luck =D
BhZmRJSBaa	usually when you are laying down is when you can feel the baby move the best. congrats on your bundle and good luck! =D
UUtTDAJraa	Well it's normal to not have a sex drive while pregnant. It really is different with everyone. Who knows if after you will regain it back. It could be months, even years. I was in your situation with a no sex drive and it's not pleasant. I tried dieting and exercising but it didn't do anything. Until I tried this natural herbal enhancer which is meant to increase the sex drive along with other things I've noticed. It's a topical oil called Hersolution Gel which is like an instant libido boost. Along with that my sensations are just blasting and my orgasms are then best. Read up about it at herenhancement.com where I saved on it at the time. It got better with every application. I was skeptical at first but the companies return policy made me commit. From what I remember you have to try out for a couple months but then after that you can return it if it doesn't work. It would work great for your situation considering your pregnant and theres no need to swallow anything. Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|r782jijgaa	Talk to your doctor.  When I was about 8 months pregnant is when I quite wanting to have sex.  My belly was so big it was uncomfortable.  Ask you doc if he has any tips on how to nake it easier or more comfortable.
eDmdkUO3aa	I honestly don't have any stories like that. Going into labor and my husband seeing everything that was going on down there was pretty embarrassing. Like the fact that I had bad hemmorhoids (which he never had) and then afterward he told me that he thinks I pooped during labor. Oh well, I didn't care too much at that point, would've been better if he wouldn' t have told me!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	lots of stuff really but they were "you had to be there moments" that happened at work. but after i had my son - about 6 weeks or so fiance and i got into doing the deed and since i had a weak bladder from pregnancy and birth i peed all over the bed and couldn't control it. i was mortified. i mean what a turn off- you start having sex again after a while of not having it and your girl pees all over the bed lol  he just shook it off though- he's like no big deal this kinda stuff happens and i'm like yeah when have you seen that lol<br>   oh when i was in labor my fiance thought that they stuck their whole arm up you to check for dilation|`|ROJans2Taa	that is pretty hilarious, mine isn't as bad, but when I was pregnant with my daughter I was 16, living with my mom and boyfriend, we were trying to set up this tent like thing in her yard and they needed help, it was in the dead of summer, I didn't really having any good summer maternity clothes so I wore these tight spandex shorts with a tank, I just slipped on some high heel sandals and went out to help, we were in the front yard and people were staring from cross the street, my mom looked at me and said I think I know why they're staring, you like a two bit hooker,lol. which in retrospect I did, 16, pregnant, big belly, tight little shorts high heels, we all had a good laugh, would have loved a pic of that.|`|59GymH27aa	I don't really have an embarrassing story...however, my brain turned to mush for a few weeks when I was pregnant and I started putting things in the strangest places.  I found the remote control in the fridge.  I washed my handbag with my purse and all my money still inside. I accidently poured orange juice over my cereal.  Goodness knows what was going on.  I have also done exactly what you done but more embarrassingly I wasn't pregnant at the time! lol|`|OPTDFRuzaa	That made me laugh lol! my embarassing story was when i was 38 weeks pregnant with my second i thought my waters were leaking away and called my midwife she told me to put a pad on until she got there, once she arrived i had to take it off in fron of her on the bathroom then she had to smell it to see if it was my waters. luckily it was a late pregnancy discharge lol! highly embarassing but hey..|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	This happened the morning that I was in labor. <br>  I was 40 weeks, 5 days pregnant by this point. I think that I had been in early labor because I kept getting contractions, but nothing painful and they were far enough apart. We went for all you can eat crab, and at 11 pm, we bought some castor oil because I was ready to get the show started. At 11:30pm, I took 2tbs. By 1 in the morning we were walking around the block, to see if it would easy the pain. I didn't even think to go to the bathroom. I guess with the painful contractions, that was my main focus. We left for the hospital at 2:45am and got there at 3. By 5 am I was ready to push ( my son was coming very fast, labor and delivery took all of 4 hours ) and as I was pushing, I kept pooping on the delivery bed. My doctor who was delivering me, kept having to wipe me.<br>  <br>  Now pregnant with baby #3, and I will not take castor oil.|`|s1utniuvaa	I am caught between my boobs popping out or the peeing myself thing... I guess I can start with the boobs...<br>  I was big in the chest before I got pregnant and now they are just unmanageable. They make the cute maternity tops for an ever expanding belly but not the ever expanding chest apparently. Most of my tops I have to smoosh the girls into... well I was at my really good friend's little sisters sweet 16 party and my friend came rushing over to me and told me to fix myself... I didn't even feel the slightest breeze but when I looked down there wasn't much left to the Imagination. Boy did those 15 and 16 year old boys get a peek!<br>  <br>  Then there is the wonderful peeing thing. Before I was brave enough to wander near the poise area I got a bad cold with a cough. I was in the car and had a coughing fit and ended up peeing myself... hubby and daughter were totally grossed out and I asked him how he thinks I feel! At least he can cough or sneeze and not wet himself. Now almost every day he asks me... So didja piss yourself today. And then he laughs... It was even more fun when it happened at work and I had to go home and change!|`|GUUgeptjaa	I think the most embarrassing thing so far for me in pregnancy is peeing on myself when coughing, sneezing, walking, laughing, its just really like there you are cracking up and then you feel a little gush and its just a show stopper|`|BWUlksmmaa	Ha ha that's really funny!  I haven't had any..yet...but am finding myself passing wind in front of my husband without knowing it was coming - not that I mind, I'd do that anyway, but now I'm just waiting for it to happen in front of a stranger, or in a meeting etc.  Oh dear.|`|5cfrig5Eaa	that was funny|`|oN9UNGZfaa	this really made me laugh thank you|`|Qd5fQpMYaa	Oh man. I think the most embarrassing thing that has happened to me was the first time I had to shave down there after my belly started to pop. I thought it would be simple because I'm not really that big, until I got into the bathtub and realized that it's IMPOSSIBLE to bend far enough over to see under my belly. So I stand up and am bending in all kinds of positions trying to see down there and my boyfriend walks in. I swear the only thing that would have made him laugh at me more would have been if I fell over. I'm sure I did look pretty ridiculous.|`|qZINunh7aa	the day my mom was going into labor our dad was at work 40 minutes away. My big sis, 16, and I 15, didn't have our licenses but we offered to drive her to the hospital at 5 o'clock in the morning.<br>  She freaked and shouted that unless we called dad's job and got him up here she was going to drive herself to the hospital.<br>  My dad arrived & took her. An hour later he came back to get me & my sisters. We got a call just as he stepped through the door from a nurse saying my mom had the baby right after he left the hospital!|`|wTYh7DiSaa	My husband has never heard me fart, ever. Not even when we were dating and he always tease me about it. He asks if I am normal. So just a week ago, sitting in our living room floor with our son, I let out a small fart. My husband whipped his head around (I am sure to see where the "sound" came from, or to at least investigate if I had in fact farted since that would be like watching apocalypse happen!! lol). I pretended not to notice anything as I continued to watch the T.V. I wanted to laugh so hard because I could see his expression in my peripheral vision, he looked like he wanted to jump up and down and say: HA! I got you now! But, not sure if I even farted so he had to let it go. Oh and by the way, I am careful about letting out wind because my 14month old monster imitates it, you can't slip up with this nugget, he will make sure that everybody know you farted.<br>  <br>  HAHAHAHA! I still want to laugh about it.|`|cix2DEbbaa	OH GOODNESS that`s hilarious i got a good laugh out of that!!!!<br>  <br>  I don`t have anything terribly embarrassing yet, you know the public need to pass gas, the usual all us pregnant women go through HAHA!|`|n4I0EKa7aa	How ironic because that happened to me too!!!  I had to go so badly, and I didn't even think about pulling my panties down.  <br>  <br>  My most embarrassing moment came at a doctor's appointment, and I was getting a culture done or something like that, and lo and behold, I let out a tremendous fart (sorry about that word) while the doctor was examining me.  !  I was mortified, and the doctor said, "Happens to me all the time."  I wanted to get up and walk out, but I suppose I was a little too tired to care!
GUUgeptjaa	These below can and basically staying with your partner, making sure he is faithful, and you are....or if you are not with a partner either use condoms....<br>  <br>  Bacterial Vaginosis<br>  <br>  Chlamydia<br>  <br>  The other ones are just about being careful and they are rare....<br>  <br>  Foodborne Infections<br>  <br>  Toxoplasmosis<br>  <br>  Parvovirus B19 (Fifth Disease)<br>  <br>  Rubella<br>  <br>  Again these are rare to cause miscarriages (all of the above) and yes they can be preventable and they can def be treated and not cause harm when caught early|`|wqL84O8Naa	you can't prevent everything, learn that now or being a parent is going to be the most anxiety inducing experience EVER
XhIYAH6Laa	I had a constant headache at the beginning of my pregnancy...I was like you taking tylenol 3 times a day with really no relief. I made sure that was okay with my doctor and she said yes. I guess it's just hormones, because after 2 weeks straight of it, it went away.|`|6L4fCcyGaa	were around the same time.I been having a constant headache too, i thinkits pretty normal. I dont take nothing for mine just ice it lol ..|`|nISjD0dHaa	Headaches are common during pregnancy.  It is due to the hormones.  Tylenol is perfectly safe during pregnancy.  I took it whenever needed and all of my children were perfectly healthy.  I hope the headaches get better for you.<br>  Good Luck.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	I get really really bad migraines, to the point where I can't do anything but lay in bed--can't even eat or sleep, or even open my eyes. My doctor prescribed me Tylenol 3 with Codeine, and I checked with 2 other doctors and the pharmacist to ensure it was safe for me to take. I've only had to take it a handful of times, but it does help much more than regular Tylenol (I'll still have a little headache, but nothing to get in the way anymore) and I don't have to keep taking more and more to feel any better. If you're taking regular Tylenol that often and still in pain, you should talk to your doc about getting something stronger that's safe, that way you can take the recommended dosage once and be done with the headache rather than dragging it on.<br>  <br>  Congrats on the pregnancy, good luck, and feel better!! :)
FgAPXhVRaa	It was stages of love for me if that makes sense. When I found out I was pregnant, it was really surreal.  When I went in saw her heart beat for the first time... I started to fall in love. I went to the ER because I was having spotting. It was a total realization that this was a little tiny helpless human that depended on me and I was going to do everything in my power to help her strive and survive! When I went on for my first prenatal visit and all the spotting had stopped and I officially got the ok that everything was going great and I heard her little heart beat, I was totally enamored. Then when I felt her first move... I fell really hard, really really hard! Then when I found out that she was a girl, it just made me realize that I was really going to be a mommy! Now every time I go in and see her, which is at least once a month because I am high risk, she always turn her face to look at me while they are doing the ultrasound and all I can think about is how I cannot wait to hold her and see her little eyes looking back at me! I cannot wait to know the love that I will feel when I first hold her in my hands! :)|`|T9fek24eaa	I was that way with my daughter. I knew she was there, I was already feeling movement, saw the first u/s at 9 weeks, heart her heartbeat several times, but when they said "Its a girl" it really sunk in that I was going to have a baby, a daughter, a real human being. We already had a name for a girl picked out and it was like putting a name on it all. I understand where you are coming from...|`|YCFgIRufaa	I think it became real for me when I felt it move. I was actually upset at the ultrasound because I wanted a girl.  And then I felt like a bad mom for feeling that way but now I am happy and can't wait to meet my lil boy.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	When I found out I was having a girl with both my pregnancies, I was thrilled. Up until then I never really felt pregnant and was going to have a baby, but when I found out I was going to have a daughter, and then another daughter, it all became real to me.
QLopvWKDaa	I wouldn't be too concerned, however this is one of those noteworthy signs, that the doctor would like to know about.<br>  <br>  My daughter sat like "a lead balloon", pretty much through out my pregnancy! My son did back flips right up until labour!<br>  <br>  Give them a call- they my just note it on your chart, or schedule am ultrasound to put you at ease and assure all is OK.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I wouldn't be concerned sometimes they will move constantly during the day and night, sometimes they will only move during certain times of day. Then on other days they won't seem to be moving around much a all. Maybe the little peanut was just perfectly comfortable yesterday and didn't feel the need to shift about. I'm sure everything is fine. Congrats and good luck!!|`|BGcVEjfGaa	just as you may feel more tired and lazy one day, your baby will as well.  As long as your baby IS moving I wouldn't worry too much.  However, if you really are worried about it a quick call to your dr or nurse will help allay that fear.  They do know better than we can.  As long as what movement there is is strong, don't work yourself up too much.  It isn't good for you or your baby.<br>  Please don't hesitate you call your doctor though if you think something is wrong.  It is their job to take care of you and your baby.
QLDoKll1aa	Later on in your pregnancy, towards the end, you'll have to do more of a squat but until then bend all you want. Just don't go crazy...|`|g9ZFjl6paa	your fine. you can pick things up. your baby is very tiny and protected.|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	unless your dr. tells you specifically to do sit or lay down most of the time...your fine to go on about your normal life. <br>  <br>  sorry to say, if you were really going to lose your baby from bending over to pick up a 2 lb. dog bowl...you are going to lose your baby no matter what, a pregnancy that fragile would never last.<br>  <br>  i have a 35 lb toddler who i pick up everyday, yes my body was used to it already...but your body is used to picking up a dog bowl.<br>  <br>  stop stressing over nothing.|`|TZydDRJvaa	Its good to be cautious especially first trimester but getting things off the floor I think should be safe... <br>  I work for a cleaning company always on my feet and bending down and getting things off the floor my doctor says its good to stay active as makes labor go faster...<br>  as you get bigger bending down will become a harder task and stuff but I think you are safe :)|`|nwWBddEnaa	of course you can the only thing is when your a bit bigger, its harder to bend down, i wish you all the best x|`|BWUlksmmaa	Sure!  Its well protected in there!  Just don't do too much - stuff you didn't do before being pregnant etc.|`|AA11043633	you can do just anything just be careful and don't stress yourself too much.
HIRYscJlaa	depending on what your sick with but a cold or flu no...if it's a virus or disease then maybe ask your doc|`|kiaiXcjsaa	no.not at all|`|m0vcnArfaa	no|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  Your baby isn't sick just because you are.|`|S4soZUFCaa	He/she has the same blood as you, so if it's a blood carried sickness, yes.
OXxKTM6vaa	No it is quite common for people to have periods throughout their pregnancies. Get her to take a test just make sure AND also.......... check for STI's. She could have those even if she isn't pregnant.|`|TZydDRJvaa	I completly understand your worry for your friend I would be worried too..<br>  Periods during pregnancys happens alot usually the first month most pregnant women still have a period and are a month along its normal...<br>  so maybe she should get tested because if shes unprotected having sex its very possible...<br>  so just tell her that periods are common in pregnant women <br>  both my pregnancies the first month I HAD a period and I WAS A MONTH ALONG so yeah...|`|4smxkg9caa	Well, if she's blatantly having unprotected sex, she has no business worrying every month that she might be pregnant. There are plenty of birth control methods out there. It's not like she doesn't know how babies are made. And quite frankly, if she's not able to raise a child right now, she's being very selfish to the baby who will likely be conceived. <br>  If she got her period, she is not pregnant...yet. But if she continues to have unsafe sex, it won't be long before she is.|`|brbKIa12aa	She needs to take a test. I came on my period once while I was pregnant. Being pregnant is the last thing she needs to be worried about...with all the stds. Tell you "friend" to make an appointment with the clinic ASAP and get the works (std testing, pregnancy test, etc.).|`|BhZmRJSBaa	you can have your period while you are pregnant.
dzyJw0cvaa	When i found out i was sixteen and pregnant, my parents were VERY angry, but looking back i know that i honestly could not have done it without their help.  I was emancipated and i married my boyfriend, though we divorced six years later because he was a complete asshole.  <br>  <br>  But thats beside the point.  Right now i know exactly what you are going through and I am so sorry you have to deal with this.  Your life is about to change DRASTICALLY.  Things are going to get rough, but if you stick it through you will be very happy and you will know and undertsand the joy and rewards of being a mother!<br>  <br>  First off, try to reach out to your parents and see if they will help support you for the time being.  You can apply for WIC which is a program that helps mothers get groceries and i think it even covers diapers and things now.  (Formula is EXPENSIVE and if you cannot breast feed, WIC is the best option for you to help get that formula paid for!)  Also, I live in MN and I have free health care called Minnesota Care.  you should be able to contact the state and try to find out what sorts of government benefits you can apply for.<br>  <br>  Although being a teen and pregnant is not all fun and games, the world has a way of making it easier for you, you just have to use your resources and find out what help you qualify for.  <br>  <br>  Finish high school, make that one of your number one priorities and just becuase you are having a baby doesnt mean you cant still go to college and get a great future going for you.<br>  <br>  Things are going to be alright.  Life throws curve balls, this is one of the biggest ones (I know, i've been there!) but it is surviveable and you will pull through just fine if you try hard enough.<br>  <br>  Remember, having a baby is a miracle no matter what the circumstances and its an event to be congratulated.  Good luck and I wish you the best in your future ahead!!!|`|79eRDIbXaa	Where are you from?<br>  Either way if you book a Doctors Appointment then they will be able to go over everything for you and give you the best places for help and advice where you live. Good Luck XxXx|`|r782jijgaa	Get a job with health benefits and look for housing  based on your monthly income from your job.|`|G9wEDvedaa	the best advise is tell your parents your pregnant then make a plan together of whats going to happen once the babys born|`|TGtgMu8eaa	Go to ur local clinic<br>  They should give u all ur infomation!<br>  Also<br>  tell someone!<br>  It can really help<br>  <br>  x|`|NPMKqJlMaa	u girls make me sick cant u wait till u get married ?? anyways its up to u now|`|AA12243665	I know what you are going through.  I was 16 when I got pregnant the first time as well.  I am now 30 and have a wonderful 13 year old.  Tell your family.  They may be upset and worried but I know that they will help any way they can and will always be there for you.  That is the best help you can ever ask for.  Also no matter how you feel about SRS help ask for it.  There are may different programs for single moms.  You can apply for WIC, food stamps, daycare money, medical cards, and cash assistance to help pay for bills.  Also try to find a job after you finish school.  That is also important.  I know with a new baby it is hard to finish school but that will help you out so much.  You don't have to settle for any job but there is so much pride to be had by saying that you can have both a job and a new baby and your don't have to rely only on governement assistance. Don't be ashamed because of it.  As long as you are trying your best to support yourself and your baby a little extra help is nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't listen to anyone on here like the person that said you make them sick because you are so young to get pregnant.  Well ya know what you are only human and if they never make a mistake in their life then there is something wrong with them.  Love that little baby with all that you are and all that you have and you will make it just fine.  Congradulations and good luck on your future.|`|BhZmRJSBaa	i got pregnant when i was 17. i had to sign up for medicaid. it is really nice. you dont have to pay for anything. and for housing all you need to do is look around your town and see what is available there.

Congrats on your bundle and Good luck =D|`|OPTDFRuzaa	if you took a test in mid jan then you may have ovulate a few weeks after that. you need to calculate your due date from your last period you need to remmeber how many days in your cycle for example 28 which would mean you ovulate 11 days after your period so just count the weeks from the till the middle of jan and see when you would have ovulated last thats when you concieved and 2 weeks after that is when your embro implanted itself.|`|orGvWwhBaa	Take a ClearBlue pregnancy test, as it not only tells you that you are pregnant, but how far along you approximately are.|`|cix2DEbbaa	You could try to use an online pregnancy predictor, mine came up 1 1/2 weeks early but i mean hey gives you an idea.

kiJUCYMcaa	it could harm the baby, also its not good to have too much x-rays done to anyone aswell|`|AA10186411	Because it is ionizing radiation.  It can cause birth defects, and even embryonic death because the cells in an embryo/fetus are dividing so rapidly.<br>  <br>  Of course, pregnant women can get x-rays if necessary.  Just it is preferred they have their abdomen shielded as a precaution.  Most diagnostic procedures do not have enough dose to cause any ill-effects.<br>  <br>  Whoever said it causes leukemia or skin cancer...is an idiot.  Yes, you can get that with over exposure, but thats for YOURSELF, not a fetus.|`|t5xnbgKkaa	There is a greatly increased risk of the child developing leukaemia if it has been subjected to x-rays in the womb. If, however there is a  real need for the mother to be given an x-ray then the doctors and parents weight risk to the child against the benefits to the mother before making a decision. The risk is greatly increased but the majority of babies do not suffer ill-effects.|`|n4I0EKa7aa	X-rays emit radiation that can be harmful to a baby if exposed to large amounts especially in the early stages of pregnancy.  That's why doctors and techs ask if a woman is pregnant prior to completing an x-ray.  It's not as bad as it sounds, but there's nothing wrong with being cautious.|`|wUMrDRe8aa	The radiation from the X-Ray, if exposed to the woman's stomach more than once, would increase the chances of the woman and the baby once born of having skin cancer.<br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Lisa.Rr x|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	Because the radiation can harm, if not kill the developing fetus.|`|AA11109431	According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, x-rays are generally safe during pregnancy, but there is quite a bit of controversy surrounding this issue. Studies have been conflicting, and therefore x-rays should only be done when the benefits outweigh the risks. X-rays can give your health care provider important and even life saving information about numerous medical conditions.<br>  <br>  Not all x-rays are the same, but most pose little exposure to the uterus and developing fetus. With dental x-rays there is hardly any exposure to any part of the body except the teeth<br>  <br>  X-ray examinations on the arms, legs, or chest do not expose your reproductive organs to the direct beam. However, x-rays of the torso, such as the abdomen, stomach, pelvis, lower back and kidneys, have a greater chance of exposure to the uterus. <br>  <br>  According to the American College of Radiology, no single diagnostic x-ray has a radiation dose significant enough to cause adverse effects in a developing embryo or fetus. Despite this, the American Academy of Family Physicians recommends against X-rays for pregnant women, unless medically essential for diagnosis and treatment of the mother.|`|mxmaLYxsaa	its is because standard x rays are dangerous to the baby.
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Yes its completely normal. Symptoms of pregnancy come and go, just about whenever they want. One week youll be completely nauseous, and the next you wont, and the week after that youll be nauseous again. <br>  So my advice is to SMILE and feel lucky that you arent the ladies that are bent over the toilet puking their guts out. Your baby is taking it easy on you. Congratulations on your pregnancy.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	its normal. morning sickness is different for every woman with every pregnancy. I didnt have any at all, but some women have it all 9 months BAD. be thankful it is gone for now because it may return.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	The little bit of morning sickness that I had, went away when we found out. It was like 2 weeks of sporadic bouts of nausea. We found out at 4 weeks and I feel fabulous.|`|9EgWyiNbaa	Every pregnancy is different..some women are never sick,some for only a short time and some women dont stop. My gf was sick from 1st week till the last month..her best friend was "Berty Bucket" who travelled everywhere with us..even to friends houses! It was also 24/7 sickness too and even smells set her off..she suffered greatly and all i could do was hold her hair out of the way. Our lovely little boy was worth it but we not having any more.|`|xkSuKSn8aa	Normally it doesn't even start until then, and lasts thru your first trimester.<br>  Have you seen your OB yet? Get an appointment and ask them to check your hormone levels.<br>  Everyone is different, and only an ultrasound and blood test will tell you for sure if everything is OK.|`|46cbd785e6475e81fd1cbbaa46a93a81aa	yes very normal.....it was the same for me....sick for 2 weeks straight.....it went away...again at 30 weeks it came back...doc says it is very normal....enjoy the time that ur not sick.....cause if it comes back it could be worse|`|FUy58eimaa	It's hard to say.  A lot of women experience severe morning sickness and some none at all.  If you're worried about the viability of your pregnancy, you should call your doctor.  They don't generally perform an ultrasound prior to 8-9 weeks, but they can check your hormone levels and make sure that they are increasing normally.|`|d91775dc0167078dadf8d8093e2a4445aa	i had morning sickness only once when i was preggo.  and she is very healthy.
hKJIDdVqaa	I am a lecturer.  I do not do grounding, timeouts, spankings etc.  I believe children need to know why not to do wrong, why they did wrong, and why they should not do wrong again.  I am more of a "What would Jesus do?" type of parent"|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I use positive reinforcement also on a daily basis.  I'll have to think about some creative examples and edit.......|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Asking them how they think they can resolve whatever issue they're having - Involving them in recognizing & understanding the problem, then figuring out how to make positive changes in their own lives.  <br>  <br>  For example - dealing with homework getting done.  Sure, I can keep nagging & they can whine about when I 'make them' do it.  Or, I can let them know that I am unhappy having to be the 'bad guy' making them do something that is in their best interest, then ask them to figure out when they're going to do it and help them set reminders & rewards for themselves.|`|j2mRop0laa	Des, I love that! I'm gonna have to start using that tonight at the dinner table.<br>  <br>  I can't think of anything *creative* to offer, really.<br>  <br>  I redirect a lot. If things start to get rowdy I jump in and tickle or interrupt with a knock knock joke etc. I would rather redirect before it gets bad (with sibling bickering and such).|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i dont know about discipline per say but i do, do some off the wall things sometimes to get behavior changed.  In the car if its a cranky mood or whining - i will "eat her toes"  hear me out -  reach back and try and grab her toes and tell her i'm eating them and they taste like chicken.  it never fails.  she'll get in the game and "steal" my toes but then tells me mine are yucky.  ewww.  it always helps lighten the mood.<br>  in the store, if they are whining, i will start whining.  waaa waaaa - thats what is takes to get them to tell me to stop doing that mommy.  viola whining is done.<br>  thats the kind of stuff i do.  and i do even weirder.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit - des its those pesky words and their actual dictionary definition - as in feminist.  remember the uproar?|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I recently have gone back to work full time, and therefore have less time to keep the house as clean as I'd like.  And, I have to be fair and tell the truth - I have allowed my kids to become a little lazy while I was at home all the time because I did pretty much every thing.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the one thing the kids are REALLY bad about is leaving their clothes on the bathroom floor.  We only have one bathroom, so this bothers me ALOT.  I explained to them that I am not the family maid, and that it is their responsibility to pick up their stuff.  After a few days of getting no where, I calmly walked into their bedrooms with my hand out.  They looked at me like I was crazy, and asked what I was doing.  I instructed them to to each put a quarter (25 cents, not 1/4 of) their allowance money into my hand.  They asked why, and I informed them that since they want to treat me like a maid, they will pay me like they would have to pay any other maid.  After a couple of times of that, they got the hint.  My kids are very big on saving money, so for me to hit them in the pocketbook was the best thing I could have done.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	ahh, ingenius idea, ill have to steal, err, borrow it someday<br>  i don't really have anything special, :(, unless you count chore charts, and signed contracts that prohibit breaking the rules (i wonder how much of a lawyer influence they have), nope, nothing really|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	wow des, that's awesome. I'll have to try that when Jacob is older.|`|T864ejaiaa	what ever works for you is good.|`|haabfMtkaa	I am very big on choice and consequences. I believe that this is what life is about your choices and the consequences that come along with them so if you chose to misbehave then you have to deal with the consequences for example you are choosing to get up from the table then you are choosing not to have dessert. I make this very clear to my children from the youngest age they can understand. I believe that my kids need to learn that the choice"s they make in life they have to stick by there no going back. Example #2 you can chose to throw a fit right now and that is fine but then your choosing to not play on the computer the rest of the day.. I believe that this holds them responsible for there actions at a very young age and it is a trait that I hope will make them in to responsible adults.|`|nfzQkvqraa	Ha. Some of your answers are funny.  I would consider that creative discipline.  That's the kind of thing I like to do with my children, and I may try it next time we're out.<br>  <br>  If my son doesn't want to eat his vegetables I don't start yelling at him at telling him he'll sit there until it's finished.  We have what we call "green bean races."  You aren't racing against each other.  Just yourself.  All I have to do is say the words and the veggies are gone.<br>  <br>  When my kids are fussy in the car we play the word association game.  They have to start with whatever offense they were just commiting. (for example whining) and then we'll take turns saying what comes to mind first based on what the person before us had said.<br>  <br>  I like to redirect what my children are doing.  I like to make their responsibilites as fun as possible (music while doing chores)  At the end of the day I rarely finding myself actually punishing my children.  We have talks a lot.  They know right from wrong.  <br>  <br>  Of course these things don't always work.  When I have to discipline there are many ways I do it.  If they won't pick up after themselves I'll take whatever toys they wouldn't clean up and put them in a bag for a week.  If they won't share, nobody gets it. <br>  <br>   If my 7 year old does something that is worth punishment I will often have her write down what she did wrong, why she did it, what she should have done instead, and why her choice wasn't the best one.  It makes her think and that's what's important to me.|`|prqrQcd1aa	For my oldest who has behavioral problems we use a "point system" much like you use for your children. Only things are earned or taken away, so i guess that doesn't count! My daughter uses this in school and at home as well. She has to earn so many points to get recess, and has to earn so many points to be able to watch tv at home. <br>  I don't know if this would be condsidered as "discipline" or not, but we do play who can clean their room the fastest.. My 7 year old usually wins (though a couple times my 3 year old has!)...mom is always last LOL. There is no reward for this other than making shure that rooms are clean and there is responsiblity being taught!|`|s6emVQleaa	Are you reading my mind, I was thinking about this very thing yesterday.  The funniest punishment I've ever seen was for little boys I used to babysit.  They lived on a dairy and they decided it would be fun to hide from me on it, for almost an hour.  Needless to say I was frantic by the time they appeared.  So, when their dad got home and I explained it all he went through talking about it with them and had them apologize and so forth.  The great part was when we gave them their allowance for the week- and then made them give it to me.  Talk about hitting them where it hurt (and it wasn't even the end to their punishment), and it still cracks me up 15 years later.|`|yo9XNz61aa	That is very creative and also very good that you dont offer a reward for doing something that your kids should know to do anyways...however...im curious...does it not take time out of enjoying dinner for you when you are constantly writing down tallies?  My daughter is a baby so shes not old enough to be disciplined but im glad you asked this b/c im always curious about ways ppl discipline their children...I know someone who closes the toilet seat and puts their child on it for time out b/c sending them to thier room is too fun...I also know someone who has their child sit on their bed vs the childs bed b/c theres nothing for them to do on the bed!|`|xApAWlshaa	well a good disciplinary is just talking and taking the time to explain and also learning to be passive and practice self restraint
aEpPt9koaa	Your not a terrible mother! Never say that!  Babies/children fall and bump their heads, its just a part of life.  Let me tell you some of my stories....  When my daughter was four months old me and her father were going out to eat for my birthday.  I put her in her carseat but I didnt buckle her, I was going to do that once we got in the car.  Well her father thought she was buckled and he picked up the seat she tilted it forward to place it in our truck.... Our daughter slipped out the seat and fell onto the CONCRETE driveway!!! We felt HORRIBLE!  We rushed her to the hospital and both of us cried the whole way to the children's hospital.  We got her checked out and she was perfectly fine.<br>  <br>  When she was about 18 months.  We were upstairs and I needed to run down to the landing to grab her bag of new clothes that I left sitting there.  I turned for what seemed like a half second and when I turned around she was stepping down to follow me.  I couldnt move fast enough, next thing I know she was falling down the steps. Again I took her to the emergency room and her worse injury was bloody lip.  Other than that she was perfectly fine.<br>  <br>   And last week! She is now 2 and she was running through the family room chasing our dog when she tripped over her own feet and went flying through the air and hit her head on the leg of the coffee table.  Her worse injury... a bruise that is already starting to fade.  So your eight month old falling a few feet off the bed doesnt even compare to the falls my daughter has had, lol. Children are going to fall and get bumps and bruises no matter how careful you think you are being but most of the time they walk away with nothing more than a scratch.  Children are tougher than we think.  Your doing a great job mom!  Never ever think you are being a bad mother just because your child gets injured because that's just not the case.  I hope this helped.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Well if that makes you terrible then we should just all start a terrible mom club! I'm sure there will be more falls where that came from. The first time my son ever fell he was in his pool. He was sitting up and went to crawl, and hit his face on a concrete step... I cried, probably more then he did, and rushed him to the ER because I thought his nose was broke! Needless to say he was absolutely fine, but I still cried about it for a while after that, I was sitting on the step that he hit his face on, along with my sister in law, and we both felt really horrible that we didn't prevent it. Accidents happen, and eventually falls will be a daily thing! Now when my son falls off of something I say "brush it off" and he wiggles and smiles, it's so funny! Your not a terrible mom. Terrible moms push their kids off of the bed!|`|dgRTkccBaa	You're not a terrible mother, these things happen. It will be the first of many falls, and it only gets worse as they get older.  My two year old was walking down our walkway yesterday and just fell over right next to me.  Her head hit the cement and made that horrible 'clunk' sound.  She wasn't running or anything, she just fell over. She wasn't hurt, but I still felt horrible that I didn't catch her, but my husband reminded me that there was no way I could know she was going to just fall over like that.<br>  We do the best we can, but kids are going to fall and sometimes they're even going to get hurt with cuts and even broken bones, we just have to do our best to keep them safe and know that unfortunately accidents do happen.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You get used to it.<br>  <br>  My sons have fallen more times than I could count, probably more times than I could count just this last month alone.  They fall with me right beside them, they fall with me out of the room.  I was playing with both and they were both within arms reach and my 3 year old pushed the 15 month old over and he hit his head hard, I couldn't catch him it happened in a blink.<br>  <br>  My son broke his tooth in half falling and hitting his mouth on my knee!<br>  <br>  These things happen, kids fall.  You can't keep them safe at all times, and falling is how they learn.|`|z8YGEk0qaa	You're not a terrible mother...it was an accident and accidents do happen. I'm glad he seems okay but keep an eye on him just in case. Now you know just to be more careful next time becasue he is more mobile than you thought. Don't beat yourself up too bad.|`|crspNObZaa	I had my son strapped to the changing table, i turned to answer my phone (just turned didnt even step away) and BAM it happens, your not a bad mom, and baby is fine.|`|C6LNxOeSaa	Awe, babies are always going to fall. Accidents happen. Don't beat yourself up! It doesn't mean your a bad mommy, my baby fell off the bed at 1 week, I started crying. But he was okay. (:|`|dK2Zv21Daa	Because I  succeed doesn't mean that I've never failed In order to succeed I must fail   He  has to fall several times "just like you did" if he's going to learn the art of walking . He  will fall, bite his tongue  may be break a bone have a cavity make you laugh and for sure  you will cry over this  child.  What you've just learned is that we must be vigilant at all times protect the environment and wish for the best, but save your tears for  the teen years|`|n0WnEIopaa	I would say that happens to a good percentage of mom's/babies. <br>  <br>  Accidents happen, you didn't mean it, and there wasn't anything you could have thought to do differently at the time, that's why they are called accidents. <br>  <br>  Try to forgive yourself, so your little one doesn't pick up on you being so upset about it. <br>  <br>  Move on, enjoy rest of the day and make it a happy one for your babe. <br>  <br>  Also the fact you are so worried just proves you are a great mom, a "terrible mother" wouldn't care.|`|grKtTRYtaa	Lighten up.<br>  My 6 week old daughter was lying on a bed;  I didn't know that she could roll over.  She did and hit the floor. I was 2 ft. away.  I still remember it now after almost 40 years.<br>  She graduated as valedictorian of her high school class, state band, even a model.  She has 2 degrees and 2 perfectly healthy kids now.<br>  I have told her about the incident several times.  I didn't consider myself terrible,  but I kept very close to my 2 children afterwards.  They both grew up fine.|`|zQWNb6neaa	Aww, you are not a terrible Mother! Trust me- we have all been there! My son is a walking disaster. He is only three years old and has already had two stitches, two surgical staples, a wrist injury resulting in a cast at only 18 months old, a slight concussion, and multiple bumps and bruises. My nerves have been completely shot to the point were I now just shake my head and tend to the newest injury. Kids get hurt, try as we might to protect them fully. Rest easy mom, and get in a few extra cuddles today.
kPl8TTzNaa	Sounds trendy and childish, similar to other trendy names that are popular right now like Kaylie and Kylie. It will not age well. Also I dislike the spelling.

uLdeIhHqaa	my daughter was 6.5 months old when I first took her swimming- I just put her feet in the water and then when I got in I just held her really close to me and stayed in the shallow end. SHE LOVED IT!!!!!!|`|PNPg9Ytkaa	Hes old enough... We start swim lessons at 6 weeks old (which I am taking my baby this saturday for the first time at 6 weeks) I have been a competitive swimmer for many years and 3 months is def old enough just make sure not to have them for more than an hour... I would say probably no more than 30 min for his age and the chlorine is fine just take a bath and use some lotion after (because it tends to dry the skin) have fun!! swimming is great for babies|`|FyAHNpQbaa	i took my son swimming when he was about 2 months old. a friend of mine was not allowed to bring her baby into the pool at a different place at the same age b/c they said he was too young.<br>  i don't think there's anything wrong with it, b/c i've seen those baby survival swimming classes (where they teach babies to roll onto their backs and float) being done in chlorinated pools|`|yKS2UI87aa	My son was born in the summer and I had a little 3 ring pool I used and he loved it. Mind you I never put him under water. (some people do) It would be safe in a chlorinated pool as well just remember to rinse him off with regular water afterwards. Swim diapers are awesome but harder to get off than put on cuz there wet. My son and I had "swim lessons" at about 14 months as well, they really just got him used to the water but he loooooves it.|`|hVVALFAPaa	First child - splashing in the backyard at 8 months; pool - 2 years (there wasn't a REAL pool that we could use until then)<br>  <br>  Second child - backyard - 7 months; pool 18 months<br>  <br>  Third child - real pool - 3 months, but just his feet and legs. He LOVED it! It was a heated pool. By the time he was a year, he was a great swimmer.<br>  <br>  Fourth child - real pool - 6 months.<br>  <br>  Some pools do not like children that young near the pool because of the diaper situation. Also, with all of my kids, I made sure they bathed/showered as soon as we got out.|`|LhV8D2Xeaa	it would be fine. just slowly let him go into the water and use plenty of sunscreen.  and the chlorine is fine i took my son in a pool about 3-4 months and he was perfectly fine didnt even rinse him off.|`|1SpbRdPEaa	well if he is that young then i would say wait until he is a little older like around 3-4years old. and no chlorine wouldn't  be bad for his skin.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	6 months.|`|29I3YjjPaa	I took my son at 6 months, but only cuz he was born in the cold, it should be fine just remember they can't handle the sun or heat like we can and also remember to bath them after cuz the chlorine, i dunno where u are but its definitely not warm enough here remember the water needs to be at least 70 before you should put your baby in it!|`|4dXI8kuVaa	If you're worried about chlorine--even though i don't think it is a problem because if it's fine for us then shouldn't it be fine for him?--then go buy a cheap kiddie pool at Wal-mart and fill it with the water hose, and get in the pool with him. It would be super fun with water toys.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	My son was born in February and went swimming that summer, so around 5 months. My daughter was born in May and she was in the pool with us that summer so around 2-3 months.  Each were fine.  Keep the baby out of the sun as much as possible and after each time in the pool just make sure to bathe him to get the extra chlorine off.  Good Luck|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	It's not too young.  Make sure you rinse and wash well after you go in the pool and he will be fine.  I took my daughter in at 4 months.  We have a salt water pool so no chemicals and environmentally friendly too.|`|tapFZBowaa	I actually teach swimming and I do not take anyone under 6 months in class, but it really depends on your baby.  My 6 month olds and their moms have a great time in class--it is 30 minutes long, and as far as chlorine, etc. I would check out your local health department and ask if there have been any complaints, and you can check the log at the pool (they should test every 4 hours) for chemcial records and see if it is reading high or low before you enter the water.|`|dDVAUA9saa	I waited until the recommended age of 6 months because I am paranoid about stuff like that.  I didn't want to expose my daughter to chlorine earlier than that.  I have a friend though, who has been taking her 5 month old swimming for at least two months.  If it's an indoor pool and heated, it's warm enough.  If it's not heated, he might not like it.<br>  Just make sure you put a swim diaper on him.  And give him a bath after, the chlorine can make their skin dry and itchy.|`|FTFd3AQAaa	well my son was about a year... i hadn't intended to wait that long it just happened... one thing to be considering is that most sun screens say they are not for use on children under 6 months i beleieve, now if you are looking at an indoor pool no problem but if it a pool outside he really shouldn't spend time in the sun without l<br>  sun screen... so it would be up to you if you heed the warning or not|`|HXfHkoSHaa	It's fine, but they can't stay in the water for longer than 1 hour before they're a year.  Before this, their  little bodies can get too cold because they can't regulate body temp.<br>  <br>  I was told this by a fitness instructor at my gym where there are mom & baby water aerobics classes.

zwctZ812aa	YES!!!! The bouncer was my lifesaver the first 3 months!! My son hated his swing, but would sit contently in his bouncer for short periods of time and loved to nap in it.  I take it in the bathroom while I shower, the kitchen while I cook, the backyard while I rake leaves, and it is so easy to put in the car to take places so you can set baby down. Not all babies like swings, so bouncers are an inexpensive back up. Get one with the vibrating feature.  We have a fischer price and it's great.  It was $26.99  Here's the link <a href="http://www.target.com/Fisher-Price-Soothe-n-Play-Bouncer/dp/B001HTNN3E/qid=1236193643/ref=br_1_31/187-3100573-8275260?ie=UTF8&node=1041928&frombrowse=1&pricerange=&index=tgt-mf-mv&field-browse=1041928&rank=pmrank&rh=&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Fisher-Price-Sooth...</a> (ours is a different print but has been discontinued.)|`|HXfHkoSHaa	My son is very active, and not nearly as happy in the swing as the bouncer.  Although he feels it's his job to be held all the time, and doesn't want the bouncer for more than 10 minutes.  I started putting him in the bouncer at 2 months.  He was already steady on his feet by then and always wanted to stand.<br>  <br>  ETA:  maybe I'm a little confused.  What I refer to as a bouncer is the Jumperoo thing where the baby bounces or jumps.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	absolutely!  They're so handy to have.  I used to put one in the bathroom, while I showered.  Or I had one in the kitchen while I cooked.  My husband would take it outside and sit with our son -- Or have him in a bouncy seat, next to him, while he worked.  Some babies get bored with the swings, and like a change of scenery.  They're also easier to bring with you than a swing is.  (Although we looooved our swing too!!)<br>  <br>  I vote yes, definitely!  If you don't want to spend the money, look at ebay, second hand stores, or yard sales!|`|NI8D46J0aa	Honestly, I never really used mine very often. I think the swing is probably enough.  See if anyone you know has one you can borrow or if they have  a secondhand mother's store near you that may have one cheaper. Good luck!|`|QOvUS6xVaa	i uses mine to place my son in the sun shine for jaundice, and to feed him when he spit up tomuch ,, he used it for a good 6 months|`|vjK8ZT20aa	Oh heavens yes!!! We have a swing which our two month  old has enjoyed since birth but the bouncer has also been a life saver.  When we first brought her home she wouldn't sleep in her bed, she would only sleep in her bouncer with the vibrations on.  A bouncer is great because it is easily moved around.  You can put it in the middle of the kitchen table while you cook dinner, put it in the bathroom while you shower, I mean you can virtually keep your baby beside you all of the time in it.|`|tx8OTfFUaa	I think YES!!  We have a Sweet Peace swing (I swear it's the cadillac of swings) and our son liked it when he was 2 months and younger, but we got him a baby exer-saucer and he just flourished...it has lots of toys on it and sound making things.  We just borrowed a bouncer that lets  him jump up and down, it's great!!  He has the seat bouncer as well, but we only use that to let him hold onto his bottle.  <br>  <br>  Be careful about keeping them in the bouncer (jumping up and down) as he needs more tummy time than anything else!|`|FyAHNpQbaa	i had a jolly jumper on a stand for my first son. he loved it, but it was so hard to get him in and out of it. my second son had a horse jumper from toys'r us and he loved it, and it was easy to put him in and take him out.<br>  i also had a swing, exersaucer, and bouncy/vibrating chair for my second son. sometimes he'd get tired and fussy of a few of them for days and the only way to calm him down was to put him in the jumper or another one. <br>  i think it was well worth the money<br>  <br>  you won't need a jumper until your baby is about 4 months old|`|bd22ca32eb55bc06eaa923b22bd0e54aaa	I have one but only because it's a swing that the seat comes off and is a bouncer. It's nice because I can just take off the seat if I need to get a shower or something. He doesn't use it much though. I wouldn't get one if you already have a swing.|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	Make sure you read the age limit first for safety as I'm not sure what it is, cannot recall....but my son LOVED and I mean LOVED his "Johnny Jump Up."  He liked it a lotttt better than his swing.  He was soooo adorable to watch too!  Good luck.<br>  <br>  So for us, YES it was totally worth spending the money.  It's great exercise for them too!|`|VCCKfT3taa	Yes! You might not need it for the first month or two, at those times a good infant swing is enough. But when they get older it can be invaluable.<br>  <br>  If you find out you don't need it, just give it another needy mother or sell it in the pennysaver.|`|cZrbAiUIaa	Well I don't have a kid, but I babysit a 10 month old everyday, and she loves her bouncer. If she gets antsy, I'll put her in there and she loves it.|`|LhV8D2Xeaa	no they cant use a bouncer tell about 5 months.|`|bwlDJdtdaa	I have a daughter and splashed out, let her have everything,  she used her bouncer for about half an hour and then we ended up giving it to a friend|`|AA11099527	I had one and never used it. They are fine with just a swing.|`|njgHAiBiaa	Just a message to browneyes - you should never put a bouncer seat on a table.
IRZ4czGPaa	go to wallgreens or any pharmacy and get soothies.. theyre nipple gel pads they work great!|`|ld14iRCeaa	babies r us sells several product lines dedicated to helping out moms in that area. there are creams that help a lot. you can also find it in baby sections of meijers. cvs, walgreens...etc. you may have to look a little harder at those places, but its there. or try online. there are many brands to be found that could help you in your situation:) good luck.|`|IyWnHqPuaa	They make cream for sore nipples while breastfeeding it also works on tender nipples while pregnant (ive used it while pregnant) you can find it in the baby ailse.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	you dont want to try ice or heat? it helps.. or wrap a tenser bandage around so they are snugged up.|`|cRoIhjNzaa	buy tendercare lanolin by medela it worked for me....you could probably get it at babiesrus.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I don't have pain nearly like that, but they are very tender to the touch. I've told my hubby that they are off limits for now because they are too sore! lol|`|8oAlBL91aa	Tylenol is perfectly safe to take during pregnancy your doctor told you you could take it why won't you? So if you have a head ache your just going to let it pound that sucks.

I like Nicole Madelyn as well, both are pretty names. I definitely would not use Anna Nicole, many would associate this with Anna Nicole Smith.

Maybe "water babies" but there may be confusion as it is also a suncreen and dolls name|`|PNPg9Ytkaa	I started one several years back before I moved and I focused on babies only (the demand was so high and no one was willing to teach babies) and I named mine Water Babies... not too cute or unique lol but that was it...

Though right now there are alot of hiring freezes and probably for another year or so till companies know if this stimulus package will make it or fail, hiring freezes will remain! I don't think right now is the time to move. As far as schools, I'm not a fan of public, so my kids are going to private, it's actually not that high in cost.
xApAWlshaa	She thanks you.because probably if she took the big career she may have not gotten her life together it wouldve just got worse.so thanks to you you helped her you did something good.and just my opinion money.is just paper/regardless of what career you have it will not bring you happiness ever.and you both have your lives your together and you both love eachother so yes shes thanking you|`|eu6UQElYaa	It's not necessarily abnormal for a mother to feel that way SOMETIMES.   But to feel that way often or constantly sounds like a problem.   And for her to tell you that once you and your sister are out of her way she can do what she really wants with life sounds just plain wrong.   <br>  <br>  I had my daughter at 21, unplanned and unmarried at the time (married her father a few months later).  My son was more planned than my daughter (we weren't trying but we weren't not trying either).   And I've sometimes wondered what I would be doing if I didn't have kids but honestly I wouldn't trade my life in for anything.   I'm happy being a mother.   So I don't think it's just because one of you was planned and the other wasn't. Maybe she's just depressed or bored with her life or has low self esteem or something.|`|AA11785285	Often in our society, and unplanned pregnancy is carried to term because of guilt....<br>    " I don't believe in abortion."---A fundamentalistic christian notion, foisted on the poorest in our society.  <br>  <br>  But what then occurs is that tho the mother will bond to the baby, the mother begins to lose interest as soon as the kid reaches grade 6, and is pretty detached by the time the kid is in grade 8.... the beginning of teen age years.<br>  <br>  It is at this point that the kid pretty much feels left out of life...rather like you do.<br>  <br>  And women who have babies out of a marriage, or a solid relationship, soon find that they are dateless, and partnerless..... unless the guy just wants a booty call.  Few men will commit to raise her children...... <br>  <br>  35% of white kids now live with just mom, and 65% of black ones do.  Children of other men are baggage.  It is not natural for another man to raise  some one else's kids.<br>  <br>  And as well, few women wish to raise another woman's children, when the father has full custody.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, when women have unprotected  sex, they really don't realize the full consequences of a pregnancy carried to term.....2 decades of her life, and $250.000 just to get the kid to age 18.  So, hon, I'd say that is one bunch of stuff to be resentful for.  And this is likely where your mom's head is.<br>  <br>  She  is likely pushing age  40 with a short stick (middle age) and has seen the best years of her life gone in raising babies she never truly planned for, nor fully understood how dedicated a job it truly is.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest to you to not repeat this error. <br>  <br>   Have no babies out of a solid relationship, and none before you are 25, and none until you have that education...as my mama said: <br>  <br>  "Your education and your children are forever.... husbands, lovers and promises are not."<br>  <br>  I'd say your mom learned this the hard way.  And is realizing there might have been a better life for her, had she stayed in school.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Your mother needs to step up to the plate and act like a parent instead of running all over the world trying to fix other people's problems.  She needs to focus on herself FIRST!  <br>  No child is planned or unplanned; once you have sex, then you accept the responsibility no matter if you're married or not.<br>  YOU can not make things better with her - SHE must be the one to accept her actions and then come to you and apologize.  If she can't then don't worry about it so much.  One day, hopefully, she will wake up and realize her mistakes.  Good luck!|`|547Ln6rNaa	Look, she's not had the life she wanted and she's blaming people, you're close enough to blame, that's all. If she's been talking about going to go with the church medical service she's probably never going to do it, she'll probably blame your step-dad for her not going once you kids are out of the picture. The perpetual martyr. She should act like a Christian and stop putting her failure on her kid as guilt.<br>  <br>  Listen, the only way you can make things better is to either: take it all in your stride - you're not going to fix her, you have to accept her as she is and accept that she says mean things to you, OR don't accept her, and leave it at one or two visits a year.<br>  <br>  She's the parent but she can't act like one. I'd die in a heartbeat for my child, my job is to protect him, he didn't ask to be here, I wanted him here, he had no say in it. It's my lifelong duty to protect and love him.|`|T52u1DVXaa	I wouldn't know how normal this is.  I know neither of my children were planned.  But I'd never insult them.  Or tell them.  I find it wrong to tell a child they're an accident.<br>  <br>  Obviously your mother has mixed feelings.  I would think the being thankful you straightened out her life would outweigh the "I didn't get the job or life I wanted" but if she's depressed that would probably come out more.  With her being depressed I wouldn't take it to heart but that's a bit hard to do.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	As an unplanned baby, I believe my parents wouldn't trade me for the world. My sister, who was planned, also seemed as if she was somewhat neglected once she started school. I think that often baby # 2 is because parents see their first one growing up, and miss the baby that they're never going to see again. <br>  <br>  I often blamed myself, as did my parents for them staying "together". Though now that all the kids are grown, they seem to be reconnecting. <br>  <br>  Think of it this way though. You didn't ruin her life, you changed it. If it weren't for you, it'd probably be someone else, or she could be dead, she can't honestly say that you ruined her life, because who knows where she would have ended up other wise. <br>  <br>  As an unexpected parent, I sometimes wonder what I would be doing if I didn't have my daughter. I'd like to think that I would have finished school, started a career, and bought a house etc... In reality, I'd probably kept on the same track I was on... that long road to nowhere, occasionally interrupted by some bad decisions and a little too much partying. <br>  <br>  If it weren't for the unplanned aspect of it, I don't think I ever would have chosen to have kids. But I love my daughter more than life itself, and wouldn't trade her for the world. It's hard to think about life with out her, and really, all roads lead to her. I both love and hate watching her grow up, because I'm so proud of everything she is accomplishing, but as she grows I miss the little things, that stop happening. She's still very young, but she's changed so much in our short time together. <br>  <br>  At the same time though... I'll definitely be traveling once my responsibilities turn to me again. It's tough putting someone else before yourself constantly... especially when things are tight. But it's well worth every minute.<br>  <br>  ADDED: To make things better, treat her to something special, a day at the spa or whatever, and then sincerely thank her for giving you life, and giving up her way of life. Tell her that you hope that, someday, you can be half the mom that she is. Or something along those lines, whatever applies to your situation.|`|MYU46ap5aa	I know how your Mom feels.  She's just depressed.  She loves you and she thanks you for being born and coming into her life because you helped her to focus and get her life together.  Trust me she loves you.  <br>  <br>  And yes, she probably has baby syndrome.  I know I love babies because they're sweet, precious, and don't talk back.  I guess because they always need you and look at you with a loving look in their eyes.  Doesn't mean she loves you any less now.<br>  <br>  Your mother seems to admire your sister's outgoing personality because it's something she never had.  <br>  <br>  Your mother seems to want to explore life now and find herself and make herself happy so she won't be so depressed.  I think it's just something she has to work out by herself.  Try not to worry so much.<br>  <br>  Just try to call her at least once a week and tell her that you love her and are just checking up on her to make sure she's okay.  It will get better.<br>  <br>  Damn, I hope my girls don't feel like this about me when they get older.|`|iMxDPtWbaa	I would just stay out of it. The more you try to connect with your mom the more she will rebel and say you ruined her life. I know, whether you did or didn't, that it is not right to tell you that you did. Maybe you should tell her how you feel able everything. Since she is your mother maybe you should just talk to her and tell her everything that you have been feeling.
MUVdG9n1aa	Are you washing at home? Check out the website www.diaperco.com. It specifies how to wash the diapers and how many you will need.|`|yB5go5wbaa	I have 25 cloth diapers that are all in ones.  it usually lasts about 3 days.  you don't need as many covers because they don't poop on the covers...maybe about 4 or 5 of those.  Kudos for cloth diapering!|`|AA11903503	I wash at home and I have 12 pocket diapers and 6 AIO's that I use right now (have about 8 others that I have not opened yet). I wash every other day with the 18 I use. There was a time when I used gDiapers as well, and I only used 2 or 3 covers a day, i just wiped them out after each use.<br>  Good luck to you!
YP1DXbBDaa	With a newborn, you can figure about 12 diaper changes a day plus a couple of extras for the times when you put the diaper on, reach for the cover and it's wet before you put the cover on.   I like having at least six or eight covers in the newborn size-that accounts for time to dry out between wet ones and a couple of poop on covers during the day with enough to get you through til you do laundry.  So you may want to think about 15 for one day of diapering if you want to wash every day-keep in mind that this does slow down eventually, so you won't be changing diapers every two hours forever, and you may want to think about some other diapers that are better at holding overnight wet-we like pocket diapers here (Wonderroos in particular for overnight, Fuzzi Bunz for naps.) <br>  <br>  When you say "traveling" do you mean "out of the house running errands in the afternoon" or "away from the house for a week?"  I found that it was easier to cloth diaper all the time unless we were gone for extended periods of time-long enough that I'd have to wash the diapers away from home in someone else's washing machine and with different water and detergent and all that...so for example, when we traveled to visit family last winter, we used disposable diapers while we were traveling, but when I go out to the mall or a play date, we use cloth diapers.  So the advice I gave above assumes that you're doing the same thing that I am-using cloth unless you're away from home for days and days.   <br>  <br>  We did diaper laundry every other day with a newborn and every third day with an older baby who uses fewer diapers.  If you wanted to wash every day, you could probably get away with about 15 diapers and three to four covers.  When we've moved up in sizes we've also found that fewer covers  were fine...it's the messy newborn poop that tends to run more and require a few more covers.<br>  <br>  Good luck-we're very happy to cloth diaper and I can't imagine going to disposables full time.|`|d5479b73829d5fa0818d9eec2850a058aa	I have about 4 dozen cloth diapers and nine covers.  You wont need so many if your looking after baby at home (I had to get more for my tot to go to nursery).  I should imagine 2 -3 dozen should be plenty.  I used prefold nappies with my last 2 babies and I found them really good because you dont have to replace them everytime baby grows.  I only used 2 sizes and now my tots using the bigger size I still use the small ones as a booster pad.  Also I found that prefold nappies dry much faster than other shaped nappies.<br>  <br>  All the best with the new baby.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I would say for a newborn about 3 dozen is good.  I haven't tried the Kissaluvs yet, but I did find a newborn fitted by Swaddlebees that I like.  I currently use their 8-35 lb fitted; it's soft organic cotton velour, and it's GREAT!!<br>  I also enjoy the Baby Beehinds bamboo one size fitteds, and am ordering their hemp version as well!<br>  For covers, 4 should be okay, since you don't need to wash them each diaper change.  Once they smell like pee or are pooped on, go ahead and switch out.  <br>  I have Thirsties PUL covers and one Baby Beehind wool cover (SO nice!).  I like them both a lot!
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Sugar is a powerful pain reliever, particularly in babies.<br>  The main ingredient in teething tablets is sugar (lactose)<br>  <br>  So yes they work but not any better than a 1/4 tsp of table sugar.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&action=detail&ref=1806" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&a...</a><br>  We know that even a 12 percent solution of sugar can be a powerful drug, relieving measurable pain by half during a circumcision. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy#Dilution_and_succussion" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy#...</a><br>  In producing treatments for diseases, homeopaths use a process called "dynamisation" or "potentisation" whereby the remedy is diluted with alcohol or distilled water and then vigorously shaken by ten hard strikes against an elastic body in a process called "succussion". While Hehnemann advocated remedies which present symptoms similar to those of the disease he believed concentrated doses would only intensify the symptoms and exacerbate the condition, hence the dilution of the remedies. During the process of potentisation, homeopaths believe that the vital energy of the diluted substance is activated and its energy released by vigorous shaking of the substance. For this purpose, Hahnemann had a saddle maker construct a special wooden striking board covered in leather on one side and stuffed with horsehair.[66][67] Insoluble solids, such as quartz and oyster shell, are diluted by grinding them with lactose (trituration).<br>  <br>  Three potency scales are in regular use in homeopathy. Hahnemann created the centesimal or "C scale", diluting a substance by a factor of 100 at each stage. The centesimal scale was favored by Hahnemann for most of his life. A 2C dilution requires a substance to be diluted to one part in one hundred, and then some of that diluted solution diluted by a further factor of one hundred. This works out to one part of the original solution mixed into 9,999 parts (100 × 100 ?1) of the diluent.[68] A 6C dilution repeats this process six times, ending up with the original material diluted by a factor of 100-6=10-12. Higher dilutions follow the same pattern. In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is described as having a higher potency, and more dilute substances are considered by homeopaths to be stronger and deeper-acting remedies.[69] The end product is often so diluted that it is indistinguishable from the dilutant (pure water, sugar or alcohol).[2][70][71]<br>  X Scale  C Scale  Ratio  Note<br>  1X  —  1:10  described as low potency<br>  2X  1C  1:100  called higher potency than 1X by homeopaths<br>  6X  3C  10-6  <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Dilution debate<br>  <br>  Critics and advocates of homeopathy alike commonly attempt to illustrate the dilutions involved in homeopathy with metaphors.[77] Hahnemann is reported to have joked that a suitable procedure to deal with an epidemic would be to empty a bottle of poison into Lake Geneva, if it could be succussed 60 times.[78][79][80] Another example given by a critic of homeopathy states that a 12C solution is equivalent to a "pinch of salt in both the North and South Atlantic Oceans",[78][79] which is approximately correct.[81] One third of a drop of some original substance diluted into all the water on earth would produce a remedy with a concentration of about 13C.[82][83][77]<br>  <br>  Not all homeopaths advocate extremely high dilutions. Many of the early homeopaths were originally doctors and generally tended to use lower dilutions such as "3X" or "6X", rarely going beyond "12X". The split between lower and higher dilutions followed ideological lines with the former stressing pathology and a strong link to conventional medicine, while the latter emphasised vital force, miasms and a spiritual interpretation of disease.[84][85] Some products with such relatively lower dilutions continue to be sold, but like their counterparts, they have not been conclusively demonstrated to have any effect beyond the placebo.[86] [87]<br>  <br>  The BBC's Horizon and ABC's 20/20 broadcast programs described scientific testing of homeopathic dilutions[clarification needed] that were unable to differentiate these dilutions from water.[67][88]|`|pXSKSS3daa	I've always heard good things about them so, last week, I went and purchased some since my son is getting a molar in. I'm not sure if it's the fact that he wouldn't let me put them underneath his tongue(I even tried diluting them with a teaspoon of water as directed on the bottle) or if they just didn't affect him him. Either way I didn't notice a significant difference in his temperament.<br>  <br>  ETA: Lol, yeah Elyse's Mommy, I also just tried putting them in his mouth after he fought me about the tongue and still no change.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	YES.<br>  Those things worked wonders for both my children.<br>  Just a warning though, keep an eye on how many you are actually using. Watch for changes in the color of you babies tongue. <br>  If used following the directions they will allow your baby to have relief. And yes, I put one on my tongue to see how numb it makes you....it works!|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	I'm not sure they did anything but my daughter liked eating them.  Noah's Mommy - no need to put under the tongue - just pop one in his mouth, it dissolves instantly.<br>  <br>  I stopped using them because I saw no difference.  The ingredients are so diluted I doubt they do anything.|`|tapFZBowaa	We have had great luck with them!  My son really felt better after them and they helped him relax!|`|FLpMShKNaa	depends on the baby. Motrin and tylenol were what worked for mine.|`|b7Z3OSRwaa	I was going to buy these, but my doc said they are not approved by the FDA so no way for me.  I am to afraid to give my baby things not approved.  But... I have heard they work great, by a few people.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	They seemed to work for my son.
wipJ9OE7aa	Are you waking him up the same time every morning? If so, I would suggest that you get him up a little bit earlier, like 10 minutes or so. Maybe that would help. Or you mentioned that you wake him up to pee in the middle of the night, maybe you could wake up him again in the middle of the night, like a few hours before you usually wake him up. So he would potty before bed, potty twice during the night, and again when you wake him up.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Stop the drinks about 4 hours until bed time instead of just 2? This would solve the having to wake him up at night problem as well more than likely! <br>  <br>  Edit: Maybe try giving him more drinks during the day time to prevent dehydration, and try cutting back a half an hour a time from what your doing now,  or putting a potty chair in his room, telling him if he wakes up to go to the potty, there are several things you can do honestly.|`|axOJ2XUIaa	His sphincter muscles might not be mature yet.  That happened with one of my girls.  I'd leave the pull-up on and once his muscle tone improves with time you can take it off.  Don't make a big fuss over it.  I asked her doctor when it she would be dry and he said he could guarantee that it would before she went to the prom.  What he meant was that I shouldn't worry about it.  So don't you worry.  He can't help it.|`|haabfMtkaa	Get a good mattress pad and keep up the good work!! My daughter was in pull-ups(only at night) for what seems like almost to long and the same thing see would stay dry all night and then pee immediately in the morning. I also stopped putting her in them. We had about 3 accidents but she has finally got it(for the most part). I think it just takes practice for there little bladders|`|WhbLhZoYaa	my daughter been potty train since 2 1/2|`|yJ7X3oEdaa	I'm kinda going through this right now too. My daughter is almost 3 and 1/2, was almost potty trained before turning 3 but when her brother came she put it on hold for 7 months. She wears panties during the day but a pull up at night. Sometimes she wakes up dry, some times wet so I'm not ready to give up the pull ups. Maybe you could bring in a little potty to his room for when he wakes up if she can't make it to the rest room. I wish you the best luck!|`|hKJIDdVqaa	may I suggest plastic sheets and let him be free.....
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	My oldest didn't say her first word (other than mama/dada) until she was 13 1/2 months old.  She didn't walk until that age either, and right after she started walking, she started talking.  Her first words were "puh" (for "up" when she wanted to be picked up) and "oof oof" ("woof woof" for dog).<br>  <br>  After that, her speech just took off.  Her words weren't clear, but by 22 months, she was speaking in sentences and narrating whatever her Little People did.  By age 3, she was speaking perfectly clearly and even saying all her sounds correctly (including the difficult "R").  So she started a little late, but just took off from there.<br>  <br>  It's possible that your little one has a personality like mine -- she needs to be sure that she can do something before she'll try it.  My daughter has always been like that.  She'll seem like she's behind, but then once she does something, she does it well fairly quickly.<br>  <br>  Keep talking and reading to your little one as much as possible.  Try to gently encourage her to imitate your words, but don't push it, or she may become resistent.  Listen hard for words that don't sound like what you'd expect.  My 18-month-old says "la" for ball, bowl, and doll (using the ending sound).  He also says "lella" for Cinderella (or any other fancy doll/princess) and gorilla.  "Bup" is up, dip (like ketchup or Ranch dressing), and help.  Oh, and he almost never calls an animal by name -- he just makes the sound instead (moo for cow, baa for sheep, etc.).  We just use context to figure out what he's saying.<br>  <br>  Sign language is another great tool at this age, and you'll be surprised how quickly she'll pick it up.  My son has been very interested in signing, and he consistently uses at least 10 signs (more, all done, please, thank you, milk, water, juice, apple, banana, ice cream, cracker, potty, play, and eat).  He also knows book and sleep, but doesn't use them much.  We did a bit of signing with my older two, but not much, and I really wish we'd used it more.  It has helped my youngest to communicate so much better, and I think it makes him eager to learn even more ways to communicate (through speech *and* gestures/signs).|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i really wouldnt worry, just read to her when you can, books with objects and animals are fine. dog cat, cow are all simple words she can pick up and you can teach her the noises too:) when you take her walks or out point to things etc.keep it simple and one day shell surprise you. my daughter is 15 months. a couple months ago all shed say was hiya mom(when hungry lol) num num(when mom got the food lol) and ta. she says a few more but theres still alot of jibberish there...her new words are tikka tikka<<yet to figure that out pretty sure its a big nothing tho lol:) good luck|`|KmC0K59taa	I wouldn't worry about it.  My daughter talked a little later than other kids in her daycare class.  As long as she is understanding you and saying some words, it is ok.  She'll be talking soon.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	you have to make her use words..  if she can communicate properly without words then why bother trying.. its working too well for her.  you have to start not understanding her and let her know that she has to say the word.  itll take a bit and is very frustrating for her because she wont understand why you suddenly dont understand her but necessity is the mother of all inventions.. don't be surprised if she has a word for something that isnt even close to what it should be.. my daughter used to call her blankies 'gitchens', Christmas was 'Chrinchris' pajamas 'jamas', light 'li-li' and other such weird things.. but she was consistent and she slowly morphed the word to be correct over time.  key thing is for consistency and not regression for words she knows.  best of luck.. my daughter was a little slower than other children but as an only child who stays at home I wasnt surprised.<br>  <br>  Also try reading a lot to her and telling her verbally everything you are doing as you are doing it|`|CWVBfaPwaa	We actually bought sign language DVD's. My son is not deaf, but I've heard that children can communicate at a much younger age and throw less temper tantrums because of this. He picked up on it pretty quickly and it's easier for us to understand his gibberish. He'll say "gil" and make the sign for milk, so now we can understand him. He is now 19 months old and talking more than ever!|`|bFNtJogSaa	My daughter is the same age. And she says Dada, ball, Hello, and mama. That's all. As long as shes listening to you and paying attention you really shouldn't worry! She's probably just observing everything and will be talking in no time! Good Luck!|`|AA11327039	When my son was 13 months old he qualified for speech therapy (JUST BARELY).  He wasn't saying much and didn't understand anything I was telling him.<br>  <br>  He's now 22 months old and actually understands most of what I say but still doesn't talk much.  He'll say a lot of ..."Hey can you say .....book" and he'll repeat 'book'. or whatever word I have him say, but as far as independent words go....he's still not talking.<br>  <br>  She actually sounds right on target.  Just read read read to her.  Read recipes, books you like, books she likes, parenting magazines, the newspaper, etc.<br>  <br>  Sing lots and lots of nursery rhymes songs.  We have a 3disk (one in each car and one in the house) CD full of nursery rhyme songs.  My son will sort of 'sing' along to these and in the car is when he says the most words.  (Star, from twinkle twinkle little star...and various other words)|`|TzY9vkinaa	my sister's boy just started speaking well enough to understand him. he's about 4. But he's be going to speech therapy...
fb8e2cf250a0e7a8ad6b9e89534114d1aa	Mine broke after I got up in the middle of the night to find the bed a little wet, as soon as I sat on the toliet it gushed.  Trust me I knew what had happened and I was only 36 weeks.|`|NZid2d1Paa	well my sister's water broke when she was going to the bathroom at home, but you will know, she knew right away what it was. Its a way different feeling then going to the bathroom, not sure about the tub,but its probably the same way with that.|`|2TAFN9lzaa	Mine did while I was going to the bathroom. I did think it was pee at first but it kept leaking out after my bladder was empty.|`|em8A42Bqaa	Its not a dumb question, b/c I think that all the time.  I think that would be confusing, I'm guessing you can feel it, it probably feels like you have to pee.|`|K5yWLudIaa	You probably don't want to bring your nice glasses of water into the bathroom, it is very easy to slip and fall and the water glass will break upon hitting the tiled bathroomed floors.
bMvAmMTaaa	when i was in the hospital after having my daughter, i found they provided everything from sterilisers, an electric breast pump room to formula.<br>  <br>  take your breast pump with you, and if you find you cannot get much colostrum, i was told in the hospital that baby has max nutrition for the first 3 days from taking in yours when inside the womb. so don't worry too much, just try your best.<br>  <br>  when on the breast anyway, don't know exactly how much baby gets.<br>  <br>  good luck x|`|yB5go5wbaa	Colostrum is enough for the baby in the first few days; my nurse told me it's like cheesecake, so even though you don't make a lot, it's rich enough to hold them over until your milk comes in.  I do think it'd be hard to express, just because you realllllly don't make a lot.|`|AA12193113	I must warn you, Pumping is not going to be as easy as you think it may be and yes its time consuming.  When I pump, I only get half of what my baby can get. Your not going to able to do it long if your not going to let your baby feed from your breast.  I wish you the best though.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I don't know your reasons, but nursing my baby at my breast has been one of my favorite parts of being a mother.  It is hard to put into words just how beautiful it is to look down and see that tender, precious face nuzzled up to me and drawing life from my body.  Breastfeeding to me is almost like saying a prayer to God thanking him for making this perfect baby for me.  I know you want to give your baby the benefit of your nutritious breastmilk, but your baby also wants and needs the warm, soft, loving benefit of your bosom.  It isn't sexual, it isn't gross, it is perfect.|`|IRZ4czGPaa	the more you pump the more milk you'll get!<br>  they gave me a pump and disposable bottles at the hospital.<br>  dont worry about hunger if the nurses think hes hungry theyll give him some formula usually your mill is enough because newborns wont take anymore than one ounce at the most!<br>  good luck!|`|gzjWQo1eaa	You're creating way more work than you need to, believe me it's much easier to just nurse the baby. And babies have little to no nutritional requirement for the first week so don't wory|`|1SpbRdPEaa	i think you should definitely feed your baby a bottle because breast -feeding is hard to do so i think you should definitely go for it.|`|xApAWlshaa	Well just breastfeed the child.let the child suckle you.its the wonderful gift of maternal breast.don't take it for Granted|`|MUVdG9n1aa	A brand new baby doesn't eat very much... your colostrum only lasts a couple days. Just make sure you are pumping like every two hours and emptying the breast as much as you can so you can establish a milk supply for the first six weeks. You will need to bring your own bottles, you can't count on them having stuff for you. You can ask them about sterilizing at the hosp. Maybe you should discuss this with your doctor ahead of time so you know what to expect. If your baby was a preemie and couldn't nurse you would have to express and give it the milk that way so they must have some way to help you. Good luck with this, you will really need it. Can I ask why you don't want to breastfeed?|`|hhWDHmfyaa	The best laid plans of mice and men......<br>  <br>  BTDT.  Please plan to change all your plans on the birth of your child.  The ease and joy of simply breastfeeding vs. the sheer waste of valuable sleep time in dealing with bottles might just change your plans.  Better to be prepared.<br>  <br>  The hospital will have nurses and lactation consultants who will show up to assist you in everyway.  The first few days it is critical to keep the baby hydrated.  There is no magic guage except your little one.  He may burn hot and he may be cool - this will decide how much milk he needs.<br>  <br>  Do take your pump and bottles to the hospital, only so you can have ample question and answer time with the expert nurses.  Your milk will not come in for several days.  You and the babe, working together, will bring this about when his needs and your body are in line.  Give yourself grace and peace.  The ignorant and the control freaks have wonderfully useless schedules that often harm babies.  Trust the nurses.  Trust yourself.  Trust your babe and relax.  This time will come and pass too quickly.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	You don't need to worry about "hunger" the first few days. The best you can do is pump, pump, pump, pump, pump! You'll need to pump a lot to be able to produce a sufficient amount of milk.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Nature knows what she is doing.  Babies just don't need much food in those first few days.  They are born with extra fluid in their system AND they are often sleepy from being born.<br>  <br>  But remember that a newborn will want to suckle even if not actively hungry. So a  new baby nursing at the breast will nurse long after the time the quarter teaspoon of colostrum has been extracted. The extra nursing encourages the milk to come in and satisfies baby's sucking needs... a wonderful system, if you think about it.<br>  <br>  So... if you are determined to pump-only from day one, your baby will probably need a pacifier to satifisy sucking needs between feeds, and you will need to pump long and often to encourage your supply to come in well. <br>  <br>  The hospital will have a breastpump for you to use.
J2glFOkhaa	I have multiple ovarian cysts along with endometriosis. We TTC for a long time with no luck. We didn't give up<br>  <br>  I'm pregnant now and due in September.

zxNEewYzaa	That's horrible, yet I can relate with that. My brother has this problem too.. He's 15 and a freshman and I'm 16/sophomore. He use to stay up ALL night long and play games, and would sleep either at school... or he just wouldn't go. It got to the point where my father called the school to find out how many days he's missed...he was one day from failing an entire year of school over the xbox. I believe my brother has an addiction he wont admit it to anyone-- but only when me and him are alone.. he says he  just can't stay off of it. Well my mother didn't know he was missing school (because she was at work by the time we got up--sometimes he would lie to me and say he was going to walk to school and really stay home). My advice to your mothers friend is to take it..... it will be hard he will fight with you but if that's what it comes down to and if she really loves him then she would. And I'm sure she does, eventually when his grades get up and he starts going to  school you give him a little bit of playing time and more and more, but don't let it get out of control. My brother went from playing almost 11 hours of x box to 3 so I know that kid can do it too! good luck with everything I'm sorry I don't know an organization of any sort to help you but I'm sure that they do have some kind of gamers counseling! Good luck I'll keep you in my prayers!|`|1enIWBGnaa	Common sense works for me too.  She should make sure he's in bed no later than 9 pm.  Lock the game system up in a secure area or remove the computer (which should never be in a child's room to begin with) from his room altogether.  Only allow him to use the computer with her home.<br>  SHE needs to step up to the plate and act like a 'parent' before she loses her job.  It sounds like she could care less about her son and her job.|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	Its is obviously all his mom's fault because she lets this crap happen.  If I was here, the thing would be gone without notice and would only come back at the end of the school year, and only if he could clean up his act by then.  <br>  <br>  She's grooming her son to be a total loser and in just a few years he'll be working half-assed at the local McDonalds and living her her basement.|`|Gburbcuiaa	Take the game system out of his room at 11 every night. Or she could keep all of the games in her room and come collect the game at a reasonable hour ( There's not much point in hooking up the system every night.) She could take the system if she finds him playing it when he is not allowed.|`|29I3YjjPaa	Make him get a job, make him do extra curricular events instead of gaming...maybe have disciplined him better when he was younger so that he wouldn't have gotten this out of control...consult his father if he is around, remove the gaming system, take away his rewards, friends, phone, going places, remind him you gave him life lol you can take it away from him, that your the provider of the family and he is a child!|`|5ZdB5K6Raa	If it was me then i would make his butt go to school it wouldn't matter what time he went to sleep!

Its time for that mother to put her foot down|`|axOJ2XUIaa	No kid should have a TV in his room let alone a game box.  If anyone thinks this is harsh, psychologists say this.  You can't monitor what they are watching or doing if this stuff is in their rooms.  My girls never had their own TV in their room until they entered college.  We always watched what they wanted (I've seen every episode of Full House), until they went to bed and it was fun.|`|gxWSan9Raa	I would take away the Xbox especially when you know that it is keeping him awake it is definately harder said then done.  I know kids can be tough I have a 9 year old that was watching movies until late.

I wish them luck because it can be difficult.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	your friend is  a weak parent and cant say no to her child so let her deal with the consequences, just take this as a lesson for when you have kids honey,<br>  <br>  all kids even teens need guidlines and boundries|`|yxRGDjs2aa	Hi I read your question with interest!  I am guessing here but would it be true in saying that the boys Father is not around?  That makes it a lot harder for the Mum.  So what to do. 1. The Mum should first have a meeting with him at a time when they are both not in a rush to go anywhere, or half asleep.  2.  Then she explains the problems from her point of view, try to address any issues he has.  3.  Get the list of chores on a board and work out together what he should do around the house.  3.

It  could even fall in the same class as smoking or drug addiction. I was not aware of this till our neighbours 15 year old ran away on Canadian Thankgiving Day. He had become so addicted, he would stay up all night and even on the Thursday before the Thanksgiving weekend, skipped school and came home when his parents were at work to play. He played Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare live. For missing school and returing home to play that day the Xbox was grounded. However, Brandon took it from where his parents had placed it during its grounding . He was caught playing it and it was then taken out ot the house. Brandon ran away from his home late that afternoon. His parents had no idea of how he was addicted and no idea they had just taken away his whole world and his identity.<br>  Brandon died all alone that evening. He fell from a tree in a famers corn field. Which was just  a few miles from his home. We think he was lost and climbed the tree in the dark, to try and see the lights of town and return home. Thousands of searchers from all walks of life and all over Canada, looked for him for 3 weeks. Two hunters found his remains.<br>  Brandon was a beautiful child full of fun and always liked a joke now and then. He was never in any trouble and everyone loved him as if he was their own.<br>  My reason to tell you this story of Brandon, is not just because I was his neighbour, but to bring to every parents attention, something I had no idea of till Brandon died. Gaming addiction....<br>  Video games are great for all of us. The only thing parents have to be careful it does not become an addiction. From what  you have told me, I suspect this boy has the same addiction as Brandon had. I hope my long post here has helped convey this to you. You can not just take the game away cold turkey. Like a drug addiction he needs help and right now.<br>  You can type in Brandon Crisp in Google. Read about Brandon, there are pictures of Brandon and the long story of him and the tragic ending to a beautiful boys life over a game.<br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher Canada )|`|vcxdTXbraa	My mom had this same problem with my sister. She refused to get up to go to school She went to court and filed and unruly child report but I do not think it really did anything
46K4FtE0aa	You need to take a test when you are at least 7 days late for your period, using the first urine you pass when you wake up in the morning, if that is negative and you still don't get your [period, then wait until you are 10 days late3 and ask the doctor to take a pregnancy blood test.  Some tests claim to give you an earlier result, but if your hormones are slow to build up you will get a negative result, even though you are pregnant. Urine tests rely on the hormones in your urine being a certain level, if they fall a fraction below the required level you will get a negative, irrespective of if you are pregnant or not. You can have many false negative results with a urine test, but only very rarely do you get a false positive result.|`|TVEJS83Waa	If your period was feb 19th then you are most likely to ovulate March 3 - 5 th, If you had sex in between these days then you can be pregnant. It is too early to take a test, but then again everyones body is different. Wait to see if you miss your next period, and then take a test.|`|LCHnUuS6aa	Yes.  Save your money and the anxiety involved and wait until you miss your next period.|`|7b2ddd2f8ffad9c0b9a57aea08694331aa	wait until you're period is due. if it doesn't come, then take a test.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|DMDojS3naa	yes...i would wait until the 20th at the earliest to take a pregnancy test. Your usually supposed to wait until you miss a period. But they have tests that will give you a result up to 4-5 days before you miss your period. Good luck!|`|MHNxYivzaa	Yeaa.<br>  you don't take a test until atleast 5 days after your first missed period. <br>  if you do it before it is just a waste of a test and a waste of money.|`|9puZ8W95aa	wait until it is around the time of your period.<br>  If you are unsure of when that would be, then take a good guess and take a first response HPT.|`|SiIuJXvwaa	yea way to early it might give you a false neg. wait til around the time you would be due them cause you wouldn't be due them for another 2 weeks anyway good luck|`|ndO6MiQaaa	did u get a period any symtoms like waight gain crying  hormonal it think u should do the test|`|KNyotuRYaa	yes,wait untill you are late|`|0fd84ba056353594be65eb4771d885ebaa	after the baby is born|`|M3GDjEHtaa	whenever you think you're pregers...
rlMbcfpXaa	Hey there...I am 34 weeks pregnant and have only gained 10 lbs, so I would say you are right on track. You will probably gain about 1 lb per week between now and the baby's birth!|`|dDVAUA9saa	Everybody gains different weight during pregnancy - with my first, I only gained 18lbs.  I am curently 24 weeks with my second and have gained 12lbs but was underweight to start.  I am 5'6" and weighed 115 prepregnancy, my midwife suggested I should gain between 26 and 40lbs, which I most likely will not.|`|kT7GVOosaa	since you were so small you can gain as much as you want but in a perfect world you only have 7 more weeks. thats not a lot of time to gain weight. if your doctor is not worried then you shouldn't be either.|`|DMDojS3naa	I think its normal....everybody is different. If your very petite, then your probably not going to gain that much...but during your last month you gain more weight. I gained about 30 pounds but i started out weighing 130 and im 5"2...so if your still a little nervous about it, ask your doctor. Although im sure if you have been going to regular doctor visits, they will always weigh you and track how much you gain. So i would think if it was a problem they would have told you already. Hope this helps!|`|MHNxYivzaa	Well since you are only 33 weeks pregnant your are still okay.<br>  you gain the most weight in the last couple weeks of pregnancy.<br>  plus since you are such a small girl you won't gain what you think you will gain.<br>  I only gained 23 lbs my whole pregnancy but I also threw up more than I ate in my first and second trimester.

856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Let me tell you something.....I am 39 and just had my last baby.  I had four children from a previous marriage and thought I was all done.  I was in your same position.  When I found out I was pregnant I was TERRIFIED because my poor body just isn't what it used to be.  I went to my doctor and discussed it with him and he told me that as long as you can get pregnant, it's fine.  Well...I took his advice and had the baby.  The pregnancy was just like any other pregnancy of mine.  I bitched alot more...lol...because I am a lot older and achier now than I was when I was young.  I was considered a "high risk" pregnancy because of my age, but everything went fine.  The delivery was great!  (I had all mine naturally...only this time I was smart and said YES to the drugs.)  <br>  <br>  Now the difference in raising this one has been like night and day!  I am so much wiser now than I was with the others.  It's so much easier now.  I  mean, don't get me wrong....I am not a quick as I used to be, and I hated lugging around a car seat and stuff, but he was a giant help with all that stuff.  But the relationship I have with this child is an amazing one!  I am so much better now than I was in my twenties.  <br>  <br>  I think that if you have the support of the father (mentally and physically and spiritually) you will do great, if you WANT the baby.  Don't just do it for him....do it only if you are ready for a few extra aches and pains, and not feeling too old for those nights with no sleep, etc.  You have an opportunity to really "relate" to a little person now, and be so much better of a mom than before you gained all the wisdom you have now.  I say if you want to do it...go for it.  My experience has been wonderful.  Wouldn't trade him for the world.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little.....and good luck in your decision!!<br>  <br>  Kelly|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	I found this for you to read:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.preconception.com/articles/considering-pregnancy/babies-later-in-life-1458/" rel="nofollow">http://www.preconception.com/articles/co...</a><br>  <br>  Does he want a child? Will he want that child to have a full sibling? Do you want to have another child or two? I really think those are the most important questions.<br>  <br>  I don't think 40 is too late.  It just opens you and the baby to more medical risks than you did when you had your 1st two children.|`|l0bLt48Kaa	my mum had a baby at 43...hes precious!!! theres nothing wrong with it...good luck:)|`|iMxDPtWbaa	Your not too old until your body says so. If you feel like you can have a child and love it like all the others that you have then go for it. I personally think that it is better for you to be older because of all the teenagers these days having kids and not being able to support them. I think that it is good because by now you should have some money and be able to support them. So  yes. Do it.|`|dl5ZWzpGaa	my co worker had a baby at 40 and he's a very healthy baby.  They only thing is when you have a baby past 35 is that the risk for down syndrome goes up, but they can check for that in your 16th week and you can make the decision of terminating the pregnancy if that is your wish.<br>  <br>  <br>  scroll down to, "when and who"|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I don't think you're too old. It depends on how you feel, you're only as old as you feel. They say that women over 35 have an increased risk of down syndrome. But I would ask your gyno, he or she knows what kind of shape your body and uterus is in, and they will be able to tell you if they think it is a good idea or not.|`|RJLSN6BXaa	if you want to try...then go for it.. but being older puts you and your potential baby at risk for certain things...for example you are more likely to have multiples at an older age more likely to develop things like gestational diabetes, and babies with mothers of advanced maternal age are more likely to have downs syndrome|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	Gosh! it complicates things so much when you have your kids, he has his and together you have another.  I wouldn't advise it.  But since you asked because you really do want another, I don't think 40 is too old but you know you'll have to be supervised by a doctor for problems with the pregnancy.|`|NZid2d1Paa	I know someone i work with, she told me that she had her first child when she was 39 yrs, and she is doing great and her child is also, i know there are some risks involved. But you can talk to you doctor about and see what would be the best. Good luck!|`|SiIuJXvwaa	if your healthy, happy, and understand that it wont be like your in your 20s and 30s then go for it. just go down to your doctor and get a check up to make sure all is well in you then by all means go for hun good luck|`|MRV9rNyjaa	im glad you found somebody who loves you and accepts your 2 children. i hope that they were able to make the transition so easily. if you are conderened about your age, go and talk to your doctor.see what he has to say.|`|gccK6q20aa	sorry but i think that is to old. your will be putting your body and baby at risk for many things. plus just think when that baby is 18 you will be 58-59 years of age. you won't have the energy or patients.|`|h6vqu7mjaa	I met a woman who was 46 and prego. She went into labor early but everything was ok. I would suggest asking your doctor about the risks.|`|ybexjS2Paa	I don't think it's too late. Many women decide for a child at this age. Best it would be consulting your doctor. Good luck|`|SjLDdUh7aa	You're 40, not 75.  SO I would not think you're too old to have a child even at this age.|`|X4JnjNQ2aa	my mum had one at 41<br>  as long as your happy, then age shouldn't matter.|`|f459cc0f525ea8d849cf09f4734bd6a5aa	My mother was 40 when she had me, and I was her<br>  only child........ I would go for it, why not?|`|DX0r83p4aa	I think if you still have your period it may be for a reason. So I will try it. But you need to talk to a doctor about it before doing it in case of a risk for your life or the baby. You also need to know that for your age they are more possibilities to have a baby with down syndrome. I do not think there is something wrong with babies with D.S. but think about that baby's future. Who will look for him when you are gone. I hope that what ever decision you make, make you and your husband happy. Good Luck|`|9puZ8W95aa	actually Doctors are recommending older women to have kids.<br>  Its better in raising them since they have seen more than a 19 year old having a kid.|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	being 40 isnt too old for kids. people are havin kids well into their 40's now.<br>  <br>  i personally dont think it is wrong or weird for a woman your age to have a child, unless they are not fit enough, or lack the energy to have and take care of a baby.|`|AA11764194	No dear.. not too old..

You shouldn't throw it out the window because of a number (your age).  Talk with your OB to get advice from him/her on what you should expect as far as more monitoring goes.  Unless they see anything worrisome, you should be fine.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I had two high risk pregnancies, and I enjoyed the increased monitoring because it gave me piece of mind.  Each person is different when it comes to pregnancy, but I don't need to tell you that because you've already had two.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TMAq2m7Gaa	I had my first child at 40, and my wife is 38. Risks do go up after 40, but if you take care of yourself, that helps a lot. My wife is very health conscious and rated the same as 20 year old on the doctors exam.|`|eFkdCBjkaa	You go girl. I know plenty of women that have had babies in their 40's.|`|vcxdTXbraa	You are not too old but remember this....you will be 60 when the baby graduates high shcool. And you run alot more risk|`|POGZZmoUaa	Having a baby with your new husband is an idea with lots to consider.  More than your age being problematic is how your other children would feel about this idea.  With their Daddy gone and you having continued with your new life, how would this impact your kids?  Would they feel pushed aside while another part of the family is becoming the center of attention?  If your man has no prior kids, couldn't he put his all into yours and add to the security of the family he took the responsibilities for?  I don't think your age is the question to be considered, it's your kids.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	I think that if that is what you both want go for it, But you will need an amnio, done to make sure the baby is ok No downs syndrome, and go from there. If you don't care that you will be in your 60's when he gets married, than nothing should stop you. People are having children well into their 40's.|`|rlMbcfpXaa	NO!!!

I wish you much luck with the new baby....xoxox|`|LY2LSzPJaa	I do not think 40 is to late. Just research the problems you can have, and think about doing the infant thing all over again. If you really feel you can handle that then go for it. Do not let age get in the way of a beatiful blessing like that. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck mama|`|UEAzzroAaa	40 is putting your baby at higher risk for down syndrome etc. But its not too late. If you and your husband are healthy, give it a shot!

hzgFAJv0aa	As others have pointed out, there is no reason meeting and choosing adoption and adoptive parents cannot happen AFTER the birth of the child. <br>  <br>  I FIRMLY believe that APs and FPs should make every possible attempt to maintain ON GOING RELATIONSHIPS with each other, if for no other reason than for the sake of ensuring that the child knows ALL of his or her family and can base his or her OWN relationships on personal knowledge and experiences rather than having them dictated for them. (This is also smart for medical reasons.)<br>  <br>  "Someone mentioned that one "positive" (if you can call it that) is that the adoptive parents at least get to meet the first mother and hear her side of the story, rather than just false info from the agencies."<br>  <br>  I agree to a point. BUT, if adoptive parents were really that interested in knowing about their child's origins and wanting to be able to get the answers and info that you are talking about, one meeting isn't gonna cut it. I don't believe that people can sincerely think that it is ok to just get the info and then push a child's living family out of their lives. As if information doesn't change and discoveries aren't made over the course of a person's lifetime. If APs truly wanted to "know" they would make the effort to maintain a real relationship. Otherwise it seems to be to be a thin disguise for trying to get "service records" on the "product". Almost like buying a used car. UGH. It seems almost rude to me.<br>  <br>  I also want to point out that agencies DO lie but some APs (and FPS) also "pick and choose" what information they wish to acknowledge and omit as well. And there are also some who just outright LIE. The ONLY way to be sure of "the story" is to maintain on going contact and keep detailed records.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	"So I ask...do you think it is at least better that the parents get a chance to meet one another rather than having to go on someone else's account of the events?"<br>  <br>  <br>  I think any and all people with the objective/agenda of separating a girl and her baby.....should stay away until she gives birth and makes her decision after recovery.<br>  <br>  There is no justifiable reason for those people to get involved prebirth.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	I think if there is NO one in the first Mother's family to raise the child and the child has been born, MAYBE a meeting can happen. Pregnancy is NO time to do a "meet and greet". To do so before birth is nothing but manipulation, intentional or not, by the broker or the pap.|`|JP04HX6maa	It sounds nice and genuine and respectful.<br>  <br>  The issue I have is that it could potentially make the mother feel as though she is even MORE obligated to give up her baby....|`|mEzhsu9Eaa	um i don't think that would necessarily have to happen PRE-birth. It could happen pre-adoption, but the adoption arrangement doesn't have to happen pre-birth either. <br>  <br>  That being said, if an adoption MUST happen, i'd say that its good for them to know each other and be an ongoing part of each others lives from there on out and have an established relationship.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	I'm against pre birth matches with the one exception I gave early as I feel it adds to the pressure for the mother to surrender.  Afterwards is better than before if it happens.|`|zVZgYEjMaa	There is no reason that meeting cannot happen after birth.|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	I think it is better to meet after the children are born, not before.|`|kmGW34unaa	butt sex baby. you and me on friday cause i get paid like that ***** dre'know work'n at the 24/7 at the crossroads. im gonna miss my uncle charles|`|91ff4dbbfbd7827f11b99d3972e133e1aa	I dont know I think thats a tough one, ive seen a lot of shows like<br>  dr. phil and other trying to reuynite familities like this and to me it<br>  doesnt really work, either the parent just gives a vague excuse why<br>  he/she wasnt in the childs life, and sometimes thats not good enough<br>  for most teenagers, if life has gone by you dont really need that person<br>  in your life anymore, my father left us when I was 5 and he came back<br>  when I was getting engaged and he thought that it was going to be<br>  easy coming into our lives like nothing happened, I didnt feel really<br>  anything for him, and not just because he didnt support me, but never<br>  any letters, explanations, no love there to me it seems, and I know im<br>  not adopted but the sentiment of abandonment I think is the same<br>  sure I gave him a second chance but he came into my life alittle too<br>  late, 18 kyrs later so meeting him was ok but I didnt see him as my<br>  father, just the person who gave me life, he calls 1 or 2 a year, he says<br>  hi to his grandchildren but I had great role models growing up so I<br>  didnt miss him very much, to me its sad to say he was a stranger.<br>  maybe if the open adoptions were respected maybe the children<br>  would not forget their parents but I can respect the new parents also<br>  not wanting that, theres many situations, parents that are abusive,<br>  drug addicts, alcoholics, crackheads, thugs, at least if I was a foster<br>  mother or adopting a child and I have a newborn I would ask for a<br>  closed adoption, because once that child is in my arms it is mine<br>  it might sound cruel but then have somebody else come and screw<br>  everything up which happens alot. That is just my opinion, but sure<br>  there can be some mediation/meetings but the trauma of abandonment<br>  never goes away, how do you get rid of that, sure I went to therapy<br>  before college to erase some anger issues but sometimes the feeling<br>  is overwhelming.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	I think that's pretty much the only thing that comes from pre birth matching that I would consider positive. From my point of view as an IA who thinks she might never have any of her questions answered, I think I'd like to know if we had the same color eyes, or looked alike or spoke alike. <br>  <br>  My mom told me that my sister's fmom wanted her (our amom) to adopt my sister after she met her and found out that she had already adopted me. My mom told me that she told my sister's fmom not to decide now, to wait until she had the baby to decide. They really only met by chance. A coworker of my mom's was living with my sister's fmom when she was pregnant. My mom thinks their meeting was fate. I don't believe in fate.<br>  <br>  I do think it is better that she knows a little about her fmom. I may never meet mine and may never know anything about her. I'd kill to know what she looked like, how old she was, etc. I'd be glad to know part of the real story rather than what the agency concocted for us. <br>  <br>  That's just me. I do agree with Phil though in saying that there's no reason that this meeting has to be before the baby is born. None at all.|`|cd98c09cc34c3c84ad4502d636e2d2beaa	The adoption industry in North American has planted the assumption in people's minds that adoption has to hurry-hurry-happen right at birth.  <br>  <br>  The mother and the couple wanting to adopt can always meet and discuss adoption *after* she has recovered from birth.  Pre-birth matching for this reason is NOT necessary.<br>  <br>  An agency does not have to swoop in and scoop a baby at birth, nor does a hospital -- even though believe me many do when they hear a mother is even considering adoption -- I know this from personal experience.<br>  <br>  But if the mother has recovered from the birth, with her baby, before considering adoption, and if she has received counselling that has focused on providing her with everything she requires to raise that child, then decides to explore adoption -- she can then interview couples with the aid of an agency or whatever else.  But coercion and the lack of information decision is avoided!  NO mother can give in informed consent before she has recovered from the birth and pregnancy/birthing hormones are no longer affecting her.  No mother can make an informed decision before her baby is in her arms and has been for days while they both spend time to get to know one another. <br>  <br>  That is another reason why pre-birth matching is not necessary.  Oh, but the industry found 40 yrs ago that if you prevent a mother from contact with her baby post-birth, especially from recovering from birth, you have a good chance of taking her baby from her and she won't be able to put up as much resistance as if you let her recover first. <br>  <br>  Baby brokers admit here that they do this because it will coerce mothers: <br>  <br>  " The open adoption process often begins with an adoption attorney. Paul Meding, a Columbia attorney who has been taking adoption cases for 12 years. ...  Meding will arrange a meeting with prospective parents and the birth mother. For Meding, this process has been successful. “In my opinion, when the birth mother has more input and can see first hand how important the adoption is to the family, it is more difficult for her to back out and disappoint them.”  (Columbia Star)<br>  <br>  "As many young women who choose to place their baby change their minds following the birth, factors such as having met with the adoptive parents could affect these decisions."  (Caragata, L. (1999)|`|xN5QDXMmaa	I think knowing the reason why and having meetings is a good idea, but it will take more them one meeting.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	I think the choice to have a meeting, or a phone call, or a letter, or to have ongoing contact before birth or no contact at all should be with the woman considering adoption.  I don't think the state has any business whatsoever telling her that she can't do this, if she chooses to.
bd22ca32eb55bc06eaa923b22bd0e54aaa	I had a very low supply. I tried everything and could never get more than about an ounce. I finally gave up because I started a medication that wasn't safe while breastfeeding.<br>  My mom said hers never came in with my sister.<br>  Good luck, I know it's frustrating.|`|t9S0dqfLaa	Yes I did.  I never became engorged and I had to pump because my son was losing weight.  When I pumped I hardly made any milk.  I finally decided to give up completely because I felt like I was always hooked to the pump and missing precious moments with my baby.  Aaden is perfect and thriving.  You just do what feels right for you and don't worry about what anyone else has to say about it :)|`|zRQmWC5saa	I did the same thing. I guess i got older and it turned to powder milk! lol jk but I did it and dont knwo why. unless it was b/c with my 3rd I took a pill that dried my breast milk up. after i took it , they had a recall on it! I think that was my problam!|`|EvecO3Tqaa	Hey!  I did not have the same exact problem as you, but I know how you feel.  While I was in labor, I had a fever for a few minutes (It literally was gone within 5 minutes).  After my baby was born, they put him in the special care nursery because of my fever.  Although he was perfectly healthy, they put him in the same nursery as the premature and very sick babies.  Before the fever I informed the hospital staff that i was going to be exclusively breastfeeding my son, however when he was brought to the nursery, they gave him bottles which totally violated my orders.  The doctors never said I was not allowed to breastfeed; they actually encouraged me to but the people in the nursery said I was coming in too often and that they were busy caring for the sicker children and they never bothered to call me to feed my son as they said they would, they just kept sticking a bottle in his mouth.<br>  <br>  Well, while in the hospital I was only given the chance to breastfeed one time!  I was never even offered a breast pump!  When I got home two days after delivering my son, my breasts were extremely engorged, hard as rocks and my nipples were flat.  My mother and fiance immediately went out and purchased a breast pump for me and for two days, nothing at all would come out.  I bought several tools including a latch assist, a nipple pumping device which was meant to make my flat nipples more erect and a second breast pump.  I kept trying to get my son to take my breasts for several minutes before I resorted to giving him a bottle.  Eventually, my breasts did express milk, however it was only small amounts.  The most milk I ever expressed at one time was about 2-3 ounces and it took me over an hour.  I was never getting any sleep and like someone else mentioned, felt as though I was missing precious moments of my sons earliest days.  He is almost two months now, and I still struggle with him rejecting my breast.  I constantly beat myself up about it but am starting to realize that this is not my fault.  He is healthy and like your child, accomplishing so many things that I may have missed if I still spent every moment I had trying to pump breastmilk.  Yesterday I realized that I hardly had anything left and my breasts have returned to their normal size.  <br>  <br>  I am glad that I am not alone and am truly sorry that you have struggled with this.  If you are still producing some like myself but are not producing enough to pump and would still like to try to breastfeed I highly recommend drinking mothers milk tea and/or taking fenugreek vitamins.  I applaud your decision to give your child formula.  I have felt guilty doing so, but after all of my efforts which also included taking my son out in the bitter cold to see a lactation consultant several times, I feel less guilty giving my child formula and would actually feel worse taking him out in this horrible weather than giving him FDA approved formula.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!  If you need someone to talk to about this let me know, I'm here, feeling just like you!|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	I have heard of some mothers who even after weeks, put the crying baby to the breast to comfort them and the second time around, the baby got it better.  Pumping is always not as effective as nursing, and of course more work.  Every once and a while you may want to try to put your son to the breast and you may be surprised.  In the meantime, keep drinking lots of fluids :)<br>  good luck
xc8bnpCvaa	Maybe, since he is not talking to you you should write him a letter. Remember to be open and honest, and not attack him for his behavior. Men respond to turmoil much differently than women. <br>  Look at it this way, he has probably worked hard to give you everything you want/need, including the opportunity to get a good education. In his mind, somewhere he failed. and he is scared that you will give up on your education etc. Your 16, right, so you are in the 10th 11th grade? <br>  Having a baby is going to make life completely different. You will be responsible for another human. THat means, no prom, football games etc.. That means studying for exams WITH a baby whose needs will have to be met first. There is so much that you probably haven't even thought of yet that you are not going to be able to do easily. <br>  How are you going to care for the child? You can't hold a full time job be a student and a new mother all at once, so your dad is probably looking at either you are going to drop out of school or THEY are going to be raising your baby. <br>  WHen the baby comes he will love it. But you have to understand, by getting pregnant at 16 you crushed his dreams for you. <br>  Talk to him, write a letter but give him some time. It is a hard thing to wrap your head around when your baby is having a baby.<br>  You also didn't mention the baby's father? where does he fit in the scenario?|`|AA11542929	give him time to come around.. i am 19 and i told my parents they were mad my dad didnt talk to me for a while then he came around.. he basically said and did the same thing.. give it time..<br>  <br>  and about ur friends screw them.. u know who ur real friends are when they stay there and help u and be there for u.. i been there too.. i got like very few friends now.. if i get a handful of them that havent had kids then its a mircale.. they will ditch u but forget them.. they aint a real friend then|`|kT7GVOosaa	you need to sit him down and explain that you know you messed up. tell him he has always been there for you in the past and you need him now more then ever. Tell him that you need his help and support so you and his grand baby can be healthy. as for your friends, friends come and go but family is forever.|`|nXZEoDO7aa	If he loves u he will not leave you like that, he will come back, beelive me, just call him with love 1ce like a daddy's sweet girl.<br>  i feel for you, wish you best of luck in future, maybe the baby is the luck for you in life.|`|UEAzzroAaa	Your are his baby, he will accept it sooner or later.|`|46K4FtE0aa	First of all your friends weren't really friends in the end when you needed them were they, so they are no loss. Your dad is a different matter, he is in shock at the moment and doesn't know how to handle the situation, mums find it a little easier to understand and cope. Your dad will come round eventually, just give him a little space and time to get used to the idea. Your mum could play a big part in this if she has a quiet word with him, mums seem to have a way of telling dads things and calming them down, where they won't listen to you. So give it a little time and don't worry, you still have your mum, who will stand by you. even if dad sticks this out to the end, he will cave in when his grandchild is born. Good luck.|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	You're dad is in shock and no doubt disappointed.  As a father of a girl, myself,  I can tell you I'd feel the same way.<br>  <br>  You see, your dad had a vision for you.  He's had it since you were a baby.  It probably went something like this: Daughter graduates high school, then university, finds a great job, works for a few years and brings a nice man home.  He too is univeristy educated and has a good job.  This guy loves you very much, and your dad can tell.  This boy asks him for your hand in marriage.  You have a beautiful wedding. You dance together.  He makes a speech telling all how proud of you he is and how much he loves you.   A few years later the two of you surprise him and tell him he's going to be a grandfather!!!! He cries tears of happiness and again tells all his friends how proud of you he is.  <br>  <br>  See why he reacted like he did.<br>  <br>  I'm sure he'll come around, but he's dealing with this too.  I'm sure it's hard for him to think of his baby like this.|`|7b2ddd2f8ffad9c0b9a57aea08694331aa	[[coming from a 16 year old - 4 months pregnant - i understand]]<br>  <br>  you're his little girl, of course he's going to over-react at first. but he loves you, and he will accept it eventually. just give him some time to process it. it's a big blow for any family, i promise. especially because you're 16. <br>  <br>  and i do know what you're talking about with friends like that, i have a few. but i guarantee that turning to cutting isn't going to help anything. remember that right now, your baby is your main concern. forget the idiots who say stupid s**t. they don't get it. <br>  <br>  i really do wish you the best of luck. you can email me if you would like to speak further.|`|v5AOyYIGaa	your dad will come around eventually, its a big shock for him, your his baby now your having your own baby.

He will come around. This is how he has to deal with this pregnancy. Everyone is different.<br>  <br>   I would say this to him though.

It was a very difficult 9 months but the second my daughter was born my dad apologized to me telling me how wrong he was trying to convince me to not keep it.. He got nicer at about 6 months but was still mad it did take until my daughter was born.. and Now our relationship is better than it was before I had Maddison. He loves her and Me and Everything has truned out amazing. My life is so amazing with her and I finished school and everything. Everything will be okay. Just let him take his time to cope. He doesnt know how mcuh he will love the baby yet.. but he will .. :]|`|68xqRr5raa	I was 17 when I told my parents that I was pregnant. That was the first time they knew I was having sex so to say it was a shocker is a little of an understatement. I turned their world upside down and they were shocked, angry, worried, a whole barrage of things. But they came around and in the end they were and my dad still is very supportive of me (my mom died 2 years after my son was born). My baby boy is now 15 and I finished university, found a wonderful man, and am happily married and working in my chosen profession. My point is, that there is still hope. My dad didn't want to talk to me at first either.....you're probably his little girl and he's got a lot to think about with you bringing a little one of your own into the world so young. So, try to cut him some slack....bear with it. It'll be hard and you will be stressed and scared and you may lose some friends but in the end the people who truly love you unconditionally will be there for you. It's a good way to filter out the losers you may have thought were friends. I wish you lots of luck and hope that everything works out well for you and your baby to be. It can be done, it just takes a little perseverance and some hard work.|`|LkgrqlKXaa	I was 18 when I found out I was pregnant with my first child. My dad and I were always close and he didn't speak one word to me for a week and probably for another month it was small talk. He was extremely disappointed in me but you have to know that he is just worried for you. Worried about how his little girl is going to take such a big responsibility. It was the worst feeling in the world not having my dad talk to me but when my little girl was born he had the biggest smile on his face. Still to this day he is happy when he sees her. Give it time. It will take him a while to adjust to it. It really is a life changing thing, to have a baby. Plus, no dad wants to face the reality that his daughter was sexually active. I say pray about it and give it time. He will speak to you. You just have to give him his space. Maybe try writing him a letter telling him how you feel about the situation.|`|hlycbIjPaa	I'm sorry to hear that.<br>  I have a situation kind of like that, but the opposite. My mother was the one not speaking to me, and my father was the accepting one. My mother told me that if I kept the baby then I would have to find somewhere else to live. So I moved in with my boyfriend, the baby's father. I am 18, so it made it easier for my mom to kick me out without feeling guilty of my age I guess.<br>  Lately though, after my mom has had time to digest it all ( I gave her a couple months to digest it.) she has actually been somewhat supportive. She is buying me a stroller/carseat combo and we go shopping together alot.<br>  I think what you need to do is take it slow, and let them have time. One thing NOT to do is harm yourself. If you continue to do so, you will need anti-depressants and counseling. Plus, worst case, they can find you unfit as a mother.<br>  Wether you keep the baby or not, take care of yourself the best you can, and don't stress- it is connected to miscarriages.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Court xx|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	my dad was very upset with me when i got pregnant he barely spoke to me for the whole pregnancy <br>  <br>  the day i gave birth he was the 1st person to visit and was so sorry for how he treated me  he even said sorry!! something my dad has NEVER  done<br>  give him time he will come around x x x x|`|dPULl5hjaa	Your parents are angry and your Dad is MORE ANGRIER.

People are so self absorbed that when someone does something to themselves that somehow they wrecked their lives. Forget the "friends",forget anyone that won't support you and put their own agenda aside.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	I will tell you - don't expect anyone to agree with you having a baby at 16, don't expect anyone to support you.  If youre mom tells you she'll help you, great - but she doesnt have to.  And whether or not your dad 'comes around' you can't count on that.  It is what it is.  It's very sad that you are faced with this decision - keep the baby, abortion or adoption.  Youre obviously very immature if you're turning to self harm because your friends called you some names.  What kind of parent are you going to be for this child?  You've got a lot to think about.  good luck
q4rG5Dwtaa	Its stressful, I have three kids, 8 year old, 5 year old and 7 month old. Mornings are crazy, feed the baby, breakfast for the older kids, dress the kids, brush their teeth and hair, then the baby cries the whole time I'm trying to get ready. Then I have to get the two older kids to school on time. Most of the time one of the kids forgets their belt, or book sack.  The whole time I'm driving to daycare the baby screams, he hates being in his car seat. Usually by the time I drop them all off I'm late for work. After work, I start the whole process again, this time I have to get supper ready, homework, baths, rock the baby, kiss them goodnight, Get ready for morning phew. But its worth it.|`|zwctZ812aa	you'll be okay.  It is fairly exhausting, but you do what you have to do.  As a working mom, you may just enjoy the time you get to spend with your children even more because it is more precious.  It becomes very routine after a bit.

prqrQcd1aa	I would say that it is serious in both your husband and your child. Cancer is a very serious condition. If they were to find it again, and they do so early then there is more of a chance that he could get treatments and everything could be okay rather than the alternative. I see that your son has problems as well, and honestly both should be put at the same level of priority! <br>  I'm going to be blunt here, what would you do if your husband died of cancer because he wasn't put at the same level of priority as your son??|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Yes I do...

I would also treat my husband like an autonomous adult who is big enough and bright enough to make his own doctor's appointments, or not, if that is his choice.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	i most definitely would! but he also has to realize that if this is an ongoing medical condition then he needs to take care of himself so he can be there for his child.|`|II209CWKaa	Yes I would|`|mzeEo7wraa	Yes I would without even thinking twice about it|`|wUooHVU3aa	Already do.

I would be that guy in the Denzel Washington movie that was going to commit suicide so they could transplant my heart into my child.  <br>  <br>  But I think what you really want to know is why he is concerned when his child gets sick yet he doesn't seem to concern himself with his own health issues.  Believe it or not, a lot of people are like that.  Unfortunately, you will probably just have to take the lead here and make sure his appointments are made and make sure he keeps them.  Nothing like having another child to raise. Believe me, my husband was hospitalized for 10 days with second stage pneumonia because he wouldn't listen to me about needing to see a doctor.  He still doesn't listen. Just the way they are.<br>  Red

I was ready to have her out of me and into the world!<br>  What I do miss a little is sleep, I slept sooo much when I was pregnant. But I wouldn't trade her for sleep ever!<br>  <br>  :D|`|1SpbRdPEaa	well im sure you'll be alright and the baby should be there and it's okay to feel un comfortable you should try to relax.|`|SLph9RX6aa	yeah i really missed my son in there too, but trust me, 7 month on and i still remember what he was like inside, you will never forget that|`|a2c0c92c2b11472715578dcec0e6563caa	I dont miss that I any way,, I am so excited holding my baby and loving her all day and for ever.|`|4dXI8kuVaa	Aw, if you miss your baby maybe cuddling at night would help.|`|pDtoi6FUaa	no just make another baby|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	ME!! My daughter is 7 weeks tomorrow, and for about a week now I have been insanely jealous of any pregnant women I see, or when I answer questions from pregnant ladies on here. Yes I love my daughter more than absolutely anything, I love her cuddles and her smiles but my goodness I miss her kicking and feeling her hiccups :(|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I didn't like pregnancy, but I do miss feeling her kicking. I'd rather have her here though, there's nothing better than snuggling with her on the couch!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I did and still do at times....it is just one of those things. I just had a bit of a pregnancy scare. I am on Mirena and thought it failed me but I got my negative results this morning. Since we are nowhere near ready I am relieved but also kind of sad because I looked forward to feeling a baby in my belly again. My husband asked me why I sounded sad and I told him that once you've been pregnant and think that there is a baby in you again only to find out there isn't it is a little sad. You really look forward to that wonderful feeling of anticipation, feeling the baby move and wondering what the baby will be all leading up until it's birthday. I feel you... I totally do.|`|cv0foxlTaa	I had a really rough pregnancy and was happy to not be pregnant anymore.  That being said, I did miss the feel of his kicks in my belly, especially at night.  That lasted a couple of weeks.  Now, my son is 12 months old and even still, every once in awhile I'll have some gas and think it's the baby kicking!!!  :o)|`|yB5go5wbaa	I doooo.  I hated being pregnant too, haha.  I liked having a big, fat, hard belly though, and feeling him kicking all over at night after I ate.  And I liked people being nice and courteous to me because I was pregnant =)|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	I miss it too. I really want to get pregnant again just to watch my belly wiggle. I just don't think I want another baby! I would love to surrogate.|`|AA11476782	Yeah, for like a day I felt that way, but it's just the short time that it takes to adjust and to realize that this is what that was all about.  Now you have the finished product in your arms.  I do remember feeling sort of shocked that I wasn't pregnant anymore, if that makes any sense.  I wondered if it was because of not delivering naturally and having an emergency c-section, but I have read that it's normal.  Now that you mention it, my baby is almost six months old and I do still remember that sensation of her moving inside of me...wonder how long I will remember that, though!|`|AA10742362	i never felt my dd move in the womb.  hiccups?  all the time.  movement?  never.  doc said it was due to placenta being in front.  i could see her partying on the ultrasounds and my hubby would just look at me like im crazy and say u cant feel that?!?!?!? and id say nope!  so im much happier now that she has been born but all my friends/coworkers told me i would miss her being in my belly a ton til i explained the no feeling movement thing.  they ALL said they missed it.  i did feel empty and sort of useless, to use the term loosely, at first.  like a big empty hole but now i get to snuggle and feel her kick ALL the time, lol!!!|`|QCVzUC1baa	I rally missed it when i first gave birth but am used toit now.<br>  A lot of my friends are preggers at the mo and im starting to feel a tad jelous as i loved being pregnant.|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	I miss having an excuse for not having to suck my stomach in!  LOL.  No, really I do miss some parts like the movement but not all the other aches and pains.|`|tapFZBowaa	I am right there with you.... I loved being pregnant!  It was so awesome to know that my baby was there!  (Although it sure was nice to meet him!)|`|iOSEVRPPaa	Nope.  Don't miss it at all.  I have my baby to hold, kiss and cuddle whenver I want.  <br>  <br>  I did not enjoy pregnancy.|`|MYU46ap5aa	It's normal.  I missed it too and I hate being pregnant.  My friend said she felt the same way too.|`|etHC9ajHaa	i just miss the comfert oh him kicking

POGZZmoUaa	Frank, I question your motives to ask these questions.  How many women are you disgusted by that have gained too much weight (in your opinion), not exercised and use it as an "excuse"?  Who informed you that gaining only 10 pounds was healthy for the Momma or the baby?  Stop obsessing and go for a run, it's healthier.|`|FtJUyn7jaa	The average woman gains about 25-30 pounds during a pregnancy actually. More if they are underweight to begin with, less if they were overweight. <br>  <br>  That being said, some women do get a little out of control eating whatever they want all the time instead of eating healthier for themself and their baby.<br>  <br>  But before you judge, have YOU ever had a baby? Women's bodies are completely reshaped after a pregnancy sometimes, and losing that baby weight can be extremely difficult.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Um no sweet heart, it is recommended that we gain at least 20 pounds. The baby usually weighs between 5 and 10 pounds, that doesn't include the water, and the sack that the baby is in which can weigh up to 10 pounds itself. It would be very unhealthy to gain less that 15 pounds during pregnancy. Alot of women can't exercise during pregnancy, doctors recommend that we keep it very light, not lifting more than 10 pounds. Plus our backs hurt, we're nauseous for weeks on end, and there is nothing wrong with a little indulgence, we crave because we're lacking. I think you should try being pregnant before you go around thinking you know it all! ALOT and I mean ALOT of women have trouble loosing all the baby weight after pregnancy, and maybe if you weren't such an *** hole, she'd feel alot better about her self. It's hard as hell to have a new born and hit the gym while your va jay jay is still shrinking back down!|`|ZJvUnaQaaa	that is funny that you think "women" choose to gain weight. I hope that is a general question and you dont mean all. I gained 50 lbs with my first and only 20 with the other two.. Lost it each time. And only needing to gain 10lbs that is a dream from you. My kids were born all greater than 10lbs..lol.. can you imagine me trying to only gain 10lbs they would have been born malnourished and probably something wrong. Maybe you should read up on pregnancy.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	WOW....U seem to have some serious issues. <br>  <br>  Better yet why dont you get pregnant carry a baby for 9 months and see if all u gain is 10 freakin pounds.<br>  <br>  Wait not possible is it. Because men are to weak to carry a child and give birth to it which is y us women do it. SMDH<br>  <br>  The weight from carrying the baby,placenta,amniotic sac& fluid, and water weight is any where from 20-30 lbs so where do u get 10lbs from?<br>  <br>  U really should do some research before you come on here being insulting not knowing what the heck your talking about!!!!|`|ZhhH5cAdaa	it's fun.<br>  <br>  It's so easy, who the hell said 10 pounds tho, a 125 pound woman gets knocked up with a 9 pounder, I hope she's gains at lest 30.<br>  <br>  Your breast gain weight, your uterus gains weight, things you didn't know you even had gain weight.<br>  <br>  And alot of women get tired, I slept 3 months with each of my kids.|`|5ZdB5K6Raa	Well for one if you are a man, you wouldn't never understand but one of the main reasons we say that is because men want to knock us up then, go chill with there boys and hang out and once the baby is born they never want to help out or watch the baby so how about y'all help out more and us women will lose the weight|`|AA11538461	We don't "chose" to gain the weight.  I ate only when I was hungry and I strictly followed my pregnancy diet; still I gained 55 pounds.  I denied myself junk food, fried foods, and sweets and I still gained that much.  However, I lost 60 pounds in 6 1/2 months after she was born without trying.|`|zRQmWC5saa	umm i think u have no clue what ur talking about . first of all the fluid thats in the sac weighs anywhere from 4 to 5 lbs alone! r u telling me the baby must weigh 5 lbs? oh and thats not counting the water gain ur body stores while pregnant! so what ur really saying is the baby should weigh 0! <br>  first u should never complain about something u have no experience in. we dont " CHOOSE" to gain weight , u clown!<br>  why dont u men chose to shut ur mouth and listen to what really happens to ladies! let her talk to u and u really listen jerk!|`|9QVjNaIPaa	lol! looking for an uproar are we? well, just to say my piece...not all weight gain is intentional. i gained 60-65 lbs with each of my pregnancies. i was on a strict diet, didnt eat whatever whenever, and i did exercise, but it still happened. i didnt worry about it though because all that mattered to me was that my baby was healthy. and fyi-a 10 lb weight gain is not normal. 25-30 is.|`|AA11542929	HEY LOOK IT HERE!

Recommended is 20-35, however between chronically feeling like you are going to vomit and being ravenously hungry and miserable, and having horrid hemmorhoids, constipation, sciatica where pain shoots down your leg, insomnia from not finding a decent sleep position, heartburn from nearly everything the last thing you feel like doing is eating a salad and exercising.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	46 questions asked since you joined us on Feb. 20.

I gained 70 with my daughter,and I lost it all. It's really mean to say stuff how you are,and I don't understand why you are. Don't your relize we have a hard enough time feeling good about ourselves? It's men like you that destroy women's self esteem. It's not right. The estimated weight gain is 20-35 lbs. Grow up. Mature. Get less Superficial.|`|dPULl5hjaa	FYI - 1st child - My weight was 125 lbs. then up to 165 - lost ALL 40 lbs. in 5 months.<br>  <br>  2nd child - once again was 125 lbs. - gain 40 lbs. to 165 and lost ALL 40 LBS. IN 4 MONTHS.<br>  <br>  Everyone is different.

You go get pregnant then talk to us... turd.|`|nfu6LiVXaa	Well, there is a way to gain only 10 pounds...that's if the woman was so sick in the first trimester that she lost 15+ pounds. For example, starting weight 125, lost 15 in first trimester = 110, then gained the healthy 25, she'll be at 135. So from start to finish,she only gained 10 pounds (135 - 125). But that would mean she'll be throwing up constantly, bedridden and not eating anything for the first 3 months. I am sure most woman would rather gain the healthy weight than be that sick.|`|kT7GVOosaa	any OBGYN in the world will tell you you need to gain 25 to 30 lbs. 10 pounds isn't even enough for the baby and the sac it sits in! and after having a baby you don't have time to go to the gym and what not to loose the weight. obviously you are a person who is mad at the world and has to find something else to complain about to keep your mind off your own insecurities. hope you get help. maybe you should go hug your parents and go to church or something.|`|zATQaiwIaa	wow! That was some pretty uneducated stuff you are spewing!<br>  <br>  Medically - a woman who is at a healthy weight needs to gain about 25-30 lbs.  This is for her body to be able to breastfeed and for the childs nutrition and growth while developing.  Women underweight need to gain a little more and women overweight obviously need to gain less.<br>  <br>  And not ALL women gain 50 lbs or use pregnancy as an excuse to eat - a lot actually learn to eat better and look and feel better after pregnancy because of it!<br>  <br>  It sounds like you need to do some research before you make comments like this on a blog for women who are pregnant, trying to get pregnant or were pregnant at one time.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	All you really need to gain is 10 huh? Well lets see if you had a 7 pound baby which is average, 2-4 pounds for amniotic fluid. 1-2 pounds for breast engorgement and 2-3 pounds for the placenta. So if you managed to only gain those things and no more that would be 15-20 pounds depending on the weight of the baby and the bigger the baby the more fluid and placenta you have too.|`|AA12000741	ive only gained 12 lbs...and everyone is different...some women get preclamcia, diabetes, or other things during pregnancy that causes them to gain more weight... and you have no idea what its like to have a flat stomach no stretch marks one day to a few weeks later feeling huge and purple stretch marks...i know i can loose the weight but the marks will never go away...maybe fade a bit but not anything that is going to make me happy with my body again..but i also think that i am bringing a beautiful baby girl into this world and it makes it all worth it...|`|wFe7L1XJaa	Why do you care its not your body if some women chose to gain that much during their pregnancy then thats on them dont judge leave it to that person to decide what they wanna do and i dont know how many kids you've had but 10 POUNDS IS NOT ENOUGH FOR A GROWING BABY!!!!!!|`|sLERr3aAaa	Why don't you learn a little about pregnancy before you start opening up your mouth.|`|9fDkrrFyaa	get pregnant and let us know
adQQylCgaa	I gained 43 lbs with #1 and am only 20 weeks with #2 but have only gained 5.  I have been a little concerned too, but I was thinking maybe since I had not lost all the weight I gained from #1 I don't have to gain as much for this baby.  (I did not lose 10 lbs from #1) I was not overweight at the beginning of either pregnancy.  Did you lose all of your weight to begin with?  Just a theory :)|`|xGI9z01Maa	Ask the doctor.  If he is not having an issue then you don't need to have one.  <br>  <br>  Each person is different and each pregnancy is different.  My friend just had a baby and she did not gain much at all.  I gained 60 pounds with my first two and only about 40 with my third.  But as long as you are eating health then you should not be having any issues.  Most of my weight gain was the last three month.  <br>  <br>  But I have had friends that gain as little as 15 pound.  So it is all relative to you and your body.|`|xCoUvU8Laa	Dont let it worry you!!

That's your problem - talk with your ob/gyn and tell them you want prenatal vitamins WITHOUT IRON.|`|Sk6lrUeXaa	During pregnancy, I would say I would eat about 2 pieces of fruit a day and I would have at least 3 or 4 glasses of juice and I never had a problem with constipation.  And, oddly, prior to pregnancy, I normally had constipation and never ate fruit or drank much juice.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|QMxEjCpiaa	Buy several fiber granola bars from the grocery store. they are healthy for you and the baby and make a pretty good snack.

But honestly, drink more fluids.|`|TuRO6QHlaa	Fiber honey anything rich in fiber is going to help!|`|x68MbXVLaa	Like the others have already said - lots of fiber....so lots of fruit and veg.<br>  <br>  I have been suffering already (I am only 6 weeks) and I already eat lots of fruit and drink plenty of juice and water. My doctor just recommended more water.  I have been having a cup of prune nectar/juice (which I hate) and an activia yoghurt each day on top of at least 3 pieces of fruit......and this seems to be working.<br>  <br>  I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.|`|LkgrqlKXaa	For me, when I was pregnant with both children I would have constipation often. Sometimes fruit and juices would make it worse for me. Be careful though cuz when you're pregnant you can very easily get hemroids and they can be painful. I would say to drink more water.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	Eat fruits and vegetables that is high fiber. Also eat yogurt.

BcdbR6iSaa	My fiance has brown eyes, and I have green eyes. Our baby has beautiful blue eyes. She gets them from her grandpa I guess. He's the only one that has blue eyes. It's just a recessive gene, brown eyes are the dominant gene, but if you or your husband carry the recessive gene for blue eyes, then that's where it came from. It could have been from an ancestor that you don't know. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	all my family has dark brown hair and dark eyes, even olive skin tones.<br>  i have blue eyes, blonde hair and very light skin.

But sometimes they stay until 6 months+ & then change or it can take longer for them to change. But don't assume that she was cheating. Because all babies are different. And just because everyone in your family has brown or green eyes, dont mean that the baby will. There could be someone in the family who does have blue eyes & it got passed down to the baby.|`|zSABr7praa	My husbands mother is from portugal.  His father is a combination of many things.

He sticks out like a sore thumb, but no one thinks my mother in law had an affair.. gene's are recessive and my father in law's grandmother was from poland.<br>  <br>  My husband and I have green eyes, but we won't be shocked if the baby has blue or brown, as both those colors float around our family.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Recessive genes.  Each of her parents carries a recessive gene for blue eyes, bring them together and the odds are about 1 in 4 that their offspring will have blue eyes.  So obviously she hit that 1 in 4 odd.|`|kzyEuRroaa	it's possible for her to have blue eyes, input your info into the calculator below, it's pretty cool.|`|em8A42Bqaa	Maybe someone down the line.  I happen to be a very light shade of brown when both my parents and ALL my siblings are very dark.  My grandma was light, so we all assume I got it from her since I look like both my parents.|`|hQHWVRyTaa	It IS entirely possible, as blue eyes are a recessive gene. The fact that you state some of your family have green eyes shows that the gene is present but not being fully expressed. Both your sis and her hubby must have the recessive blue gene, and they managed to hook up in your niece.<br>  <br>  All of my brothers and I have blonde hair, yet my dad's is jet black and my mom has auburn, almost red, colored hair. Now my sis has the same hair color as my mom, but we boys obviously have a stronger expression of the blonde gene than my sis.<br>  <br>  Entirely possible.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	I'm not sure what you're looking for but yes recessive gene account for a lot of traits that we don't understand.  My oldest daughter looks very much like an Native American and that's because there is Native American heritage in my family but it was about 3 generations ago but since her father also has Native American heritage on his side we figure that she looks like her great great grandparents.  I know that I was faithful to her father.  You don't want to stir up trouble where there is none!!! Do some research on recessive genes in case it ever happens to you!  Would you want someone to think that you'd had an affair because your child looks like a great, great grandparent rather than someone from the current generation?|`|FtJUyn7jaa	The above answer is correct, if both parents had a recessive blue eye gene, the baby could easily have blue eyes. Also, some babies have blue eyes that eventually change into green eyes. Me and my sister both were born with blue eyes and now have green eyes.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	recessive genes. her husband must have one and she has one. it's totally possible. don't go assuming shes having an affair.|`|wFe7L1XJaa	It could be genes from way back in the day it doesnt necessarily mean she had an affair its all in the genes|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Yes it is possible.  My daughter shocked us by being born with bright red hair ( we are both blonde's and so is my son)  SHe got it from her great grandfather.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	...maybe her family (great grandparents) had blue eyes. you cannot just jump to conclusions.<br>  <br>  my family has all brown eyes but my great great grandpa had blue eyes and so did some of my cousins.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	All babies are born with blue eyes they go darker. My lil girl me and my bf both have brown eyes as well she has blue. Nothing to worry about|`|113FoyMFaa	you can carry the blue recessive gene if you have brown eyes.<br>  <br>  in this case, both your brother and sister in law are carrying that blue gene.  It's a 25% chance that they had a blue eyed baby.<br>  <br>  now, if it were the other way around, yes, I'd be questioning it.  2 blue eyed people will have a blue eyed baby.  you can't carry a dominant gene (brown) like you do a recessive one.  a blue eyed person ONLY has the blue gene, no matter what their parents, grandparents, etc had.<br>  <br>  njnic  IS CORRECT<br>  .|`|LY2LSzPJaa	My whole family has green eyes and my hubby's whole family has brown , my son and daughter were both born with Blue eyes , my sons turned green at around 2 but still have a little blue in there at age 3 , basically all green tho like mine. My daughters are still blue at 1 1/2 but there is a green tint in them , I know hers will change too. <br>  Like I said no one in my fam or his has blue eyes and my kids were born with them and I didnt have an affair. <br>  Plus even if there is 1 family memember from long long time ago had blue eyes it could have passed down to your neice.|`|G7tFsXWZaa	In each person's gene there are two parts.  There are two types of genes, dominant and recessive.  dominant is represented with a capital letter and recessive with lowercase. If you have a dominant part and a recessive (Bb) then your eyes will be brown because it is stronger than the recissive part. If your sister is Bb and your brother is Bb then their kid could have gotten both recessive parts... bb. both recessive parts would mean blue eyes and no affair. congrats on the neice :)|`|rQ04DXn7aa	Absolutely the baby can have blue eyes.  I have hazel (brown/green) and my husband is half Thai/half white and has brown eyes.  My daughter has blue eyes and light brown hair - and there was absolutely NO affair.  The same thing happened with my nephew - both my sister and my brother-in-law have brown eyes and my nephew has gorgeous sky blue eyes. Both my daughter and my nephew are almost two, so the eye color is going to stick. It's all about genetics...the recessive gene can come from several generations back.  In our case, my grandmother has blue eyes and my husband's family has blue eyes a generation or two back (his mother has green eyes).  I think I'd give your sister-in-law the benefit of the doubt.|`|AA11208683	she could of had an affair, you won't know that till you ask her. but your nieces parents good have a recessive gene of blue eyes, so even though they both have brown if one of them has the recessive gene for blue eyes, the baby could have blue eyes... just like the kids that are born with two different colored eyes... it all depends on the gene of the parents... hope this helps|`|UEAzzroAaa	Oh my good lord. For one, someone in your family doesn't have to have that color eyes for the baby to have them. I know a family with a little girl who has bleach blond hair and no one in her family does. Anything is possible. Why judge someones faithfulness based on eye color.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	somewhere in their genes. My eyes are pale blue, my moms were brown and my dads were green> But my grandmother (dads mom)  eyes were Blue. My brother and sisters eyes are both brown. And I know my mom didn't fool around, we all have her nose. Even my daughters.|`|29I3YjjPaa	WELL HOW OLD IS THE BABY...all babies are born with blue eyes my son's didn't change till he was like 7 months old. so no she may not have had an affair...the babies eyes could change my sons were very blue now there green, his father has dark brown too!|`|5ZdB5K6Raa	She could have got the blue eyes from a different family member the genetics could have been passed on to the child!|`|fPLv0QrSaa	Not based on that. Both parents could have been carrying the blue eye color gene. Blue eye color is recessive.|`|d3jtRA8caa	Depends if any of you have blue eyes somewhere down the line.|`|q1VbyCRuaa	YOU'RE ADOPTED!!!!|`|gJa6bKqraa	nooo she didnt do anything bad!!!maybe someone in her family has blue eyes...|`|mx7FINY8aa	genes can be passed down from many generations eg. if her grandad had blue eyes <br>  xx
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	I homeschool my children.<br>  <br>  When they were preschool age, I used some materials from A Beka.  However, we did not do a lot of formal curriculum in Preschool or Kindergarten ages.  At that age, most of their learning should be through play.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend the book "Ready for Kindergarten".  It has a lot of short lessons (and short is key with the attention span at that age) that are also fun.<br>  <br>  We also liked More than Magnets and the other books in that series, Story Stretchers (I think that was our favorite, it takes children's books and gives you ideas to encompass math, reading, arts and crafts, music and even snack into the stories).<br>  <br>  I also had a lot of books, such as Cheerios and Reese's, that used candy and other edibles to teach math skills.  It made it neat, fun (and tasty) for them and certainly kept their attention.<br>  <br>  You can go to the World Book Encyclopedia website, adn under the Parents tab look up the Typical Course of Study and you can print out an overview of what a child learns in each grade level (Preschool-12).<br>  <br>  You can also go to the A Beka book website and they have a Scope and Sequence booklet you can request for free (they might also have a downloadable version) that includes Nursery-Grade 12.  Request their free catalog while you are at it, and they have Curriculum shows going on this time of year where you can go and look through their materials before purchasing, to see if you like it and think it would work for your child.  Check their website to see if they will be in your area.<br>  <br>  No bashing homeschooling here.  It is the best!
7a0LdEt8aa	I understand where you are at, I'm kind of in a similar position. I think the reason that you feel this way is because you have so many kids, especially with the new one, you feel like your heart is bursting with love and having another would help 'absorb' some of it. One thing to consider, though, is that if you have more, more of your time is split between the kids, so that each new child, in a way, reduces the personal time you get to spend with each. So rather than expand your love to more kids, why not focus your desire in concentrating it on the ones you have. Easier said than done, I know.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I think lots of women get "baby fever" at some point.  Just don't act on it until you think long and hard about it.  Also discuss this with your husband and see if he would like another child.

kYkKcQJ2aa	Beware of the sciatic nerve, when the baby gets bigger it could be lying on that nerve and it is really hard to walk. I had this problem for only a month but I know of many moms that had this all of their pregnacy. Heartburn is going to come into play, I just took tums and stayed away from the foods that aggrevate the problem. Hopefully morning sickness will ease off. You will start going to the bathroom more through the day and night. Of course no alcohol or tobacco. Make sure you drink enough water to keep your stools soft, a big problem with pregnant woman are passing hard stools which give them anal fissures which is a tear right by the rectum. Do some research on that for sure because that takes up to months to cure. If you have not yet been to the website www.babycenter.com  is a great website that can inform you on anything that unexpectedly comes up, it's sort of like your 2nd mom. Good Luck!|`|g7wQij2Oaa	heartburn!!<br>  yuck.<br>  <br>  :)|`|mLbydsVIaa	i always have questions like that and when i do i go to<br>  www.babycenter.com<br>  or<br>  www.babyzone.com<br>  both really good places to go for info like that...it tells u everything<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck and hope this helps! :)|`|86c53f75c3002cf9b1c363c3367fd440aa	your baby weights roughly 10.5 ounces and from crown to rump it measeures 7.2 inches.your babies digestive system works  and you baby is swallowing in fluid o prepare for the outside world wich will cause hicups.<br>  in you ,you might exsperince occasional head aches,increase in appetite,mild swelling in ankles and feet,hands and face and you may start felling your baby move at the end of this month.|`|9puZ8W95aa	I am almost four months as well and my doctor told me I should be feeling more energetic and hungry and the nausea should be going away!
BcdbR6iSaa	Hmmm, the best way would be to tell him in person. <br>  If you don't want to be pregnant, you can get birth control without your mothers permission. And there are non latex condoms also. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|EAzyjftKaa	Just tell him because it took both of you to get you pregnant.

Especially for middle names, I wouldn't use a nickname as a middle name because it kind of sounds weird/doesn't flow very well.<br>  <br>  My favorites are Hayley Sofia for a girl and Ethan Thaddeus (even though I don't like Thaddeus) for a boy. My second favorites are Jana Madeleine and Nathaniel Zak. Good Luck!|`|49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	Where are you from?  I only ask because with the boys names in particular, there is a blend of both Scottish and Irish names and that influences my opinion ... I think people should name their kids with names that come from their own culture or one that they have strong family ties with, but not completely random names.<br>  <br>  Girl:<br>  Lyla Verity - like both names but not together, they don't flow<br>  Imogen Rosalie - like Imogen but think Rosalie is a bit old-fashioned<br>  Clarisse Theresa - noooooooo, reminds me of Claridge's<br>  Aisling Rosie (Ash-ling) - like Aisling but not Rosie as it's an abbreviation, Rose or Rosa would be nice though<br>  Daisy Penelope - it's okay<br>  Kristin Frannie - no, think Kristin is a bit dated and don't like Frannie as it's an abbreviation, Frances or Francine are nice though<br>  Melanie Jackie - no, think Melanie is a bit dated and don't like Jackie as it's an abbreviation, Jacqueline is nice though<br>  Asta Kenya - don't mind Asta, but wouldn't use Kenya if you're not African (refer to my comment about cultural-specific names)<br>  Ahava Mali - hmmmm, undecided<br>  Lois Violet - I don't like Lois, but Louise Violet could be nice<br>  Hayley Sofia - no, think Hayley is a bit dated, and it doesn't work with Sofia although I do like that name, but I would spell it Sophia to avoid it looking like it's Eastern European (again, not racist, just think people should use names from their own culture)<br>  Lydia Hannah - yes, that's nice<br>  Skye Elyssia - nice too<br>  Chelsie Fleur - I wouldn't choose it but I guess it's okay<br>  Carlotta-Mari Loretta - no; don't like double-barelled names if it involves a long name, and Carlotta and Loretta sound too similar to be used together<br>  Felicia Ann - yes<br>  Lacey Fliss - like Lacey but not sure about Fliss; it sounds like a pet rabbit<br>  Libby Mabel - no because Libby is short for Elizabeth and I don't like abbreviations; however Elizabeth Mabel with Libby as a nickname is nice<br>  Carly Lucy - the two "y" endings don't work together, but both names are nice<br>  Piper Carter - no, Carter sounds like a boy's name<br>  Piper Mari - yes<br>  Zoee Winifred - no, I like Zoe spelled with only one "e", and I don't think it matched Winifred<br>  Zoee Michelle - Zoe Michelle is nice (again one "e" in Zoe)<br>  Jana Madeleine - it's okay; wouldn't choose it but there's nothing wrong with it<br>  Philippa - yes<br>  <br>  Boy:<br>  Evert Liam - not sure about Evert, but Liam is nice<br>  Cameron Brendan - yes<br>  Karsten Jack - no, it's too similar to Kirsten so kids will make fun of him<br>  Aaron Martin - yes<br>  Reuben Martin - don't really like Reuben but Martin is okay<br>  Eoghan Kyle - don't like Eoghan but Kyle is okay<br>  Nathaniel Zak - I like Nathaniel but not Zak - first it's an abbreviation and second it's too modern to work with Nathaniel<br>  Leonard Freddie - again, I have a problem with abbreviations but Leonard is fine<br>  Samuel-Ben Christopher - no, double-barrelled is one thing for a girl, but I can't imagine any boy who would actually like a name like that.  Just Samuel Benjamin or Samuel Christopher would be nice<br>  Rhys Geoffrey - yes but only if you're Welsh<br>  Seth Caleb - no, both names are too trendy<br>  Ewan Henry - yes<br>  Tyrone Luke - yes<br>  Carwyn Pau - yes if you're Welsh<br>  Ethan Thaddeus - hmmm, not sure.  I do quite like Ethan but think it's a bit trendy.  I can't help but think that naming a kid Thaddeus is cruel!<br>  Ciaran Michael - yes if you're Irish<br>  Conlan Alex  - Conlan yes if you're Irish, Alex no but Alexander is nice<br>  Ceallach Patrick (Kay-lock) - yes if you're Irish<br>  Ardal Owen - it's okay<br>  Ross Kenneth - it's okay|`|61NKzPzMaa	Lyla Verity - I don't like it. Both names are not my style.<br>  Imogen Rosalie - Doesn't flow. Both names are beautiful though. How about Rosalie Imogen?<br>  Clarisse Theresa - Doesn't flow.<br>  Aisling Rosie - Aisling is lovely and I'm glad to spelt it correctly. Rosie is a nickname. How about Aisling Rose?<br>  Daisy Penelope - Doesn't flow. Daisy is very childish. Penelope is lovely. How about Penelope Daisy?<br>  Kristin Frannie - Don't like it. Kristen is lovely when spelled correctly. Frannie is horrible and sounds like a nickname.<br>  Melanie Jackie - Melanie is beautiful. Jackie is a nickname.<br>  Asta Kenya - Don't like it.<br>  Ahava Mali - Don't like it.<br>  Lois Violet - Ew. Violet is a horrible name. Vile Violet.<br>  Hayley Sofia - Beautiful name. Even better if Sophia was spelled correctly. Hayley Sophia and Sophia Hayley are beautiful names.<br>  Lydia Hannah - Nice name. I like it.<br>  Skye Elyssia - Don't like it.<br>  Chelsie Fleur - Trashy ugly spelling of Chelsea. Fleur isn't my type.<br>  Carlotta-Mari Loretta - Er not Carlotta and Loretta rhyme.<br>  Felicia Ann - Nice name. Felicia Anne is better though.<br>  Lacey Fliss - No. Fliss isn't a name.<br>  Libby Mabel - Libby is a nickname. How about Elizabeth Mabel?<br>  Carly Lucy - Carly is a nickname. Caroline Lucy is nice and even Caroline Lucille.<br>  Piper Carter - Carter is a masculine BOYS name.<br>  Piper Mari - Nice name but you forgot the e on Marie.<br>  Zoee Winifred - Trashy ugly spelling of Zoe.<br>  Zoee Michelle - Michelle Zoe would be better.<br>  Jana Madeleine - Doesn't flow. Madeleine Jana would be better.<br>  Philippa - Don't like it.<br>  <br>  Boy:<br>  Evert Liam - trashy spelling of Everett. Everett Liam and Liam Everett are lovely names.<br>  Cameron Brendan - The names are nice but it doesn't flow.<br>  Karsten Jack - Karsten isn't a name. Carson is though. Carson Jack?<br>  Aaron Martin - Nice name. Martin Aaron is also good.<br>  Reuben Martin - Nah doesn't flow but both names are nice.<br>  Eoghan Kyle - I like this name.<br>  Nathaniel Zak - Nathaniel Zack would be better even though Zack is a nickname.<br>  Leonard Freddie - Freddie is a nickname.<br>  Samuel-Ben Christopher - Too long. Ben is a nickname. How about Christopher Samuel or Benjamin Christopher or even Christopher Benjamin. Samuel Benjamin?<br>  Rhys Geoffrey - Doesn't flow. Geoffrey Rhys would be better.<br>  Seth Caleb - Doesn't flow. Caleb Seth is better.<br>  Ewan Henry - It's ok.<br>  Tyrone Luke - Lucas Tyrone would have been better.<br>  Carwyn Pau - No<br>  Ethan Thaddeus - Doesn't flow. Thaddeus Ethan is better.<br>  Ciaran Michael - Nice name but I think Michael Ciaran is better.<br>  Conlan Alex - No - Alex is a nickname.<br>  Ceallach Patrick (Kay-lock) - It's nice.

Whatever...<br>  <br>  You should consider talking to your doctor directly, and get her/his opinion of what you should do.

NbJbZXtGaa	Whatever the test shows today would not be accurate. You HAVE to read it within ten minutes to get an accurate result.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	The doctor's test wasn't using your first morning urine.  If the home test you took showed pregnant, you probably are.  Wait a few days and do one more to be sure.|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	I've seen those evaporation lines only when I dig the test out of the trash can.  <br>  <br>  I'd wait another day or two and then do the following:<br>  <br>  Pee in a dixie cup 1st thing in the AM.  Then dip the test into the cup.  This way you have more control over how much pee gets on the test and your pee will have more of the pregnancy hormones in it if you are pregnant.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  <br>  <br>  FYI:<br>  "Once you discontinue the use of birth control, and try to become pregnant:<br>  <br>  <br>  25 in the first month <br>  60 in six months <br>  75 in nine months <br>  80 in twelve months <br>  90 in eighteen months" <br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/od/gettingpregnant/qt/gettingpregnant.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.about.com/od/gettingpre...</a>

Missing 3 pills can cause spotting. By three days your body is losing all the hormones from the pills and so it thinks period time. I am not saying you are not pregnant for sure but be more careful. And the big thing to remember is that you cannot triple up on the 3 missed pills to fix your mistake. It will not work. You can only do that with 1 missed pill. If your period never starts, then take a test. And if you're extremely, extremely worried go to the doctor and have an exam.|`|PTv7k1Hlaa	i am a full time nurse ages 32 , this is the sign of pregnancy darling.<br>  <br>  talk to your GP or nurse, as you might have aids.|`|WYonIR7Zaa	well yes that is a sign of pregnancy, take a test.<br>  good luck<br>  Bri x|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	Just go to the pharmacy and buy a pregnancy test and if you're not you can come back and buy some comdoms, please, before you get infected with some STD|`|7zPl9rIxaa	ur prob not preg ur body is probaly just adjusting to the pill but take test any way

I know what you mean about things feeling differently from pg to pg, but I'll tell you what everyone says to me and what I've read about a million times.....every pregnancy is different.  I know that's not a lot of comfort, but it may help a bit to try to keep that in mind and maybe try not to compare your previous pregnancies.  Definitely call your OB's office though.  Let them know your concerns and maybe insist they see you if only to put your mind at ease.  We have enough to worry about being pregnant!  Good luck.  If it comforts you at all, my discharge is sometimes more watery at times than at others too.  Gross, but true.|`|ld14iRCeaa	if u are leaking u need to get to the doctors quickly. they say with every baby u can feel things more intensely, i felt like my second child was going to just fall out the whole time. turns out she never  even dropped till i was induced. lol hang in there. but i would definitely at least call your doctor:) good luck|`|bf6fb0f4caadf24cfa826edc2cc32d3baa	definitely get it checked out. it is not worth the risk of not going.

S5n5Za78aa	well how many days is your cycle if its 25day cycles then you should be able to test now technically your AF would have been due on 3/1 but thats if you know how many days are in your cycle from a month to month basis <br>  good luck|`|M3xE3V2Baa	?? NO, I think it is just the right amount of time to take a test..I would just go take one now...what could it hurt. But then again Im a POAS addict, so I buy in bulk..lol??|`|aEpPt9koaa	The most accurate time to take a pregnancy test is two weeks after a missed period so I would wait til the end of March and take a test then.
Xu5BtID1aa	They told me that it will be 1 full year before they do anything, but they will want her to chart EVERYTHING!! If she can chart when yall do the baby making, when her periods are and when she should be ovulating, the doc. can give y'all some advice! I am going on May 29 for my doc. and I have been charting since Dec.! I hope it works out for both of us!!! GOOD LUCK, AND GOD BLESS!!!!!!!!|`|S5n5Za78aa	doctors really want you too wait atleast a year of ttc with this method b4 seeing a fertility specialist <br>  you should look into the book (taking charge of your fertility) you can prob get it from library and start charting your temps  on fertilityfriend.com but the book will teach you everything as far as pinpointing ovulation<br>  or you can wait for ovulation which can occur anywhere from 10-24 days after the first day of you period (fertile period ) its different for everyone and start using ovulation predictor kits till you get a positive between the days i just mentioned and go from there  but you have to make sure whatever you do your having sex on the RIGHT days it can get tricky!! good luck|`|OrzXoAywaa	i would love to give you some advice...but first of all,,i need to know both you and your partner age? have you both have child before? or any problem with your family or her family having problem of having children? one thing i have learn it that for NORMAL couple, it could take more than a year of trying ( meaning doing everything right..temp, ovulation,...etc..<br>  Be Patience!! God bless!|`|u1lcZZYfaa	Well first off I don't know how long you've been trying but if its less than a year I wouldn't go to the doctor. My husband and I tried for 11 months and it finally happened. We did every position too lol! I think what finally did it was when I elevated my legs and hips after making love. But I'm not sure. Its worth a shot though!
AA11099527	I have the same problem sometimes. I do work but not often at all. I get out maybe 5 times a month for work. I still need more adult interaction. I try to go to the public library or even going to walmart with my daughter is better than sitting at home. It is complety normal.|`|d5479b73829d5fa0818d9eec2850a058aa	I was a primary school teacher before I was a SAHM so I dont crave adult interaction that much.  I try to get my two toddlers out and about as much as possible, walks to the park, swimming, cycling, trips to the shops, etc.|`|yJ7X3oEdaa	I'm in play groups, mops ( mother of preschoolers) and go to my library for story time!|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I never felt that way, however I work at home as an artist/muralist also. Plus now that my kids are 10, 9, 7 we do sports all year around, so I have lots of interaction.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	nope, cause its called playdates, mops and going to the park, get out and do stuff and meet others
s4LWmcTjaa	I think most of us are representatives of normal, reasonable parents in general.  I think I am a pretty good representative of most parents in my community (meaning in my immediate neighborhood).  We all have different opinions and we might have different ways of raising our kids, but we have the same general goal: Raising our kids to be happy. respectful individuals.  <br>  <br>  I really enjoy debates and intelligent discussion on this board (notice I said *intelligent discussion, lol).  I really appreciate the reasonable people who can agree to disagree on some issues and finding common ground with others as well.<br>  <br>  A lot of parents in my community are very similar to me or better.  Of course there is the other side of town that has some poor examples of parents, but everyone has those.  Thanks.  Interesting question :)|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I'm guessing so, yes.  <br>  <br>  Different?  More outspoken behind a computer screen|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Not really.  I think they are representative of parents who like to talk abour parenting, who like to argue or who just like getting all dramatic on the internet.  <br>  <br>  In real life, I'm afraid, there are so many more parents who just don't even think that parenting is something that people would discuss or think about - it's just something that you have to put up with after having sex.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	The majority of parents in my area, are either married, or divorced with joint custody. Not too many single moms left to fend on their own.  We are all very charitable and helpful to the needs of our community and each other.  Our area is really one big family.  The concentration is on sports and academics at a young age.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	A pretty good representation. I would not have known that 10 years ago. My son tells me what goes on behind some of these closed doors. I use to think he made some of it up. I thought things had changed. I was wrong. I see parents drinking and driving, smoking dope, refusing to support their kids, and some driving them so hard it burns them up. Parents put on a good front however and a lot of things you would never guess.|`|4gZYucHMaa	On here I believe there are a lot of fakers who only wish they were half as good as they brag.<br>  <br>  The people I know, make mistakes and aren't afraid to admit them. I like that, it's human.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Hmm, this is a hard one. There is much diversity on this board. I'm going to have to say that I can't say that most parents are like the ones on this board, though some are. I'm talking in terms of discipline, marital status, social status, and so on. <br>  <br>  Some parents in my community are just like the ones that I like answering and getting answers from on this board, but there are others in my community that I'd not even ask or answer a question on a board like this, if i knew it was them! There is diversity in my community as well in terms of marital status, social status, and so on!<br>  <br>  There are some parents in my community, that allow their children to do what ever they please, not many, but a few.|`|s6emVQleaa	I think there is probably a good mix of everything on here.  It's going to be skewed towards those of us that waste too much time on the internet:), but if you exclude the obvious trolls the rest are a good mix.  As far as the parents I associate with in my friendships- there isn't a lot of diversity so I can't speak for my community.  Most of them were raised like I was (parents who are still married, raised in a church, conservative, most have college degrees, etc) and we probably tend to raise our kids the same as well.  That is part of why I enjoy coming on here.  Even if I don't always agree with every position, I like to understand other perspectives that are out there.|`|j2mRop0laa	I think some of them are. A lot of my contacts seem pretty *normal* in terms of parents, in general, that I know. <br>  <br>  Some things seem very amplified. For example, I had people make comments on the fact that I let my kids have binki's and bottles till they were 4, but no one actually acted like "Oh my god- I don't BELIEVE in that!" lol<br>  <br>  I think people that frequent the board are more opinionated on certain topics than parents that I know.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i think they are diverse, interesting, strange, people i wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley, people who would have a blast hanging out, bizarre, judgmental, kind and considerate.<br>  <br>  a little bit of everything<br>  <br>  most people i know aren't as um well vocal in their dislikes.|`|eu6UQElYaa	In my community most of the mothers are your typical suburban "soccer mom" driving around in their SUV's.   I'm thinking the moms on here are a much more diverse group.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	If the parents I knew in real life were half as perfect as the parents on here appear to be, we'd live in a much nicer world.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	dysfunction junction|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Yeah, I guess they are.  Diverse an interesting....that's my community!;-)<br>  <br>  How about you?  What do you think?|`|xp4mhkqgaa	I think that most parents on here are very different to the ones in my community, but a lot of that's probably due to the fact that I'm in a different country.  <br>  <br>  I've noticed that a lot of the parents here tend to be a lot more protective over their children.  Where I live, a lot of the parents give their children a lot more freedom, and they're a lot more independent from a younger age.  We don't baby them up until they're 18, then suddenly expect them to know how to fend for themselves.  <br>  <br>  I also find that there's more narrow mindedness about issues such as, single parents, unmarried parents, abortion etc.  They also seem a lot more religious, too.  <br>  <br>  Most of the parents that I know don't judge others so much.  They seem to be more open minded, and realise that age, marital status, and financial status, doesn't determine whether you're a good parent or not.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I may get attacked for this one but oh well.<br>  <br>  I think that there a number of people on here who agree to disagree, have intelligent answers, and remind me of people I come across in my everyday life.  That's not the majority though.<br>  <br>  I find people to be extremely immature about things that should be joked about on this site.  There are a lot of ignorant people who come on this board. Not that I haven't met some goofballs but some of the things that are said on here blow my mind.<br>  <br>  I think sitting behind a computer screen "hiding" can really bring out the negative nasty ridiculous side of some people.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	not really, most of us here are social recluses who have no real life<br>  well, except for me, and you, and all the people who aren't trolls :)<br>  i think that im sort of a representative of my community, quite a few conservative, christian, middle class, WAHD's here, like me, yay<br>  but totaly not all parents in general,|`|ba91f39977984e4e7308c5858b127eeeaa	no, not at all. The moms on here are kinda se la vie type. The ones I'm around all day are supermom freaks who look like they never gave birth. Which is great cuz that just makes me want to be like that too.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	no, most of the women in my neighborhood are  married, stay at home moms just like me. I feel alot of people on this board single with kids rather then the people I associate with outside of the internet|`|rNvXWMOMaa	not at all...
vue9NOhYaa	Your baby is perfectly normal.  MANY 2 1/2 month olds are still nursing every 3 hours around the clock. They have tiny tummies and need to eat often.<br>  <br>  She is far too young for rice cereal (you need to wait at LEAST another couple of months, and prerably 3-4 months to begin solids. She can't digest rice cereal or eat from spoon yet.<br>  <br>  If you want to try and get her to sleep a bit longer, you might try nursing more often during the day.  Figure that a baby this age needs around 8-10 feeds a day, so if she isn't getting them during the day, she will need them at night.|`|tShDXmgbaa	My grandson has been getting cereal bottles since he was 2 weeks old.  He will be 2 months old March 5th and right now he gets a 3 1/2 oz. milk bottle with 2 tablespoons of single grain rice cereal at a rate of 3 times a day (morning, noon & bedtime).  All other bottles during the day are just milk and the amount of milk during those feedings are 4 oz.  He sleeps better during naps and at nite. He no longer eats his fist nor does he cry constantly for a bottle. He sleeps so good at nite..sometimes my daughter has to get him up for a  bottle and back to sleep he goes.|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	at 11 weeks that is perfectly normal & does not indicate that she needs rice - its far far too early for that.<br>  <br>  My friends 5 month old still wakes frequently at night, it might just be your babies routine. <br>  <br>  My son is 7 months and still night feeds - he also has 3 solid meals a day so hunger isn't an issue.|`|mbu5LD02aa	breast feeding IS VERY GOOD FOR THE BABY THATS WHATS WRONG WITH PARENTS THESE DAYS THEY DONT BREAST FEED THEY USE FORULA.|`|1hciyvKdaa	The rationale is about babies nutrition,  is always about, what their stomach is developmentally ready to handle and nothing else. So following baby feeding guidlines makes digestion easier on their stomachs, less gas, less food allergies now or later in life. yes at the appropriate time rice cereal diluted with breast milk will help baby feel fuller, the rice cereal, does not replace the milk nutrition lost by filling up before thier full. Encouraging more milk production by drinking more and eating better, and good feeding patters is way more beneficial. Babies dont like to sleep, its thier job right now, to starve you of sleep and sanity, its just how it is hun. If you expect that to be the norm, your better prepared for dealing with it.  Oh and one more thing, the ratinale of a baby breast fed wont over eat as a bottle fed, is nonsense, from some reason some moms feel the need to make up stories to get other moms to breastfeed, and they dont need to do that, we all know its healthier some moms want to and some dont, or cant. So anyhow, good luck on that, get and follow the rules of adding foods, the types the amounts etc etc etc, to have a healthy start for your new little bundle of joy. A baby packed with cereal sleeping is not what parenting is about, it is true its a blessing when they can eat more, but the guilt will haunt you if you feed it before its ready for it.|`|giCUEYsJaa	Yes you can supplement your baby girl with rice cereal at age 3 months.<br>  <br>  Rice is the safest first food to introduce to an infant.<br>  <br>  I recommend you mix the rice cereal with your breat milk and feed her around your normal dinner hour.  <br>  <br>  If you are still concerned - talk with her pediatrician.  But I'm sure he/she will say it's okay.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your pink bundle of joy!|`|6e72fe5eaebe0f66961aa766d452c09faa	in my experience you need to wait until she is 4months to give baby rice. maybe you could try feeding her every 2 hours before bed say 6pm 8pm 10pm then 11pm and bed this may help her sleep a bit better the only other thing i can think of but i dont think you will like it is maybe try giving her a hungry baby formula feed before bed but keep her other feeds as breast milk. sorry if it dont help much but its the only things i can think of good luck|`|IDS64Eh8aa	Rice cereal is not needed at any age and does not guarantee longer sleep, my daughter will be 8 months soon, she eats normal food and still wakes up at least twice for a breastfeed|`|955YoHvVaa	You fall under the category entitled "unlucky"..there are quite a few babies that don't sleep through the night heck my daughter still isn't and shes 14 months old! Babies that age sleep for a short time, wake up, feed, sleep again..don't force it..they will sleep through the night when they are ready. Three months is awful early for rice cereal..I gave it to my daughter at 5 months and she couldn't digest it and would get constipated and we just ended up avoiding it even after she could have it..just get up and feed your baby if she wakes up...it's not like they won't sleep through the night for the next 18 years.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	Your friend couldn't be any more wrong, if your baby is gaining weight than she is getting plenty of milk from you. It is also 100% normal for her to still be waking every 3 hours.<br>  Rice is a starch, and just as easily digested it will NOT help her sleep longer at night..trust me..I know..my daughter didnt sleep through the night until 6.5 months and she was on solids way before that (at 5 months).<br>  <br>  The reason you do not want to start solids at 11 weeks old is b/c your baby does not yet have the right digestive enzymes to break down solids...this is developed sometime after 4 months but closer to 6 months. If you do push the rice, youll be forcing her little body break down solids when its not ready.<br>  <br>  Give your baby time..she WILL sleep longer stretches when shes ready!! Night waking is a normal part of having a newborn..and in the future..never compare babies!!|`|VKgD1K3baa	Honestly, I would not feed your baby rice cereal just to get her to sleep longer as she is only 3 months. Plus, feeding her rice cereal doesn't guarantee anything - My baby is 6 months, breastfed, on solids, and is up more often than your baby. He has gone through the night a few times before he was on solids so I don't think the rice is needed. How often do you feed her during the day? Maybe if you upped the amount of nursing sessions she wouldn't want to eat as much at night. But still, she is only 11 weeks old, give it some time and try to enjoy this short time with her.|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	Your friend is ignorant but I am appalled that yher midwife told her it was fine to give her son rice at three months old. <br>  <br>  Your baby's gut is very permeable at this age.  The AAP reccommends nothing but breastmilk before 6 months. <br>  <br>  Waking every three hours is nothing.  My four month old still wakes at least every two hours during the night to nurse. <br>  <br>  Breastfed babies won't over eat only at the breast.  It has nothing to do with other foods.  <br>  <br>  You feed your daughter when she wants it.  That's the way breastfeeding works.  The actual natural pattern of breastfeeding, when unencumbered by our cultural expectations and views is several times an hour during the day and several times through the night.  Much more often than every two to three hours.  Prolactin production actually is very dependent on nursing sessions at least every two hours in order to maintain a good milk supply.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/solids-when.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  <br>  No, you cannot make up the rice with expressed milk.  Everyone here who is telling you it's ok to feed an 11 week old rice is basing assumptions on a 60 year old belief.  It's actually hazardous to your infant's health.  <br>  <br>  The !Kung bushpeople of Africa nurse their infants all through the night (not four hours!  How I wish my four month old would go four hours!) and at least four times an hour.  What you are experiencing is a walk in the park.|`|hFoYmSgqaa	if she is gaining weight then leave well enough alone until she is four months she will only take what she needs when she needs it. my baby is formula feed not by choice and at fifteen weeks is o solids as the extra hungry milk was not enough but he was a large baby at birth and has been onsoilds for about six weeks. he stopped gaing weight but was not losing it had not ill etc so we were advised to start him on solids i.e baby rice. when she is four months express some milk and mix it with baby rice and give her that as well. you may find that adding in some formula will help to fill her up but do speak to you midwife/health visitor before you do anything. if she is content then wait for as long as possible, my son does not over eat and has never over eaten, on the box of formula it tell how many bottles, how many ounces of formula the baby is supposed to have per feed at either weight or age (we have found the weight amount actually is the best amount to go with else we were up every two-three hours.|`|iAQKD2YBaa	I started the baby rice just before 4 months and it did nothing. <br>  <br>  I was recommended not to use the rice until at least 6 months as the baby's digestive system is not able to fully work at this age, but they sell the rice for 4 month old so I tried it.  It did nothing to help my son with his sleep, he actually started waking more at night once I started him on the rice during the day and went from 12 hour sleeps at 4 months to waking 3 to 5 hourly for a bottle (he still does this at 10 months of age).<br>  <br>  It is a tough call, but personally, if I had it to do again I don't think I would give it to my son again. <br>  <br>  I found that he just like plain water with his rice instead of formula.|`|ZzyEhSB1aa	I breast fed my son for a very long while. I had a similar problem, I spoke to my health visitor and I was encouraged to eat more richer foods because my milk was not sufficient for my son.<br>  I did this and it still was not enough but my son was the correct weight for his age.<br>  I then started giving him solids - although I advised to give him baby rice, I used to give him a little bit of mashed avocado instead because it is the most nutritious fruit you can eat.<br>  His weight and health improved.<br>  <br>  All the best and well done for breasfeeding your baby - you are giving your child the best start in life|`|kBVCZK0Haa	i'm not positive but almost sure you can use breast milk for rice. a friend of mine put her breast milk in her daughters cereal.|`|c9NuCZnaaa	I've heard some women giving their kids baby rice as early as just a couple of weeks old. they say that at about 4 months you can start giving small amounts of baby rice so to start early i wouldn't see the problem. she would only need a small amount just before bed. see if it works and if it does, carry on until 4 months then start giving her a little more during the day too. <br>  Though i would also like to add that...sometimes babies do just wake up and cry. it's what they do. and sometimes theres no reason for it and all you can do is wait it out and sleep whenever you can. My son did this for a while though he was a little bit older. I think all you can do is a bit of trial and error. If the giving some baby rice before bed works, go for it as it's doing no harm. but otherwise you'll just have to suffer! sounds harsh i know!!<br>  Good luck|`|uprGdkTsaa	While breast feeding it is best not to try and get the baby to feel full longer, because this will slow down your milk production. However a bottle of formula would also fill your daughter for longer than breast milk.<br>  <br>  Formula is easier to digest than rice and giving a bottle (or cup) at night might get you a bit more rest.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you decide to do x|`|z6IekuwSaa	I haven't read other people's answers yet so if I repeat I'm sorry. First off good for you for breastfeeding! It IS best. I love it. Yes you can mix breastmilk with cereal. That's actually the only way my daughter will eat it. My Mom also suggested giving cereal to my daughter in a bottle to help her sleep at night. I asked her pediatrician about it. He said it was a big no no since she was healthy and didn't need extra weight. It is just empty calories. The reason you start out giving it to babies by spoon is just to teach them how to eat since it uses a different tounge motion. Also he said that it would not help with sleeping that it is a myth. The length of time they sleep at night actually has nothing to do with if they are hungry or not. It is just whether they are able to soothe themselves back to sleep. You can help this by putting him in his crib when he is drowsy for naps and bedtime. Making him fall asleep on his own. Once my doc told me this she learned, and I got to sleep. A real life saver. Anywho, I wish you the best of luck!
UghJ0XROaa	Call me crazy, but there are no food allergies in either me or my husband's family, so i was a bit more lax about the food guidelines than i should have been. I was giving Gabriella's baby food with strawberries in it around 6 months, around 9 months i was told by the doctor to explore different tastes and textures with her. She had everything but shellfish by the time she was 2. She was eating minimal amounts of peanut butter on bread at 9 months, fresh cut up strawberries, cheese, yogurts pretty much anything. I was paranoid about shellfish though, but now she eats that too and she has no allergic reactions.|`|siDcjgJCaa	I was never super super caution when it came to food with Sophie especially if there was no history of allergy in our family. I mean I was carful but not overly cautious. <br>  <br>  She has had eggs (with the egg whites) scrambled ... at 7 1/2 months, I gave her a taste of a strawberry last night - she is currently 8 months. I read an article last week that said its ok to introduce peanut butter as early as 8 months.. so she is gonna try some of that. No nuts yet because of the choking hazard.. the only thing I am waiting until 12 months is cow's milk...|`|5rqVTOzmaa	I gave Aaron eggs at 10 months but he did not like them. He will now eat eggs only if they are hard boiled, he doesn't like scrambled or fried eggs. He has not tried peanut butter yet, only because that salmonella outbreak scared the heck out of me and I'm paranoid. He will be 14 months next week.|`|heDtLdz5aa	at 9 months my doctor gave me the okay to give evan eggs..scrambled or hardboiled....he will be 16 months tommorow and still has not had any peanutbutter...i was planning on giving it to him at 18 months...but with the scare of peanutbutter i am a little nervous and not sure if i will...|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I was given the OK from my doctor to try egg yolks when my son turned 7 months.  I haven't yet because he doesn't seem ready for table food. When he is ready, we'll try it and see how he likes it.   He is 9 months now...I'm hoping in the next few weeks he'll start wanting to eat what I offer him lol|`|723QHuicaa	I did not know that strawberry were a biggie - i gave Soph strawberrys at 7m and she was totally fine with them. I knew not to give lots of different fruits / veg in one week and only to introduce them one at a time.<br>  <br>  Eggs - 9m, always hard boiled, or scrambled, never runny.<br>  <br>  Peanut butter - not something we buy anyway.<br>  <br>  <br>  **** Ah thanks, She was sitting on my knee and she spotted daddy with cheese and went 'ooooohhhhh' and I snapped her!
fPFXJr3eaa	Most don't.  A decision is when person can decide what they want to do for themselves after they have been presented all the facts and consequences.  Most mothers who are separated from their babies (and I said most not all), do so unwillingly.  Many are coerced and forced into adoption, some have their children taken (yes it actually does happen), some are duped by agencies.<br>  <br>  The view of the mother who loses her child by adoption is so warped.  Most are seen as selfish or cruel once they finish the transaction, but whilst pregnant they are told they are unselfish and giving a couple a beautiful gift.  The general public seem to have a view of a mother who has lost her child as a 16 year old who is incapable of caring for her child. Not so.  A woman who is vulnerable, isolated and afraid is a very easy target whatever their age.<br>  <br>  For the few who do it willingly, they do it because they somehow believe their child is going to better off without them.<br>  <br>  In this case, it seems CPS may have been involved and her children were removed.  If her children went into Foster care, they could have been adopted from there.  I can't tell you much else without more facts of the case.|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	Because they are unable to care for them. Some people are private and feel it is an invasion of privacy if someone asks personal questions. In my opinion it is very rude to ask those types of questions unless the subject has been brought up by the other party.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	Many first mothers are extremely traumatized by the relinquishment of their child/children. They are also taught to never speak of the child. That could be one of the reasons, or perhaps she thought it was none of your business.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Your profile says you are 25.  Surely you know reasons why people put their children up for adoption.  Individual reasons are none of your business.  This subject is best left out of the ears of nosy children.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Maybe she didn't want to explain herself to a child. It is really her personal business and she doesn't owe anyone any explanations. Maybe it is a painful thing for her to talk or think about.|`|JP04HX6maa	Because they don't often have support or the resources necessary to "defend" themselves.<br>  <br>  And by "defend", I mean against adoption agencies, against social workers, and against the courts.|`|AA12127693	It's not nor wasn't her story to tell - the story should be told by the children that were adopted.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	I'm confused. Did she give her kids up for adoption or did she adopt her kids? And why would you ask where her partner is? <br>  <br>  She may not have answered your questions because you were 9 or 10 and therefore too young to understand the complexities of the situation. Then again, she probably didn't answer because you're a nosy little kid and it's her personal business!|`|jeYi7APraa	people put their children up for adoption for many reason...<br>  like if they lose their job and no longer have the funds to take care of them, If they are in an abusive relationship and dosent want the child to get hurt, or if they are 13 and are a kid themself...many many reasons.|`|VWWowNiMaa	they give the baby up cuz they probably cant afford it or cant do take care of it at teenage years|`|kmGW34unaa	because they were mistakes|`|SLph9RX6aa	maybe she lost acourt custody case<br>  maybe the husband kidnaped them<br>  maybe its nothing to do with you|`|yzIB8Cbiaa	Because they can't adequately care for them.|`|AA10186411	That was a very personal question for you to ask her.  She probably regrets doing it, but felt it was in the best interest of her children.|`|oojO4WAraa	It was none of your business why she adopted them.  She did not owe you an explanation.  You were very nosy asking her that.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	She probably couldn't care for them in some way. I'm sure she had a good reason. It was probably hard on her and that's why she didn't want to talk about it.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Its one think liking children and working with them, bringing them up is a whole different story.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Caring,<br>  <br>  Well, you've certainly been scolded enough for being a precocious child!<br>  (Kids ask questions. That's how they learn. Sheesh. As if kids know how touchy, messy and complicated adoption is without living with it!? 'Cause we brilliant adults think they "can't understand" or gloss it over. How many people discuss adoption with their children unless they have a personal reason?! Treating things like taboo subjects lead to ignorance.)<br>  <br>  While I certainly cannot answer for why your former acquaintance's children were adopted (everybody has their own story) I CAN tell you that the biggest reasons for surrendering a child are age, marital status and finances (or a combination of one or more reasons). Please note that all of these things are temporary issues and in most cases are poor reasons to surrender a child but are consistently used to make women feel as if the "have no choice". When expectant parents are not given support and education, adoption often becomes "a permanent solution to a temporary problem" and often results in permanent issues for the relinquishing parent(s) and/or the child.<br>  <br>  Other reasons can be:<br>  *Coercion or pressure from partner, family, friends, agencies etc. (Being convinced that they are an unworthy parent.)<br>  *Medical Reasons (Parent(s) unable to care for the child due to medical issues with either the parent(s) or the child.) <br>  *Forced Adoption (Child Services/DSS/CPS/DCFS/DYFS/ETC/)<br>  *Education/Career choices (believing that parenting would preclude advancement of education or career or that the child will have "better opportunities with other caretakers.)<br>  *Charity (Misguided attempts to help the childless.)<br>  *Mental/Emotional Problems (Some people are not willing or capable of parenting due to mental illness or emotional issues that prevent them from being a proper parent.)<br>  *Religious and Political Beliefs (Religious or political beliefs that prevent termination of an unwanted pregnancy.)<br>  *Government Policy (The one child policy in China, anti-abortion laws, etc.)<br>  *Lack of Knowledge (Not knowing the truth about adoption or its issues, effects, laws, etc.)<br>  *Drug Abuse (Drugs make people do stupid things.)<br>  <br>  There are more, but I think I hit the big ones. <br>  <br>  Adoption is often an unnecessary tragedy for the relinquishing parent(s) and many adoptees as well. Most of the reasons are ones that could be overcome with the proper support. Relinquishing parents are often "shamed into silence" and struggle with terrible grief and guilt surrounding their children's adoptions. It is only in the last 15 years or so that these women (and men) have really begun to speak out about their experiences and attempt to educate others and overcome the stigma and discrimination that comes with the ugly title of "birthparent". (Thank the industry for this lovely term which was invented to help psychologically separate parents and their offspring.)<br>  <br>  As you are now 22 and asked this of your former acquaintance when you were 9 or 10 and she had relinquished prior to your knowing her, chances that she has felt shamed, isolation, grief and unable to share her experiences are even greater. My best friend's mother is also a first mom. She has never spoken of her experiences to anyone but my friend and me. She has suffered tremendously and alone for a long time and has a very hard time talking about her other daughter. I am helping her see that it is ok for her to share her pain and that she is NOT the horrible person she believes herself to be.<br>  <br>  I hope that your former acquaintance has found some peace and perhaps her voice and I hope that you will extend your friendship and acceptance to her again should you ever have the opportunity.
s4LWmcTjaa	I knew it would be difficult.  But there are times when I say "I REALLY never expected this!"<br>  <br>  Some parts are easier than I first thought and other parts are harder than I originally believed.  But I adjust and find ways to make it work and learn along the way.<br>  <br>  Hopefully the teen years are not the kind of battle I experienced growing up.  I was a very strong willed teenager...... am I doomed to have strong willed teens too? :)<br>  <br>  Good thing God is there and can give me peace of mind and guidance.  I don't know what I'd do without Him (seriously).|`|ANHsv4ENaa	So much easier. I read a lot of books that had women saying how they were always tired and never got to sleep and they lost themselves and never took a break. They never got help and felt overwhelmed. I was afraid that was motherhood. It was inevitable. Lol. It's really pretty cake. Sure it has it's problems but all in all it's pretty easy to do if you just flow and don't force. If I forced my son to eat solids at six months and forced him to sleep in his crib and obsessed about his development all the time sure it would be hard. I'm very laid back and it's not hard to be a parent if you pay attention to your child and your instincts. As he gets older I'm sure there will be new challenges but I don't see it suddenly becoming a really hard thing just to be his mom.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	both.  the routine, day-to-day parts of it were harder than i expected before having kids, but has become easier than i feared in that first year or two of seeing what i had gotten myself into.<br>  <br>  but the overall experience of it is harder, not in terms of the packing of lunchboxes and fixing of booboos and finding of lost socks, but in terms of taking responsibility for another person's existence.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Both :-)  <br>  <br>  It's definitely more interesting & fascinating than I thought it would be.|`|AA11210211	In some respects it is harder than I though,but hey what doesn't kill you makes you stronger right...|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Easier It just sorta happens.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Neither; it has it's good days and bad ones. Right now we're going through the transition from diapers to potty training and it's pretty tough (especially when your child pees right in front of the toilet and then says mommy i peed lol). I'm just getting used to the idea of having two, so juggling them is pretty okay. So far I've had about 2 tough days but it won't break me. I'll just say parenting is rewarding adventure.|`|AA10186411	A little of both if that makes sense.  I definitely wasn't prepared for the endless amounts of vomit and poop.  The only experience I had with a baby was my niece, and she was a child who rarely ever got sick.  I think I saw her throw up like once.  My daughter has severe reflux and asthma, and I think she's thrown up closer to a million times!  My niece is just about as 'normal" and you can get, and my daughter is far from that...she has alot of health issues and developmental issues.  As for it being easier, I really feared I wouldn't feel like a mom, and I wouldn't be a very good one.  But I was definitely wrong!|`|NuvKPl3naa	for me they were given to me, no one at a time. i went from none to 7 at once in 6 months. now that we have adopted 4 i have to say its harder than i thought. trying to keep them healthy, safe, teaching them about life, discipline, loving them so much, worrying all the time, i can go on and on. and this is forever. BUT i would never trade it for the world.|`|prqrQcd1aa	About the same with me, sometimes easier sometimes harder, depending on what kind of day we are all having honestly!<br>  I've been helping to raise kids since i was about 11 years old though, so I kind of had a big taste of it before I was even a parent!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	it was so easy - before i had kids.  i never even imagined some of the stuff that i do now.  (my toilet question)  so much easier in my mind than in practice.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	It is the hardest thing I have ever done but in the same token: It is the most rewarding thing I ever done as well.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Well my baby is only 7 months and so far it has been easier but I have a feeling it will soon be harder.|`|GqsLNUE8aa	I never really thought the whole thing through prior hand.:)|`|nfzQkvqraa	As far as bonding with them, taking care of their basic needs, being actively involved in their schooling I think it's easier.<br>  <br>  When I think ahead (which I rarely do) about the teenage years and their adulthood when I'll have lost any control I have been able to keep I think it will be much harder.  I think a lot of people think about parenting and imagine babies, toddlers, little league baseball whatever.  Once a parent always a parent.  I'm always going to have to make decisions based on my kids choices in life.  Even when they're adults.  That will be much more difficult for me I think.|`|M1KYxcvSaa	So much harder.  No one can prepare you for how enmeshed in another person's life you become.  I mean, I love my parents and husband and other people, and I care about what happens in their lives.  But ultimately they are all adults and can take care of themselves.  When you have a child, you are responsible for every. little. detail. of their lives.  With babies, you are the one one who makes sure they eat and poop and if they have a tummy ache or need a bath.....  As your kids get older, you are responsible for teaching them character development, how to be responsible citizens of the world, who to trust and how to know when not to trust someone.  You make sure their health and educational needs are met.  You hope that you have raised them in such a way that they are able to go out in the world and lead happy, productive lives.  <br>  <br>  I think being a parents is more work than anyone can imagine without actually doing it.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	well it depends, I have a child with autism wihch I never dreamt Id have  a child with needs, it has been harder at times with him on so many levels but compared to my daughter getting ready to turn 4 hes a breeze and she doesnt have autism,lol|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	I'd say easier, so far, but my son is only 8 1/2 months old.  Not that it doesn't have its challenges, but I knew nothing about babies when I had him and everything felt and came very naturally.|`|X0G4UMCAaa	Depends on the day...Today I'd say yes but yesterday I'd have said no... it also depends on the time of day as well...|`|hXoUFWL1aa	Easier. I thought it would be so difficult, but I love it and things seem to be going smoothly so far.|`|DNygQdmVaa	About the same.<br>  though I never thought Id be taking care of my brothers as well as my own.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Some days it's easy some days it's hard. It all depends on what day you catch me on:)|`|FsFUo4VJaa	About the same it is not hard until they start talking back.
wiAVa1H5aa	Doesn't he cheese the dare devil when he has his kids?   Most dads do.  I'd go with him, get him a satellite phone and GPS locater, and pack survival kits for each kid to carry (small, has a pocket knife, twine, high energy bar, matches, fish hook, mirror for signaling, and emergency shelter) at all times.   Also counsel the kids to stay put if they get lost or hurt.   Survival training courses are available for many kids through back country rescue or sometimes local community colleges, and I highly recommend that sort of training before wilderness camping.<br>  <br>  But in general, driving to a camp site is VERY mild and not cause for concern, hiking out many miles is something else.  As is taking a boat out, a plane to a site...   I've done all of those things, but driving means there are other folks around and you're not that far from civilization.   Calm the worries.|`|efe84b7f6da67ab7f16953aec019b750aa	You need to relax and be darn dang-doodley lucky that your children have a father that is willing to spend time with his children.  You need to also try to understand that taking children camping is not a bad endevor, at all, and that they will not only learn things from their father (such as enjoying the great outdoors and possibly learning very useful skills--organization, teamwork, camp cooking (age appropriate activities, etc) you (everyong involved & assuming that you are going, too) will fondly remember (of course, this will be a lesson about adaptability and enjoyment---if you were to go, would you make everyone misserable because you want to be? hopefully not.) this activty for always:-)  People are happier in life and get more out of it by sharing EXPERIENCES, as apposed to things.  And, who is to say that the "city" is any safer?  I understand your concerns regarding the safety of your children, especially when they have not been exposed to a different type of environment.  But, there are many online guides to camping with children that you can easily read and adapt to your own needs.  I hope you will try the experience and possibly look at it as a positive life/marriage/family experience.  You going will also help to ensure the safety of your children (you didn't say whether you were going or not).  I hope you have fun!!|`|prqrQcd1aa	Well, tell him that there will be no 4 wheeling w/ no seat belts and that there is a difference between going over a small bump and a HILL. LOL.<br>  <br>  Camping- there is nothing wrong with that at all..maybe con him into only doing the camping and not the 4 wheeling.. the kids shouldn't really be on a 4 wheeler anywase.|`|SehQJ3Kjaa	If it isn't possible for you to go with them. Would you be able to find another who you really trusted to go with them?. That way you would a at least know he would have a little help if needed! Good luck sounds like fun and the kids love camping!|`|ge3meKYEaa	Why aren't you going as a family?<br>  I would never let my husband go alone.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Go with them and supervise.  Even if you aren't a "green acres" kind of girl, if it comes down to supervising the safety of your children, I'm sure you'll be able to suck it up a little.  Not to mention you can have fun as a family!<br>  <br>  That being said, he's the father and deserves just as much respect and trust as you do in regards to the children.  He's been doing this for 10 years.  Even if he doesn't do things the same way you do them doesn't mean he's not capable of keeping their safety in mind.  Even if he's fearless, I'm sure keeping the kids safe is always his top priority.  I would be deeply offended if I wanted to take the kids out for an adventure and my husband didn't trust that I'd appropriately care for them.|`|sqaey2Siaa	Well, you could always tag along..it sounds like a good time to me!!! I'm sure he wouldnt' put the kids well being in danger, I know its VERY hard sometimes but if you plan on staying behind, just let the kids go and spend time with Daddy and try to keep your mind off it the best you can. Shop, get your nails/toes done..hang out with girlfriends things you dont get to enjoy with your kids tagging along.|`|RLoilwCNaa	He'll be ok. As long as he knows the land, he'll be fine.|`|dwt1sidtaa	Go with him and have fun!!   I know a lot of dads who would never take the time to do something nice for their kids.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Is going with him an option??  How fun that sounds!!!!!!!!!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	That's how it use to be. Go with him and have some fun.

CdJtH0xdaa	College is a time when children begin growing up. Also, a lot of parents believe that they should stop supporting their children after they turn eighteen. So, that might be a reason why she doesn't pay her son very much; she wants him to become a responsible adult and make his own money.|`|z6IekuwSaa	When I was on college I lived on about one meal a day. I think most college kids are  like that. Plus he's prolly tryin to scam beer money from you. See, if he lives in the dorms you have to have a meal card and you get 3 meals a day, all you can eat, in any chow hall around campus. That's how it was at OSU anywho. Most people got their beer money by playing the poor college role.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	she's a b**** ! poor kid i wonder how he does it 30 isnt enough. He should try finding a small part time even a job that lets him work atleast once a day I'm sure he'll make more in day than what his mom gives him. I cant find any other reason why she wont give him more he needs to eat|`|f7c5471c72f7f084411ee3f3f3e4b818aa	1) Maybe she wants him to be more independent<br>  2) She prolly had a hard timed through college and wants to teach him a lesson that she didn reach where she is easily<br>  3) or maybe whoever told u he only got $30 lied.|`|cuJXxImAaa	If you are not a kid from Somalia or some poverty stricken country, I don't think you can live with a dollar a day...

dgRTkccBaa	I took my kids to Gymboree for a while, but they got bored with it.  After 10 minutes my son would be at the gate wanting to leave, so for the money I decided it wasn't worth it because it was costing me a fortune and the kids were bored.<br>  For the same money I joined a gym with a child care center.  my kids LOVE going there to play and I get to work out at the same time.  My kids like unstructured playtime much better, so this works better for them.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	nope , to expensive, i can take them to the park and do the same thing with them =)|`|cz9dogpvaa	i have my 3 younger ones in gymboree they are 1, 1 and 4|`|SnQvsOPwaa	My daughter started dance at three.

LkgrqlKXaa	That snotty stuff would be your "plug". My first child birth I had nothing but back labor. I felt nothing in the front and even pain meds let up the pain. If this your first child? After I had wiped that snotty plug it was a full week till I gave birth and I was 50% effaced and 2 cm dilated but like you said not two pregnancies are the same. Pressure usually means that your baby is dropping. If I were you I would keep an eye on the back pain. See if the pain is regular. It could be tonight and it could be a week from now! Good luck and congrats!!!|`|xDEYAUwGaa	Ok so I was 2cm as well and 100% efaced for probably 2 weeks before having my son.  If you are having cramps in your lower back and pressure I would go get that checked out!  My labor started as a back ache, I didn't even realize I was in labor until I noticed my stomach tightening every 5 mins, so watch for that.  You can tell when it tightens because it gets really hard.  I started my labor at about 9:30pm and had him at 2:03am.  When I got to the hospital at 11, I was already 7cm dialted! He was my first child and I only had a 5 hour labor and I only pushed 3 times and he was out.  No pain meds or anything.  But yes I would defiantely watch for that pressure... good luck with everything!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i was 2cm and 50% at 33 weeks and i delivered at 36 weeks|`|1JbdCRdtaa	Honestly I would bet that you have about a week left! It's really all up to you how bad you want that baby out. You can have sex and then go on a walk... to try and get labor going.  But from my experience i would guess a week!! Good luck!!!

She does get teachers sometimes saying Carrie, but she corrects them once and then it's all fine.  She's 22 yrs old now.  She does get compliments on her name and people sometimes just call her Kai, but mostly people don't shorten it, she goes by her full name, Kairi.  So my vote is for Kairi.|`|HMPdnhApaa	Aren't you the one that always answers rudely to other women's normal names saying THEY are not any good? lol  Kairi looks like Carrie and that is how people would always pronounce it. Catalina is salad dressing... and Alyvia looks better spelled correctly.|`|bHI4NLonaa	Terrible. All of them except Catalina.

MHOxPs8Oaa	Outside during the summer. Inside during the winter.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	If it is a nice day, then take her somewhere outside|`|SnQvsOPwaa	outside|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	We live in the country.  On nice days (sunny, warm) my children spend as much time as possible outdoors.  The excercise and fresh air are good for them.  If it is cold, or hot (we live in the south, and it gets VERY hot for most of the summer and in the winter we get VERY cold, but it does not last a long time) then I make them go out for as long as they can stand it, without it being dangerous.  <br>  <br>  When we go places, it depends on what we want to do and what the weather is like.  For instance, we are more likely to go to the zoo or park on a nice day, but if it is rainy or extreme temperatures and we just feel the need to get out of the house, we would be more likely to go to Chuck E. Cheese or a movie, bowling, etc.<br>  <br>  If you are asking which I would have chosen, since you said it was nice outside we woudl have gone to the area you described rather than Chuck E. Cheese.|`|4NiGsqnCaa	Well, with my kids we are always outside getting exercise and i would much rather my children getting exercise than playing in an arcade. that is just my family, we love the outdoors and nature.|`|5d4e887ca959e59c94f23e2dba055e2faa	Why don't you rotate, that way she'll get to be outside and inside.Just ASK your daughter what she enjoys because you don't want to waste money and time on something your daughter is not gonna like.|`|FiUprYsvaa	If it is nice out take her outside.<br>  <br>  Chuck E.Cheese smells like diapers and poo. So it the weather is bad and you can stand the smell go to Chuck E.Cheese.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	it just depends on the day...how nice it is outside and what we feel like doing. but if shes never been to chuck e cheese before then why not take her?|`|LwbwMFX9aa	outside honey !|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	If it's nice outside, then be outside as much as you can.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Depends on the weather. <br>  During rainy season and summer we stay inside or when it is not too hot we go to the beach.  <br>  During fall and winter we go outside every day.
t9S0dqfLaa	You're not caging her, you're keeping her safe.<br>  If they're very close friends I wouldn't try to sell them your stuff but that's just my feeling|`|vcxdTXbraa	i used my pack and play until he realized he could climb out of it and he did not try to climb out until he was two|`|n3PE2lvDaa	nothing wrong with the playpen. You are keeping her safe. Use it as long as you can before she trys to escape. But dont leave her unattended as she may escape at that age. But it is a great way to keep her outside without having to hold her hand the whole time incase she runs for the pool.<br>   Instead of selling it why not lend it with the intention of getting it back after they have used it? that way you dont have to worry about storage as it is safe at their house until their baby is too big for it. If you dont need it when they give it back then sell it on to strangers. Just me though. I wouldt feel comfortable asking friends to pay for the stuff Im giving them|`|oDGpmkMaaa	I don't see anything wrong with asking for money for the big tickets items. But if your going to get them back for your next baby you wouldn't want to charge. I would store the clothes in a plastic tub.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I think its fine. Your problem will more likely be that she won't want to stay in it for more than a few minutes. Buy some new toys that you can rotate to help keep her entertained.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I don't think 1 is too old to use a playpen, but your daughter might not want to stay in there. My sons 13 months old, and I might as well forget about ever using the play pen again, they are handy when you go outside, but I just don't see my son ever staying in it now, he wants to be out and running... it might last for maybe 5 minutes before you daughter gets tired of it. <br>  We just gave all of our sons stuff away. I gave away his swing, his exersaucer, bassinet, all of his clothes etc... we didn't ask them to pay, because they are really lacking money right now, but I did ask that if everything was still in working condition if I could have it back when they were done with it. And they were more than fine with that. When and if I get it back I just plan on selling the stuff in yard sales. If they are willing to pay and have the money to do so then sure offer to sell them, those items weren't cheap, and people shouldn't expect you to just GIVE them to them... if they don't want to pay for them then just do like I did, let them borrow them. If they asked you for the stuff then say "okay you can have the clothes, but the other stuff was pricey so i would like to sell that" if they don't want to buy it then just let them go elsewhere and have a yard sale this summer!|`|9QVjNaIPaa	my son is 11 months old and we still put him in the playpen at times, such as you mentioned. i dont see a problem with it. <br>  <br>  i do not think it is rude to ask for money for the larger, pricier items. the little things are fine to give away but nobody should expect you to just hand over expensive items for free.|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	Since you are planning on having more babies, I would find a way to store what you have somewhere, somehow.  Why spend the money all over again?  <br>  <br>  If you absolutely can't do that then yes, I think it would be okay to ask for some sort of monies for your more expensive items.  Your friend may even do the decent thing and offer!  I would say something in passing like, "I was thinking of selling so&so's swing.  We paid $100 for it and he/she barely even used it" and see what she says.  <br>  <br>  About the playpen...hmm, that's a toughy.  My son was walking quite well at 9-1/2 months, so we really didn't have a need for it anymore.  He loves his freedom and would have flipped out being in it anyway.  I guess it's just a matter of what your baby will tolerate.  I would try going without though.  Just a thought....<br>  <br>  We stored all of my sons clothes in large 49-gallon plastic bins with snap on tight lids.  We are pregnant again, but we're having a girl this time.  I am just going to have a garage/yard sale this spring.  The bins have kept the clothes in very good condition.  <br>  <br>  Hope I've helped.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	Since you are planning on having another baby, maybe you can just loan them to your friend! I am sure you know from your daughter how expensive it is to buy everything new for a baby. I loaned a bunch of stuff to a friend of mine for her son, and she gave it all back when she was done. Now I can use it for my next son due in May. Also look into putting up a storage shed on your property if possible. <br>  Also, I don't think a year is too big to attempt the playpen. If your daughter is like either of my kids, she might not like it though! Maybe look into getting a gated play yard. They can be a bit bigger than a playpen, and she probably won't feel as "caged".<br>  Good Luck!|`|LY2LSzPJaa	Play pen - When they can climb out is when they are to old. M daughter stopped using hers at 14months , she could climb out by then but she only wanted to sleep in there for some reason. <br>  <br>  Friends/baby stuff - Thats a hard one , cause I couldnt ask for money from a friend. I always would give clothes and little things like you said but on the larger things I would post for sale , because like you said you will need to replace some things for older babies. <br>  When storing stuff you want to keep like little stuff , go get a big tubberware box from walmart $15 and there ya go! <br>  Also neat idea I did , make a quilt out of your childs receiving blankets and onesis , they can keep it for life , then when they have there child they can add on to it.|`|VCCKfT3taa	There's nothing morally wrong with using a playpen, as long as you don't just sit her in there for hours and forget about her. Of course most mothers wouldn't think of doing that, but it isn't unheard of. Make sure the pen is big enough for her crawl around and it has toys for her to play with and don't leave her in it unattended and you should be fine. It think maybe a year and a half to two years is a little old for a playpen.<br>  <br>  Secondly, how good of "friends" are these? If they are just friend that you met through other friends, or friends you don't talk to more than once every week or two then it's perfectly okay to let them know that you're giving them some things, but you plan to sell the items that cost you more than 100 or 150. But if you consider them GOOD friends then it would probably be bad form to ask them for money. That doesn't mean you're obligated to give your friends your stuff that you can't store. Maybe a relative can store things like the swing for you? <br>  <br>  Also, you might be able to work out a deal with your friends that the big ticket items will be kept within your circle; they can use them for their baby and then keep the items for your (hopefully) next baby?<br>  <br>  Lastly, I heard that a cedar chest helps keep out dust and moths well. <br>  Wash them one last time with dreft and fold them neatly.|`|oiJITSNZaa	I put my 1 year old daughter in the play pen if I am outside and doing something dangerous for her to be around. She can have toys in there and easily see me and yet not be endangered.<br>  As for baby things, it would depend on the situation. If you want the items back and are just loaning them then definitely no. If you are getting rid of them for good, you can mention that you have them and are planning to sell them but they have first chance at them.<br>  Plastic totes are great for storing clothes. Store by size like newborn in one, then 0-3months and so on. Good Luck!|`|vjK8ZT20aa	I think as long as you aren't using a playpen as a fulltime babysitter I think you are A OK and very responsible to put your baby in a playpen poolside.  It will be good for her to be outdoors and this keeps her in a safe enviroment, just make sure, as I am sure you will, that she also gets to enjoy her feet in the grass too.  Secondly I don't think its rude to ask for money for the big items.  Your friends she understand this, and know that they are getting great gently used items at a great price, and also be appreciative of any stuff that you just give them, unless you know that they are going to take great care of things such as the swing you could tell them that they could use it but you would like to get it back, that way after your next baby is born you won't have to buy new stuff all over again.  Your MIL should understand, but it is probably best just to run it by her as you said.  As far as storing clothes, I like plastic totes! They keep things dry and bugs out.  LOVE THEM!!  Good luck to you!
VKQzj4Pmaa	I will give my son a cell phone whenever he obtains his driver's license. I feel that cell phones are good for emergencies (getting lost, flat tire, car troubles, needing to call for help, etc.). <br>  <br>  I would give him a phone with limited minutes, no texting, no web access, and no camera phone is needed. Once turning 16, he will need a job, and so if he wants to buy his own phone and pay for a plan with more minutes, then that is fine. <br>  <br>  However, he would not be allowed to have a phone with internet access while living in my house.

VS8mactUaa	Baking Powder is not the same. But Even still a luke warm bath, folloed by some calamine lotion should help wonders when it starts to itch, as well for the soreness a childrens tylenol should help wonders for the sore ness. Have her wear light clothes like silk, that would irritate them the least, as well the tylenol should help ith the fever as well with the bath. And take notice, check the inside of her mouth frequently more so on the back of her throat, I had them down my throat, o kep an eye on it and if you see it consult a doctor right away.|`|rYNM67oyaa	No. Baking powder and soda aren't the same.

The latter is probably healthier and more 'normal' because that's how breastfed babies typically eat.<br>  <br>  Listen to your baby. If he wants 2-3 ounces at a time, make up a 3 ounce bottle.  If he's hungry again an hour later, make anoher bottle. (Don't refeed a bottle that's been sitting out for more than an hour! That can make him very sick.) <br>  <br>  As for his sleeping, again, all babies are different. He sounds like a cat-napper.  If he's awake and happy, don't feel you need to feed him so he'll go back to sleep. (He's probably NOT hungry 15 minutes after eating.)|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	what he eats is what he will eat. You are doing fine. When he is not hungary he will not eat any more. Trust me babies and toddlers will not starve themselves if you make sure that the food/milk is there for them they will take it when they want it. Now that he is ten months old he should be with food and not just formula. If you have not started him on food that is why he wakes up so much. If you feed him food about an hour before bed time and then feed him milk right before bed time then he should be sleeping better.<br>  Tyffannie|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	You should be feeding him as much as he'll eat.  If he can't finish 4oz, then don't make any more then that.|`|aGxbD6snaa	what formula milk are you using? it sounds like hes hungry. i am using sma for my daughter, she started doing the same on the gold milk so i put her on the white and she is much happier and sleeps from around 10pm until 5/6am. maybe that is the right amount for him but just not filling enough, or maybe he needs a bit of baby rice. trust your instinct. my daughter is 7 weeks old and im planning on keeping her on formula for as long as i can get away with. good luck.
IGwX328eaa	I say give him cereal for breakfast then the vegetable for lunch and dinner. But you have to wait 3 days before introducing anything new so if you introduce carrots wait three days to give him peas this is to make sure he doesn't have an allergy to a certain food. But i would do vegetables starting at 4 months fruits at 5 months then meat at 6 months (this is how i did it) you can introduce however you want to. some people say if you introduce fruits first then your baby wont want vegetables.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If you trust your doctor so much shouldn't she have told you how long to go in between each new food, and how much.<br>  <br>  ============<br>  The point is you say you want advice but that you insist your doctor knows best.  If your doctor knows best then why ask us?<br>  <br>  How am I supposed to know what she meant by cereal, then vegetables, then fruit, then meat.<br>  <br>  I have never seen a feeding guide that recommends that at all.  Of course I avoid the sites sponsored by baby food companies.<br>  <br>  Every single reputable source says nothing until 6 months.  Then either low iron foods until solids are a regular part of the diet then start high iron foods like meat, or start high iron, high protein, high fat foods right away.<br>  <br>  No reputable source says to force three meals a day on a baby, most say not to even offer a second meal per day until 7-8 months and not a third one until 12 months.<br>  <br>  If your doctor is right that you have to stick to one new food for several days (which has very much been disproven, but your doctor is always right obviously) and you have to give 3 meals a day then yes that would mean carrots for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.<br>  <br>  It drives me bonkers when people want "advice" but only want advice that doesn't go against what their doctor would say.  If only what your doctor says is trustworthy go ask your doctor what she meant -none of us are mindreaders and even if we were we'd have to know which doctor!|`|OPloDbxvaa	the cereal you start only the mornings for acouple days to see if he's good on it , then morning and before bed for a couple dasy then you start vegetables for lunch and cereal morning and night, for a couple days and change your vegetables keep it like this for aweek then add it for dinner also so cereal breakfast ,vegetables, lunch and dinner , and cereal a night,  then every now and then you change the veggies, then after aweek you try fruits at the same time as the veggies , <br>  <br>  rice cereal is hard to digest i had to put mine on barley or he would cry bloody murder... <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|vvB0Etysaa	Breakfast is rice cereal... Try 3-6 tablespoon with water.<br>  <br>  Lunch is rice cereal with pears or banana fruit ( 2-3 tablespoon)<br>  <br>  Supper is rice cereal with a vegetable.  I believe less than l/2 jar of each as he is still small.  You will know if he is still hungry.<br>  After Lunch & Supper wait about one hour than give him the bottle.<br>  I would check on the vegetables first because I think 4 months might be to early.  Check with the doctor which kinds of vegetables.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	LOL carrots for breakfast does sound funny.<br>   Once they are eating fruits, just mix some in with the cereal and they will love it !<br>  after you have tried a few fruits I 'd go to fruit.  so maybe a month later|`|B5MDTdtPaa	you start off once a day fo them to get used to it and thne you build it up ot 3 times a day - he might not even take it yet he might refuse to open his mouth or take it and dribble it all out seeing as hes so young - you can try though but most babies dont do it that early-mine strarted at 5 months 1 weeks (tried once a week since 4 months old but she completely rejected it until that time even tohugh my doc said she could start at 4 months)...<br>  <br>  when he is ready start off once a day with cereal if you want...and then introduce veggies one at a time to check for allergies...once youve done veggies move onto fruit etc<br>  <br>  well not all babies like cereal - mine doesnt she went strasight onto sweet potato so has things like that for breakfast and tea at the moment...havnt introduce lunch yet as shes still getting used to it all|`|b99kfMPcaa	Wait at least two days before starting a new food.  Like, give him peas one day and the next day, and then if he shows no sign of a reaction (which is not likely) then move onto another veggie.  After a majority of the veggies are tested, then move onto fruit.  Start off with bananas first, and save the berries (strawberries, blueberries, etc.) for last because they are most likely to cause an allergic reaction.  Baby food doesn't have much nutritional value at this age, so as long as your baby is still breastfed or bottle fed, it doesn't matter how much or what baby food he eats.  Also, they don't really understand the concept of "breakfast", "lunch", and "dinner", so to them they can eat carrots in the morning and it won't matter to them.  However, for my own enticement, I gave my son oatmeal (he hated rice cereal) for breakfast and then the veggies and fruit for lunch and dinner.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	You don't have to start solids just because your doctor says to.  This is "old school" advice and your doctor may not be up to date.  It is the safest to wait until 6 months.  If you feel your baby is ready before this, then by all means, start.<br>  <br>  Try this link.  It will give you tons of info on starting solids:  when, what, how...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wholesomebabyfood.com/readyforsolids.htm" rel="nofollow">http://wholesomebabyfood.com/readyforsol...</a>|`|yF9Z06ruaa	Some doctors say to start veggies first, however my sons' doctor always had my boys start with fruits. The feeding schedule that I have used for all 3 of my boys goes like this:<br>  <br>  4 months~<br>  Lunch only (formula or breast-milk for other meals like usual)~ maybe 1 or 2 tablespoons~rice cereal WITH applesauce mixed in it (who likes plain rice cereal? blah!) make it a thin consistency at first, then make it thicker as your son can tolerate it and make larger amounts if he seems to want more.<br>  After 3 days (remember to watch for reactions!) try bananas, pears, or peaches. Add the next fruit in 3 days later, and then 3 more days for the next.  Any of these fruits can be mixed with the cereal or fed alone (serve about 2-3oz at a meal, think smallest baby food jars, and work your way up to what ever your son is comfortable eating). Once he has eaten all of the single fruits, you can start giving him mixed fruits ~ bananas&apples, pears&prunes, and so on...You can also switch up the cereal that he eats, ie. oatmeal or mixed instead of rice. Just stick to the 3 day rule with these too.<br>  <br>  5 months~<br>  Breakfast ~ move the rice cereal w/ fruit to the morning.<br>  Lunch ~ yellow/orange veggies first ~ squash, carrots, sweet potatoes, etc ~ then green veggies ~ green beans, peas. Again remember to wait 3 days before introducing the next one. Your son can also have fruit after his veggies as 'dessert'.<br>  <br>  6 months~<br>  Breakfast ~ same as above<br>  Lunch ~ same as above<br>  Dinner ~ give whatever veggie and fruit combo you desire<br>  <br>  7 months ~<br>  no changes except to increase amounts that you are feeding him if need be.<br>  <br>  8 months ~<br>  add white meats to lunch and/or dinner. Chicken, turkey, pork.  I always mixed the baby food meats with fruits or veggies because they are kind of yucky when eaten alone (chicken & apples, turkey & sweet potatoes) Remember to wait 3 days between new foods.<br>  <br>  9 months ~ <br>  Same as 8 months, and adding pink/red meats. veal, beef, etc.  I also started table foods at 9 months. Noodles, breads, crackers, etc.
BZjkpBB8aa	As much of a pain as it is, I premake all my daughters snacks for her and daddy time :)  Shred the cheese into a container, cut up the fruit etc...Set it in a special spot in the fridge/counter and tell him where it is.  If it's easy for him to grab for her, it may be easier for you to stop the cycle of junk food!  <br>  My husband has now begun eating 'junk' when our daughter isn't in the room or she's in bed.  It helps with the 'why can't I if daddy does' scenario.  GOOD LUCK!!<br>  (If you really want to get him, find articles that state the effects of junk food in young children in the future!  Does he want an unhealthy, overweight little one??)|`|6UNoyA6Iaa	My husband does the same thing it drives me crazy cause my kids think I am the mean mommy who won't let them have the good stuff. I finally had to yell at my husband and tell him that it was not ok. it worked|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	Could you make a few snack trays that your husband could grab out of the fridge when he doesn't want to take the time to prepare something.  That way you control the snacks; would also help your son to see daddy eating (or pretending to eat) these too.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	To prevent that I sorta make snacks and meal and put them in the fridge.  I tell him hey theres so and so for whatever meal or snack and he is so thankful so he doesnt have to worry about it.  He still gives her junk but I dont mind, its after she's had a meal and its very rare that its just those 2 so its special.  But try to have things prepared so he has no excuses and you arent worrying that Gracee is eating too much junk.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Hmmmm....my hubby throws a FIT if I or anyone else give Emma an occassional cookie, LOL.  He wants to eat junk in front of her and tell her she can't have it.  I don't know what to tell you to do except to just come right out and say he is giving her to much junk....ask him to please give her healthier things (maybe you should have them handy in the fridge premade) and save the junky snacks for when she is sleeping....|`|x3fQP9viaa	Stop buying it, get fruits instead.

I do know people who have waited longer than that but I feel like the longer you wait the more attached they get.|`|KNX2sKr7aa	My son is 21 months and our goal was to get rid of the pacifier before he turned 2. We've been only giving it to him for naps and bedtime, and it's going okay.  However, my son will be 2 in June, which is also when we're expecting our 2nd baby.  So, he might be keeping it until he's 2 1/2.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Welll.....before Emma I would have said 12 - 24 months they get to old for the paci.  But that said, am I taking away Emma's?  No....I'll probably see if she'll give it up on her own before she is 3.  She does have limits though....she only gets it in bed and in the car....we need to start not allowing her to have it in the car.|`|PjlAty2Paa	i took my sons away at 20/21 because he could understand he didnt need it anymore.  started by doing it slowly away from  day nap. gave it bedtime nap etc.  slowly each day then he understood, lost interest forgot all about it.<br>  <br>  taking it away cold turket i think is a bit cruel its there little comfort measure im sure i would be upset .|`|wxEqpMrEaa	Never. I never had one, because lets face it, it is just one more thing to break them from. Get rid of it now before it is too late and she gets bad teeth.|`|oiJITSNZaa	We took our daughters away at 13 months. Once they start teething a pacifier is hard on the teeth forming. Also the sooner the easier!|`|WOHc22Xiaa	My son stop wanting the binky and bottle at 10 months but all babies are different. I think 2 years old should be the cut off point.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	I agree.  I would of started around 12 months but then again, my daughter never had a pacifier.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Definitely get rid of it.<br>  My son's pediatrician goes by the 1 year old and they should be off the bottle and on a sippy cup and if they use a pacifier they should be off it at 1 year old. <br>  <br>  Your daughter may fuss for a day or two, but gather them up and toss them out. Better yet, have HER help you put them in a zip bag and put them out in the trash can. Then the next morning have a little gift bag with a big kid toy in it for her. It could be something simple like a sippy cup and a coloring book with crayons or a new lovey she can carry (a blanket or stuffed animal)  but make a big deal out of it into becoming a big kid for giving up the pacifiers.  Whatever you do resist the urge to cave in when the whining for it starts the first couple days without it.  If you cave in you'll have a bigger battle to rid them out later.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	3 IMO  my son enver took one though. i bugs me when little kids are trying to talk to me and they haeva  pacifier in their mouths|`|ENANtueuaa	It depends...if they only use it for bedtime and naps, then it's not really a big deal, unless you don't want it to mess up their teeth. I think if they older than 2, it shouldn't be used during the day anymore, because it delays their speech. I took my daughter's pacifier away at about 13-14 months.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	After their teeth come in, if they have a pacifier, it can begin to push their teeth forward or leave gaps. So I think around then is the best time. I threw mine away on my 2nd birthday on my own, but I'd say age wise that's a good time.|`|AA11109728	I think it should be gone by age 2.  My daughter showed signs on her own of not needing it anymore by then, so it went fairly easily.|`|KmC0K59taa	Mine just gave it up at 21 months.  It was MUCH easier than I thought it would be.  She cried the first night for 30 mins then that was it.
rDPADat1aa	My husband helps with our children all the time and will definitely take the initiative on it.  We have three kids ages 9, 6, and 3 and are expecting our fourth in May.  <br>  <br>  As an example, my husband stays home with our kids in the evenings while I go to the gym.  When I get home, they are bathed (and yes, they smell clean too!) and in their pj's all ready for bed.  No one is crying.  I don't have to worry about him taking care of our kids.  They are OUR children, not just mine.  If someone asks him if he's "babysitting" while out, he gets upset.  He's not babysitting when they're his kids.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.  Tell your hubby that if he isn't hands-on now, he better get that way.  Your kids will remember how involved he was as adults and their relationship then will reflect the relationship he has now.  Plus, they'll learn to parent like him.  Does he want his grandkids begging for attention from their parents?<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11210211	My hubby does help,I usually have to ask him to help though except on the weekends when he is off,then he gets up with the kids and lets me sleep in.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Yes, my husband does help out.

I'm was a stay at home mommy and anytime I needed help my hubby would do so. Whenever he came home he wanted to spend time with our son.

From the time my children came home from the hospital until today (they are 3 & 18 months) he's been a great help! He just knows what they need and does it, I do not have to say "Dear, I think she needs to be feed" or "It's bath time" just knows and does it! He even takes the girls to their well-child checks and enjoys it! The only thing he doesn't do is pick out their clothes, PJs fine buts not outfits. He always leaves that to me. I always lay out their clothes the night before and if he gets them dressed the clothes are already out and he doesn't have to ask me to pick them out. This may be different as the child I am currently pregnant with is a boy and their clothes are much easier!|`|1dueLOdvaa	My boyfriend is very hands on.<br>  <br>  He kind of takes over after work (as far as the kids go.)

He changes diapers, makes bottles, and gets down and dirty with our 4 year old.<br>  <br>  He is very helpful on the weekends too.<br>  <br>  ETA: And yes I do have to ask sometimes.|`|n3PE2lvDaa	my parnter is very hands on with the baby. from day 1 he has been changing nappies, playing with her, getting up in the night to comfort her, helping with baths, pushing her in the pram when I need a break, reading her bedtime stories etc. I never have had to ask him. He just does it because he loves his daughter and wants to be as involved as he can be. He works during the week so I get up in the night from monday to friday but if our daughter is having a bad night in the weekend he gets up and goes to her half of the time- we take turns in the weekend. He also gets up with her every saturday morning and lets me have a sleep in. his sleep in day is sunday. <br>  He also feeds her her solids when he gets home from work and from 5-6 is daddy daughter time where they chase each other around the living room and play silly games. This gives me a chance to cook tea uninterrupted.<br>  <br>  Wow, I am going on! but I am seriously so impressed with his skills as a daddy. My daughter is so lucky to have such a wonderful father and she knows it- she is 9 months old now and such a daddies girl!|`|mAJZFmIEaa	Yes he does, he gets home from work and takes over with her while i boil her water and do her bottles.

I don't think there are a lot who do it instictevely, but that doesn't mean they can't be taught.|`|MCiSrm2Vaa	yes!! my husband does help with my baby girl.  he holds her for the time i do cooking etc.  he feeds her, plays with her.  and sometimes when my daughter does sleep until late at night, he stays up with her and plays with her, try to put her to sleep.  helps me bathe her.  stays home with her when i go shopping etc. actually he is better at kids than i am, really...he has lots of patience.  only thing that he never done is change the diaper, thats okay with me, as far as he helps me in other things.  but honestly, u kind of push them to help u with the kids in the begining, u have to keep asking for help until they start doing it themselves.  luckily mine started helping me very early, did not have to work very hard.  tell ur husband its his child as well, u did not buy is from somewhere.|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	My hubby is very hands on when he's not working that is.

Being a SAHM, it's difficult for her to play with someone other than Mommy :S
0viZhxi6aa	My son was taken by c-section at 33 weeks which is 7 weeks early. He cried at birth and got a hole in his lung (pneumothorax) and was on the ventilator and had a chest tube for three days. They also had to run a PICC line which is a better kind of IV to get him his medication. He was on a fentalin drip, which kept him pretty much comatose, but they had to because he kept extabating himself (pulling his breathing tube) After the hole in his lung healed (at 3 days old) they were able to let him "wake up" and they took him off everything but his feeding tube. He spent 5 weeks in the NICU and was able to come home 2 weeks before his due date. All in all, he did ok. Other babies have more problems, others have less. If you want to do something nice for your friend, be there for her. Being a NICU mom is very stressful, and having someone to talk to helps. She will be sore after her c-section, and if they send her home before her baby (and they probably will) she will not only be a mess physically, but emotionally as well. Ask her if she needs help, and keep offering even if she says she has it covered. I wish them the best of luck...........|`|pDGVTLoFaa	It not only depends on how early but also how the baby reacts,all premature babies have some problems but with the advancement in this field things are so much better. My Son was born nine weeks early and had breathing difficulties in fact I was told that he may well not pull through and they advised me to call in the priest to read him his last rights. The wonderful news is that he pulled through and I am very proud of my son who is 27. It seems your friend will be in very capable hands and will have many experienced doctors around her and I wish her all the best. x|`|3URupc7caa	Hi..there is a very good chance of survival for the baby because the medical equipment and stuff is alot better these days..My cousin was born really early at about 23 weeks and my aunty was told there wasnt much chance of her surviving she had complications but she is now a 16 years old healthy girl :D<br>  Never give up hope :)|`|kJ4g1vujaa	That should be ok.<br>  Best of luck.<br>  <br>  My work colleague had a baby at 24 weeks and she survived.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	You really can't tell anything for sure until the baby is born. The baby is viable outside the womb starting at 23 weeks, and their chances of survival go up 3% each day after that. At 27 weeks a baby has a 85% chance of survival. 7 weeks is pretty early, and most likely the baby will be in NICU until her actual due date 7 weeks from now, but he/she will most likely make it out okay, without any really serious, lasting problems. My sister and I were both 6 weeks early and born to a drug addicted mother, each weighing 3lbs and some odd ounces at birth. And this was in the 1980's (83 for her, 87 for me) and we were each kept in NICU for a while, but are both completely healthy now, and neither of us suffered any health problems as children, with the exception of my heart murmer which healed on it's own with time (as they usually do).<br>  <br>  Good luck to your friend, I'm sure with treatment her baby will be fine.|`|a5FjIQFzaa	There's no way of knowing if the baby will be 100%, only time will tell,<br>  <br>  On the plus side, my friend's sister had a baby boy on Tuesday who was 10 weeks early and only 2lb 2oz, but he seems to be doing well and was breathing on his own from the start.  I don't think the docs had a chance to inject any steriods into him to build up his lungs, but i don't know.<br>  <br>  The really weird thing is that I'm currently a week overdue with my first - there's no way my friend expected her sister to give birth before me.|`|qisy7yuSaa	my midwife told me today that after 24 weeks, the baby has a high chance of survival, if your friend is 7 weeks early her baby will be about 33 weeks? if so her baby will be fine, just a little smaller than usual, the last 8 weeks are mainly to fatten the baby up, and time for baby to grow, i really wouldnt worry about your friend, her baby will probably spend a few nights in an incubator or special care but i would think mummy and baby will be fine! xxxx|`|f1608bdb212d4515049acab36a99ef38aa	my baby girl was born at 11 weeks early i manged to get an injection in my leg for the baby's lungs (steroid) she was born fine she could breath on her own but couldn't maintain her heat this is why in incubator and couldn't feed she had a feeding tube going down from her nose to her tummy she was in special care for about 1 month but she is now 11 years old no problems with her at all only shes smaller in size and build than her friends shes very bright and loves school she was born 3lbs 14oz hope this helps you|`|c9NuCZnaaa	the baby will most likely be fine but of course there may be some complications and will definately have to stay in hospital until they are sure baby is fine. they say that a baby can be born after 25 weeks of pregnancy and have a chance of survival though it is slim.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Babies have been born at 21 weeks and survived (earliest recorded case I think).

iAQKD2YBaa	It may just fix itself on its own but it also may not, my nephew had the same problem and he was very close to having to have an operation on his head to fix the flat spot his skull was not forming properly.<br>  <br>  My suggestion to you is to try and put her on her side while you are watching her (during the day), hopefully she will stay this way.<br>  <br>  My son also favored one side of his head and my health nurse advised me to lay him on the other side for just one week, I did this and it evened out with no problems.  She suggested turning him around the other way in bed and for some reason this worked. <br>  <br>  Good luck, just get the heath nurse to check it at your appointments, I am sure she will be fine though.|`|c9NuCZnaaa	It's extemely common to get a bit of flatness on your head. i'm sure if you felt your head you'd notice it wasn't perfectly round. most peoples heads do have flat spots so i wouldn't worry about it.<br>  the flatness shouls begin to fade once she starts being able to sit up and crawl about. it probably wont go completly though. and if it gets too bad then you should contact your doctor as she might need to wear a cap for a while.|`|aYCjy8Neaa	Most likely it will return to normal over time. But you really don't want to keep letting it get worse. They sell these positioners that have memory foam pads for under the babies head. They are made specifically to prevent flat head. We used ours without the wedges, we only wanted it for the little pillow. We never had a problem with his head, so aparently is did it's job. I would look it up and see if you can find something similar.|`|5DSl9B1oaa	Yes the flat spot will go away. it may take a little time but their will probably be more bald spots only until the bay starts holding her head up and laying on her belly. I have four boys and they all had a flat spot or some bald spots until they were about 2 or 3 months old.

It might be Torticolitis.  It's were the muscle in the baby's neck are too tight on one side.  Your doctor may instruct you to do some PT at home.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	my son was teh same way.. as he started crawli9ng and sitting and wasnt on his back much it corrected itself.|`|OXSOch9Oaa	Yes it will.  It's very common on infants and is nothing to worry about.  You can always ask your doctor about it when she sees him next, but it's really not that big of a deal at all.  That happened with both of my boys and they are just fine.|`|giCUEYsJaa	Flat spots are quite common in infants.  <br>  <br>  You are doing all the right things.<br>  <br>  Keep her off of the side she favors at night during the day and she will be fine.<br>  <br>  If you are truly that concerned, take it up with her pediatrician next visit.|`|AwrtwIpIaa	It should go away as she gets older and moves around more.

d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I have 3 boys. It was right with one and wrong with the other two. It is just a myth. How can a chinese calendar predict the sex of your baby? Gender of the baby has nothing to do with the mother or when she conceived.. It is determined solely by the sperm the instant conception takes place. There are "female" sperm and "male" sperm. Whichever one fertilizes the egg, that is the sex of the baby. The calendar and all the other myths are just a fun way of guessing :) It does have a 50/50 chance of being right.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Jadea has no idea what she is talking about. The gender of a baby and the sex of a baby both mean the same thing. If you are going to be rude and say hateful things to someone, you should make sure you are right at least..lol<br>  <br>  gen·der [jénd?r]<br>  <br>  1. somebody's sex: the sex of a person or organism, or of a whole category of people or organisms (often used to avoid using the word "sex")|`|fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Of course it’s not accurate; it’s up there with asking how accurate horoscopes are. Unless you have planned to have a particular sex using something like Shettles Method so know what your babies sex will be before even conceiving, or your doctors tell you the sex of your baby there is no way to accurately predict, the most you can say is that it’s 50:50 as to whether you will have a boy or a girl. <br>  <br>  FYI gender and sex are two VERY different things, if you’re having a kid you really need to make sure you understand that difference!|`|aGxbD6snaa	it was right for me i had a girl 7 weeks ago, but i wouldnt rely on it because its not going to be 100% accurate lots of people get told the opposite sex. the sex is decided on your genes not month of conception but it is good to guess and wonder if its true. good luck.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	mine worked for me all 3 times,maybe luck?......it also happened to be accurate for both sisternlaws,and friend.....i wouldnt rely on it thought...just for fun...(but i have to admit after 2 boys,when i got pregnant this time,i looked it up right away,it said girl...at 22 weeks they said girl ..yeah!!!!)|`|HGqmsaM5aa	Nope mine stated I was having a boy and I had a girl!!! Sorry. I also found out through 3D ultra sound at 16weeks that I was having a girl!|`|pV6K2mm5aa	It was accurate for the 10 people I looked up including myself..|`|otFCWMuUaa	nope i was supposed to be having a boy n im pregnant with a  little girl =]|`|TIbmRFLQaa	No ma'am i'm supposed to have a boy and girl... i have 2 girls... thats trash|`|LUbW8kTBaa	If you go to different websites that have a chinese gender predictors on them, you'll notice that the gender charts are different.  I checked out a couple different sites...half telling me I was having a boy and the other half telling me I was having a girl.  I definitely wouldn't trust it, but it's fun to check out for entertainment purposes only before you actually do go find out the gender.|`|0YdWJVyAaa	it actually did work for me ! the predictor for all the three pregnancies was correct (2 boys and a  girl).. however... it wasnot right with my sister .. and my friend .. and my sister in law ,so it might have just been co-incidental in my case ,, goodluck anyway|`|F53OI3rkaa	Most docs agree there is no way of telling. People seem to think they way you show, what you crave and experience can be an indicator, but in reality nothing has been proven, an all pregnancies are different. The only way to tell is a scan - but you don't have to wait long anyway!! Good luck!|`|4GwTDea1aa	So nnoottt true.. it said i was supposed to be having a girl on every single test i did.. worried me so much i had to get another ultrasound just to make sure lol there is a 50/50 chance it will be right but wouldnt rely on it!|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	50% of the time like everything else :) I was supposed to have a girl both times and I have a girl and a boy. You'll fing out soon enough I know it's just about impossible to wait!!|`|mtMmhIDcaa	I'm not a mommy but I'm Chinese. I can tell you these online predictors are just for fun.

I was predicted a boy but my gorgeous baby girl is asleep in her pram :)|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	The doctor wont tell you because they CANT tell you. and sometimes you have to wait until 22-25 weeks. The predictor can be right I mean it is just a 50 50 % chance to get it right or wrong but there is really no way to know but to guess. I learned over the years with my own and my friends pregnancies that when talking about your baby do you say he or she. Although if you just say really really want a girl you try to say she. But if you are just talking and with out thinking about it say he/she. Your brain usually has the right gender.<br>  Tyffannie mother of 2 boys|`|eu6UQElYaa	Nope I used it for my first, said it would be a boy.  It was a girl.  I used it for my second, said it would be a girl and it was a boy.  Used it for this one, said it would be a girl and it's a boy.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	If you dont mind paying for the ultrasound out of pocket you can find out the sex at 16 weeks.  I did and we are having a girl.  As for the chinese generder predictor...Ya waste of time.|`|dsf5hGGnaa	I used it too, I hope it's right but I don't really believe anything. Everything has a 50/50 chance that's why so many people think they work.|`|an1b4pXxaa	They are very accurate 50% of the time.

Every day counts. We had 5 preemies (triplets, then twins, both conceived naturally). Every extra day they're in the womb is about 4 days they don't have to be in the NICU, which is very stressful. However NICU nurses were wonderful to us, and our son's "neighbour" the boy and girl next to them were born at 25 weeks, and they are both happy 3 year olds today. God bless, you're in my thoughts !|`|52U22fiAaa	My friend delivered her child at 23 weeks.  The baby was in the NICU for almost 5 months and had to be monitored very very closely.  She was at risk for many infections and her lungs were weak, but she made it!  She's now a healthy baby girl and you would never know she was preemie.  They have good chances, especially at a good hospital with an excellent NICU, but it will be scary and stressful to see your baby go thorugh this.  I hope everything works out!|`|bIvsLrCUaa	I understand you are scared but i'm sure they will be able to save your baby.

That said, the son of college friends of mine was born at about 24 weeks. He was tiny and was in the hospital for a decent bit of time.

They diagnosed him with Cerebal Palsy, but it is very mild - to the point of being non-existent.

I can't always go, so my boyfriend takes them - so it's not like we can't do things because we have a baby.|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	Hopefully you have been talking about the new baby to them your entire pregnancy.  They may not really "get it" but at least it won't be a complete surprise.  Try pointing out babies in magazines, books, on TV.  I would also suggest taking them to the toy store and letting them pick out a special gift for their soon-to-be sibling.  Let them take part in whatever way possible.  I'm expecting #2 myself, and that is what I have read.  Good luck!|`|WNnTlodGaa	try get them involved with the baby like tell them to do stuff for the baby and reward them when they do..|`|D5fdsOXuaa	Check your hospital that you will be giving birth at.  They may have classes about Siblings.  My son attended a class like this before his sister was born.  We watched a video on babies, they learned how to diaper a baby using a life-size baby doll.  He learned about small toys potential for choking and how to properly hold a baby.  There are also tons of books and DVD's that you can probably rent at a local library.

aQ8o4w3Xaa	Condoms can split, although this doesn't happen very often and is usually the result of not putting them on correctly. You have to hold the top bit when you put it on so that there is a visible tip. Condoms are pretty strong things and they can take most 'wear and tear', but occasionally they can break. He would normally be able to feel it, so if it does happen, just change it to a fresh one. Also, never *ever* use more than one at once. There's some stuuuuuupid idea that using more than one will protect you if one of them breaks. No! The two condoms will rub together and be more likely to break...both of them. Only ever use one at once.<br>  <br>  HIV can be caught by sharing any type of bodily fluids, including blood. That's why you should never share needles, because you could catch HIV. You could also get genital warts via kissing. If the other person had them in the mouth, you kissed them and you had an cuts or sores then you could catch them. Other than that, I don't think there's anything else you can get. <br>  <br>  No, you won't get covered in poop. You should never go from anal to vaginal sex without cleaning him, just in case. You could get some nasty infections from that. Always clean him...don't go straight from one to the other!<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  :)|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Condoms don't work sometimes because it's either the wrong size, not lubricated enough, and most of all, if it's not put on properly!<br>  <br>  It's very easy to break if you put it on incorrectly, and if you use oil based lubricant!<br>  <br>  Make sure you use correct size and water-based lube.<br>  <br>  Nom STD's are sexually transmitted through oral and intercourse sex.<br>  <br>  And if you have a clean anus - Why would it get covered in poop?<br>  <br>  No problem. x|`|Jn4Fpm1Laa	The Condom<br>  <br>  If you choose the condom, you will cover the penis before intercourse with a sheath made of thin latex or plastic to keep sperm from joining egg.<br>  <br>  Lubricate condoms with spermicide to immobilize sperm for increased protection against pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Effectiveness<br>  <br>  85-98 percent<br>  <br>  Latex condoms offer very good protection against HIV — the virus that can cause AIDS. They also reduce the risk of other sexually transmitted infections, including gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, HPV, and herpes.<br>  <br>  Increase your protection:<br>  <br>  Do not use oil-based lubricants, like Vaseline on latex condoms.<br>  Use correctly: Place rolled condom on tip of hard penis. Squeeze air out of half-inch space at tip. Pull back foreskin and roll condom down over penis. Smooth out any air bubbles. Lubricate with water-based lubricant, like K-Y jelly.

Teens are also likely to have more than one partner during their adolescence, which increases the likelihood of getting an infection. Using latex condoms is the best way to protect against infection for women and men of all ages who have sexual intercourse. They are also inexpensive and widely available.<br>  <br>  Caution —<br>  <br>  The cervix in pregnant women, young girls, and teen women is especially vulnerable to infection. Even as mature adults, women's sexual anatomy makes them 10 to 20 times more likely than men to become infected with sexually transmitted infections.<br>  <br>  No matter how old you are, it is very important to use condoms with your other method of birth control — whenever you are at risk for getting a sexually transmitted infection.<br>  <br>  Using the spermicide nonoxynol-9 many times a day, by people at risk for HIV, or for anal sex, may irritate tissues and increase the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.<br>  <br>  The only way to already have an STD is through unprotected 'outercourse,' sharing needles, or if you were born with one.

Women have been known to have fallen pregnant after having unprotected sex just once. Then there are those women who have been trying diligently for years to have a baby and have had no success. Mother Nature is the only one who knows what's going on iside your body right now. If you are looking to get pregnant, good luck. If you are not looking to get pregnant, then use a condom ... pregnancy should NOT be your biggest concern!|`|F53OI3rkaa	Sorry, it is a bit of a stupid question TBH, because it all depends on factors such as both your fertility (which is a little hard to tell over the internet!) its also a bit too soon to be taking a test.

The test works by detecting hormones, so if you have only just concieved, then it won't pick up on it this soon.|`|DwTTt628aa	it depends if you had sex when you were ovulating (two weeks after your last period) its best to wait till 5 weeks after the 1st day of your last period to do a test good luck!!|`|ASaTHvaBaa	All test don't show sometimes you don't find out if you are until you have had blood work done by your dr.|`|nmCwpD55aa	no matter how many times it comes you gotto to be ovulating to become pregnant.|`|ZXeUJ4RRaa	it depends if your ovulating r not|`|ukjxFnqDaa	ejaculate|`|2dzY4PtYaa	I wouldn't wait...get the lighter and coat hanger ready NOW!|`|GxlkhRfoaa	It depends on when the intercourse occurred...When your period was...When you ovulated etc...|`|JK2RvliYaa	The chances are higher for the human race if you swallow.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Anytime you have unprotected sex you put yourself at risk to get pregnant. I think you should wait to see if your period starts, if not then take a hpt.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	March 6th is very far away.  It's way too soon for a hpt. Wait AT LEAST another 4 or 5 day. But really you should wait until you're period is due.|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	It depends if you are ovulating or not. Wait a few more days to take another test.|`|otFCWMuUaa	theres really no statistic it just really has to do with the ONE sperm making it thru at the right time.
16f786290d793ae0cfafb186615cca8daa	I had tons. Especially what looked like red little veins that popped up just under the skin, all over my face and chest! Pimples, more freckles, those red things. It seemed like sun exposure made them worse, but they did fade after having my baby. Congrats on the pregnancy, by the way!|`|ueWVf6Y1aa	When pregnant, some people get beautifully soft skin while others get spotty skin. Either one of them happens to everyone, you just happen to be an unlucky one that gets spots. Just cleanse your face daily and moisturise. <br>  <br>  Congratulations on the baby!|`|4d8QwNQGaa	Don't worry, they will go away.|`|n86nMfbtaa	it's common. i have loads of them on my face :(<br>  <br>  but it comes with bearing a cute little baby (:|`|vjn03B5haa	hi there, yes i am 20 weeks pregnant and have had spots all through my pregnancy its all down to your hormones changing and alsi i have really dry skin so try to use a really good moisturizer and hope they will go when our bodys get back to normal.|`|N1IqgXfvaa	Aww my gosh yes i did terrible! Not with my first pregnancy with my son, just this one.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	Some women get a pregnancy glow while others break out with acne.  It is due to all the hormones but should level out soon.
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	The best thing you can do for your baby is to talk with him often and read to him as much as he wants.  Show him new things, tell him what you're doing, and let him experience as much of his world as possible.<br>  <br>  For example, involve your child at the grocery store.  If he's riding in the cart, talk about what foods you're going to buy that day.  Let him sniff and touch the fresh fruits/veggies you put in the cart.  Let him taste any samples that are available.  Count how many apples you're putting in the bag.  Talk about what colors/textures the foods are.  Show him the packaging on foods, and read the words to him.  (My oldest used to crack up whenever we read "Sweet Golden Corn" off a can of corn.  I don't know why, but it struck her as funny.  :-)  )  Let him touch the frozen foods, and tell him that they're cold.  If he gets bored waiting for the cashier, sing "Itsy Bitsy Spider," "The Wheels on the Bus," the alphabet song, or anything else he likes.<br>  <br>  At home, play with balls, blocks, trucks, and dolls.  Play chase and peek-a-boo.  Once he's a little older, you can try crayons and play-doh.  Sing lots of songs and do finger plays.  <br>  <br>  Let him be with you and watch what you're doing -- cooking, cleaning, folding laundry, etc.  Let him help whenever possible.  Give him his own washcloth, towel, mop (once he can walk), bowl and spoon, etc. so that he can imitate you.  <br>  <br>  My kids are now 5, 4, and 18 months, and they're doing great.  The more involved you are, the more they learn.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	hide and seek, my daughter loves this...i hide behind the sofa, side od the couch etc.<br>  ball games sit him in front of you and roll the ball to him and try and teach him to roll it back...use different sizes froma tennis ball to a kids football for eye hand coordination. hide objects places ie his favourite teddy under his blanket...its so cute my daughters shocked look when she finds stuff is priceless lol that game also told her how to say all gone and these days she insists on hiding herself and saying ebbas all gone (her name is emma) haha!|`|fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	My 2 and 4 yo both like singing songs with me. I think back to that age and i think wrestling was a big hit. rolling around and laughing was always a blast.<br>  <br>  Trust me, playing with matches may seem fun, but you will regret it.<br>  <br>  Ditto guns, knives, and electrical sockets.<br>  <br>  Dont believe the hype. Sure the kid gets exctied, but these things just suck.|`|USoEhJ37aa	they have awesome toys on the baby einstein website :<a href="http://babyeinstein.com." rel="nofollow">http://babyeinstein.com.</a> Another one I like is finger puppets! and things with details, that will stimulate his vision and perception.
ROJans2Taa	I was diagnosed with a blighted ovum when I was 7 weeks pregnant, i had spotting from about 5 weeks, at 6 weeks they found a sac but no fetus, went back at 7 weeks and it was confirmed, I only spotted when id wipe, when I got pregnant 4 mths after, I started spotting and cramping again at 5 weeks, the bleeding became heavier, I thought I was miscarrying again, U/S found fetus with heartbeat, my son is 6 mths now, it's scary but things can work out. best luck|`|rPbyDmjYaa	I had a miscarriage at 8 weeks in Aug 08.  My husband and I had sex, and I cramped a little the next day.  I called the doctor and they said it was ok and completely normal to cramp a little and spotting a little.  I was still uneasy about it.  Needless to say 2 days later, i was sleeping and woke up with worse cramps, felt just like a bad period, and I ended up having a natural miscarriage.  So personally I don't think any bleeding is normal and you need to call the doctor.|`|RVW5CdK0aa	hiya hunnie<br>  u really need to get that check cloths is one of the signs of <br>  a miscarriage occurring whether its now or later.i had one in november and dat how it started aswel|`|Hu9yquP4aa	It depends. <br>  <br>  You need to contact your doctor and they will do testing. <br>  I had a miscarriage at 10 weeks and 19. <br>  I had light bleeding that went into heavy bleeding.|`|a1uoxczTaa	i think you need to ask a doctor instead of us.
s4LWmcTjaa	Actually yes I might *consider* it, but then she would have even more reason and opportunity to go out and have sex without consequence.<br>  <br>  To me, I don't want that to give her the green light and say "Oh look I can have sex and not worry about it at all!"<br>  <br>  Temporary sterilization doesn't prevent AIDS, other STDs, heart break and emotional problems.<br>  <br>  My form of birth control for my kids is as follows:  Hand my teens an aspirin and say "Hold this between your knees for the next 5-6 years".  LOL :)  (ha ha, funny?)<br>  <br>  *ETA*<br>  By the way, just wanted to say tell your husband thank you for serving our country and thank you for backing him on the home front!  From one military wife to another :)  My husband has been out for almost 2 years now.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Why not teen sons as well? I don't have any daughters, so is it okay to allow my boys to get girls pregnant because they don't have to carry it? Teen girls don't get themselves pregnant, they should be the only ones taking precautions.<br>  <br>  Edit: That should sshould be shouldn't.|`|a8IRxC4raa	No, I would sterilize the boys who like her.  <br>  <br>  All the best.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	actually teen pregnancy rates are going down<br>  no i would not.  its her uterus not mine|`|92iuiuZKaa	No, thats just wrong!|`|prqrQcd1aa	Since you can't temporarily sterilize someone as of yet with out there being harm done possibly permanently i have to go with no..<br>  You teach them from an early age about sex and all the things that go along with it, and you let them sit for a new born for a night...that may just stop them in their tracks.. You also keep lines of communication open so that they can come and talk to you about things like this and if needed they can get on the pill. I know most of us hate thinking about that, but i'd rather be open with my kid about sex and have her on the pill and tell her to use condoms than to have her come home and tell me she has a STD that can't be cured or else that she is pregnant!|`|t1fx6kXcaa	No. As others have said, sterilisation won't prevent STDs Sterilising your son/daughter against their wishes is also a violation of their human rights. I also believe that if you talk openly about sex and don't make it a taboo subject, than your teenager is less likely to engage in sexual activity.|`|veO1RXrCaa	Nope I would not do that.  I do not have a daughter yet.  (this baby is unkwown)  I would hope that she would trust me enough to ask if she wanted to go on the pill etc.  I hope that my influence would help steer her in the right direction.  I feel the same way with my son.  I hope he trusts me enough to to be able to talk to me and learn to be responsible.|`|65RZ441Zaa	The facts are sad, but teens are miss guided. The need proper education, and birth control if needed. TALK TALK TALK. If you know what her friends are doing, you'll know what she's at least thought about doing. My answer is no. It's ridiculous, If your teen is out of control and won't listen, send her to an all girls school, move out of town, isolate her!!!|`|DC64wxBeaa	I keep mistaking the word sterilize for neutralise lol, that's quite a good idea though I'd like to temporarily turn off some people who annoy me.  Anyway no I wouldn't because you should trust your daughter not to, but if your worried I guess I wouldn't mind.|`|sDAnuaBYaa	No, but I will have no problem with her going on the pill if  she wants to. She'll get no judgment from me.|`|AA11537580	no, she could not get pregnant but she could get an STI or AIDS|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	No
irLnPW4aaa	Health Insurance.   Baby will generally be covered under whatever insurance plan covers mom for the first 30 days, but before that time is up, you need to get baby added to your family plan.  This is likely to cause an increase of some amount in the cost of your insurance coverage (if this is your first baby).... 'family' plan is more than just the 'couple with no children' plan most of the time.  Check with your insurance company (or employer) to find out how much the $$ difference is.  When my first child was born, it was a difference of almost $150 per month, but when my second child was born there was no increase.|`|faPKwClPaa	Ok, for the doctor visits and hospital stay, most all of that will (or should) be covered by insurance, so don't sweat that.<br>  <br>  The clothes, cribs, accessories, etc. can cost as much or as little as you want.  Also keep in mind that a good amount of that stuff will be bought for you either via excited family members and/or a baby shower.  On average, I'd say we spent about $2,500 on that ourselves.<br>  <br>  The REAL budgeting comes when the little one arrives.  I would say we spend about $1,500 a month on expenses from childcare (day care) to formula, food, random toys, and so forth.  Keeping in mind, however, that I live in an expensive part of the country.<br>  <br>  I think you're smart to budget.  Kids are wonderful, but they are expensive, and I'd much rather budget or save up than live in near-poverty and have fights over finances with my spouse.|`|6L9jJnchaa	Make sure you have REALLY good insurance to cover the medical bills.  As for everything else, here is a neat little calculator I found to calculate all teh costs from baby's first year.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.i-am-pregnant.com/encyclopedia/Babies/Baby-Cost-Calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.i-am-pregnant.com/encyclopedi...</a>|`|5d4e887ca959e59c94f23e2dba055e2faa	wow! i see that you're trying to drive yourself crazy. imagine raising a child from birth to the age of 18, you'll need all of Brad Pitts and Angelina Jolie's money  but since you not gonna need it all at once you'll do fine don't let money keep you from experiencing the joy of fatherhood. trust me.|`|iOSEVRPPaa	You can save a ton a month if your wife would breastfeed instead of using formula.  Formula is expensive!  Plus, you have to buy all the bottles, cleaning equipment, etc.|`|vcxdTXbraa	Trust me you will never be financially ready for a child but if you really want children you will make it work|`|AA11785285	After medical costs, (ranging of $3000-$6000) for a normal uncomplicated delivery, the costs to you will be in the range of $1000 per month... a little less in the beginning, and more as your child ages.  \<br>  <br>  By the time you and she have raised this child for almost 2 decades to age 18 , you will have invested $250,000 (a Yahoo figure several months ago) for nothing extra.....<br>  <br>  No braces, no private art or music lessons, no trips to Italy for art, no symphony tickets, no RVing, no camping, no horses, nada, hon... just the bare essentials, according to Yahoo, of "a belly of cheap food, tv, and computer, some meth, mj and dope in hs, and a cell phone".<br>  <br>  If your child shows any special talents in art, or music, this is not included.  If your child needs any special care, medications, treatments, etc., as well, this is not included.<br>  <br>  Helpful?|`|LwbwMFX9aa	i hope this isnt your homework you need done for a class<br>  <br>  it depends if you have insurance or not on the dr visits and stuff<br>  <br>  all this depends on what you want to spend, pacifiers not needed, baby fornula not needed, breastfeed if you can that will save you lots of money<br>  <br>  cribs depends on how cheap you want to be, it all does,  from birth to 18 it costs about 185k to araise a child from the last numbers i saw
F7tyzrMzaa	Trust me, not feminine at all. Any little girl called Grayson, I feel sorry for. Grayson is a masculine name meaning "son of..." <br>  <br>  Don't worry about people calling him Gracie. I doubt they will. I'd call a person named Grayson "Gray." <br>  <br>  It's a lovely name by the way, and John is a great middle name for it.|`|zwaXYoRbaa	Don't do that to your son. Find the most masculine name you can. The fact that you have to ask, means that you have a doubt and with good reason. <br>  .<br>  Yes, the name Grayson is too feminine for a boy.<br>  .<br>  PS: even if it ends in son, It sounds too much like Gay son.<br>          Also,..wait til kids find out "the boy wonder's" (Robin's)     <br>          name is Dick Grayson. <br>  PPS: I also love how it's the girls who are all telling you it's a   <br>            sweet name, a lovely name,....or  "It's a cute name,....   <br>            for a boy". You know,..That poor boy has to become a  <br>            man one day.|`|igvUbqkyaa	I don't think it is too feminine, but I do see your concern with the whole 'Gracie' thing, which would be awful for a boy to be called haha. I just personally don't care for the name - just not very attractive in my opinion.|`|786401de1d5450afed620aa842e4adeaaa	No, I don't think it's feminine. I think names ending in 'n' or 'son' are masculine sounding. <br>  <br>  I like the name by the way. No one will call him Gracie. They'll know him as Grayson or Gray. <br>  <br>  You have my vote for the name.|`|LGidAYDwaa	I love the name Grayson. I considered it for my son, who ended up with the name Bryson. :-)  I don't think it's feminine at all.  (Esp since "Grayson" means "Gray's son".)|`|qitXGd0qaa	I dated a Grayson in high school, nothing girly about him. I love the nickname Gray. Congrats.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	i know a guy named Grayson.  it isn't too feminine.|`|w7FSmSTnaa	no it dont sound feminine at all|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I have a coworker with a son named Grayson, but I used to work at a clinic and there were several little girls that were patients there named Gracin/Gracyn. So, I think it is a little feminine. I don't care for it much as a boy's name.<br>  <br>  But if YOU love it, then that's what you should use. It's not "out there" at all, not offensive, just a matter of taste. And there isn't any one name that EVERYONE will like. It's fine- go for it.|`|HMPdnhApaa	I would not think of calling a boy named Grayson "Gracie" so I wouldn't worry about kids teasing him with that. If kids are going to be picked on or are not well liked, kids will find something or other to tease about anyway..so I say if you want to use it, use it!! :)|`|61NKzPzMaa	Grayson is a masculine BOYS name. How is that feminine? It ends in SON. Boys are SONS. Girls are daughters.<br>  <br>  People would probably call him Gray. I would.|`|qJKqDPqMaa	I think that is the cutest name for a boy and if i were you i would defiently name my son that. :)|`|Tm3ItIuvaa	It's a boy's name.|`|OU9xnW86aa	I don't think it's a feminine name.

I do not like the nickname your going to give him.|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	I love this name and I think that they will not tease him about his name or call him Gracie.|`|CTmWS6dMaa	I don't think it's feminine.|`|6BdI1xnPaa	No body will call hime Gracie!|`|gFiRi5xnaa	I associate it as a boys name.|`|psDSVWpKaa	it's not feminine at all i like it|`|VISJdrMraa	no, i know like three dudes with that name. i actually like|`|QdkJYcpFaa	No its not too femmy|`|47M20WOUaa	Nope its a great name go for it :)|`|hpC2Y8WNaa	i don't think so, but that's my opinion.<br>  i know a girl named grayson and a boy named gracin.<br>  and gracin has never been teased about his name.<br>  <br>  maybe if you try a different spelling of grayson, it won't be feminine at all.|`|ku5NPnkfaa	Its a boy name.|`|TCpPdqcBaa	Oh Lord no!!! Grayson is definitely a masculine name. It is very handsome for a little boy. Not feminine at all! It is my nephew's name, except his is spelled Graison. His nickname is also Gray. He gets compliments on it all the time. It's a great name!|`|hMMU02iuaa	It's not feminine at all. I know a guy who's name is Stacie, how do u think he feels lol. <br>  Grayson is a nice name, and if u like it, there's no reason to question it.|`|HvoOeTVuaa	Anyone who would call your SON Gracie is an idiot!

There are numerous ways she could have been charged or ticketed.|`|N2p30Mo4aa	i could see it just being a ticket if it was a young teen.  Only because the teen could've agreed (or came up with the idea) and the cop caught them, wrote a ticket for being dumb.<br>  <br>  But a toddler involved? That mom should have her kids taken from her, and that cop should have his/her badge taken for only writing a ticket.

R7MD0WByaa	Talk to your doctor, but keep in mind that ANY kind of medication or supplement has some risk.  And often times, there simply isn't enough research to prove that it has no side effects.  So, I say, don't take it, and maybe seek high fiber foods to help out.  If the constipation is very serious though, talk to your doctor.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	It's fine, but I doubt it will help your constipation. Don't drink too much of it, because you can get too many vitamins.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I wouldn't- it has artificial sweeteners in there too. I would try eating more apples. The fiber in the apples should help with constipation too.|`|zRQmWC5saa	I wouldn't b/c too much protein will make ur baby have some kind of birth defect. I would stick with fruit and salads for constipation.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	well I would talk to your doctor about this I think it is fine but instead of drinking this water why not try bran cereal that might help better and will be better for the baby|`|q2SEEXeqaa	if you get drunk while you are prego your baby will be born with a hang over and his nick name will be drunkie.
5Z4ivxpaaa	I think you can absolutely use the name!  I think it's a nice name.  I never even thought of Forrest Whittaker and the kids he will be going to school with won't really be using "Run Forrest" anymore because the movie will be an "old movie" by then and not part of pop culture the way it was a while back.  So I personally think you are safe.  There are also so many "weird" names that are being used nowadays that he will not be teased because of the fact that it's different.  If you like the name, I'd definitly use it... unless of course your last name makes it unusable.  If your last name starts with an "F" or rhymes with Forrest, then you might want to reconsider.  Especailly since men are stuck with their first and last names for life.  Good luck!|`|7akG7iRPaa	um the name is nice i was engaged to a guy named forrest. just a warning people will make fun of him if you name him that. some nicknames he would get called is frost. frosty, woods (wrong sayin he isnt man enough to be forrest) i think thats all i can member... it is a cute name tho|`|edLbogmYaa	I like that it's not a real popular name. But beware he WILL get made fun of bc of the movie there no question about it. If you kid is on a track and field team they are def. gonna scream run forrest run...|`|hpC2Y8WNaa	i think you should spell it forest.<br>  if you take out an "r" it won't seem like it's from forrest gump.<br>  however, i do like the name and i know a boy named forest. he doesn't get teased!<br>  so go for it!|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	I love this name but personally I would use it as a middle name, I think that the kids will make fun of him because of it as the other posters have said.|`|ElUx86Rcaa	Imagine when he does sports at school...<br>  <br>  Especially when he does running.<br>  <br>  <br>  "Ruuuuuun Forrest ruuuuuun!"|`|2uOhDMKjaa	MIDDLE NAME MATERIAL! It is out dated now, let alone 20 years from now. people will be calling him "Gump" and like "Jennnay"|`|i3FgiLENaa	Gump, I wouldn't to it, there are better names out there anyway|`|QdkJYcpFaa	Yeah Its a good name. I used to date a guy named Forrester and I called him Forrest for short lol|`|jUlsH8Myaa	poor child!! <br>  I would consider it as a middle name but not as a first name.|`|psDSVWpKaa	I'm middle schooling and I think he would get made fun of when he gets older. it is an old name to me|`|zRQmWC5saa	if u want lil kids to make fun of him , yes great name! they will call him forrest gump!|`|MWGRlJfZaa	i have a friend who's name is forrest he is 20.|`|5CiAFdbsaa	anything is a usable name now really, i like it.|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	I think it is fine to use.  Forrest Gump didn't even come to mind until you mentioned it.  So go with it if you like it!|`|TCpPdqcBaa	I think Forrest is a nice name. I have a friend named Forrest and it suits him well. I don't think any name is necessarily unusable, unless it's Adolf or something terrible like that. Kids can find a way to make fun of any name... Forrest is a really nice name though, and I think if you love it- use it!|`|4BBjhHAnaa	It's a great name.  I think you might be able to use it.  Anyone who is currently between the ages of say, 10-30, might get/have gotten, some jokes made about their name.  But, by the time any kid born now is old enough for other kids to know about the movie, it will be really outdated and I don't think many will have seen it.|`|HvoOeTVuaa	I think it's a great name and any child who is raised to be happy and confident should have no problem with that name.<br>  <br>  Besides, the character Forrest Gump is so lovable!  It's not like you are naming him a name of some mean and really bad character.|`|ObKqyZ7haa	prob not a good idea|`|bmoCpcdraa	i think it would make a Very good middle name, dear|`|K1M2ujKbaa	No matter what you name him he will be made fun of at some point. i would use it as a middle name and by the time he's in his teen years he can go by Forrest. Just keep him away from 50 year old ex footballers still screaming "Run Forrest" cause they will probably be around still (sigh). I still love the name.|`|igvUbqkyaa	You must have loved that name for a while - Forrest Gump is a pretty old movie now - it was made in like '94 I think! But it isn't horrible but definitely not ideal - he will definitely get a lot of "Run, Forrest, Run"s in his lifetime!!|`|F7tyzrMzaa	One of my best friends is called Forrest and he's 15. I think it's a great name. A film can't make a name unusable. I love the name Ferris, like Ferris Bueller's Day Off.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	i have a good friend named Forrest and he is in his 20s.  i think the name is just fine.|`|xO2TIwsJaa	I like the name Forest, I had a really good friend that was named Forest.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just don't spell it with two R's. It looks wrong spelled that way.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I think the movie has been out long enough now that it's ok.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Sure.|`|6BdI1xnPaa	I like it!
Lnt4u4q6aa	Depends on the kid, but if he is walking, he may not want to be held much. <br>   Since you are also a stranger, he may not want you holding him just yet, anyway.<br>  The best thing to do is get down on the floor at his level and let him come to you when he is ready.  At some point he will climb onto your lap and then it will be wonderful.  You will realize he loves you.  Take it from there.  Dont try to force the relationship.<br>  <br>  When you do lift him, always hold him under his arms ( armpits ).  Never lift by the arm. I have seen so many dislocated elbows from this<br>  Enjoy your new sibling :).|`|XOtOMncwaa	Well in all honestly you really can't hold a one year old, not for enjoyment like you do a newborn. 1 year old don't really like to be held, at least mine doesn't... when I do hold him I hold him on my hip, if that makes sense. But the only time he ever lets me hold him now is when were heading to the car or something like that.<br>  Congrats that's exciting!|`|EeGgovyCaa	Against your side with your arm under his bottom. So he/she is sitting on your forearm. The with your other hand, you support his back so he/she doesn't fall or jerk backwards.|`|c73QkZ2haa	With your arms.. :D|`|a1uoxczTaa	just hold him/her on your hip. arms wrapped around him/her.<br>  <br>  *like arm around their back  so their armpit is on or near your shoulder. then you can place your other arm under their other armpit.|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	Have your mum show you!  She's already a pro!|`|WlU3NFu6aa	at one years old you dont have to worry about holding then right or wrong. if you've seen people carry babies with their hand under their head, thats how you carry a newborn cause their necks arent strong enough to support their own head.<br>  a one yr old should be sitting on his own, crawling, possibily walking. you can hold him anyway tahts comfortable for both of you. <br>  congrats and good luck!|`|7bdhpvc9aa	Most one year olds are able to sit up by themselves and walk around so holding the one year old isn't really an issue because he/she will be able to position themselves whichever way feels comfortable to them. Congrats on getting a new baby sister/brother. God Bless
Ccq8zEcnaa	No that's not a bad thing, love your baby belly as much as you want.. That's one of the joys that come with pregnancy.|`|cO6BD3hVaa	if you're seriously asking this question, then you are seriously not prepared to be a mother.|`|PfIywLLyaa	You are fine!|`|GEYaHwTTaa	no|`|yo9XNz61aa	I dont see how it would be bad?  I kinda miss my belly :(  If it wasnt ok to touch your belly then you couldnt rub that wonderful stretch mark cream all over it! Enjoy!|`|FYDw1rjlaa	no, you can touch your belly as much as you want.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	are you serious? Why wouldn't it be??!! duh!|`|dDVAUA9saa	Have to agree with first answer.<br>  <br>  I am always shocked by how paranoid people are when they get pregnant, it cracks me up!!
SEzIkGNiaa	I charge 5 dollars an hour and I am certified.  For an overnight, I would add 15-20 on top.|`|DgCsBWk9aa	well since its not by the hour , its a days worth of baby sitting<br>  i would suggest to pay her a flat rate of about $80-$100|`|1xr6T6h0aa	Well, I am 27.  I usually get between 150-200 for an overnight, depending upon how many children and how long I am working.<br>  <br>  My most recent job I worked from 6pm-11am and I was paid $175 and felt it was fair for 2 children.<br>  <br>  For vacations with families, I usually get about 750/week for 24 hour a day and they pay all my food, fees, airlines tix, hotel, etc... <br>  <br>  Hope that helps ;)|`|B2VdqdVQaa	i would say around 15-20 dollars an hour.  Because the child is so young it is a lot of pressure. If they were around 3 years old, you might be able to go with a lower price|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i am not sure where you live, that could make a difference, but i wouldnt pay anything less then 10$ an hour but more like 15$ an hour is the going rate here.|`|4wdg0ELAaa	I would give her $100 evry time she babysits
fYMWDQLGaa	sounds like an implantation bleeding... goodluck hun...|`|gwuTKiNXaa	sound like one of two things implantation bleeding or he may have hit something too hard and knocked  something loose...|`|OG661H9qaa	It sounds like you had implantation bleeding.I have read impantation bleeding implantation bleeding occurs when an egg has been fertilized and implants into the lining of the uterus. Because the lining uterus is made up of blood, there can be a bit of blood expelled in some women. <br>  Wait for few days and then go for a home pregnancy test You could be pregnant..baby dust N keep us posted:)|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	This is what is happening to me it might just be implantation bleeding!! <br>  check out the link i sent you! i hope it helps and good lucK!! <br>  <br>  *** TONS OF BABY DUST***
y6g0RnuAaa	Okay... she is 14! That sounds totally normal and typical for a girl her age. I am not condoning it and it is not acceptable but I think a simple conversation once you both were cooled down would have worked. As a teenager she is probably thinking even more in her head some swear words about you...lol (making this more likely to happen again.) In her mind, that was the easy way to vent her frustration with you and this compounds that frustration.<br>  <br>  While it may be between you and your daughter, her father need to back you up- whether he agrees with the punishment or not. Must be nice to take the easy road.<br>  <br>  This is just my humble opinion of course. I wouldn't keep her from her father though- that just complicates it.|`|prqrQcd1aa	It's kind of hard to punish a child from their father just because of something she did, i understand your concern about the father allowing her to do what she wants to do, but it's not fair to her father to keep her away because she swore at you.. Is there anything else you could take away... If it were my child I would have taken away watching television for a whole day before she was even due to go to her dad's house. That way there is no conflict there.|`|AA11203456	ive never believed in grounding it just makes your kids mad at you and they dont learn.  next time tell her you'll take her to shrink if she keeps it up!<br>  <br>  or make her do chores around the house and outside but never ground her from tv shows or friends they wont learn that way.|`|2Y9U5jlGaa	no i think u should let him have her but when she comes over to ur house next time say that the punishment is still on when she comes over to your house|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	So what if she swore, adults swear all the time, no one cares, your boss doesn't exactly refuse to pay you for the month because you swore at them. I bet you said your fair share of rude comments in that argument as well.<br>  <br>  Why make her Dad pay as well? Especially over something as stupid swearing, that isn't going to teach her anything, you're acting just as childish by throwing such hissy fit over it.|`|7lTIiL60aa	umm first off depending on what she said yes it is disrespectful but she was prob really fusterated and wasent swaring at u but at the situation second never ever ever use the outher parent as leverge that is just wrong he is her parent to and it is his choice if he allowes her to watch it but never ground a kid from there parent|`|yKS2UI87aa	It sucks he can't be on the same page with you about punishment. I think that is a totally acceptable punishment. Maybe he can have her sit in her room so she can't see/hear it and he can still watch?|`|CwNMq7RTaa	I don't think you have the right to not let her see her father for any reason.  Think of another punishment that he cannot interfere with.|`|M2yERqNSaa	soap in the mouth<br>  if you were any kind of parent you would be with a good man and married instead of a low life you breeded with|`|VdTn7Gmbaa	Mother-daughter relationships are tough.<br>  I've seen my sister go through this.<br>  And I went through it with sons.<br>  If she is cursing at you, she is testing the waters.<br>  Restriction and punishment DO NOT always work, I know.<br>  There should be consequences for bad behavior,<br>  but not always in the way we think.<br>  Perhaps speak to the pastor or known counselor in your church.<br>  We can pray for them and not reward them for bad behavior.<br>  You cannot control what her father does.<br>  That's one thing I learned long ago.<br>  <br>  So we just pray and seek consult <br>  from those who are Godly and wise.<br>  That's what the Bible tells us to do.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here's something Dr. James Dobson said:<br>  <br>  "Don't throw away your friendship with your teenager over behavior that has no great moral significance. There will be plenty of real issues that require you to stand like a rock.

That's ridiculous.  He has nothing to do with this and is completely correct in saying that its between you and her.  Not allowing her to spend time with her father is not something that should be used as punishment.<br>  <br>  The t.v. show, sure, whatever.  Ground her from watching a show if you feel that is an appropriate punishment for cursing.  I think rather than worrying about a punishment though, you need to sit down with her and just have a talk about the appropriate way to speak to you when she is angry or upset.  About how cursing at someone is very rude and disrespectful.  That goes for you too though.  If you curse at her when you are angry or upset (or at other people), you can't really be all that surprised when she does the same.|`|bp6IeRg3aa	You should ignore her it may not work in the beginning but it'll work wonders by the end. The idea is if she can't speak properly to you then she can't speak to you at all. And not letting her see her father is over the top he doesn't have anything to do with it and if he doesn't agree with you them leave him be. Just let your daughter know that you are not going to let this go.|`|qI5W6eyjaa	I think she should still see her dad. You should try something that she can't get away with while she is at her dads. Like something she dose after school.|`|65RZ441Zaa	Its unfair to ground your daughter from her father. you should know that. As far as taking her show away for a month!, that seems harsh! She cursed, big deal if you want to teach her to hide her feeling and act out, keep punishing her over every little thing. <br>  <br>  She's 14, she will not always agree with you, she will get frustrated, she will roll her eyes, and likely may slam doors and yell. The oher option is for her to act out, and get into real trouble. Let her express herself, with boundaries. Don't start being too strict SHE WILL act out, and you'll see your relationship to start to dwindle .|`|NqWl2qlPaa	My husband thinks it's a bit much for a curse word, but I think she shouldn't be able to do anything, as far as seeing her father, as much as I hate to say it you have to. You can't prohibit their contact and you can't control what goes on at his house.  you need to tell your daughter what she did wrong, why it was wrong and how much it hurt you.  You also need to realize that people say things out of anger that they don't always mean.  Has she apologized to you without you telling her to?|`|cuLo1mGGaa	First talk to the dad about the punishment and let him know how you feel about it.  Not allowing her to see her dad would not be a good response to what happened.  Using that as a punishment would only alienate her more.  Try to get the dad to agree to the punishment explain to him that it was appropriate and not overly harsh, and what alternatives were available, i.e. no movies, free time with friends, fun things that could have been taken away for her conduct.  Finally sit down and talk to your daughter about the situation and try to make her understand how she could have responded better to what she was feeling.|`|kZqsWsv3aa	ok so you deffinatly shouldnt ground her from seeing her father, but when she returns continue the punishment and let her know cursing is way wrong! especially to an adult, more the reason her mother! She deserves punishment, im 15, but i pretty much have a child of my own, shes 8 (my lil' sister) but i let her know and punish her for anything she does wrong, so se doesn do it over. Take away anything or anyone she enjoys, and as well as letting her know your doing it so she knows its wrong and you do it because you love her. I know im only 15 but im overly mature for my age seeing as "my child" know i do it for her own good and still looks up to me.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	If that was my child, I'd hand her a tooth brush and tell her to scrub the toilet.  Sorry but she needs more than just a lost TV show in my opinion.<br>  <br>  However grounding her from seeing her father??  Too over the top.|`|92iuiuZKaa	First of all, I would have smacked her in the mouth. <br>  <br>  I would ground her for a couple of weeks. No hanging out with friends, no phone, no computer, & no whatever else she enjoys doing!<br>  <br>  edit- well if my child cursed me out I would not think twice about smacking them. thats a Big time No No to curse your parents out. But to each it's own
NqWl2qlPaa	My husband and I both agree that you need to call the police and have this man disbarred and in jail, it is unethical and wrong on so many levels and being a lawyer doesn't make him a good person, it just means he passed a test to be a lawyer.  this concept is ridiculous to us and it is immoral and you need to talk to your daughter about statutory rape, tell this guy to keep it moving on to someone his own age.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	#1- Job title does not equal good man<br>  #2- It's illegal (why would a lawyer risk so much for this reason alone)<br>  #3- Regarding your user name... who calls their kids "sexy" anyway?  Pretty, beautiful, handsome, nice looking- yes... but sexy???|`|NuvKPl3naa	my opinion!!!!!!!!!!!!! he is NOT a good man if he is dating a 16 year old CHILD. is that legal in your state???? i would stop it right away.|`|QveBSjFSaa	Dear Yahoo community,<br>  this is NOT a serious question. Look at all the inconsistencies.<br>  Please act accordingly.<br>  Love, <br>  Judo Knuckle<br>  <br>  to answer: I would do nothing short of trying to sell the publishing rights of this epic FICTIONAL work.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	your daughter is being molested by a lawyer! <br>  that is so illegal! !!!!!!!!|`|a8IRxC4raa	I would do one of two things:<br>  <br>  1) Press charges.<br>  <br>  2) Stop trolling.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|prqrQcd1aa	yeah, that's sick... want to include your name address by chance...I'd LOVE to report that one!|`|AA12174100	what this man does for a living has nothing to do with him dating your daughter. I feel concerned with your parenting abilities if you even begin to allow this. And your screen name  makes me concerned. You seem to have a warped parenting style...you are worried about bringing up bad memories for the grandmother and worried what her father would think and he's not involved in her life?|`|sqaey2Siaa	First off this man has to be a sicko..second off I wouldn't doubt if he were married and wanted a hot little "16 year old girl" to have sex with and send home to mommy at night. Point blank..good man or not, your 16 year old daughter has NO BUSINESS dating someone this much older.|`|glDiHaDeaa	maybe its cuz your name im Yahoo Answers is "mom of sexy teenagers"....wow.... looks like your a little late for appropriate parenting i can tell your the kind of mom who wants to be your daughter's best friend.....|`|lXaAFIHfaa	Your name is mom of sexy teenagers that explains it all right there!! Be a parent and take control of the situation!!|`|bMyq2nOTaa	Fake question... What kind of 'mother' uses the name 'mom of sexy teenagers'? I'll tell you who: a pervy MAN!|`|gCBqdHf2aa	Please ask yourself what a 16yr old and a 35yr old have in common. This doesn't sound right to me, I wouldn't allow it.|`|DaYqNCsNaa	This is a completely messed up situation.  You say you "know that he is a good man because he is a lawyer and makes a lot of money"  How does that constitute a good man?  He maybe financially stable but morally he is not!  You have said absolutely nothing about this character.  You're mother-in-law being molested by a lawyer is bad, but I don't see how, him being a lawyer should matter.  They were different people.  She should not generalize people based on their profession.  That is very ignorant, but that seems to be the theme of this question.  At least you had the "talk" with her because more than likely he is just using her for sex, which is completely inappropriate and ILLEGAL!  You need to separate the two of them ASAP.  Do not care what your daughter thinks!  You are suppose to look out for her safety and if you allow this to continue, you will be doing her harm!|`|abcef21f35c1b7e1c21c4f95d70f6632aa	UH I would call the cops,  this is your child and you are allowing a grown man to sleep with her and be with her.  Lawyer??? What does that have to do with anything,  oh great and you have given her condoms?  Parents now days don't have a clue,  I am sorry but my job is to protect my kids from harmful behavior and teach them right from wrong,  this is so wrong.   She is in high school still,  where is her innocence she should be focusing on friends and her education, not some 35 year old man who has been through way more life than she has.  What kind of pervert wants to be with a 16 year child anyways,  Don't you have any control over your parenting to say this is 100% wrong and you will stop or there will be severe consequences?|`|65RZ441Zaa	WTH does a 35 year old man want with YOUR 16 year old. I would keep her far away. Find out if he's married or what! He sounds like a creeper, there's obviously something wrong with him, because if he's 35years old and making good  money, she should be more appealing to WOMEN his own age. Don't be stupid, get her out of his control.|`|NzCuYRXFaa	I'd call the police.  If any 35 year-old man is dating a 16 year girl, regardless of his profession, it is sick.  How much do you really know about this man.  Is he really a lawyer or just pretending to be.  Call the police.|`|GPTGkgSsaa	I would not allow that to happen the is illegal and plus since he is a lawyer he should know that it is illegal.|`|Lr0eB6sSaa	do you really think its ok for your daughter to be dating a 35 year man <br>  come on your daughter isnt even an adult his old enough to be her father ..............|`|Ka7DlJOSaa	If he can't find someone his own age then he has a prob.  What are you thinking?  Just cuz he has money it's ok?  REALITY CHECK|`|AA12112469	After reading all the answers you were given so far, I would have to say you are a real idiot...I mean my God, what is wrong with you? I would also call the police and report this man. Of course, I realize that teenagers are going to do what they want to do regardless of how good a parent we are or aren't, anything we do or don't say. But this man is three times her age woman!!!!  But like someone else said, sounds like you are trying to be her friend. That NEVER works...trust me. There is a difference between relating to your teenagers and taking an interest in their ideals, etc....but gotta be a mom first...And, last, take a look at how you were at that age, what you dress and act like now...maybe YOU gave her the idea to date older men and dress inappropriately.....if all else fails, Ask God.
z3A8meCNaa	Omg that's horrible. I don't know, but definately talk to your mom! She sounds like she's reinforcing your nieces behavior and that is just not acceptable!  It doesn't matter if the man is her dad or not, he can still discipline her. Would she say that about a daycare provider?  Try signing up for nanny 911 or super nanny or something, I think you honestly need a professional to come in and help.  Best of luck, I do not envy you!  If anything, move out if you have the money.  That is just a horrible atmosphere.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	Wow, this problem sounds like it starts with her grandmother. Maybe she is mad at your sister for being with another man? Or she believes that the biological father should be the only one who raises his kid? The grandmother telling her not to listen to him is horrible. That's not how you treat someone who loves you and wants to take care of you. It sounds like some family counseling may be in order to figure out exactly what is going on.|`|2DKRF3qoaa	There is nothing you can do...... if she is 10. Let her get out of this her way. By 12-13, she will think that guys are ok, then by 13-14 you will need to help her beat them with a stick off of her.|`|Y8uqufezaa	I am ashamed to admit this but when I was a teenager I was almost that bad but I never hit my parents. I had to want help though to get it I found out that I was suffering from Sever Depression this sounds like it could be the same thing she may need counseling or yes you should try to get super nanny or nanny 911 to help because she does need professional help, and I know it's going to take a while it won't be over night. I think she really needs counseling for now that would be the best thing you probably don't want to tell her that she is going just try to make her think it's a doctors appointment she is dealing with a lot of emotions right now which she probably doesn't understand or know how to deal with I sure didn't, and it took me a long time of feeling depressed, if she crys very easly or seemingly for no reason, and gets mad over dumb things these are all signs of depression. I hope this helped a little bit, and I hope you'll be able to get her the help she needs.
AA11542929	is the baby.. lol.. its such a cute feeliing.. im a 1st time mom too.. i got worried thought i had the poops lol.. tmi.. congrats|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	I'd definitely say that's the baby.  I started feeling my baby move at 17 weeks (or I should say, notice that he was moving). :)  One day he just started kicking me.  I never felt the "bubbles" feeling until a few weeks after the kicks started.  And yes, they move a lot!  It doesn't feel like they slow down until maybe 27 weeks (for me, anyway) because they start running out of room.  Then it's more like they just shove their feet and hands around.  I always had a heel poking out my side. :)|`|vGHaYp6Naa	sounds like baby!!! and hell, at 20 weeks my son was tumbling around and kicking, like he was practicing for a marathon or something. its amazing. and i believe as long as you feel the baby, its fine. its when you dont feel it atleast once, you should be worried. cause i think the baby is still on the small side at 19 weeks....sounds fine to me!|`|duinadV4aa	yep it's the baby|`|4AZp8Quwaa	it's probably the baby. you should definitely be feeling the baby move by now. it does feel very similar to bubbles popping in your tummy, or little butterfly like waves of movement. when i first started feeling it, i couldn't stop laughing or smiling from how happy it made me feel every time i felt her move. : )|`|bfDFWqc5aa	At 16 weeks the babies movement may feel like little flutters, gas bubbles, or even like popcorn popping. Over the following weeks they'll grow stronger and you'll be able to feel them much more frequently.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It is most likely the baby. :) Some of it gas, but most of it baby.<br>  <br>  Babies are actually VERY active starting pretty early. They are moving and kicking around at 10 weeks, you just can't feel them.|`|QOvUS6xVaa	its a feeling you just cant describe

1VnWhP1Saa	I have four children and it's been just as exciting with each one, each child brings their own charms & challenges to family life thats all part of the fun. But the added bonus is your much more confident in your parenting skills which lets your relax & enjoy your baby that much more|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	mine are 14 months apart and they get along so well. I am so glad that I had them so close although they we both precious surprises. Not so much fun when they both start on the cry baby cry orchestra.

Its actually more fun because you don't have all those first time jitters.  You aren't worrying and scared about every teeny tiny little thing.  You have experience on your side so you can just simply relax and enjoy having a new little bundle of joy rather than worrying about what to do or not to do.  You also already have all the supplies that a baby needs, so you aren't frantically running to the store to pick up last minute items or to buy something you didn't realize you'd need.  Its wonderful.|`|WD42CUUkaa	Well, to be honest i was a second child and i was a hyper powerhouse nightmare for my parents at a young age. Now i am much better though. <br>  From what i know the second tends to be the problematic one, but it is better than having only one child, because they will always have someone to play with.|`|tnOZ49JQaa	I had my first baby in Aug. 2005 and 18 months later I had my second. I feel like I missed some of the things with my first because I was so busy with my new baby. We had planned on waiting, but it just happened. Now they are 3 1/2 and 2 and we have all kinds of fun. My second learned things faster because of my older son. It's not easy but they're getting to do a lot of things together. Hope this helps!!|`|YCtvI9eqaa	I'm not speaking for all mothers,but as for me, I had my 2 with 14 mon. apart..The first child had pictures and video galore taken, unfortunately, the second had some, but nothing compared to the first. I woke up everyday just thinking I needed to survive the mother load..lol. Needless to say, they are now ages 8 and 9 and both are very special..Good luck to yo with your life :)|`|ukjxFnqDaa	My second child was a delight. I really enjoyed having him. He was a bit salty at first but as soon as i introduced some Worcester Sauce and a big old Naan bread he basically melted in my mouth.<br>  I am presuming you meant eating your babies?<br>  Much Love xx|`|DBrNaYNyaa	less worry. dont watch every lil thing you eat. Benn through it all before and know all about it.
RuyLwzA0aa	I have had a period every two weeks for almost a year.  If it just happens once you can blame on 100 different things.  Its more than that- you should see your dr.  I have PCOS and bleed every two weeks because of a hormonal imbalance.  I have read that it can also be caused by endo, cysts, or other fairly serious things.  Good Luck!|`|C7nnLPX6aa	The same thing happened to me!!<br>  I had one February 7th 2009 and now another on February 26, I did feel like I was pregnant but AF showed, it is heavier than usual too and theres a funny throbbing where my uterus is too|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	same thing here! i had mine feb 4th-about the 11th. and i started spotting on the 23rd again.. weird.. =[ Keep us posted on what your doctor says I'm curious bc I have never had a double period before! good luck!|`|gwuTKiNXaa	because this is such a short month that could have confused your body or your cycle is trying to switch around on you. Which can happen at times
vue9NOhYaa	This really isn't a problem.  He doesn't yet need solids.<br>  <br>  Some babies aren't interested in solids until they can feed themselves.  Your baby will probably be ready to self-feed pretty soon, so I wouldn't force or trick him. (Forcefeeding a baby is NEVER a good idea.)<br>  <br>  Try offering some table foods.  If he's not quite ready, try again in a week or two.  In the meantime, all he needs is breastmilk or formula.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	My second didn't swallow anything until nearly 10 months old, and while he loved to taste food he would freak out if he couldn't spit it out and I would have to clean his mouth out for him.<br>  <br>  Normal, healthy babies are developmentally ready for solids between 6-9 months, babies with allergies may refuse solids until 12 months or later.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://askdrsears.com/faq/bf4.asp" rel="nofollow">http://askdrsears.com/faq/bf4.asp</a><br>   I also have found that some infants are not developmentally ready for solids until 8 or 9 months. You can click here to read about what signs to watch for to determine when your infant is ready for foods. Breast milk is nutritionally complete for at least the first year of life. This means that infants can go for at least a year on breast milk alone, without eating any foods, and be nutritionally complete. Offering foods between 6 and 12 months of age is simply for social development and to get infants used to eating.<br>  <br>  I encourage parents not to try to coax their 6 month old into accepting solids before he shows many of the signs of being ready. This can create a picky eater and negative feelings about eating. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/FAQ/solids.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/FAQ/solids.html</a><br>  Babies who are ready for solids can usually feed themselves. Mothers often report that they knew their babies were ready when they picked up food from a plate, chewed it, swallowed it, and wanted more.<br>  <br>  Listen to your baby! Babies with a tendency to allergies may refuse solids until later in their first year. As long as they are growing well and are happy and healthy, there is no need for concern.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/solids-when.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  Solids readiness depends on both the maturity of baby’s digestive tract and baby’s developmental readiness for solids. Although the maturity of baby’s digestive system is not something that we can readily observe, research indicates that 6 months appears to be ideal for avoiding the allergies and other health risks of too-early solids. After this point, different babies are ready for solids at different times -- developmental readiness for solids cannot be determined using a calendar. Most babies are developmentally ready for solids somewhere between 6 and 8 months.<br>  Signs that indicate baby is developmentally ready for solids include:<br>  <br>      * Baby can sit up well without support.<br>      * Baby has lost the tongue-thrust reflex and does not automatically push solids out of his mouth with his tongue.<br>      * Baby is ready and willing to chew.<br>      * Baby is developing a “pincer” grasp, where he picks up food or other objects between thumb and forefinger. Using the fingers and scraping the food into the palm of the hand (palmar grasp) does not substitute for pincer grasp development.<br>      * Baby is eager to participate in mealtime and may try to grab food and put it in his mouth.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/3/T032000.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/3/T032000...</a><br>  I'm not sure if my baby is ready. Should I try offering solids anyway?Is your baby both ready and willing to try solid foods? Here's how to tell. If your baby eagerly opens his mouth when he sees a spoonful of food coming toward him, he is probably both ready and willing. If he turns away, he's not.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/solids-when.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  Is there a "window of opportunity" for starting solids?<br>  <br>  There is certainly a "window of opportunity" for starting solids, but this varies widely from baby to baby. At some point (usually around 6-8 months) baby will become developmentally ready to eat solid foods (able to sit up, chew, pick up food, etc.). At around the same age, the gastrointestinal tract is physiologically mature enough to handle a diversity of foods. At this point, most healthy babies will be ready and willing to eat (even if it's only occasionally and in tiny amounts).<br>  <br>  Occasionally, parents will be told that baby must start solids by 6 months (or 8 months, or 10 months) or baby will have problems learning to accept and eat foods that require chewing. This "limited window of opportunity" idea is widely believed, but unproven.<br>  <br>  I've not been able to find any research data to support the idea that there is a limited window of opportunity for introducing solids in normally developing, healthy children. There does appear to be some limited evidence that babies who have been tube-fed long-term or have serious developmental delays may have problems learning to eat if they don't get a chance to practice eating solids between 6 & 10 months. A small study involving case studies of several mentally retarded children was done back in 1964 (Illingworth RS, Lister J. The critical or sensitive period, with special reference to certain feeding problems in infants and children. J Pediatr 1964;65(6) part 1:839-48.). This study suggested that there may be a "critical and/or sensitive" period for introducing chewable textures to these children, and if solids are not introduced during this time, an important developmental milestone may be missed (possibly leading to rejection of solids later on).|`|OpJhrtjDaa	I agree with pippin.... your previous answer. <br>  <br>  My mother used to tell me, when they're ready; they'll let you know. After raising 4 children and now grandchildren, I believe she was right. Every child is different. I would continue to put it in front of him and let him try... maybe instead of trying to spoon feed him. I also believe all they really need is breast milk for the first year.
21LiTNVsaa	You can do that stuff but it wont help if the baby is not ready to come out. I feel you on that, I am 38 weeks too and i was 50% effaced, but i am still not dilated, and i have to make some progress before she will induce me, so I know how you feel, but there is really nothing you can do but wait. it is so uncomfortable to be this pregnant|`|P6FK3cG8aa	hey,u need not worry.go to the hospital when your body shows the symptoms of labor.by the way,don't strain your body.be in whichever position you are comfortable with.please don't stay in a single position continuously.and about having sex,it is not advisable to have it now..walking is good...do such things which can provide struggle less exercise to you so that your labor is without any complication.|`|v3LnJycKaa	you can not just walk into L&D unless your dr has scheduled you for an induction, thats hogwash. Anyway not at all, sex and walking is good for the body and mind and if it brings on labor then your baby is ready to come out, as it wont work if your body and baby arent ready. <br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|PfIywLLyaa	I don't think it is bad for you to have sex and walk to try and move labor along. Heck, it will be awhile before you can have sex so enjoy it now! But I wouldn't push anything too much - he/she will come when they are ready!|`|WLtsumGBaa	if the dr. told you that you can go into labor already , then that means you can walk right into L&D and say that ur dr. told you to come in. my sisters dr. told her that too and she walked right over and they started her on pitocin, (the stuff they put in your IV bag to start contractions)she had her baby 6 hours later =)<br>  <br>  <br>  she had him 02/12/2009, a healthy 8lb 5oz beautiful and healthy baby boy =')|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I think you need to be strong and hang in there. Take it easy and rest.The longer your baby stays in the better it is for their lungs. You can try to use a birthing ball, go for walks, get your partner to rub your ankles, nipple stimulation.. all these things can trigger the onset of contractions and labor.|`|Yl79igD7aa	Two words: nipple stimulation!  :)  Good luck.|`|eDmdkUO3aa	Let the baby come when s/he is ready.
Ccq8zEcnaa	It is different for everyone, not everyone has to have all the pregnancy symptoms, or have them all alike. Morning sickness is described different for each woman. Some women explain it as nausea and feeling like you could throw up any minute, some women explain it as throwing your guts up and can't hold nothing down. And then there are some cases when you just don't feel like eating, and food turns you off and you feel nausea. It depends, it is different for every woman. But if you get morning sickness, you will definitely know it when you get it. It usually starts around 5-7 weeks until you reach your second trimester.|`|utfoP7GWaa	My areolas didn't start changing until about 8-10 weeks. I hardly had any morning sickness, so I can't really help you on that. (I had 2 days of nuasea around 6 weeks.....that's it!)|`|uuHPneEcaa	morning sickness will start when ever it wants too there is no time frame on that. lol.. (get ready for it..)<br>  <br>  as far as aereolas it differs in every woman.. Its okay ur fine. u have nothing to worry about.. (just wait until u start lactating.|`|VhH9RJrSaa	not every one has morning sickness. you may not get it so dont count on it and dont worry if you dont. yes your breasts should be tender and once again the darkening of the aereolas depends on everyone. your gonna do fine god luck!<br>  <br>  HINT: the reason most women do have morning sickness is due to their pre-natels.<br>  at the begining of my pregnancy my gyn told me a secret.<br>  she said to take my prenatels after i eat and before i go to bed.<br>  the one time i took them in the morning before i ate i did puke up my banana and it was very unpleasent.|`|PfIywLLyaa	My Areolas did not really darken much at all, and they did not change until I was around 5-6 months. I just had tenderness and my breasts got larger. Also, I never really had morning sickness either. I was a little worried because the only real symptoms I had was bloating, weight gain, cramps and breast tenderness, but all is fine and I am expecting a little girl in April!|`|dsf5hGGnaa	That's how I was, everyone's pregnancy is different.  The morning sickness could start any day now hopefully you will be a lucky one and won't get it.  Congrats and good luck!<br>  <br>  I am about 15 weeks and my areola's aren't darker yet so don't be worried.|`|sqaey2Siaa	Your only 4 weeks. You have a while to go for the sickness and darkening of the aerolas etc. Every pregnancy is diffrent so no one can truely tell you when to expect any of this. You still have a LONG ways to go - try not to worry so much and just enjoy.|`|I6vMxEU9aa	That early on, my breasts were tender too, but everyone is different. Don't worry if you don't seem to be following every pregnancy symptom exactly when the book tells you you should be. Same with morning sickness. Some women have it throughout the pregnancy. Others don't have it at all. And it isn't always just in the morning. Typically though, you start noticing the nausea early in your first trimester, and it ends by the end of the first trimester. But, of course, everyone is different.<br>  <br>  Congratulations, and good luck!|`|B6cOlFU9aa	They will get darker with time, dont worry. Everyone's pregnancy is different. And I have morning sickness really bad right now, I have had it since I was two weeks pregnant, I'm now almost 7 months. I think mine has lasted much longer than normal, but my stomach is very sensitive. Morning sickness usually starts anywhere from two weeks to a month and lasts throughout the first trimester and sometimes into the second. If you have a sensitive stomach and get nauseous easily, I would recommend drinking tea and getting up an hour early every day and sitting up in bed and nibbling on crackers before you try to get up. This really helped me|`|otFCWMuUaa	completely normal.. some women wont have any symptom for a few months except morning sickness can start as early as 6 weeks.. but it all depends on u.. some people get it some people dont and then others get it worse.<br>  <br>  i had morning sickness 24/7 up until about 20-21 weeks  n then i have had occasional nautiousness throughout the rest of the pregnancy so far.. not fun. i lost 10lbs in the begining of the pregnancy but i quickly made up for it lol|`|OBU1eDUHaa	My nipple area got gradually darker and bigger throughout the pregnancy, not all at once.  Morning sickness is different for everyone.  I had it the minute I missed my period, my cousin didn't have it at all.  I was sick from morning to night with both my son and daughter, my friend was only sick in the early afternoon.  Good luck!|`|BMrnl372aa	my areolas never got darker and i breastfed both my babies so i wouldnt worry about that.  every preg and woman is different. and some women get morning sickness and others dont. i started getting morning sickness before i even knew i was preg with my daughter and with my son i never got morning sickness|`|0YdWJVyAaa	for me my aereolas never got darker, not even after i gave birth although i used to breast feed, its just that every body is different from the other . and i never suffered from morning sickness as well , so you might just be one of those lucky ones who never feel it as well|`|8LBl7HgAaa	Im 6 weeks pregnant and my boobs hurt so much! I dont have any sickness at all. here and there but hardly anything. My areolas are not dark. I think that starts until ur second trimester. You are lucky if you dont get any sickness! so be happy!<br>  I heard morning sickness is horrible and you lose weight from throwing up so much so be glad! Congrats sweetie!|`|d0Fmrywiaa	Congratulations!  Things are different for everyone, I never noticed my aereolas darkening, and I've had 2 healthy daughters.  Breats tenderness is a good sign though.  Like everything else, morning sickness may or may not happen, you just can't predict the start point, duration or severity.  Usually it starts between 5 and 6 weeks and ends at about 12-14 weeks.

With my first daughter I was in labor for 23 hours, with my second 6 hours, and with my third, my son I was in labor 28 hours.  He was the worst labor and delivery of all.  His head got stuck.  They tried a vaccuum extraction but he did not budge so they had to give me an episiotomy and pull him out with forceps.  For your sake I hope this one is atleast as easy if not easier than the others, but it is not always the case.|`|xZKqEp06aa	how was the sex to get the child
SBjV8GlFaa	I don't think that a book can help you raise your son, if there is a book on it, it's probably a funny type of book to make you laugh! I have two sons, and they are very different, but all kids are. I think if you just appreciate his personality, it will come natural to you, how to react to things while he is growing up! The main thing to remember, he is your son, so teach him good values, manners, how to treat girls, and later on ladies, and listen to him when he wants to talk to you!|`|fe37gfRvaa	The Art of Loving, by Erich Fromm (is the greatest book i've seen).<br>  it teaches you that you, as a mother can fall into a narcisistic love for your children, thus making them a part of you instead of give them confidence in themselves and releasing them (by overprotecting them and making them a 'part of you'). it also teaches you that the most important gift you can give to your son is to let him see you happy. you've to to learn to respect yourself, take care of yourself, and reply when he asks you things, so basically he sees that you love life. this is basically everything a boy needs from his mother.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	There is a PBS series on it, and a book by that title "Raising Boys" - both are very good and helpful.

Could this be a factor?|`|URbMCRFLaa	Go to a dollar store and buy a cheap pregnancy test. Buy a few actually to keep in your medicine cabinet. They've worked for me to confirm three pregnancies (although sadly, two miscarriages). Since you have been irregular in the past, you'll need a preg test to know for sure if you are pregnant or if your period is messed up again. Good luck!|`|2jtjVnThaa	If you are not having enough iron your body will try and keep the blood you have - resulting in an irregular period. On average a woman should eat about 14.7mg of iron per day. Try eating more spinach, soya flour, red meat or eggs.|`|62pCvaXGaa	Take a test. But periods are random for me ^^
AA12228565	I didn't loose twins but I also had a D&C in January.  I started my period on the 11 of Feb and hopefully we conceived a child this month.  I noticed when I ovulated I had really bad pains.  Didn't have that before the D&C.  I think you might be pregnant.  I don't think a smear tests and swabs would make your body produce ewcm.  But as you probably know when your pregnant you have more.  I had a tranvaganal done at 7 weeks and all they could see was a yoke sack.  I think it would be WAY to early to see anything.  Good Luck to you!!!!|`|91jTS7Epaa	Yes, the EWCM is a good sign.  (Check out www.fertilityfriend.com and take their online course - fantastic information!)  I don't know about the swabs and such, but am 99% sure that they would cause you to have EWCM.  Have you tried using an ovulation predictor kit?  You pee on a stick during certain days of your cycle and it tells you when you're most fertile?  Although my bet is with you bd'ing so much, it's a good chance.<br>  <br>  Other thing, the scan in two weeks would likely be too early to see the baby growing, but a home pregnancy test would likely be very accurate around that same time.  Make sure to tell the dr. about all of your symptoms, as they may not be okay with still doing the scan at that time, but will most likely be able to go ahead with it.

NaJPIOheaa	hey dear... i've been taking fertilitea along with agnus castus and evening primrose oil.. probably for about 3 months now, and my periods and ovulation have been regulated, and i'm actually getting fertile CM. fertilitea is great because it says on the bag its a 30 day supply and i'm still on the same bag 3 months later!! good luck xo|`|893kI3YNaa	Wow, I just started taking fertility blend on the 23 of February. Now maybe TMI. but my last period was on 2/14 it left on 2/18 now I'm on again it came monday. I called and they said it was normal so I am waiting to see also my man is taking the fertility blend for men also. So I AM PRAYING FOR  A MIRACLE ALSO!!!
IRFbj0G9aa	Can't say I have had this problem.  I just looked it up don't know if this will help at all, or if you have already read it.  Good Luck!  I am curious are you due for an ultrasound soon?  And you say two different doctors, I am assuming ob/gyns?  Well like the site basically says, it is not uncommon, make adjustments to your diet, hydrate and if you notice other symptoms which it states then take it way more seriously.<br>  Once again good luck, hope the site is helpful.|`|1JbdCRdtaa	sometimes this can be a sign of impending labor but like your doctor said it could also be a stomach bug. Did they check your dilation and effacement? I think that would be a better sign of when you are most likely going to go into labor. Hope the baby holds on 3 more weeks!!!<br>  <br>  Hayley
oAyOEkQYaa	I have 5 kids.<br>  <br>  17 daughter<br>  Twins one girl one boy aged 16<br>  14 daughter<br>  6 daughter<br>  <br>  We make sure that the kids know their own chores, each of the 4 older children are completely responsible for their bedrooms, they keep  them tidy, make beds etc.  Every night after dinner they each take it in turn to load the dish washer. The 6 year old helps set the table, at the weekend they each have a room which they help to clean.  The youngest especially likes dusting and polishing.<br>  <br>  I feel this instills responsibility in children, if they don't put away their own toys, DVDs. Clothes etc then they know they will go straight to the charity shop, that definitely helps to keep the house clean.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I have 3 kids, and recently went back to work full time after being a stay at home mom for about a year, so we are still perfecting our daily routine, but here's how it is so far:<br>  <br>  6am - Hubby and I get up and shower.<br>  630am - We get the kids up so they can get ready for school<br>  715am - Everybody leaves for work/school.  Hubby drops kids off at school on his way.<br>  5pm - I get off work and go pick up all the kids.  Then the evening varies, based on what is happening.  Mondays is Scouts, Friday is bowling, and next week soccer starts.<br>  615pm - I get home from work and drop off with hubby whichever kid doesn't need to go somewhere.  If no one has to go anywhere, I start dinner, laundry, dishes, etc.<br>  7pm - Dinner & clean up<br>  8pm - One kid takes a shower, the other 2 in the morning, the kids go to bed.<br>  Hubby and I usually go to bed by 10 or 11.<br>  <br>  I am looking forward to the weekend!

Congrats on a big family.  I agree with the answerers who have said dish out chores to the older ones (a bit of pocket money may bribe them!)  I have 3 kids so no where near the amount of work you have to do but I think prioritising the jobs that need to be done is essential, my house is clean but rarely tidy, your kids will never thank you for having a clean, tidy house, but feeling loved, being well fed, and having fun is what they will remember of their childhood.|`|CegTlp4Caa	Deal with it.

It's a free home organisation site that helps you get into routines that suit you, your home and family. There's busy friendly forums and lots of encouragement to help you on your way and everything is broken down into babysteps to help you pick up good habits. It's a great site and has helped me so much in keeping up with a routine that means things are less stressful for me in my home. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|e00fc1c299d34a3d8c47805b7ceab0a4aa	Anyone over 10 can help with housework - stacking plates for washing up, taking clothes upstairs and putting their own stuff away. The older ones can do things live vacuuming and washing up and washing. So can your husband. Work and school do not preclude you from helping out. Bigger kids can bathe the middle ones whilst you put the baby to bed etc. Make a rota. Have a motto - 'You dont work, you dont eat'. They will gladly do chores!
VKQzj4Pmaa	I am sorry, but there really is not much you can do. The only thing you can do is talk to him directly about these issues. Don't yell and don't fight. That will only make him feel defensive and you won't get anywhere with him. Try to stay calm yet show him you are serious, and try to make your concerns simple and to the point. If he doesn't say much, ask him for feedback and for his thoughts.<br>  <br>  If things do not change, go to court and bring these issues before a judge. Tell the judge exactly what is going on, and ask that he have less visitation or at least supervised visits. I know you want their father in their lives, but don't do it at the expense of ruining the family you have with your daughters.|`|prqrQcd1aa	You need to call him up and ask him these things and actually talk to him in a civil way about all of this. If that doesn't work then maybe mention to him that if the behavior of the kids doesn't change you are going to go for a court modification stating that the kids are acting like this and request supervised visits until a home study can be done where he lives!|`|AA11540246	Sue him for child support

PYIA2FCFaa	how long has this been going on? im thinking that this is just a stage for her. But, if this has been going on now for a couple months then maybe a trip to the doctor wouldn't hurt. i don't think your looking too deep. being a mother myself to a five year old...we tend to have intuitions about certain things. don't be ashamed to talk to her pediatrician about this. Its for her best interest and will help you feel at ease. <br>  <br>  bon.|`|40WPuaMpaa	I am in the same situation as you, my 4 year old acts out all the time. We are struggling to deal with it. For her it started when our second child was born 6 months ago. I think it is an attention issue. Also at preschool the teachers said she always plays by herself and not with the other kids. I find it strange because I do daycare and she plays with kids all the time. We have been encouraging her to play more at school, and the teachers have said it is working, but slowly. As for the acting up... we have tried a lot of things, time out, spankings, talking to her about it, a reward system... my best resource had been books. Especially the Nanny 911 book as well as the Supernanny book by Jo Frost. They have some really good techniques in them. Good luck!|`|ywI7XxH4aa	Hi<br>  My daughter is much younger than your so i cannot help much but i will say you're not looking into it too mcuh. Your daughter is basically withdrawing herself from people which is not good.  I think she is having tantrums because she is frustrated about something. YOu need to find out what it is.  You could try talking to her about it in a safe environment or you could do that strategy where you draw pictures together and see if her picture give you an indication of what's wrong by asking her about them.<br>  Good luck|`|zeL5DJG3aa	i have a 4 year old too.  his tantrums have gotten worse as well.  at 4 years old, they can communicate and i've been trying to talk to him about his tantrums and teaching him to use his words to tell us how he feels.  also when he loses a privilege for misbehaving, he screams and cries like i've chopped off his big toe - i get on his level and tell him that i understand he is upset and i understand he is mad BUT he made the choices that led to this consequence.  i think it's really helped that i talk to him and let him know that i do understand how he feels.  i used to ignore the fits when he was younger but i think at this age, it's important to start acknowledgeing his feelings and talking about them.
sHzP9u5Taa	i think its completely normal....most girls want to be a mum one day and its not wrong at all to get excited about it, especially when you're around babies anyway<br>  <br>  im 18 and i work around children a lot and i like to day dream about when i have kids, who with and what they'll look like blah blah<br>  <br>  its just part of being female lol<br>  <br>  xxx|`|1ikl5q97aa	getting broody means wanting to have babies for those of you who don't know .<br>  <br>  It could be wrong if your are unable to support the child you are wanting to have but if you have planned it out and figured out your money situation and realized how much this is going to cost then no its not wrong .|`|ZAqTOjs6aa	Wrong? Absolutely not. But there is a difference between that and responsibility. Responsibility would be not letting another child grow up knowing he or she wasn't wanted at the time. <br>  <br>  Simply wanting is ok. Getting is not ok.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	im outta the loop...wth does 'get broody' mean?|`|PB13IVHhaa	im the same..orrible aint it|`|iojRLiBGaa	Usually i'd suggest it was wrong because you're still young.<br>  Yet, you two seem very happy. <br>  Once you've moved in with him, give it a month or two. See how you live together and make sure you're able to manage the bills etc. <br>  Then, maybe you could think of starting a family?<br>  Yes, you are young, but sometimes people start early and i reckon you might be one of these exceptions.<br>  It isn't wrong at all, you're just ready.|`|Cy9MmTzCaa	It's definitely not wrong at all. I'm the same way exactly. I'm 18. My boyfriend and I are moving in together in three months (as soon as I graduate). We're engaged.<br>  <br>  But anyways, Seeing and wanting babies is just fine. Just before you end up having babies make sure you're able to support them. I mean that in any possible way it can be taken. Emotionally you may or may not be ready fro a child. I don't know you specifically, so I wouldn't know that. Some people will say you're too young to handle a child I disagree. People back a long time ago used to start having babies a lot younger than commonly happens now-a-days, adn those kids grew up just fine. It's more than that though. It's about being able to handle it financially too. Babies cost a lot of money (that's why my fiancee and I have to wait. We both know that if i got pregnant right now we wouldn't be able to give that child what it deserved)<br>  <br>  But anyways, its perfectly normal to want a baby.
KEu8nqEQaa	My husband and I both took Fertilaid (from earlypregnancytests.com) for three months. We just got our BFP on 2/21. I can't say for sure if it was the vitmains that helped, but we had been trying for 6 months before taking it with no luck. Its worth a try. If nothing else, start taking regular pre natal vitamins that you can get at your local store. *Baby Dust*|`|MmQi03oXaa	I can't talk about the others, but I did Vitex and it worked.<br>  <br>  I went off of my bc Aug 07 and didn't have a period at all. I started Vitex in Nov 07, got my period that month, ovulated early Dec 07 and conceived. Unfortunately, that ended in miscarriage. However, it did work.<br>  <br>  I was taking two pills of Vitex each day. Good luck!
BZjkpBB8aa	Hi there!  My daughter eats (I think) fairly well, or a lot anyway lol!  Here is what a general day is like for us:<br>  Breakfast: toast fingers with cheese whiz or jam, cheerios dry, yogurt (feeds herself), and a bit of egg (hard boiled cut into slices), sometimes I make french toast and hash browns and water <br>  Snack: gerber puffs (star shaped wheat apple/strawberry flavour), shredded cheese, apple slices/kiwi cut up/raspberries and water<br>  Lunch: homemade chicken/turkey pot pies OR grilled cheese fingers w/out crust OR chunky soups OR fish sticks OR beefaroni etc and peas/corn or broccoli along with a bit of juice (usually melon/strawberry) Then she nurses<br>  Snack: rest of her fruit or some pudding and water and a baby rice cracker<br>  Supper: anything we eat usually : lasagna, spaghetti, chicken, fish, stew, a veggie or two, garlic toast (occasional), meatloaf etc...she loves macaroni and cheese (homemade)!<br>  Snack: melon slices or apple or any fruit imagineable and some shredded cheese Then nurses again<br>  <br>  All of these are general ideas that we do each week, the key is to get their nutrients etc. on a weekly basis. :)<br>  I hope that this helps!!!!|`|ibeYAlwpaa	cheese, cheerios, kix, eggs (hard boiled makes a great snack!)pancakes, toast,  peanut butter & jelly sanwiches (i use reduced suger peanut butter) salt free pretzels fruit (oranges Grapefruit, my little ones not to found of apples, bananas ect.) Veggies ( pretty much all of them) Grilled cheese, mac and cheese ( i use ones for toddlers not the boxed brand) Veggie corn dogs,  pretty much what i eat minus the suger, salt spices content!!!<br>  <br>  also my little girl LOVES cheese, she'd eat it alllll day if id let her|`|b99kfMPcaa	My son is a very picky eater.  For breakfast he usually eats a whole banana.  Sometimes I will give him a blueberry waffle (the frozen kind) without syrup.  He has a snack about ten o'clock, which is usually a cheese stick (like string cheese or cheddar).  For lunch he eats mac n' cheese, or those little vienna sausages.  Snack in the afternoon is usually yogurt.  For dinner he eats what we eat, just chopped up into little bite size peices.  He doesn't always eat it, but I make him try.  I had the same feelings as you, that my son wasn't eating properly, so I went out and bought some PediCare drinks.  They balance out their nutrition, and my son guzzled them down like they were the best thing ever.<br>  <br>  At least your son likes nutritious foods.  I'll give you a list of the things my son likes to eat.  I try to mix and match them, and if he eats a variety of things, I don't worry so much about it.  Talk to his pediatrician about this and see what he/she says.  Giving him vitamins daily also helps with him absorbing nutrients.<br>  <br>  Protein:<br>  Eggs (scrambled)<br>  peanut butter <br>  beans (my son loves baked beans)<br>  vienna sausages<br>  <br>  Calcium:<br>  cheese <br>  milk<br>  yogurt<br>  sugar-free ice cream<br>  <br>  Fruits:<br>  banana<br>  sliced strawberry<br>  peaches (cut up)<br>  <br>  He also eats toast, cereal, and pasta.  These are just some of the things my son eats.  He doesn't like meat, except for the saussages.  He is also more of a snacker than a "meal" kind of guy.  So I make sure he gets plenty of things to snack on throughout the day.  Then before bed I give him a PediCare.  He seems to be growing and thriving just fine.  Remember, our kids have really small stomachs at this age, so they can't eat a lot at once, which makes it seem like they don't eat much at all.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  I forgot veggies!  duh!  He also eats green beans and peas.  So far those are the only two veggies I can get him to eat...|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	For each meal, we give our 17-month-old daughter a whole grain, two fruits, and two vegetables. Well, if it's a big fruit or vegetable (i.e., a small container of baby carrots, or a whole banana), then she will only have one. <br>  <br>  She only has one snack, since breakfast is usually between 9:30-10 and lunch is at one. Her afternoon snack is usually a fruit and a veggie<br>  <br>  Her baby food is either the organic brand from Giant Eagle grocery store or Earth's Best. Otherwise, she will eat adult food and if what we buy happens to be organic, then cool. <br>  <br>  Today for lunch I thought about giving her part of a Boca vegan veggie burger, but the only way I have to heat it up is to microwave it and I don't want her to have microwaved food yet. (I was leery of microwaves and plastic in microwaves long before the baby bottle stories came out.) She has had hummus and really likes it. I didn't think of that for lunch, especially since her baby food cabinet is almost empty and she already had her carrots and banana for breakfast. <br>  <br>  The cookbook "Viva Le Vegan!" by Dreena Burton gives excellent guidelines for feeding babies and toddlers. I read it the first time a few days after Christmas (my MIL, who is very far from being vegan gave it to me) and wished I had had it when my daughter was younger.<br>  <br>  After reading this, I'm reminded that I don't think my daughter gets enough protein, i.e., beans, veggie "meats", etc. She does occasionally get some organic sweet potatoes and chicken, though. (My husband is big on our daughter getting whole real foods and eating very well, but he is not vegan and still eats things I don't consider good anymore.) She's had baked beans, veggie crumbles, bits of my regular veggie burgers, bean chili, just not enough. Blech. We've also started to give her some O Soy yogurt. It's not vegan though. Meh.<br>  <br>  On very rare occasions she has had things like cookies, cake, soy ice cream, etc. She had my version of Wacky Cake (whole wheat flour, a dozen rounded tablespoons of cocoa, apple sauce for the oil and I use the chocolate frosting/glaze recipe on Veg Web, only I use chocolate soy milk if I have it instead of vanilla) and chocolate soy ice cream at her birthday party and at my grandfather's 100th birthday celelbration she had some cake (straight bakery cake; I even had some it was nice and velvety and not very sweet) and occasionally, she'll  have bits of Kashi cookies or Trader Joe's or Whole Foods fruit and grain bars.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	my daughter is 15 months on a typical day shell eat<br>  <br>  7am toast and a sippy of milk sometimes ill give her come cheerios to go along side ot or scrambled egg<br>  <br>  9am she has a snack of raisins and fruit<br>  <br>  12 noon she have lunch normally a sandwich whith some cheese and cucumber for her to munch on...sometimes shell have a yoghurt too<br>  <br>  3pm shell have some fruit to snack on. somedays shell have a cookie or puffs but only sometimes<br>  <br>  5pm shell have a pasta dish or rice dish with chickn or beef and veggies<br>  <br>  7pm shell have a sippy of milk if shes hungry i give her fruit<br>  then she goes to bed:)<br>  <br>  somedays my daughter will barely eat anything , on a normal day shell eat ok and some days i have no idea how she fits it on her little body lol if your sone os thriving happy alert gaining weight, dont be worried. they only eat what they need to live on:) maybe your son isnt a big eater:) goodluck if your worried though get him checked:)
AA11327039	If semen gets anywhere near your vagina then yes, you can get pregnant.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	If you are only a technical virgin, yes you can.  It's rare, but if you've been getting naked with your boyfriend, it could have happened.
kYkKcQJ2aa	Yes you can, expecially when you are in deep thought of thinking of your baby. I will never forget sitting on the couch with my husband and we just got back from the parenting classes at the hospital and all of a sudden my shirt was wet. Also they will leak when you orgasm. It is totally normal. Good Luck!|`|vcxdTXbraa	ohhhh yessss......you my dear are normal|`|kT7GVOosaa	Absolutely.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	Yes it is possible to leak from the beginning of the pregnancy.  I started to leak at 6 weeks as soon as I find out I was pregnant.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I would have to say yes because I have begun to leak at 18 weeks.  Sometimes I have to wear nursing pads to stay dry.|`|uEo0vS7aaa	Yes, once those pregnancy hormones kick in, you experience a lot of unfamiliar changes.|`|UEAzzroAaa	Yes, absolutely. Specially if this is your first.|`|PeEIuzP5aa	yes, i did with both of mine and dr. told me to relax that my body was getting ready. plus he also told me if you are having sex though the pregnancy it will leak to. but not worry.<br>  good luck.|`|SiIuJXvwaa	yea..... welcome to the pregnancy world congrats hun

Xngq54vBaa	Up to 16 months it's still "normal" for a little one not to be walking... it's not a sign of intelligence or later abilities, it's just that each child develops differently (my son didn't walk until 14 months and my daughter is 12 months and still not walking on her own).  A push toy is (doll stroller, push and ride, etc.) is a good start, then just hold out your arms to her when you're just inches out of reach and see if she'll transfer from holding onto it to you.  Be patient.<br>  <br>  However, if your niece is really "almost 2" and not walking on her own, I'd encourage her parent to talk to the pediatrician because she may need physical therapy or it could be a warning sign of other problems.|`|wxEqpMrEaa	Hold a cookie out over her head and just out of reach so that her attention is drawn not to the floor, and she has to come and get it.|`|BZjkpBB8aa	I look after a little girl that is the same way!  The one I watch doesn't even try walking along things or holding hands though. She didn't crawl or try to until she was over a year old! She has just started to TRY and stand on her own.  (She is 19 months old) It IS frustrating when this little person is talking and acting like a toddler but not up and active.  The girl I watch went to the doctor with her parents and was suggested swimming for muscle building as well as physio therapy to help strengthen those muscles too!  <br>  I try to motivate her with high fives when she does stand and encourage her to follow my daughter around the room while holding my hand.  I can get her take a couple of steps (very wobbly) on her own but she has to be prodded to even try :) (My daughter is just over a year and has been walking since 10 months.)  <br>  Encourage her and give her some praise when she does walk, ask her if she wants to be a big girl!!  Make it a positive experience for her and hopefully she will get more confidence.  Maybe someone in her life is being overprotective about something and she has a lack of confidence because of it.  Get her moving and suggest physio or at least the pool :)  Best of luck!!

I don't know what your usual reaction is to them lying, but sometimes I feel the need to tell a "white lie" because the consequence of telling the truth would be having someone yell at me or being insanely upset. Try out being as calm as possible and trying to get them to have an open discussion with you when they are not doing anything wrong about why they feel they have the tendency to lie. Sometimes reassuring them that if their fear is that they would get yelled at or punished, that you would make a point to listen to what they have done wrong and discuss it with them, they would be more prone to being able to open up honestly with you. But you also have to keep your bargain to not yell or whatever it is they fear. Also, give them examples of good figures who are respected for not lying and why it makes them good, respected people.

9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? If its going to make you feel awkward, then I say maybe a small gift. One suggestion would be to make a small gift basket, with stuff for 'mom' like lotion, body wash, a candle, something simple, non-expensive, because I'm sure she knows what all you have done, and appreciates it a lot, you don't really have to get her anything, but if you don't want to go empty handed, do a 'momma' bag or something, to pamper herself with.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Absolutely not. I think you've given her plenty! Of course, you can get her something but don't feel obligated to. <br>  <br>  You could always make something. I love scrapbooking picture frames and the supplies(including the frame) don't have to run over $10.|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	She still needs a baby shower after all that! j/k....<br>  <br>  Maybe just a nice card; i think you've already gone above and beyond, hope she appreciates what a great friend she has.|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	Yeah, I'd say just a card maybe w/ a gift certificate of $10-25 and like the other poster suggested wrap up a small gift like a picture frame or a little book of firsts.  Something small that she enjoys might be nice.  That way you don't feel akward at the party but, she knows you've already given so much for her and her baby.  You're a good friend!|`|oDGpmkMaaa	I would just give her a card. I mean you gave her the bluk of stuff that she will need. I gave my sister all my stuff and she still insists on having a shower. I'm not going to get her anything but a card. She understands that too.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	I think you have given her lots. Who needs a babyshower when she already has all the necessities.

That way your not wasting to much MORE money and you do not look stupid showing up empty handed. <br>  Plus how can you go wrong with diapers?|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	Oh man!  What a dilemma!  I completely understand how you feel.  You have been extremely generous with your friend.  Unfortunately, I think the "proper" thing to do is to show up with something.  I know, I know....but it doesn't have to be anything expensive.  Why not just get her a nice card and some onsies, or a really pretty receiving blanket or something.  <br>  <br>  I really do see what you mean though.  Good luck.  I would feel like a real butt if I showed up empty handed too.|`|cix2DEbbaa	she knows how uch you`ve done for her, just get a nice card & maybe a pack of plain onsies or something, nothing expensive, they`re sets of 3 white one, etc at walmart for like $10. <br>  I wouldn`t suggest spending over $15 seriously.<br>  I mean you gave her A LOT of stuff|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Only because she's a close friend do I say yes.  It doesn't have to be anything much, as I'm sure she's incredibly grateful for what she's already received.|`|6QZzoSVFaa	Just to be nice, I recommend buying a gift. Something fairly simple perhaps one more baby outfit or a baby bottle. Just something that doesn't cost to much. <br>  Its so you don't fell awkward when you walk in. Even something such as a card will do. If you feel you need to you can add five or ten dollars with the card...  Again just something that wouldn't cost too much because you have already given her many things.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps !|`|ClVWYizbaa	I would at least get her some diapers and wipes.  And get her a card and write a little note in there saying that if she needs any advice or has any questions about being a mommy (no matter how stupid they may sound to her) to just pick up the phone and call you, no matter the time of night.  All new mothers need someone to answer all their questions, no matter how stupid or silly they are.  And don't forget to mention  in the card how lucky her child is to have such a great mommy like her!  This will really make her feel special.  Hope this helps!|`|tk2AOZU5aa	Really, you do not have to. Just going to the shower is enough. If it gets brought up, or if someone asks you, "What did you give?" Let them know that you gave her tons of stuff. Celebrating the birth, being with friends, and being a close friend to offer advice, hand me downs that are practically brand new, and help after the little one arrives is plenty. I am sure your friend does not expect any more. If you are still struggling, ask her if she still expects a present. Tell her you will make her a meal after she gets home from the hospital.
mDYsr62maa	Get another doctor.  Any child on that much medication and where you have not been told exactly what the medication does, what the side affects are, and what the interactions are, has been seeing a pill pushing quack.  Get a new doctor immediately and take the records from the old doctor to the new doctor.  Do not take no for an answer.  Stand in the lobby and demand your records.  There may be a small fee, but under US law, they are your records.  Be loud, doctors do not like their errors made public and especially not to their waiting patients.  Learn what is being prescribed and why.  There may be a reason for such a strong set of drugs, but it would be a rare thing.  And stopping some medications cold turkey can be dangerous and even deadly.
LrxTy3zLaa	Congratulations, Rei!! I'm thrilled for all four of you. :)<br>  <br>  I raised all 3 of mine very close together (about 18 months) & my daughter is raising hers fairly close (the first 2 are two years apart while the third is 4 years after the second).<br>  It can be done & it's not really that hard.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it's easier to have them close together so there's less rivalry & more bonding... there will always be fights but they tend to get past it quicker.<br>  <br>  The best way to deal with Noel is to let her in on everything (as close to "everything" as you can without getting carried away. :S)<br>  This means calling the new baby "our" baby instead of saying "my" baby, telling her what the doctor says about "our" new baby & getting her excited about the new arrival. She can help pick colors for clothes & help choose toys.<br>  <br>  I know that she's just a year old & she doesn't quite understand yet but as you progress in your pregnancy she will understand more & she will feel the need to be included in all of the baby plans.<br>  <br>  You will need to stop carrying Noel. That's not good for you or the newest member of your family.<br>  Tell her she's a big girl & can hold mommy's hand... & have your husband do the carrying when crossing streets & parking lots.<br>  <br>  In order to get her to overcome the separation anxiety you'll need to do it, literally, in Baby Steps.<br>  Go into the kitchen while she's in the living room, stay gone a minute or two (even if she cries) & come back so that she understands that mommy always comes back when she leaves. Gradually work your way up to leaving her with your husband or a babysitter while you walk outside for 10 minutes or so... later, take short trips to the store (& don't forget the "good girl treat").<br>  <br>  It takes time with the first one... for both of you... but it can be done.<br>  <br>  BTW... we've been missing you at DiMeraDays... but I see you have a good excuse for your absence. ;)|`|hKJIDdVqaa	trust me, she will get over it.  she has no choice really.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Just always talk with her about it all the time that you will be having a new baby, try to bring children around a little more.|`|N6cuuDAmaa	Well give her a little while to adjust... but I know this family that had their kids pretty close together and they don't have any problems, I babysit them sometimes and they're really great kids... they're kids are like 9,6,3,1,and 6 months old... so don't worry that much... just get her used to the idea of having a little brother or sister and she should be fine!|`|JsqMSU9Haa	not all kids are jealous of siblings.  involve her as best you can - instead of saying the baby, say your sister/brother.  you might be surprised how she handles it.  she'll also be older and more independent.  start doing more playdates/playgroups with her now so she gets used to other kids.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	She WILL adjust well. You just have to let her know now that she will have a little baby brother or sister. Get her a big sister shirt. By the time the baby comes she should understand.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	time to teach little noel how to be independant a litlte better, my kids are 16 months apart and my son was never jealous, he was to young to be. My kids are the best of friends and protectors of each other<br>  <br>  I found it easier having them close together, i potty trained them together, they are learning how to ride their bikes togethre but they can still play without each other as well<br>  <br>  you can do it, deep breaths =)|`|d5479b73829d5fa0818d9eec2850a058aa	You'll be fine.  By my 'rough' calculations Noel will be around 20 months when the new baby comes so she wont be a little baby but a fairly adventurous toddler.  I know your worried about neglecting Noel but at the same time you will have to spend time with the new baby.  I got around this by buying a baby sling so that the new baby could lie against my body whilst I sat and played with my 14 month old.  There's many things you can do with a toddler that will help the 'bond' whilst having the new baby in a sling, eg, playing in a sand pit, pushing her on a swing, going for a walk in the buggy, drawing, painting, playing with dough, etc, etc, etc.<br>  Right now your probably still in shock, and that's normal, I was in shock right up until I had my new baby in my arms and it wasn't until I got home and the two of them got together that I realised we'd be ok.  With only 14 months between mine they're very close, despite being sister and brother, they really are best friends.<br>  <br>  Good luck honey, you'll be fine.|`|haabfMtkaa	You will be O.K. I remember feeling that same way.Is your daughter ready for pre school? Or maybe a slash preschool day care. I would start something like that before your new one arrives so she does not feel like she is being shipped out cause there's a new baby in the house. If you can find a really good place your daughter will really enjoy it and she will make new friends and get used to you drooping her off and KNOW that you will be there with a hug and a smile when its time. Also this will give you some alone time with the new baby and even perhaps a nap! Play dates are good as well. I know we try but when you have multiple children we need help. This is what worked for me. My daughter started going to a pre school day care I really like and was recommended to me through friends. it is Only 4 hours a day but it allows me to get some stuff done while the baby is asleep and some one on one time with the baby. Also my older daughter gets home from "school" at 12:30 and the baby is down for her nap so we also get some time to talk about her day and such. She has made some really great friends and I see her progressing daily. I hope this helps and good luck it is not gonna be as hard as you think.
Fh4B88ZGaa	Your doctor should be monitoring your ovulation closely so that they can time your IUI correctly. If you ovulate early and miss your IUI window, you're going to have to wait until next month. There is no shot that can be given that will force you to ovulate in the middle of a cycle when you have already ovulated- if there was, they wouldn't make you take Clomid.|`|AA11116434	Clomid can give you a false positive OPK, especially if taken the same day, or the day after your last clomid pill. However, I was charting also and I did have a cycle where I ovulated day 12 when I usually ovulate like clockwork on CD 14 or 15. If you think you've already ovulated they can check with a sonogram to see the size of your follicles. I still did the IUI that time and it was a waste of money since I had in fact ov'd on day 12.

Fy9S6hjIaa	Ok, here's a step by step.  It should all fit into a 9oz bottle with liners.  <br>  <br>  In a 12-16oz glass measuring cup, add 8oz (or 1 cup) of water.<br>  <br>  Next, add 4 scoops of powdered formula.  Make sure it is *not* packed!<br>  <br>  Mix well with a small spoon.<br>  <br>  Tap sides fo the cup until all air bubbles rise to the surface and disappear.<br>  <br>  Slowly pour the formula into the lined bottle trying not to make any more air bubbles. <br>  <br>  Done!<br>  <br>  If it still doesn't seem to be fitting into the bottle, then you probably only have and 8oz bottle and just reduce the amount of water to 7oz and the amount of formula to 3 1/2 loose scoops.  Never just put the water and powder in the bottle and shake unless you absolutely have to (like when you're out).  It puts lots of air in the formula which makes for a gassy baby|`|sqaey2Siaa	It tells you exactly on the back of the container..or just use common sense..every formula is diffrent. The back of the container however will tell you what a scoop should make. Put your water in the bottle add the scoops shake and serve. <br>  <br>  Example: <br>  2 scoops = 4 oz<br>  4 scoops = 8 oz.<br>  <br>  So if your trying to make a 9 oz...put 4 1/2 scoops. etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT*** Okay..if your using liners..its way easier to pre mix..in a jug or s/thing and then take it out of the fridge as you need it and warm it if you usually warm your babys bottle. Its really hard to shake up formula in the bottle liner without a huge mess.|`|1hciyvKdaa	the most important factor is exact measurment, if you over fill water, you mise well just give it water, you must mix perfectly. I read an entire story done on a medical journal on mal nutrition in third world nations, wow, its amazing, how many babies are growing up with mom caused issues and defiencies, its very sad.<br>  Go get a pyrex or such measuring cup with all the lines on it for all types of measuring and do it the right way. Good luck with the new baby!!!!!|`|TqOdbhNAaa	It's usually one scoop to 2 ounces of water.  What kind of formula are you using?  I know for sure that Similac is one scoop to 2 ounces.|`|9cQaltGXaa	The correct is to fill your bottle with the correct amount of water (240ml+8oz) then add in the formula ( 4 scoops). It looks as though it will overflow but once the powder is incorporated its fine. Shake well to ensure all powder is diluted.<br>  By adding 4 scoops to 10oz, your diluting the formula not giving the appropriate amount of nutrients ( we were told this by our pediatrician)<br>  And by adding the water to the 4 scoops of powder you are making it too concentrated.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|7K6vpsdhaa	I use Cow and Gate formula which is 1 scoop to 1 oz of water, so to make up an 8 oz bottle I put in 8 oz of water. I heat up the water so that the powder disolves quicker and then give it a good shake. It might look like it will overflow but let the powder disolve a little.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	I used to use the 10 oz bottles to make 8 oz's of formula so it would all fit in.  The 8 oz bottles don't seem to leave enough room for the formula to fit in.  You could try mixing it in a different container and then filling up the bottle.|`|aGxbD6snaa	fill the bottle up to the 8oz mark then put 8 scoops in (if the formula you are using is 1 scoop to 1oz). it should fit without overflowing even if it goes above the marks because when you add the powder it will make it rise.|`|955YoHvVaa	Usually its 1 scoop per 2 oz of water..so if you make an 8 oz bottle..4 scoops.|`|pXSKSS3daa	"What do you do?"<br>  <br>  I follow the instructions on the can. It's one scoop per every two oz. of water. Your sister should be using 5 scoops for a 10 oz. bottle and your friend is doing it correctly.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Put in 8 ounces of water, and then add 4 scoops.  It will be more then 8 ounces.  Your sister does it wrong!  That is too much water, and your friend doesn't have enough water.<br>  <br>  You already have the 8 ounces of water, you are then adding more substance, of course your not going to still have 8oz.  LOL!
H0fXySX9aa	my friend was told at 6 weeks 3 days there were two sacs and 2 heart beats|`|eU5Eth2aaa	My sister found out at her first ultrasound.  I think she was somewhere between 6 and 8 weeks along.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|7AtxrHQnaa	I had an ultrasound at 6 weeks & it was twins.  It depends on how early they do an ultrasound.  If your dr. thinks you show signs of twins he'll probably do an ultasound.  Thats really the best way to know for sure.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I would think both would show up now if you had an ultrasound at your appointment.  I have heard of one baby being hid and not showing up until later though.  Talk to your doctor about it so they can monitor your hcg levels as well.|`|PpYBnxgpaa	I go back to the doctor at 9 weeks to do a US because I was measuring 11 weeks at only 7  . They said the will be able to see to heart beats by then . <br>  <br>  Hope I helped  . And congrats on your pregnancy|`|MsipL0Mzaa	tell them at your appt,they will probaly do a scan to be sure...if there were twins,it would most likely show up,as 2 sacs or embryos..... plus your hcg levels will be higher
wiAVa1H5aa	Have you treated their clothes and bedding?   That is, more and more lice killing products don't do all the job and you need to take their bedding and clothes, place them in plastic sacks and force all the air out and leave them for a month to kill the lice.   Nit picking is also important, systematically groom her hair and kill the nits that you find.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	You have to treat their toys, bedding stuff, cloths, and furniture where they have sat. Also perhaps your child goes to school with someone whom has lice but their parent does not know. I would let the school know and they will check the kids. <br>  TyffTaff|`|eMSv7RwYaa	tea tree shampoo is really good because lice apparently hate it. A lot of those head lice shampoos and other treatments don't kill all of them so they just come back again. I remember when i was young i had lice for ages as no treatment got rid of them,then my mum got some tea tree shampoo and they seemed to just go away.|`|hUbNKOTsaa	wash all hats and and head coversings, clothes, and sheets especially pillow case. wash anything they put on their head over and over without it being washed in between the lice could come off and when they put it back on it gets back on their head. take them to the doctor maybe they can get some stronger stuff for you|`|PTdy6TWRaa	Make sure all bedding and clothing is washed. Check frequently for nits and comb them out. Use oils in the hair to discourage lice, or Tea Tree oil to repel them. If you want to go hardcore on killing them then use Vaseline in the hair but be prepared for a heck of a job trying to wash it all out.|`|hZf8aJkYaa	rid doesnt work <br>  get your dr to write you a prescription its a little pricey but ti works<br>  <br>  treat everything|`|TK03jZTuaa	All you can do is go through her hair and indivudually pick out each egg and make sure there are none left in her hair. It's a slow way but the only way to be certain they are all gone.<br>  <br>  If you use the chemical treatments too often head lice can become immune to them.<br>  <br>  also change sheets and make sure her friends that come to play don't bring them into the house.|`|hrVbxk8Jaa	Omg my step daughter keeps getting them too. I found the only thing that works.<br>  <br>  At first it takes some time but I swear it WORKS.<br>  <br>  Go to the store and buy: listeren(yellow/brown)only. Then get vinegar. Also get a really good conditioner,and shower caps and the metal lice combs. One more thing tea tree oil. <br>   Come home and pour the mouth wash all over her head. Put the shower cap on for one hour if the lice isn't that bad if it is than leave it on overnight. Rinse and then pour the vinegar on and put the shower cap back on. Wait one hour. Then comb her hair with the lice comb. Over and over again the mouth wash kills any lice. The vinegar makes the glue on the eggs easy to get off. Next. Wash all bedding and clothes in HOT HOT water. The next morning use the conditioner put it on dry hair and comb comb comb. Then put 1 teaspoon of tea tree oil in 32oz of bottle of shampoo. A shampoo with coconut oil is best but any will do. Shake the shampoo every time u use it but then wash her hair with the shampoo and then any conditioner. After you've done this all the lice should be gone and eggs. If not just repeat. I go through this every time I get my step daughter from her mother. It sucks I know. She gets them every time I send her back home. <br>   After you are lice free u can spray the mouth wash on her hair once a week after a bath with wet hair. The lice don't like the taste of it and should never infest her head again. My daughter never gets it from her step sister cause I spray her hair 1 time a week,and wash her hair with the tea tree oil shampoo every time I wash her hair if you need more help. Let me know aries1283@yahoo.com good luck I'm here if u need help. I know it sucks. I'm a mom of 3 girls.|`|kZqsWsv3aa	well how long is her hair? i use to have them and all i did was get a hair cut, besides doing her bedding and pillows or any toys she might have that they can hide it, cutting her hair will help a lot! i got mine cut and they dissapeared!

Last time you were Lucy G and you included a picture of your "miscarriage" Sick..find something else to do with your time besides hurting pregnant women.<br>  <br>  If you were simply asking a true questions, you wouldn't have multiple accounts with differnt user names.

vue9NOhYaa	You just stop taking it. YOu will get  your usual withdrawal bleed at the end of the pack, and then you will probably ovulate again and start having periods within a month or two. <br>  <br>  Your periods may be a bit  irregular for a while when you first stop, but, if you were regular before you started taking it, you should return to your normal pattern within a few months.  (If you were irregular before, you will continue to be irregular as your body returns to YOUR normal patterns.)|`|gwuTKiNXaa	it;s going to be irregular after going off the hormones but all you do is stop taking the pill|`|9osFXKPyaa	i stop taking mine february first i had spotting for 5 days then had a period for 6 days so i had a total of a 11 day period Im now waiting to see when it's going to come back again. but if you stop the pills in the middle of the pack you will regret it stop taking them with your pack is gone it will be less bleeding.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	I don't think there's really a way to stop taking it and not have irregular periods. try talking to your doctor about it. When i got off BC and had weird periods or would sometimes miss my period my doctor gave me a lot of options all which i decided not to take because I didn't wanna decrease my chances of getting pregnant. it's best to just go with the flow I'd say and let things happen. good luck!|`|d7bJIgqlaa	You may be just fine!  I stopped taking mine two weeks ago when I was at the end of my pack.  I had my normal period of 4-5 days.  Now I feel fine.  Obviously it hasn't been long so who knows when the next will come, but I haven't had any sign yet.  I hope the same for you!|`|7iMZ91K7aa	When I asked my doctor this question, she told me that you just stop taking them... Like, right now.. It doesnt matter when you stop taking them, because your body will naturaly get back on track.. So stop taking them now! Throw those suckers away and start baby dancing!
eDmdkUO3aa	Like, the others suggested, you need to go see your OBGYN|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	see your doctor.....please.|`|uuHPneEcaa	u should get a doctor appointment as soon as possible. since u just discovered u where pregnant. I am sure nothing is wrong but u should still set up a appointment|`|u4FUeppNaa	Light spotting is usually nothing to worry about. If the bleeding gets heavy, you pass clots, or have bad cramps you should definitely go to the doctor/hospital because that could mean your having a miscarriage. Just to be safe i would call your doctor so they can check you out.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Could be implantation bleeding or sometimes I would bleed a little after a pap or internal when I was pregnant. But if you want to check I am sure the Dr. will be able to calm your fears.|`|3a8c03abddba3f41c749843651814e92aa	Your best bet is to call your ob/gyn and get in asap to see what is going on.|`|1UrMbDZHaa	i actually had a regular heavy bleeding period during my pregnancy (before i thought i was pregnant...it tricked me) so i wouldn't worry too much. you do need to set up an appointment with a doctor though immediately. they will just make you take another test and check your hcg levels. once your hcg hits 2400 then you can get an ultrasound to see if everything is alright. be open when you talk to your doctor. he/she will know best.|`|9ro8fiKvaa	See your Dr or OB - it'll ease your worries. The bleeding may just be excess from your uterine lining getting rid of itself as your body adjusts to the new life inside of you. I have heard of many women having bleeding during pregnancy and carry healthy babies to full term. Again, speak to your health professionsl - he/she will recommend testing and/or ease your fears. Try not to worry!|`|8LBl7HgAaa	Dont worry sweetie! It could have been implantation spotting when the baby attaches itself to your uterus. Sometimes it's normal to bleed after sex since you have extra blood flow to your cervix and anything like sex or a vaginal exam can trigger it again. Congrats and be happy! If you are spotting non-stop, contact your doc where she can send you to get a hcg blood test to check your hormone levels. Congrats!|`|6PR8Cj2raa	Well I cant say for sure cause im not a doctor. But I do know having sex can cause spotting for some people. It did for me this pregnancy, and I was told to kinds hold off for a while with having sex. I had a miscarriage a few months ago too so that maybe why. I would tell your doctor, because they say to tell your doctor about any bleeding/spotting!! Good luck|`|jZQen1pzaa	You are pregnant if you get a positive result. Go to the Dr, i am sure you are good. CONGRATS
kTu7UtS1aa	Well, I don't think that you are crazy because you want to keep this to yourself.  I am in the same situation right now, which is why I took a HPT today (my AF is due on Sunday).  I have a birthday party to attend and if I'm pregnant, I don't want to drink.  I don't want to  have to explain to anyone just yet if we are or aren't  We went through a m/c in Dec and it was difficult enough with everyone calling on us every minute to see how we were doing.  This time, if I am preg,  I want to keep it quiet until some time has passed.  Even when people know that you are "trying", they will constantly ask you "Well, did it happen yet?"  It gets a bit old after a while.  So, I know where you are coming from.  I only hope that your husband is stressing as much as you are and that his words came from that and not that he actually meant them.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.  I hope you both resolve this issue.  Feel free to email me if you need to vent.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	its just a difference of opinion and you're both entitled to think differently - however, he's probably just upset you're letting it control your social life (my husband would be).  here's what you do.. you go to the party, you go into the bathroom with a beer, empty it, rinse it and fill it with water - sip on it and no one will know!! :)|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	WOW I am really sorry about that. I don't think you're crazy I feel the same way, I haven't told anyone we are trying to conceive b/c I don't want to feel that pressure of ppl expecting that I'm just going to be pregnant and asking over and over again. Maybe (this is just a maybe) he changed his mind about having a child and doesn't want to admit that it's because of him and he's finding an easy way to put the blame on you. My best advice is if you arent pregnant use protection again he doesn't sound ready for a baby.  As for the party you should just let him go and he can tell friends you arent feeling good any little white lie. Guys just think way differently than we do! keep your head up hun and good luck!|`|1xlV9l0saa	Your prob not prego you are wanting it way to much and if you relax a little it will just happen.  You should go and just slow sip on the same drink....People are not going to be that interested in what you are drinking....I have never noticed someone elses drink to the extent you are talking about.  <br>  Good Luck and Calm down a little.|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	You have nothing to worry about, your feelings are completely rational and normal. Any woman ttc will tell you this. I understand your husband, but only because he`s not really understanding you. For some men, it seems stupid not to tell people about ttc because he`s not as desperate as you, he`s probably not day dreaming about having a baby in his arms like you are. He`s not thinking about baby names and what colors you`re going to paint the new room. He`s being patient about it and wants you to be. It`s eaiser said than done, of course and this is what your husband doesn`t understand. <br>  But you need to explain to him that having a baby for you is important and it`s your decision to tell people or not. Just like men envision themselves working a great finance and feel MEN by working hard and providing...a woman envisions herself with a baby, and raising that child.<br>  I just read this a few days ago and it helped me and my husband a lot to understand each other. <br>  <br>  What are the most common pitfalls for couples facing fertility problems?<br>  The most common pitfall is the assumption that your partner will feel the same things you do at the same time. This almost never happens. Most often, the woman tends to be ahead of the man. She's probably the one who wanted to start trying to get pregnant. She's also usually first to recognize there may be a problem, and is usually ready to seek more aggressive treatment earlier, and ready to discuss adoption first. The opposite is also sometimes true, but it's rare.<br>  <br>  The best way to avoid problems that arise from having different reactions, feelings, and ideas is to not assume or demand that your partner feel the same way you do. Allow each other the space to talk about what you're going through individually. Your way may be best for you, but it isn't necessarily best for your spouse. Also, keep in mind that women usually express more distress over fertility problems than men do.<br>  Why do women seem to suffer so much more than their male partners?<br>  Most women are raised to think that they'll become mothers someday. From the first baby doll to the last baby shower, girls and women are surrounded by images and expectations from parents, peers, religion, advertising, and the media.<br>  <br>  For some women, motherhood is a large part of their self-image as a female. For others, it's their highest ambition. Even women who don't necessarily want to become mothers are aware of social expectations to do so.<br>  <br>  The pressures to marry and raise a family can be enormous — to the extent that women who are unable to do those things can feel as though something must be deeply wrong with them or sorely lacking in their lives.<br>  <br>  Men are not pressured in the same way to become fathers. And many men are brought up to repress their feelings or at least keep them to themselves.<br>  <br>  A man may be feeling similar frustration and disappointment as he and his partner go through yet another treatment and yet another month without a pregnancy. But many see their role as being strong for their partner. Or they may be so used to holding in their feelings that they don't know what they feel or that they can ask for help.<br>  <br>  If the fertility problem is clearly his, such as poor sperm quality, then a man's image of himself can start to suffer.<br>  <br>  Studies show that, as a group, women with fertility problems are as anxious and depressed as women with cancer, heart disease, or HIV. One reason for this may be the physical demands of fertility treatments — blood tests, pills, daily hormone injections, ultrasounds, egg retrievals, and surgery can all be a source of stress and emotional upheaval in women.<br>  <br>  Also, society often fails to recognize the grief caused by infertility, so people denied parenthood tend to hide their sorrow, which only increases their feelings of shame and isolation.<br>  <br>  Learn how to avoid the most common pitfalls for couples facing fertility problems. And see a list of resources that can help you and your partner cope.<br>  <br>  Your husband should read this because he needs to understand you as a woman, not as just a person. He needs to understand that this is personal to you and if I were you, I wouldn`t go, period. You don`t have to put yourself in a position you don`t want to be in, you just don`t have to.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Sorry it`s long, but I hope it helps you. Let me know how it goes. <br>  You can visit www.babycenter.com under getting pregnant for more great advice.|`|MmQi03oXaa	If someone asks you why you aren't drinking, what's the harm in saying that you are trying to have a baby? That doesn't mean you are or are not pregnant, it just means you're trying. Any responsible mother-to-be should stop drinking/smoking/doing drugs prior to getting pregnant, so your friends shouldn't have a problem with it.|`|8a949c7984d501f70f4b690183ae5920aa	Wow!  I ordered ginger ale in a wine glass while nobody was looking.  Everyone thought i was drinking chardonnay.  Problem solved.
wQxgnHfMaa	You can take your pill on time and he can wear a condom....and you could still be pregnant.  Yes, you should be worried.....however, don't make a big deal out of this until you're late.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	You're probably OK, as long as you're usually good about taking your pill.  Six hours shouldn't make a difference. <br>  Yes, you should try to take it around the same time every evening, but the problems for the most part come when you forget to take it for a day or two, or you're *very* haphazard in the way you take it.  Taking it one evening six hours later shouldn't make a difference.|`|wS6qlnuLaa	It depends also on the last time you got your period, and how long you've been taking the pill. The longer you have been taking the pill, the less likely you are to be pregnant, and the closer it was to your last period the less likely you are to be pregnant|`|2dzY4PtYaa	Sure, it's possible you got pregnant.  But I'd need to see a videotape of this encounter first to give you a more accurate answer.|`|c7KCto2Raa	absolutely!! your chances are 95%
yDWcYXl5aa	I think in the adoption sense, adoptive parents don't know what's happened in the pregnancy, for things like early alcohol abuse, and they don't have the medical history of the bio mother to know what could be going on.<br>  <br>  I know of AP's who chose to not have bio children because they know of disabilities that run in their bio families.  I also knew of a birth mother who had several children she chose not to keep because of the birth defect of cleft palate.  She had 4 children before one was born without the condition-she kept that child.  (not a winner of a mom in my category).  <br>  <br>  In a way, it's a win-win for the child to be prepared for the worst, and in others it's a way of being rejected from before birth (many times, expectant moms have low birth weight babies when they know of birth defects, which can be attibuted to stress during the pregnancy).  <br>  <br>  When our son's first mom was pregnant, I made the decision in my own heart to love him just as if I gave birth and went through the pregnancy myself.  If he'd come out purple and 3 legged, I'd have loved him and he'd been the most beautiful baby in the world to me.  I am so blessed that even though his first mom chose to do meth, that he has fully recovered and is thriving in our home.|`|7JEojMgQaa	I think this is a good question because the way I see it, if we get too carried away with modern technology and allow only the perfect children to be born, it could cut down on lots of illness, deformities, and in general, medical bills.  But it sets up an unreal scenario, because none of us is perfect and we stand a very good chance of wiping ourselves out. <br>  <br>  This has a familiar ring to it, what was that guys name? <br>  <br>  Not exactly the same, but close enough for me. <br>  <br>  So I will go with nnnnno|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	They might offer screening to the expectant mother.  The potential adopters have no business ordering tests whilst the child is still in utero as it's not their baby. so yes, that would be unethical.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	It's unethical for doctors to attempt to intimidate and coerce parents into having the testing when they don't want it, and that does happen.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	Is it ethical? Are you kidding?<br>  <br>  One side is to say Adoptive Parents should not even think for one moment our baby's or children could ever be just Blank Slates... <br>  <br>  One Side says we should forever understand that genetics and medical history is of most important value in the role we play.<br>  <br>  One side says that we are ignorant and selfish to treat our children as if they have No Past history...<br>  <br>  And, then we are Wrong too for wanting to know about the Disability We will Parent for the Years and Years and possibly forever?<br>  <br>  Is it ethical to consider the family medical history before creating a baby? Is it ethical to have amniocentesis and abort for the the fact of a disability? <br>  <br>  Is it ethical to place a life into the hands of unprepared parents, expect them to honor the primal wound, be open in every way--and NOT know what the Heck the child might need once placed?<br>  <br>  Yeah, ummm I think it is ethical not only that but, I think it should be Mandatory--might help end the rates of disruption/dissolution if parents were able to have a little clue what their child's needs might be for the next Rest of their Lives! <br>  <br>  It seems some people believe Adoption is all about Getting the Prize and forget that the Parents are the ones who stand by and raise children they love for their whole lives. For parents Adoption is not just a temporary solution--It's a Lifetime Commitment and sometimes it's a lifetime committment for permanent problems.|`|8U4NMYOvaa	Yes, in my case if i were to have a test done and it showed that there were abnormalities or the child was going to have a disibility i would prepare myself to the max with what i will need to do to help the baby as best i can. i don't believe in abortion so i wouldn't consider that|`|GJqyVNFqaa	Yes, it would be unethical not to. Who wants to go through life having a severe disability or caring for someone that does?|`|AA11987492	Yes, if nothing else, it gives the parents time to prepare themeselves to deal with a childs disability.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	in ways yes. i chose not to know . because knowing you still cant change anything . and you really only dread the child coming to be honest . i know thats mean but . if someone told you you has cancer all you would think about is dying . or told you that in 5 months you would develope cancer and they couldnt do a thing about it .|`|2wyDALHgaa	If the College of Physicians determines that it's ethical (which I believe it has), then it has.<br>  <br>  If the question is does it fit with the personal ethics of anyone here, well thats a different question.

d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	I would do it at a park or in someones back yard.  Maybe make it a little less baby shower like and a little more like a celebration for the new baby.  I wouldn't play any of the overdone typical shower games (baby bingo, men drinking from the bottles the fastest, guess this nursery rhyme, etc).  You could do a BBQ and just have typical activities for that type of setting like horseshoes, badmitten, etc. You should still have the cake and you can have everyone come together to watch you open gifts and maybe have everyone (men and women) write down a piece of advice on a card and then have the father-to-be read them outloud.  Could be pretty comical as I am sure the men will have much different advice than the women.  <br>  <br>  Have fun with it.|`|faPKwClPaa	Absolutely!  Men and women were invited (couples, usually) and everyone had a great time.  Showers are just for women anymore. :-)|`|oDGpmkMaaa	I've been to a co-ed shower. It was held at someones home. The girls did their own thing and the guys BBQ and drank. They did the games to. Like diapering the baby, the guys won!. I'm not from LA so I don't know where a good place would be but someones house, but then you have the parking dilemma. Is someone throwing the shower? I would asked them where they were thinking or if its for the mommy ask her where she would want it.|`|HqOkC2YHaa	My shower was sopposed to be co-ed (my bf, and his work mates because we are all friends) I planned it on a sat because no one had to work....but when the day came all the boys had to goto work because they had a big crown moulding job to do and wanted to get a head start on it as to not put all their other booked jobs in waiting...I guess that is the life of a contractor lol<br>  <br>  I did still have 2 guys there...we played the guess how much my belly is around, the don't cross your leg game (of course one of the guys won that hahaha) and the due date predictor which everyone was far off by a long shot!|`|7bdhpvc9aa	Our babyshower was with both woman and men. One of the games that you can include the guys in is have them each diaper a baby doll with powder, diaper rash cream, wipes and everything and whoever does it the fastest wins. Have them diaper the baby doll at the same time.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	i had 2 like that|`|b99kfMPcaa	My first baby shower was a couple's shower, and it was a blast!!  I don't live in L.A., but I can tell you how mine went.  My parents threw it for me.  We had a luau theme because it was in the summer, and that was the theme of my son's baby room.  My mom managed to get the men more involved in the games.  We had alcohol, (I didn't drink of course), but everyone else had beer and jell-o shots.  It was great.  She put beer into baby bottles and had the men see who could drink the baby bottle empty the fastest.  Also, she put jar baby food into diapers and the guys had to guess what food it was by smelling it and/or tasting it.  It looked completely disgusting, but was funny to watch.  We also did a game where everyone had to guess how many toilet paper squares fit around my belly.  The closest guess won.  <br>  <br>  My second baby shower was not so much a baby shower, but was more of a BBQ.  It was also coed.  We just let the kids swim and the men cooked the meat.  There were no games, but I did open gifts.  That one was fun to because it was more of a get together/party/celebration type event.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	thats how i did mine. we did it at my moms house in the back yard and just had mini sandwiches, chips/dips, fruit, pasta salad, etc. and played simple games like finish the nursery rhyme, guess how much string it takes to go around moms tummy, guess how many candies are in the bottle, a memory game, and a diaper raffle. ive seen others do it in the park too...gives it a more relaxed and inviting atmosphere so the guys can kinda hang out while girls open gifts, etc.|`|ic2B0y7zaa	I had a co-ed baby shower and it was so much fun! We just moved into a bigger house with a pool so we had the shower at our house. You can have different games just for the guys: <br>  have the guys drink beer out of a bottle, the first one done wins.<br>  have the girls feed the guys baby food (fruit) blind folded.<br>  A lot of fun!!|`|EeGgovyCaa	I have been to one. During the shower the guys, including the father mostly stayed outside or in the garage. Smoking and playing poker or something. While the ladies stayed inside playing games. When it came to open presents, everyone came inside. The mom and dad opened together.|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	I just wanted my hubby at mine.  I can't say that any of our other male friends would have actually wanted to be there.  They may have showed up had they been invited out of obligation, but I don't think "want" would have played a part, hahaha!  They really are pretty girly events.  I have no idea as far as your locale.  I'm on the east coast.  Although I will say that having it in a more intimate location is really nice.  I had mine at a family members home. It was cozy and me and my guests really enjoyed it.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? both of my baby showers were with guys and girls, because I have a father, brother, grandpa, husband and etc.. that I wanted involved in celebrating the baby.|`|a1uoxczTaa	my brother had boys and girls at his baby shower. i think it is completely normal and i like the idea. with boys and girls there they didnt really have any games and the ones i been to they didnt really have any games either.|`|FsFUo4VJaa	I did this it was so fun you can do all the radom games that you would play with just girls but I added the beer bottle chug that was fun Google it it is the funniest game ever.|`|xApAWlshaa	I'd like to go to your shower it would be nice.tell meh how it goes.yes guys would like to go to a shower.just elaborate no that no women will actually be taking a shower nakkked together.they will be sad first but after a while they will understand.<br>  wow i was the first man to answer i deserve sumtin fo dat|`|n4kIQYchaa	My baby showers were mixed up with guys and girls. It was so funny watching the guys play the games. We played common games but the best one was trying to figure out what kind of chocolate was in the diaper so funny watching people smelling a diaper.|`|cix2DEbbaa	I`m going to have some guys are my shower as well, the only games i came up with that they would want to play (ones just for guys) is the bottle chugging contest, filling baby bottles with apple juice or milk & having them chug!|`|iFDye9RMaa	We did a couples shower, and had a bbq at my parents house.

igbdywwVaa	I'm 9 weeks and it's said the embryo is about grape size. Sadly, it sounds like you've miscarried. I'm so sorry. I went through that this past fall for a month and a half until I finally had a D&C to clear everything out that wouldn't pass on its own...I miscarried at approx. 7.5 wks. I know how emotionally difficult it is. <br>  <br>  UNLESS you were pregnant with twins and you miscarried just one, then you might still be pregnant but it would be seen on the ultrasound. <br>  <br>  To try and give you some uplifting hope, I got pregnant before I even had a period after my D&C. Basically, my D&C was like a period and I ovulated about the time I should have if I had had a period. My due date and such was calculated from the day of my D&C (like the first day of my period). Hopefully that helps if you want to try and get pregnant again right away and not wait until your first or second regular period. (However, if you want to contact me, I'll give you my opinion as to why I wished I would have waited a few months after having gone through a miscarriage)<br>  <br>  I'm very sorry for your loss but am very hopeful that you will be back to mommy-to-be soon!<br>  <br>  Take care!<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I see you wrote some additional info so I thought I would respond to that. When I first started miscarrying, I passed the embryo. It was just a red glob. I couldn't understand how things were so visible on the U/S and that's all I saw. My doctor also said there would be no way they'd know what it was. About a week later I passed some grey matter...and towards the end I passed a yellowish glob. I called to ask what THAT was...was it possibly the mucus plug? Again, I was told they didn't know and wouldn't be able to know. But since I had so many ultrasounds, I knew the embryo passed early on. Don't take any HPT's since you might still have the HCg hormones and that would give you false hope. The ultrasound gave you everything you need to know (I'm sorry to say that). You could go in and get blood tests every few days but in my opinion, you'd be wasting time and money. But hopefully your doctor will check again via ultrasound to make sure your uterus is empty (if that hasn't been done already). You don't want to "try" again until you're sure that you are no longer pregnant and all the products of conception have been expelled- for the reason of getting pregnant again and to make sure you won't need a D&C as I did. As I mentioned though, once everything is clear and you're done bleeding, you can start trying again if you really want to.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You passed the baby. You are not pregnant. I'm sorry.|`|8RfmosODaa	I'm sorry it sounds like you had a miscarriage. They can usually see the heartbeat by 9 weeks, sorry. I know it is hard to except I have been thur it too and thought we'll maybe i still am pregnant but I'm not. Best luck to you.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I am sorry but it sounds as though you passed your baby.  I had a miscarriage at 8 weeks.  I passed a lot of gray tissue and had some heavy bleeding for a few days.  The ultrasound would have shown a heartbeat if you were still pregnant.<br>  I also researched this with my miscarriage and wanted so badly to still be pregnant but it just wasn't so.  I did however get pregnant again 4 weeks later and am now 18 weeks pregnant.|`|v3LnJycKaa	no they actually say that fetal tissue is greyish in color, not bright red so the "grape" may have very likely been fetal tissue.. I am sorry.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Nope, sorry.|`|vGHaYp6Naa	nope....sorry.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	no, sorry. i would say you did lose the baby. i had a lot of pain early on in my second pregnancy and told the doctor i thought something was wrong at my first appointment at 6 weeks. he said it was 'normal' and everything was fine. i had already had one child and knew i wasnt fine. when i went back at 10 weeks, the baby had no heart beat and had stopped growing already. had to have a dnc. so i know this is a hard time for you. to give you some hope though, i was able to get pregnant again almost right away and i now have a healthy 11 month old son. i had some heavy bleeding around 7 weeks with him and went to the er where they told me i probably wasnt even pregnant and that it was my period but after several tests they confirmed i was pregnant and had no explanation for the bleeding. it went away in a few hours and no problems after that.

AA11296427	?Odd jobs?<br>  <br>  - Breath odor evaluator<br>  What they do: Odor judges smell nasty morning breath or breath “insulted” with strong scents, like garlic or coffee. They rate the breath on a scale from one to nine, one being the worst. To test odor-reducing products like gum or mouthwash, they smell the breath again and assign it a new rating.<br>  <br>  - Ribbon candy puller<br>  What they do: After a heated combination of sugar, corn syrup, water and coloring agent has cooled, batches of different colors are laid out side by side. Someone then pulls the candy thin until it’s about an inch wide. The final product is a multicolored hard candy.<br>  <br>  - Ball tester<br>  What they do: Assess basketballs, footballs, volleyballs and soccer balls for air-retention, inflation, roundness, weight and reboundability.<br>  <br>  - Video game tester<br>  What they do: For eight hours a day, five days a week, a group of males and females of all ages play video games. They repeat levels, games and characters, looking for any bugs and/or glitches in the software.<br>  <br>  - Tampon tester<br>  What they do: Check all sizes of tampons for absorbency and cord strength in accordance with Food and Drug Administration standards. Most testers check up to 125 pieces per day.<br>  <br>  - Gold reclaimer<br>  What they do: Scour old teeth for fillings, melting the gold from them with broken gold jewelry into tiny gold pellets, which are then resold to jewelers.<br>  <br>  - Dog sniffer<br>  What they do: Once a week, they analyze the odor of dogs' breath to test the effect of the animals' diet on their teeth. Breath is graded on a scale of zero to 10 and is categorized as sweaty, salty, musty, fungal or decaying.<br>  <br>  - Potato chip inspector<br>  What they do: Search for overcooked or clumped chips to discard as they come down the assembly line.<br>  <br>  - Porta-potty service<br>  What they do: Like regular restrooms, portable toilets need maintenance, too.

First, wig makers create a plastic model of the wearer’s head and hairline, and then they transfer the mold onto a padded canvas similar to the client’s general head size, covering it with wig lace. Using a needle, they knot and pull thousands of hairs, one by one, through the mesh cap. Once all the hairs are in place, the wig is styled to the wearer’s preference.<br>  <br>  - Paper towel sniffer<br>  What they do: Paper towel manufacturers prefer their products to be odorless before, during and after their use.

YOmLsgYRaa	I had a miscarriage at the beginning of September. It was a natural miscarriage and it took a while to get my first period just like you. my periods never really got back to normal, but my last period was at the beginningg of January and I conceived at the end of January. I am now 8 weeks pregnant, and I am so excited. I was in agony for the months that I was not able to conceive once we began trying again. My advice, try to concentrate on something else going on in your life for a few months. For me, I concentrated on getting my real estate license and the next thing I knew, I was pregnant! good luck!|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	I had a miscarriage last month at 4 wks.

I heard its easier to get pregnant right after a miscarriage so thats what im hopin for. good luck and im very sorry about your loss. I kow how hard it is
mc6YtaRbaa	You can take a test, make sure you get the most sensitive one you can find. Some women won't get a positive this early, and others will. It depends on how your body produces hCG. I would get one that comes with 2 in the box. Take one today and if negative wait until you miss your period then test again.|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	The tests are more accuarte if you wait until after you miss your period.  If you want to take it early then make sure you use your 1st morning pee.  The directions on/in the box should let you know how accurate it is when you take it early.<br>  <br>  I was never good about waiting until my period was late.  I always wanted to know early too.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  It takes a while for most people to get prego.  Don't get too sad if it's negative.<br>  <br>  "Once you discontinue the use of birth control, and try to become pregnant:<br>  <br>  <br>  25 in the first month <br>  60 in six months <br>  75 in nine months <br>  80 in twelve months <br>  90 in eighteen months"

s4LWmcTjaa	Oh believe me I know that spanking and abuse are two very different things.  You don't have to explain to me :)  I'm a reasonable person.  I know that a responsible spanking is far from just hitting your child because you are angry or frustrated with them.<br>  <br>  The reason that I chose not to spank my children is because of my problems with anger.  I choose not to put myself in a position where I could potentially lose control of my temper.  I know my limitations and I will not exceed them.<br>  <br>  That's not to say that there aren't many wonderful parents out there who can and do maintain good self control and who carry out a spanking in a responsible way.  Good for them!  <br>  <br>  I certainly don't hold myself above other parents who choose to spank and I don't think that all children should be disciplined the same.  All children are different.  It's about finding what is effective for your own.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Because hitting doesn't teach anything.  It just controls.  And, I can keep my children safe & behaving politely without hitting them, so why would I choose to hit?  <br>  <br>  I don't want to just control my kids with fear of punishment until they are grown & no longer my problem.  I want to teach them how to make good decisions for themselves, whether I'm there to punish them or not.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	I havent spanked my daughter....yet. she's just made 14 months so up until now, we havent because we feel hitting her cause she's bad will teach her to hit when shes mad at someone. like how can i tell her not to hit by hitting her myself? now that shes gettng older, we may start giving her spankings. she is very naughty at times and I am sure the spankings will def come in due time. We just wanted to wait until she can understand WHY shes being spanked|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	I don't because I don't believe it is okay to teach kids it is okay to hit people. I don't believe in making my child learn things by hurting her. I want her to understand why she can't do certain things, not be afraid of getting a spanking if she does something bad.|`|AA11210211	I don't believe in spanking because I don't like to inflict pain on my children.Spanking is a form of hitting and hitting inflicts pain.I feel that spanking doesn't teach them anything but that it is okay to hit.Granted yes all children are different but this is how I see it.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	Because how am I supposed to tell my daughter not to hit people if I hit her? I remember being spanked ONE time as a child because I ran into a parking lot while with my parents. Other than that, I learned how to behave through example, not fear of being hit. And sorry, spanking IS hitting no matter how you look at it.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	Parents are afraid to spank, because spanking is<br>  politically incorrect in this day and age.<br>  <br>  <br>  I was spanked, and here's a survey on whether you were spanked or not.

For a couple of reasons.<br>  <br>  I do not believe in using physical violence to solve problems.   I do believe in standing up for yourself, and want to teach my children to do this without the use of physical violence.  And I want to be a role model for this.  I also believe children should be treated as well as adults - who it is against the law to strike.<br>  <br>  Secondly, why I am against others spanking is that other authority figures in children's lives cant use it on them.  If a child is de-sensitized to other types of discipline, where does that leave our teachers.<br>  <br>  Also for those who do cross the line, who you do feel do abuse, do you honestly think most of them will admit to that.  Maybe they are just "discipining" their children.<br>  <br>  <br>  You really can't get any simpler than "Do onto others as you would wish them do onto you."<br>  <br>  When Im old, demented, in a child like state, and my kids taking care of me - I really dont want them whoppin me.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i don't spank and i don't let my son get away with everything either- and when he is older to his room he will go and he'll stay there all dady if he doesn't learn a lesson from it. spanking jsut sends a message that it's ok to inflict pain on someone when you are angry. i was spanked and it didn't teach my a thing.SPANKING doesn't teach ANYTHING other than you do something wrong then your parent's will hit you. so for me it just taught me to not get caught. i am firm but i don't hit- why would i want to inflict pain on my child? and there are many kdis who aren't spanked who learn right from wrong. my friend's kdis were never spanked ( she ahs 3) and they are the best behaved kids in a crowd and they respect adults. i remember flintching when my dad raised his hand, he didn't beat me but i did crap wrong and didn't know when i would get spanked. a child shouldn't have to fear their parents to respect them|`|ngDjTbTnaa	I don't spank, hit or punish my kids physically because I was beaten as a kid by my parents, and grew up with physical and mental abuse. I needed Therapy and more things to get a normal life. I talk and give my boys warnings and finally time-outs. If they get smart I take away their favorite toys. That works wonders!!|`|t9S0dqfLaa	Spanking just doesn't make sense to me.  Example~ smack your kid for hitting?  and then say "You don't hit"??  I don't think you should let your kids run around like wild animals but you can punish without spanking. Time out or take away a toy.  I don't judge people for spanking though.  I think it's a parents choice.|`|o23MmGOOaa	smacking does not work on my children, I find taking things they like off them  for a speciffic pereiod works the best, as they are reminded for more than 2 seconds that they need to think about there actions first|`|pnL5WTXMaa	because i don't want to create people who blindly follow rules without question.<br>  <br>  Also - don't assume you know what any of us really feel "deep down".|`|Cy9MmTzCaa	Some children really don't need to be spanked. I was never spanked, and I grew up just fine. I'm 18 now. What are bad things most 18-year-olds are accused of? Drugs, stealing, bad grades, messiness, selfishness? I don't do drugs, I've stolen one thing in my life (and a week later, without getting caught, returned it. I was 12), My grades average about a B-, my room is clean, and i babysit frequently for free both for family members and anyone else who asks, even last minute, so I'd say i'm not too selfish. I have my moments of course, but so does everyone else in the world.  Some children really don't need to be spanked|`|IRFbj0G9aa	Were you spanked?  I was, and now when I think about it I say gee don't ya think they could have sat and thought about other ways to deal with me.  Spanking is not a method to teach a child something.  At least it is not the most effective, sometimes it could do the opposite but I wont even open that can of worms.  Just cause there are people who choose not to spank, and I am one of them,  doesn't mean all our kids are a bunch of punks or products of spoiled psuedophsycho alternative crap.  Quite the opposite.  Parenting is about conveying millions of messages to a developing mind and personality.  Perhaps the people you know who choose not to spank, also choose NOT to take a firm action on the rearing of their children. Just cause you choose not to spank does not mean we put kids on autopilot and somehow they will get the point.  Kids need consistency, they need clear and definite boundaries. Meaning, no punishment at all = CHAOS.  Or idle threats the kid knows mom or dad wont follow through on.    Just cause a mom says don't do that. doesn't mean she is disciplining.  If child is informed of the consequence of continuing said behaviour, and continues, and mom follows through with the already declared punishment, that is an alternative form of discipline to spanking.   Do you see the difference now?  And trust me I prefer my child freaking out when I say that is it! You have lost your X privelage for X amount of days than them run for cover from fear  of being hit.  This is a very complex subject and really I haven't even scraped the surface.  Hope this enlightens you.  (AND I DON'T MEAN THAT IN A NEGATIVE OR INSULTING WAY, HONESTLY)  Ultimately we all do the best we can, the spankers and the non.  At least that is what the optimistic side of me likes to believe.|`|YP1DXbBDaa	Because as an adult, it's my responsibility to teach my children ways to resolve things that don't involve hitting or violence.  If our house rules are "We don't hit people" then spanking breaks that rule, and for children, especially young children, the world is very black and white-the idea of "what's in between" doesn't come until much later on, and if I want my children to learn that "hitting is not okay" then I can't go around hitting, even as discipline.  <br>  <br>  Because hitting my children is a violation of the trust between parent and child-it teaches children that even though we tell them to trust us as adults and guides in their lives that sometimes we do things that we know hurt them and that we don't always follow our own rules.  Most importantly, it tells children "it's okay for big people to hit little people" or "strong people can hit weak people" and that's not good. <br>  <br>  Spanking teaches children that they're bad, not that the behavior is bad. Children are hit, they get a hug and the connection becomes "If I hug Daddy, maybe he'll stop hitting" not "If I don't do that, I won't get hit."  Making a child help clean up the mess from the spilled milk or the crayon on the wall makes the punishment relevant to the misbehavior and connects the two actions.  Spanking doesn't do that. <br>  <br>  Spanking is disempowering to children.  It teaches them that they are weak and defenseless.  It takes away an opportunity to learn new skills and tactics for resolving problems and for real lessons to come out of misbehavior.  <br>  <br>  None of this means that children shouldn't be disciplined...they need structure and guidance, they need good rules and consequences.  But these things can be achieved without hitting children.  <br>  <br>  As a side note, as a non-parent, sometimes it's hard to know what is and isn't age-appropriate behavior.  Before assuming that your cousins are misbehaving, it might be good to find out whether or not what they're doing that looks like it's mischievous is really just normal exploration and activity for children that age. Some things that look like misbehaving are really things children are supposed to be doing.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	My kids are well-behaved, without it. (I have 4.)<br>  <br>  I teach them that NOBODY hits them... How can I get them to understand that their future partner *cannot* hit them, if I, myself---who loves them, and whom they love---were to hit them? In short, I can't, without being a hypocrite, and I don't give a rat's bum about thumbs down from people who can't handle differing opinions. :)<br>  <br>  *edited* The question is for those of us who do *not* spank; not for those who *do* to jump in and play with the thumbs down button. ;)|`|3Psi4kBxaa	For one reason there are far better ways to solve problems.

1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	My spouse and I have similar beliefs; not exactly the same.<br>  <br>  Your situation would seem challenging.  I am an atheist and feel similarly about raising our children.  I am open to them learning about any and all religions and choosing one when and if they desire.  We try to teach our children to accept all people regardless of their religious beliefs, race, sexual orientation, etc.|`|vue9NOhYaa	We have different beliefs. I am Jewish, he is 'raised-Baptist-but-not-really-anything-... <br>  <br>  We agreed when we married that children would be raised Jewish. So he is respectful of my beliefs, and I am respectful of his.  And our daughter is raised Jewish, and is respectful of other choices.|`|ygimTNzoaa	I'm Atheist, my man's Catholic. I'm 5 months pregnant, and pretty much feel the exact same way you do about raising kids. I do think I refuse to argue about religion in front of the kid. Well, argue about anything really.|`|1s3nddaYaa	i am agnostic and my b/f claims "satanism" bull huh|`|UYfqzCoMaa	My husband is an atheist and I am the non denomination Christian. I believe in God and he doesn't. We don't really talk about it. We respect each others views and I don't try to push anything on him and he doesn't push anything on me. If our children want to go to church or learn about religion then we are both open to it because they are our children and we love them no matter what religion they are if any.|`|rjVALevtaa	Like you, I am an atheist and my husband is Jewish. I have accepted his beliefs and although I do not agree with them, I do respect them. <br>  <br>  He wants to teach our boys about God when they are older and I have no problem with this. I think children should be exposed to all sorts of religion so that they can decide for themselves.|`|YBQvzEhGaa	Yes we actually met at church. However, he was raised as a Christian and Christianity was not as important in my family growing up. He has a tendency to push the whole church going thing a lot more than I do.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	I was raised Catholic, my husband is an atheist. We rarely discuss religion at all, I'm not a practicing Catholic.|`|prqrQcd1aa	We both have similar beliefs. We are both open minded as well.|`|0QYIbn1saa	Yes, we have the same religious beliefs.  We are both agnostic.|`|COecrPrMaa	My fiance is an Atheist.  I believe in God.  I think for me is was a little more difficult to get around the differences... I wasn't even going to give him a chance because of how many Atheists have made jokes about me and made fun of me for believing in God.  I just felt that it was right to give him a chance, tho, and I did.  I'm glad I did.  He doesn't believe in what I believe in but he will sit up and talk about it with me (because he knows so much about the Bible) and he has never made fun of me and told me that if I was to ask him to come to church with me that he would... for me and because I ASK.  (His mother and people in his family never INVITE him to church... the just tell him that he NEEDS to go and that irritates him.)  But I won't ask him to do something he doesn't want to do.  It is different because I've never been with an Atheist.  My brother is an Atheist, but like you butting heads over how to raise your kids, it IS a completely different aspect to actually be in a relationship with someone with a different religion or belief.  I do like my fiance's outlook tho... He has a daughter, and so do I (none together) and he said if his daughter wants to go to church he will let her believe in what she wants and live whatever way she wants.  I think that is fair enough.|`|JjbragXNaa	We do now, but at first we sure didn't.  It can tend to cause strain if one or both feel passionately about their spiritual beliefs.  But I would let your children decide for themselves and probably go with your hubby to church (if he goes).  I mean, if you don't believe in God, what does it matter?  The best thing for you to do is get really good at being in your husbands and your children's shoes.  Sure, you may not believe what they do, but try to think of what it's like for them to feel that way.  That will help you understand their positions better.  And support them 100% in any spiritual decision that they make.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	I'm a catholic and my husband is an atheist.<br>  I'm not a diehard catholic - i go to mass and pray, but i'm not a bible basher, i wouldn't call myself religious at all...and my husband, although has he points of view - he's not a diehard atheist either.<br>  <br>  We are going to raise our children catholic in the very beginning like baptize them and all (with his consent) but i'm going to allow them choose when it comes time for them to make their own decisions.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	I'm in a similar position, being largely agnostic with a fiancee who was raised catholic.  We don't generally have any problems in that department- in most matters, our personal views coincide as she is not hugely religious and leans toward the tolerant side of Christianity, which is what I admire.  As far as children go, I'm happy for them to receive a Christian education- I did.|`|9qmWUg6xaa	My wife and I are in a very similar situation.  She is Catholic, I'm Atheist.  She wants our children to grow up Catholic, I frankly don't care, it's their own decision.  The only significant issues that come up are that I will not teach them religion, and I will not encourage (or discourage) them regarding church.  It's their life, and their choice.  We will raise them such that they can make an intelligent decision when the time comes.|`|IlSGU9Yzaa	yes. My wife and I are both Christian. My thought for you is this. The scriptures have sound advise for raising kids. Can you say that those scriptures are not beneficial? Or are you against that advise solely because it does come from the Bible? Because religious or not you can't deny the practicality in the scriptural advise. If its not hurting the kids then let it go.|`|z6IekuwSaa	My hubs is nondenominational and I'm methodist. So we don't fight too much about religion when it comes to raising our children. We make compromises. I agree to going to a non denom church and taking her with us and he agrees no drinking around her or having alcohol in the house. Everything is compromises.|`|2k8NmkENaa	im a catholic and he is anon  believer<br>  <br>  he only ask we dont get married in a church and i can take  the kids to church if i want and he isnt going.<br>  <br>  also no statues or religious things in the house.<br>  <br>  i only dislike when he talks crap to his friend for being a big believer.|`|YKCBzb8Uaa	No, I just deferred to her with regard to their spiritual upbringing. Out of the the three only one attends church regularly, but that probably has more to do with his wife than what we did for him.|`|UgX5WeGPaa	I'm not married but everyone i've ever been with has had the same religion as me... my city/neighborhood is HUGELY catholic!!|`|0ece3ea96233735c56393ae48382a64caa	Well, my ex GF and I actually broke up due to religious differences.

I would classify him more as spiritual than "religious".<br>  <br>  He understands why I believe (or don't believe) what I do, and I understand why he believes what he believes.  We are respectful of each others upbringings and families, and supportive of each others "spiritual needs" so-to-speak...<br>  <br>  We talk about religion often, usually prompted by a movie or a news story, or a documentary or something along those lines.  It's also something that we talked about extensively before we got married, and we discussed how it would effect future decisions, including children.<br>  <br>  It's a constant discussion, and it's constantly evolving, but there are certain aspects that we made decisions on.  For example:  I do not want my children to go to a religious school, whereas he when to Catholic school, so is partial to it.  We compromised - I am okay with him having the children baptized (it is his one big sticking point), but they will go to public school.<br>  <br>  I am okay with him taking them to church (he only goes maybe 3 or 4 times a year, and it's usually when something stressful has happened, and he feels the need to be close to his God... I understand this, and liken it to meditation), but I have asked them that they are exposed to other options - for example let them research Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, etc... or let them go with a friend to Mosque or Temple...<br>  <br>  I want them to have a bigger picture of spirituality and be able to choose for themselves what they believe, if anything.  I think there is HUGE value in learning abuot all the culture and history in religion, even if I don't agree with the superstition of it...   I just don't necessarily want them indoctinated and bombarded with all the fire and brimstone rhetoric...<br>  <br>  We celebrate Christmas with his family on Christmas eve, and on the 25th we just have a family day together at home with no religion involved.<br>  <br>  They will *not* be taught creationism - they will be taught about evolution and biology, and all the beautiful wonders of science (my hubby is a chemist and so he is on board with this all the way).<br>  <br>  There are many, many more examples, but this is getting really long, so I'll leave it at that!  <br>  <br>  Basically we just keep the conversation open and go with what feels right for both of us... if one of us is really not that adament on a topic, we will let the other have their way on it, and vica versa...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  :)|`|cg3IaThxaa	I'm an atheist, and very opened minded. If I found a guy I loved, his religion wouldn't matter. (Just as long as he's not sacrificing goats in his free time or anything.) I think it would be harder for a christian to be with an atheist though, because they'd think their loved one is going to hell. So it's probably very rare for people of opposite religions to get married, but it's possible, and I would be up for it. (But I'd probably try really hard to find a good atheist guy first.) As for kids, like I said I'm open minded too. If they want to be satanists or wiccans, I'm educated enough to know that neither of those are bad things, so more power to them! (: & congrats to you and your husband, you both sound like very mature individuals.|`|qImMwhUHaa	Well, I am a Christian and my husband says he's a Christian but it's like pulling teeth to get him to go to church and he drinks more than I think is acceptable. So, we collide too. He just doesn't want to put his beliefs into practice as much as I do. <br>  <br>  My sister is married to an  atheist. She was raised up Baptist and now that she has a child I think she would like to return to having a religion in her life but her husband makes very rude comments about Christians and doesn't have respect for people who are choose to believe in God. That's why it's important to marry within your own religion but it just doesn't always happen like that and people change their beliefs also.<br>  <br>  Really, Christian beliefs are just good morals and a good value system. So ,if you don't condemn his beliefs and you maintain a good value system for you and your children then things should be okay but there's always going to be differences, even if you were the same denomination.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Yes we do share the same religious beliefs.  We feel that it is important for our children to see us unified in our beliefs and values.  <br>  <br>  We are both non-denominational Christians.  I base my answer on a passage of scripture:<br>  <br>  "Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness?" (2 Cor. 6:14, KJV)<br>  <br>  I know I'll get some flack for the verse I gave, but that is what God commands of me as a believer.  I was not made righteous in His eyes until I placed my trust in Him.  <br>  <br>  I feel it's important for your children to see you and your spouse sharing the same beliefs.  My husband and I fully plan on sharing our beliefs with our children and raising then around those beliefs.  However it is up to our children to one day decide if they will trust God.  That is their decision alone.  We will love them regardless of their choice.<br>  <br>  However the fact that you said "We normally don't talk about religion otherwise we would be debating all the time" is one of the key reasons why I believe two people who don't share the same spiritual (or lack of spiritual) beliefs should not be joined in marriage.  I can be very stressful on the marriage and confusing for your children.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	LOL at jules vane<br>  <br>  my husband is Catholic and I am Christian. Neither or us are practicing. It was never been a problem except for the issue of getting our daughter baptized. His fam wanted to cause all the babies get baptized. I was against baptizing her Catholic since it is promsing to raise her Catholic. Plus neither of us belong to a church. So we decided not to and will teach her about the Bible and God but we will let her decide whether or not to be baptized when she is older
lkhCeAdJaa	I just say, 'Hey watch your mouth.  There are little children around."<br>  That usually works.|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	It depends on what the kids were like.  If they seem dangerous, I'd just walk away and get my kid away from them.  If they were normal kids just trying to be "bad" by cursing, then I might say something to them.  One time in 8th grade, when I was in choir, we were at a concert and there was an elementary choir there too.  This girl in my choir, who ALWAYS cussed, was cussing up a storm while a bunch of 9 year olds were standing right in front of her.  My friend and I just tapped her on the shoulder and whispered, "______, there are CHILDREN here!"  It's like she didn't even realize what she was doing until we told her, because she finally realized the kids in front of her and stopped.  It's sad how cussing has become such a normal thing for so many people, to the point that they aren't even thinking about it!|`|CRvdmFwCaa	First... tell the little Kids to cover their ears.  Then Yell, "SHUT the F**K UP you little P**KER HEADS."  Then once you have their attention, ask them politely if they could tone down their language around the little impressionable children- because you would be in so much trouble if you took them home to their parents repeating those profanities. :)  (you can leave out the yelling line...haha :) )  You're a good sister for being concerned!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I have been in this situation before but with my own children. I told the boys "hey don't you see the little kids around? I don't care what you do in your own time, but do not use that kind of language in front of my kids, it's disrespectful." They apologized and walked away.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	they're 13, they shouldn't be too big. lolz. tell them to stop being immature kids and shut up. Real adults don't talk like that.

I am going to e-mail you later today to talk about a babysitting client of mine, see what your thoughts are).<br>  <br>  I have had the same problem. I really think bad swearing has become so ubiquitous that many teens don't even realize they are doing it. It is just like an added adjective. Sad, I know.<br>  <br>  What I tend to do in this situation is just take the kiddos somewhere else. Most of the time, they don't even notice it, but sometimes they do. People should think before swearing around kids.<br>  <br>  If you wanted to, you could always say something, politely, like, "Could I just request you use milder language around little kinds?". Don't, though, if you feel uncomfortable.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	depends on the situation. If they seem kind of ruff or beligerent other than just cussing. I'd hold my kids back until we were out of ear shot then start walking again. If my kids seem wonder why; I'd tell them that I didn't like the language and felt we should hang back.<br>  If they seem like gentle kids just being mouthy, I'd ask them politely to curb the foul language around the little ones.|`|u7LSohRyaa	I guess you could talk to your kids about how much you appreciate nice words and how much dirty words bug you. People that swear are probably not going to respect you for telling them to shut up but you could try saying it in a respectful manner. Maybe ask them to talk like that somewhere else.|`|WPI0Z47saa	There isn't much you can do about others and saying things to strangers usually just makes them act up more. It is more important to talk to your kids and let them know that is not appropriate and tell them why. I hate it to.

If you notice your little brother watching or paying attention, make them sound stupid. I'd say wow you hear that? That sounds so bad and dirty... I guess.

I know it has to be hard to keep clean and you are scared about infection but the doctors assured you it would be ok. <br>  <br>  Stinks so bad your little man had to go through that but he will never remember!!!!! More pain for you I am sure. <br>  <br>  I will say a prayer for you adn your son!|`|8a949c7984d501f70f4b690183ae5920aa	my son at 6 months had a 7 hour surgery to remove most of his Liver.  he had cancer!  I was so afraid to hold him in the ICU that they really had to yell at me and make me remember that I am the mom and in charge of this child. <br>  My sisters son had open heart surgery at 7 months as well as the penis surgery.  Do everything the doctors tell you and keep positive.  He wil be very uncomfortable but it will get better.<br>  Be thankful you are dealing with a swollen penis and not a life threatening illness.  Alos know that this too shall pass.  <br>  My son is now cancer free and going to be five years old.|`|VCCKfT3taa	Let me just say that you are an amazing mother! And I'm sure his daddy is just as awesome. You two are going through something no couple wants to deal with; when you're baby has to go under the knife for ANY reason it's a nightmare for the parents.<br>  But you sound like you're doing a great job and I'm sure he'll be okay soon. Try to think about when he's an adult and you'll be telling him this story and his reaction to it. "Oh my god mom, you're kidding! That's so gross!"|`|qKnE08Rxaa	my gosh.... it must have been tough for you & your hubby, of course your baby too. My friend's baby had a heart surgery around 8 month because he had a hole in his heart. It was heart breaking to see a baby with all the things connected to him. My friend cried & cried.... just so much cry... It all went well. <br>  <br>  It seems like the surgery went well with your baby. Congratulations!! Hang in there. He'll recover soon & you'll forget how bad it was already. Your baby won't remember a thing so it's better having done early.|`|EsGrIscFaa	It's horrible to watch your baby go through something like this but be reassured that he is at an age where he will not remember anything of it. It'd be worse if he was 3 or 4 and scared himself. Just keep trooping through and following your doctors advice. It'll all be over in good time x
DyCd0fCFaa	Poor little guy!I have never went through anything like this or heard of it.I'm sorry he is in such discomfort and you as well.I hope everything is getting better!I would try using epsom salt in warm bath water if he's allowed a bath.Let him air out.The air will dry up the area-a bandage will keep moister in and can grow infection.I would keep up with the neosporin and ditch the antibiotics.Antibiotics are so over used.Especially in infants and young children.If he does develop an infection then by all means.Until then i don't recommend it.If he does get a serious infection the antibiotics prob wont work and he will continue to need stronger and differnt types of antibiotics.I would also go to a health food store and get probiotics!They will raise his antibodies and give him a chance to fight it on his own.Good luck to you hope he gets to feeling better.<br>  <br>  <br>  DON'T USE TALC OR BABY POWDER!!THIS SHOULD NEVER BE USED ON BABIES BECAUSE IT CAN CAUSE BREATHING DIFFICULTIES!!!!|`|1KIwM1uOaa	My daughter got a chunk of her ar bit off by a horse.  The doctors did surgery and reconstructed the ear with cartilage from behind the ear an a skin graft from her butt when she came out of surgery her ear looked awful and she also had the bandages on her bottom from the graft.  I didn't see how anything that looked that bad could look normal when it was healed but you know what it did.  Yes you can still see scarring but fo the most part you don't notice it.  Just do what the doctor says and it will be fine.  Kids heal faster than we do and you now what else it bothers us mor than it does tem too.|`|WWUvwtULaa	Genitals actually have a very quick healing time. Same with the anus/ rectum.<br>  <br>  This is why soreness after sex, blood after a hard stool, etc. doesn't last very long at all. Maybe a day or two max.<br>  <br>  Obviously recovering from a surgery will take more time but just make sure to keep it clean. If he is having diarrhea then you might just rinse him off in the sink or tub. I know it sounds like a pain, but it is the most hygienic.<br>  <br>  Also, keep the wound dry. You can use a talc powder or baby powder. This will reduce irritation. Try to limit soap usage.<br>  <br>  Remember, most boys in this country are circumcised and that is a big wound. Almost all of them heal fine with normal scarring.|`|2N4j1ficaa	hi hun i no its not nice to see your child hurt or in pain but he will be ok times a great healer its so true                 my son alex had open heart surgery at9 months and his chest is still pointing out lots but we have bin reassured it will with time go very much straighter and he was looking very swollen for quit a time after we came home ... <br>  good thing is in the genital area it dose heaL VERY FAST AND IN TIME YOU WONT EVEN NOT IS IT ... follow docs instructions and every ting shud be on anyway the antibiotics shud keep any infection at bay but if  he gets a temp or starts to get very weepy  just phone your docs am shore they will be happy to see him again|`|Cy9MmTzCaa	Don't worry it'll be fine. My younger sister had a few surgeries when she was an infant and we had very similar concerns about it getting infected from her poop and such, but it all worked out fine. I'm sure your son will be fine. Try to too stress about it too much :)
1SGl03Zlaa	For a regular umbrella stroller you should wait until the baby can sit up unsupported, but if he isn't sitting up on his own yet you could get a reclining umbrella stroller.|`|4JuwXJrEaa	You can use an umbrella stroller once baby can sit up unassisted.|`|SLph9RX6aa	he'll be fine in a cheap light stroller as long as the straps hold him in, my son was 41/2 months, guide lines are usually 6 months but use common sense|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I bought one at 7 months, because of all the snow in our area.  My son could have used it earlier though.

You have to develop some ambition and drive is all!|`|AA10097817	Picture yourself as the person you expect yourself to be. Your parents are done in the raising you department.

Whatever it is you must have an interest in it...do you expect to finish college and attain a job of some sort?  I think you might want to finid something that you are interested in and pursue a job...once you start at it, it's not that bad an idea...but it is crucial particularly in your case to choose something that truly motivates you...I wish you the best of luck...|`|yyIVrngcaa	CAN'T SAY ANYTHING OTHER THAN...LIFE ISN'T ALL FUN...<br>  you gotta act your age sooner or later and do what you gotta do.<br>  <br>  getting a job and having a schedule isn't hard..i work full time...lately ive been doing overtime because i really have to, my jobs been getting more stressful...being an adult is hard work, but its definitely better than being a child.<br>  good luck*|`|EcgzRGPwaa	Hey I was just like you, my parents never really made me do anything really, they pretty much just let me do what I want.  I got to stay home pretty much from school whenever I wanted, and I didn't have to work either because my parents paid for everything.  Anyways I'm trying to grow up myself, so I went and found a job.  Now I know what it feels like to work and pay for things yourself.  I'm also going to college too, and yeah you better start attending more seriously, you can't miss college too much.  If you don't have a job, I suggest you get one, and yeah just keep attending school.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	What I would say is try and find a career you really enjoy. No one can find the motivation to get up in the morning if their job is boring and staid and pointless. Look at attending college as the gateway to your perfect life...not something to do before you have to get a crappy job.<br>  Try to find the perfect career path and then shoot for it, set yourself goals and stick to them...you really don;t want to be a 30 year old drifter who is still unhappy and possibley living with her parents ;)<br>  Good luck x|`|DyCd0fCFaa	You just sound like a spoiled brat to me.If I had a free ride to college you bet your *** i would be there!You know what you're doing wrong and what you need to do to correct it.So do it!!!How old are you?If I was your parent I would beat your ***!|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well thats just life you have to deal with it
lD0VcAlpaa	Take him back to the ER, even if he's doing better--it's much better safe than sorry. As for the baby's doctor--I'd consider finding another one. I know that sounds harsh, but when it comes to babies--doctors know they're supposed to call back in a timely manner.|`|AA10615926	He may have Rotavirus.  Did it start with vomiting and then turn into diarrhea?  If so it will last about 5-7 days.  If you can't get him to drink fluids then you need to take him back.  How often is he having diarrhea?  Offer water and pedialyte with a medicine dropper.  Give 1 teaspoon every 15 min.  I hope he is better soon.|`|saBZQJMUaa	TAKE HIM TO THE ER IMMEDIATELY!

That's just wrong for a dr not to return calls.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Yeah,I would. And don't leave until they can do something for him,as in diagnose the problem.
EFOBeGu4aa	I used to ask what everyone wanted for dinner and would try to cook what they wanted.  I used to get upset when my son didn't want to eat mac N' cheese & fish sticks.  Now years later I find out he is allergic and that's why he complained.  I don't force anyone to eat anything they don't want but they have to eat something.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	in my house, i try to accomodate. my kids aren't picky, and they actually know better. if it is something they really don't like, its becuase they have never had it and i cooked it the first time. if they try it for me, and still don't like it , i make them ramon noodles.<br>  if it is something i make all the time and they are being difficult, they starve :0)|`|UYfqzCoMaa	My children know that they eat was is made or they don't eat at all.

They'd yell me for some time, until their anger subsided, or take it out on me via spanking.  If I still refused, they'd make me eat it anyway, under the threat of throwing my favorite toy in the garbage.<br>  <br>  I really like the "eat what you're served or starve" suggestion.  I can't imagine for the life of me why my parents wouldn't do that.  I know what some of you will say: because they love me and care about me.  Well, they sure did a poor job of showing it.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	I always love how people will say "Eat it or go hungry" when I know that if their kid said "I'll go hungry" they would not let that go at that.<br>  <br>  If you are going to make that threat, carry it through.<br>  <br>  I would not be particularly upset, but I'm not going to make anything else. If they are old enough to make their own, they can make their own. If not, they can go hungry till breakfast.|`|AXEqOEloaa	I don't get upset but my thing is you eat what is made or starve, eventually they get hungry enough and will eat what is prepared. I have no desire to be accommodating to everyone in my family, not everyone will like everything I make all the time.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	I only get upset if they say they want it and then change their mind.  The rule is eat it or wait until breakfast.<br>  <br>  farad.....eat or g hungry is not an empty threat here.

Congrats on the babe|`|FKf67HXaaa	I figured out I was pregnant because of my weight gain that was at 4 months, thats when I started showing a little, and now i am 30 weeks and i still fit into all my clothes and i wasn't the skinniest thing in the world to start off with. im 5'7 and my pre weight was 155.|`|Ui9EQkDUaa	OMG your soooooo lucky, don't stress about it enjoy the fact that you can wear the same clothes and you will spring back into them after your bubs is born|`|KNxs4PrZaa	perfectly normal, i wore most of my normal clothes until about 18 weeks.|`|McyBIwvlaa	I'm 24 weeks and I'm still wearing a lot of my cloths.......just that my jeans can't close but I got this thing from Motherhood to put over the zip and it just looks like i have a long cami under my shirt. I don't think you should worry to much unless ur doctor says something....cause I've only started gaining weight (11.5 lbs) because I really couldn't keep much food down for first 3 months and my ultrasound said my baby is (1 lbs 8oz). Since you're eating better than I personally think you're fine.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Yes it's pretty normal. At that stage I still just looked a bit bloated/pudgier than before but not pregnant, but I had gained a few pounds. If you have not gained, I would say it is normal for you to look the same. I didn't start showing until about 20 weeks. That's pretty common especially for first time moms.|`|TljXiSNnaa	i would say yes!!! im 16 weeks 2 days in the same clothes my clothes are even big on me seeming that i lost 12 pounds im 5'5 and pre pregnancy i was 156 and now in 142. i consider us lucky hun. the doc says my baby is fine i just have to get some test done on my thyroid to see if thats the problem but if it is its nothing major they say i would just have to eat a hell of a lot more lol!!!<br>  goodluck
iUzSlmSbaa	Your friend asked you how she should break it to her mom what happened to her.. .so your friend plans to tell her mom, I think as your mom knows a bit of the story, why can't she be your confidante. She is a mom, you are her daughter, she must care. You can trust her and she will support you. If you just take her aside and tell her.. Mom, can we talk about something, there is something on my mind that burdens me, I want to get it off my chest as my councellor is not there ... and if you fail to talk..show your mom what you wrote down.. there is nothing you need hide from her. Tell your mom! Talk to your friend also.. you are going through something similar.. you can be a comfort to each other..  she definitely has to talk to her mom, because in her case, this was even more than an assault... There should be no shame or secrecy this is not some dark dirty secret, this is some horrible traumatic event but this is not your fault and neither your mom nor anyone who cares about you, nor anyone ''normal'' will in any way believe that you are to blame in this.. so get it off your chest please.. I told you about Sylvie.. the girl who was 17 at the time it happened.. I told her what happened to her.. she told nobody for years because Sylvies dad left the family when Sylvie was 14 and he never visited again, he just left their lives.. she had an elder brother and after the husband left her mother who was in her 40's started dating guys in their 20's so for that reason Sylvie I guess felt she had nobody to turn to. Her mother was too busy with lovers half her age. The father had left and not told anyone where he would go.. never returned. So that abandonment by her dad at age 14 and the rape by the two guys at 17 was the reason why Sylvie  fell into deep depression..She should have gone for councelling right away. But she kept it to herself for years. and in her case it had a tragic ending.. from age 17 to age 39, 22 years in emotional pain passed with 11 failed suicide attempts.. and then I told you what she did.. she didn't tell her husband, went out as usual, on her way back jumped off the bridge into the icy water.. I looked down that bridge so many times.. I never knew Sylvie personally but I threw flowers in the river.. and I know she chose March because she would have survived the jump and survival instincts would have kicked in to swim as she was an excellent swimmer, but the icy cold.. numbed her right away.. she never stood a chance to move  in that water which still had ice on the top... it was witnessed by a policeman who called out to her.. so what happened and how it happened is known to her family and I was told it later by her widower... that's how I know and that's why it touched me as if I had known her really and I wanted to write about it.. just for myself.. for nobody else. I don' t want you to go on with emotional pain, talk to your mom or anyone you trust the most apart from your councellor.. A mom can be of emotional support. Once she knows this whole story, she will understand a lot better and she will do what she can to be there for you.. if you don't believe you can tell her, talk to somebody else you feel close to in your family.. and definitely urge your friend to tell her mom about what happened to her.. because in her case this was rape.. there is not much a mother cannot understand.. she will want to know.. she will make you feel that you share this.. if you share the story with her.. and your friend definitely should do the same to her mom... tell her all .. there is no guilt on your part. there is no guilt ever on a victims part.. you experienced a sexual assault that could have let to rape.. your friend was raped.. the councellor is necessary.. but family can help a lot in such a time.. Try it please.. or give her your notes and ask your mom to read them.. and tell her to just read and then you will talk to her.. xxx<br>  PS. you see how many people care? I added you as a contact of mine.. you can read my contact info and if you want to talk to me, just add me, my mom was a victim of rape and she told me her story.... x|`|AA11296427	You ask way to many questions about your counselor.

But my doctor just told my husband and I to have sex at least every other day, if not more, to improve the chances of becoming pregnant.

Good luck, it will happen, just be patient.
URbMCRFLaa	I don't know all about the cervix being high or low and all that but if you spotted about a week after ovulation that could be implantation bleeding IF you had unprotected sex during ovulation. CM sounds like when you're preg and I got headaches before I actually found out I was pregnant with my son. I'd say it sounds pretty likely you may be preggers! Good luck and take a test!

As long as his doctor isn't concerned with your son's weight gain then you shouldn't be either. He'll probably level off, too, when he becomes more mobile. Since 6 months Noah has only gained maybe 4 lbs. and he's 11 months old now.|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	My son was born at 9lbs even and he was 23lbs at 6months.  I think your daughter is fine.  She's just bigger than most 6 month olds.
4GwTDea1aa	Your 23rd  week will begin your 6th month<br>  23-27*6 Months<br>  28-31*7 Months<br>  32-35*8 Months<br>  36-40-9 Months<br>  Hope that helped <br>  Good Luck|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	It is confusing because a lunar month is 28 days or 4 weeks, but a calendar month is usually 30/31 days or 4.5 weeks.  If you go by lunar months you are actually pregnant for 10 months.  When you talk about weeks, it won't come out exactly to 9 calendar months.  Try not to worry about it.  You due date is just an estimate anyway.|`|r9epzkJVaa	This is exactly the reason why a pregnancy is really 40 weeks and not "9 months". When asked, tell them how many weeks you are. The way to determine the due date of a birth is to count back 3 months from your last period and add 7 days.|`|TyvyBOKDaa	try www.i-am-pregnant.com it tells you how many days you are,how many days you have to go till your due date.what month your in.|`|QSodlfMraa	<a href="http://www.amazingpregnancy.com/duedate/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazingpregnancy.com/duedate/...</a><br>  <br>  Timeline <br>  Week no. 7 Days Starting <br>  1 Wednesday, October 1st 2008 <br>  2 Wednesday, October 8th 2008 <br>  3 Wednesday, October 15th 2008 <br>  4 Wednesday, October 22nd 2008 <br>  5 Wednesday, October 29th 2008 <br>  6 Wednesday, November 5th 2008 <br>  7 Wednesday, November 12th 2008 <br>  8 Wednesday, November 19th 2008 <br>  9 Wednesday, November 26th 2008 <br>  10 Wednesday, December 3rd 2008 <br>  11 Wednesday, December 10th 2008 <br>  12 Wednesday, December 17th 2008 <br>  Start Of Second Trimester <br>  13 Wednesday, December 24th 2008 <br>  14 Wednesday, December 31st 2008 <br>  15 Wednesday, January 7th 2009 <br>  16 Wednesday, January 14th 2009 <br>  17 Wednesday, January 21st 2009 <br>  18 Wednesday, January 28th 2009 <br>  19 Wednesday, February 4th 2009 <br>  20 Wednesday, February 11th 2009 <br>  21 Wednesday, February 18th 2009 <br>  22 Wednesday, February 25th 2009 <br>  23 Wednesday, March 4th 2009 <br>  24 Wednesday, March 11th 2009 <br>  25 Wednesday, March 18th 2009 <br>  26 Wednesday, March 25th 2009 <br>  27 Wednesday, April 1st 2009 <br>  Start Of Third Trimester <br>  28 Wednesday, April 8th 2009 <br>  29 Wednesday, April 15th 2009 <br>  30 Wednesday, April 22nd 2009 <br>  31 Wednesday, April 29th 2009 <br>  32 Wednesday, May 6th 2009 <br>  33 Wednesday, May 13th 2009 <br>  34 Wednesday, May 20th 2009 <br>  35 Wednesday, May 27th 2009 <br>  36 Wednesday, June 3rd 2009 <br>  37 Wednesday, June 10th 2009 <br>  38 Wednesday, June 17th 2009 <br>  39 Wednesday, June 24th 2009 <br>  40 Wednesday, July 1st 2009|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Here you go, check out this website, it has a chart that breaks it all down: <a href="http://www.baby2see.com/pregnancylength.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.baby2see.com/pregnancylength....</a>
smsUZG4Iaa	you go to the hospital. the doctor puts you on suicide watch and a nurse has to be in arms reach for 72 hours or until the doctor releases you.. thats about it ..|`|vKEYa8aeaa	well the hospital will get the police involved and you will be put into a psychological ward.|`|tbeO3Lataa	First, they would stop the bleeding through pressure and, eventually, probably stitches.<br>  <br>  Then, the person would be admitted to the psychiatric ward and put on suicide watch. Routinely, they would have to stay there for 72 hours. <br>  <br>  Once they are released, it is generally up to them.
XhIYAH6Laa	I am also 12 weeks today...yay!! I have a belly (my pants don't fit in the waist) but most of it is really bloating....I have had it bad...Congrats!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I'm 15 weeks today but at 12 weeks I was already two weeks into wearing maternity pants. I have a lot of extra belly flub though so that's probably why.<br>  <br>  12 weeks is way too early to feel the baby. My doctor said that since this is my second (as is yours) I may possibly feel the baby at 16 weeks. With my first I felt her move at 18 so I'm thinking the doc is probably right but you probably have a few more weeks to go before you feel the baby.|`|AA11609300	Congrats on making it to the second trimester!  =)<br>  I am 11 weeks and I do have a little belly.  Anyone that knows me can tell I am prego.  But, as I'm sure you know, everyone and every pregnancy is different.<br>  Also, my doctor told me the earliest you can feel the baby is usually at 16 weeks.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|AA11426077	not usually at 12 weeks. thats too early to be feeling kicks. its usually around the 5th month... around 20 weeks. you will get the belly soon enough. it depends on your body. my friend who was very very skinny has a little belly at 3 months, but my friend who was just average size didnt have a belly till 5 months.|`|v0aKxF6iaa	I'm just starting to get a belly im 16 weeks 6 days pregnant and im sure most people still think im just bloated or something not pregnant. this is my second pregnancy as well and this time i felt movements around 15 weeks|`|AHRLXm1maa	CONGRATS!!!!!! I am in my 12th week as well, and yes I am certainly showing. I am rather petite though, and my doctor said every woman is different! :)
AA11920812	As an Ohio State fan, if my children ever donned blue and gold and started rooting for Michigan...<br>  <br>  ...it`d be instant and quick punishment. If I didn`t die of heart failure first!<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  Maize?! WTF? Isn`t that cornmeal? That is way more girlie than gold! lmao. Can`t beat the classic scarlet and gray!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I am not really into sports except for NASCAR so for me it would be if they started rooting for Tony Steward, he is such a mean person and I just don't like him. For my husband, he loves baseball and is a huge Yankee's fan, so obviously it would be if they started rooting for the Red Sox! I got that it was a joke. Some people just have no sense of humor these days!!!|`|QveBSjFSaa	Funny, we are from California, and I am a Seahawks fan, my husband is a Steelers fan.<br>  No, Superbowl XL was not a warzone for us, as we both have respect for the other's teams.<br>  BUT the breaking point for us, CA natives and all, would be if our children endorsed  any of the CA teams~!<br>  Oh, and the Cowboys.<br>  America's team, my foot!|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	HaHa! I did this to my dad. I was raised to bleed maize and blue. However, I got a scholarship to MSU. So, I went there and graduated from there. I now bleed green and white. My two favorite teams are: MSU and whoever is playing U of M! LOL<br>  <br>  Also, what are the two things you get from Ann Arbor?<br>  <br>  1. Year after year the most overrated football team in the country.<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  2. Ugly chicks!!<br>  <br>  Go GREEN!|`|JT4OSUPeaa	OH man, my fiance is a die-hard TX Longhorn fan, he swears Colten is going to be the starting QB on the football team when he goes to college, he says its because our son is such a FLIRT! I think he would have a heartattack if our son was an....ugh....Aggie!!!<br>  <br>  His going home outfit was a little gray outfit with Bevo (there mascot) on it. Since he was born in September (football season).|`|lr9E8IC5aa	I live in Ohio (born and raised) Everyone around me are HUGE OSU fans (I hate OSU) and I'm a big time Notre Dame fan. <br>  <br>  Grounds for disowing..no.<br>  <br>  GO IRISH!!!!!!!|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Definitely disown them!  Put them out till they learn their lesson then MAYBE they can come back :P  You gotta realize (like i did soon after i came here) people have NO sense of humor on here.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	a little friendly compitition does no harm, but its not worth dis-owning them. duh.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	A very good friend of mine was a Michigan fan and I used to go to the bars with her and she HATED anyone rooting for Ohio State.  She was single and there was this totally cute guy and she said that it would never work because they are "too different" in their taste for college football teams.  So, I feel your pain and although I do not feel the same way about college football and my sons team choice- I would be VERY upset if he chose Coke over Pepsi.  Now that is grounds for disowning. =)|`|7aCH91ISaa	I would love them anyway... I am a Michigan Fan and my hubby is a die hard Ohio State fan. <br>  <br>  If I can deal with this from my hubby,  I guess I can put up with it if my children decide to lower their standards.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Lol!  <br>  <br>  This reminds me of my nephew.  I'm a Packer fan and I also married one.  My entire family is Cowboy fans.  My brother, the biggest Cowboy fan there is, just lost his son to my husband.  He has converted him to a Packer fan.  You should see my brother shopping for his son at Christmas and buying him everything in green and yellow; it is hilarious!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  If my boys wanted to be Sooners, we would have to talk.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Being a UT alumni I don't know what I would do if my daughter came home and said she wanted to be an Aggie. <br>  I would probably cry and feel as though I failed to teach her common sense. I wouldn't stop praying for her but I wouldn't visit her dorm, and if I did- I would probably just egg it.|`|ygimTNzoaa	I wouldn't care what team my kid go's for. I was born and raised in Northern California, my dad and brother were strong for 49'ers (yuck), and when I was maybe 5 or 6 I remember seeing the Cowboys playing the 49'ers, I picked Cowboys as my team and I have nothing to do with Texas! I'm still 100% for the Cowboys, my dad and brother made fun of me but they accepted it. I now live in Cincinnati Ohio, been here for 5 months and my fiance is of course for the stupid Bangles. That's him, and I'm me. I'm 5 months pregnant and my kid can like whoever she wants to like.|`|sxecXFgraa	My mom went through this.  My mom and I are both huge Alabama fans.  My youngest brother (an Auburn fan) and I both went to Auburn.  My mom was heartbroken when we got the acceptance letters but when she saw what we were getting in scholarships, that mended her heart a little.  <br>  <br>  She did have a shirt made that said "My kids and money may go to Auburn but my heart and sole goes to Bama!"<br>  <br>  Now, my kids like to torture me and say War Eagle all the time, especially when my brothers are around, and I do feel like putting duct tape on their mouth.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Considering I'm a 'Skin's fan, if either of them started like the Cowboys - they would be done.  They better never show their face in my living room again during football season.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	Ah, so this explained how people get  "twice removed" from the family LOL! <br>  <br>  Good thing my daughter has me, or she'd be on the streets. My husband's a big Boston fan and my daughter, Bailee, supports New York just too push his buttons. Obviously it gets very competitive in this house during baseball season. Yikes!  But no, I wouldn't disown her for JUST that(:<br>  <br>  Jeez, who sucked the humor out of all these people?
vue9NOhYaa	Well, neither of the ones you already have is a 'good debate point' .. since 'good debate points' are based on facts, and not personal opinions.  <br>  <br>  But ... let's see ... "Abortion should not be permitted because our jails aren't full enough, and we need to be incarcerating thousands of desperate young women who WILL have abortions whether it's legal or not."|`|cj7sSPZEaa	How about the fact that they have to rip the baby into pieces to get it out?|`|9ae55890a5fcfea5236690724138dc1faa	Abortion is being used as a form of contraception. That is wrong.<br>  By 9 or 10 weeks the Foetus fundamentally resembles a human.<br>  The legal abortion limit (24 weeks where I live) is far too high. There have been 20 week old foetus's born early which survived. This shows that even at that stage the foetus is developed.<br>  Those are just reasons for limiting abortions though which is all I actually believe in, what about the child of rape victims or a child with severe disablilitys. Dont you think they should be aborted? How about preventing a hereditory disease from being passed on? Then there is the fact that if it wasn't legal thousands of women would have it done ilegally and it would much less safely.<br>  <br>  The major arguements for banning it altogether are usually opinions like<br>  a) You are taking a life (or potential life) which is as bad as murder<br>  b) life begins at conception<br>  but there are also facts like unwanted children could go into the adoption system where there are more people wanting to be parents than there are children.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	well, i think the killing/murder point is valid and it takes more than one person to do the joint killing/murdering....the mother, the father, the parents of the pregnant mother, the friend or whomever encourages the decision to abort, the receptionist in the abortion clinic, the administrator and doctor and all of the staff right down to the people that come in to clean the facility or mows the grass around the murderous place.      it's a den of murderers<br>  <br>  and the government aids this murder and no one goes to prison for it.  it's amazing amazing amazing|`|3URupc7caa	because my unborn baby is alive..she has hair, finger prints, toe nails/finger nails..she can hear and feel my touch..she can swallow, make facial expressions and kick!! she is only 17 weeks old and she can already do and has all of this! Enough said!|`|zj91sSsuaa	Well I guess if you can go to jail for destroying rare fertilized turtle eggs then you should go to jail for destroying fertilized human eggs within the womb.|`|BBHySbawaa	I believe that abortion is completely wrong. Killing/murder is a good debate point, but there's more to it. If someone has unprotected sex, or something else, and gets pregnant, it is totally not the baby's (or fetus's) fault they got pregnant. It's not fair to the life that could develop that the parents were just not being responsible and didn't try to not have a child. If someone ends up pregnant, they should take the consequences. A great alternative to abortion is adoption after giving birth.<br>  <br>  My opinion! Hope it helps! :-)
smsUZG4Iaa	if sperm was released or pre-ejaculation got on his hand. yes you could possibly get pregnant|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Yup, it's possible.|`|v5XYluuFaa	It is possible, but doesn't happen often. Don't take the chance; make sure he washes his hands.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	you get pregnant by sperm meeting egg.<br>  <br>  however that is done<br>  <br>  tell him to just play with himself at home, not before he touches you !|`|Heyz3xp9aa	it is possible, it depends on how much semen was on his hand , it is unlikely for this to happen|`|7RH1WmWOaa	Yes and you can get STDs as well..
igvUbqkyaa	I don't really care for the whole 2 middle name thing but I like:<br>  Luke - love this as a nickname to Lucas<br>  Alexander - great strong name - love it<br>  Tyler - cute but a bit overused<br>  Carter - cool but wouldn't personally use it<br>  <br>  Hailey - cute and I also like the spelling Haley - a bit childish though<br>  Elizabeth - LOVE this name although I do prefer the spelling Elisabeth but both are gorgeous!<br>  Rose - love this and a great middle name<br>  <br>  My favorites are definitely Luke Neil-Alexander but I think just Luke Alexander is best or Lucas Alexander or Alexander Lucas (my favorite)! Of the girl options, I really love Hailey Elizabeth Rose!!! I personally would use Elizabeth as the first name though and use Elizabeth Hailey Rose or Elizabeth Rose or Elisabeth Rose (my favorite).<br>  <br>  Nice Choices!<br>  <br>  Oh, and I would stick with the classic spelling of Saoirse.|`|lqLzULXEaa	I think thery are all very cute names for ?BOYS? i like Jordan Anden and for ?GIRLS? I like Hailey Elizabeth Rose|`|edLbogmYaa	Why are you thinking about baby names at he age of 12? Kind jumping the gun aren't you? But anyway Luke Neil is a very nice name! But Saoirse is ugly and terriable!

v8XK80Ycaa	MY BABY IS 8 MONTHS.<br>  She has a small baby sized bowl of porridge or weetabix in the morning (8am) followed by a 7oz bottle of sma blue.<br>  Then i'll give her tiny pieces of my soft toast when i have my breakfast around 10am<br>  She'll then have a rusk for a snack to keep her going until 12pm. For dinner I usually give her my homemade stew (soft potatoes, carrots, soup mix, sprouts etc) or a whole jar of baby food, followed by another 7oz bottle<br>  I do offer rusks or water biscuits throughout the day and she'll eat them if she's hungry<br>  She''ll often nab our dinner at night (she like everything!), but for hers she'll have mash potato (homemade), vegatables etc or baby food followed again by another bottle. Then a 5oz top up feed before bed usually around 8pm. <br>  Every baby is different but mine enjoys lots of variety and as long as its soft enough and in small pieces she has most things off our plates aswell!<br>  i know 7oz seems alot after her food but usually she'll drink aroun5-6 but i'd rather make her extra just incase!<br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|AA11025762	my boy wasnt eating much at 9 months.. wasnt until about a year he got into the 3 meals a day plus snacks routine.<br>  <br>  he should have a good breckfast and lunch and a snack at tea time, with about 3-4 bottles a day maybe, whatever suits him personally.|`|Ov9qM1gdaa	I find that food is always a good choice to feed a child. You can't go wrong with it.|`|gmmGchcuaa	Steak and chips.|`|LvbizUcwaa	I'd have to say cereal in the morning when he gets up then when he gets hungry again a bottle prob 6 ounces then around lunch time baby solid food then before his afternoon nap or when hungry again another 6 ounce bottle then supper more solid baby food then another 6 ounce bottle when hes hungry again or right before bedtime!!!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	If he's good with food and eager to feed himself you can really go nuts at nine months.  Steamed veggies, pieces of soft or baked fruit, shredded chicken, rice, beans, pretty much anything you eat, with sensible alterations for baby.|`|U3jS5k9eaa	Hi. At 9 months my little boy was eating 3 meals a day. Breakfast was porridge and a piece of fruit, lunch and tea was homemade food which i freeze and bits of finger food such as cheese, wotsits, carrot sticks etc. As soon as he started solids he started to push away his milk so was only drinking 10 oz of milk a day and that was through the<br>  night.
X2I9Mu4Vaa	ugh! my son is the SAME WAY. and it was weird, when he was around 10 or 11 months he was doing really good with no .. but all of a sudden he seems to have forgot everything ive taught him. he constantly goes to the trash can, any wires, outlets (he learned how to take the safety things out so now he likes to play with them more) its like ugh its exhausting. i thought this was supposed to wait until the terrible twos .. sometimes i think he thinks like stewie from family guy, you know, how he hates lois .. haha<br>  <br>  he will be 13 months on the 16th of march and i swear he gets more testy everyday!|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	Welcome to motherhood!!!!  You wouldn't be a human being if you didn't get stressed at your kids at one time or another, and I wish I could tell you that it will all be okay but as they get older the stresses and worries just get different, I should know my 3 are 10, 7 and 3<br>  <br>  Kids will find anything that they can be mischevious with, if it wasn't a computer chair it would be something else!  You can't wrap him up in cotton wool, nor can you take everything away, as long as you are supervising him he will only have minor bumps.|`|A3HObJUeaa	I really do understand how you feel. I have a 2 year old and an (almost) 11 month old and they drive me crazy sometimes getting into so much trouble. At 9 months your son is not only just exploring and trying new things, but remember, he's also testing you. It's best at this point to just consistantly say no, but also only say no when it's something that is serious (something that might hurt him)|`|EsGrIscFaa	I found this the hardest period but I don't think a baby can understand the word no until at least a year old. You just have to keep removing things or them away from things. It's horrid because they have no fear of things that you know will hurt!|`|heDtLdz5aa	its just part of being a mom..and i moved my coffee table out of the living room so we wouldn't have as many accidents..try putting up some baby gates or a play yard in your living room..|`|MvMMIxjIaa	lol isint it great!!!! i have 3 children one more mischievous than the other, have u tried putting him in a play pen so he's safe and u can get some work done. its completely natural t get stressed i find the best thing to do if possible i wrap him up put him in he buggy go for a walk fresh air is great for him tire him out. Dont try to rush around let him explore when u have the time to supervise him and play with him, honestly it does u good too!!!  Its just a matter of realising thats his job to explore he's not being bad u need to adapt to it and slow ure life down it gets better wait till u have a teenager  lol|`|AA11134717	yes! my baby girl is walking and shell go up to something and if i tell her no she just does it a little faster and then laugh.it gets worse when they start to walk                      good luck|`|hv2nmmrqaa	Yeah it can be stressful but just thank the heavens that your not the dad who has to listen to how stressed you are all the time :P|`|AA11182621	Well he is testing the boundaries and you are giving in by your behaviour towards him.Children will do this throughout their lives, well into their teens<br>  <br>  If you say no he must stop, if he throws a tantrum then put him o the naughty cushion. Get a big beanbag or something and make him sit there. Don not give in, don't loose your temper, just be assertive not aggressive. Do not hit him either. Just in a firm tone that you mean it. If he is good reward him wit a treat.<br>  <br>  You have to have patience. Play with him, get him engaged in puzzle solving. Start him off, give him the task and reward him if he has done well. If he has not that is not important either. Just encourage him when he is good and make sure he knows that you are the Boss|`|bf80NxKzaa	My mum used to put my sisters (twins) in playpens when they were babies with all their toys and a pillow!  If your child is used to running about then they probably won't like this and will cry but my mum was of the school of thought that says if your child cries because they want to do something you don't want them to do, just ignore them.  That's hard as hell to do!  But my sisters are now both very nice, capable, intelligent, creative, successful women.<br>  <br>  When it came to my little brother, however, nothing could keep him from getting in everything or climbing out of anything he was put in!  He used to go around the house taking things apart - like the record player and the TV for example! He's a successful engineer now who's a wizz at anything technical!

All of them, sorry|`|AA11569882	I know a little girl called Annelies (Anna-leese) and I think it's a beautiful name, adding an extra 'a' on the end might be a bit much.  But I think the names are lovely, my top three are Victoria Annalise, Alanna Grace, and Allison Rebecca.  Good luck!|`|7HxJvbjMaa	Most of those names have too many syllables. If you have 3 syllables in the first name you should only have one or 2 in the middle name.<br>  For that reason I will choose Alannah Grace and Naomi Blaire as my favorites.|`|3ec2dc9c564affe4311fe2b01585ad71aa	blaire naomi <br>  victoria annalise<br>  catrina lillian<br>  =)|`|XbzXOI4Xaa	Naomi Claire Doherty<br>  <br>  but isnt there someone lese with that same last name having twin boys? hmmm|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I love Alannah Grace!!!!!!

Ojgqd4xNaa	I purchased the hospital ones, then got my little girls pictures done professionally at 6 weeks, and 4 months.  And I plan to get them around 6, 9, and 12.  I don't wanna miss a thing.  I also try to buy only a few, but they do come out so cute!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Never.  We have a bunch of photo gear and we're around when he's doing all the cute stuff anyway.|`|MtOSX19Haa	I have three kids and we had pictures made with the first at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year.  After that on her 2nd and 3rd birthday.  Same thing done when the 2nd child was born.  Now we have three and already have an appointment set for May when he is 3 months old.  We just don't buy big packages because we really don't have that many people to give pictures to.  We get a large 8x10 for us and smaller 5x7's for the grandparents and then a sheet of wallets for myself and my husband.|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	I got my son's pics done once professionally and it was really expensive....too expensive if you ask me.  Haha...he was 2 months....I like the snap shots I take of him....they're more natural to me.|`|B1OUPWxXaa	When i was little my parents never did that, they're good photographers.|`|EeGgovyCaa	we've only done them once since they were born and they are now 15 months.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	If you have a very good camera, you don't need a professional photographer to take pictures for your baby. My hubby's a designer so he has to own a good quality camera so we have many great photos. Those are better than professionally taken because baby looks so natural.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to have some good quality pictures then, invest on getting a really decent camera. If not, professionally taken pictures should work too. Baby grows so fast that you don't want to miss this precious time!!   Or if you have a friend who has a good camera, ask them to take pictures of your baby. I like pictures taken in daily life, not in a studio.|`|VCCKfT3taa	I've actually never gotten it done. My friends all think I'm crazy though, if that's any consolation to you. My best friend asked me where the "hospital pictures" were, and I found out she meant the 200 dollar package of photos the hospital offered right after birth that I turned down. <br>  She was like, "OMG WHY?"<br>  <br>  And I was like, "omg... 200 dollars?"|`|z6IekuwSaa	I am just doing every holiday the cheesy walmart/sears stuff. And then the real nice professional stuff when she was born and then I'm going to do it every six months.|`|jvFWNuiXaa	we had the picture taken at 1 week. We r planning to do it when he s 3 months and on his birthdays. I would like to have one at 6 months too. That would be nice.|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	When my daughter was first born we got them done like every 6 months cause they change so much. Now we're starting to do them every year....It gets a bit expensive!|`|t9S0dqfLaa	I don't see anything wrong with that, if I could afford it I would do the same thing.|`|AA11134717	OMG! yoy dont get them done too much i do. i have my babys pics done atlest one everymonth
b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	very intersting article! Im at work so I didnt read ALL of it yet but i printed it so I will read it at home tonight! Thanks for sharing! <br>  <br>  I had been trying for 13 months...i lost 5 pounds and got pregnant. I had a miscarriage but the weight loss was the only different thing that changed that month i conceived!|`|jBIaUfUzaa	oh i believe it i know i cant get pregnant or hold a pregnancy because of my weight|`|iO3BLRTYaa	it's supposed to have something to do with it yes, as if you're body's having a hard time of trying to keep u healthy, it'll have to work twice as hard to keep a baby healthy AND you too!<br>  <br>  5 a day, and vitamins.
bmoCpcdraa	that is what elvis named his daughter, very famous name,,,,,,|`|Elxuvon8aa	It is a nice name but made very popular by Elvis Presley|`|UjFfdquLaa	I actually like it :)|`|igvUbqkyaa	I think Lisa is cute but as a nickname to Elisabeth. I am not a huge fan of Marie though. And all I can think of is Lisa Marie Presley.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	My first thought is: Lisa Marie Presley.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's a famous name Lisa Marie...I like em separate not together.|`|nAOlBmzDaa	Lisa Marie Presley? Like Elvis's daughter???|`|QmFfeSslaa	I think Lisa and Marie are cute for middle names, but I am not crazy about the shortness of Lisa, especially put with Marie.<br>  <br>  But they are not bad names, just kind of boring.|`|bXF1gDTcaa	its simple. its okay, kinda common. you can't help what you're named though. it's classic.|`|pl7lWGZDaa	It just reminds me of Lisa Marie Presley. I don't like the name Lisa, personally.|`|KNX2sKr7aa	I like it, like Lisa Marie Presley.  So Elvis liked it too :-)|`|AA10826403	I don't like the name Lisa Marie.|`|DwkUUQqhaa	Yes, it's pretty.<br>  <br>  Have a wonderful day. <3|`|doHNEvf8aa	its a little plain, but its still pretty|`|BCIfeHAqaa	Yeahh, i do.<br>  Its a little...ordinary.<br>  But it's still pretty.|`|LABYN2vOaa	I think it's a very beautiful name, despite simplicity. :)<br>  <br>  You might already know this; but since I'm into name meanings, I thought I'd share it with you anyhow - Lisa is a form of Elisabeth, and would mean: "my God is an oath" or perhaps "my God is abundance".<br>  <br>  ...with Marie being a form of Mary, and the meaning is not certain, but there have been a few suggestions: "sea of bitterness", "rebelliousness", and "wished for child". However it was most likely originally an Egyptian name, perhaps derived in part from mry "beloved" or mr "love".<br>  <br>  Those are two very nice names, and your cousin should be happy with her name; because it is beautiful. :)|`|Evj52OTwaa	Yeah thats adorable<br>  its an old fashion name but its still cute<br>  old fashion names are kool<br>  my name is Julie Ann.|`|P9RlLQH4aa	I do like it, but I also find that name is very common.|`|c8f8978bfae705ec30c276472d60b840aa	Hehe I like it, it's so simple
b9RunHVYaa	It can be.<br>  But it is never a positive indicator.<br>  If you are carrying low, it is said that you are going to have a boy.<br>  Another one that I've heard is; if you don't really look pregnant from behind, you could be carrying a boy.<br>  But, like I said, never a positive indicator.<br>  Everyone's body is different! :)|`|2V4JHa1Saa	not true i carried so low with my first that i thought she was going to just rush out any moment and she was a girl and then i was pregnant with boy girl twins and they would switch spots one up high one day the next the one that was high went low|`|AA11783671	It is just an old wives tale, but was true for me.  My daughter was under my ribs and my son felt like he was half hanging out down below!|`|EmhBDHMtaa	well i'm having a boy and I'm carrying low..it seems to be true from everyone that I've seen pregnant.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	No.  It's just an old wives' tale.  It will be true about half the time, of course.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No. I carried low with my girl. That's just an old wives tale.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	I carried the same way with both my son and all of my daughters.  there was never a difference.  Although, that's not to say that it doesn't happen to some people.  It really has nothing to do with it.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Everyone is different, but in my family we carry boys low. Everyone guessed a boy for me, and thats what it is!|`|k2heQRKFaa	no everyone is different ... think about it how could the sex organs cause u to carry baby a certain way....sounds dumb doesnt it|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	50/50 chance that if you are carrying low it might be a girl|`|3K7ffKn2aa	nope not true at all. my family kept saying i was going to have a boy but my doc confirmed at 21 weeks that it was a girl (just like i had been saying it would be)|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	I've had 3 girls which I carried high and a boy which I carried low and I'm carrying low again and knew before the ultrasound that it was a boy and I was right.|`|yPNvecc7aa	No. <br>  And I'm proof; Everyone keeps saying "Oh I bet you're having a girl!" and I'm having a boy. I have the picture of his pipi to prove it. lol|`|gUhcMAutaa	this is a theory, its not proven. however i believe it is true and your statement above sounds correct.|`|J3yUXKiyaa	Nope.  Not true.  It has more to do with your body shape, your musculature, how fit you are, etc.|`|TxYcs9H9aa	I'm carrying very high and I'm having a boy, so for me there's no truth to it.|`|MXVrsn1Oaa	I carried high until my baby dropped and im having a boy|`|v0aKxF6iaa	its a myth.
lC7oWudPaa	then also try to give formula one time formula and then breastfeeding, u wont too much exhaust this way|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	What you should do is call your dr and discuss this with them. They know what meds can be taken and which may be harmful to the baby.<br>  <br>  I find it hard to believe that your dr wants you stop your psychiatric meds, but if that is the case, call and ask any pharmacist what you can take to slep better|`|ic2B0y7zaa	I can relate! I was on pills for anxiety and depression before pregnancy. And when im having a bad day I my daughter to bed and make myself a cup of Chamomile Tea. It also helps to write in a journal about your days. Hope this helps.<br>  Also at night if I was really tired I would give her a bottle of formula, it would make her sleep a little bit longer.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	You need to talk to your doctor again. It could be a simple stress after a baby but it maybe a very serious problem - post partum depression which requires you to take medication. My friend has a problem but with all the support from family & med. from doctor helped her to get through. <br>  <br>  You can breastfeed with medications approved by doctor so talk to your doctor that you really need something to sleep.
os36Q3P2aa	hiya <br>  <br>  my 1st was on time,2nd induced,3rd went into labour on induction day ! 4th  emergency section  at 36weeks <br>  <br>  They are all so different..i must admit  when i was pregnant with all of mine ..the idea of going over due   wasnt a good one lol im sooo impatient !!! i would of been pulling my hair out   i think <br>  <br>  Best of luck <br>  xxx|`|hVVALFAPaa	Sorry, you probably don't want to hear my answer, but...<br>  <br>  I went to 42 weeks with all 4 of my kids. All of them were induced, but some inductions were easier than others (the second and fourth were smooth but not quick. Even with my 4th, I was in labor for 10 hours.<br>  <br>  I guess it is a trend with some mommies!|`|oAyOEkQYaa	I too was at 39 weeks with my eldest, but my twins who followed 9 months later came at 31 weeks, my 4th child (third pregnancy) was at 41 weeks and for my last baby I was at 43 weeks before I was induced.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	good luck I only have one son biologically but I have three more step children but my son was exactly to the day 10 months|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	I was really lucky, my eldest was born on his due date, my middle child came at 39 wks and my daughter at 40.  <br>  <br>  It's times like these you wish you had a crystal ball!|`|ea688e0ee7ebc6fe5eaaffcf5e7e80e2aa	Unfortunately babies come when they are ready!

Had both my fourth and my fifth baby four weeks early.  My friend just had her third baby two days ago and she was 11 days past her due date!<br>  I don't think it has anything to do with baby #.  I think it more has to do with our individual bodies.|`|AA11510511	My wife went 2 weeks over on 1st, 3 days over on 2nd and a week over on 3rd.  We are expecting our 4th on the 1st June, and I hope she will go early  for a change lol.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	My youngest daughter was born the day before her due date, the oldest was two months premature and the middle one was one day after her due date.  My mother gave birth to 7 children and only one of them was really late and it was her third child.  My youngest brother was a week late the third one was almost a month late.  I was her fifth child and I was 6 weeks early. So a lot depends on the child and the mother.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I had my first 3 days early. I had my son a week and a half early, and I had our last 2 weeks early. So I don't know what it's like to go the full 40 weeks. Good luck and congrats!|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I was induced with my oldest 5 days early, my middle child was born 5 days early also and my youngest was a week early.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	My first was 18 days early, my second one was one day early and my third was born on his due date.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	That depends on where you live.<br>  <br>  But frankly its inhumane to separate moms and babies, period.  There is no reason to take them out of your sight to weigh them or whatever dumb excuse they are using now.<br>  <br>  Generally you can leave about 3-4 hours after birth if you choose.|`|MtOSX19Haa	A lot depends on the hospital.  I had no complications with my son's birth.  He was born at 11:40 a.m.  I held him for a minute before they took him to get cleaned up.  Then after a few minutes they wrapped him up and gave him to me to feed.  Then a little while later the nurses came to give him his bath and do a hearing test.  After that he never left my room.  It was hospital policy for him to stay in the hospital for 24 hours.  So we were discharged the next day at around noon.  Hope this helps and good luck.  You could also call your hospital/birthing center and see what there policy is in your area.|`|EsGrIscFaa	My daughter was placed on my stomach immediately. She stayed with me throughout the afterbirth and all that jazz, then she was taken by the midwife to be cleaned up and weighed, at which point I had a shower and got changed. After that she was back in my arms again and we went home after two nights stay in hospital. She slept in a crib next to me all that time and I held he whenever she or I wanted.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I held my baby right away then they ran her tests and weighed her. Then I got her back. At the hospital I was at, you had a choice to either keep your baby in your room with you or you could send them to the nursery. I kept her with me at all times. I delivered at 2:25pm Thursday and went home around 2pm saturday afternoon. If you have to have a c-section I think you have to stay a few days longer but not sure how long. Good luck!|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	As soon as my son popped out they handed him 2 me before his cord was even cut. I held him a few mins they they weighed and measured and handed him back. After about 30 mins or so they carried him down and gave him a bath and all. I had complications so I didn't see him again for a few hrs. Good luck and congrats!|`|k2heQRKFaa	I think it depends.. I had mybaby at 39 weeks but the cord was around the neck.. so they had to check her out. I got to hold her like an hour later...Im sure it differs with each baby and the circumstances. BUt i think if its all good normal no complications vaginal birth you can hold baby right away..|`|nmu6coapaa	I didn't even get to hold my wee man right away, he was taken straight to NICU and I didn't get to hold him for another 3 days! It was so difficult! We were 9 days in hospital altogether!|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Right away you will be able to hold the baby and then you may be able to go home within a day since it is your second|`|1VdgsZPoaa	There were no complications with my daughter and they let me hold her for 2 or 3 minutes, cleaned her up right next to me in the room, wrapped her in a blanket, and then gave her back to me.  I was home within 3 days.  She was born at 38 weeks and 2 days though, so she was healthy.|`|wP0AjcQ1aa	After my C section they took my son to NICU too because I had a fever and from him being in me he had one as well. I didn't get to hold or see him until about 2 hours later. <br>  I had him on a monday and we both went home that saturday.|`|KYkoPHpsaa	I dont even remember holding my baby because I was too drugged up from my csection... but apparently there were pics of me holding her few minutes after birth, and then i went home 3 days later and held her lots lots lots in those 3 days and still :)|`|72SrLDQ3aa	It really depends on the hospital.<br>  I got to hold my daughters for a few seconds after they were born, but I didn't really get to hold them until about an hour later after they brought them back from all the tests and their first baths.<br>  Most hospitals require mother & baby to stay for 48 hours if both are healthy, but some only require you both to stay for 24 hours.|`|IkkYOehSaa	with my first child I got to hole her right away and then they took her to get weighed and cleaned and all. The second baby had complications so I only got to hold him for like 30 seconds then they took him. But whit my third child and I different hospital they gave me my baby and I had her for an hour or more before they came to weigh her and clean her up. I loved it and was so surprised. I was afraid to say anything for fear they would realize they made a mistake. lol But that's what their procedure was. And truthfully, is her weight going to change much in one hour. But I got to nurse her for the first time and hold her, and love her. It was the best thing.<br>  <br>  We went home two days later with each child.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	If there are no complications you can hold your baby for a few minutes. Then they usually take then, clean them up, check them over and give them right back to you. That is unless you want to hold your baby even longer before they do the clean up... You and baby can leave the hospital 1-3 days later depending on when your doctor releases you and the baby. =)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	my son was put on my belly right away i held him for a couple minutes and then they took him to get weighed. after that he stayed with me and we left 32 hours later<br>   my son was a 36 weeker but he was fine- alsp had cord around his neck which happend in 1 out of every 3 babies- not problems. they wanted me to stay another day but i wanted to leave earlier|`|4e67Pdfvaa	I held them for 1 min as the whole afterbirth thing went down, then they took the baby to be tested and weighed.

RnB6D6ZYaa	Please stop giving him whiskey to drink.|`|flqAr30laa	why not get him a baby walker?|`|VmLZFN4Taa	That's unfortunate..|`|4lHJEq5Haa	lol oh lordy, I hear ya. My daughter is 9 months old too and trying to walk. I follow her as carefully as I can, but she's gotten some pretty good bumps on the head! If your son is crying a lot but seems to brush it off pretty quickly, don't worry. If you notice him acting strangely, or is bleeding or something like that, take him to the doctor. Unfortunately, this is just a preview of the toddler years.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	well you get what you pay for right? as far as free childcare goes anyway. there's nothing you can do. he's 9 mos. they fall. but it would bother me because he is in someone else's care. i don't care if she is his grandmother. see how she would feel if you suggest that maybe you are thinking of looking for a daycare situation. if her response is disappointment then you know she enjoys having him. but if she agrees that that might be best for tristan, then i would look into finding alternative childcare.<br>  <br>  Edit - no, just knowlegable. yes these things can happen at a daycare (which is why i stay at home) - but when i did work, at least if something happened at a daycare, i could hold them responsible. they have more to lose (financially speaking). sorry you have to work.|`|sKYmvXW7aa	it's inevitable, little kids are going to fall, it's part of the process of learning to walk on their own.

Don't worry my son was the same way. I used to be so worried that he was gonna have brain damage but he's fine. He's silly but fine..lol. H'es 26 months now. He's almost potty trained, knows most of his abc's, and can count to 12 so your good.|`|DyCd0fCFaa	As long as the bump goes out and not in you should be ok.Watch for a tired baby and make sure his eyes are as usual.This happens a lot and is normal however:<br>  <br>  My horror story:<br>  <br>  At 14 months my daughter was pushed of a stack of clothing that needed washed.She hit her head on ceramic tile.She cried of course but for the most part looked ok.That night she had a fever of 104 and I called the dr.We thought it was unrelated until---She has 105 for the next 6 days.She was unable to sustain her own body temp.After the 7th day she was back to normal-Very scary but also VERY UNLIKELY!!<br>  <br>  I'm sure he's find and will be..take him to the dr if your still nervous but if he acts normal he prob is.
d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	LOL...YES!<br>  <br>  The brand I use is decent enough to where I can actually go a day without reapplying...even after a shower. So I know I'm safe if I forget every now and then.  Other incidents:  backwards shirst; inside out shirts; two different shoes but the right feet...go figure LOL and of course the ultimate:<br>  One time I walked out with my PJ bottoms on...when I got outside my husband was putting our daughter in her carseat and he looked me up and down and asked "Umm...you sure you want to wear that?"

x3fQP9viaa	Maybe it's just lack of sunshine that's got you down.  Get a membership to a community center, they offer daycare while you workout. Take the kids swimming while you are there.  Go to the mall.  Each day should be a clean slate for the kids, remind yourself not to yell, stop and breath or touch your toes or something, don't yell at them too much.|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	Our Church has a "Mothers day out" Check around for that.|`|9CMGO5fhaa	Tink has good ideas! Working out actually reduces stress and you mentioned many times that is exactly what you are feeling.|`|hUszhbPPaa	i went through almost the same thing! my son was 9mnths old and getting into everything and i babysat my roommates 2yr old daughter (her father worked 2 jobs, left before she woke up & got home after she fell asleep). the 2yr old was extremely clingy because she missed her daddy which made my son throw fits because he wanted to explore but didnt want her getting attention. there were fits thrown atleast every hour, it stretched me to the limit! i found myself getting angry faster and yelling more often. a lot of times i had to put them in their playpins and walk away for a few minutes. i felt so guilty yelling at them all the time and went online to research anger management and discipline (for both the children and myself). taking a lil advice from most of the pages i looked at i figured out ways to deal with my anger w/o yelling and stressing myself out. a lot of times i just had to ignore the behavior if i knew i wasnt gonna win the fight. i also found ways to change their behavior like consistently putting them in short time outs (like 2 minutes) every time they did something wrong, then explaining to them why they were put in time out. after being in the play pin for just about 2 days they slowly began to change the way they handled certain situations and even tapered off other things they werent supposed to do, like hitting and taking batteries out of the remote. it took a few weeks but things got better, a lot better. so research different topics that youre having trouble with and figure out a solution thats best for your family. good luck!

PbBWJGsTaa	The best thing to do at his age, is allow him to feed himself.  He's perfectly capable of finger feeding all he needs to eat at that age, and he will learn very quickly how far to push the food into his mouth so that he doesnt gag on it.  Spoonfeeding him, if you were planning on doing so, is more likely to make him gag as the food will be put further into his mouth than if he fed himself.|`|b99kfMPcaa	My son is also 8 months old and too has a bad gag reflex.  I can't give him the baby food jars of chicken because he gags on it.  The only thing that I've been able to do to ease this is by watering it down a little bit.  I noticed that if the food is not as thick, he gags less.  Also, making sure it is the right temperature helps.  As long as it's not too warm and not cold at all he eats it more eagerly.  I hope this helps!|`|J6LKqBqMaa	My son is 8 month may sound crazy but if i give him the spoon and let him do it himself he does not gag maybe that will work.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Gagging and choking are not the same thing.  Gagging is something feeling weird to the gag reflex.  Choking is something obstructing the airway.  Babies who gag are not choking and it is not dangerous.<br>  <br>  Sure, he might gag when you give him food, but it's okay.  It's not a big deal.|`|uezILpQcaa	My niece did the same thing. She was still on stage one of baby food at 1 year old. I would recommend taking him to a physical therapist or occupational therapist (at the moment, I can't remember which one does this) who specializes in infants and toddlers-yes they do exist, don't believe anyone who tells you different, not even the doctor. They can do some exercises to help him learn to swallow better. Also, keep an eye on his speech development. Troubles swallowing usually delays speech. It has with my niece. There are speech therapists who specialize in toddlers too.
MR9iBgafaa	I'd try the doctor; s/he may be able to prescribe a mouthwash or gel to help her.<br>  <br>  Edit - mouth ulcers can be caused by anything from viruses, to the her biting her cheeks/tongue etc.<br>  <br>  EDIT - the baby that died was due to its mother contracting the herpes (cold sore) virus so late on in pregnancy that she couldn't pass antibodies on.  It died a few days after birth and is not relevant to your baby's problem.|`|qjDxKXENaa	mouth ulcer in babies are very very dangerous. you must contact the doctor as soon as you can. i dont want to tell you anything bad to scare you but it was only on the news papers couple os days ago that a baby died from mouth ulcer due to being very weak to fight back.<br>  <br>  Edit: i dont know why you people giving thumbs down!!! i am only telling the truth. this baby was on the papers and news, maybe you should open your eyes more.|`|PdItdJkKaa	Its definitely best to consult your doctor.<br>  <br>  My 3 years old niece just got the same thing (maybe) from nursery (high temperature and mouth ulcer).<br>  <br>  She couldn't eat at all for about three days and only drank a little juice the rest of the days (the whole thing lasted about 8 days).<br>  <br>  She went to the doctor (twice) and we were told it was a a viral infection, she was given paracetamol and ibuprofen to use together and some pain relief and healing ointment for her mouth and lips.<br>  <br>  after a few days she got a little chesty cold and we were informed it had probably now become bacterial infection so she was prescribed some antibiotics.<br>  <br>  That was a week ago.... now she's a healthy as a horse running around and causing havoc as usual:-).<br>  <br>  Remember that my niece and your baby might not have the same thing so its best to see a doctor.|`|jhPlVj0oaa	It could be 'Hand, Foot and Mouth' disorder.  A very common and mild condition....but highly contagious.  Can put baby off his food.  If it is that, you'll need to keep her away from nursery until the ulcers have gone.  In my experience, children with this condition love anything cold, ice-cream, yoghurts and cold drinks.<br>  Good luck and I hope it's gone soon.|`|4JuwXJrEaa	You should  call her doctor's office.  How would she get a mouth ulcer?  You should find out what it is from.  Some viruses can cause that and you should find out if she's contagious and if she needs medicine.
0a3jBC1Jaa	Some women feel as though they're salivating more than usual during pregnancy, especially when they're nauseated. A few women have so much saliva they end up needing to spit to deal with it. Excessive salivation is called ptyalism or sialorrhea and is more common among women suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness.<br>  <br>  Experts don't know what causes some women to have excessive salivation in early pregnancy, but hormonal changes may be a culprit. Also, nausea might make some women try to swallow less, causing saliva to build up in the mouth.<br>  <br>  Under normal circumstances, your salivary glands produce about one and a half quarts of saliva a day, but because swallowing happens continually and unconsciously, you don't generally notice the saliva. So if you suddenly seem to have a lot more saliva in your mouth, it may be because you're actually producing more saliva or because you're swallowing less or a combination of the two.<br>  <br>  to read more go to the site below.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps:)|`|9ro8fiKvaa	Ha Ha - sorry to laugh but the though of your portable spit bottle is kind of funny. It's just one of those bizarre things that some people's bodies go through when they're pregnant. In my first pregnancy I had these faucet-like nosebleeds that lasted for 20 mins and then the biggest & most disguting clots would form and come out of my nose or mouth (the size of the plam of your hand!!!!) I ended up going to 'emergency' at the hospital because I was so alarmed at one point. I actually saved a clot in a tupperware dish and brought it into the hospital. The emerg Dr was very kind and with a smirk on his face told me that we pregnant people just have so much extra fluid in our bodies that sometimes we need to let go of some of it and not to worry. Hopefully the excess saliva is just a phase in your pregnancy and will subside. Otherwise, you'll have a pretty funny pregnancy anecdote! Try to see the humour in this situation and look forward to your beautiful baby on the way! (Maybe he/she will be a swimmer - hee hee - sorry, I couldn't help it!)
BkdZq0QPaa	the pills dont always work, they only really make you gain weight<br>  start doing chest excercises first and see how that works (alot of women reckon it makes them bigger)|`|aOCfLAJJaa	You can't absorbed estrogen orally. <br>  <br>  Sorry, you need to inject it. <br>  <br>  BUT you could just get surgery.<br>  <br>  boogiesmoomy06: Wrong, hormones are the ENTIRE reason girls (and some men) develop breasts. <br>  <br>  Estrogen causes fat to be deposited in those areas, so, there you have it.<br>  <br>  Guys, there is one hormone out of them all that can be orally absorbed, it was a type of insulin. It was dangerous and untested. <br>  <br>  This is why bodybuilders show needles into their buts, becuase it's the only way it will work. GH, Steroids, Testosterone, Insulin, Estrogens and IGF-1 all need to be INJECTED.|`|AA10186411	I would suggest a breast augmentation.  Messing with hormones is a very nasty business.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I wouldn't approach her asking for the pills. I would approach her saying you are uncomfortable with your breast size and you would like some help. She will be able to explore all the options there are out there with you as estrogen may or may not be the best answer for you. Talk to her, she'll understand.|`|PPoCaJEEaa	Just talk to her. I'm sure she'll understand, she's a girl so she understands what it's like.<br>  I'd suggest talking to your doctor about it first though with your mom and get their opinion and see if that's the best option for you.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	It might not even work.. made no change for me.. Good luck on beating the cancer <3|`|T9fek24eaa	Estrogen is not going to work hun. Either you will get boobs or you wont, hormones do not make you have breasts.|`|c79f90ad0249e7100a8a2e160e66a623aa	say you want your periods to be more regular|`|rOfFOcwpaa	Just ask your mother can she help you find an endocrinologist to prescribe you some estrogen so you can develope like all the other girls.<br>  <br>  Edit: Sorry, I seen all the misleading information. if you are young and in your teens, yes you will develop breasts. I am a little worried though since you say you've had cancer, b/c that's one of the side effects to taking estrogene period. And no, you do not need to inject estrogene although it is an option.  Typically women going through menapause take estrogene for osteoporosis, but sometimes younger women may take it because they can't produce their own estrogene for what ever medical reason. You're better off finding an endocrinologist and asking him all the questions.
dYXhvCpyaa	thats a terrible thing to say especially as you are the sole carer.<br>  he is only saying things like that to annoy you and hit a nerve.<br>  I wouldnt even bother with him and just spend every day enjoying your baby.<br>  move on and like the other answer if he says things like that again see a lawyer<br>  if thats your baby in the photo its gorgeous|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Establish paternity.  Pursue child support.  Let him have only supervised visits with the child.  Communicate with him as little as possible directly.|`|oF2kOKlnaa	Gee what a nice guy.<br>  He doesn't deserve to see your child and if he is willing to punch your head in what will he do to your child?|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Honestly?  I'd get a restraining order to keep him away from both you and your baby, go to court to work out child support and supervised visitation (so visits would include you being present as well as a 3rd party supervisor), and try to keep the ex out of the picture as much as possible until he changes his priorities.  Just because it's his baby doesn't mean that he has any claim to be a part of that baby's life if he is even talking about abuse.<br>  <br>  I would also find a "play group" even though the baby is kind of young, and some friends and family who could help relieve some of the burden of 24/7 care (even just helping or talking), and I would try to find ways to incorporate what I enjoy into that care. (Like taking my camera out with us on a stroller walk and taking pictures of cool stuff we see).|`|7Bsb0CNQaa	if he is telling people he "wants to punch your head in", then personally if it were me, I would get a court junction out against him and only allow him supervised visits with my child (with a liason officer).|`|U5RObaBGaa	ok just do what your doing put you and your baby first! sounds like he is the nut job to me|`|nmu6coapaa	What a jerk! How is he with your baby? I wouldn't have anything to do with him if I was you|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	I would go and get some legal advice, if he's threatening to be violent then you need to have something in writing to ensure he has supervised access.  You also need to get some financial arrangement sorted.  I wouldn't worry what he's saying to his mates, how old is he anyway?  Because he's acting like a child.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Well, that was a threat so I would definitely tell that to whomever it is who schedules these visits and ask they all be supervised because you don't want someone who "wants to punch your head in" watching your child, even if it is 3 hours a week.  He obviously has some anger management issues.|`|IlSGU9Yzaa	Not look to him for help. For whatever reason that he doesn't like you , you have to move on. Go to court in order to get proper support for your baby. If he wants to be apart of his/her life great, but you can't change him so now you can put all of your energy in baby|`|EsGrIscFaa	I would speak to your solicitor about how much child support he is paying and look into supervised visits with a liaison officer of some sort. If you are being kind enough to let this numb nuts see his child at all after what he's been saying then he at least needs to be paying his share.|`|mqvxIgRdaa	i wouldnt let him see the baby your his mom and he is being an awful person to you and your baby, I hope he gives you money otherwise i would tke hiss butt to court and have him stay away from you this is not good for you and the baby|`|oiJITSNZaa	I would go my own way. If you don't think it is life threatening to your baby for those three hours then I would just let him have his three hours and go my merry way otherwise. If you are scared that he will endanger your baby definitely take action!|`|AA11025762	i would concentrate on the baby! after all u r the winner, cos u get every minute of every day with the most precious thing on earth!<br>  <br>  let him have his 3 hours, then go home forget about him and enjoy ur baby.|`|g9TxgMlwaa	uh move on.

In September she got a tiny old fashioned school desk as she started school.<br>  <br>  She is 5 now and has around 14 charms; the bracelet is maybe 1/3 full.

ntdGOZqGaa	Yea she is she should give me the money hahahahaha|`|2ZrUko5uaa	He could save it for when hes older ; but a car maybe ; help use it for college funds ; some new clothes and shoes when hes older ; money to maybe just help out the family . I think your being selfish when your friend dies the LAST thing you should do is get mad cause she gave you no money ! If i was to die with a 2 week old baby i'd give him my money to cause its family and you love family ! She didnt leave the money for her 2 week old baby to go shopping , its obvioulsy because <br>  he would use it when his much much much older !|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	First, mind your own business - if your friend is going to save the money for her son's future, it is nothing to do with you.<br>  <br>  If she invests that $13,000 now, it will grow and grow so that when her son is ready for College, the money will be there.<br>  <br>  Invested carefully at 10%, that money will double in less than 8 years, so that now she has $13,000, in 8 years there will be $26,000, in 16 years there will be $52,000, 24 years from now she will have $104,000, and in 32 years from now, when she wants to retire, she will have $208,000 and if she waits until 40 years from now she will have the grand total of $416,000 to her name.<br>  <br>  Tell me again why she should spend money on her lazy friends?|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? It's her money she can do what she wants with it. If she is like most moms, her child is the most important person in her life, and wants him to have some money saved up for when he gets older, and if she puts it in an interest baring account, he will have even more money when he is grown (or older). I do NOT think she is being selfish, she is being smart, having a paid for car, and money in the bank for her son or his future.|`|AA10529334	Omg you are the most shallow person i have heard on here ever. Of course the money should go to her son not to buy you things.  It's gonna cost a heck of a lot more than that to raise him. Quit being selfish.|`|1Qvt2vtqaa	You're an idiot and the girl is doing the right thing thinking of her needs and her baby's future.  Just grow up and if you want to buy something do it with your own money.|`|01P1hVfWaa	This is the dumbest this i have ever heard. You're friend should stay far away from you. You are not the type of person i would want around my child.|`|d861778018432f5f26321e9fa06ec7faaa	rent, college, savings bond, school, daycare, food. She is not being selfish she is being smart. only dumb thing is having her having u as a friend.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	Let's see, 13000 in a bank for 18 years with compounding interest...why that is a damn good start for university.<br>  <br>  What are you going to do with it? Piss it away on useless ****?|`|rWoaRdljaa	you and the girl's friends are SO fuhking stupid. It's her son it can go into his college fund and his future which means her future as well. stop thinking about your fuhking self for 1 fuhking moment!!!|`|AA10116726	You are being selfish!!  The 2 week old will go to college someday!  Get over it, the mother is doing the right thing|`|pnL5WTXMaa	what are you, 10? ever hear of antisocial personality disorder? get over yourself.|`|xnV20aqbaa	why buy your friends stuff...when in the long run she could set up a college fund with the money for her son|`|AXEqOEloaa	You're a da*n idiot!|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	really?|`|smsUZG4Iaa	yea ok|`|mrxmFDqXaa	wow im sorry but your probably not a parent therefore your completely blinded to yourself. one day when you have a child maybe you'll then understand that your KID COMES BEFORE YOUR FRIENDS! hell its not your place to take care of their asses, its your place to take care of YOUR child.....plus take it from me i'm a mom that it cost a hell of a lot more than $13,000.00 to raise a child, that money will be put to good use if she uses it for Asher. maybe you should get a job.....?|`|lNqE8H8Paa	I'm sorry but you are an IDIOT. This money should be put away for the child for a later date to pay for schooling or anything else that the child needs. Why should she buy her friends stuff...get a job and buy your own things. If I were her I would also find some new friends, you are obviously not a good friend.|`|eF0vqSaXaa	Because the kid is going to grow up, you moron. And college is expensive!! I would know, I'm going to have to rack up about $8000 in loans my freshman year, and that's at a public university with tuition paid for!!!!!! <br>  <br>  You are by far one of the most selfish people I have ever heard up. Grow up and realize the world does NOT revolve around you!<br>  <br>  PS- I wish all mothers could be as responsible as she is as far as caring for and providing for her child.|`|sne1zGcyaa	are you kidding?<br>  I'm glad you're friend isn't as stupid as you..<br>  She's making a great choice by giving the money to her 2 week old. She could start a college fund for him, or use it for all the baby expenses.|`|iIhU8smiaa	It really doesn't matter.  What if it were your mom who died and left you money?  Would you want someone else to have part of it?|`|9qmWUg6xaa	Savings for college and future medical expenses.  A child is VERY expensive.|`|7jXChfBNaa	you are the most stupid ignorant fool i have ever seen. he is her son. why would she buy her friends anything? you have to be young ang DUMB!!!|`|DyCd0fCFaa	You sound like a horrible friend!People actually care about their children.I would do the same thing she did.Def. not selfish! But you are! Grow up.|`|jhPlVj0oaa	Seriously, I weep for the future of our planet with people like you around.  Dear God!!!|`|56238df610f5337752dc7843453a522daa	it's her money you IDIOT! and its her son you MORON! what do you care even if she gave her kid a million dollars!|`|WlU3NFu6aa	wow. you are so selfish<br>  he will need it later in life. for private school, college, car, house, whatever. <br>  its called saving and planning for the future. you may not know what it is, but adults like to do it|`|vwuMTm7Saa	Wow, she would be a really bad mom if she gave her money to her friends and didn't put it toward her child's future.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	buy you stuff dont you mean.|`|AA10628838	You are a friend? I doubt it. You sound more like a mooch and trying to get what you can from her.|`|8iYVHA1raa	She's obviously a lot more mature than you are.|`|oojO4WAraa	Don't be greedy.  Perhaps it is her son's college fund.|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	Children need a lot.  Perhaps, she is starting and saving for an emergency fund.  Also, she could be creating a college education fund.  It's called being an adult.  Just because you'd blow the money on your friends doesn't mean the girl can't be responsible or a good mother and spend it on her son.<br>  <br>  Grow up...you're being selfish her getting funds doesn't entitle you to HER family's money.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Sounds like a responsible decision to me.<br>  <br>  I am sure she is not going to spend it all on a two week old.  It will either be saved for him (college, etc.) or used over time to meet his needs.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you are selfish and bratty.|`|HBUO10i7aa	YOUR ATTITUDE SAYS IT ALL......SOME FRIEND YOU ARE TO REFER TO HER CHILD AS HER EFING SON! YOU ARE A GREEDY, SELFISH PARASITE THAT NEEDS TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO BE "FRIENDS" WITH AND LEAVE THIS WOMAN ALONE. MAYBE SHE'D LIKE TO PUT SOME MONEY INTO A COLLEGE ACCOUNT FOR HER SON SO HE CAN HAVE A BETTER LIFE THAN SHE HAD.WHAT A TOAD YOU ARE TO THINK FOR A SECOND THAT YOU ARE ENTITLED TO ANY OF HER $$$$$! UNBELIEVABLE!!|`|zHRWklEWaa	Have you seen how much college costs now? The money would be very useful in a trust fund for the child, or just to but diapers and food for the baby.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	She might be thinking a "COLLEGE EDUCATION" something that obviously missed your gene pool.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	Babies don't cost money? Why haven't I gotten the memo!|`|48b84a8f546ab32d894f3370f4eca47faa	I'm guessing you're not really close.|`|wNLmGzSwaa	What?
URbMCRFLaa	I know you said it's definately a period, but you said right after that that it lasted 5 days. You probably know it was your period because of the flow too but I just wanted to tell you that implantation bleeding can show about a week before your period and can last anywhere from 1-7 days as I've read. I'm currently waiting to see if I'm pregnant because I spotted for 5 days a week before my period. I never got a period after that. The symptoms you're describing sound like you may be pregnant so you may want to try a pregnancy test one to two weeks after you started your period just to make sure that it was your period and not implantation bleeding. Lots of women can have one or more periods while they are pregnant too. Good luck with everything, I hope you find out soon!
Q0xm1Kodaa	What do you mean the line wasnt in the right spot? If that was 5 day before your missed period test I would wait. If not take the other one. I'm in the same situation but have 6 days before missed period. Baby dust!|`|kmGW34unaa	dat ain nutt'n baby. *** over to my place on da korner of fif and lenkon|`|AaxIZSTwaa	I took a test from the dollar store, and also the line wasn't in the right spot!

AA12145826	There are so many options out there besides minivans for larger families. SUV's, station wagons (they're making a comeback), and the newer "cross-over" models (SUV's built on car frames for better handling without sacrificing the space) are just some of the options. Plus, even if you think you're "anti-minivan" its not just for soccer mom's anymore. They come with so many options and conveniences I know plenty of parents with just 1 kid who drive them.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	If you have 5 children, then you will need a car that seats 7 people.  You can drive a Suburban or a van.  My parents had 5 kids, and we always had a van.  Not a minivan, just a regular van.  I also know lots of people who drive SUV's.  Some will seat 5 and some will seat 7.|`|XOtOMncwaa	If I ever find myself in that situation then I will get an SUV with third row seats.|`|a1uoxczTaa	SUVS or station wagon.|`|sCKJzcNpaa	does your car have a roof?|`|G2auAv1Saa	One with a third row. <br>  They make larger SUV's so you don't have to drive a van.|`|AA11210211	I only have 2 children but I have a mini van and a pt cruiser,Honestly the thought of driving a mini van wasn't very appealing to me until I test drove it then I fell in love!!! lol|`|WlU3NFu6aa	We only have one right now but we will eventually have at least one more. my husband is a big guy and he will not fit in the front with 2 car seats back there. with it in the middle he is able to push the chair back. I have been looking into 7 passenger SUV's. I dont want a minivan either. seams too big for me.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Minivan or suv for all the kids. Another car for the commute.|`|sl8ffVHVaa	I have 4 kids and I drive a suburban with the third row seat. I Love it and I would not go to a mini van|`|T864ejaiaa	i have a high top van. 4 kids, 3 still at home.
44ujDxwqaa	yes.. especially their(kids) emotional upbringing. they need to be careful on how to raise their children so that their children will walk the right path of life.|`|R5IAmQAVaa	Absolutly not, I wish parents were LESS careful with their kids.   Seems like now adays, parents are putting their kids in bubbles and afraid to let them get hurt.  Seems like parents are starting to create a generation of woosies.... afraid to get dirty, afraid to work hard, afraid to get hurt, afraid they will put a hole in their jeans.<br>  <br>  I understand car seats, and bike helmets, and things like that... those are all fine.  But kids need to be given free reign to make their own mistakes and learn from their own mistakes... Being over careful with them may keep them from getting hurt, but it certainly isn't teaching them anything about life.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	What do you mean by more careful of their kids? I know that I am more safety conscious with my kids. Like when I am driving with my kids in the car I drive a lot more carefully than I do normally.|`|v0596BTeaa	Some adults, yes.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	yes|`|Yh4CXJgdaa	i would think so.. look at yahoo answers for example , 13 year old kids want to have babies now... wtf?? sum1 please explain lol|`|pnL5WTXMaa	yes - in fact the government should step in regulate how parents take care of their children.|`|X2FrjG8Laa	yes they should|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Yes for sure>
DvnOIx1laa	awe giggles, you know I love you, so I cannot be harsh with you!<br>  I would say that I enjoyed a beer a couple times a week while pregnant with my daughter. I honestly think that your baby will be fine, however, I would strongly suggest not doing it again. Stick to some cold beer, and wait for the hard stuff for when you are celebrating the birth!!!! Good luck darlin!|`|IOp3knBjaa	Seriously, What was the point of drinking it just to sit at your desk and take it easy? Why take that risk? Alcohol is ok in moderation, but something like a small glass of wine once a month, not shots of Jack Daniels! Maybe I'm a little harsh as I do not drink at all while pregnant, but instead of bringing it here and asking others to "support their answers" why not google it yourself?|`|vA5z3aPmaa	1~ why are you drinking in the first place<br>  #2~ You should think more of the baby then you do yourself and your fun!<br>  #3~ Dont tell me what to say about a topic that means alot to some mothers!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	yeah i don't really think 3 shots of jack is moderation, if anything one shot should have been where you stopped. And if it was enough to get you drunk then it was too much. Your baby is still developing limbs and brain cells hopefully you didn't mess up the process. and seriously its only a couple of months you need to do better. I turned 21 in december but i'll probably be closer to 22 before i start to drink again. Granted i want to, my baby's health is just to important to risk over a daiquiri.|`|AA10693194	no drinking is best as you already know.But I don't think 3 shots is in moderation maybe 1 I would say would be in moderation. Jack Daniels is hard alcohol. in moderation would be a drink of wine once in a while. Or a beer once or twice in the pregnancy. <br>  what made you want to drink in the first place? <br>  <br>  I think your baby will be fine though.Just don't be so silly when you are pregnant hun!!! wait till after baby is here and go have some fun:)<br>  <br>  if you continue to drink baby could have fetal alcohol syndrome.|`|wLLylvN2aa	Fetal Alcohol Syndrome! while of recent dr have being saying moderate drinking is ok there still is no definete amount that we know well cause your baby to have FAS, so why even chance it. Those 3 shots may be enough!
hFoYmSgqaa	i get it on prescription for my little boy, he now only has to have one bottle a day with colief in, get some standard neck bottles with variflow teats or mams bottles (these can be found in mothercare. colief has worked really well for us he has had it since december we tried all the normal stuff like you nothing worked until a friend recommended colief. we have not had any colic for 3 months now if it gets bad we just up the amount of colief ie from one bottle back to all bottles and the reduce as directed. also stand him up nice and tall and then wind him or sit him up nice and tall (this can be hard)but really seems to help. you coud also try fennel tea if he takes solids or juice. his poo will change to being looser but that doesn't bother us now as it is easier for them to pass especially is they are formula fed. hope this helps<br>  **edit** it is a natural enzyme called lactase and it helps to break down lactose (milk sugar)some babies are lacking this and do not have a true allergy or intolerance to milk but they just are unable to break this sugar down by six months this should have sorted it self out. my dr says it is a lack of these enzymes that cause a lot of colic. using this causes no side effects apart from a softening of their poos unlike infacol, gripe water etc as these contain sugars and sweetners which are bad for babies and can make the whole situation worse.<br>  **edit** craniol oestopathy can work in some cases but not all it didn't work for my little one we were at our wits end with the crying and the colic but i have honsetly seen good results with colief and it is safer than 'new age techniques' as it a naturally occurring enzyme. infacol doesn't work either. stick with colief and follow the instructions but it can take a little while to get going it took a week of four drops in every bottle before we saw a difference but we certainly don't get colic now|`|MR9iBgafaa	Has the doctor checked for milk/lactose intolerance?  There was a baby at my baby massage group whose baby screamed day and night, and turned out to have a lactose allergy.  She has to have soya milk.  Her doctor never picked up on it, and only an experienced health visitor noticed.<br>  <br>  If it truly is colic, they usually calm down by 3 months.  Colic is an unknown syndrome that makes a baby cry excessively. They think it's a stomach problem but there's actually no proven reason for the screams.<br>  <br>  I hope it gets better.|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	Try infant gaviscon - you can buy it or get  a prescription. although you have tried the gripe water I thought it was great - I put it in all my daughters bottles and she was never bothered with wind again - that was 29 years ago. Put him down to sleep as he is testing you with the crying but if you left him he will play on it, even though hes only 8 weeks old - it does no harm for them to cry, it is natural, let him cry for 5 minutes before lifting and each day make it a bit longer and he will soon settle - you only feel like this because its your first baby, you will soon learn your mistakes.|`|cJQL64ylaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  We tried it with our 2, but unfortunately it didn't make a huge difference.  Infacol was probably the most successful medicine (if you ask your GP they can prescribe it for you), but the biggest difference that we found was when we took them to a cranial osteopath when they were about 2 months old.  It really seemed to help, particularly with one of them.  <br>  <br>  I was a bit skeptical, but had 2 friends who had really colicky babies and it worked a treat with them so we gave it a go and had great results.<br>  <br>  The other thing that helped us was a baby carrier (well, 2 in our case, 1 each for me and my husband) as it meant I could do things like cook, go to the loo, clean, etc...  Our 2 were really clingy until we sorted their colic and the baby carriers worked like a dream!<br>  <br>  Other than that, all I can say is that it should hopefully ease off at around 12-14 weeks, but that's not much help at the moment is it...<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Nic x
46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Youre born with a certain amount of eggs. You will NEVER use them all up before you get to menopause. Whether youve been pregnant or not, youll end up at non fertility at basically the same time. So no, you dont add 8 more months at all.|`|X6as2nOAaa	it doesn't add 8 more months|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No that's not true at all. :) You are born with 2 millions eggs. You dont' use all 2 million.:)|`|OPTDFRuzaa	em no i think you get the menopause when your about 50-55 and thats that.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	i've never heard of that before. but i dont think so.|`|smsUZG4Iaa	oh god just go to sleep...|`|wTYh7DiSaa	By the time you are born you only have certain amount of eggs, PERIOD. While a man can create 2 billion sperm each ejaculation. This is why a lot of women does not like to get unnecessary x-rays because it exposes her eggs to radiation, the logic being if she only has so many she would like to keep the chances of them all being healthy very high. So regardless if you get pregnant every month or every year, or every 5 years.. you have as much fertility left as the eggs you are carrying. By the time that supplies dries up, you hit menopause.|`|p9Siz3BBaa	No, that's not how it works, although I understand your question. The length of time overall that a woman is fertile is related to hormone levels, which change as we age. Also since we have all the eggs present for our entire lives rather than making new eggs, the eggs continue to age with us and so fewer and fewer are viable.
ioGfuwOPaa	Chloe Avalie Paige is a beautiful name and so is Chloe Ava Paige. I don't see anything wrong with either one of them.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	I love it just the way you have it.

oAyOEkQYaa	My daughter has dark circles under her eyes, she  is 14 now, and has had them since she was 2.<br>  <br>  We too took her to the Doctors and they diagnosed her with sinusitis, she also had really bad tonsillitis almost every month.  Every time they were due to come out she took ill and the doctors wouldn't do the op.<br>  <br>  When she was 9 she finally got them out and the dark circles disappeared, we thought that would be it cured, but about a month later they came back, and she still has them.<br>  <br>  She has really pale skin and gets the correct amount of sleep, and the only other medical condition she has is anaemia, she takes Iron supplements provided by the Doctor.<br>  <br>  <br>  She is in good health, and now she is older we allow her to wear light makeup to help cover, but it doesn't bother her too much.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Is she sleeping right? I mean thats the obvious reason why people have dark circles. Sometimes its just a skin thing, my friend had that for no reason.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	maybe boost her iron in her diet that might help|`|cteyFJxhaa	She may be slightly iron deficient.  Not unusual at all in young girls before their bodies learn to regulate themselves (periods etc.)  Mention it to the Doc next time she's there.<br>  <br>  Add:  Sorry read 14 years instead of months....duh...either way it still doesn't hurt to check with the doc.|`|TLjbMQPRaa	Its from all the SEX she is having and all the WEED she is smoking.|`|UCsDwqEraa	my daughter has dark circles under her eyes,she wears glasses but also is not a good sleeper and never has been she is 15
EcdelIHtaa	i dont like it at all|`|CRvdmFwCaa	I think it's super cute!  Piper is the real name of the girl that starred in Coyote Ugly.  Piper is adorable.<br>  <br>  Piper and Poppy sound cute|`|CCA0mTgsaa	I LIKE PEPPER BETTER|`|pCbzhOrkaa	I like Piper! Its so cute, spontanous and friendly. How about <br>  Piper Adley<br>  Piper Sunday<br>  Piper Emri <br>  Piper Vivian<br>  Piper Shay<br>  Piper Caraway|`|fKCWfCviaa	i love it for some reason.<br>  i used to be obsessed with the girl name Piper on Charmed.<br>  i just think its very pretty sounding!|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I like Piper and funny enough Poppy is growing on me LOL!<br>  Piper Laurel is pretty :)|`|9OKG0a5Baa	piper is lovely.  and no its not too "out there".<br>  how about;<br>  piper ann<br>  piper marie<br>  piper alexandra<br>  piper jane<br>  piper suzanne<br>  piper amelie<br>  piper gabrielle<br>  piper colette<br>  piper nicole<br>  piper sian (sharn)<br>  piper siobhan (sha-vorn)<br>  piper joelle<br>  piper faith.<br>  <br>  good luck and congratulations|`|jhPlVj0oaa	I think it is way too out there.  Sounds like a name a 'celebrity' might give their child.  I don't mind unusual names but in the playground a 'Piper' might get teased by other kids.|`|PRGUQFVqaa	i think its beautiful and unique with a hip freshness to it- also a new one My friend named her daughter was paisley- soooo cute!|`|cp32nEVWaa	It,s cute but let's try Holly or Jasmine|`|23c763254f5a6dfdf99dce884971fc00aa	I think it is going to be over used because of Sarah Palin|`|D5cOFZdwaa	i think the name piper for a girl is super super cute. ummmmm middle names: claire or anne would be cute
zHy0z7sAaa	Honestly when they did mine I didn't even know she was doing it.They basically take a q-tip and swap the area.Its completely painless.They do it to check for Strep B, which you may be a carrier of and have absolutely no symptoms but it could be passed on to the baby on its trip down the birth canal and could possibly be harmful to it.I promise you won't feel a thing.|`|wTYh7DiSaa	It's Group B Strep. I tested positive with my last pregnancy, so when I went into labor I was given antibiotics just in case it was still present when I delivered. The Group B Strep is present in our vagina, intestines and rectal area. However, it comes and goes whenever it wants. So, they test you about 2 weeks before "term" 37 weeks to make sure that it isn't present then, because if it does come back positive they will have to administer antibiotics before you give birth. I only had one dose because there was no time, usually however, they do 2 doses.. 4 hours apart. My little nugget was born with no complications whatsoever.<br>  <br>  With my current pregnancy, I tested negative.. woohoo!!<br>  <br>  It isn't a big deal, cotton swab around your anus and vagina.. it sounds more graphic that what they really do. You won't feel a thing unless they are giving you the run down as they are doing it ;)|`|46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	A rectal culture is when the doctor uses something that resembles a qtip to take a sample of the fluids found at your rectum. <br>  They use this information to find out if you have group b strep, which is an infection that can affect the baby at birth, if born vaginally. If you are positive for group b strep the doctors will have to give you medication intravenously to help make sure the baby is not affected.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	The doctor take a q-tip like swab and rubs it around the outside of your anus, to test from Strep B. if it is found, they will give you IV antibiotics while in labor so you don't pass the Strep to your baby.|`|VLRZT9Foaa	It's just a q-tip that they will put into the opening of your rectum - it would not be painful.  However, my doctor didn't do that with either of my sons.|`|eKls7ooUaa	its not that bad-q-tip around the outside of the anus and then one inside your vagina-checking for any bacterial infections that would harm the baby when being born-no biggie-it takes like 5 seconds.|`|4GwTDea1aa	Just had mine Monday.. Its for the Group B strep test..they just use a cotton swab and swab your rectum and vagina.. takes 5 seconds.. not bad at all!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	just swabing around your anus- it's the group b strep test- i never got because i delivered right before i got it at 36 weeks but i have heard it's not biggie|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	All they do is take a cotton swab and go around the outside of your vagina and rectum. It sounds a lot worse than it is, I asked a friend about it too because I was concerned. :]|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	They are checking for Strep B.  All they do is take Q-Tips and swab your vagina and rectum.  It's very simple and only takes a second.  No big deal at all.<br>  <br>  Sounds terrible though doesn't it LOL :)|`|s1utniuvaa	I think it depends on your doctor. I have one doctor who has never bothered my tush and another one who popped a finger in there with no warning and I almost FLIPPED out lol...|`|XhIYAH6Laa	They just take a q-tip and swap the outside of the anus...tmi I know, but only take a sec and you really don't even notice it!|`|V8wUAVdyaa	they just run a cotton swab in between your butt cheeks.  takes a few seconds.  you prob wont even notice|`|hSJnaysiaa	Oh my god. I am so worried now. My 36 week appointment is TODAY, and coincidently its the first appointment other than ultrasounds that my husband is going to since he's had scheduling issues so I was hoping for a normal appointment....I don't want anything going anywhere near my booty or vag today and I certainly don't want my hubby there to watch! I hope that website was lying.<br>  <br>  Of course it probably wasn't lying and I'm in for an afternoon of humiliation. Yay for me :(|`|bZBByJAAaa	Never heard of that. What they did was the test with the swap to test for bacteria so they can treat you during labor so that the baby doesn't pass through the bacteria. It sounds like groupie strap. It's totally misspelled but that's what I heard her say. <br>  <br>  But she inserted the swap in my vagina not in my rectum.|`|QoenvlFuaa	You know, I had read that when I was at that stage of pregnancy, and I was not looking forward to that at all! But I either never had it done, or it was so minimal that I didn't realize it had been done. Don't worry about it and congrats. Best of luck!|`|RzYePezkaa	They just take a cotton swab and rub it quickly on your vagina and your bum it is to check for group B strep which can be harmful to babies if not treated during the labor process.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Its probably the Group B Strep test. Which is a routine test. It is a quick q-tip swipe on vaginal and rectal area, painless.|`|xPR7g0wFaa	Never heard of that hun.I wouldnt worry about it,Ive had 3 babies without anyone doing that to me,Is it something new? Good Luck with your new little one!|`|z74wSbQoaa	I think that depends on your doctor.  I've been through two pregnancies and have not had a rectal culture.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	They swab your bum. No big deal. <br>  <br>  Congrats!
zSABr7praa	Yuck that happens to me, too, when i'm drinking coffee.  I distract myself and it passes.  Once when I was craving one after having coffee with breakfast at a diner, I walked past the smoking section to get to the restroom and it completely cured my craving..the smell of second hand smoke is SO off putting!  I don't suggest inhaling a bunch of second hand smoke, but it really did the trick.. whenever I smell any i'm so glad I quit.|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	Think about your child.<br>  Thats how I gave up smoking and drinking. I used to be a mean pisshead and chain smoker, but now I don't because I know that my childs life is more important than any craving I have for cancer-sticks or alcohol. Their well-being is much more important than anything!<br>  Put them first... not yourself.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i know its hard i also quit smoking when i found out i was pregnant with my first that was almost three years ago and truthfully i still crave a smoke almost everyday.  just keep thinking about that poor baby inside of you choking on smoke if you had one and how wonderful it will be to have a healthy happy baby.  chew some gum and go watch tv .|`|yPNvecc7aa	You have to distract yourself and forget about the craving.<br>  Coming on Yahoo Answers and writing about it won't help you!<br>  <br>  Do some laundry, eat something, check your email, make a phone call, anything else!<br>  And remember, you've come too far to screw it up now.<br>  : )|`|52U22fiAaa	I'm so glad I'm not a smoker...I can only imagine how hard it is to quit.  You need to think of your baby though, don't give in!!!!  Not to mention, it's bad for you too ( yeah, I know you've heard it a million times ).|`|AA10770446	think about how much time you have invested in being a non smoker.  it will never be that easy to quit again.  be strong!!|`|UDENYO4raa	It doesn't! I hate to disappoint you, but it really is hard.. I was a smoker for 4 years, and I still crave it every now and then. If you relapse though, don't kick yourself. Just keep trying. <br>  <br>  And btw, I COMPLETELY know the feeling of the coffee and cigarettes... There's just NO better combination...|`|ybtJJmJHaa	You have to find something to distract you. I alternate between hard candy and snacks like carrot sticks. I know it stinks, but I just quit cause I don't want to stink, you have all the motivation in the world in your stomach. Be strong and good luck!|`|J6LKqBqMaa	Good for the smoking.I don't think you have to give up coffee i had it with all three kids i went with organic coffee.Just drinks lots of water. Don't feel bad you need something for you :>)|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	You never really stop craving a smoke. It gets less over time with periods of one. It took me about a year to really not want one. I need to quit and Im having a bitXh of a time Congratulations hun!!!
WWcaKZ7Qaa	You could test now. Buy one of the tests that say "early results" on them. My personal favorite would be the First Response Early Results tests. I got an obvious positive about 4 days before I even missed my period. I took the test first thing in the morning so the urine would be more concentrated. They say on the box how accurate the tests are. Each day closer to your period they get more and more accurate at detecting hCG. My recommendation is to buy a kit with more than one test just in case you get a negative result so you can test again later to be sure. Good luck.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I would wait a week, then take a test. You can test as early as 20-25 days after unprotected sex, although the results are much more accurate after 30 days. So maybe go from that. If it has been 30 days, take a test. Yuo don't necessarily have to miss you period to test, I tested before mine ever started and got a positive right away.|`|ccqOhsGtaa	I am not due on my period until Friday/Saturday & I have got a postive today!!<br>  <br>  Test tomorrow with the first mornings pee<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck & Lots of Baby Dust xx<br>  EDIT  I have just got a positive on a ClearBlue Digital!!!|`|V8wUAVdyaa	you can go ahead and take it.  remember that even a faint line is still a positive reading|`|kH56qw2Taa	take it tomorrow xx|`|AA11783671	Check the box, but I think EPT you can take 5 days before your period.  You should be safe now.  Just a suggestion if you're worried about altering the results... pee in a dixie cup and dip the stick.  Hold it in there for 10 secs or whatever and then lay it flat.  Check it when you're supposed to after however many mins because if you wait too long, it can alter results as well.  Good luck either way.|`|46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	I would use a first response early results test. That detects the smallest amount of HCG (the pregnancy hormone). I would also use first morning urine, that would probably be the most accurate. <br>  Good luck.|`|kuj20srVaa	take it two weeks after youve had sex.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Go ahead and take one. Of course you could get a false negative. You could even get one 3 days after your missed period. It all depends on when you implanted and there is no way of knowing when that happened. You may have to just rely on a bit of patience. It sucks though. I know. :)
AA11876718	You are so kidding us!!! Is this like a FRENCH fran?ois paris person saying Rainbow his own way?? beaux that's plural so I can't even tell if it's more like girly or boyish!|`|poxYuNRGaa	Ummmm you do know that your child will have to learn how to spell his or her name right? Also, I hope you realize that when your child wears a name tag at their job, no one is going to know how to say their name so they will be called "hey you" for a while. Furthermore, this name sucks.|`|p9Siz3BBaa	Only for a showhorse.<br>  <br>  I appreciate you wanting something unique, but think about how many times the poor kid will have to spell their name to others!|`|DwkUUQqhaa	No. Please don't do that to your child if that's what you're referring to.<br>  <br>  Have a wonderful day. <3|`|edLbogmYaa	I think it is a crazy name and no child boy or girl should have such a crazy a** wacko name.|`|6xmIPYimaa	very unusual. not a good name for a boy or girl.|`|pl7lWGZDaa	It's a name that should be left to the celebrities :X|`|EcdelIHtaa	Umm i dont like it that is if im pronouncing it right|`|3DbNC6WDaa	i think it too long and hard to pronounce i personlly don't like it|`|a1uoxczTaa	is it pronounced rainbow?|`|m8wMKhOoaa	its better for the color thing thats<br>  in the sky after it rains.|`|naI5hGjHaa	that's great if your baby is a drag queen|`|BCIfeHAqaa	I hate that! <br>  Sounds like something you'd name a monkey.|`|QDUw9TDfaa	how do you pronounce it ?|`|PF1sEcujaa	I like weird....but this ones a little too weird to me.|`|Elxuvon8aa	heck no it is horrid for either|`|86oPkfzOaa	Not really, spell it Rainbow.|`|bmoCpcdraa	sounds bad ,think if you were a child and some kid in your class was named that , just think of all the teasing you can do,,,|`|nAOlBmzDaa	its hippie and the spelling is ridiculous...|`|9g734Pjaaa	I think it sounds silly.|`|UjFfdquLaa	I don't like it for either gender sorry.|`|JGpirCtLaa	A girl.<br>  I don't like the beaux part though.<br>  I would like it better as Reignboe or Reignbo or Reignboh<br>  I hate Beau being used as "Bo", eau does not make an O sound.<br>  <br>  I don't particularly like the name, I do know a little girl with the name though. I think this spelling is much better than Rainbow though! <br>  <br>  Her name is Rainbow and she doesn't get made fun of by kids for those of you who say they would get teased.|`|pOekC2Sqaa	Reignbeaux - please, don't use that name. Its not a name for an animal - let alone a child. Its horribly cheesy and tacky and I absolutely hate it. Sorry.<br>  <br>  G2B|`|chfILbonaa	I think it is beautiful for a girl or boy but mostly a girl its very unique and the only down side is that people might mistpronounce it but im sure they wont|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Reign for the girl and Beaux for the boy|`|R1cey1Evaa	Haha very funny.|`|fVxnoREUaa	No. It looks silly and pretentious.|`|ZB21OPjdaa	No I don't like it, sorry.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	no i don't like it, it's too hippy-fied and weirdly spelt!
J3yUXKiyaa	Yes, daddy.  You sure can.  Get support payments ready if that's your plan of attack for birth control.<br>  <br>  Buy some condoms.|`|dtZ3tmoRaa	you sure can....it definitely is not impossible....I would stick to using actual protection if you are not looking to have a baby.|`|ACTa6N5Naa	Simple answer is yes! However, less likely to get in a girl to get pregnant with pre *** rather that real deal!  Practice safe sex if you don't want babies!!|`|DMsjoZwSaa	Yeeeep! The pre-*** has sperm in it-not AS much as the actual ejaculate, but remember, it only takes one!|`|AA11049477	if you're referring to the withdrawal method, yes she can still get pregnant<br>  just one little sperm is all it takes, <br>  put a condom on & use spermicidal cream to guarantee contraception.<br>  <br>  .|`|smsUZG4Iaa	why pull out if you want a kid
WWfL5tMvaa	I know exactly how you feel. there are some tests that can give you results 5 days before your period. but it would be more accurate to wait till the period is late.<br>  and no not every pregnant woman gets implantation bleeding <br>  try to relax and get it off of your mind i know it is easy said i can't do that my self<br>  LOTS OF BABY DUST TO YOU, ME AND EVERYONE TTC|`|wKl85RGvaa	Well you can test early and  possibly get a BFN<< disappointing though, or you could get a BFP but it might just be a little too soon for that result if you are pregnant. I would say if you can wait then try to wait. I'm due the 10th as well and its killing me. I have been cramping for a week and extremely moody. Best of luck to you <br>  ~*~*~Baby Dust~*~*~*|`|EaDkj1JJaa	I say if you don't want to wait then go for it...but just keep in mind that it might be too early so don't get completely disappointed if it comes back negative! I took a hpt almost a week before and it came back positive and here I am 30 weeks pregnant!<br>  Good luck...I wish you nothing but the best!!|`|NbBe2o9Taa	Yes you should wait, I'm the same way though,  I say im going to wait then I go to the store for something and end up buying a HPT too.  If you keep testing to soon you'll continue to get a negative and continue to be disappointed. Good Luck!|`|NWvrf0gcaa	i am on the same boat i have been at this for 6months i tested 2 days ago and it was negative i know it was to soon ..but you could test like 12 or 13 dpo|`|bec62dace9d0d98bb1a3ab830e23d22aaa	Always wait til after it is due.
AA11903503	You should buy whatever you feel comfortable buying.<br>  Yes, you can buy a car seat used if you are comfortable with that, they DO NOT need to be replaced after an accident, this has been changed. In addition, most people who decide to sell their car seats do so in order to recoup some cash but more importantly sell it to help someone else out and not have to pay so much. I will sell my car seat on craigslist when I am done. If you do decide to purchase it make sure it is a newer model, or that the expiration date is clearly marked. Next, if you have insurance and you are in an accident and need to file a claim they will inspect the car seat and in most cases take the car seat. Yes, when a car seat is in an accident most insurance companies will seize or tag the seat and the cost will be reimbursed. So I doubt the public is out there selling damaged car seats.<br>  Anyway, I bought many things off of craigslist, the only thing I would not buy are baby bottles...I'm not really sure why though considering all the people that touch them in the factory and all the factory dirt.|`|4JuwXJrEaa	Not formula since you don't know how it's been stored (temperature, humidity, etc.) and you don't know if it's been tampered with.  It's not worth taking a chance.<br>  <br>  Not a car seat because it doesn't work if it's been in an accident.  There's no way you can be sure of this unless you buy one from someone you know or a new one from the store.<br>  <br>  Bouncer should be OK since you can wash the cover for it.  Things that you can clean like an exersaucer, high chair or a swing would be OK.<br>  <br>  Clothes would be fine, just wash them in hot water before you use them on your baby.|`|yZDyUfSNaa	Would: Things that can be safely cleaned and sanitized without ruining them. Examples: Stroller, bouncy chairs, swings, bumbo, plastic toys, furniture and clothes. <br>  <br>  Wouldn't: Things that could possibly affect the safety of my baby or that would be gross. Never a car seat -- they have expiration dates (seriously) and you cannot tell if one has been in an accident, which according to the manufacturers could affect the integrity of the seat. Other no nos IMO would be a crib, bottles, feeding utensils, boppy (I know how much milk my babies spit/dribbled on them and ewww I would not want someone else's dried milk in the pillow I'm laying my baby's face on). I probably wouldn't buy formula either, especially not pre-opened canisters, as God only knows if it was tampered with somehow.<br>  <br>  Oh, and anything that I buy I would check to make sure there wasn't a recall on it.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	I have bought a carseat, bouncer, bottles, bassinet, breat pump, bathtub, more.<br>  <br>  I closely inspect everything and anything I buy. And I do judge a book by it's cover and only go through with purchases from people who seem reputable. Money is extremely tight for my family and craigslist is a great source for the necessities of a newborn.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	Car seat! If you are lucky, you will find almost brand new one but you'll never know for sure if it's defective or not. <br>  <br>  Crib. Again, if you are lucky, you will get almost brand new one but crib & car seat need to be really safe for your baby. Please buy new if you can. You don't need to buy a fancy one but just get a safe & new one.|`|354822650b94793ca343e12161f6ec55aa	I wouldn't buy opened packs of diapers, used cloth diapers, I wouldn't get a breast pump, stuff like that.  I have bought a bumbo, some toys, a rain forest jumperoo and other stuff like that. I also bought an eddie bauer double stroller that I could not find anywhere to match my 6 month olds car seat.|`|UDENYO4raa	Definately don't buy a car seat off of there.. You never know how defective it can be... You could probably trust just about anything else, but you know you'd never forgive yourself if you got in a car wreck and something happened with the car seat. And don't buy formula off of there either... People are just crazy now a days...|`|AA11134717	car seat or bottles or formula|`|aXf4wBcvaa	I would never buy a car seat used. You have no way of knowing if that car seat had been involved in a car accident and was structurally damaged.|`|sVjLSGThaa	I would NEVER buy a used CAR SEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  You Never Know What It Has Been Through & May Not Be Safe|`|pXSKSS3daa	Bottles, pacifiers, formula(unless I could be certain it was unused and not expired), or a car seat(this one especially. You have no idea if it's been in accidents, recalled, etc.).|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I wouldn't buy bottles, toys that were meant to be sucked on, or formula.  <br>  <br>  Bouncer, car seat (if recent and in good condition) swing, exersaucer, baby furniture (recent and in good condition) I would go for it.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I wouldn't buy formula.<br>  <br>  Teething toys can be well sterilized. Some car seats are still in boxes for whatever reasons the people didn't use them.

dPphaRLEaa	when i was pregnant with my son i could not even look at eggs, idk why but just the thought made me sick...lol|`|46K4FtE0aa	Not as much an aversion, but i love steak puddings, always have and with my first, i would eat one then throw it immediately back up, but the craving for one was so bad i had to have one, this went on all through the pregnancy.<br>  my daughter is a smoker and with her first she didn't need to pack them in, she couldn't stand the smell or taste of them. immediately baby was born she was back on them|`|r9epzkJVaa	My first 5 pregnancies, I couldn't eat any kind of meats at all, and my 6th pregnancy, couldn't eat meat or salads. Couldn't eat salads until my 6th baby was more than 6 months old. I think this is common in most pregnancies, at least for the first trimester.|`|wphI41wNaa	That happened to me I couldn't drink anything red or some foods I'd look at and be like "I will totally throw that up if I eat it" lol Congrats on your 6th!|`|Heyz3xp9aa	I knew someone that didnt like some foods while they were pregnant but liked them once they had their baby|`|7RH1WmWOaa	Yes meat..I couldn't see it, smell it or eat it.|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	Coffee (which i guess is a good thing), the smell and thought of it makes me want to hurl.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Oh yeah. I think I've had more aversions than cravings! Chicken is the worst, I can't even think about eating that. In fact, I can't even pass it in the grocery store without gagging a bit, it's ridiculous! Most meat has a nauseating effect on me now in general really.<br>  <br>  Jas-- I do that too! Ugh, I prepare an awesome meal and then by the time it's finished the smell has made me so sick I either have to go out and get something for myself or eat something simple like a sandwich. It's getting very old!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Did I suddenly develop any food aversion or every food aversion there is?! I've been better in the 2nd trimester but the only thing I could eat in the first was yogurt, orange juice and chicken. I didn't have morning sickness but was constantly nauseous and couldn't look at most foods.|`|52U22fiAaa	Wow, you had a baby 1 year after giving birth to twins!!  <br>  <br>  Ok, so yes, I am a chocoholic, but when I got pregnant I hated sweets.|`|AA10093245	yes, anything fried. Just the smell of something frying made me run to throw up.<br>  couldn't stand strong perfumes either.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	I couldn't eat french fries until I was 6 months pregnant. I threw up every time i ate even one!|`|uEo0vS7aaa	Yes, I cannot eat anything with tomato sauce, paste or juice. All of it give me indigestion. I can some sometimes eat fried foods but not more than a couple to several days apart. The baby does not like anything greasy or spicy. She doesn't even like orange juice, which make me sick on Monday. Even though this is my 4th child and I am 2 weeks away from having her, everyday is trial and error at mealtimes. She used to like New England Clam Chowder, today I couldn't even finish it for lunch. What the heck! I'm going to starve before this child gets here.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Oh yes, food aversions were always there to screw with me. I would sometime crave a certain food, and then when I had it in my face and I could smell it.. I would want to throw up. I'm 35 weeks and still like that. If I cook something, I cannot eat it! I have to eat it like the next day. And it makes it so hard when you are out at a restaurant with the smells of everything floating around, I can't make up my mind what to order.|`|ApyrV5J9aa	For me it was eggs and mushrooms, which I loved before. My husband and I like to make breakfast together on Sundays and I finally had to go buy pancake mix because I couldn't' t stand to look at eggs any more. I have also been leaving mushrooms out of all my cooking and they used to be a staple of my diet! It's crazy, I just hope I'm back to normal after the baby is here :)|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Yes, I cannot eat ANY beef. I don't even want to look at it.<br>  My pregnancy favorites are tomato soup, meatless spaghetti, pizza, meatless lasagna, basically any hot tomato product.<br>  My husband hates the beef-less trend.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	I used to always drink Dr. Pepper.  When I got pregnant the first time I couldn't stand the taste of Dr.Pepper, but I craved Coke.  Even now, 16 years later, I like Coke, but don't really like Dr. Pepper anymore.|`|1o820L3Daa	Coffee, and eggs. I used to love both. But now I cant even stand the smell or taste. But in congrats!Im due in June as well. On the 20th with my second. Its a boy!|`|LCHnUuS6aa	I hated the smell of meat, either uncooked meat, or cooked ham etc.  I was ok with cooked hot meat, just made me feel ill to prepare it.|`|AA12314337	Yup, the smell of seafood was disgusting to me!
kYkKcQJ2aa	Yep your baby is ready....locked and loaded...I didn't realized that my baby dropped but everybody around me said I did, but once the baby is engaged it is a lot harder to move around. Good Luck!|`|NMzlbWt8aa	Im pretty sure it means that she's dropped down.  Good luck... labor should be in the next weeks or so|`|kvYgopThaa	If she is engaged then yes she has dropped|`|rDw9N09iaa	congrats on the baby girl. and yes, engaged and dropping are the same thing.|`|UAU3wPC0aa	Nothing has happened..Don't worry..Do some exercise. .have faith in God..All the best. .
s4OtfZ7Gaa	i'm the same way right now. my fiance can look at me wrong and i start crying. commercials on the tv, a song on the radio, everything sets me off! there's not much you can really do about it, except know that you arent the only one and that it's a normal (though aggravating) part of pregnancy.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I think a lot of pregnant women go through the same thing. It's very frustrating when you are used to being a patient, calm person! For me, when I feel like I am about to have a meltdown, I just walk away from the situation I am in and take a few minutes for myself to either cry or breathe and relax, whatever I need to do and just let it pass. The best thing about these hormone induced breakdowns is that they usually pass as fast as they come on.<br>  <br>  Also, I have been trying to find ways to help me manage stress better in general, thus decreasing how often that happens. I've been doing prenatal yoga and meditation and getting massages. All of those help with my moods tremendously. Good luck to you. :]|`|AA11609300	The only thing that helps me keep things under control is resting.  Most of the time I feel like I'm cranky because I'm exhausted, so lying down usually helps me.<br>  GL|`|0zWJlNi1aa	It is completely normal and it will pass.  Its all those hormones!|`|Fwq3xVWXaa	It took me three or four months to get my emotions under control. what worked best for me was to just stop what I was doing and focus on something that made me laugh. It helped balance everything till I got everything under control. Hope everything works out. It always helps to know your not alone.|`|eKls7ooUaa	That is totally normal- i am pregnant with my second-and i am HIGHLY emotional.  If you are worried talk to your OB and they can prescribe you something.  It is just all those darn hormones that war going through your system. GOOD LUCK!|`|D1NhxI2iaa	It's normal..nothing really u can do about it ...|`|F6lZHRkVaa	This is very normal. If you were an emotional person before, it can be even worse. Don't stress too much. Accept your feelings and cry away whenever you need to. When you *are* happy though, be sure to tell your man how much you love him. Tease him and tell him you're apologizing in advance for how mad you'll be getting at him later. Just take a deep breath honey, this is normal and go away soon.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That's completly normal and will go away. There isn't anything you can do about them or to make them stop. It's hormonal. Sorry. :) They will taper off.
CrjozlCjaa	I wouldn't be concerned yet.    Read books with her and repeat what she says to you in a slightly expanded simple sentence.    Read books to her, with her and just keep repeating words and names of s things.  she will get there soon.  My eldest son spoke very early, second son made his first sentence at 20 months but our daghter didn't want to talk and didn't need to as her every wish was catered for by the rest of the family so she was well past two before she spoke.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	contact early intervention and ask for a speech evaluation. I am guessing that she probably has a moderate speech delay that will improve with therapy. <br>  <br>  my youngest son was just like that...He said 10 words at 24 months old, but was ahead in other areas. It turns out that he has a disorder called apraxia. EI put him in speech therapy and he turned into a different child! We were finally able to understand him, and discovered how smart and funny he is. He started out with a 12 month expressive delay, and within 12 months he was on target with pretty much everything except articulation. That means his speech improved by 2 months for every month that he was in therapy!<br>  <br>  I am sure that I will get thumbds down for it, but let her watch some preschool TV shows. My son liked to watch sesame street and wordworld, and superwhy. We quickly discovered that he knew all his ABCs, colors, shapes, etc. Noggin is another good chanell for that. If you do not like the TV idea, then talk to her as much as you can.|`|qImMwhUHaa	I actually contact the local elementary/ primary school and they did a speech evaluation on my son. He is now in speech classes. We practice saying sounds that he cannot make and play games concentrating on speech sounds. If she has all of her sounds, then everything should be okay though.<br>  <br>  2 YEARS: By age two, words should be combined into two and three-word phrases and sentences, such as "more milk", "all gone", "my turn". The child also understands "where is mommy/daddy?" and simple directions such as, "get your coat". Two year olds understand more words than they can speak. A two-year-old understands approximately 300 words.<br>  <br>  3 YEARS: A three-year-old can follow simple directions such as, “time to take a bath,” "tell him your name.” She can also put an object in, under, or on top of a table when asked. She can also answer simple questions about objects such as “which one is bigger?” By age three a child understands approximately 900 words and speaks 200 words clearly.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i have the exact same issue, i talked to the doctor and he felt that she was fine, because she communicates her needs well just without alot of words and understand questions when i ask her and is doing great in all other areas, but mentioned that the easier i make it for her not to talk the longer it will take, for example even if i know what she wants encourage her to say the word and ask for it before i give it to her. i believe reading to her helps alot, she is starting to repeat back things from her favorite stories.  also i keep hearing that too much tv can impair their language learning, so limit daily tv to a short amount of time.  as long as she continues to learn new words thats what is important.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	my daughter is 2 years old and does not use sentences...just basic words...her vocabulary is growing and it's getting easier to communicate with her...her doctor is not concerned that she's not saying sentences yet so i'm not concerned about...the most important thing to remember is to talk to her like a person...don't talk to her in baby talk...for example my daughter says 'sho sho' for shower...but instead of me saying 'sho sho' back to her i say shower...she'll get it eventaully.

foJm2Yftaa	Wait when she is in a deep sleep, then put her in her own bed. :P lol|`|gEj9GQvQaa	Beat her.|`|aFI2o7I9aa	I have heard of this happening and that's why I never let my daughter sleep with me even when it was so tempting I didn't do it. the best advice I can give you is keep trying wait until she is really sleeping then move her if she wakes up giver her a bottle and sing her back to sleep or rub her belly pat her back etc whatever calms her down, but don't move her into your bed the more you do that the more she is learning that she can get away with it its hard to enforce rules on a baby especially when your exhausted but at this age is when they start learning they have control over their environment and they will take advantage of it.|`|hhWDHmfyaa	Good luck.  I failed at this.<br>  <br>  Before parenting, I thought only child abusers had their kids in bed.  Then parenting a colic baby came.  If you add all the nights together, I think my husband spent a full year of sleep in a princess bed.  Then of course, the dog entered.<br>  <br>  By age 2 we got a California King Size Bed.  I can't remember what age she was when she finally stopped coming in to our room, but she was in elementary school.  I do remember that I did not ever really have a good night's sleep until she slept in her own bed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7ZMmQhWraa	If she is sleeping for 12 hours you should sleep when she is sleeping. Forget about when you want to sleep. If your baby is awake at night then thats when you should be awake. <br>  Family beds happen, if the only place your baby will sleep comfortably is the bed then your husband should take the couch.
2V4JHa1Saa	nice to meet a fellow tara lol well your body is under alot of stress right now and i know what is wrong cause i get them even when im not pregnant they are panic attacks and when u get dizzy and short of breath i recommend (sounds funny but works for me for the past 8yrs) stick your head in your freezer and take deep slow breaths of the cool air trust me i also have 4 sisters who have them and if u don't get them under control you can start to faint from them i first fainted at 19 about 5 years after first getting them but still i would try breathing exercises and control your stress level|`|dv3z9MyDaa	Its your bodies way of telling you that you should have waited for me.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If your doctor doesn't know we certainly won't but I hope they figure it out soon. That doesn't sound fun. Rest up and keep looking for answers.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	glad to hear you've gotten it checked out by a doc! if the cardiologist hasnt found anything, thats good. it sounds to me like you are having panic attacks! i've had them for years and was on meds for them before i got pregnant. now that i'm pregnant and cant take them it has started back. just sit down and concentrate on your breathing when it starts. that should help
6YELMQd9aa	Talk to your husband about your feelings and make sure you both stay on the same page.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	you should show them both a loving family.  giving your step daughter extra special treatment, special attention and extra 'chances' will harm her more than do good for her.  kids need boundaries.  don't soften things for her, teach your step daughter that although she's going through a lot of drama, it doesn't define her (make sure YOU dont make it define her) and she should have the same rules as your daughter.  you don't want her to always think 'poor me'.|`|wNLmGzSwaa	If, after this child is born, you become pregnant again, what will you do with your natural offspring? How will you treat them? They will be in conflict for your attention. Whatever you would do for them, you should do for your stepdaughter and her half-sister. <br>  You sound like a loving and caring mother. You'll work it out and everything will be fine.|`|t9S0dqfLaa	I think you are going to do just fine, the fact that you care shows you're going to be a great mom and step-mom.  Just treat them the same it's not as hard as it may seem to you now.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	My step-son is the same age as my oldest son, both 12, and I have a 10 yr. son as well.  The key, for me, is to not overthink things so much....if I do this will it show favortism, or if I do that will one feel left out, etc... It can drive you crazy worrying if you let it.  There WILL be conflicts, there WILL be jealousy..but there is in any family, not just the step relationship.  All 3 know that I love them and MY two know that mommy is still mommy and that they are still my world. It can be hard at times, but just relax and deal with everything without concentrating on it as "step" or "bioligical".  Good luck!

If they don't like it they either shouldn't have opened this question or at least answered it as nicely as possible rather then shoving their views in your face.

URbMCRFLaa	The spotting could be implantation bleeding. Timing seems just about right for it to be based on your last period and when you had sex. The symptoms sound identical to my symptoms when I found out I was pregnant with my son. You may be one of the women who just know they are pregnant before they miss their period. Which is fun, unfortunately though you have to play the wait and see game now. You have 10 days until you're supposed to start your period. Wait a few days and go buy one of those preg tests that tests early and I'll bet you'll see a positive! Good luck!|`|SiteIfZAaa	I'm also TTC! It looks like we are on the same schedule! You're like my TTC Twin :)<br>   According to OT my ovulation was on 27th. I had some awful sharp cramps on Mar 2nd. I don't usually have that, so I told myself it was digestion related. We'll both be anxious and waiting for March 14! I'm in the same spot as you.<br>  I'm not tracking symptoms, it makes me more stressed out about it all. And less stress is best.<br>  Best of luck, wishes and baby dust to both of us (and everyone else here)! <br>  Keep us updated|`|YGawvy8saa	your'e probs the same as me, i am trying too, i think we try and convince our selves, however, the spotting is a good sign of pregnancy and tirednes...well theres another...good luck if u are trying x x x x|`|tWFc9mTGaa	Sound very likely you are pregnant..

Until the night of my due date when I felt like the dishes in the sink were just staring at me!

So relax and try again later.<br>  <br>  Really, at 5 months, she's getting the main source of her nutrition through breast milk or formula.<br>  <br>  ETA: For practice. Unless your baby is not gaining weight then it's just for "fun" really at this age.|`|QmTCMZtgaa	My daughter is 7 1/2 months and my pediatrician suggested that I start giving her proteins at 7 months.  She said that if we don't want to give her meat, we could start with full fat yogurt.  Because I haven't decided whether or not to raise my baby vegetarian (I am), I've been giving her YoBaby yogurt and she really likes it.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	right now, you're introducing her to the world of food. it isn't for nutrition (though the foods you give her should be nutritious) so she does not need meat.<br>  <br>  i had the same issue with my daughter--the canned baby meat is the ONLY thing she had EVER spit out in disgust--and can you blame them??? it smells like cat food (my cat LOVED them, btw!). <br>  but she DID like meat, i got a food grinder & put meat that *I* would actually eat in there & she gobbled that up just like everythign else.|`|AA11540024	I have 6 months old and she doesn't seem too fond of the veggies, except sweet potatoes. It's ok if she doesn't eat it right away. Try again later. Mine is living of of baby cereal mixed with fruits and her bottles with formula and she's happy.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	"is it really safe to let her be a vegetarian for the time being"<br>  <br>  Uh, yeah.  Do you really think she's relying on those solids for any sort of nutrition?  Hopefully she's still getting tons of nursings or formula, which give her all of her nutrition.  Remember that many babies never eat any solid foods until they are much older than your baby.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Almost always it's for practice.  In some rare cases babies benefit from some cereal to help them with reflux or from solids to keep them from drinking more than 32-40 ounces of formula (yeah, some tiny babies will drink that much even though they don't need that much).  But, for most normal babies doctors say give solids early (between 4-6 months) to give babies practice getting used to them.  At the very least, babies need to have a chance to explore solids with out any pressure so that when they do actually need their nutrition they know what's up.  Usually babies don't need any nutrition besides their formula/breast milk until they are close to 12 months, and some even after that.  But, if they've never had solids before, they won't understand and won't get it.  Most of the time babies do great with just a couple "practice" months before needing to depend on solids for nutrition, but lots of people think that babies need to slowly work up to family foods.  That's why you get a lot of "they need to start on rice cereal at 4 months so they get used to a different texture, then slowly change to stage 1 foods, then to thicker stage 2 foods, and then lots of time with stage 3 foods for the chunks.  You can't just give a 7 month old table food because they'll choke because they've never had anything but milk before" type advice.  Most of it isn't really true, but that's okay.<br>  <br>  Regardless, though, nearly all solids before 9 months old are just so baby can practice, and most solids before 12 months are still just for practice, not nutrition.  The solids should be nutritious and healthy, but babies still get all of their nutrition from their breast milk or formula.|`|oAIxqdfFaa	She is too yooung right now to be started on meats. Meats are hard to digest as well. You may want to hold on to meats till she is atleast a year older. You can introduce chicken to her at the age of 10 months. <br>  Yes it is perfectly fine to start slowly on solid foods. Try fruits and vegetables first and cereals. Start with Rice Cereal then you can gradually mix banana, or apple pureee in a cereal. Ler her develop the taste first. At the age of 7 months you can introduce yogurt to her as well and you can try cheese as well. <br>  <br>  Some time kids don't eat meat but after a while they develop a taste for it. I would suggest to get fresh meat and cook it at home in a pressure cooker like a stew but more towards mashed side.|`|9ro8fiKvaa	Breastmilk/ formula will provide ALL of the nutrients that your baby needs at her age. My Dr told me that I could start introducing cereal at 6 months and then start SLOWLY with pureed veggies & fruits. Meat is not a concern this early on. She is getting all of the iron and protien that she needs from the breastmilk/formula. Besides, her little digestive system may not be able to handle meat very well at this early age.|`|UXhFcHCHaa	i am answering your second part of the question. the dr said to start her to get her used to eating soilds so you can transition her easier to table foods. there are stage 1, stage 2 which are a little thicker and chunkier and stage 3 has pieces of meats and like noodles. by stage 3 she should be ready for table food.
277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	i love them, they are a little bit more of a pain than disposables, but oh so much better on butt.  they breath.  to go out in public you might want to take some ziplock baggies to put the liner into if baby poops.  unless you're going to wash it in the sink.  i would suggest having at least 4 of the g pants, and at least 6 liners.  to get poop stains off the liners, it really helps to have a lidded bucket with oxiclean and water.  it made some of mine look new again.  i just let them soak for awhile.  you can buy the g pants online at the website.  or buy starter kits, they'll have 2 g pants (one vanilla bean and one orange), four liners and 10 refills.  i know babies r us has them.  you can buy the refills online at amazon.com for cheaper than on gdiapers or in any store i've found so far.  and it's free shipping. a problem i've had is the velcro getting worn.  i've put snaps on and they seem to work fine and they're not much more difficult. i put one female and two male per side so it can still be adjusted. on the side against his skin i put a piece of fabric over so the metal is not on his skin. i found the snaps at walmart.  hope this helps!  good luck|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I use gdiapers in combo with cloth and disposable.  I like them, but of the three, a big poop is the worst in a gdiaper.<br>  <br>  Buy the starter pack and try them out.  It's hard to imagine using them exclusively though.|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	I bought  the starter set and I like them I wasn't sure if I would  but I decided to try since if I didn't like them I could sell the covers then I wouldn't be out much money.

That's about all I know though.<br>  <br>  <br>  We are planning on using reuseable diapers (cloth) but G Diapers you have to keep buying the refills for so we decided to go with Bumgenius diapers, Happy Heiney diapers and Blueberry diapers instead, so we don't have to keep buying more stuff.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	We do cloth diapers.  I looked into G Diapers, and they are expensive!  Way more expensive than even the fanciest cloth diapers.  They also seem like a lot more work (even than cloth).  I would suggest checking out some of the nice cloth diapers (such as Fuzzi Bunz or BumGenius) before you go for the G Diapers.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I do not use them. I use cloth diapers, but I have heard that G diapers are a good alternative. Like I said, I have never used them, so I don't know exactly what you need, or how well they work. I know they have them at babiesrus.com. You should be able to find out there what all you need.|`|AiJeS6I1aa	<a href="http://www.gdiapers.com/gdiapers101" rel="nofollow">http://www.gdiapers.com/gdiapers101</a><br>  <br>  I have the starter pack and tried the gDiaper for a little while.  I'm not really a big fan, and even though I still have inserts left over, I tend not to reach for them.  I much prefer my cloth diapers.  I use Mother-Ease fitted diapers with a cover - I RARELY have a leak with this system.<br>  <br>  It's kind of hard to get a good fit with the gDiaper because you need to get the edges of the waterproof liner to sit in the leg creases (where underwear would sit).  I find this bunches the diaper too much between the legs.  The waterproof liner leaves red marks all over my babe's sensitive skin!  I also think that even though there is a stretchy waistband, my babe looks uncomfortable in it... perhaps because she has such a buddha-belly!  lol<br>  <br>  As for leaks, I had some with initial use until I perfected the fit.  I've had a few more leaks with large, runny poos.<br>  <br>  Some people I've talked to really like the gDiaper.  I'd give it a 3 out of 5.  I'll use what I have, but when they're gone, no more.<br>  <br>  Try cloth.  It's easy, and inexpensive compared to disposables and those costly insert refills for the gDiaper.  One other option would be to use cloth inserts in the gDiaper.  You could use newborn prefolds or a diaper doubler.  You may have to experiment a bit.  I know of one small company that specifically makes cloth inserts to fit in the gDiaper (The Nappy Shoppe).

Chores are ok.  Having your children take care of your other children, not OK.  Courtesy and respect and wanting to help out once in awhile with the kids is fine, but everyday....I do not think so.  My kids are not expected to care for each other.  Occasionally they will grab a drink for the other or make a sandwich for the other. Maybe once in a blue moon help with homework.  But never everyday care.|`|77NzfiVkaa	I think the 12 year olds are fine but the 14 year old shouldn't have to bathe the children and the 17 year old shouldn't have to cook dinner and feed the children in the morning. Are you the mother? What are you doing? What is your husband doing besides washing windows once a month? You need to step in and take care of your own household.|`|nKSmgjylaa	You're the adult. You should bathe, feed, iron, take out trash, etc. They are YOUR children. Seriously, the kids should be out with friends having fun and enjoying their childhoods, not acting like adults. Why have so many kids if you can't control them all? <br>  <br>  What role do you play?|`|su37vnIXaa	And so what exactly do you do? sit on your butt & watch them?|`|LLeQyWGcaa	maybe a little much for the 17 year old. all the chores are teachings of what life is really like. they also teach responsibility. It is nice that everyone has their chores and are helping the family out.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Gosh, what do YOU do?<br>  <br>  I think that the 12 year old's chores are fine.<br>  <br>  I think that the 14 year old can handle all but folding the laundry (a chore <I> despise and would not make a child do) and I do not think either sister should have to wash the younger siblings.<br>  <br>  I think that the 17 year old should not have to iron, and should not have to dust and as I said above, should not have to wash the younger siblings.<br>  <br>  I have a friend with ten children-she manages.  The older children help, but are not slaves.  I think you are requiring too much of your older children.  I believe in helping out, but they need to be children as well.  They did not choose to have such a large family, you did. <br>  <br>  How old are the other 7 you do not mention?  Septuplets, I bet?  .|`|HchGJp3oaa	The 12 yr old is fine but I don't think the 14 yr old should Bathe their little brothers and sister and I don't think The 17 yr old should cook|`|PUUXbVK2aa	me and my sister have to do all that, except cleaning the windows, ironing and we don't have any little siblings.<br>  <br>  and we don't have a dishwasher, we have to wash the dishes BY HAND.<br>  <br>  <br>  It really doesn't seem like too much.<br>  <br>  None of it is intense hard work.|`|aJEsKQHNaa	The 12 year-old should not have to take the trash out. You can do something like that you know. <br>  <br>  The 14 and 17 year-old should not have to bathe the younger ones you should do that. <br>  <br>  The 17 year-old should not have to wake the younger ones or get them dressed.|`|3URupc7caa	So what do you do as the mother :s sit there and watch your kids look after your other kids..isnt that your job!|`|QGP930C6aa	please dnt take this offensivly but if you cant look after that many kids you shouldnt have had so many ---- if they are happy to do it then thats fine but make sure they arent missing out on any time they could be havin fun with there friends or bein a second parent to your kids|`|paHjJrrdaa	No that all sounds about right.  Not sure on having to bathe the younger ones, that's kind of an adult job.  But with 5 kids I'm sure you parents need all the help they can get.  And if you guys are sticking to this all I have to say is good job!!  It's really good to see a family come together and work together like this.  It's all about helping one another and your family seems to have that down! Good job!<br>  <br>  Edit: If there are more than 5 like we assume by your question, what are all the other kids doing to help out? If they are over the age of 5 they can help out to starting with simple little tasks like keeping their room clean and making their beds. <br>  Why only give chores to 3 of them?|`|pDGVTLoFaa	No it is not too much at all a family has to pull together and do chores,you will appreciate doing this when you have a home of your own one day.x|`|U3jS5k9eaa	I personally agree with children helping with chores but i do feel that these children are doing too many. I think they should all keep their rooms clean and help out with the filling of the dish washer but not to really clean windows or iron. I also agree that the older children should help out with the younger children but i don't think it should have to be a chore or them having to do it every day/evening.|`|Dl9MJKf1aa	I understand how difficult it is to live in a large family. I know that some people here will say that this is way too much for children but honestly, if they are happy and healthy and have enough free time and homework time then it's absolutely fine. :)<br>  Between 10-13 I had easy jobs such as putting the rubbish away, cleaning my room, setting the table and wiping it after dinner, helping in the garden and washing the car... but gradually I had to help out further like cleaning the house and cooking dinner. It wasn't so bad.<br>  I think that this is fair and the chores aren't really that bad as people make them to be.|`|MNl2HmXRaa	Sounds good except the 17 y/o seems to have a lot on her plate.  She should be hanging out with friends or looking for a p/t job so she can have money for spending.|`|xMy0QEvFaa	No, your not giving your kids to many chores to do and it's not like they are very hard to do.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about it.|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	It may seem like a lot of work, but you 3 are learning a good work ethic. You will be better adults as a result.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I think thats fine. Teaches them responsibility. They will probably be wonderful giving people when they get older because of it. My daughter is 4 and trying to get her to do anything is a nightmare! Just recently I got her to put her dirty clothes in the hamper. We are working on picking up after herself and placing youe dirty dishes int eh sink when finished.|`|4mCB14Vbaa	You shouldn't let a 14 year old bathe children for safety reasons,<br>  The 17 year old has too much work, they should help cooking, washing and help the younger children get dressed and thats it.<br>  Why have 12 kids if you can't look after them?|`|kdBxtEdcaa	Not at all.<br>  It is good training that will put them in good stead for when they have children to bring up.<br>  Incidentally, why don't you make them physically wash and dry the dishes instead of wasting electricty? It won't do them any harm.|`|g0xB8Z1Oaa	twelve kids? are you nuts?|`|iojRLiBGaa	Yes it's too much, far too much.<br>  You are a mother no? What are you doing in all of this, or your husband? I cannot see any more chores that need doing. Dishes etc i can understand, but the rest is too much.<br>  If you can't take all the work, you shouldn't of had so many kids.|`|b326b96181c4a84b24f503115e014b7daa	No. Not at all. When these kids grow up and have their own home...they get to do all those by themselvs. And I also think its good to teach how to care for a family at this age so that they think twice about having unprotected sex, or even have sex before they are ready.|`|aRkYiXtGaa	sounds ok to me, I wish my children would have been so helpful|`|KNxs4PrZaa	the 12 year old seems just about right, the other two it would depend on how often they have to do those things, if a 17 year old is expected to help dress and feed two little kids and bathe them at night and do cleaning and washing in between on a daily basis then i think you are asking alot from her.  if those are just an example of the things that you ask from her occasionaly then i think thats just fine, those are all reasonable chores for kids i would say it the amount of time they have to spend doing them a day is whats important.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	the younger kids should not be bathing two and three yr olds. I would NEVER let a 14 yr old bathe my daughter maybe to be in the bathroom just to kinda talk to the kids and calm them down yes but not to wash their hair or their bodies or anything like that she's a kid herself and not strong enough to help these kids like that they could fall and bump their heads thats dangerous. <br>  <br>  <br>   the 17 yr old also no shouldn't be handeling little kids thats the moms job ONLY and shouldn't have to dress or feed them that's the moms job you had those kids not her! they're your responsibility not hers.<br>  <br>  what does your husband do sounds like the kids are working their butts off cleaning cooking taking care of YOUR other kids and husband does what?? I'm sure he works and all and must be tired but your kids go to school and all and are tired too so that's not fair! at all!|`|ISbCiVjGaa	I think making them bath the kids and helping them get dressed is quite a task for them. Maybe its my opioion but washing up etc is one thing, MAKING them look after the younger ones is just kind of bad|`|AA11296427	I have to do all that the 12 year old has to do, plus the cooking AND pick up my 6 year old sister up from school every day.<br>  <br>  Stop complaining and HELP.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|iCexBHclaa	do they get money?<br>  do you feed them and let them <br>  stay in your house.<br>  if yes then you are fine.<br>  if no then they have to many chores.|`|mSJwKrQIaa	I do all of that and I'm 16. (: I don't think it's a lot... <br>  <br>  Everyday:<br>  -I have to fold laundry<br>  -Put the wash on, put things in the dryer<br>  -Put my two brothers in the bath<br>  -Empty the dishwasher/ Fill it up<br>  -Clean my room <br>  -Hoover (upstairs and downstairs)<br>  -Help make dinner<br>  -Help get them dressed and fed in the morning<br>  -Put them to bed <br>  -Tidy up the conservatory (toy room)<br>  -Walk the dog<br>  -Set the table/ clean the table<br>  -Take the trash out<br>  AND<br>  -Help them with their homework.<br>  <br>  And i still find time to do my work and go out... I don't think it's THAT much.. but i would like to have more time to do other stuff.. <br>  <br>  Yasmine <3|`|Cj600rJDaa	I think they're fine, just make sure that you also get to have your own time to squeeze in after/during the process of your chores.|`|qEfJvQBWaa	well the 17 year old has A LOT of chores! especially when she should be planning for HER future and not helping out too much but of course she should have a little bit of chores i say she should have half of those chores on that list shes only a 17 year old you gotta cut her some slack<br>  that 12 year old should have about one  less chore <br>  besides making the bed is no big deal only if you have company over non of them should have to do that every day if there room is clean<br>  i ave a big family myself i have 8 people in my family i know how it is.|`|SUPLWOZeaa	Not really.<br>  minee?<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Al1WJoB0nANQW0uW1GzthkogBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090304115944AAcsjlS">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  x|`|TK1jVIkzaa	The 17 year old maybe has a bit much and might get overloaded. Just a thought. See how they deal.<br>  <br>  The other two sound fair.|`|ttIsK3j3aa	well the 17 yr old has it rough! i guess the 12 yr old is ok and so is the 14 yr old except the whole bathing siblings thing<br>  <br>  BTW making your bed isn't a chore....I mean c'mon!|`|VlygJOJuaa	ha nooo what youve done good separating all the chore through out the children im 15 and my mother makes me do all those chores and more and my brother is 11 and does nothing. he is not even self efficient it drives me through the wall. but if the kids are complaining tell them it could always be worse and our teaching them how to be independent. thanks to all my chores im practically my brothers and sisters second mom, though my mo does alot of work the the work and never complains.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	The 17 year old is a bit much and they should not have to bathe the younger children. Your the mother not them!|`|HI9jZSObaa	i honestly think you shouldnt have had that many kids if you knew that you werent going to take care of them all yourself. the 14 and 17 year old shouldnt be playing mommy and taking care of your kids. its unfair they deserve to have a life being a kid instead of rushing into parenthood basically. i think its very selfish when women do this because theyre not the ones taking care of the kids, the older kids are. i know kids need chores but not doing your job. cleaning the house and helping out yes but not playing mom.|`|LYzoDFV6aa	No and they probally will. If there dont do house work now then they will not be good when they are older. Its actually not much|`|hdagyZ6Taa	Sounds to me like they get to divide the load i get all of that and more to do myself and im 16<br>  but you(kids) have to understand that these chores prep u for the work you will have to do in real life not meaning u will be cleaning but it gives u work ethic. also since u dont pay rent/morgage id considering earning my keep and not feeling like a free loader =D hope my answer helps u =D gl to u|`|OGLOz9VUaa	Children aren't slaves!|`|c2JialgJaa	I don't think so.  <br>  <br>  I only have two kids and they have chores similar to yours.<br>  <br>  8 yr old - unload dishwasher, wipe off counter and stove, wipe off kitchen table, sweep and mop kitchen and hall.<br>  <br>  11 yr old - load dishwasher - wipe off sink in bath room and table in living room, sweep and mop bath room and livingroom|`|AA11242825	yes way too much sorry to say it but theyre still kids, let them enjoy it theyre gonna have to do all that one day when they are older!|`|Ta7EMhTYaa	No i don't think it's too much to ask! I did washing up, cooking, clothes washing, tidying etc at 14. and it didn't get in the way of exams and stuff. <br>  Except i think its your responsibility to bath the young children. <br>  And give them praise and encouragement.<br>  I think giving them responsibility like that is good for them|`|xgCPwhVyaa	make sure the oldest doesn't feel over worked.<br>  otherwise, not too much.|`|2BatkpPtaa	for the 17 yr old its quite a bit<br>  <br>  but the 12 and 14 year old have it easy!!|`|eXzUJbQJaa	wow thats a lot, yes it is too many,|`|xHlcnkgWaa	I don't mean to be rude, but the seventeen year old is doing way too much, dusting and vacuuming, washing and ironing? Everyday?<br>  <br>  That's a bit harsh considering she is helping you with the younger kids in the morning.|`|kgkjKNE1aa	no i dont think it is to much|`|S9sZawG2aa	Hmm... well since you have 12 kids it makes sense that the older ones have so many chores. Maybe you should take ironing off the 17 year olds list though. I mean, is that really ncessary? I can't remember the last time anything of mine was ironed lol.|`|3lNxhvQ4aa	I have a 17 and 12 yr old both boys the eldest doe's the dishes,keeps his room clean which includes changing his bed washing the floor etc,the youngest hoovers the livingroom keeps his room clean same chores there as eldest,the eldest cooks dinner from time to time he also works same as me they have a dog which is a big responsibility their choice we have endless arguements about them not looking after the dog as they should and some times about chores not getting done which is normal,I dont think your asking too much of your children they are old enough to give you a hand and when they get a place of their own they will have to do that and more,Ive always taught my sons if your big enough to make a mess your big enough to clean it up,my eldestcan aslo work the washing machine and iron,my youngest can sew and do general cooking,their father died 7yrs ago and I have 2 jobs and need a hand around the house so no your not asking to much of your kids|`|5cac3c2d6bf93a7853355873685e3384aa	no..... its called responsibility and it helps teach you to work at a early age.... I'll do the same for  my kids when I have them someday... hopefully your parents are paying an allowance for this.... that teaches kids to work for their money. <br>  <br>  Those chores seem like they are perfectly fine for me...|`|OeQ32mWyaa	Personally I think that you should go a bit easier on the 17 year old by splitting the chores between the 12 year old.

What about the Parents? Sure, dad cleans the windows once a moneth, but kids arnt slaves. Which one are you?|`|xsuR8VJqaa	I don't think that's necessarily too much to do from time to time, but if they're expected to do all this ALL the time, it's a little much. At 12, 14 and 17, they've probably got a lot of homework to do, and the 17 year-old will probably be thinking about college, too. So she'll have applications to fill out, scholarships, and possibly even a part-time job. <br>  <br>  I mean, if the kids are just usually lazy or they don't have any other activities outside school, then yeah, it's fine. I'm 20 now, an I always helped cook and clean at my house when I was younger, and still do when I come home on weekends. But I do sometimes get a little resentful if I noticeably do more than my parents in terms of housework. I know they work and support the family, and it's not right to be resentful, but sometimes it can't really be helped, you know?<br>  <br>  I think maybe cut things back a little. Of course, make them keep rooms clean, beds made, etc. But parents should bathe the younger kids, unless they're just very overloaded on work, and then can ask for help every now and then. And i don't think that all the laundry responsibility should rest with the kids. Again, it can be something they can do when parents are in a bind or better yet...do what my parents did and use chores as punishment when they do something wrong for smart off.
7RH1WmWOaa	It could be too early, how far along are you? They should be able to see a heartbeat around the 6th week on ultrasound. It could be that you have a blight ovum, which would still give you a positive test, but no fetus grows. I'd go back and have another ultrasound in a few weeks to double check.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	It might be to early to see anything.  but it is kind of odd that the urine and blood test came back positive and the u/s shows nothing.  Did you have any bleeding at all?  Blood tests will still show positive even if a miscarriage had occured|`|wqchA8B7aa	I'ts probably just too early. Don't worry until you can't see it at 4 months.|`|Wps4XuqHaa	Its most likely just way to early to see anythin!!
tcHkn0VIaa	If you have not missed your period yet then it is really too early to read into any of the other symptoms. If you think you should have your period or may be late take a HPT then if it is negative I would wait another week then take a second one. I had a discharge that felt like my period but it was clear and that happened right around the time my period was supposed to come- That was my earliest sign as well as exhaustion, and breast tenderness. the morning sickness came in at about week six. Good luck to you|`|CIZjK2rAaa	It is possible that you are, but don't get your hopes up.  I always felt that way when my period was due because I wanted to be pregnant so badly.<br>  Try taking a first response pregnancy test with first morning urine and hopefully you will see those 2 beautiful lines!|`|1ikl5q97aa	sounds like some of the signs :) but wait until you've missed your period , you can take the first response 5 days before your missed period and its suppose to be able to detect it but you should wait a few days after and take that test or go to the doctor if you are trying to have a baby because if you find out you are pregnant there then from that day forward they will set up appointments with you and ultra sounds .|`|dY5fM2vTaa	wait till after you have for sure missed your period just by a early test to have around and about a week or two after your missed period then test.|`|DMsjoZwSaa	...Take some Pepto?|`|VQuCocFnaa	buy a pregnact test.|`|rUyYEc9Vaa	take a test asap the sooner you find out the better you could not be(doubt it)but if u arnt the sooner u try again the closer u r 2 a baby;)
1G97OBNEaa	No i don't think it is as stupid.  Women need to know other women's opinions and personal experiences even though everyone is different.  It just gives them some thing (warning signs) tha they can look out for.  When girls ask if they are pregnant....now that's a bit silly because only a pregnancy test can determine that....but again I think they are just looking for some insight due to the fact that I'm sure they are nervous or whatever.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I think it depends on the details of the question. If it was very vague, very early labor symptoms, then I definitely agree. But if it is a question where people are sort of unsure whether what they are experiencing or not is real labor, that I can understand, especially for first time moms. But I guess those are two different types of questions.|`|s1utniuvaa	It depends on the question. I wish they had this site when I was pregnant with my second because I didn't know what to expect at all with labor. My first I had no pain... I tummy just kept getting really hard so my mom called my dr and he had her rush me to the hospital and they induced me... I was 16. I didn't know what to expect with my daughter. I didn't know when I was in labor. I would be in so much pain and go to the hospital just to be sent home. The last time they sent me home I was back in 3 hours via ambulance with her head coming out on my way into the delivery room. I had no one to help me and that is what a lot of women/girls on here are looking for.|`|04kOtcGgaa	i dont' think it's stupid. i'm 35 weeks and everything points to labor soon and i'd like to know from women that have gone through it already to tell me what they think of my situation. and tell me what happened to them when they had there babies. i'd also like to hear what other women who know about my situation to tell me what they think. i get comfort from it and it helps me know what to tell my doctor. i'm 16 and this is my first baby and i have no idea about anything. and i'm scared so asking a question like what do think is labor soon? and then explaining my situatio and hearing what people think and their experiances helps me alot.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	I think it is pretty dumb to ask " could i be pregnant?" If they ask then they most likely think they are.lol. I was so nervous about going into labor with my daughter. But i was so ready. I wanted to know how to get her out.lol. Not when will she come out.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	U are smart that's y. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  It's called live life..enjoy the moment! (what I wanna say...)|`|BO28Mn8haa	yum.
tdNfQWaAaa	I would think that you have already ovulated. Some women can't get accurate results with ovulation kits. Myself included. I asked my doctor why I never got a positve one month, then the next month it said I ovulated for a week. He said that some women just always have a to high or to low LH level to ever get accurate results and not to waste your money. He suggested to me to just track each cycle super close and watch for cervical mucus. He said that tracking your temp will only show you when you have ovulated and not when your about too. I hope this helped a little. Baby dust!!!!! xxxx|`|2f6diQBiaa	Could be...sometimes women have short LH surges that cannot be detected on ovulation tests. I would baby dance just in case. Good luck and lots of baby dust!!!

URbMCRFLaa	Since you didn't start your birth control on the first day of your period, you weren't covered that month by it. You had sex that night and since sperm can live up to like 7 days, you could've had some alive when you ovulated (depending when you ovulate). Could be pregnant but would have more of a chance if you had unprotected sex more than just that night. Maybe that whole week, if you did, you really might be pregnant then. Either way, you've got some waiting time before you can test and find out. Good luck!|`|stRWElvPaa	well, usually you don't ovulate the day that you stop the pill..so if you only had sex that night I would say the chances are low. start baby dancing in a couple of days from now, because a lot of people ovulate 2 to 4 weeks after they stop the pill. good luck!!<br>    ps you can track your temperature on fertilityfriend.com to make sure you are ovulating, and what about looking for ovulation predictor kits on ebay? good luck again!
871ea50d251ea84b03eb405148721ecbaa	well the first time I logged on I couldn't see anything for that huge Piczo ad, so I tried again and I feel it has too many things going on, a bit busy if you know what I mean, but I see you still have my poetry on the site and it has improved a lot since you first started. Just try to tame down the ads.|`|tlUqwZ74aa	too much stuff. very noisy/confusing. simplify it a little|`|HKKu4CjEaa	I liked your site a lot!  I fed your ciber dog about four snacks.  That was tight to death the way he followed me left and right and looked wherever I went and got really frisky while moving his mouth when I picked up a treat!  It looks fine to me.  Why change anything?|`|CdJtH0xdaa	I'll take a look.|`|Jyj09cuJaa	I did. I like Twilight but not Anime (idk how to spell that)but yeah i guess it's cool but i'm not into it!|`|dNL4n2oGaa	Ok gosh!|`|IzUlc3LNaa	Well it depends on what you want it to come across as. If you want to come off as what is it anime? Then just leave it. If you want more of a teenage normal, girlish theme than Id simplify it. Put some sparkly stickers on there like the famous Piggly Wiggly head! Or maybe some fun sayings in rainbow colors, like (my fave) "Who needs Abercrombie, when you have Prada?" And put everything in light pastels, for a girlish look. Now if you want something more sophisticated then the back ground needs to be a light charcoal, I would make the text loopy and in a white or light light color. Make it very simple, get the point across in a minimalistic way, and make it streamline and Sleek, just let it flow.|`|cdAQZJGpaa	ok i will try to look at it!
AA11109587	Sheesh!!!  That's a tough one.  Meeting or getting to know the aunt and grandma might bring dad back into the picture.  Would that be okay?  It's hard to punish the them simply because his dad wanted nothing to do with him.  I'm sure they would like to see him and get to know him, that's only natural.  He's 13 though.  Since you have always been honest, keep doing so and let him decide.  Are they good people?  If they are anything like dad, (I'm not saying he's a bad person, but he's not the Greatest Dad obviously)  I would keep this one to myself. <br>  <br>  Ask yourself this question..............Would you be upset or uncomfortable with him getting to know them and possibly even liking them? <br>  If so, then don't tell him.  If you think it would enrich his life, tell him.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	I'd wait until he expresses some interest in tracking down his biological relatives -- then you can "just happen" to stumble upon the information, and take it from there.  Adding all these new people into his life is going to bring up a lot of confusing, conflicting emotions in him -- people have enough trouble trying to make sense of it all at 33, let alone 13.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	wow thats kind of tough maybe you should try contacting them first, if they want to talk to him then let it all be on him don't let him do it first they might break his heart and ignore him or say something mean to him like that they don't wanna hear from him. anything is possible you know. butttt you know them better than we or he does if you think they'd be rude and snobby it's only up to you to contact them first not your son so he doesn't have to go through them maybe rejecting him|`|Jo8nlGVsaa	Yes and No. It depends on rather they want anything to do with him. If they want to be apart of his life, then yes tell him! If not then forget it, you don't want to upset him ext.|`|h6M6v58jaa	I would let him know and then have him make the decision on his own.|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well i think you should  tell him  he needs to know|`|qo8SalPIaa	Well I can - in a way- place myself in his shoes. Im 30 and I do not know my biological father. I had always been told that the man who was my father was deceased.Even when I saw a picture of his familt when I was 17, I questioned it again and my mother still insisted that he was my father, and did not want to help me in contacting them. Now at 30, my mother is trying to search for my father. Yes it was wrong for her to hold that information from me. I wished she would have been able to contact my fathers family prior to me asking and then allow me to make the choice in whether I wanted to meet them or not. I still do not know that if he or his family would want anything to do with me or even know about me. As a 30 year old, I STILL dont know how I would handle it if they didnt accept me. Im just grateful that I havent had any sort of health issues ( such as a bone marrow transplant or a blood transfusion) or hidden health issues caused by his genes in which would have required me to contact them.  Honestly, find out if his family would want anything to do with him FIRST. If they accept him with open arms, then let him know that you found them. Regardless if his father wants nothing to do with him or even if his dad has said that his FAMILY wants nothing to do with your son, at least TRY to contact them and ask them personally. Just becasue his dad may not want him in his life, does not mean that his family feels the same. As long as you have been truthful with him thats what counts. If he has a dad in his life now and has a positive role model, thats even better!  Good luck on this!!!

z6IekuwSaa	I would say yes. But even if you don't, if you start nursing or pumping you can relactate|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	yeah...I had a lot of milk for 3-4 weeks and now 5 months later if I squeeze a little still comes out..just a drop though|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  I believe you still have milk but it is drying out.  It takes at least one month to totally dry out.<br>  Therefore, you will notice a leak or two in your bra.<br>  Use pads or Kleenex so that it does not smell your bra up.|`|lD0VcAlpaa	Most likely, yes though your supply has probably dropped. You'll want to hydrate a lot (a bottle of water every 2 hours and a bottle of water after every feeding), eat those additional 500 calories and relax when feeding, if you'd like to resume breastfeeding that is, anyways.|`|jjQOvFyzaa	most likely yes..nurse ALOT and for as long as the baby wants to stimulate your breasts so they tell your body you need the milk (hormones are sent etc) the more you nurse the more milk will come dnt get frustrated when you dnt have enough to satisfy your baby...goodluck|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	Chances are YES !  <br>  You can still nurse. <br>   Put the baby to the breast every 2 hours and drink a glass of water every hour :)<br>  <br>  Many people have gone back to it after finding how upset their baby was on formula|`|9ro8fiKvaa	You haven't gone through the agony of weaning your child off of the breast if you don't feel like your breasts are about to explode with pain!!! I had my daughter down to one feeding per day and then cut her off after she had turned 1yr old. The pain was so bad for me that I had to go into the bathroom at work and squeeze my breasts until milk squirted into the toilet! I did this for a few days and although my breasts were still quite full the pain slowly subsided. Sorry for the long explanation but my answer is that if breastfeeding went fine for you then at this point, yes, you should still have milk in your breasts.|`|bf6fb0f4caadf24cfa826edc2cc32d3baa	very possible
zxQT3Uo5aa	Not really, this is hopeful for the 14 year old.  If mother is the problem and child has to live with her, the problem hasn't been solved but deferred.|`|AA11210211	Be supportive of her yes it is very say that a child so young is in rehab but it is better that she gets it taken car of while she is still young.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	its sad that your friend couldnt control herself.  its good that her mom is trying to fix things - but ultimately its up to your friend.  just learn from it and don't go down that path with her if that's where she chooses to take herself.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	yeah that is pretty sad.. but offer to be there for your friend and help her instead of ridiculing her. Also let this be a lesson to you and your friends.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Atleast she's getting help. That's better than continuing with her habits. Stop judging, especially when you don't even know her.|`|T864ejaiaa	sad. i guess she needs to watch wh she hangs with when she gets out.|`|JM1kBBGraa	that's not sad it's embarresing. it's her fault that she did whatever she did to go to rehab. her mom got tired and sent her. not sad at all. it's her fault she messed up and got to rehab.|`|zHRWklEWaa	It is sad she got into unhealthy habits to begin with, it is a good thing she is getting help for it.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	Quit judging and offer help.|`|hNIof0lbaa	Wow...that is sad.

I think babies should be babies. Shes cute. But I don't know if she would have the look that some agencies might want. Look up talent agencies in the yellow pages or something.|`|CmG8oTH0aa	She looks a little young to be doing drugs.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I dont watch Nip/Tuck alot, but did catch the episode where a mom injected her daughter will collagen - her 1 year old daughter - to get a modeling gig, becuase the casting agents told her the babies lips weren't pouty enough.  <br>  <br>  And then I thought how much I couldnt wait to expose my children to those types of people, those pageant people are bad enough with their toddler spray tans and leg shaving.
bQTATDTyaa	He's found a new skill. They go through this phase, it's part of them learning how their body works and being in control of themselves. <br>  <br>  How do you react? If you make an issue of it then it will probably get worse, he thinks it's funny probably. Try ignoring it and it will pass. Just wipe him off like nothing happened and move on.<br>  <br>  It could also be a sore throat or upset tummy and he is responding to being uncomfortable.|`|AA10186411	My daughter does this!  Not as much as she used to, but I did pick her up from daycare the other day and she had on her extra clothes, and I was told she had made herself vomit twice.  I askd the doctor months ago, and he said that she probably doesn't mean to.  She just has a very weak gag reflex, and just sticking them in to far makes her vomit.  But if you would feel better, you could always ask the doctor!|`|oiJITSNZaa	They may be trying to chew through their teeth way back in there and get their fingers in too far. I probably wouldn't worry about it unless its a continual occurrence. And at his check up I would mention it to the doctor just to be on the safe side. Good Luck!|`|d2a0585e74c3d9f7847ec51a8b4d0848aa	It's just a phase. Babies like to do it because it feels good to gag and he probably doesn't realise shes taking it too far before he throws up. It will stop when he gets bored ofi t|`|xpvFbcJqaa	My son does this too he's 17 months old.<br>  <br>  It's pretty annoying and yucky I don't know why they do that!<br>  <br>  Silly babies!
b99kfMPcaa	You are so incredibly lucky!!  My son is now 30 months old (2.5 years) and still refuses to use the potty.  He has pooped a couple of times, but absolutely will not pee in it.  The only advice that I got was to take him to the potty every half an hour, whether he has to go or not.  That way he understands the "feeling" of got-to-go.  If you really have that much time to devote to potty training, I would set a timer and take him every half an hour for a few days and see how he does.  Backing a success up with a reward is also helpful, as it makes them want to hold it until they go to the potty, just so they get the reward.  <br>  <br>  I don't think being without a diaper would take longer per say, but it might make for more messes and more laundry.  But if you are faithful at taking him every half an hour you might not have to worry so much about the mess if he has an accident.  Try explaining to him that by wearing underwear and not a diaper means he is now a big boy and has to use the potty.  Good luck mom!!|`|ATyHswTTaa	My mum had myself and my sister potty trained at that time also, if have signs interest keep letting him use the potty.. if havent already change the nappies for pull ups, show he is big boy now, leave pottys in easy reach for him ie. kitchen or sitting room. also there musical potty chair that can be bought, every time pee's into it, plays a music, might encourage him more just to hear the music play.. 20-30mins after he takes a drink ask him to sit on potty for wee bit, as found with my son he would pee that time after a drink.. give him treat also for usen it, this encourage him more.. better have him potty trained then no interest to do so.. i wish u luck..|`|p07RwZK2aa	21 months is a good time if he's ready. That's great that he's recognising the need to pee without you telling him! That alone shows that he's ready. <br>  <br>  Definitely take off his diaper and put him in 'big boy's' underwear. Make a big deal out of this - let him choose his own and tell him that he has to try and keep it dry. If you use diapers or pull-ups, he can just pee in it as usual and won't understand the horrible feeling of wetting himself. <br>  <br>  Lock yourselves indoors for a few days to get the hang of it indoors. I gave my son lots to drink to give us lots of practise peeing. Then I just asked him every hour if he needed to pee. Also watch out for signs of needing to pee (wriggling, holding himself, doing the potty dance etc) and then whisk him onto the potty. <br>  <br>  Be prepared for lots of accidents. But be consistent. Don't give up. Give it a week and then he should have got the hang of it. When you venture outdoors, just make sure he pees before leaving home, and make sure that you have a bathroom stop at least every hour and keep asking him if he needs to pee. <br>  <br>  Also... your son will backtrack when the baby is born. I had a baby 3 months ago and my son was 3 years old. Since then he has had many more peeing accidents during the day, but he is starting to improve again. At least if you start now you will have a basis to work on even if he gets worse again after the baby is born. But definitely start now and don't wait until you have a newborn to look after as well. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i would follow his lead, you will be having a baby soon and if he isnt really ready and oyu try to have him fully trained you could end up with a lot of accidents and unnecessary frusteration.  but keep letting him try when he wants to and encouraging him when he does, he is still young so he may go back and forth between wanting to pee in the potty and wear diapers and just go with the flow.  pushing it to soon can really turn him off to it.|`|e93659642a9147aad2a89d7b0a52ebddaa	do not use pullups! they are the worst for potty training. it is great that he understands pee and what it means. buy him some big-boy underware and get a pair of those rubber pants things used for cloth diapers. put the underware on and the rubber ones over them. if he pees in his pants he will feel it and understand that he is making a mess and needs to use the potty. and the rubber pants will help make less of amess for mom to clean up. but pullups prevent kids from feeling the difference in diapers or underware.|`|tGdtntmLaa	i have now potty trained both my daughters,and was a nursery nurse for 11 yrs, and i find that u need to have the time and dont expect anything to soon,it can take anything from 1wk to 12mths, i first potty trained my daughter when she was 19mths which was early too, but she took to it like a dream, was potty trained after a wk, dry through the nite after 2 wks, very lucky, i took a wk off work to do an intence wk with her, no pants just let her run round the house with no bottoms for the first 2 days,so she could get staright on how ever many times she wanted,then i introduced pants on the third day, still no trousers,i just kept with her all day, and kepted reminding her, i dont recommend pull ups, they are to confusing. i only used them as bed time pants. if ur son is interested good signs are good lanuage,shows interest,understands instructions,. if i was u i would either do it now,as it might be very hard once baby comes, or wait till u have the baby and have the time again, dont rush it has it can make the process longer, if u keep trying and stopping. i ve just dont my second daughter, but i waited till after i had the time, as i had a weding to plan, and didnt want her and me getting stresses. so pick your time when u are both ready, it takes alot of time and patients .|`|tjXF95Jxaa	It's a good thing that he shows interest in potty training.  It's a good sign for you to continue his training.  It can also be helpful to you since you are nearly due for your next baby.  Just continue the good teaching for your kid.  It doesn't matter if he is only 21 months old.
NaJPIOheaa	hey there.. i'm reading a book called "taking charge of your fertility", great book, i'd recommend it, and i've learned(and experience) it will usually be lotiony/creamy or watery. though sometimes this is the CM that ladies get before they're AF is due to start, but the extra progesterone and estrogen will produce more CM, so you would see more than normal, and usually will be lotiony and watery throughout the pregnancy... good luck dear! xo

sPQBluKEaa	it could be pregnancy. it could really be anything. you crave odd things when you're pregnant, though.|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	No, not a sign.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I have never heard of that....especially not being the only sign.  I think maybe milk can be more of a symptom as opposed to a sign.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	It's a sign that you need more calcium in your diet.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Uh, I crave milk and I am no where near being pregnant.  U can crave something without being pregnancy related....|`|hZ9omSataa	$ store sells tests|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Cravings in itself are a sign of pregnancy, it doesn;t necessarily have to be milk you're craving to be pregnant. Keep in mind though, that some women do get cravings before their menstrual cycle too. I think you should take a pregnancy test to see if you're preggers, because craving were what made me take my test, and it was positive|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	It could just be a sign that you need more calcium.  Your body will crave things when it's lacking in them.  If you're having other pregnancy symptoms, then it could be because of that.  I craved milk while I was pregnant, but not until the second trimester I think.|`|a1XEf8lKaa	craving something doesn't mean that you are prego, it means that you are lacking some kind of nutrients in your body, and you body is reacting that way so you will give it what it needs, drink milk if you crave it and get a pregnancy test just to be sure!|`|ryh5AslRaa	sounds like it...when your pregnant you sometimes crave milk and dairy due to a lack of calcium you can also look on your finger nails or what not and if you have white patches on them its usually the sign of lack of calcium|`|LCHnUuS6aa	Probably not.  You may have a deficiency in your diet, for example, calcium and your body is letting you know by craving milk.|`|lqLzULXEaa	Just because you crave things does not mean you are prego maybe you need to stop eating all those ding dongs and twinkies|`|pus08YEOaa	it could be anything<br>  <br>  random cravings are not specific to pregnancy only|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	It's a sign of thirst.|`|46K4FtE0aa	It is a possibility, but not a sign of pregnancy. I craved burnt toast and extra strong coffee with my first. Take a test when you are 7 days late and use the first urine you pass when you wake up in the morning.|`|4GwTDea1aa	It coould be a sign or something else.. Depending on if you have had unprotected sex i would take a test just to be on the safe side!<br>  I creaved CHOCOLATE milk every morning and night my first few months.. Good Luck|`|9qmWUg6xaa	It could be a sign of pregnancy, but it could also be a sign of your body lacking particular nutrient(s), and you are getting that from milk.|`|wphI41wNaa	Probably no I hate it too and I will crave milk sometimes but its just my body saying I need some
rDw9N09iaa	yes, you can have a std while you are pregnant. but when you go to your first ob appointment they will test you for pretty much all of the std's. and in the early stages of your pregnancy your discharge should be a clear color and it starts to turn a yolky white color as the pregnancy continues. i hope this helps.|`|AA10186411	Yes, you can get an STD while pregnant.  If its any color other than clear or white (even white sometimes isn't good) then there is probably an infection.  Just see your doctor.|`|TGzOrftPaa	Yes, you can have an STD while pregnant.  If you indeed are pregnant and do have an STD you need to get treatment for it as soon as possible.  Usually an STD while pregnant presents itself with dark yellow to greenish discharge that has an odd and discernable odor.  Regular discharge while pregnant (in the beginning) can change to a deep white almost creamy tan color, but not yellow as associated with an STD.|`|OY8Z5vG9aa	yes you can be pregnant and have an std at the same time. your discharge shouldnt be anything but whiteish. any other colors, bright yellow, green, grey, could mean infection or std.  please see your doctor immediately to find out.<br>  <br>  also if there are any odors to it, itching, burning, these are other signs on an infection.  but remember some stds dont present themselves with straight up symptoms, even a change in discharge can mean something.|`|SFNXSLumaa	The discharge you have during pregnancy (that gradually gets heavier as you get further along) is white, it is called leukorrhea if you want to google it.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	You can have an STD while pregnant. Your discharge is supposed to be white or clear. Yellow and green mean infection of some kind. You might have more discharge when pregnant but it shouldn't change colors.|`|a1uoxczTaa	yea you can have an STD or an infection if there is a strong smell or if the discharge is yellow, greenish, or grayish.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	If you have a frothy, green, cottage cheese like, or smelly discharge, see your doctor
6YELMQd9aa	That's a great question because it's hard to trust anyone these days but just follow your heart.|`|G2auAv1Saa	I tell my daughter she is free to speak to anyone and be friendly but she never needs to tell anyone our address or phone number unless she is lost from me and then she needs to find someone who is a worker where we are. What I have taught her about strangers is to never go with anyone or let them touch her, talking is perfectly fine. <br>  You want them to not be so terrified to ask for help when they need it.|`|ATyHswTTaa	in this day and age u dont know who to trust.. i would never leave my son out my sight and reminds him of what happened to lil maddy.. he refuses to speak to strangers and i perfer it that way.. if im with him he do answer the waitress himself and also knows who my friends are, as do tell him who meeting in advance and show him a picture also of my friends.. but i remind him never speak to a stranger at all, even if they say they know me, but then he would know who my friends are from pictures.. in my area there was 3temps of kidnap in last few weeks, a guy been watching schools on the time to go him, any left waiting this man approaches, i rather my son to run screaming as this man stranger then say hello and be taking away from me.. its not like the times where i grow up, we cant leave the kids today out from morning to night as not safe anymore.. <br>  teach ur 3yr old who ur friends are, and if ur not around at a time then she not speak to strangers and run away screaming.. better be safe then sorry!|`|GNXf60R1aa	Well I told my son he could talk to someone as long as he was with me or my husband, or any other family member. I told him not to talk to anyone he doesn't know, unless he is with one of us. It might sound bad, but better safe than sorry. When he gets older , he just turned 3, then I'll explain about bad people in better detail. i think that is all he need to know for right now.
UDENYO4raa	No real meaning... I've had some crazzzzy dreams since I've been pregnant... One's of me thinking I was married to someone else, getting shot..... It's endless on the weirdness I've experienced in them. lol. Get used to it! :) Another joy of pregnancy.|`|u7LSohRyaa	It depends on the guy and his situation. It may be worth trying again or maybe it's just wishful thinking cause he's bad news. If that's true, you can use the dream to fit somebody like your boyfriend, only better. In any case, he will probably still be in your life if he wants to see his child.|`|vvB0Etysaa	Life is full of surprises.<br>  That means you are thinking of him and trying to be a family if it is possible.|`|AA11635397	that you're scared of doing it on your own and want him in the picture. Don't worry sweety, ya'll will get back together. I believe all you gotta do is talk to him about ya'll baby and tell him how much ya'll should try to make it work. Let me know if it works out ok sweety. Congrats on your baby.|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	It means that you wish it would happen and it's on your mind a lot, so it's being manifested in dreams.|`|8N4aPcpaaa	That u are dreamin about your babys daddy!
AA12193113	child support and try to be the best mother you can!  You can do it, besides if he hasn't helped he most likely isn't going too.|`|oojO4WAraa	Get a lawyer and get child support established.  Do it today.|`|g9TxgMlwaa	Go get child support and quit bugging the man.  If he really wanted to be involved he would have helped.

If he hasn't helped financially yet then he never will without being forced.|`|AA11109728	You have two options - go file for child support, or forget about him and manage things on your own.|`|N6rHtZ4qaa	It happens whenever you offer PEOPLE sex. before realizing that they dont love you|`|kYgog41Gaa	I think you should not believe in him anymore, he;s the dad okay nobody will take that from him, just keep living your lofe with your baby amd if you want let him see or visit, but I would not believe in that help anymore...|`|bEn6hiamaa	I know this can be very frustrating, especially with a new born at home.<br>  just speak to him & tell him you would appreciate it if he could help out every once in a while.<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|Qa86SBQnaa	dont even fool around girl take him for child support! he will be mad but he will get over it it is just as much his kid is it yours!|`|P4JLGguJaa	only one thing to say!!  CHILD SUPPORT!!
2N4j1ficaa	if they arte quit happy yes but screeming its head off no  bad|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	It depends on the baby.  My oldest actually preferred this.  He's 4 now and has been very independent since he was just a few months old.  My youngest is 12 months old and he is the opposite.  I would never force this on him.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	There are two ways to look at it. One idea is to give your baby lots of attention which is hard in the short term but teaches them that they can depend on you and are safe and secure in there environment teaching them to be independent in the long run. The other is that they should be taught to be independent from birth by not "spoiling" them with being held.<br>  <br>  I let my son play on his own as long as he was happy with it. He is a clingy child, 11 months old, but he is growing out of it on his own as most children do. I personally think it's personality, it's just who he is. I have friends that that have done both ways and I don't see a huge difference in clinginess. They all eventually grow up and I don't plan to push my baby to grow up any faster than he needs to.|`|z5EDtgtyaa	I believe it is a good thing. I don't know if there is a name for it because I'm not a dr. but I do believe that if the baby isn't crying isn't in need for a diaper change or anything like that, putting the baby down is perfectly fine. and if you think about it this way if you are always holding the baby how are you going to get anything done. waiting until the baby falls asleep can take longer than just putting him down when he is perfectly fine.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	NO! a baby is NOT independent nor should it be- this notion is crazy. a baby doesn't have an attention span that long- my son is nearly 2 and won't stay playing by himself that long. loving and hugging your child and paying attention helps them become more secure with themselves. its sad that a kid has to get use to their parent not being there. some babies are clingy and some are not- leaving a clingy baby for 30-45 minutes by themselves would only make it worse|`|AA10186411	Yes, its true.  If you constantly hold your baby, and are around they will have attachment issues.  Your baby could use a break from you, as well as you could use a break from him.   I would put a few toys in his crib, and let him play for a little while alone.  He may cry a little bit, but its fine.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	I don't think that's true at all, I mean my son was the clingiest baby around. Now he's 12 months and he loves walking all over the place exploring on his own. He only comes up to me when he wants a little cuddle or he's hungry or ready for bed.<br>  I think if you want your baby to become secure with themselves, then make the hose safe and let them explore. If they hurt themselves let them know you will always be there for them.
aIgI0FOXaa	if im honest with you my 2nd labour was longer and more painfull than my 1st one.<br>  My 1st labour i only had gas and air and wasnt pushing for all that long yet my 2nd labour lasted 2 hours longer than my 1st and was a whole lot more painfull.<br>  Also with my 2nd i was pushing for about 45 mins and had to have 2 lots of pethedine during the labour.<br>  <br>  I never experienced after pains with my 1st but boy did did i get them after my 2nd, i was in that much pain with them i was taking strong painkillers for a week after the birth.<br>  <br>  Im due my 3rd in 10wks time and im hoping this labour is more like my 1st one.Also they say after each birth the after pains get worse so i dread to think what they are going to be like this time.<br>  <br>  All in all though no matter how painfull birth can be its an amazing experience pushing your child into the world.|`|ROJans2Taa	second one I pushed for half the time, I got the epidural with my second so it seemed better,lol. I had really bad after pains though which I never had with my first, I thought I was hemorrhaging or something it felt horrible, but it only lasted 2 days off and on, best luck|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	All 3 of my births were different, my second was the fastest 59 mins to be exact, but that just means that the pain was very intense throughout that 59 mins!!  I didn't have any after pains after my first but did after my second, they were quite bad at times but like everything they probably vary from person to person.  My third birth was slower but I didn't suffer after pains, that said I had a collapsed womb so was drugged up to the eye balls!!<br>  <br>  Don't worry, I'm sure it'll be fine, enjoy being a mum of 2|`|TAGQ4FQQaa	my 2nd was definatly easier, i spent alot of time in the bath and breated really deeply thru my contractions, i didnt even need pain relief! my after pains hurt so make sure you have plenty of pain killers! im 3rd is due in 9wks so im gonna have her at home hopefully!|`|CIZjK2rAaa	My second was a dream compared to my first.  I dilated faster, she came quicker and the recovery was much better.  She even came 2 weeks before her due date.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|AA11538461	My afterpains with my second were worse than the labor.  It was like my body forgot that the baby was born.  The afterpains were 5 minutes apart and 90 seconds long.  My contractions with the second were not longer than 45 seconds.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	It may well be quicker this time, as you may be less stressed and less frightened, since you have been through it once. Also, your muscles have stretched once, so will stretch more easily this time. <br>  However, if this baby is a lot bigger than the first, it might be no better.<br>  My third birth was by far the easiest, as the first had been an induction and every time I got the better of the pain, they turned up the drip which made it worse again. That went on for hours. At least my second was not induced, but the pain was dreadful, and the nurses said that the woman who could scream loudest was the one who would get the epidural first. My screaming wasn't good enough, I had to wait and it hurt like blazes. The third was lovely  -  baby born at home, with a midwife AND a doctor to myself. I can recommend a birthing chair. That labour was short and much less painful as I spent it not in bed but on my knees with my head and arms across the bed.  So much less painful|`|IOp3knBjaa	So far I have been lucky and both of my labors were fast and really not as painful as I thought they would be. With my first I started with contractions, although with my second my water just broke and I really was not having any contractions. So, I was given pitocin to start contractions, but he still came very fast as well. As far as after pains I really don't remember having any with either of my children. I felt like I was on top of the world after I had both of them, couldn't wait to get out of bed and move around! Best of luck to ya though, hope things go smoothly!!|`|9QVjNaIPaa	not necessarily easy or harder...just different. with my first i was full term, i began having contractions (didnt hurt very much), went to hospital, water broke on its own, baby was born. simple. with my second i was dialating and not feeling contractions so when i went in for my 37 week appointment the doctor decided to admit me to the hospital, put me on pitocin (made contractions hurt like hell!), came and broke my water, sons head got stuck for a few mins, but all was fine. overall both were pretty easy for me but next time i definitely wont get pitocin!|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	My second labor was easier and faster.  I was in labor about 8 hours with the first, and 1 hour forty-five minutes with the second.  I never really noticed any after pains other than just being sore, not any after contractions.  I was less tired after the second because it was so much faster.  Good luck.|`|6ErVPePEaa	My son came a lot quicker than my daughter. With my first it was 5 1/2 hour labor and delivery. With my second (son) From the time I got to the hospital until he was born was only 2 1/2 hours. All the after pains were the same as the first. Just a quicker and larger second baby|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	No it wasn't easier at all lol. All my babies were face up though, so I think that is why labor was longer and more hours of pushing. I was in labor for 20 something hours with my first and second, and my third I was in labor for approx 12 hours|`|46K4FtE0aa	Yes my second labor was so fast the midwife who had just come on duty, didn't even have time to put on her plastic apron. The after pains were more of an uncomfortable ache than a pain and were eased with normal pain killers.|`|wphI41wNaa	I've only had one baby but family members have told me the second baby is a little harder to recover from and it takes a little longer to heal after too but its not to bad.|`|r9epzkJVaa	Labor pains will still be as painful as the first, usually. But the 2nd pregnancy and others to follow are usually shorter labors. Congrats on the new baby coming. After birth pains are really like labor pains which is helping your body get rid of the placenta naturally. I love the name Maddison, how adorable.|`|sWWX615gaa	my second labour was really quick bearly made it to the hospital. i was only fifteen mins in the labour suite. i did not get any after pains but people also say that the more kids you have the easier it gets so dont worry you"ll be fine good luck!!!|`|xaWEdRNWaa	My 2nd baby came out really fast and it didn't hurt as much as the 1st!  But, when I breastfeed and my uterus was contracting down, that really hurt more then the 1st.  All in all, nothing to worry!  I think you might just be anxious because this time around you know what to expect!  Take care!|`|muOdsIv1aa	Second labors generally are much easier than the first. I have had 4 children and it is true that with each labor the after pains increase. My fourth son was a home birth, and I sailed through my after pains like he was my second :) Though I did not do this with my first three and I was fairly miserable, after my third.  <br>  After each pregnancy your uterus has to contract to return to its normal size, however, there are some things you can do to help ease this process and the pain.<br>   Raspberry leaf tea is a tonifying herb. Which means it will help to tone your uterus. It is also used to help with nausea, ease labor and delivery, and post- partum recovery. It is also helpful for regulating menstrual period  It is extremely safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. I drank 2 cups a day thought out my entire pregnancy and after ( I still drink it for that time of the month :) <br>  Second is Cramp bark tincture, which is an antispasmodic herb. I found that this was the best pain relief I have found for after birth pains. You take this when you really need it generally in the first few hours. My after birth pains only lasted the first 48 hrs. I used Cramp bark, 1/2 dropper every hr as needed. I think I only took 4 droppers total in 2 days. As this is a muscle relaxing herb you don't want to over do it or take it for a long period of time. I still use it for my period cramps and 1-2 doses seems to work wonders. Also, continue to drink 2-3 cups of Raspberry Leaf tea. I alternated Cramp bark between my Rasberry leaf tea. It seemed to offer the best relief, longer.<br>  I know it can seem kinda scary when you think "I just gave birth! Why do i have to have more pain after the labor is over?!", but the truth is its really not that bad (even after 4). It can catch you a little off guard at first when you start to breastfeed (the contractions will pick up a bit), but you are so wrapped up in your new baby it kinda fades into that ecstatic fog :)
vue9NOhYaa	Most women become fertile again within  a few weeks of going off the pill.  A small percentage of women require several months or more. This is true regardless of the type of piill and how long you've been on it. <br>  <br>  Once you are ovulating again, you have about a 25-30% chance of conceiving every cycle of 'actively trying.'

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Pros of a c-section: if there's something wrong, the baby can be taken very quickly. However, in the case of an emergency, they may have to knock you completely out, and then give you an up and down incision instead of the bikini cut, which is not the friendliest of incisions. <br>  <br>  Other pros: for some women, they want to avoid the anticipation of labor and delivery and think they're saving themselves pain. While some women have good recoveries, not everyone does and it's not pain-free. Plus it's lasting pain for several days and possibly weeks, whereas with a normal vaginal birth the contractions end and that's it. <br>  <br>  I'm sure there are other pros to having one, but I can't really think of too many. I guess it depends on who you ask. <br>  <br>  Risks: you can have excessive bleeding, possible infection, scar adhesions (where the scar tissue literally sticks to itself or other organs, which can cause infertility issues) and it can potentially lower your chances of having a vaginal birth later, depending on your doctor. You can also have a uterine rupture in a subsequent pregnancy without even having a VBAC, even though the risk is very low - about the same rate as having a rupture during a VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean). Also, if you plan on having more kids, you  will build up more scar tissue with each c-section, and your uterus could become compromised in future pregnancies. <br>  <br>  You have greater restrictions on movement - no stairs, no driving, no heavy lifting anything other than your baby. Bending and moving around are usually more difficult, and you generally have to take pain medications for several days, which can be constipating and sometimes habit forming for some people. Some people find it difficult to nurse afterwards because of pressure of the baby on the incision. And in some cases, the spinal can drug the baby, which makes it harder to get it to latch on when it's groggy (this happened to me in the hospital with my first). Also, babies born via c-section can sometimes experience respiratory problems because they haven't come through the birth canal, which acts to 'squeeze' everything out and stimulate breathing, etc. <br>  <br>  In some cases, it can cause injury to the baby by knicking it with the scalpel. And some women, in rare cases, have actually died as a result of having one. <br>  <br>  Pros of vaginal birth: much faster recovery time. You can walk, move around, roll over in bed and drive a lot sooner and with less effort than with a c-section (at least in my experience). You have fewer limitations on activities and it's especially easier to take care of other children, if you have them. You can also lift and hold your baby much easier in the hospital than if you have stitches.<br>  <br>  You also get to go home from the hospital 2 days sooner. I always had a lot of trouble sleeping in the hospital so to me, that was a big deal. <br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry, I think I wrote a book here. :)|`|vue9NOhYaa	Pros of c-section -- if a vaginal birth would be dangerous for baby, it can save baby's life. (Or mom's.)  Otherwise, if there is a choice, a vaginal birth is ALWAYS safer and better.<br>  <br>  Your body is made to be able to give birth. A c-section is major surgery, and requires a long recovery.|`|YlLmAADraa	with a c section it takes longer to heal and you are in the hospital longer, you cannot hold your baby on your stomach cause you are super sore, it leaves a scar (not to bad cause its at your hair line) takes longer to lose the belly, can't lift anything heavier than your baby for 6 weeks.<br>  <br>  I had a c-section and i honestly would have rather had natural but there were unseen complications. natural is the way to go.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	NATURAL BIRTH= 1. easier and less traumatic birth for both mother and baby. 2. recovery time is less. 3. less complications. 4. you will feel a sense of achievement whereas if you have a c section you may feel let down. 5. its a great experience! 6. yes its more painful but you forget about it as soon as baby arrives plus you go numb.<br>  C SECTION= 1. Your more likely to be in a pain free situation at the birth but in agony for 6 weeks or more after and may not even be able to pick your baby up! 2. evidence suggests its more traumatic on both mother and baby. 3. your scar may get infected and tear. 5. you can have terrible back pain from the epidural for years after i know because my sis in law had one. 6. epidurals increase your chances of c section. 7. you may feel it was so traumatic you dont want anymore kids. I am not saying every woman feels a c section is terrible but most i know wish they could have had a natural delivery. good luck!|`|52U22fiAaa	Csection is major surgery.  It may take a while for your milk to come in, and you won't be able to hold your baby immediately.  <br>  <br>  Natural birth is what our bodies are equipped for and recovery is a lot faster.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	I have heard that the difference with pain is vaginal=pain during....csection=pain after.|`|aIgI0FOXaa	ive never had a c-section but my cousin and a very close friend of mine both have.<br>  my cousin had a c-section 5 years ago as the baby was positioned wrong, she ended up staying in hospital for 5 days and she said she had a lot of pain. Also her scar kept bursting open and getting infected it took 6 months to heal properly after that.<br>  She has said when she has the next one she will have it naturally providing the baby is positioned right this time as she never wants to experience the hell of the c-section again.<br>  <br>  My friend had a c-section 18months ago and is now due in april with her 2nd baby she has opted for a vaginal birth this time as she doesnt want the long hospital stay or be limited to what she can and can not do.
bmoCpcdraa	both first names sound like boy names,,,,,|`|Elxuvon8aa	like the meanings ut hate the girls name I rlly dislike  Bella ella names Thewy make me think of elephants|`|fPuZGkmsaa	Your girl name I am not sure how I feel about the name Jadee... Hmmm. The more I read it and say it the more it grows on me. When I was picking out baby names I looked for names that where unique which Jadee is, names that were easy to pronounce and spell, and names that could not be made into nasty nicknames. Your girl names fits the bill for all three. And your boy name although it is a common name it is good because it is a family name. I think that your names are great. Good Luck and congrats.|`|igvUbqkyaa	Stephen Wayne is very cute. Stephen is a nice classic name. Wayne isn't my favorite but it does flow very well with Stephen! I don't care for Jadee but I love Isabella!! I would switch the girl's name around and go with Isabella Jadee or Isabella Jade.|`|P9RlLQH4aa	I very much like the girls name :) Not so much the boys name, but it all comes down to personal taste.|`|BCIfeHAqaa	I like the girl's.<br>  But not the boy's at all. ...it sounds so like western.<br>  Its ewhh, sorry.|`|LABYN2vOaa	I really like the name meanings behind the names, especially your daughter's name meaning. I think you, and your husband, did a great job at naming your little ones. :)
WPI0Z47saa	You should contact his doctor and they will give you the number of the early intervention program for where you live. I did this for my son (other issues) and it helps a great deal. They come to your house to evaluate him to see what milestones he isn't doing and they will fix it for you.|`|hvwp2bcVaa	I don't mean to be offensive, but is he overweight? that may be a big issue with his not hitting those mile stones...if not, this is serious and he needs to see his doctor right away|`|XRLbqtUbaa	It is possible he will skip crawling and just start walking.  have u talked to your peds doc about his development?<br>  <br>  Mine didn't walk until about 16 months...even though he was crawling, pulling up, cruising and everything else...|`|rjVALevtaa	Some babies don't crawl at all. That can be considered normal. As far as the walking goes, the average range for walking is pretty wide. Anywhere from 9 to 18 months is normal. <br>  <br>  If he isn't walking by 18 months, then talk to your doctor. Until then just try and be patient. Every baby is different, he will learn to walk, just give him time.|`|AA11981363	My little one walked a week short of 15 months and one very good friend of mine has a child who is almost 19 months old and just started walking (she needed some physical therapy to help her muscle tone). Have you taken him to a pediatric orthopedist? my child had hip dysplasia and that was why it was so hard to work for her.|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	Hi,<br>  I am sure everything is fine..My son didn't walk until he was 14 months but he crawled everywhere. I was just mention it to his Dr. They will all tell you not to compare your child with another... I would keep doing the walker and just use encouragement. <br>  Good luck.|`|rypsRNs0aa	I wouldn't be too worried about it. My grandson was very lazy too and just didn't want to know yet his sister tried to teach him. He normally copied everything she did if he could, but when it cam to taking a few steps, he just plonked down onto the floor.  Then suddenly one day he wanted to grab a toy car, but couldn't unless he stood up walked along the sofa and walked 2 steps. And that was that, from then on it took a few days and he walked several steps.  If you are worried tell your Doctor or the Health Clinic if you attend something like that. Boys do tend to take a bit longer than girls, they are just lazy like some grown  men.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	is he an only child or does he have siblings?<br>  <br>  the reason i asked if he had siblings is because younger siblings sometimes do that because they have other people to get things for them. try encouraging him to get things for himself, he will probably get frusterated at first. Good luck.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	I don't think it's serious but always consult your doctor.<br>  <br>  Many babies skip crawling & go directly to walking which is completely normal. I wouldn't worry about it at all. Some babies don't walk until much later & your baby's walking already! Congrats!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i would check with your doctor to see if possibly he has some developemental problems that could be supported with some extra help to correct the problem,  but dont panic, my cousin didnt walk until he was 18 months old and he just graduated from Princeton!|`|OF7ZHq19aa	Wow that's weird you should make an apointment so he can get checked out. Both my kids started walking at 8 an 8 1/2 months|`|AA10447677	You should talk to his doc about this.|`|EsGrIscFaa	Try a set up where there is something he loves and will want, such as a biscuit, just out of reach. Make it so he has to stand up in order to get it. Maybe put it on the sofa, show him it's there, then sit him down. If he moans, don't give it to him. Make him think the only way he can get it is to get up and do it himself.  If this seems like too much try lying him on his stomach and putting the biscuit a bit in front of him so he can't just reach it and will have to crawl (or improvise) to it.<br>  <br>  If he really makes no effort to get it, even though you know he wants it, I would consider seeing you doctor as there may be an underlying problem.|`|eNkVSd9aaa	My son is 14 months and finally just started walking so I understand how you feel. However, He should be at least crawling at this point-mine has since 6 months-I have heard of babies that skip crawling altogether and just walk too though.<br>  It's good that he holds your hands and walks-Mine had been doing that and he just took off walking the other night. I would say he is probably just going to do it when he wants to. I am a worrier though so I would probably run it by the pediatrician to see what they think. Also if he's heavier (like mine who is 26 pounds) rather than petite he has more weight to carry and that can hinder walking a little. My guess is he'll be doing it in no time but there is no harm in mentioning it to the doctor. Good Luck!|`|AA11134717	my baby girl crawled at 10 months and just started walking at 14 months. I think hes fine just bring it up to the doctor.
2SmDAnFAaa	First all custody cases are case by case and second if you are being a good and responsible parent there is no reason for the courts to take her away. Finish school... please and become someone your daughter can admire becuase of how you over came being a teenage mom!|`|ad71d0eeaa0431296ab39a9aed62cd73aa	My question is why would your mother even have a chance to raise your child? Typically grandparents do not get custody of their grandchildren no matter the age of the mother.<br>  <br>  Be a responsible parent and you should not have a problem.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well if your a good mom, no drugs abuse etc a court will not take the child a away from you...
GJu1LKfyaa	I think all chidren  don't want their parent to change.  They want things to stay the same where they are comfortable secure. Change to them means diffence and that sometimes doesn't set well with some kids.  The fact that he is Seven years old and even knows what a mid life crisis is means he's smart , I wouldn't worry about it just be his mom and he'll always fell safe.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	youre not close to midlife yet|`|UA8zGGTsaa	Try to explain to him what a mid-life crisis REALLY is, and that you are nowhere near mid-life. :)<br>  He probably just thinks its wierd that you have waited until now to get them done.|`|AA11109728	That's funny!  My mom actually got her 2nd and 3rd holes in her ears when she was older than that!  It's weird only because people usually get them done do much earlier on, but it's certainly not indicative of a midlife crisis!  Heck, you don't even qualify - you're not middle aged!  LOL|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	he must have just learned those words because at 7 he doesn't even know what a midlife crisis is|`|BRT2teSqaa	Why does he think that?  He's SEVEN!  He probably heard on tv and such, associating piercings with a "mid life crisis"  They make fun of the idea a lot on tv and movies.  No big deal.|`|RnB6D6ZYaa	Whoa, you're really old.|`|z0ro3VkJaa	He doesn't understand the concept of a midlife crisis.<br>  <br>  He does however understand that it bugs you and is thus hilarious.|`|0Ww9gRkSaa	first of all, how does your seven year old son know what a midlife crisis is?<br>  <br>  second of all, he is seven... dont get all caught up in what he thinks, even if he is your son. you are smarter than him.|`|QmctfVJtaa	your son is full of shat. he is SEVEN! he isnt frill.|`|smsUZG4Iaa	he's 7 does it really matter.
BwXJXeezaa	I did have this too - its phlem back there and it did go away... I although delt with this at 5 months old.  Keep sucking that snot out it will help - and if he were older i would say use some juice/water mix to break that phlem up but because you cant do that I would keep at it... if it doesnt go away in another week call again - its good its not in his lungs but he might have an allergy or something|`|MR9iBgafaa	My baby contracted a cold at 2 months and 4 months. She's 5 months old now.<br>  <br>  The first cold led to a chest infection, but as long as your doctor checked with a stethoscope then it'll be fine.  Mine needed antibiotics for the chest infection.<br>  <br>  The second cold was just a cold but sounded nearly as bad! It's awful as they sound so poorly - I kept thinking it was serious.  But as the doctor said - it went away.<br>  <br>  Calpol (2 months +) or other child paracetemol will help the baby with the aches and help him sleep.<br>  <br>  Worth going back to doctor's in a few days if it doesn't get better just to check on the chest.<br>  <br>  Other than that it'll be fine.
CdJtH0xdaa	25 or older|`|CRvdmFwCaa	My Husband was 31 when we started dating and I was 18.  I don't think should be an age cap on love... as long as it is for the right reasons.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	When the person is old enough to be your parent. That's just my opinion.|`|gP0gYbBaaa	well to me, age is only a number.|`|QQE58qFQaa	Age is just a number in my book : ), <br>  if your 18, your legal, than anything above 18 is fine|`|AA11296427	If you love someone for real, age is only a number.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|EeGlkABPaa	anyone over 10yrs older is too gross|`|mPCSbit3aa	Age is just a number. If we as a country weren't so obsessed by judging people by their age then we would be more open in our love life to many people. <br>  <br>  Who cares about age. It's the person and the soul inside that count.|`|HI9jZSObaa	im gonna say over 15 years older.|`|T9fek24eaa	No younger than 16, but not older than 22.|`|Jo8nlGVsaa	I would go with no more then 5 years|`|WL1cX9rTaa	well depends on how much money they have haha.. a 35 year old with no money bad!! and 80 year old millionaire GOOD!!
oiJITSNZaa	They add a different aspect to your life. They are the sweetest most innocent little people and yet can be the most frustrating because they can't tell you what's wrong and why they are crying. They are life's most rewarding things given.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Such as?|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Too vague.|`|VCCKfT3taa	Issues? Mostly debating with my husband over EVERY little detail of her life! Where will she go to school, will it be private or public? What clothes will she wear? When will we allow her to date?<br>  Not to mention current stuff like how long should she sleep, how much should she eat, does she need to go to the doctors?|`|AA11134717	they grow too fast!!<br>  no parent has issues with there baby's.|`|heDtLdz5aa	be a little more specific and you will get the answer you are looking for...sorry|`|Vl7trXXraa	such a broad topic. specifics??
EYqTV2EYaa	If you can't connect with any girl in high school personality wise, it's better wait until college because people are more mature, and commonly, many of the women are the same problems as you. As for the girl you found, you talk to her and find out if she's taken or not. If not, get to know her more and connect with her. If she is, it's highly recommended you wait until college.|`|Jn4Fpm1Laa	I'm always the first to flirt!|`|doHNEvf8aa	Advice #1: DO NOT use terms like "lone-wolf"<br>  <br>  okay and about the girl....<br>  try going up and talking to her, girls love attention so any kind of attention you give her she will love!  try and find some kind of common interest and talk to her about that. just be confident and don't freak out if she turns you down, your new to this, it takes time.<br>  <br>  hope this helps =]|`|gxiKIQIiaa	get a wingman that simply means a friend to ask for you!<br>  And your really cool everyone at my school picks girls by there looks!|`|A8xpb8waaa	If you aren't interested in this person as your wife I say don't waste your time in dating.  <br>  <br>  In my opinion you are already above average for not following the "crowd" and dating girls just to be dating, or worse using them for sex because you can.  There are lot of misguided youth out there who think they have to be in a relationship to mean anything.  <br>  <br>  You stated "I have 0 interest in REAL dating a girl, I just want to have a school relationship..."  if you don't have the interest, just know her as a friend.  Don't kill it with attempting to flirt and make it into something its not.  Girls are very intuitive, if she is a realistic kind of girl, ie. not trying to put some kind of spin on everything you do, but accepting of you for who you are, then she is gonna pick up real quick that you are not being sincere.  <br>  <br>  Take it easy, dont push for something that isnt there.|`|sJvpLSunaa	first of all it doesn't have to the guy that flirts first and you say you've never flirted before so it's possible that someone has flirted with you but you just didn't notice (flirting's weird like that :P) anyways you should find out who she hangs out with and maybe ask some questions to see if she already has a bf and you know her interests and stuff. If all you want is a "school relationship" that's something you'd have to figure with he girl you like.
OPTDFRuzaa	wait a few days and test again if its neg see your gp as it may be too early for the  tests to pick up the pregnancy hormone.|`|BO28Mn8haa	Do you want a child? Because pre-*** can lead to pregnancy. And so can "not pulling out". You never know when you can be ovulating.  Wait a week or two and go back to the doctor.|`|WsUSAgLmaa	Sounds like you may have an STD (seriously) go get checked out just to be safe!!!
46K4FtE0aa	Take a test using the first urine you pass when you wake up, if that is negative and you still don't have your period, ask the doctor to take a pregnancy blood test to check.|`|LDPabWk0aa	Have you try taking a pregnancy test.|`|PMrTleDJaa	course .  it depends on if you have been having a lot of s3x without condoms!!!|`|BO28Mn8haa	did you take a test??
oA8Rtyxuaa	Yes I think its crazy too. I know some women just want kids, but if you have six at home, you are probably good for a while! Especially if you don't have a job. <br>  <br>  But the reason she is "famous" is because we made her famous. We always have to know what going on with everyone, blah blah blah...its out fault shes all you hear about!|`|lTsPX04jaa	i think people should just leave her alone. but at the same time i think its stupid that all of us are going to have to pay taxes to help pay for her children. its kind of a torn situation|`|vp1K0bxwaa	I think she's crazy. She needs to be locked up and her kids need to be adopted to families that can AFFORD them.|`|gC7OMToraa	I'm tired of hearing about her, she's insane.|`|YPycXcoLaa	ok yes she has made mistakes hasnt everyone? noone has seen any sort of abuse to these kids she is at least trying to get an education ahe clearly loves her kids and no i do not believe that she is out to get attention like the first answer everyone else made her famous i am quite shocked of all the things people has been saying about her there are other people with more then 14 kids such as the duggars but i have not ever heard anyone saying anything bad about them,yes she may very well have some sort of mental health problem but shouldnt we try and help her instead of just saying she is insane and her kids should be taken away i think a lot of people are judging her so harshly because everyone has dreams and hers was just different i am just wondering why no one has said anything about the IVF doctor surely if people think she is in the wrong then he is too?|`|EaDkj1JJaa	I think she is INSANE. It's clearly her trying to get attention and free stuff. I mean to have 8 babies on top of already having six...she needs help! And not to mention how many people has she sued in the last 10 years. This is a woman who wants kids but doesn't want to work to support them...she wants the government to support her and I personally think she needs to be mentally evaulated!|`|BGKjKfINaa	she is living in a fantasy land... <br>  <br>  how can she support them? by getting tax payers dollars for *18* YEARS!!!!!!<br>  <br>  This woman should NOT have these kids! I hope you understand other countries laugh at this kind of crap... only in America<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT- <br>  My main worries about this woman stem from that she sought out more babies while she already had 6.... that... she... couldnt... afford........<br>  Out of all her internet nicknames I think my fav has to be:<br>  "CLOWN CAR"|`|X7DKFr04aa	I think she did this so that she could get publicity and money.  She thought people would feel sorry for her and they would donate their time and money to her.  I feel so bad for these kids and wish them the best in their life.  Honestly she does not seem like a very good mother.|`|d397dMRZaa	She seems a bit doo-lally. If you've already got 6, why would you want to go in for anymore anyway? She won't be able to support 14 kids. I don't get why we have to know everything she does, I don't care really.|`|xc8bnpCvaa	I cannot answer that question with out using obscene language! What a pitiful life for those children! and what a burden on the states welfare system!|`|uZiNEtnIaa	selfish..|`|dPULl5hjaa	Nadya Suleman is a NUT CASE.  All her children need to be put up for adoption!<br>  <br>  All of the world is sick and tired of hearing about the OCTO-MOM!|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	If you can't feed don't breed. Haha
Ccq8zEcnaa	Sudden changes in vision could be a serious problem, I would call your doctor and let him/her know what is going on... I am sure they will want to check you out, or at least they can tell you what's going on.|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	see your doctor immediately. you could be suffering from high blood pressure, which is bad for you and the baby. it could be a sign that something is wrong, so you need to find out fast. call the doc and tell them you need to come in right away. if they are not available for you, go the emergency room. it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to pregnancy!|`|fQbTYvPmaa	You should have your blood pressure taken. Are you having any headaches or any other symptoms.
H0fXySX9aa	so what is your question?<br>  are you asking whether you should have the baby <br>  have an abortion or what?<br>  just because your man might be doing jail time he will be out and its not hard being a single mom i did it and i survived|`|v3LnJycKaa	well if it is a parole violation then he will end up doing the remainder of his time, not more than his time? How much time does he have left, and using the parole officer is mean is not an excuse if he was on parole for a mistake made in the past then he should have been on the straight and narrow, speak with his court appointed lawyer get all the facts 9 times out of 10 the offender wont tell the whole truth, havent you ever heard no one in jail is guilty.... thats what they will all tell you, they are there because of a bad police officer, and mean judge or a DA out for blood. There is a chance he will do a smaller bid 30-90 days, but you need to get involved and speak with the lawyers, him, and his parole officer.|`|FKf67HXaaa	I would try to talk to your husband and see how he feels about it, if you can. Its not fair for the baby but if you know he will be out sometime and you guys are going to stay together i would keep it, but thats just me. Try to talk to him or maybe your/his family to see if they could help until he gets out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck with everything and his sentencing!!|`|AA10693194	have your baby sweety.things will work out. A good friend of mine is in the same situation as you right now. her Hubby just got sent away for 6 years and she is 3 months pregnant.She didnt want the baby to grow up without a Daddy either. <br>   your baby will know about his/her father ,can talk to him on the phone and have visitations.you will do fine.people have hubbys who work away and their babies do just fine!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	have the baby, dont make a permanant decision based on a temporary situation, you will always regret not having the baby if you dont, but tell you husband to try to obey the law so his baby can have a proper father.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	You can always put the baby up for adoption. Have you talked this over with your husband?? Many single mothers make it nowadays, there is plenty of support from the government.|`|223CFrrZaa	You have to keep the baby! Like you said you want a piece of your husband with you even if he cant be there himself for a few years. Its not the baby's fault he commited a crime so dont punish it for his mistake and raise it to not make the same mistakes!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|LXNpu15paa	you should wait until his court sentence and then if he gets a long time start looking for someone new because if  hes gonna be there for a long time then you dont want to be miserable with no one there for your child|`|0NSax0u9aa	I know my tax dollars & everyone else's will support you.|`|75OCfSCzaa	This happened to me. I wasn't married but I was with him for a few years before conceiving a baby with him. He was arrested 3 days after conception and I found out when I was 9 weeks or so. Your going to go through every human emotion possible, over and over again, but your going to be fine. Mine got 6 years and me and the baby are doing just fine on our own. I went through the whole pregnancy and will be doing the first four years on my own. We still keep in contact and my little one gets to talk to daddy on the phone every week. Children just need love and attention. Your husband will always be daddy no matter where he is. Try not to stress too much over the legal stuff. The court system takes FOREVER. They usually end up screwing something up along the way anyway. I'm sure he'll get out a lot sooner then expected. Good luck :)|`|muOdsIv1aa	As hard as it seems to face the reality that your husband may have to do some hard time, hopefully the judge will look at this case with discretion and maybe he will get a milder sentence. I know several people who have been in similar situations and it doesn't always turn out as the worst case. But you and your baby are the innocents hurt by all of this. As scary as it may seem to be a single mother the reward will well worth it. I got pregnant as a teenager and had a rough go of it. But I finished high school and eventually married my daughters father. I now have a beautiful 12 year old and I can't ever imagine my life without her. I know with certainty that as tough as it was the lifelong regret would have been worse. I have lost two babies to miscarriage and the pain and loss was unbearable. There are so many support groups and networks out there that can help you through this, financially and emotionally. I joined a crisis pregnancy support group and later went on to mentor and help other woman who where in similar situations. I have also spent a lot of time with women, including my own mother, dealing with the pain and grief of post abortion syndrome. It all seems scary and uncertain but there are so many people out there who love you and will help you through this. You don't have to go it alone, just reach out.|`|r0KNCfdRaa	Congratulations on your pregnancy, and PLEASE keep your baby... <br>  <br>  Even if he can't be there right now, or even for a while down the road either, the fact that he WANTS to be there and WANTS the baby already has you at an advantage over a lot of other single moms. <br>  <br>  Having a baby and looking at a little person who is a part of you and a part of the person you love is the most amazing blessing in this life. They are the biggest cheerleaders in our lives without even knowing it, inspiring us to move forward, even when we're convinced that it's impossible... and even when we find ourselves alone. <br>  <br>  There are children raised by one parent who grow up to be just as emotionally healthy and wonderful as those that come from a two parent home, and on top of that even though your husband might not physically be there for a while, your baby will still grow in the light of the love you two share, because you will still be in a position to make a positive impression of your husband and your relationship on your child, whereas most single mothers don't have one good thing to say about their childrens biological fathers... I know I don't!<br>  <br>  I know this is lengthy, but I saw you getting some negative feedback and it made me sad... Some people hear the word "parole" and jump to the wrong conclusions about the person in love with the parolee.<br>  <br>  As far as things happening when they happen, try looking at it more positively... Because when you do have this baby, and it's daddy does come home, I think your husband will probably think twice before doing ANYTHING that his agent might not agree with. In the mean time, stay healthy and look into support groups in your area for women in your same situation... My prayers are with you and your growing family! :)

Not only that, what kind of parent are you letting your 15 year old have sex with someone whose 23? If it makes you angry why do you permit him to see her. She obviously has some kind of issue if she wants to date someone whose significantly younger then her. I would let that woman know that if it is his child, then she's going to jail because its illegal for her to have sex with him! And if I was a cop I would throw you in jail for being a terrible parent.
EaDkj1JJaa	It sounds like a little cold. If you have one of those humidifiers, those seem to help. Make sure you keep an eye on her and constantly check for a fever. If she seems to get more congested or it start to bother her (or if she develops a fever) I would call her doctor. Better to be safe than sorry!|`|r52rfBkeaa	If there's no fever, she may just be congested from allergies or caught a bit of a cold... my guess though would be that she's teething.

Xs0fhFJnaa	I'm so sorry for your loss. It's highly unlikely that either stress or rough sex caused your miscarriage - those are old wives tales.<br>  <br>  The vast majority of first trimestre miscarriages occur because of a fatal chromosomal abnormality, simple as that. Sometimes it takes the body a few weeks to catch up with the error. There is nothing anyone can do about it.<br>  <br>  I started trying two months after I lost my first at 8 weeks. A friend of mine tried again the following month after her mc and now has a healthy son.<br>  <br>  Try not to dwell on this - there is nothing you could have done to prevent it. Good luck.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	usually that early it doesn't really have much to do with the mother- i had rough sex when i was pregnant quite often. Don't feel like it was your fault. baby just wasn't ready to come into the world<br>  <br>   both my step-mom and my sister got pregnant again a month or two later|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Unfortunately most miscarriages will never be explained. Sometimes there is no reason. It's nothing you did. Rough sex would not necessarily cause a miscarriage either. A lot of women have rougher sex before (and even after) they find out they are pregnant and are ok. I'm sorry that this happened to you but there probably will never be an answer.<br>  <br>  Ask your doctor about when you can start trying again. He knows that answer because he knows your medical history and how you are healing. Ask him.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	no rough sex cant cause miscarraige i have had 2 so i know how you feel and you just want some answers. The only thing i know is miscarraiges normally happen due to stress but most of the time its because the baby would have died anyway due to a severe abnormality or disease so dont beat yourself up i know its hard but you never did anything to cause it. In time you will try again and there is a light at the end, since my 2 i have had 2 healthy boys. good luck and i am so sorry X|`|AA11426077	I'm so sorry! One of the things I found out was that it's a lot more common than some might think. In fact, some women have had miscarriages, not knowing they are pregnant, in the first trimester (usually early on) and never knew it, mistaking it for bad period cramps. Sometimes these things just happen. It's no ones fault. Sometimes the embryo isnt developing right and at that early, its hard for the doctor to tell. I know its hard to hear, but these things happen, sometimes there isnt an scientific reasoning :[. Good luck in your future pregnancies!|`|hoX7hoINaa	Sometimes it just isn't meant to be. Your body couldn't hold this little one. Once you are pregnant you should only have gentle sex, but its not for certain that was the cause. Just think of it as something that wasn't meant to be at this time, and next time is going to be right. Stay positive.|`|UdtzY5ciaa	It's horrible, but there is likely no explanation.  I'm so sorry for your loss.|`|0FrYFxFiaa	hi, ive been through the same thing...i have 2 children but have also had 2 miscarriages! there's nothing you can do hun,if its going to happen then it will happen! i know exactly how your feeling and i know it hurts,my last miscarriage was in june and i also had a d&c and i have jus found out that i am 9 weeks pregnant!im very anxious!i would wait until you had had a couple of periods...just to give your body and mind time to recover from the trauma,hurt! hope this helps you!|`|be8f30fb24796d0d5029ee335c955683aa	Up to 15% of pregnancies end in miscarriage in the first trimester. Because it's so early, most of the time it's unknown why. I had one at 9 weeks also. I got pregnant with my son 1 month later, and had a normal full-term pregnancy. He's 21 now!|`|eemmWU0Haa	rite away that's what I did, Ive had 7 miscarriages in all, good luck|`|04kOtcGgaa	i lost my first baby at 8 weeks and 2 days. i had an ultrasound 2 days before it died and everything was fine. they never told me why i lost it. but it could have been from anything. the same goes for you it could be from the stress earlier in the pregnancy or from the baby not being as healthy as it seem at your appointment. it could have been because your body didn't respond well to the pregnancy. you can never know. i didn't get a D&C the baby passed on it's own. i got pregnant 5 months after i had the miscarriage. i'm a high risk pregnancy (my doctor says ;) but i've been doing great this whole pregnancy. minus the preterm labor worries but he's gonna live and be healthy so i don't worry as much any more. when we tried again five months after we lost it we both felt it was time to try again. i felt my body and mind was ready. we tried on ouanniversarynaversery and it happened. i think you should do the same thing. when you feal your body and mind are ready go for it.<br>  good luck|`|I4yhcw5faa	I had the same thing happen with me a few years ago. I had a regular doctor appointment and they were doing an ultrasound just to be sure how far along I was. Well the baby was moving and "fluttering" and I thought everything was ok. They did the ultrasound only to tell me there was no heartbeat, the baby was dead inside of me and I would have to have a D&C. I told them they had to be wrong, I can still feel it moving, I have been pregnant before and I know what it feels like when a baby moves, but they showed me the monitor and the lump laying at the bottom of my uterus. I never bled, I never was stressed, never had rough sex, nothing at all. My D&C was scheduled the day before my husbands birthday.. <br>     It happened in April and they told us it would be safe to start trying again around June, or when your cycles are regular again enough. its been almost 2 years now already. Good luck hun, hope it works out for you next time.|`|kTu7UtS1aa	I know what you are going through.  I was pregnant with my first and then I miscarried at 8 weeks (Dec 08) and I also had a D & C done.  It's tough.  It took longer than I expected to come to terms with it.  I did nothing wrong, and neither did you.  Things like this just happen.  It's your body's way of protecting itself from something that wasn't right.  Perhaps the embryo wasn't "chromosomally" normal.  <br>  <br>  A few doctors say that you could try to get pregnant right away since your body is very fertile at this point, but my doctor said to wait 2 months (or at least one).  Your body went through so much that it needs time to recuperate.  I'm happy to say that I am pregnant again, but I just found out.  I am very scared to celebrate because of what we went through in Dec.  We are taking it one day a time.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	when i had my first miscarriage i lost the baby at 13 weeks. my second miscarriage i the baby at 8 weeks. both times they told me to wait at least 6 weeks before trying again. both times i lost the baby due to a blighted ovum, which means the baby never developed, there was never a heart beat. i waited longer than 6 weeks after the D&C to try again because i wanted to give my body and mind time to heal. the doctor can give you a better idea on the pro's and con's of trying as soon as possible and waiting. <br>  i dont believe rough sex can cause a miscarriage, it's usually that the baby wasnt developing properly, or the placenta didnt implant correctly. there are never any real answers, and i think that's the hardest part. <br>  i'm now 10 1/2 weeks pregnant and the baby has a strong heart beat! unfortunately i have a sub chorionic hematoma, meaning the placenta is partially detached from my uterus causing a hemorrhage in my uterus. i'm on bed rest, but the baby is still doing well.<br>  i'm sorry for you loss, and if you're ready to try again and the doctor clears you... go for it! and good luck

smsUZG4Iaa	omg  nuff said|`|vwuMTm7Saa	Have lots of sex and have fun.  Stress lessens the likelihood.|`|iiUKFLY3aa	Well first your partner should be ready as well, but sex every day won't always work as some people think. Try sex 3 days a week, so the sperm have time to build up and that way if you don't know exactly when you ovulate there will be sperm waiting. Sperm can live 5- 7 days inside you. Do not use any lubricant as that can kill sperm, even saliva. Try foreplay so you can get wet the old fashion way. Try to find out when you ovulate have sex that night but also the day before and even a couple days before. Sex in the morning too, its a bit yucky at times but that's when his sperm count is the highest. Kinda like when our hCG level is highest.<br>  There is a lot of websites you can just search, " get pregnant fast" " best ways to get pregnant " etc anything. Don't make sex a chore, try and keep it fun and intimate. Missionary would be the best position and doggie style or on your side. Do not move right away either, lay there for at least 5 minutes so the sperm have a chance to get far enough. Some women even go upside down on their heads for 10 minutes or more. Be aware the average time for someone to get pregnant even in their twenties is 4 -6 months. You have a 20% chance every month. Start taking prenatal vitamins now, and quite any drugs, smoking, and drinking and anything else that could be harmful. Those things also make you less fertile. <br>  Good luck :)|`|tdNfQWaAaa	Now that the first answer is taken care of, the best way to concieve is to make sure to track your cycles. You have to know when you ovulate. When you get alot of discharge that is "egg white" or stretchy. Go for it. Try laying down afterwards for 10-20 minutes. Hope this helps!! Best of luck!! xxxx|`|ENZPQceIaa	make sure u know when u ovulate...about a week b4 that start having sex everyday and go untill one week after. when sex is over lay down with a pillow under ur butt for about 20 minutes to allow the sperm to stay in. thats what i did and i got pregnant that month! i just gave birth to him in jan:) good luck!|`|D5cOFZdwaa	um duh its a little thing called sex
6vzUTj9saa	You should take another test or get a appointment with your doctor and they'll do some test to determine weather you are or not.<br>  Good luck!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Heavy bleeding is not a sign of pregnancy. Ever.|`|wFe7L1XJaa	If you had your period no matter how early it came you probably arent pregnant|`|kuj20srVaa	well to me its sound like you are i have a book on that. <br>  and i see you have the symptoms take a test again if it comes out negative go to planned paretnhood.and let them test you tell them how you feel but also sometimes it could be nothing ive had the symptoms before and ive had unprotected sex for over a year you sometimes get like that wen you worry about weather your pregnant or not you start feeling that way. recently i have been feeling that way but i havent taken a test id rather not find out lol|`|eKls7ooUaa	you aren't pregnant-if you want to make sure-go to your dr and be sure-but if you had a period and the test said no-then you aren't|`|yPNvecc7aa	You're not pregnant if you have your period. Especially if it's heavy.<br>  Take a test if it'll ease your mind.|`|2JQdGtHuaa	If you're bleeding like that then you're not bleeding unless you had a miscarriage. The nausea could be from having a stomach bug or something like that and the tender breasts and back aches could have been a sign that your period was about to start.
Fy9S6hjIaa	Since this is in the grade schooler section I'm assuming you are trying to rid your child of a cursing habit.<br>  <br>  Try putting his weekly allowance in a jar.  Break it down into Quarters.  Every time he cusses make him take one of the quarters out of the "Allowance" jar and move it to the "Cursing" jar.  At the end of the week he gets what money is in the Allowance jar and you get to keep all the money in the cursing jar.  Before too long he will want the full 5 dollars (or whatever amount) and will quit using curse words.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	the patch...|`|yPNvecc7aa	The swear jar idea works really well; If you have enough change to put in. <br>  <br>  You just have to keep reminding people "Don't swear" every time they do. It's nagging, but it works. Eventually they start remembering, or at least apologize when they do it.|`|zoRAtjYWaa	swear jars are really good because he will want his money back. tell him that cussing isn't acceptable in your house and you don't want him to cuss anymore.|`|Afj1GGptaa	I have the same problem...<br>  I make mine put a quarter in the jar everytime he swears.
ybexjS2Paa	One of the early pregnancy symptoms is higher body temperature. Bloating also. I'd take another test in couple of days.|`|stRWElvPaa	I would say the test wouldn't be accurate as it was too soon, and yes, temperature goes up after ovulation and stays elevated beyond the normal maximum of 18 days. So, if you are normally 36.6 post ovulation, then I would say that there is a good chance you're pregnant. <br>    good luck!|`|2f6diQBiaa	One temperature doesn't mean anything about pregnancy. Temps fluctuate a lot during the post-ovulation phase and you may find it go back down tomorrow. If, however, it stays up then it may be a triphasic chart, which is a sign of pregnancy (although not a firm sign- many non-pregnant charts show a triphasic pattern). You only have 4 more days until you can test and get an accurate result.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!
ESAM0U7xaa	well i've had brown discharge for the past 2 days...in the morning only and breif. my period hasn't been late more than a day...on or off the pill and never had spotting for 2 days like this. i have tested and it was a BFN. i'm now 2 days late. <br>  on the 7th if you don't get AF i would recommend a test.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|zdlLVB1Kaa	My guess is that your period is about to show up.  :(|`|yPNvecc7aa	Your period coming on would be my first guess.
azrKKNfTaa	i think you should tell her that a women and a man make a baby together, then explan how the 2 of you ended up with her. if she has more questions she will probably ask. just be honest and open|`|aOCfLAJJaa	TROLL.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	you mean ..you dont know?|`|CRvdmFwCaa	What a question, huh?  Don't they teach that in school anymore?  Wait til she gets her period and you have to explain how to use a tampon.  (FYI... just tell her to look at the directions in the box).  I would just be honest with her.  I mean no use her being 9 years old and swearing it's the honest truth that babies come from storks, cause that's what her daddy's told her.  <br>  <br>  Tell Here that<br>  1.  When a woman is mature enough her body will start to release eggs into her uterus that can be fertilized by a man's sperm. <br>  2.  If the egg is fertilized it grows into a baby inside the womans uterus/ belly.<br>  <br>  Just stick with the truth- The basics..  Depending on how she was born... a sarrogate, adopted, etc... Good luck daddies!  :)|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	Well, I guess it depends on how much you want to share with her. If you think she can handle the truth at her age, then tell her, if not, don't lie about it, just leave out s few unnecessary details.|`|sxecXFgraa	You should tell her.  She's going to find out soon enough.  Would you prefer her to hear the truth from you and your partner or some type of partial truth from another kid on the playground?|`|BRT2teSqaa	Tell her the truth.  Shes 9, not 2.|`|yPNvecc7aa	Well the "when a mommy and a daddy love eachother" story is obviously out the window in this situation.<br>  I think you'll have no choice but to get a little technical. There isn't really another way around it. You can also explain exactly where she came from. (Adoption) She'll probably be wondering where the woman who she came from is at this point so be prepared.<br>  <br>  If you think she's too young, then just let her know you'll explain it to her in a couple of years. I don't know your daughter's character, however I like to think at 9 she is probably mature enough to know exactly what is going on.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	Sex ed should really begin early, starting with toddlers noticing their bodies naked.  Still, it's never too late to start, even if you have to start with "the talk."  We have many talks in my household.  My 9 yr old knows about birth control and condoms at this point.<br>  <br>  I'm sure she's heard from friends who have straight parents who get pregnant with little brothers & sisters that sex has something to do with it.<br>  <br>  You can still rent the old NOVA video on DVD from Blockbuster.com and probably Netflix, too.  That's a good place to start.  <br>  <br>  If she is biologically one of yours, let her know that this was done with her bio mom.  Answer questions from there about why you're not together anymore, to her age-appropriate understanding.<br>  <br>  If she was adopted, explain that her biological parents did this, and answer questions from there about adoption.<br>  <br>  If she was the result of in vitro or a surrogate, explain that not all babies are produced by physically having sex, but that the sperm and the egg can be put together under a microscope to make the baby, and then put inside a woman until the baby is ready to be born and live with her daddies. <br>  <br>  Keep it age appropriate, to the point, and let her know it is perfectly normal to ask questions she's supposed to ask you and she's doing nothing wrong by bringing it up.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SRsFkNBBaa	is she adopted? or from previous hetro relationship? <br>  you will probably want alot of time for this discussion, because she will have questions also about your present relationship, after you explain the basics. <br>  i would be honest, as far as telling her that it takes a mom & dad. up to you whether you explain the process. then tell her that god has a different plan for some people, for example, your family. you and your partner were lucky enough to find each other in a special way, so your family is a little different but no less important. and you guys got the joy of getting a little girl in the process. if you adopted her, tell her she is special becuase you "picked"her out of a lot of kids-if she isn't then she can still be special, becuase one of you and her mom made her, and she will be the only one!!|`|xQofZDdNaa	You need to be honest. <br>  And if you know the mother, or still talk to the mother, then you should tell her that, she has a right to know.<br>  If she was adopted, then tell her there was a man and woman etc. and they decided that they needed a good family to love you. And then explain adoption.<br>  Don't hide anyhting or lie to her, that will only make her confused, or angry later on.|`|RzYePezkaa	Just tell her there are many different ways how babies come to be the most common happens when a man and a woman fall in love and get married they decide to have a baby and they do,or in our case insert adoption/surrogate etc in.Good luck|`|z0ro3VkJaa	The truth as far as you know. It depends on how she actually was born.<br>  <br>  Was she adopted? She should know that.<br>  Did one of you use a surrogate mother? She should know that.<br>  <br>  It doesn't do her any good to sweep the truth under the rug.|`|AA10236694	i would tell her the truth about how she was made and then tell her how lucky she was to get two dads and then read her this book<br>  One Dad, Two Dads, Brown Dad, Blue Dads<br>  and another good book is <br>  The Family Book by Todd Parr|`|9EVcTnUWaa	I'm gay also and this is the way that I explained it to my girls.  Yes you need a man and a woman to have a child, You need the sperm from the man and the egg from the woman.  IF your child was conceived the conventional way and than adopted explain that she came into the world the same way that every other child did and that her biological parents couldn't take care of her and than explain that you and your partner adopted her.  IF she was conceived for you with one of your sperms and a friend carried her explain that. You have to explain how you got her and how she was conceived, You also have to expect her to want to contact her biological parents if she's been adopted, her biological mother is that's the way that it happened.  You have to understand that at some point that might be what she wants.  But right now you have to deal with the basic components which might be just biological and that simple.|`|Zk91ubupaa	Just tell her the truth..
DMsjoZwSaa	These definitely are signs of Autism, however, some children are just different than others, especially in the level of development and when. <br>  <br>  When you said that he screams at slight noises and does the arm flapping, that is almost enough for me to tell you to just have it checked out. As you probably know, already with a child that has Asperger's, Autism is, in a so many words, hypersensitivity. <br>  <br>  The earlier specialists can catch Autism, the easier it will be for the child and its peers to learn to cope or learn new ways to teach new things. <br>  <br>  If you are truly concerned, don't take no for an answer...my sister's daughter was turned away from the time she was 9 months old until she turned 4. Doctor after doctor claimed they didn't want to measure the development until she turned 5...I've read that Autism can be fully-diagnosed as early as 1 year (or less!)...It definitely caused a lot more stress than needed, as we weren't sure why she wasn't on par with her peers. <br>  <br>  There's a ton of articles online about regulating Autism and the fits with a different diet...my sister SWEARS by it. Also, look on Google for groups, if the doctors won't consider Autism, you can at least have insight in new ways to help your child develop happy and healthy|`|1SGl03Zlaa	If you are really concerned about it talk to a pediatrician right away.  It won't hurt to get it checked out.  The waiting list for autism screenings is about a year or more in most areas so by the time you get in he should be old enough to diagnose or if he stops showing signs before you get in you can just cancel the appointment.  Either way there's no harm in trying to get on the waiting list as soon as possible.|`|5437985b95888863b86a1b13cbbbd60eaa	he's 6months old... its gonna happen. Maybe he does have a tad of autism, but that's not always a bad thing. one of my closest friends is autistic and he's a friggen genius. Boy readin about a hundred books a month, no lie. I wouldn't worry about it too much right now, but if it continues past like a year and a half and you still cant calm him, then maybe he should be tested.|`|7ZMmQhWraa	Sounds like he is a brat.Not autistic. Try gripe water to calm him down he might be suffering from the colic.|`|4JuwXJrEaa	Our pediatrician said it's too early to diagnose Autism at that early age.  We were asking about my daughter because she was rocking back and forth all the time when she was 4 or 6 months old.  She's 11 months now and that has stopped.  Some of the things you mention are normal and my 11 month old does them too like holding her breath when she is told, "no" until she turns blue and then she screams.  She just has a temper and a strong personality.  My daughter hated most foods at 6 to 9 months too and is just starting to open up to table foods now that they have been offered to her many many times.|`|YP1DXbBDaa	It sounds like normal behavior for a six month old.  Remember that the tantrums and arm flapping behaviors are the only ways that your son has to communicate now-he doesn't have words or gestures like an older child or an adult.  And the baby food objection can be a sign that he's not ready for solid foods yet-the tongue thrust (pushing it out of the mouth) as well as gagging are ways that babies protect themselves from choking when they're not ready to eat solid food yet.  <br>  <br>  Screening for autism is recommended at 18-that's about the earliest that clear signs will show and where they can be definitively observed and not considered normal behavioral characteristics or developmental milestones-while some children show signs earlier, some of the traits are very similar to normal childhood behavior and it's important to wait until a clear diagnosis can be made.  If you're concerned, there's no harm in talking to your pediatrician but it's really much too soon to tell.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Yes it could be autism.  I have 3 sons, 2 on the autistic spectrum.  <br>  <br>  The younger one we called early intervention and got him into the neurologist at 9 months who promptly diagnosed him with PDD.NOS (atypical autism).  He is now 3.5 years old and clearly is on the spectrum.  <br>  <br>  60 percent of 12 month olds are dx accurately.  We did get a second opinion at kennedy krieger at 12 months ( I called at 6 months) they agreed an autistic spectrum disorder.  <br>  <br>  What had me concerned was I did an assessment questionnaire <a href="http://www.childbrain.com/pddassess.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.childbrain.com/pddassess.html</a><br>  <br>  His score came out to 49, 50-100 is mild PDD.  He now scores 82-87<br>  <br>  At 9 months my sons didn't babble much, he had poor eyecontact, did smile, did cuddle, didn't wave, or clap, repetitively did things over and over, played with things that werent toys.  Sitting on the floor he loved to play with the handles of the drawers of the dresser lifting them up and dropping them to hear the sound for hours.  He would get upset if he was disturbed.  He wasn't crawling.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	At this point, do not loose sleep about the behavior. On his one year check up, should the behavior continue, have a thorough discussion with the pediatrition and request a referral to a specialist. You may find out by then that it was just a phase.|`|oojO4WAraa	I think you should have him evaluated by a professional.  You might be overreacting because your first son has Asperger's but maybe not.   Early treatment is best.   Take him to the doctor.|`|AA10628838	Since you are already aware of the signs, you are a step ahead in spotting the symptoms. We have a son with Asperger's the same age as yours. He did develope an adversion to lots of foods and will not eat but about 7 different things. Even though he didn't display the temper tantrums as early as your son, he did turn his back to the wall and cry, but that changed drastically when he was 18 months old. I wish you the best. Document everything you notice out of the norm and video taping is also a big help, and find a doctor to that will listen to you. Perhaps your 9 year old's doctor will be more willing to listen to you since your oldest has been diagnosed with Aspergers. .|`|B5MDTdtPaa	no doctor will say a baby has autism until 12months old at the very! least as this is the earliest proper signs can be detected...most signs arnt until theyre 18months+ (Attwood notes that autism can be diagnosed in children as young as 18 months but in practice this even may be hard to achieve)<br>  <br>  ..you may be looking to much into his behavious seeing as your worrying due to your other child having aspergers syndrome your worrying to much this one has a disorder? definately chill until 12months at the very least and then start seeing if hes got the symptoms of autism:<br>  -No babbling by 12 months. <br>  -No gesturing (pointing, waving goodbye, etc.) by 12 months. <br>  -No single words by 16 months. <br>  -No two-word spontaneous phrases (other than instances of echolalia) by 24 months.|`|heDtLdz5aa	my nephew has asperger's syndrome also and his was diagnosed later than a year i think he was almost 3 by the time they  had it in pointed...it could be that you are looking too much into it..in fear of having another autistic child..i know when my sister had her second child she was worried about the same things...tell your concerns to the pediatrician and maybe he can make you feel better..
YP1DXbBDaa	I had microsupply due to polycystic ovaries and a thyroid disorder.  I couldn't have nursed without medication.  And while in the US, there's nothing approved for increasing milk production, the medications are approved in other countries for that purpose.  <br>  <br>  Thomas Hale (who is considered the top expert on lactation and medication)  recommends the use of Domperidone rather than Reglan-Reglan is more readily available because it's approved by the FDA to treat stomach issues, but Domperidone is safer-it has fewer side effects for the mother and it doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier, plus less of it goes into your milk.  <br>  <br>  Your OB can write a prescription for either medication-Reglan you can fill at your regular pharmacy, Domperidone will need to be filled at a compounding pharmacy-be sure that if your OB does write a prescription that it just says something like "Take as directed" rather than saying that you're taking it for breastmilk production or there's a risk that the pharmacy won't fill it or that your insurance won't cover it.  You can also order Domperidone online from Australia and New Zealand-it's sold legally as an over the counter medication there (just like we buy Tylenol over the counter here) and In House Pharmacy ships it to the US-this is my preferred source for it-my daughter's pediatrician wrote me a prescription that I had filled at a compounding pharmacy until I got my order from In House Pharmacy (and the pediatrician's office is the one who recommended buying it from there, so I trust them as a reliable source) and after that I bought it online.  <br>  <br>  Your daughter has had her palate evaluated and her tongue checked for a tongue tie too? Those are things that can also affect nursing. <br>  <br>  While it's rare even with medication, I didn't make enough milk for my daughter and we had to supplement-instead of buying formula, we got donated breastmilk though Milkshare.Org-mothers with extra breastmilk donate it to mothers who don't make enough or to babies with health issues or adopted babies whose mothers can't nurse them.  I'm so very grateful for the donor milk that we've gotten-it feels much better to use that than formula. <br>  <br>  Good luck. I know how hard this is, to feel like you're failing your daughter at one of the most basic things you're supposed to do as a mother....and you should be rewarded and applauded for the effort you're making to make sure you do have enough milk for her.  You're terrific for trying.|`|bd5ca4564ee33749d2a59d4dca6d0270aa	I took Reglan one time to try and increase my supply. It made me very jittery and hyper. So I stopped taking it. Now that may not nessesarily be a side effect you will have but it's one I had.|`|ic2B0y7zaa	My best friend used the medication i think its called reglan. And it worked really well for her. She produced enough milk to feed all of her kids! She used it for like 9 or 10 months. Her son is perfect!|`|lD0VcAlpaa	I had milk supply problems, and they put me on Reglan (metoclopramide).

Ccq8zEcnaa	Wow you are being kind of selfish don't you think? You think your wife wants to get stretch marks? Unfortunately if it is in her DNA to get them she will.. And you should be there to support her and tell her they don't look bad when she turns to you for advice. Quit thinking about how you would make love to your wife, and appreciate her for who she is and that she is carrying your child... And not for what she looks like! EDIT: and I agree with everyone else, that's even if you have a wife considering your retarded questions and answers you post on here.. I mean how old are you anyways? 14?|`|bxlYleZkaa	Almost certainly your wife will get stretch marks and probably other things you will find not to your liking too!

Try thinking of them as the beautiful marks of pregnancy which she and you can grow to love. They are NOT ugly. They are part of the life giving process called pregnancy. As it is your wife who will ultimately have to live with them, try being supportive. The chance she will get some are pretty high. Saying that, not everyone gets them and she may well escape. Buy her some cocoa butter and rub it on her tummy every night before bed. And try to look in her eyes when you have sex. If you really can't bear it, try some new positions! Good luck to your wife!!!|`|AA11783671	There's no way to keep her from getting them.  It helps to not overeat and gain tons of fat while pregnant, but otherwise, they happen or they don't.  And if she exercises and gets herself back to "normal" weight after the pregnancy, they will fade.  It may take time (mine were about 9 mo), but they did fade a whole lot.  You've just got to get past it and realize they're marks of motherhood and being a mom should make her more sexy in your eyes.|`|qImMwhUHaa	You think SHE wants to look like that? Geez, how shallow. I'd say she has a bout a 75% chance or more that she will get stretch marks. It depends on how much elastin she has in her skin and how much weight she gains and how big she currently is. tiny little people tend to get more stretch marks from stretching so much. I got stretch marks with my first child but they pretty much faded away and aren't very visible.  Be a little more supportive of your wife please!|`|HwB5ZWq5aa	Usually the stretch markes never get longer than the partners penis so you really don't have anything to worry about!|`|kvYgopThaa	please for all woman kind, don't get married until you grow up and mature!

Sorry.|`|dNL4n2oGaa	I think her pregnant. That's kinda weird..<br>  But um did you do it? That's creepy but um stick up to the pain you're go through.|`|dVAiuqZCaa	It sounds like you might be prego.Well at least your mom knows so she can help you.So many young girls on here are too scared to tell their parents.Well what else can I say but good luck!|`|VN6BeCUfaa	I am positive that you are pregnant. Good luck.|`|aJjV5b95aa	It sounds like you may be pregnant, but you should calm down until you know for sure. Accidents happen. I was 14 when I had my son. I am not saying that it is a good thing I am letting you know that things like this happen and it really depends on the way you handle it. Things will be okay if you are pregnant it is something you are going to have to deal with if you are not pregnant us this as you wake up call to get on birth control and use condoms. Good Luck and if you need to talk you can e-mail me believe me you are not the first 14 year old to think that you are pregnant and you will not be the last.|`|M5nCDbdhaa	what we think?isn't it obvious?<br>  and peeing a  lot comes later in the pregnancy as the baby weights a lot and presses on ur bladder,so ur either lying or just plain odd since u wanna know what we think of a 14 year old being pregnant?<br>  i am 15 and i cant even imagine myself having sex.good luck to you,and i do mean that....<br>  <br>  p.s ur name? is it polish/Russian?|`|RvOilUZjaa	if ur having ur period, ur probably not!<br>  tell us if you are tomorrow though!|`|gNaGdJzzaa	well i think your prego...uh oh...;(well you shoudlnt be having sex at your age i wouldnt picture myself having sex im turning 14..its just so weird like at this age so strange...its like a horror film to me|`|m9g6tBqiaa	Possible- you may just wait and see. period usually dosent come during pregnancy though!|`|cdAQZJGpaa	idk its hard to tell but u could be!
Ge7MnE5Eaa	I'm guessing you've ovulated already since you're asking about signs of pregnancy. <br>  Well, the yellow cm is from the corpus luteum, the little egg, and it means it has not been fertilized and that in a week or so you should get your period.<br>  I'm sorry. :(  <br>  I have, however, heard of women who had yellowish cm and then were pregnant, anyway!  <br>  <br>  if you're itching "down there" or it smells different, then it could be an infection.. <br>  <br>  best wishes to you. :)|`|Y2WMKpHjaa	yellow cm means that you might have an infection. <br>  <br>  i would go get checked out. <br>  <br>  or it could be this<br>  <br>  To me, it sounds like egg white CM and you may be fertile and about to ovulate on your own. I get HUGE blobs of it also around O time and it has been clear, yellowish, brownish and pink and I often have a little spotting during the same time. I hope your body is gonna O on it's own and that is all it is. If you are trying to get pregnant, then take advantage and do the deed! Best of luck to you!
PwHWJkcYaa	You can get them at Tammy girl, New Look or H&M. Any 'teen' clothes store sells bra and knicker sets now and they range in sizes, age and style, so you should find something. <br>  My 10 year old cousin has a silky bra and knicker set from New Look, it's pale pink with little white ribbons printed on. Her mum only lets her wear them on special occasions though, to stop her 'growing up too fast'.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	<a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10811848" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10811851" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10811854" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605_029B0922000P" rel="nofollow">http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605_029B0909000P" rel="nofollow">http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605_029B0911000P" rel="nofollow">http://www.sears.com/shc/s/p_10153_12605...</a><br>  <br>  I think those are kinda what you're looking for, Hope I helped! :)|`|6nUprmu5aa	Try an undershirt instead. 9 year olds don't need bras unless they are bigger in that area and you said she's flat-chested. Wait until she's 11 or 12.|`|3kRnw3eNaa	Walmart has a lot of different sizes and styles.|`|Afj1GGptaa	I got one for my little girl at Walmart and Target.

ge43YJoeaa	Some manufacturers do make an entire line of gear that matches.  Some gear may only have a few items that match such as the stroller, car seat, & pack-and-play.  Try going to Gracobaby.com, selecting Products, and scroll down to Collections.  Then you will see different patterns that you can click on and it will tell you what type of gear that comes in that pattern.  You can then find out where the products are sold.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think it's a good idea to try to match everything because your basis of choosing that particular stroller, for example, is just because it matches everything else, not because it's the best stroller.  I almost registered for a matching collection but realized that I'd be forced to pick something that matches instead of looking for a high-quality item that meets my needs.|`|vr9Nd9Gbaa	Very possible.  Check Toys R Us or even Target.  Graco and Evenflo are two major names that come to mind and both have lines that include all the equipment and even matching diaper bags and blankets.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|lD0VcAlpaa	It is possible. Chicco and Graco both make themed sets of everything, I'm sure other brands too. However, it's not essential and sometimes it's not budget smart. However, if she can afford it and it makes her happy, why not!|`|LvbizUcwaa	yes you can but its prob going to be expensive!!!|`|1m7eGZdeaa	its kind of obsessive if you ask me.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	of course its possible. i know graco sells matching sets and i'm pretty sure evenflo does aswell.|`|vZwJyqc6aa	It depends on if the design she likes comes in all these things you listed. I guess it's possible but it would be VERY hard to find something to match everything. She sounds extremely picky to me! It will never happen. She will get all kinds of miscellaneous  things at the shower. She can't be too choosy when she's getting stuff for free!|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I have a matching car seat, stroller diaper bag, and pack and play. It is pretty pointless though. I mean who is going to see the stroller, and pack and play, or high chair together. If she wants them just because she REALLY likes the pattern, then I would understand. If she just wants them because, then I would say, she could save a lot of money bargain shopping, even if it results in different patterns!|`|oiJITSNZaa	Yes and if you go with Graco brand its a quality brand and reasonably priced.<br>  I have a matching swing, high chair, car seat. and know you can get a stroller, pack andplay and diaper bag too.<br>  I'm a graco fan...I have two strollers...a double one and a umbrellla one and love them. Even evenflo doesn't beat the way they handle.<br>  If you're going to buy all new anyways I figured they might as well be matching it doesn't cost any more! My favorite place is Babiesrus.<br>  Good Luck!|`|w3ob12X6aa	i have all matching stroller, carseat, and pack and play, and theres a highchair that matches my stuff but i dont have it so yeah i dont know about a diaper bag, you can match your stuff with it just maybe not completely|`|7ZMmQhWraa	Some brands make travel systems with carseats.

XRLbqtUbaa	My child.  He would want me to also.  Apart of him would live on forever through our baby.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  That lady sounds like she has issues..to me it's not just that simple (did she even have kids?).|`|IFDfpbFJaa	My child for sure. It's my JOB to protect my child. and I have already had this convo with my significant other and he knows that he better save our son before he tries to save me. I would miss my boyfriend very very much but it's nature to protect your children and as a mother I wouldn't be able to live with myself if my child had died in my boyfriends place.|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	I would choose my child. FOR SURE! I always ask questions like this to my husband. I would expect him to do the same. Yes, you could always have more children but it will never be the child you let go and I don't know how anyone could live with that guilt. And if you want to get technical, you could always find another spouse. Not that that would be on anyone's mind right after losing one. Lets just hope nobody has to make this decision. It would be horrible.|`|aJjV5b95aa	I would save my child because I know that is what he would want and I would want him to do the same. We are not married but we have been together for 4 year and know each other very well and we have talk about scenarios similar to this one.|`|d0836e0785bb7c6faea2b62558249361aa	It would depend on who has the larger life insurance policy.<br>  <br>  Just kidding...

I don't think there really is a right and a wrong, and I believe most people would have a really hard time admitting the truth to how they really feel, one way or the other.  <br>  <br>  I took a psychology class and an assignment was to list your preferences in order.  The correct order was God, yourself, your spouse, your children, your friends and family.  It worked that way because God is always first, then yourself because without yourself you couldn't take care of anything else down the list.  Your spouse is next because without him/her you couldn't take care of your children properly.  Apparently your relationship with your spouse is more important in regards to raising your children in a loving home.  However, my personal opinion is that I would consider my children first.<br>  <br>  I would have to save my child.  It's a mother's natural instinct.  If I were drowning along with my child, I would want my husband to save my child instead of me.  They say the worst thing a person can go through in life is losing a child.  Husbands can be replaced!!  haha j/k

qSmCA82Aaa	<--------Well obviously I am fine with it!  Just like Olivia said there are thousands of children around and i dont see someone stalking you and hunting you down over a little avator pic!   And if by some miracoulous chance they did then they would have to kill me before touching my children,   I have a myspace thats set to private where only my friends can see that but no no big deal.<br>    If someone wants to send you an email and call you a bad mom for it then honestly take it as a compliment bc that just means thier pathetic and can't find anything else wrong to say to you!|`|ZCSOJUYVaa	OMG! Wow, I am seriously shocked that someone would say something. Its not like we are giving out the childs first, middle, last name, dob, or street address. Some people way over react. SO I guess that means I should no longer upload pictures onto myspace or photobucket for fear that my children will be ripped out of my home. Now seriously come on now people! Lol, I just cant stop laughing. Yes, we are tough cookies, and it would have been just a tad bit hilarious if you had included the name, but we are civilized adults that just happen to take pictures of our kiddos!|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Ok it doesnt make you a bad mother...but i just dont do it for safety reasons.  I see some DUMB people though that take pics of their kids and like...some information about is on the photo like their full name, or home address.  Theres so many child predators out there just LOOKING for stuff like that....so yea i personally wouldnt put my kids pics up but i wouldnt call you a bad motherfor doing it.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Well I dont post ANY.  Obviously a child can't be kidnapped this way, but  I just don't like the idea that others can save to them their computer and do whatever they wish with them.  Whether it's pretending that their theirs or something perverted.  Too many weird people out there.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	As long as the pics are of the kids naked, or holding up a credit card statement complete with address, phone number and all private info it's good. Some of the best laughs I've gotten were from people sharing funny or cute pics of their kids on Yahoo.|`|6nUprmu5aa	I think that's a complete over reaction. If a predator sees you entering your home, it's much easier for them than to go through the trouble of looking up your IP address. I haven't posted any pictures of my kids on here, but lots of users do....|`|vGxipYJnaa	I don't understand that either. There are kids literally everywhere - why would someone travel to your house to take yours (if they could figure out where your house even is).|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I have pictures of my children up all over the internet.  And other people's children too (with their permission, I'm a photographer).<br>  <br>  I think taking reasonable precautions in real life is a lot safer than worrying about someone finding your children because of pictures online.  I even have my real name and phone number posted online (again, it's part of my business).  I've never even received a phone call that's not business related.<br>  <br>  I joke all the time that if someone was to take my children, they'd bring them back after a few hours anyway... :)<br>  <br>  Why would a child predator look for kid online instead of just snatching one from the local grocery store or park or whatever?  It just doesn't make any sense.  These people are going to go the easiest route to take a child, and that is not looking for a picture of one online and trying to figure out where they live. <br>  <br>  Unless, of course, they are looking for a specific child.  if I had a crazy baby's daddy out there, I wouldn't put pictures online either.<br>  <br>  The only predators I've ever heard of that look online are those soliciting sex to teens and preteens.  When the CHILD is actually online, not their parents.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	Omg! Someone obviously has too much time on their hands...<br>  Yep she is definitely right,  it's soo easy to find and abduct someones child from that tiny picture, because you totally have your full names, and address posted on the pic for the whole world to see! <br>  <br>  People here crack me up to :)Did you reply to her?? He/she sounds like they have a real problem. As long as you're not posting pics with things like school uniforms or anything that would clue someone in to where you live, I really don't see the problem.|`|oMVSKGKbaa	Is it wise, no not really. Is one small photo going to attract a predator, it's doubtful. I am much more concerned about being in a public place like Wal-Mart. Any pervert can follow you home as most would be unsuspecting, then all he/she has to do is wait for the right opportunity.<br>  <br>  If THAT avatar is the picture I am laughing with you!|`|ixmaM395aa	Oh my gosh you're a terrible mother! What were you thinking?<br>  <br>  Deary me, some people just have far too much time on their hands. Yes a predator is really going to snatch your child up from this picture... because underneath that picture it must state the childs name, age & address. <br>  <br>  It's totally laughable! At least you can see the humour in this. Granted this woman will have pictures of her child up on either a facebook/myspace/some kind of personal friend site. <br>  <br>  It's funny, thanks for the giggle.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I don't put pictures of my son on the internet because one day, when he is famous, I am planning on selling them for lots and lots of money and I do not want anyone to have a sneak peak or, God forbid, download them and sell them to the paparazzi.

You can't be too careful, but the avatar is no big deal. And it's up to each person as to their comfort level with it. Just because I take the approach I do about it doesn't make you a bad mother. <br>  <br>  LMAO that you posted that message ... hee hee!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	From the small little bitty thumb nail you have on here? that's lame.

AiJeS6I1aa	Dairy products should not be introduced until 9-12 months of age.  But, you are right to think that yogurt would be beneficial... just not in an infant of his age.<br>  <br>  Yes, yogurt contains bacterial cultures, but these are beneficial cultures and not infective cultures - there are many different species of bacteria - some good, some bad, some in between.  The bacterial cultures in yogurt help to re-establish the good bacterial colony in a gut after it has been demolished with the antibiotics.|`|kdUYrrPVaa	dont give him yogurt, he doesn't need any extra "cultures" in his intestines right now, just keep that area clean, dry as possible and keep using the neosporin......the yogurt may make it worse|`|MQ34YW28aa	There probably isn't anything you can do if his antibiotic is giving him dierrhea. It's really common for that to happen. Just gotta be on top keeping his penis clean. Maybe putting gauze over it too then that way it help prevent some of the dierreah to get in there. Good luck!! Take care<br>  <br>  Edit: I would call up his doctor and ask him about the yogurt. I don't think it would hurt him, but do it just to make sure. But they probably wont recommend anything because that's just a side effect of antibiotics.|`|AA10371609	Neosporin is a topical agent and will not cause diarrhea.<br>  <br>  The bacteria in the yogurt will not cause it either.<br>  <br>  Just keep the area clean.  Keep using the neosporin.  And make sure he stays hydrated.

Literary: the name of the lost love of Edmond Dantes in Dumas's "The Count of Monte Cristo". Also the name of the German luxury car, which was named for a little girl named Mercedes.

Tjr9aObNaa	I think one of the main reasons could be that, but me personally, i hate domestic adoption which is just like a 'baby market'|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Hi, DorisLilian!<br>  <br>  Everyone has their own reasons. Some of them are selfish and some of them are not. <br>  <br>  "I believe adoption should benefit the child first and foremost!"<br>  <br>  YOU are absolutely correct! Adoption SHOULD be about the needs of the child.<br>  <br>  However, there ARE cases where international adoption might NOT be selfish.  For example: Kinship IA - which is rare but DOES happen is NOT selfish in my opinion. <br>  <br>  There is always an "exception to the rule" because every adoption, just like every person, is different and each should be weighed on its own merits.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	There are not enough unwanted domestic babies to satisfy demand.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Having adopted both internationally and domestically I can say that for my wife and I adopting internationally had nothing at all to do with keeping birth parents from tracking down a child or having a situation where my daughter could not search for her birth parents.  I believe that is a misconception held by many people but I don't believe that is the case for many people who adopt internationally.<br>  <br>  We chose to adopt internationally because we were living overseas and we saw the conditions in which orphans were living in and we saw that there was not much interest within the country for adoptions.  All of this essentially condemns a child to life in an orphanage if they are luck enough to live through the experience.  Had we been home and required to pay the exorbitant prices for international adoptions we would have remained people who wanted to do something about the orphans but who couldn't afford to do anything.  <br>  <br>  In our case, and in any of the cases I personally know of, the adoption did benifit the child first and foremost.  Had my daughter not been adopted by us when we did she would not have survived in the orphanage.  She was seriously malnourished and was not going to last long.  We were able to remove her from that environment, provide her with the basics of life (and I'm talking food, vitamins and attention not rainbows and ponies) she would have continued to waste away.  As it stands, in spite of our best efforts, she has permanent cognitive delays and while she is doing very well in a modified school program she will most likely require lifelong care and supervision to keep her safe and healthy.  <br>  <br>  Would we go back and change anything if we could?  Sure.  We'd have gotten her out sooner if we could or at least see to it that she received the basics of life sooner in the hopes that she would not have these disabilities.  Since we can't change the past we have always just looked forward to ensure that our children come first.  We would still have adopted her without hesitation even if we knew where things would go as she got older.  In our case the love is unconditional.  <br>  <br>  Are there those who shop the international adoption market looking for their child of choice?  I'm sure there are, just as there are those who do it with the domestic market.  Do the majority of people who adopt internationally do it for the self serving reasons noted in the question?  I honestly don't believe so or there wouldn't be so many children with special needs being adopted from overseas regardless of their ages.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	I think it's selfish AND morally wrong to adopt a child from a foreign country. It robs the child of everything- their language, their country, their family, their everything. International is full of corruption, even more so than domestic. <br>   <br>  Foreign governments KNOW what kind of money barren American women will pay for  child. Because of this, women are raped, then the child is sold to "adoption brokers". Babies are also kidnapped and sold into adoption. Dont kid yourself. It happens. Every day. The "baby was found in a basket on the agency doorstep" is a very common story these twits make up, and rarely is it true.<br>   <br>  And, BTW, ap's may think they can "secure the child as their own forever", but they are kidding themselves. The child also has ANOTHER set of parents who are theirs forever.  <br>   <br>  If someone truly wants to be a parent, they will adopt through foster care from their own country. If they don't have foster care in their country, move or become a mentor.<br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/adoptedthemovie" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/adoptedthemo...</a><br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opinions/outlook/2009-01-11/adoption/" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opi...</a><br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/09/AR2009010903118.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...</a><br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2004/4/emw117838.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2004/...</a><br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12185524" rel="nofollow">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opinions/outlook/2009-01-11/adoption/" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opi...</a> <br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27859660" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27859660</a>   <br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4508&page=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.p...</a><br>   <br>  Just because a child is available for "adoption" in a foreign country, doesn't make the adoption legal, or moral.|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	I have relatives who have adopted a child from the UK, the system is arduos and lengthy and can be heartbreaking.  Every aspect of their lives was put on display to all and sundry to see if they would make suitable parents, and there is beaurocracy beyond belief.  It put a real strain on their relationship.   From what I have read it seems that adoption from abroad may be an easier process.  Aslo here in the UK most people want to adopt a baby, suprisingly there are very few babies who are put up for adoption, in the main it's children aged 2 and above.  Personally, I wouldn't adopt from abroad, there are many children in care here in the UK that need stable homes.  I also think that people assume children in foster care here in the UK are better care for than say children in a third world orphanage.  This is just my opinion though, I have no real facts to back it up.|`|AKJwWqdZaa	We adopted our daughter from China and our son from foster care and I do not believe that adopting overseas was anymore selfish than adopting from foster care. We adopted because we wanted to be parents. Selfish? Sure. Just as selfish as any biological parents deciding to get pregnant. They want to be parents too. We did not adopt from China to keep her all to ourselves. We wanted to adopt children who did not have parents. And as far as I am concerned, as long as there are children languishing in deplorable 2nd and 3rd world orphanages with no one in their native country who are willing or able to adopt them, then IA needs to exist. There isn't too much in the way of culture and tradition being passed around in orphanages, they are in the business of survival.|`|a695392f1d08cb51892a2580128302a2aa	Those could be the reasons behind some people wanting to adopt from overseas. Other reasons could be  to give a family to a child who has none. To provide parents and a home to a child who has none. To provide a good future and way of life for a child who lives in poverty. To provide medical care for a child who wouldn't otherwise have it. <br>  Not everyone adopt only babies from other countries.  Not everyone adopts only perfectly healthy children either.  People who think adopting internationally is easier than domestic are very misinformed.  To provide a loving home and family to a child who has none, no matter where they are from, is a good thing.  Adopting from a third world country is giving a child a chance for a good life!|`|bYrGGOynaa	My parents adopted me because my grandfather told them it would be an honor to adopt a child from the country I was born in, where he fought in a war. I do not think it is selfish at all. That is kind of an immature train of thought. There are many, many more children without families in other countries.|`|hGY08GjRaa	Ah yes.. of course, Lauriel ad cant'stop that IS... MUST be the reason for adopting overseas... <br>  <br>  Let's just once again judge ALL Aps (or aps who adopted a certain way) without knowing their situation or their heart. Absoltutely! Let's put them ALL into a neat little "selfish greedy" box.. as if we don't do that enough every day.. after all, dontcha know ALL Aps and ALL adoptions are the same?  <br>  <br>  course you knew that..|`|0x8Q6rFPaa	That IS the reason some people adopt from overseas.  I know this because many such people are not shy about saying so, often using delightful terms like "birth mama drama." <br>  <br>  I find that sickening.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I would think the main reason is that there are far more orphans in further countries as a result of abandonment, parents death, etc etc.<br>  It's not selfish at all - in fact I think it's selfless.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I don't think thats the reason for everyone.<br>  <br>  We all have different passions in life. Different things we feel connected to and have a desire to work with, etc. <br>  <br>  For some they are drawn to other countries and adopt because of that. A friend of mine plans to adopt her next child from Jamaica because its her favorite place in the world. She loves everything about it and would like to live there one day. So for her thats part of her reason for adopting from there and not the US. <br>  <br>  For some they feel they are doing something that really helps a child who will otherwise be in an orphanage. Many of which are very under staffed, under funded and are not the place any child should be raised. Compare that to children in the US who are in homes with families while they wait for adoption. A friend adopted from China and the orphanages there are less than what any child deserves. The people working were wonderful but the housing was terrible. Our family donated thousands to the orphanages there when they were out of electricity for weeks and supplies running so low they didn't know what to do. It was dire and for some that is why they want to adopt from there. The need is higher as far as safety is concerned. <br>  <br>  For some it may be because those children truly have no one who will take them in their own family due to whatever reason (poverty, death, war, government policy, etc).<br>  <br>  Some may adopt because there is very little chance of ever finding a family and they want to protect themselves from that but I just do not believe that that is the main reason.
sK67bBy5aa	With my first I gained 25 llbs and had 2 stretch marks. With my 2nd, I gained 50 llbs, maybe got 4 more...And I just found out I am pregnant with my 3rd...so I'll have to get back with you on that one...lol The way I eat, I will have tons!! lol<br>  <br>  All the stretch marks I have are very very small!|`|v3LnJycKaa	i gained 14 with my first and got maybe 4 or 5 stretch marks very low and already gone (5 years later) with my second i gained 18 pounds and didnt get any stretch marks... all the luck of the draw stay hydrated!|`|28fNd725aa	Hi there~ I am a mom of 3, and for me it didn't seem to matter how much weight I gained or didn't gain, with the 1st I gain'd like 70lbs, with the 2nd only 17 and with the 3rd just under 50.  And I got strech marks with all three.  But I've always had a positive attitude about them, I've always told the kids that those were my mommy badges!! lol kinda silly, but made me feel some better.  And now 2 years later, my strech marks are all faded ... I hardly even notice them!<br>  <br>  Good Luck! Enjoy your pregnancy and babies and don't worry about the strech marks!!|`|pcb8watraa	It's really more about genetics than anything else. If your family members had stretch marks you will probably have them. Both my sister and I made it through pregnancy no 1 with little marks but our 2nd pregnancies destroyed us. Weight really doesn't matter as much as how you carry the baby. With my first I had a girl, gained 40lbs and carried high. With my second it was a boy and I only gained 26lbs but it was all in my stomach like a basketball, really low. It stretched out the skin a lot. I am having my third in 3 days and after this one I am sure to be eligible to be on display in a museum for what you don't want to happen to your body because of baby. I am a mess. So hopefully you will be better off then me but don't worry too much about it. There is nothing you can do to change it except for surgery.|`|9P8WJVNsaa	I gained 42 lbs with my first and 34 lbs with my second.  My first was a boy and my tummy was wider than it was sticking out.  Most of my stretch marks with the first were on the side and lower part of my tummy.  <br>  <br>  With my second child, my tummy stuck out big time but I was narrow on the sides.  Because of this, I now have stretch marks around my bellybutton.<br>  <br>  My second is only a month old, so I think as my tummy goes down, I may discover more.  I hate them, but what can you do, right?|`|tnTxHVO5aa	I gained more weight with the second but got more stretch marks with the first|`|FYDw1rjlaa	I gained 20 lbs with my son and only have a little stretch mark on both side of my stomach only. I gained 15 lbs with my daughter and my stretch still look the same like when I have my son so I am happy so far. With my third one on the way, I hope I don't get more stretch mark.
YQrKQ5PAaa	It's not unrealistic at all. I think it's great that you want to get into movies and make your dream come true. The thing is, you need to tell your mom that straight up. Be like... Mom, you know, I've always thought working in the movie industry would be amazing... And kind of go from there. Oh, I guess kind of make it more obvious you want to help MAKE them than be IN them. :P <br>  <br>  If it were my child, I would probably do some research on it, talk to them about it, and make sure it's still something they really want to do. Then, I would probably get them involved in something that would help them get some training/prep for it in the future.|`|h8OqX12Haa	i kinda have the same thing happening to me my parents are forcing me into health or business or accounting  but thats not what i wanna od i wanna go to vet tech school <br>  <br>  as for that you can always move to USA its not that far  away|`|PdcQyis5aa	just be honest with them and do research your best bet is to get as much info as you can about the career that you want and bring that to them.    good luck|`|lTsPX04jaa	just come out and tell her|`|CdJtH0xdaa	It's YOUR future, not your mother's. Just remember that when you tell her that you want to work in the film industry. If she's disappointed, just tell her bluntly that it's YOUR future, and you can do whatever you want to. You should not let your mother rule over you; she is your mother forever, but she does not have to be the boss your whole life. Best of luck to you. As far as what I want my son to be when he grows up, I don't have a care in the world what he wants to be. If he wants to be a firefighter, a dancer, a singer, a waiter, a professional skydiver, I couldn't care less. As long as he WANTS to do something with his life, and doesn't waste it on drugs and such, I don't care what he does with it. As long as he's happy.|`|m9g6tBqiaa	All I can say is to follow your dreams. Nothing is impossible =] i have had experience- my ma wanted me 2 b a mechanic. we talked it out and she understood! it is ur future, so take control! but b nice, also!!|`|dDHtziQEaa	just do porn|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	My children can be whatever they desire ASLONG as there is College involved in getting you there.<br>  Like with film, as friend of mine works at a gaming and movie shop (quite big in my country) full-time, but before he got into it he was in film school. He passed with flying colours.<br>  Now he does movies and camera work as a hobby, and one day when he's really pro, he's going to introduce himself into the industry.<br>  No dream is unrealistic, it just takes a lot of hard work and dedication to get to where you want to be.<br>  Your mother is setting HER dreams into your future.<br>  You need to explain that your talent wouldn't be wasted in what you do, but you just want to be in the movie industry. Tell her that they are her dreams for you, not yours, and that YOU are your own person. Don't forget to remind her that you love her and are greatful for her input but it IS your decision.
B5MDTdtPaa	i had heavy 5 day periods befor pregnancy...now my daughters 5 months old and ive had 4periods since her birth...all light lasting only 2-3 days... i was terrified i was pregnant but did numerous tests and asked the doctor to test twice in different months - all were negative..he said menstrual variations can happen as you body changes after birth|`|lD0VcAlpaa	Everything is probably normal, but if you're worried it's best to talk to your OB as soon as you can. Your cycle changes after having a baby and will probably become less predictable for the next few months, you shouldn't expect to become regular for a good 6-8 months.

e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	Everyone has different pain thresholds.  No one can really share their experience with someone else.  I'll say to you what I've told many moms, if something worries you, listen to your mother's instinct before and after birth.  If you really think it's BH drink more fluid and relax more.  If you are worried, call your doctor.  It's better to be seen six times on a false alarm than ignore something even once that may be serious.|`|NTfIJa7zaa	I think that you may want to consult your doctor if the contractions are hurting this bad. It may be a sign of preterm labor.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your baby!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I first got BH around 26 weeks too.

It's a little different since you're not at home. You just want to make sure you aren't making the coaches or kids uncomfortable.|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	Think of it this way, if you would be offended if another mother was wearing it to the lessons, don't wear it.

LZK4TqTAaa	It would be odd for you to have normal/regular cycles, then all of a sudden get PCOS. If you've gained a lot of weight that could negatively affect your cycles, also pregnancy messes them up as well. You're breastfeeding which can also halt menses.<br>  There are tons of symptoms of PCOS, most doctors will not diagnose you unless you have a few of them. They'll also want to run blood tests to see if you have high testosterone, LH & FSH issues, low progesterone, etc.<br>  Since you've just had a baby and are still breastfeeding I would wait until you stop breastfeeding to see if your cycle returns. If not, then I would be concerned.

1bLZgVPMaa	Ask her if anything has been going wrong in her life. Start talking about things you've noticed change about her and then tell her what you think she should do about it. make sure the convo it private and on the phone.
2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	all of these people who are saying its not right are ridiculous!!!<br>  my goodness haven't you ever taken a bath with your son and why is that so diffrent. ITS NOT.<br>  <br>  i used to take showers with my dad when he was rushing or when we went camping and stuff probably till i was like 7 or 8 and i cant really remember, i do remember one other time, him telling me to turn around cause i was asking questions while we were camping..haha<br>  <br>  you have to do what you have to do...|`|c6RGmMGjaa	Well as a mother I still sometimes  bathe with my 5 year old son so I don't really see why it's so wrong the other way around, there's nothing pervy about it as some are trying to suggest. When we do it now he always sits behind me and after I've washed etc I'll get out and leave him to play for a while, it works very well for us and saves on water. I think that once the kids hit around 6 then it should be phased out (that's probably what I'll do) but I'm sure I'll still be helping him with hair washing and drying off. It's really up to the child in question and the parents how they carry out their routines, there's no golden rules on this and it's not wrong wrong wrong at all.|`|1S7uXsInaa	In my home we do not make a big deal out of being naked, it was like that in my house when I was growing up as well.  My husband and my 5 year old will sometimes shower together with my 11 month old son.  Especially when I work late, she is a big help watching her younger brother while my husband washes.  There is no awkwardness between the 2 of them, and why should there be.  Being naked is not a bad thing and if you try and hide that you make it taboo.|`|BRT2teSqaa	I'd say that should stop at 3/4 if the parent is of opposite gender, but it can last longer if they are the same sex.  Maybe then until about 5/6<br>  <br>  Some are saying 8 years old, and that is WAY too old in my opinion.|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Um, I don't really think you should be. That's the point of those sweet little bath things that stick in a bath. I only know that toddlers can have baths with their sibling.|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	As soon as she begins to show signs of modesty.  At around five or so girls will start to cover their chests if exposed to males.  At least that has been my experience.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Erm, well I don't think a child should have to see their father naked, so bathing with dad is kinda out of the question.|`|3a37c6d3eb9e914f155df7ad545276f4aa	As long as she can be held in the shower usually about 2 years.  After that they start wondering what that thing is.|`|57yUAgfAaa	well I think up to about age 8 it is ok to still bathe your daughter, but as they get older, you should be encouraging them to wash themselves so it'd be more supervision than actually bathing them!  I think once a child is able to talk, you shouldn't bathe with them as they are at an age where they start to remember stuff and this also avoids embarassment if they go telling teachers etc about daddy's bits and pieces.  However, I think it is never proper for a father to bath with his daughter, there's just something kinda wrong about that.|`|hYQTOabRaa	I don't think it is appropriate for a child (post infancy, you'll know when) to see the opposite sex parent naked (for a son, obviously, sometime after he is weaned).  It didn't seem to be a matter for concern when my daughter was an infant but a day came, somewhere around 15 months I think, when I, as a mother, just instinctively felt it was no longer appropriate.  Obviously, children open doors without knocking and the day will come when we have the opportunity to explain to her why daddy looks different then mommy and her.  But for now there is no need for it to be an issue.<br>  As for same sex parents - for those of you who don't understand why that would be o.k. - When I was little my mom never hid herself from me.  I remember feeling a sense of security, somehow, from seeing that my mom and I were similar and when my body started to change I was in no way suprised by any of it.  I embraced becoming more like my mom.|`|hUbNKOTsaa	men should never take showers/baths with his daughter that is sick and perverted. batheing the kid is one thing but taking a bath WITH his daughter is sick and perverted...watching her to make she gets clean and washes the shampoo out of her hair is fine, but I dont beleive kids she someone of the opposite gender naked unless they are very very young, like under three. same gender taking a shower with should stop at 5 but as for watching her you no longer need to supervise her when she can wash herself without help and remembers to wash everywhere and there is no shampoo left in her hair when she is done this is usually around 6-8|`|Y8uqufezaa	we have 3 children 2 girls, and a boy my husband never took showers or baths w/ them I always had a small tub to bathe them in this is more a job for mom than dad I think as it doesn't seem right for dad to be taking a bath or shower w/ there daughter unless shes an infant, and you absolutly have to but after she's like 9 mo. knock it off or you'll have trouble on your hands. I know you want to keep them safe thats why when our kids take a shower we have them keep the door slightly ajar so that we can check on them to make sure they're not drowning, but they take showers instead of baths.

Our society is so sexualized, it's very sad really.  Your daughter will let you know when it's time to stop, by her behavior.  Kids naturally want privacy at some point, the actual age will vary from kid to kid.  It should be well before the onset of puberty, however, to avoid any misunderstandings.  Or if they are making comments, for instance yelling things at church about your various and sundry body parts.<br>  I took one bath with my son when he was a baby, but I only did it once because it just wasn't practical.  I shower with my kids now they're a little older, too, 5 and 2.  <br>  As far as giving your daughter a bath, as long as she needs help, it is ok for you to help her.  Once she is old enough to do everything herself, washing behind her ears, getting all the shampoo out of her hair, etc., she won't need your help or anyone else's.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	wow alot of you women must have perverted husbands ..there is nothing wrong with nudity or showering with your child ..I say age 4 is time to stop but ..really whatever youre comfortable with up to age 8.

Co- Sleeping is a great opportunity for bonding with you new family...|`|ORpbq3bAaa	me and my boyfriend do the same thing. i am living at his parents house and we stay in his room and my baby has her little bassinet. my baby sleeps threw the night so we get time to be intimate quietly of course. we are also trying to move out but only my boyfriend works right now and i know we cant afford it right.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	We had a twin bed in our son's room where I used to co sleep.

Or even when the baby is  awake and occupied with something in a safe place. We have done this a few times!|`|EeGgovyCaa	Yes we are<br>  <br>  And agree the bed is not the only place to have sex.

People have paid me for my scrap booking services before though.<br>  <br>  But being a stay at home mom is not so bad for a living if you ask me :)  The "pay" is great.  Kisses, laughter, hugs, snuggles, and the such are pretty nice on a daily basis.  Honestly, what workplace lets you snuggle your boss, lol?<br>  <br>  My husband is a crane technician.  He works on all kinds of cranes and does electrical and mechanics.  His line of work is pretty difficult if you ask me.  Too many numbers and mechanics to keep up with, lol.  His job can also be dangerous.  A guy actually feel into a machine a lost his life in a warehouse he was doing inspections in.

Prior to having my son, I worked in desktop support for an airline here, basically helping pilots get online with their laptops and helping gate attendants get their boarding pass printers turned back on. I was a contractor there and trying hard to get hired permanently for the free flight benefits. Then I got pregnant and decided to stay home when the baby was born.<br>  <br>  My husband works as a Usability Analyst for a bank. He spends his days learning about how people use different banking systems and figuring out ways to improve their experience. He used to be a computer programmer for the Air Force, and did that for a few years before finally getting into Usability. This has been his dream field for a very long time so he absolutely loves his job.<br>  <br>  I think my staying home is very beneficial for my son and our stepson. My husband always says that I provide a sense of security and routine around here. If not for me, they'd all be eating frozen pizza on the floor in their underwear and in front of the tv :)<br>  <br>  I love my husband's job because he's so happy with it. He gets to work from home occasionally and gets a ton of vacation time. He can come home for lunch or slip out for a few hours between meetings. He has freedom there and that works for us.|`|j2mRop0laa	My husband works in insurance (not sales) and he has an office in our home. I'm a sahm but still help him with office type work. <br>  <br>  We LOVE his career because it gives me the ability to help him out, plus he makes his own schedule and is at home 80-90% of his work time. It was really terrific when my kids were younger and he didn't miss anything going on with them.<br>  I would say we are a very close family because of my husbands career type. I always him to fall back on and sometimes I feel so guilty because I know not a lot of mommies have that.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	I'm  a single mom of two grown children and one teenager.  I don't work outside of the home the way that you're thinking of. I'm disabled but there are ways that I keep busy and help the community.  I'm an advocate for children with learning disabilites and for people with psychiatric problems.  Since it's hard for me to walk I do  a lot of my work over the net and using the phones.  I mostly help children with learning disabilites get the services that they need to be able to finish school and to do well. When the people need help getting the psychiatric services that they need they ask me to help them negotiate the hospitals and the insurance companies.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	my husband builds houses full time.  he also works his own side job business where he builds, decks, houses, siding, roofing, etc.  very handy in that way. <br>  yea it actually does.  when he works his side jobs, that means he is gone the majority of the weekends too and sometimes in the evenings when he has to bid jobs or haul materials for people.  but he does what he has to do to support his family so i try and keep any gripping down to a dual to no roar.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I am a graphic design artist and work with that in advertising. <br>  For example one of the things I do is design the wrapper on candy to make your kids and yourself wanna eat the more<br>  Sorry!

I am surrounded by numbers all day, and inundated with e-mails and phone calls about customer accounts.  I am working here because the hours are better for my son and I to have a life (I previously worked in management of customer related fields- restaurants/clubs/promotions etc) but I find it much easier to be a mom when I can spend time at home with my son.<br>  <br>  This job is a cake walk compared to what I have done and I enjoy it at this point in my life it was time to give up the night life and "cocktails after work" mentality and grow up!|`|kSZx9cY5aa	I teach, and at the same school 2 of my children attend, and on the same campus as my daughter-so we can never escape each other haha. I teach music and occasionally dance, ages 12-17 and I love it. It's very rewarding and though it's stressful and sometimes upsetting it's also a lot of fun. I'm really close to some of the kids there, they are my adopted family :) Last year I had tuesday off and on that day my 3yo would stay home with me, but on the days I work he goes to his day carer. I'm on maternity leave right now, and haven't quite decided when to go back. <br>  My husband works as an architect which is why we used to travel so much, but he's been based here now for the last 3 or so years, which is great<br>  <br>  I really love my job (most of the time), which is why I choose to work. If I was a sahm I'm not actually sure if I could cope, which is why I have so much respect for them. I'm the kind of person who needs to get up and go to work in the morning. I also like knowing that if something happened to my husband (god forbid) I know how to support myself.<br>  Cheers :)|`|xVEqBjDVaa	I am a stay at home mom, my husband is a lawyer.

62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	Lying on your side with your knees bent is likely to be the most comfortable position as your pregnancy progresses. It also makes your heart's job easier because it keeps the baby's weight from applying pressure to the large blood vessels that carry blood to and from your heart and your feet and legs. Lying on your side can also help prevent or reduce varicose veins, hemorrhoids, and swelling in your legs.<br>  <br>  Some doctors specifically recommend that pregnant women sleep on the left side. Because one of those big blood vessels is on the right side of your abdomen, lying on your left side helps keep the uterus off of it. Lying on your left side optimizes blood flow to the placenta and, therefore, your baby.|`|UjsQRzAfaa	Left side is best. Also, if you are uncomfy - get a body pillow and gently wrap it under baby and your belly and then between your knees to get some pressure off that lower back. This should help you. And with sleeping on the left side - the reasoning it it takes pressure off your main artery to you heart, easing and allowing you and baby to breathe easier. Congrats, have a safe and happy pregnacy.<br>  <br>  Lyn|`|MsipL0Mzaa	its the left side,reccomended.....im a blly sleeper so it was a hard hbit to break,but the farther along you get they want you to sleep on left side due to better blood flow to the baby,your heart and lungs.|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	Left side.

Good Luck  just remember after the belly get a little big do not lie on your back since their are so many nerves back there it may make you feel very dizzy and light headed. Once Again good Luck.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Left side is best, but right side is okay, too.|`|Um3qrVrqaa	Left side is the best.It doesn't really matter which side except that the left side gives the best circulation.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Your left side is the best though you can flip to the right side to give your left side a break!|`|6cwJi5kxaa	there is no best side to sleep on. its whatever position you feel comfortable in. trust me youre not going to hurt the baby.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	left side

SpoiledRottenToo.com has some great prices for these things.|`|2G8lOPN8aa	Why not see what options a store like Ikea has?

There are cribs with drawers under neath too...those are good.<br>  <br>  There are also convertible cribs that change into a toddler bed OR even a full sized bed when they are no longer cribs...I had one like this with a drawer underneath.  <br>  <br>  I didn't buy much for my daughter's room....just the changing table and crib....the changing table had one drawer and under that cabinets with two shelves within...I put baskets on the shelves to hold her little onesies and diapers and sleepers.  Everything else I hung in the closet... I went to the unfinished furniture and ordered a shelf to hang on the wall for displaying pictures and teddy bears and things to hang up high---under the shelve I had them put pegs for hanging clothes and hats and things.... the shelf is fairly deep and wide for displaying and keeping things you want to decorate with out of the reach of a toddler....and it's nice to have a place to hang outfits or pretty things so they are up off the floor...  I had one in my boys' nursery as well...<br>  <br>  Pehraps you can fit some kind of low storage unit under the window....something wider and low profile....even just a little bookshelf for her little books and stuffed animals you will begin to aquire...<br>  <br>  My daughter's room is really tight too... So I just went with the essentials... Oh and I had hubby install an additional rod int he closet....with a shelf above the rod for storage....so that gave me two rods for hanging clothing.... as well as a shelf above the top rod...|`|pXSKSS3daa	You don't NEED a changing table. It's convenient, yes, but if your space is limited I'd leave it out. You can change your baby on the floor, bed, couch, etc.<br>  <br>  We have a crib and a changing table/dresser combo. in our son's room. Once he can no longer fit on the changing table then it's not a big deal because it's still a dresser. However, I only change him on that at bedtime and naps. Otherwise we are downstairs and I use the couch or floor.<br>  <br>  We also have a dresser in his closet too along with a hanging organizer. Would this work for you? You don't need A LOT of things in there.|`|V6slDthdaa	I bought a crib with a changing table attached. It had three small drawers too, and it saved some room.

You change baby more than about anything else and you really need a good changing table!!!!  A dresser is also great for storing clothes and misc. We have a crib and a dresser/changer, plus some stacking blocks for toys. I hang some clothes in the closet but put most in the dresser (their clothes are small). I also had my husband put in shelves over the changing table - I keep all the stuff I need at hand for changing there. Then I store extra diapers and misc. like baby tub, mobile box,( even the pak and play when I'm not using it) under the crib. This arrangement has worked great for us.|`|955YoHvVaa	You can get by without a changing table..I have one and never used it..to me it makes sense to change baby where I am instead of going upstairs to change diaper..anyway you can just buy the crib and if you think you need a dresser lok for one on craigslist or something..I wouldn't buy one til you know you will need/use it.|`|e5CuEiPfaa	I just had a crib and a dresser for my little girl. You can just change babies anywhere, so to save space and money, I didn't buy a diaper changing table.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	Really the only things you need are the crib and the dresser. I had a changing table and never used the darn thing. I got rid of it after a few months and put diapers etc... in storage totes under the crib|`|59821ioeaa	First, you dont really need a changing table. Nobody really uses it that much, your going to change your baby where ever you are at the time and it always ends up as a place to throw clothes or other things on it. I have the crib, a dresser, a book shelf and a cart I bought from target (munchkin makes them) its on wheels and its very useful for clothes, bibs and stuff you'll use every day. You can just roll it into a corner or where ever it will fit, its very thin but tall. Other than that you really won't need much furniture until the baby gets a little older.
aCUHzMrmaa	He sounds kinda...bossy and likes thing his way (which i think is awesome cause im like that too lol), he also sounds determined I dont think that makes him a "bully"....thats a really really strong word.  He just sonds like a kid that gets frustrated when things dont go his way...you need to teach him that everyone has their own ideas...and to share, and give kids a turn and stuff like that.  I wouldnt classify it as being a bully though...and he's probably not being bullied but the other kids might just be kinda annoyed by him.|`|6nUprmu5aa	This is average preschooler behavior. I don't think it is right at all for a teacher to label a child that way. When he is mean to other children, he needs to be disciplined by both you and at school(and vise versa), preschool age children do not know right fronm wrong until we teach them.|`|VhH9RJrSaa	of course, he's your son, in your eyes nothing he does could be wrong. I dont know the situation well enough to decide whether or not he is the bully, personally though you said so yourself that he tends to be border line annoying. there is a difference between being a leader and being a brat (not that your son is one). A leader can consider other the children's opinions and idea's, and is looked to for answers. A bully is a child that wants it his way whether or not other children like it, with out giving other children the chance to lead in this case it would mean the bossy child would be a little selfish. Learning to share is a big step especially if he is the only child. How are they picking on him? what do they say or do and how does this relate to the reasons as to why the children are picking on him. What does this say about him are the questions that you need to be asking yourself. Did you consider that the children are picking on your son because he may be the bully?<br>  The teacher is only telling you what she has seen from her perspective, that doesn't always means she's right but that doesn't mean she's lying either.  She did see what she saw and thats enough to act on for a parent whether or not he was being bullied as well.  Have you asked the teacher what she has done to stop the teasing? If nothing then go up to the next power of authority. For now you need to concentrate on your son's issues.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	there is a thin line between being a champ and ...a chump|`|3xoEFFOKaa	there's only one way to find out.........<br>  ask ur son!!!!!!!!!!duh!!!!
uCLenopbaa	i am planning on doing the same thing.<br>  start giving her a bottle more often, limit the breast to a few times a day, and every few days give her another bottle to replace the breast. she will learn eventually. make sure you still spend lots of time with her, so she doesn't feel neglected!|`|ogdm7RLYaa	That seems selfish of you :/ Breastfeeding is the healthiest things for your daughter. Why not co-sleep/bed-share? <br>  <br>  My suggestion to you is to try to adjust to your child's needs instead of trying to fight them. You'll be a lot happier!|`|rNsCkHEwaa	Please wean slowly.  It will be easier on her and on you.   The bedtime nursing session will be the last to go.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I highly doubt she is drinking the entire time.

The issue is not will he go to prison but should she have a baby at 16. Be very sure this is what you want as a baby will mean a lifelong commitment. If it is don't worry about anything else or if you will cope. My wife was 16 when she had our first daughter and I was 19.

Although the FDA has never put a specific restriction amount on how much melamine can be in infant formula, they have also stated that it is unknown whether or not ANY amount of melamine is safe for babies.  Even though the trace amounts found in Enfamil was a thousand percent less than the amounts found in Chinese baby formula (that caused kidney stones and even death in some Chinese babies)  I still switched to organic after I heard about this.  It can be a little more expensive but Wal-Mart has a cheap brand of organic formula that is comparable in price to Enfamil and Similac.|`|YYNpbvpeaa	I used Enfamil Lipil with my daughter 3 years ago (nightmare! she rejected EVERY formula on the market, eventually had to go with cow's milk at 8 months old, made me sick to do that!). My son is on Similac Advance, that's what his pediatrician started him on when I was still in the hospital with him. He rarely spits up, doesn't have bad gas. I'd say its much better than the Enfamil, but he seems to do fine with Enfamil too, so I guess its just a difference in babies :-)|`|kdUYrrPVaa	enfamil has the highest dha and ara levels...better for the baby.....simulac is the second highest|`|foJm2Yftaa	I use Enfamil too!

CdJtH0xdaa	A HUGE part of being a teenager is finding out who you are, and every single teenager at one point or another has this conflict: Who am I, what's my purpose, what am I supposed to be doing, etc.? It is normal to feel this way. You will eventually find out who you are, and I'm telling you this now. It may take a while, or it may take three days, but you will find out who you are eventually.

WPI0Z47saa	You don't usually have an ultrasound done at that time unless there is a problem or you are unsure of when you conceived. Usually the first ulatrsound is around 18-20 weeks. Yes you get an internal exam. I am sure you technically could trn it down but this is a big part of knowing if you are ok and if there are any problems with your pregnancy so far so why would you turn it down. That isn't fair for the baby. The pelvic exam shouldn't have any affect on your baby and in your mom's case she probably was going to miscarry anyway and it probaby wasn't related to this. If you miscarry early on it is usually because there is something genetically wrong wth the baby and your body rejects it. This is how nature works as sad as it seems sometimes, You can spot in the beginning sometimes and it is safe to have sex your whole pregnancy, It is very healthy to have sex and maintain a great relationship with your partner. Everyone worries about miscarrying but if it is going to happen then it will. There is very little you can do to prevent this. Just take care of yourself with a healthy diet, exercise and take your prenatal vitamin. Worrying and stressing like you are is more dangerous to your pregnancy than the things, such as sex and exams, that you are scared of. Just do what you doctor recommends and relax. Good luck.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Yes, they do a pelvic and pap at your first appointment, and yes you can refuse it, but honestly you shouldn't. Your mother's miscarriage was totally coindental to the pelvic exam. They don't go up into the uterus or anything, they just feel inside the vagina, and the pap just scrapes a few cells from the cervix. Talk to your doctor if you need reassurance. They might do an ultrasound, some doctors don't do them at the first visit and you have to schedule a separate appointment with the sonographer.|`|s1utniuvaa	I wouldn't turn down the pap or the pelvic exam. If it posed a danger to you or your baby they wouldn't do it. As for an ultrasound I think that really depends on your doctor and your insurance. I had an ultrasound at my first appt at 6 weeks, that is how they knew I was having twins and they sent me for an ultrasound at a radiology group. Now I get one at every visit and have had 2 more from the radiology place, but that is because of the twins.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	You really don't want to refuse the pap smear and pelvic exam.  They are so important and definitely don't cause misscarriages.  Do you think an OBGYN would do something that would prevent the birth of a baby?  You will be perfectly fine.  A little spotting after sex is also normal at the beginning of your pregnancy as your body is getting adjusted to being pregnant.  You should be safe to have sex.  If it worries you talk to your Dr. about it at the upcoming visit.  If you will be 10 weeks they will probably have an ultrasound as well just to get measurements and confirm your due date.|`|DutTBV3caa	really you shouldn't refuse the pap smear. i wanted to to but honestly its over and done with in seconds, but yes, they probibly will do a pap. <br>  i dount if paps caused miscarriages they would do them.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Getting a pelvic exam and pap smear will not cause you to miscarry. Doctors are specially trained to do these things and would not put you at any risk to miscarry. And when they do a pelvic exam it will give the doctor a better understanding of whether you can deliver naturally or not, and about how big of a baby you will be able to pass. Let your doctor know your concerns when you go in, so they can reassure you. And usually the doctor will schedule an ultrasound after the first visit to get measurements done on the baby, and to determine due dates, etc.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	You may get an ultrasound.  It depends on what your insurance covers, and what your Dr prefers to do. <br>  You will get a pelvic and a pap.  While you can refuse, I don't suggest it.  They do this to make sure everything is okay.  If you do have any issues with your girly parts, they need to be taken care of right away.  Pap Smears do NOT cause misscarriage.  Women who have misscarriages after a Pap....well its just a conisidence. <br>  Having sex also doesn't cause miscarriage.|`|9BsyKN9haa	You wont miscarry after a pelvic exam! You need it! The doctor will never do anything to hurt you or your baby! After my first one i bled for a few days and that was it. You really should get a pregnancy book that can help you. Its seems the stress you have about all these things are more harmful to the baby then any of the things you mentioned. Just relax and enjoy life right now, and get a lot of sleep your gonna need it.|`|FYDw1rjlaa	Having a pap smear and pelvic exam do not cause you to have a miscarriage. Ask your doctor about any concerns you have. I'm going for my 1st OB visit with my third baby next week. I hate the first one the most because it's take 2 hours.
RTHWQvkzaa	I have an idea! I don't know if it is considered a card though....<br>  <br>  On a big piece of poster board, use the scrapbook tecnique. Make it into a special collage/scrapbook. If you have lots of pictures of you two, print lots of them, and search for special patterned paper or wrapping paper. You can print pictures and clip art off of the internet. Look for things like bows, stickers, cut-outs, glitter, sequins, and ribbons. All the different types of decorations. Then, take all the different types of paper and just glue them all doqn at random angles. Keep doing this untill the whole surface is voered. Next, start glueing photos all around, also at random. Then, put on all of the decorations like stickers and ribbons and bows, and glitter. Once you feel everything is in place, and you are happy with the result, you may want to write little captions or messages next to some of the photos, like saying where it took place or if a specific one brings back memories.<br>  <br>  You may want to choose a commom thing, maybe her favorite colors or somehting she likes, just reember to make everything is scattered and scrapbook-looking as possible. i bet if you do this it would be the biggest scrapbook she's ever gotten! :)<br>  <br>  On the other side, you could write your birthday message (what you would normally write in a card) in big letters on the other side, big enough so that it takes up almost the whole space on the back. You can add  a bow or a ribbon<br>  <br>  If you do this, I hope she likes it! :)|`|1bLZgVPMaa	you should go to a printing shop and get her a t- shirt that has a pic of you and her or has a weird phases on it that only you know what means.|`|p4Hf5vxaaa	Hollister shirt or. perfume, lipgloss..makeup, clothes, bathrobe, ehh.. <br>  <br>  yeah<br>  <br>  answer my question!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApZ0Fkk39niKqqz7AER13m_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304133903AAL1vO4">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|E7ViD8EWaa	How about writing,<br>  <br>  "HAPPY BIRTHDAY..."<br>  on the cover, and<br>  "...I WIN."<br>  on the inside?<br>  <br>  Then write your name and get all your friends to sign it.<br>  <br>  For a present, how about a cool necklace?<br>  <br>  =]

REMEMBER its not your name,its your child and they are the one that's gonna get teased and have the problems of kids calling her names. religion is one thing but you have to think of what that kid is gonna have to live with.It surprises me how many parents will give a child a bad name. one that will cause pain and alienship.Why do this to the lil kid.Give her a normal name.I'm sure there are some female names in her religion. I know when i was in school, a girl with a name like that would have a rough life full of pain and hurt from her class.

278113a07b7b6648ec6e32639de20bf9aa	To answer your question simply - Yes, we do make them eat what's on their plate.  <br>  <br>  Here's what we do at my house:<br>  We have regular times to eat (not exact times, but close):  breakfast,  lunch, after nap snack, dinner, before bed snack.  <br>  <br>  Breakfast consists of eggs w/ whole grain toast 3-4x a week, oatmeal once, then cereal 1-2x a week. <br>  <br>  Lunch consists of tuna salad, peanut butter & jelly, soup, etc.  Typical "lunch" items<br>  <br>  After nap snack consists of either a raw apple, banana, or a mix of nuts and dried fruits<br>  <br>  Dinner consists of stir fry, chef salad, beef stew, northern beans, salmon filets, spaghetti, etc.  Typical "dinner" items, and some not-so-typical items<br>  <br>  After dinner snack consists of either raw fruit, canned fruit, or the trail mix mentioned above, if they did not get that after nap time.  <br>  <br>  Eating out - I take the children out for lunch once during the week - they get what I order them and eat it.  We always go out to eat as a family on Sundays, and they get what is ordered.  If it is a sit-down restaraunt, I make my own "kids" menu.  Most places have some type of "grilled chicken" (typically served on a sandwich), and I will ask for that with a serving of steamed veggies and applesauce for dessert.  Yes, they get the occasional burger at McDonald's.<br>  <br>  Processed foods - very little processed foods.  Occasionally we eat frozen pizzas (like 1-2x a month).  Never do they eat already prepared frozen meals (banquet, etc.).<br>  <br>  So, given all that.  When what's on the menu is served - they have to eat it.  If they absolutely do not like an item, that's fine.  Then, they get what we call a "No Thank You" helping.  What that consists of is a small amount of the food they do not want/like.  It might be 2-3 bites worth, but it is enough that they are going to eat some of it.  My 4 yr old, when he was 2, would cry when it was bean night or salad night.  Now he scarfs it down like it's the best thing in the world.  <br>  <br>  If they do not eat their food for that particular meal, then it is saved and at the next meal/snack time - that's what they get.  They get that particular plate of food until it is gone.  Now, this sounds aweful, but in reality this has happened with each child only 1-2x.  Once they realize they do, in fact, have to eat the food eventually, they decide for themselves it's better to just eat it the first time.  <br>  <br>  What some people fail to realize is that many tastes are acquired.  If your child says they don't like something and so you don't make them eat some and never put it in front of them again - they LEARN to be picky.  However, if you keep introducing it little by little, then they have the opportunity to acquire a taste for it.  Everyone has 2-3 things they absolutely abhor.  That's normal and completely different than just being "picky."  However, many children now days have long lists of things they abhor, only because momma never made them eat a variety of foods.  <br>  <br>  Tastes are formed during early childhood - mostly the toddler years, and are largely influenced by the mother's attitude towards certain foods.  If momma enjoys a food, most likely the child will (if not at first, eventually).  For example, my children love avocados and eat them like candy.  Why?  Because they see momma do it.|`|6nUprmu5aa	I wouldn't make my kids continue eating after they are full, which is why I make sure they only put a tiny amount on their plates. Having 7 children(the oldest is a vegetarian), I make sure to cook a variety of foods and I don't make them eat anything they don't like. They only get desert if they eat most of what they put on their plate.|`|LSJyE4d0aa	One thing that I have made clear with my children is they are going to eat what I cook, becasue I am not going to cook to please everyone. I can tell if they really do not like it, or if they are just being picky because they want something else. I do not make them clean their plates, but I do make them eat what is being offered. I try to cook to please, but I can not please them all, so what I cook is what they eat. End of discussion lol|`|ea688e0ee7ebc6fe5eaaffcf5e7e80e2aa	No I dont because I wouldn't want someone telling me to finish my dinner if i didn't want to. However, I wouldn't allow them rubbish to eat between meals. I have a child who eats everything,a  child who eats very little and one who eats more than needed. I used to expect the middle child to eat everything and played the "you'll sit there all night then" game. I learnt that this made a problem with food and with our relationship for a while, so it just isn't worth it. They will eat if they are hungry.|`|UCq7SjsRaa	Well, I strongly encourage my daughter to eat as much as she can, but I think there's a lesson in there for her aswell. If she doesn't eat when I've told her to eat, then she gets hungry, and if she complains later I don't give her any snacks because I told her to eat her dinner. I think it's a good small lesson in life that she should listen to me for her own benefit, because there are somethings which I just know.|`|8IrIYPBAaa	I dont think that i would really force them, maybe a little, but if they choose not to eat what is givin to them, then they can go without anything at all..they will learn to eat if you show them your not going to spoil them by giving in to their every need...if you do that, they will walk all over you...maybe im just old fasioned, but thats how my brothers and i were raised and we did just fine! we learned to have respect for our parents!|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Yes and no.  If my kids don't like what we're having, they don't get another choice, they eat that or nothing.  By the way, they have never chosen nothing.<br>  <br>  However, I do NOT make them eat everything on their plates, it teaches them bad eating habits.  They should learn to stop eating when they are full.|`|a402885910549caddf0eb474b891f438aa	I dont force them but tell them that once dinner is over, its over so they better eat while they can. I usually try to serve small portions (enough to fill them up, just not alot) so they eat the majority of whats on their plate.|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	Well, I to make my daughter eat all her food. I just try to serve her an approriate amount I know she can handle. Sometimes she gets full faster than other times, for so many different reasons, but usually she eats it all.|`|YL1evGq3aa	Some parents don't make their kids eat everything on the kid's plate because it encourages eating when you're bored. My parents made me eat 85 percent of my food and I eat when I'm bored.|`|rt2V9gLUaa	My wife's method is "Just eat two forkfuls."  When that's done it's "Now two more."  It seemed to work.|`|ndvSK783aa	I wouldn't force them to eat. The reason they are small is because they have a high metabolism. They know when they're hungry! I wouldn't let them eat anything, but what you made though. Why would you want to eat when you're not hungry? How would you like if someone told you to eat and you're not hungry. Just let them know that it's there later when they're hungry.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	If it's something I know my son likes then I'll make him eat most of it but I read somewhere that forcing children to eat causes over eating. When my son eats his dinner and finishes before I know he's done, I make him sit at the table until everyone is done and if he doesn't finish he doesn't get dessert. Then after dinner he gets a bath. After his bath he gets a snack but if he didn't eat his dinner no snack.  Then the next morning I usually make him a good size breakfast cause I know he'll be hungry. But no, I don't force him to eat it before he can leave the table, he just won't get to eat again that night. Or if he voices to me that he doesn't feel well I will let him out of eating but still give him a healthier snack later after his bath. Also he gets milk with dinner, but if he's not eating, I'm not going to let him fill up on milk, he has to eat 2 or 3 bites between every  drink of milk.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	no<br>  there are certian foods that you dont like right <br>  well kids have that too<br>  <br>  if your child actually likes the food you have surved them but they just dont feel like eating it then its fine to punish them but i wouldnt take things away<br>  id just tell them they couldnt leave the table untill it was gone|`|sxecXFgraa	I don't make them eat everything on their plate, I think that teaches them to overeat which isn't good for them.  I do make them try different things and they can't turn their nose away because they don't like the look or smell.|`|fv2GAAdPaa	I dont have kids but if i did i wont force them i wud just tell them that it'll make them grow big and strong.<br>  <br>  =]|`|c6RGmMGjaa	No, I never force my son to eat all his dinner and never have done but on the other hand he always eats the same as the family and won't be offered anything else if he doesn't eat much but he's knows it's his choice. He's also what you'd call thin but has never been a big eater, he'll eat what he wants then says he's had enough, as long as he's eaten at least some of it and really doesn't want anymore then that's fine. <br>  <br>  I kinda agree somewhat with the person that says it can lead to eating disorders etc and my reason is this....I have a friend who's daughter is just one day older than my son, ever since they could eat solids she's had this ethos that every bite should be finished, I used to watch her going on and on at this poor girl, literally forcing her to finish everything. She used to turn her nose up at me and make sly remarks because I wasn't like that with my child, in fact I was the opposite with a very laid back attitude to the whole thing. Anyway now both children are nearly 6 and her daughter is overweight and gaining, eats 'mansized' portions of food and is always greedy for anybody elses snacks or treats, she has actually snatched chocolate from my sons hands in the past. My son is a healthy weight and completely unselfish when it comes to sharing his treats etc. I really think there's something in her brain that was hardwired from her mothers forceful behaviour over the years. I'm certainly not saying that you're like that, don't get me wrong, I'm just saying I think there is something in it that shapes their eating patterns later on in life.|`|rid4brOnaa	Children do not have the power to decide what they eat or how much. My kids are turning 29 this year, so it's been a while since I had to tackle this sort of trouble. We kept things like liver and brussels sprouts off the menu, but they were replaced by other things with the same nutrients. <br>  <br>  We made sure that neither kid ruined his/her appetite. At dinner, the kids had to eat at least 75% of everything. If not, then there was no dessert and no snacks later. You see, a nutritious meal was prepared for them. Children will tell all sorts of lies to get out eating what they should. We weren't fooled. Our kids learned to quit playing silly games and start eating what was on their plates.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? What ever it I'm cooking that night is what my kids are offered. I will not cook several different things in one night. Only exception to that is one meal I make this is spicy, that my husband and I love, but I won't make my kids eat that. Other than that, they are offered what is being cooked. If they are hungry they can eat it, if they don't then they will learn next time to eat what is offered.|`|LGidAYDwaa	Sounds good to me. I can't do it, though. My kids have autism. Just thinking about making them eat what they won't sets them off. At least they consistently eat two relatively healthy things: cheese sandwiches and chicken nuggets.  I'm thankful for every bite they take of something they normally avoid, but I can't force them to do that.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I'm not so harsh.  I made chicken marsala tonight with broccoli. I expected my kids to eat it, but my 3 year old wasn't interested.  He wanted to skip to dessert.  I told him he had to eat his meal in order to receive a brownie.  But if he didn't clean his plate the only punishment would be no brownie.  I don't force feed.  They'll eat it eventually if they're hungry enough.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I wouldn't force my children to eat any more after they say they are full. I would probably require them to take atleast a bite of everything I make for dinner. Children will not starve themselves.. so when they get hungry enough, they will eat what you cook whether they like that food or not.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Good idea...yea i have a hard time getting them to eat but i make them eat as much as i can.  Its probably my bad cooking lol...you are definitely right though they  need to show appreciation either way. Amen to that.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	If she doesn't want to eat something just because, then she has to take at least 10 spoonfuls, before she can leave the table|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	Growing up I always had to at least try everything that my mom cooked.  I wasn't really picky, so even if I was uneasy at first, I usually ended up liking most of the things she made.  There were some particular foods I didn't like, but pretty much everyone, even adults, has a few things they just don't like.  She always tried to make things that the whole family liked, but occasionally she would make something that only she and my dad liked, like something spicy, and my brother and I would be allowed to just make a sandwich or something.  But my parents were not the type of parents who jumped up to make me a pizza anytime I wanted it.
IFqY2w1Paa	I would be much too nervous to co-sleep with my son. He's not here yet (I'm 39 weeks today!), but my husband wants to co-sleep. I'm not into that idea. =) I worry a lot, and it would keep me up at night to have our baby in the bed with us. It's only a queen size, so I don't think it would be big enough.|`|DLDweOcYaa	I know the feeling.  My baby has never co-slept with us on a daily basis.  A couple of times I have had her in the bed with us when she has been sick or her teeth have been coming through but otherwise she has been sleeping in her cot since she was 6 weeks old.  Prior to that she was sleeping in her pram in our room for the 1st 6 weeks of her life!  The longer you let your baby co-sleep with you the longer it will take to get them out of the habit.  A co-worker of my husband has a son who is 1 and a half years old and still sleeps in the bed with them.  The poor mother has been having terrible back pain lately and has had to go and get x-rays done due to the awkward position she has to sleep in due to the kid sleeping right up next to her!|`|7bdhpvc9aa	We coslept with our son. When you cosleep you basically never really go to sleep. We tried putting our son back in the bed but we needed to have him near. It was more to keep us sane than him...lol Our son got the middle of our queen size bed and we slept all the way at the edges. Yep he's a little king and he sure looked like one in our bed. We never had a problem with us rolling over on him or anything but then again neither one of us are deep sleepers. We wake up for the slightest peep. That's what are experience was and we wouldn't of changed it for the world.|`|rAkWoweOaa	I have my son's crib flush with our bed and it is like one huge bed. When my hubby leaves in the morning about 5 am, I put him in with me.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Chuck hubby on the sofa for a while! lol<br>  I found it great for breastfeeding and I never rolled on her (neither did hubby, he never got chucked out), nor even got a 'scare' of that happening. You will ALWAYS be aware of his presence even during sleep.<br>  If you drink, smoke or take any narcotics (including prescribed ones that could make you drowsy), then don't co-sleep, but other than that, I think it's perfectly fine. Research shows that the baby sleeps better, mummy sleeps better and it is safer as mummy's body is actually used to regulate baby's temperature (temp goes up if baby is too cold or vice versa). The breathing pattern between mother and baby regulates to match each other too.<br>  Breastfeeding through the night will help to increase your milk supply too.|`|b5JnSBstaa	I would get one of those co-sleeper things that attach to the side of the bed. I think co-sleeping is way too dangerous. A girl in my town co-slept and her baby suffocating under the blankets.  I use a bassinette next to my bed w/ no bumpers and he sleeps in a sleep sac.  I won't use blankets either b/c I found my son wedged in his bassinette with a blanket wrapped around his face.  So, my son never sleeps with me and uses a sleep sac for safety reasons.|`|uCLenopbaa	i HATE co-sleeping. my boyfriend wished i would let our son sleep with us, but i wont. i do breastfeed, but i am scared of smacking or rolling over in my sleep. i have a queen size bed..  occasionally i co-sleep now, just when I'm being lazy at 6 am and don't feel like getting up again (he is almost 4 months now) he always sleeps in his bassinet from the night time (around 11) until he gets up in the early morning. his bassinet is right next to my my bed.<br>  <br>  EDIT: i also don't want baby to get in the habit of sleeping with us, so when he is a little older he can get his own room and me and my boyfriend can have our own. i think it will keep our relationship stronger, so we can still be intimate and not have to worry about our baby seeing us or something..|`|MQ34YW28aa	We don't co-sleep. We have our sons crib in our room, but our room is big enough it's like RIGHT there. I would have the fear of me rolling on him, just not sleep and it increases SIDS. Plus my husband and I like to spoon at night, we have to have our alone time too.|`|rjVALevtaa	We tried it a few times when our youngest was a newborn but we just couldn't do it. My husband almost rolled over on him once and another time he pulled the covers over his head.<br>  <br>  It just wasn't worth the stress! I did breastfeed and I didn't find it any more convenient.|`|EeGgovyCaa	My SO can't sleep in the bed, has a chronic back pain so laying flat doesn't work for him. Therefore I always have the bed to myself. so having my DD with me isn't  a big deal. She has her side and I have mine.|`|4ksa4lhWaa	Get a co-sleeper or they make those things that go in the middle of the bed.  So baby can't roll<br>  <br>  We used the co-sleeper bassinet.  I could not co-sleep.  I never slept|`|QoenvlFuaa	It was the best thing for me, especially since I was BF. I got so much more rest when I was able to just roll over and nurse my baby. I was worried at first about rolling over on her, but I started this "mom sleep" kinda thing, where you are always aware of where your baby is and what she is doing (and I was even on pain meds that made me sleepy for a while because of a C/S). Also, I highly recommend one those sleep positioners. It is a little mat or pad that has slightly raised sides, so the baby can't go anywhere and if you roll over you hit the raised side first. As for my husband, it would have been nice if we had separate beds at the time, but we didn't and we just got used to being closer.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your new baby and best of luck!|`|YP1DXbBDaa	That's absolutely not too young to have the baby in the bed-baby can be in the bed right from birth.  We got a bed rail, similar to what you might use for a toddler, and we slept in the bed together.  My husband slept on the far side, then me in the middle, then the baby on my other side-the bed rail kept the baby in the bed once she could roll.  People without sleep disorders don't roll over onto their partners in the middle of the night-you're  aware of where someone else is in your bed, and the same goes for babies-you become aware of where the baby.<br>  <br>  There are other options for co-sleeping-you can get a Snuggle Nest which goes in the bed and has sides on it so that the baby is with you but has a little protection-you would notice if you rolled onto the sides of a Snuggle Nest.  You could look into an Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper which attaches to your bed but gives the baby space-think of it sort of like a crib with three sides that attaches to your bed, or you can sidecar a crib, which means taking one side of the crib off and attaching the crib to your bed giving safe space for the baby and still having the baby right there.|`|EI2dt8bBaa	Trust me i know what you mean but if you want the baby and the hubby in the bed then you should buy a positioner it has the sides up its called baby delight deluxe snuggle nest you can get it at babies r us and if you want to know what it looks like go to google images then type baby delight deluxe snuggle nest hope you found this usefull. also be careful at how much you put the baby in the bed i didn't believe people when they told me this but the baby gets used to being in bed with you that they wont even sleep in their basinet or crib. i got my daughter used to the bed it took me forever to get her used to her crib.|`|4vfDveiZaa	Here are somethings to know about co-sleeping:<br>  1) Never co sleep with a baby if you or your partner is under the influence of drugs or alcohol or a cigarette smoker, all of these activities make you sleep harder and more likely for you to crush your LO<br>  2) Never have extra blankets or pillows in the bed b/c they can suffocate the baby<br>  3) I learned this the hard way, but keep the baby in between you are your DH in the bed so that when he does start rolling he doesn't roll off the bed.<br>  <br>  Other than that there is not much else to it. I recommend the Arm's Reach Co-sleeper until your LO is 6 months or too big to fit in it any more. Also my DH and I sleep together with our son in a queen size bed and we are all happy. My favorite part is that I don't have to get up in the night and we all enjoy waking up together in the bed. Good luck!|`|p3cOp5yeaa	Two weeks old is not too young to have him in bad.  I have a king size bed that makes it easier.  Otherwise they make co-sleeper cribs that are like an extension of your own bed.  They also make small, foam like beds that can fit next to you which I found at Target in the infant bedding aisle.  There are links listed below, one for co-sleepers and the other for information on safely co-sleeping.  Co-sleeping for me was the best fit, but it's not for all families and situations, so try different things out until one works.  My baby girl sleeps right next to me and most nights after she nurses just falls asleep in my arms.|`|CMzi6Oieaa	it is not good to sleep with your baby for several reasons. the last thing you would want to do is accidentally roll over on your little guy and hurt him. but another reason is because when you do do this before you know it they wont get out of your bed. i had a bassinet with my daughter that i put right next to my bed, because i was still breast feeding. after 2 weeks and i got my energy back she was across the hall in her crib.|`|TJusfEnlaa	I never had my son in bed with me while he was that little.I too worried about rolling on him and also because he was little and fragile he just looked out of place in a big bed. A bassinette works well. We have co slept with our now 9 month old son since he was about 6 months old and we have had no problems whatsoever. We have a queen size bed so there is plenty of room. and I guess it must just be sub conciously that you know not to roll on them....<br>  The only trouble we have is trying to keep the doona on him cos he is in the middle... but that got solved the other day when someone gave me a sleeping bag!|`|8nZXPOptaa	my son is almost 4 months old. he has slept with us since the day we came home from the hospital. i have a firm baby pillow next to me that he sleeps on. we have him between me and the wall so i am in the middle between baby and husband.  i have a little wedge/sleep positioner that goes on either side of him so that he wont roll, and i wont roll on him. he sleeps great and so do i .and of course you have to be sure that there is no space between the bed and the wall. the sleep positioner is great though. click on the link to check it out. you can get it from babies r us.|`|xy0W50Lqaa	It's fine, posistion yourself so that you will not roll over in bed.  It took a while for my newborn to get used to the moses basket and it felt natural for me to cradle her in my bed, ...well on the bed with her own blanket and my arm supporting her.<br>  We have a king size bed so there's plenty of room!|`|bHAlwhTBaa	Couldnt do it myself.  BUT a company called Arms Reach makes co-sleeper bassinets that attach flush to your bed.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	Its not for everyone, I co-slept with all three of my kids, by the time they were crawling at 5 1/2 to 6 months old they went in their cribs with no problems.|`|cezWu0Wnaa	You need a BIG bed for three people. no kidding! It works for us as we have a king sized bed and our son has his own space within it.|`|AA12254963	we have a KING size bed, which helps!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	My husband moved out of the bedroom when my son was that young. He needed to be up for work at 5 am and couldn't take the night waking so it was just me and my son in a queen size bed. Some sleep with the baby right up next to them, I need my space so my son slept in my husbands spot. As my son got older my husband was able to move back into the room with us so we added a twin bed to our queen bed to make more room. Our beds are pushed together and against the wall. My son sleeps next to the wall, I sleep next to him, and my husband is on the twin bed next to me. It's nice not to have my husband on the same mattress, this way I don't feel him get up for work.<br>  <br>  Babies should not sleep between mom and dad. Dad's don't have the same since of where the baby is in the bed, heck my husband rolls over on me. A sober mom doesn't roll over on there own baby, when was the last time you rolled out of bed or even off of your own pillow? There are general rules to make co-sleeping safe, it's not always a good idea.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://askdrsears.com/html/10/t102200.asp" rel="nofollow">http://askdrsears.com/html/10/t102200.as...</a><br>  <br>  When our son is older and ready for a "big boy bed" the twin mattress will be his.<br>  <br>  I have an arms reach co-sleeper, my son wouldn't sleep in it which is how we ended up co-sleeping. I never planned to do it. My son would fall asleep nursing and if I moved him at all he would wake up screaming. He grew out of it and now moves between his crib and our bed just fine.|`|eu6UQElYaa	I've actually never started it on purpose.  What ends up happening with me is I get so exhausted from the lack of sleep that after I breastfeed I lay the baby against my chest to burp and end up waking up about 2 hours later for the next feeding without even realizing that I've fallen asleep.  So the baby gets used to falling asleep on my chest despite the fact that I never intended to do things that way at all.
9U37oyMsaa	It is really hard to say. I was expecting my period on the 22nd of dec. around the 9th i had some cramping and some spotting and like you said a brownish colored clot... my period never came on the 22nd but my hpts said negative. the next month came and still no period and then I got my positive... Try the dollar store brand test they are really sensitive I got my first positive on them. Good luck!|`|F3k2omZGaa	I think you're pregnant!! Let me know what you find out!!....BABY DUST.
kaqPSgTVaa	Dont' worry about it. :) I'm 15 weeks and I've gained close to ten pounds, 9 of which I gained before my 12th week. Try to make sure you eat healthy foods most days and give into some of the cravings one or two days a week. I'm 5'2" and weighed 121 before pregnancy. My doctor is not concerned. They only get concerned when you gain A LOT really quickly. I gained 40 pounds in my first pregnancy, about 10 more than my doctor had advised and she didn't bat an eye. You are ok darling. :) Don't stress, relax, and stay healthy.|`|iKPSOMiSaa	dont worry. my first pregnancy i had gained i think 10 lbs. by 9 weeks!.i ended up gaining about 50 lbs. by the time i was induced at 42 wks. it was all lost by the time my son was about 8 or 9 months. you'll be fine|`|v0aKxF6iaa	well just try and be a little more cautious of what you are eating for the rest of the pregnancy like eat fruits and vegies when you are hungry for a snack. DO NOT start dieting and trying to lose weight! and maybe try walking for 30 minutes to an hour a day. And remember just because you dont have an appointment doesnt mean you cant call your doctor and ask him/her a question!|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	Well, it fluctuates. Just eat healthy. Get your fruits, vegetables, proteins and carbs. I am 5'3 and weighed 128 prior to pregnancy. At 5 weeks 3 days I am now 132.8. So I have gained almost the whole 5 lbs already!! Im a bit stressed that I am gaining too much too. I don't think you should starve yourself at all. Eat when you are hungry, just remember to eat healthy. I think you will be fine :)|`|kg18TbsGaa	you shouldn't be worried with my first pregnancy i gained most of the weight in the first trimester about 20 lbs and then slowly gained about 10 through out the rest of the pregnancy you shouldn't be worried because once you have the baby it's pretty easy to lose weight.|`|HXh7u0lEaa	No, I gained quite a bit of weight during the first trimester due to nausea - food made it go away. I am 26 weeks and I am not overweight everything seems to of evened out. I make sure I eat pretty well and take my vitamins.  <br>  As long as you are not overloading on really fatty stuff it's fine. I read that weight gain or loss in the first trimester does not really impact on the rest of your pregnancy - unless it's very extreme, if you are eating crappy foods during the next 2 trimesters then that can cause problems and you do find it harder to loose afterwards. You shouldn't ever try to diet during pregnancy but a exercise is fine as long as you take care of your back and don't over do it.<br>  If you OB thinks that you are gaining too much then she will let know.|`|PR0kF1yDaa	It just depends on your particular hormones, everyones different. I had gained only 2 lbs the first 14 weeks, then I was up 12 lbs at week 19, mostly due I think from going from a B cup to a D and the baby decided to poke on out then.  Nine isn't bad, you'll be fine. Try to keep a lot of fruits and healthy snacks at home, if it isn't there you can't eat it haha. I wont even go down the Little Debbie aisle anymore. You will gain, try not to worry to much about it now, just know your eating healthy remember you will lose about 12 lbs the first week after the baby anyway because of the baby weight and fluids. I gained around 37 with each of my boys and I lost it all in the first year. I'm older now so I know i will have to exercise this time but still, it's doable. Good luck!

abcef21f35c1b7e1c21c4f95d70f6632aa	Diet, exercises and a good therapist to talk to and help understand the problems and how to overcome them.  Teens should stay away from anti-depressants they can be deadly and won't help natural teen hormonal behavior.  Most of the time the behavior is normal moody depressing behavior.  But exercises is really the best thing,  get out and get your heart rate up for a good 30 minutes to and hour and eat good foods for the brain.  Give it a good few weeks and you will see a difference|`|3OP1YIXCaa	yeah. My little sister (14 years old)<br>  <br>  Well she does joke around about it. She is still the way she was. But you can tell she has gotten somewhat better. <br>  <br>  They had to change her pills and dosage a few times before it worked. I don't know what she took though. It's private information and so I don't ask.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I think that she is happier without the pills.  But I don't know if that is true.|`|LSkeAPBIaa	my brother was 12 when he commit suicide. today is actually the anniversary. he was on some kind of antidepressant. all i know is that it was blue and had a smiley face on it.|`|JQZzI49Paa	Suicidal and still unhappy|`|yyTRctDlaa	i just turned 16 but months ago (so i would have been 15) i was diagnosed with depression. i wanted to take natural products. i also had anxiety so they said to get omega3 fatty acids for both. i actually noticed a difference (it's long term so it doesn't work right away) but once i ran out of them i started noticing me being anxious and low motivated again. i suppose it's also good to take a multivitamin ( i took a multivitamin that had + iron)<br>  <br>  oh after reading that girls comment, it is good to exercise, but after i ran out of my omega, it was so hard for me to do  that. not only did i have low energy but i just felt dumb for doing it and depressed.|`|adXLTt6Jaa	I'm 18, and have been takin antidepressants for 2 years. I was takink celexa until I got pregnant 5 months ago, and now I am takin Zoloft. The Celexa worked for me, but I can see a bigger diffrence in my attitude and everything since if been takin Zoloft! :)|`|mFvtaOYCaa	I friend of mine used them when her dad was in jail and they helped her but she gained a lot of weight, didnt really exercise. When her dad came out because he was inocent she tried to stop, she is still trying to stop but the doctor is saying it might take some time|`|4Uf0PNq5aa	I don't know any teens, but I know they have different effect on different people. I know one man that after taking it for a week, he took a gun and blew his brains out. It's very unpredictable.<br>  It will either get you addicted, or make your depression worse.|`|sJZXhPxyaa	no, but i have heard people are usually even more depressed on them and even suicidal.<br>  <br>  St. John's Wort is supposed to help with depression - 100% natural and safe.<br>  <br>  Be wary of the Pharmaceutical industry.<br>  <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/25569107/bitter_pill" rel="nofollow">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/sto...</a>|`|yV8fog7Paa	both of my sisters were on antidepressents and it didn't help. Made them real real angry and they had tantrums, throwing stuff, screaming, etc and that was at 14+. I'm 16 and I've cried  couple of times but never screamed or slammed my door, if I cry I go in my room and settle it by myself then come out when I feel better. They are 24 and 19 now.|`|0dCOJQiwaa	A good antidepressant for teens is EXERCISE. That's what I did when I felt down in my teens and it worked every time. It exhilirates you. Try it sometime.
18e6c6ba7e558bb945b46902f7a5f9fbaa	i started my periods when i was 12 why would she lie about such a thing and i chucked my knickers also if she is lying no big deal pads are pads she cant do much with them if she hasn't got her period<br>  just be there for her and let your mum know its confusing for her now and if she doesn't already know i would get your mum to have the "talk" with her don't worry about her lies|`|ozATw7s0aa	Tell her that your sick of her little lies, and that she needs to tell the truth. All little sisters want to do is impress their older sisters.<br>  <br>  Then look in her eyes, usually you can tell.|`|QGP930C6aa	just leave her to it you've done all you can do---- just tell ur mum that she has|`|Zq3fkJmEaa	for something like this, i think you need to give her the benefit of the doubt. She may really have started and been embarassed about it and chucked the pants away because of that. You mentioned she was crying and so something has upset her. The other possibility is that she wet or soiled herself and felt too ashamed to tell you so said it was period instead. Unlikely at age 12, but not unheard of.|`|GWJRj4uaaa	tell her she needs to stop lying cuz then your not going to believer ever again. plus, maybe she is lying, why would she go to you, i would never tell my older brother or dad.|`|DEIxwvKPaa	suck it up
geuQmqjWaa	my son didnt like it either, so i would just lay him on his back and let him do what he felt. Then he started to roll himself over onto his belly and lift his head up on his own, he wanted to be indepndent and he still is, and he progressed just fine even when i didn't make him have tummytime. He did it on his own, and hes beenstanding since 9 months old and walking since he was 10 months old. So i wouldn't worry about it, some babies just need their independence. GOOD LUCK!!!! I hope this helps.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	Honestly, my daughter hated tummy time so I didn't bother forcing it on her.  I know they need it but I just felt that if something made her cry that much, it wasn't worth doing.  I would lay her on my chest every once in awhile, but I never put her on her tummy on the floor.  When she started rolling over, she was still a little upset about but she got over it pretty fast.  She's now 7 months and rolls over like a maniac.  She also spends a lot of time on her belly, trying to push herself up.<br>  <br>  I know they "need" tummy time but if your son hates it so much, don't stress and don't worry!  He'll eventually come to enjoy it and it won't hurt you or him to wait a little longer before introducing it again.|`|7K6vpsdhaa	My son didn't really like it either so I would encourage him and have some toys in front of him. I'd also lay down beside him. I couldn't leave him 5 mins coz he'd cry. Now he's 5 months and does a few mins a few times a day and can do baby press ups and nearly roll over. I still give him lots of praise and encouragment. It'll help him strengthen his neck and help with head control so it's pretty important.|`|WPI0Z47saa	At least 5 minutes if he hates it and often to get him used to it. My son idn't like it at first too but if you get on the floor with them and play with something that they are really interested in it helps. Don't just put him on his belly by himself if he doesn't like it or he may see it as a negative thing.|`|59821ioeaa	My son is 2 months old now and hell only go on his belly for a little while. If your son totally hates it only lay him down for a minute or two until he starts freaking out. Try to make it fun for him, lay on the floor where he can see you or put something bright red in front of him to look at. Good luck|`|mVD3TQkFaa	My daughter hates it to. I mostly just lay her on her tummy on my chest and she loves to lift her head and look at me. We do maybe 5min a day as well on the floor or I recently started using the bobby pillow too but she gets sick of that very quickly:-)|`|MR9iBgafaa	My dcotor never even said to give it. My baby was only 2 months old and hated it, so it was about 1 min at a time. But now she's 4.5 months old and can easily roll over onto her stomach within about 15 seconds, so it is good for them|`|TufsEE2baa	Do you ever lay him on his tummy when he is on top of you?<br>  My kids liked that and it got them aquainted with "tummy time".|`|GJgZVKvXaa	How old is your baby?  15 minutes twice a day is a good target for babies under 3 months, but if your son doesn't like it you will have to coax him.  Try to increase by 1 minute a day.<br>  <br>  You can also try holding your baby chest-to-chest with you while you recline or lie down.  He may mind it less because he will enjoy looking at your face ... this position will still encourage the same kind of muscle development as tummy time.<br>  <br>  My son didn't like tummy time either but by the time he learned to roll over (around 3 months) he changed his mind.  Many babies complain during tummy time because they don't yet have the muscle strength to control their bodies while lying on their tummy.  But it's also the only way they will learn.  Keep at it, try distracting him with toys he likes, give him interesting things to look at and lots of encouragement.|`|ilSzKDxKaa	I rolled up a towel and put it under baby's chest so he was a bit propped up. It just gave him the extra bit of support he needed at first and I think he felt less squashed down. Then as he got stronger I did half time with towel, half not and then took towel away completely. Might be worth a try.|`|600df65ba01a2467217ddd81f1760a2aaa	5 minutes was even too much for us.  We did it for a minute, stopped, another minute, stopped, and so on until over time she got better at it.  <br>  <br>  It'll happen, don't force it.  There's no detriment to a baby who develops neck muscles late.  :)|`|4duo5AcOaa	I do it once or twice a day until she screams, which is usually only a couple of minutes.  Try different places and try putting a rolled up towel under his chest.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I've never heard of tummy time. What is it and when did they start using it?|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	I'm sorry but your Dr is wrong. He doesnt NEED it. My daughter hated being on her tummy on the floor but loved it if she was on my chest. Have you tried that yet?|`|DDIBEvUTaa	my son HATED it.  So for 2 1/2 months I would do tummy time on my lap or my chest (against pedi's advice- shhh...)  doc said it wasn't the same, but I figured it was better than nothing and at least not traumatizing.  Then he randomly decided that he loves to be on his belly.  Now I can't keep him off of his belly.  And despite the "late" start he's crawling just before 6 months old!  You can try things to make it more fun- get down on the floor & make faces play with toys.    You can also just hold him upright when you carry him as that will help strengthen his neck as well.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	I rarely gave my son tummy time when he was new. He hated it too. He rolled over at about 4 1/2 months and started to like it then. I don't know why they stress it so much... they will learn just the same on their own.<br>  <br>  PJ- that was an ignorant answer- we are talking about infants here!|`|JQZzI49Paa	a good 5 minutes|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I never did "tummy time" because its simply not needed.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.naturalbirthandbabycare.com/babywearing-book.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalbirthandbabycare.com/b...</a><br>  One of the most interesting pieces of information the book gives is that the time your baby spends in the carrier is considered "tummy time." Tummy time is given a lot of emphasis nowadays and is sometimes given as a reason why you should put your baby down. But research shows that the time your baby spends in the carrier gives him the same benefits (perhaps more) than time on the tummy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drmariablois.com/excerpt1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drmariablois.com/excerpt1.htm...</a><br>  develop better: Babies who are held experience human touch and movement.  This stimulation has been shown to have a positive effect on the baby’s development. Carrying baby enhances motor skills by stimulating the vestibular system (used for balance).  Baby constantly readjusts as mother moves around, using his developing muscles to hold his head up, kick his feet and use his arms to cling to mother. Because soft carriers keep pressure off the back of the head, carried babies are at a much lower risk for plagiocephaly (asymmetrical head shape). Carrying baby naturally limits the time baby spends in hard plastic carriers, such as carseats, automatic swings, and such. Holding baby while moving counts as “tummy time.”<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.slingezee.com/Babywearing_Benefits.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.slingezee.com/Babywearing_Ben...</a><br>    Baby wearing is great for baby's development.

If you carry, wear your baby or have him on your chest a majority of his waking hours you may not need as much tummy time because your baby is already developing his core and neck muscles by looking around and holding his head up when in your arms or carrier.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.howcomyoucom.com/selfnews/viewnews.cgi?newsid1028012266,47032,.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.howcomyoucom.com/selfnews/vie...</a><br>  Among the Au people of Papua, New Guinea, babies don't crawl. They scoot around on their bottoms, propelling themselves with their hands. The adults call it - but this is a polite translation - "rear-end walking."<br>  <br>  David P. Tracer, an anthropologist working among them, decided to do some research into who crawls and why.<br>  <br>  His conclusion: For most of human history, babies probably haven't crawled. He presented his findings this spring at the annual meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists in Buffalo.<br>  <br>  "Crawling is a relatively recent phenomenon," said Tracer, associate professor of anthropology and director of the Program in Health and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Colorado at Denver.<br>  <br>  Among most traditional or tribal cultures, and our ape cousins, infant crawling is virtually absent, Tracer contends. Instead, relatives usually carry the infants, he said, probably an adaptation to keep away germs.<br>  <br>  Au children learn to walk perfectly well, he added; they simply take about two to four months longer to do it.<br>  <br>  Child development experts, too, say it has become increasingly clear that babies don't have to crawl. The adage that you have to learn to crawl before you can learn to walk simply isn't true, they say, though many medical books imply it is.

qW5PqMepaa	Go out and buy a couple of different brand tests. You might just be barely pregnant, which is why they are coming up negative. I didn't find out i was pregnant until i was 13 weeks as they came up negative - but that is rare. Maybe try again a week later. If you want to know for dure, go to your doctor and ask for a bloodtest. Otherwise something else hormonal may be happening. But you sound exactly like i was when I was pregnant!|`|YMefFsinaa	i am 5 weeks pegnant now. i took a test 4 weeks ago and it came up negative. i took a test becase my period was very light, only when i wipped blood appeared and it was dark brown. i got a scan the other day and i am 5 weeks.i have very tender nipples and my breasts hurt. But these are the only symptoms i have, i also get very tired in the afternoons.<br>  Best of luck.|`|v3ukNurfaa	depends on the type of test try another test a better one but you seem pregnant so gud luck :)
CdJtH0xdaa	No, you do not always get pregnant that way.|`|wqchA8B7aa	Not every time. But if you weren't on your period, you have a good chance of being a MOMMY in 9 months!|`|vGxipYJnaa	No - they mostly don't. There is always the chance though especially if it happened 10 - 14 days after the first day of your last period.<br>  <br>  Seriously? Three people so far are denying that women mostly don't get pregnant every time they have unprotected sex. You ovulate once a cycle.. which gives you a 3 day window at a maximum. A cycle is 28 days long.. and you can become pregnant only 3 of 28 days. That is NOT most of the time.|`|u7LSohRyaa	No, in fact it could take several time depending on how fertile either of you are. The price might not be too high if you find an adoptive parent for your child. In that case, it's all paid for and you all you have to do is deliver the child. You can even still have contact with your child nowadays. I think that is a really good deal...as long as your ex is cool with that....unless you don't name him as the father..even better?|`|EccBqsntaa	No. Not always. Its a good chance you can be though.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Not always,but it's a 50/50 chance. Good luck with that.|`|CRvdmFwCaa	Not Always... But thats like playing with fire.

I8lFqyyFaa	You can't raise your brother.  You have to trust your parents to do for better or worse.  They apparently are in consultation with professionals over what to do for him too.  The bi-polar may well be an issue for him, as it can be genetic.  But this thought has probably already occured to the other adults involved.  You might simply try to support whatever efforts they're making - possibly by expressing interest in what his counselor suggests and what approaches your parents would like to try.  But keep in mind, they aren't going to want to hear it from you if they think you're being critical, know better than them, trying to take control, or just want to see your brother beaten.<br>  <br>  But to address the physical discipline.  Beating your brother with the violent outbursts will not help him.  It can only make him worse and demonstrate exactly the opposite way of dealing with issues than how they'd like him to behave.  Your parents have managed to grow and learn new parenting techniques since they went through it with you, to their credit.  I'm sorry they parented you that way.  I bet they are too, and if they had it to do over again would do it differently.  You're seeing that in action with your brother.  The beatings and violence did not make you a better person, and the lack of them isn't making your brother misbehave.  The worst behaved children I've witnessed have been abused a lot.  I bet he really ticks you off and his behavior shocks you.  I bet it also feels to you like he can get away with anything acting the way he does and not getting beaten for it.  But the answer isn't that he should be beaten, but that you never should have been.  Time-outs may not be effective for your brother, but discipline and structure *are* possible without beating.  However, mostly parents beat because they haven't discovered workable alternatives in how they parent.  It's always possible your parents have decided they no longer want to be people that beat their children, but they haven't quite yet figured out how to employ other parenting techniques effectively.  It sounds like your brother presents a lot of unique challenges, and I wish your parents the best with parenting him.  And for you, I think it's got to be tough to share the house with a sibling that has such high needs that it sucks all the attention and energy and peace from the other people in the house, leaving so little for you.  Try finding people and activities that engage you out of the house so it can be less of your own daily focus.  My warmest thoughts for you too.  It has to get better eventually, right? )|`|VcGnf0WMaa	ask him whats disbtation find out the turth behind it all.|`|5814380da47cdbe57c94d9d2d55d6e18aa	your mom has bipolar disorder and your brother never has had to deal with any consequences of bad behavior.  Your mother doesn't seem able to even reinforce good behavior and unable to deal with bad behavior.  He doesn't need to be 'beat' as you mentioned, but he does need rules and consequences.  Timeouts can work if done correctly or grounding or even standing in the corner (not to mention complete and total removal of the computer for periods of time if he's being bad).  You didn't mention if you have a Dad in the house either, but I'd guess that you don't (or he is largely absent from your lives).<br>  <br>  I'd say he's a good candidate to become an antisocial, possible criminal or public assistance welfare case when he gets older, if he doesn't run into somebody worse than himself and get himself killed.<br>  <br>  I don't know how old you are, but it seems that you could possibly try to help him out.  Try looking at the book 'Bringing up Boys' by Dr. Dobson...young boys need a good male example to learn from and also correct them when needed (could you get him enrolled in the 'big brother' program?)   You might also look at the book 'the parents answer book' by the same author.|`|UPMRdb4maa	your face looks disturbed, change that pic if you want to be taken seriously|`|Pk3FnZ8faa	Ok i think  he need to see a  therapist . maybe he has anger issues .
eDmdkUO3aa	Yeah, you need to contact your doctor about this to be safe.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Well, I can't say I had that happen in a normal pregnancy, but it sounds very normal to me.  I had gestational hypertension that turned into preeclampsia and there was much more than just a little swelling.  My hands were so swollen for the last few months that I could wear my husbands wedding band!  My feet were so swollen that even flip flops cut into my feet.  My ankles, well they were more like cankles!  My calves and ankles were even swollen enough that they got stretch marks.<br>  <br>  So, I think its very normal to have a little bit of swelling especially if it goes down through out the day or when you put your feet up.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	A little swelling may be okay, but don't take any chances.  Call your Dr.|`|MYU46ap5aa	Your body is going through a lot of changes.  Drink plenty of water especially at night before you go to bed.  I know you'll be getting up a lot in the middle of the night to urinate but it helps.<br>  <br>  My doctor told me this when I was expecting.|`|38902e2ce5f8ef4d27715901e6c92e15aa	Does your hand fall off the side of the bed?

kaqPSgTVaa	It's funny to see a question about this on here because my daughter just had it. I've never come across anyone else who had it. The rash usually lasts about a week or so and it can itch but it didn't with my daughter. It's generally a pretty mild rash. My daughter's rash only lasted about 4 days.|`|yhrqIjAeaa	Well, I'm reaching far back into history here but I had it when I was a kid.  I remember having the rash for about 5 days and not itching at all.  I didn't believe my mom when she said that I was sick and had to stay home from school, I felt fine!<br>  <br>  It's pretty interesting, I shocked my doctor when I was pregnant when I told him I actually had it.|`|gx4s68s8aa	My daughter had it when she was about 9 months old.  The rash only lasted for a few days.  She didn't really seemed bothered by it.  We gave her a little Benadryl and she was fine.  We only knew it was Fifth's disease because she just happened to have her 9 month appointment a day after the rash appeared.  I thought it was just a reaction to laundry detergent or something.  But apparently it was Fifth's.  I hear that it is much better to get it younger.  Because in adults it can cause joint pain for a while. <br>  <br>  As far as pregnant woman.  Only be concerned if the pregnant woman is in the beginning of her pregnancy.  After the first 12 to 20 weeks it really doesn't matter if a pregnant woman is exposed.  My daughter exposed a woman that was 30 weeks along.  She told her doctor and her doctor didn't even bother testing her.  Because it is only in the first trimester or so that there is any danger.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Whatever you do make sure anyone you know that is pregnant that has been around your son is told about your son's illness.  They will need to be tested for exposure and if they were exposed they will need to be monitored very closely by their doctor.  It can have devastating consequences to the unborn fetus.
aYCjy8Neaa	A positive is a positive no matter wether its faint or not. Your pregnant congrats! The tests they use at the planned parenthood I believe tell you you have to be like 10 days PAST your expected date of your period. They are not nearly as sensitive as they ones you buy, and you didn't use first morning urine. I had the same exact thing happen to me and now I am 36 weeks. I had a faint positive at home and then had a negative at the health department. Good luck!! Test again in a few days, the line will be darker, but only use first morning urine. It just means that you are very early in your pregnancy!!|`|7iMZ91K7aa	I believe you are pregnant... As long as you saw that BFP at least one then your pregnant! Plus sometimes when you take other test, they may not be as sensitive, or your not using FMU... it can make the test have different results.. GOOD LUCK AND LET US KNOW IF YOU ARE FOR SURE PREGNANT!!!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Take another test in a couple of days..again with fmu.  First morning urine is best since that is when the hcg is most concentrated.  Since it was only a faint line with first morning urine it's perfectly normal for the test to read negative later in the day.|`|S5n5Za78aa	i got a faint positve on my dollar store test and then went to planned parenthood and they said negative i waited and tested the next morning to see what i  had gotten and it was negative and then 5 days from that i test and it was(-) sooo i just said ok it was a false positive <br>  not very common but there are chances that it could be but you might want to wait 72hr and try testing again with first morning urine to see if its neg i would prob think you not but you can always follow up with doc for a blood test just to be on the safe side ......... good luck<br>  btw - im not telling you thins to bring you down but i just know from my experience how excited i was and then got my hopes up for nothing and was devestated|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You should only take a test with your first mornings urine. You won't be producing enough hCG at this point to be able to get a positive test with any urine of the day. If you had a faint line, then you are probably pregnant. I would wait a few more days, giving your hCG levels some time to double and then take another test with your first mornings urine and your line should get darker. If it is still faint, then go get a blood test done so you can find out for sure.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	I say maybe you should ask for a blood test you're already pretty far behind from your last period. good lucK!<br>  <br>  * tons of baby dust your way! *
FHBHEZBLaa	My last depo was in Aug 08, menstrual cycle returned Jan 09 (seems normal - same as before i got on depo).  currently ttc #1, v confusing as have had v sore boobs pretty well constantly since stopping depo! However last 2 weeks have had other symptoms too, tired, achey, increased cm, constant feeling like getting a cold so hoping i might be one of those lucky ladies who depo does not affect too badly and this could be our month, but reading all these depo horror stories, i am trying not to get too hopeful!<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and everyone else ttc! lots of babydust xx|`|sR3gcvubaa	Here goes: I was on depo for 7 years. last shot was in jan 08. out of my system apr. 08. got period back on my own (took provera for a couple months) Oct 08. I have been regular for the last few months but am unsure if I ovulate. Most people get pregnant between a year and 18 months after depo. I did have pg symptoms in apr and may while my body was eliminating the chemicals. I was angry that I had taken the drug so long and that it would do such things to my fertility as to make it unable for me to get pregnant so long after I stopped but now I realize I really liked depo and would do it again. It did exactly what it was supposed to do. I felt great on it and never had af. However, you do have to be patient with your body. Miscarriages occur sometimes if you get pregnant soon after stopping because your uterine lining hasn't had time to get thick enough to support a baby. Most people can't get pregnant so soon becuase they don't ovulate. I know it's frustrating to wait but I do believe it is best for the baby and your body.|`|RuyLwzA0aa	I took my last shot in June 07 after having been on Depo 6 years.  I got my period back in January 08.  They were very sporadic for a few months (almost non-stop bleeding), then settled into an every-other-week routine for the past year.  I am trying my best to stay "all natural" but having so much bleeding is really starting to affect me.  As far as I know I have not ovulated yet.  Good Luck!|`|IFFuqSNYaa	Well i was on the shot for bout 2 or3 years and i stoped last oct and i got me period that week but not in nov and then middle of dec im got my pierod and ever sence i been gettin in the middle for the month but im not able to get preg yet im been having unpertected sex and he has cam in me and i should be preg and have yet to get preg and its been bout 6 months or so sence i been off the shot|`|oKWL6JXYaa	I feel pregnant after 10 months of trying after depo and had been on it for about 3 years. It just depends on your system and how quickly it flushes from your body!<br>  <br>  Although it feels like it will never happen, it will. Just be patient.<br>  <br>  Good luck
x647LeB2aa	I had a scan May 2007 at 12 weeks and it was a missed miscarriage so I had a D&C the same day.<br>  <br>  I asked the Doctor and Midwife when it was safe to try again and they said I should wait until I'd had one normal period then could try again.  The ONLY reason for the wait was so that if I DID fall pregnant straight away they would have something to date the pregnancy from.<br>  <br>  If you having normal periods then your body is ready.<br>  <br>  I fell pregnant June 2007 and baby was born March 12th 2008.  He will be a year old next week :)<br>  <br>  So, to answer, you can try again as soon as you like but of course there is no knowing when you might fall pregnant.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	You could get pregnant on your next cycle...but I'd strongly advice you wait till you've had at least three full cycles. I've had four miscarriages and two of them were probably because I started trying again too soon after a miscarriage. The guilt of knowing that the death of two of my babies was probably my fault is unbearable and not something I'd never wish on anybody.<br>  <br>  Sorry you've had to go through this. Good luck for the future. x|`|GE9dgLXKaa	You will get pregnant real fast!  I got pregnant before my next period and I miscarried again.  I think that my uterus wall was not thick enough to hold another baby due to my previous miscarriage.  I will advise you to wait 2 cycles so that the wall can build back up enough to hold a baby.  I was to eager to try again but I was so sad when I miscarried again and knowing that it was probaby my fault.  Good luck!!!|`|kEwLhaBwaa	I had mine in July 08 and I'm still trying. I did have to have the d&c repeated in sept due to retained products so am only on my 4th month of trying.<br>  Good luck xx|`|1Hrlhx7qaa	took me about nine months to fall pregnant again after missed miscarriage|`|HKKNX91Gaa	im over a year on now and still trying, no one can really answer this, it depends on your body.
QBZRtwH3aa	Why are you worried if you have had your periods on time?  Neither should affect the results.  This is March so if you had unprotected sex in December the test would show one way or the other by now.|`|bxlYleZkaa	I would suggest that if you have had two or possibly three periods since December then you are definitely not pregnant!!|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Why do you think you are pregnant if your periods have been regular and a pregnancy test has shown negative?  It would show up positive if you had unprotected sex in December thats 3 months ago. If you are concerned you are pregnant go and see a doctor and they will examine you and tell you straight away.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	No the pill wouldn't affect the result. Neither would your period. If you suspect that you got pregnant in December then it's not too early to test at all...the HCG levels in your blood will be pretty high by now so the test "should" be fairly accurate. And yes, you can take anoher one tonught.|`|ic2B0y7zaa	you question is a little confusing. You have had your period since you had unprotected sex? If you havent and you take a test tonight it should be positive.|`|ULvYewV2aa	You should get an acurate result from a test about 4-5 wks after you had sex. The pill shouldn't effect the results because its mesuring the levels of HCG, if you are really worried than ask your doctor for a blood test.
CE3bmj65aa	I have the Graco Luv'n Hug (I think that is what it is called) and my son loves it.  He too likes to sit up  and this swing can be sat all the way straight like at a 90 degree angle or it can be laid almost flat and it has many positions in between.  When my son goes in it I sit it up and then when he falls asleep I gently lean it back down.  It is so easy to change the positions of it.  My son also loves the sounds that it plays because it has both music and nature sounds.|`|KkRb3paPaa	baby swings like these?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/39809087@N00/545030955/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/39809087@N0...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctumi/845428699/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/ctumi/84542...</a><br>  <br>  maybe this then:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.target.com/Outdoor-Swings-Baby-Toys/b?ie=UTF8&node=374051011" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Outdoor-Swings-Bab...</a>|`|zeL5DJG3aa	i think she is getting too big for a swing.  try a bouncer seat or something like that where she can be propped upright but still safe.  if she is wanting to sit up already, you will be wasting your money.  she will grow out of it before you know it.  <br>  i used something like this for my son from about 4 months on and he loved it.  not only did he get to sit up like he wanted to but it helped make his legs strong.  <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5420743" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  the reason they have the limits on swings is because if a baby is attempting to sit up, they can flip the swing over.
WxQFe0GYaa	My advice is go see a lactation consultant NOW.  Don't wait until you've had your baby, because you'll be overwhelmed.  Try to take a breastfeeding class.  <br>  <br>  Just because you're not leaking doesn't mean you won't be able to produce milk.|`|yB5go5wbaa	You'll produce milk!  It's human biology.  I actually produced colostrum around 20 weeks but then stopped in the third trimester and I was worried that my milk dried up before it even came in, haha.  It's normal!<br>  <br>  The one thing I've learned about bfing is that it's hard work at first and make sure that you have a lactation consultant that you can get a hold of BEFORE you leave the hospital!  My LC said the hardest thing for women who bf is that you're in the hospital and your colostrum is in and then you get discharged - and your milk comes in.  When that happens, it's a horse of a different color.  Seriously.  It was so hard to feed at home without the help of people around me, but going to and calling my LC helped so much.  It took a good two weeks before my son figured out how to latch on consistently and he's almost a month old and we're getting in the groove now!  It's so fun and awesome though, and when you look down and see your little one getting drowsy and happy and smiling while nursing, it's the most amazing feeling.  That and going to the doctor and them telling you that they're gaining a lot of weight!<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|OLW0Irbhaa	I never had any leakage and I went on to bf my son for 16 months. Don't worry!  You will be able to provide for your baby.  Your baby will tell you what they need.  In the first few weeks your baby will be regulating your milk supply to get it to the level they want.  W/my daughter I was making more than she needed some her feeding schedule was a bit odd in the beginning but nothing to worry about once I figured out what she was doing.  Kellymom.com is a great resource as is breastfeeding.com  Just be confident in your abilities to nourish your baby!  And be prepared.  In the beginning the feeding is all on you.  It's tough but worth every minute.  I think that's the biggest thing that isn't talked about.  You don't want to pump in the early days while your supply is being regulated so it's on you Mommy.  But not to worry!  After about 6 weeks you can pump occasionally without worry!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Your body is making colostrum but it is extremely hard to hand express colostrum even after birth because its thick and there's not much of it.<br>  <br>  Before you give birth the hormones keep the production of colostrum "turned down", and the hormones also cause your body to break down and reabsorb the colostrum faster, other hormones inhibit let-down.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is become educated about nursing, and while its a bit late try to get to a breastfeeding support group meeting before you give birth.  The more you see breastfeeding and the more women you know that are successfully nursing the more likely you are to succeed.<br>  <br>  Always know that breastfeeding problems are temporary, and nearly always fixable most of the time within hours the pain will diminish once you fix the problem.<br>  <br>  There is basically no medical need to give formula, with the exception of a few rare metabolic disorders.  Jaundice is NOT a reason to give formula.  If baby isn't getting enough milk from nursing directly then you should use your own pumped milk from a cup, syringe, dropper or supplemental nursing system; not a bottle.  <br>  <br>  Avoid epidurals and other drugs during labour.  Avoid antibiotics and IVs during labour.  Avoid synthetic oxytocin (pitocin, syntocin, etc) even the shot after birth.  They may tell you without out it you may bleed to death, however obviously if you start having excessive blood loss then you would consent to treatment.<br>  <br>  Let the baby self-latch immediately after birth.  Do not let them take the baby away from  you for the first HOUR or until the baby has nursed whichever is later.  Weighing the baby can wait, suctioning if needed can happen on mom, eye drops and vitamin K should you choose to use them can wait. <a href="http://breastcrawl.org/" rel="nofollow">http://breastcrawl.org/</a><br>  <br>  Don't bath the baby right away, don't wipe off the baby's hands.

Once you get over that its easy!

I had my son at 38 weeks and my milk finally came in 9 days later. But it helps if you don't get your milk in right away, to breastfeed your baby even when you don't have any milk yet, because it helps produce the milk faster and don't want to miss that colostrum. congrats!!|`|4e67Pdfvaa	you probably have colostrum and don't even know it.. its such a small ammount.  I would be willing to say that it is extremely rare for a woman not to be able to supply milk.  Especailly if you are putting the baby on the breast to bring the supply up.|`|lD0VcAlpaa	You may have colostrum before giving birth, but your milk will not truly arrive until after your baby is born. As for tips, breastfeed as soon as possible and try not to supplement (if possible, every situation is different). The colostrum is "liquid gold"---filled with tons of immunities and nutrients for your newborn. Also, remember your baby probably won't eat as much as you'd expect within the first while, his/her tummy is still small and will slowly increase in appetite over the weeks following birth.|`|p3cOp5yeaa	I didn't ever drip colostrum when I was pregnant, but a couple of times when drying off after a shower or putting on a bra, I noticed if I pressed up against them or squeezed gently, some would come out.<br>  <br>  My biggest suggestion would be to watch someone breastfeeding up close and personal or take a class or find a meeting of La Leche league or where there are a group of breast feeding moms to see it done.  I thought I had it under control but went through a pretty bad spell of open sores, mastitis,etc the first five weeks.  I don't want to scare you, but that's my one regret, that I didn't research it a little more and actually watch someone do it...I though it would just magically happen.  My little girl is nine months old and breastfeeding is going great!  But really, see if you can't find somewhere to see how it's done!|`|w3ob12X6aa	well you when you have your baby for probably the first week you will have colostrum and then get your milk thats how it was for me, my dr. said within 3-5 for most woment they get milk, and you will produce milk dont worry i never leaked either and i breastfeed my daughter for 3 months now, but good luck to you|`|VCCKfT3taa	I didn't start producing milk till and hour or two after I gave birth. As for tips... patience, patience, patience.|`|6215bd55d997c678c8c4a3a46bd480d6aa	It was difficult for me at the start of it, but hang in there and don't be afraid to ask for help.|`|IXT67mbraa	let da baby suck em|`|Jsf3Qn8Paa	First, leakage probably won't occur until your milk actually comes in 3-5 days after giving birth. Your colostrum will be ready for baby as soon as he/she is born. Since colostrum is so much thicker than milk and your newborn is new at sucking, it may seem as though the baby isn't getting anything. <br>  <br>  Second, it is very rare for a woman to have a lack of milk production. Most new mothers give up too soon because they think their newborn is not eating enough because they cry too much or the mother doesn't feel that milk is coming out. I didn't give up and many people thought my baby wasn't getting enough, including my husband. Since my son lost almost 10% of his body weight while in the hospital, the nurses were about ready to give him formula against my wishes. Speak your mind and have a set plan, don't let someone else convince you of doing anything you don't want to. It took me 7 weeks to stop being in pain with every feeding, but I was determined to give my son what was best for him, breast milk.<br>  <br>  As for good tips, you need to find the best position for you. You can try the regular cradle hold, football hold, and side lying. You should be able to speak with a lactation consultant at the hospital before you leave. The hospital should also supply pictures of each hold or you can go online and Google it. I used a boppy pillow until my son was bigger because it brought him to the level of my nipple. Try to shove as much of your nipple into your newborns mouth as possible until he/she learns how to latch on well. The further up the nipple into the areola as possible, the less pain you'll feel. Use Lansinoh Lanolin gel after every feeding even if the first few don't hurt. This will help to keep you from having nipple soreness/tears/rawness and it helps your baby latch on better. If you're having issues getting enough of your areola in the babies' mouth, then you can get the latch assistant product, which helps suck your nipple outward by elongating it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, let me know if you have more questions.
0GqYeMVWaa	serious answer: when i was about 10 weeks pregnant,i got terrible pelvic pain(infact they took me in hosp twice it was that bad).they said that it might be an eptopic pregnancy(where the baby grows in the tubes,not the womb).that wasnt the case at all.my body just didnt like the adjustment to being pregnant and the shifts in muscles etc etc.it felt like hell and the only thing i could do was to walk lots and lots to try and ease the pain.it did finally go after my hormones had goten used to my new situation.good luck and hang in there.but go to ure midwife and ask her to check you out if you really want some peace of mind.aint it great being a woman!x|`|Nux5S6oVaa	It's constipation.<br>  <br>  1.

If it gets severe you can take a stool softener as long as you don't take it all the time. For the gas you can take simethicone. It's in Rolaids anti gas. That's safe in pregnancy according to my doctor and will help relieve the gas pains.|`|kT7GVOosaa	colic is when a baby wont stop crying because of gas build up. <br>  <br>  as for your question, you should take gasx or tums till the pain goes away. tums work for me but I don't get gassy all that much.
ByUS0k8waa	My Dr moves on to injectables.|`|AA12306087	I'm on Clomid now and my Dr said if it doesn't work after 3 mos we'll start monitoring through ultrasound while taking Clomid, and if that doesn't work we'll move onto injectables with Clomid.  Hopefully I don't get to that step though :)  Good luck!|`|2f6diQBiaa	If it doesn't work for us while on Clomid (+ IUI), we're moving on to injectibles + IUI.
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? It is rude.. Your smart woman I'm sure, your capable of understand why someone wouldn't want to take their kids to a certain park. Not sure why she is doing you this way, you might want to bring it up to her, and tell her you don't appreciate it.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	i think it has nothing to do with being a mother and all to do with being rude. some people are just really insensitive!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	She just sounds bitter that you have a free life and she's tied down to work, kids, family....she can't come and go as easily as you can and she's jealous.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	I don't know, because I haven't got a bitchy jealous bone in my female body. but I do know that women can be terribly bitchy about anything.<br>  she's maybe jealous of your freedom (grass is greener) or she may be insensitive or rude or ignorant or feels superior.<br>  I noticed a lot of comments while I was trying to conceive and not being successful. Then I had 2 beautiful children and still got b1t chy comments.<br>  we can't win|`|pDGVTLoFaa	I agree that your friend is rude. I have an older sister and brother both married for over 20 years they made decisions not to have children where as I have four and I think nothing of it like you they have nieces and nephews and friends with children,take no notice some people are narrow minded. x|`|vGxipYJnaa	Possibly jealousy? She may feel sort of snowed under with the stresses of having kids. I'm a mother of three but I have plenty of friends without children - it's actually nice for me not to talk about diapers, colds, and vaccines for a change!|`|en9Xk0h2aa	I swear there's some women in this world who think they know absolutely EVERYTHING as soon as they become a mother. A woman I work with is like this. Is constantly saying what you should do concerned with bringing up kids.<br>  <br>  And I wish I had ￡1 for ever time she has said to me "Bringing up a child is the hardest thing you will ever do". Well, yes I know that, but at nineteen years old I don't really care about having kids!<br>  <br>  She is probably one of those women, she thinks she knows it all now she is a parent and likes to patronise people, but just ignore it. I am inclined to agree with other posters who say she may be a tad jealous because you're clearly a strong minded woman who doesn't need to get herself up the duff to feel involved.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Dude thats what i'm saying too...i have children from another girl but my fiance does not and they ALWAYS give her crap about it. Well when are YOU having children. "Oh you probably don't love them as much" and blah blah...i think those kind of women usually have bad marriages and hate their lives...and are probably jealous of women that have a great career.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	maybe they feel superior, because they have experienced something that other women haven't|`|4WyUrWaIaa	She's so consumed in herself, I bet she doesn't even realize she's doing it ! You can take things like this to heart. You made that decision, because it is what you wanted. If she thinks that someone who doesn't have children won't understand the dangers surrounding children in today's society, it just goes to show how dimwitted she is !<br>  <br>  It doesn't take a parent to spot a child in danger ! <br>  <br>  If she says anything again, confront her. Tell her you won't stand for it, and that your personal life has nothing to do with her, so quit mocking me, and dumbing me down ! <br>  <br>  Toughen up, and keep your head high. You have everything & anything to live for.|`|6nUprmu5aa	That does sound kind of rude, but I don't think she intended for it to be that way. I myself have a 8 children, but there are plenty of areas I'm not experienced in. My husband and a friend were once trying to fix a car and I commented that it looked really easy. My hubby told me I didn't understand because I'd never worked on a car before.  If it's an area you're not familiar with, try seeking information about it(like asking your friend what you're asking us), instead of getting offended.|`|Ge8xMTgRaa	Well, for one, she probably envies your freedom. Once you get married and become a mom, freedom is what lacks in a woman`s life! The freedom to come and go, travel, date, party, sleep! Some mothers do envy that lifestyle because they can`t do it anymore! While she`s changing diapers or running around with her kids you`re calmly reading a book or traveling around the world. Her comments seem envy to me.<br>  Or, she feels she knows more than you do just because she has the experience of marriage and kids, which to an extent, women do grow and mature...however, no reason to say those things to you. <br>  What you should do is...stay away from her if her comments hurt you or offend you in any way...that`s why most mothers look for friends who`re also mothers, and singles look for single friends, because their interests are the same. <br>  I`m not saying you can`t be friends with a mother...but stick to the nice open minded ones! This one is clearly...closed minded.|`|HWtG9dkzaa	It sounds to me that she's feeling slightly bitter that you've not had kids, and therefore have nothing tying you down except work commitments. Unlike her, you're in a position to do what you want, when you want to do it. All the money you earn is your money, and you can do what you want with it (after paying bills, etc)<br>  <br>  I get the same from my friends, who all have children - and cannot do the things they used to do. My boyfriend and I (we're both teachers) and have decided not to have children, and therefore we go on one or two cruises every year - normally with Cunard, and have sailed to various fantastic destinations, as well as getting in some fantastic mini breaks during half terms!<br>  <br>  Our friends resent us slightly, because we're free from the responsibilities of raising a family. That unlike them, we're able to go on more holidays. We've got 'nicer' furniture - as we don't have to worry about children "trashing" it. <br>  <br>  Mind you, I suppose I get the best of both worlds really. I spend most of my time working with children between the ages of 4-6, so I get all the joy of the funny things they say, the fantastic imaginations they have at that age, their willingness to learn - without all the day to day maintenance or expenses.|`|xRUZkFU9aa	She thinks she knows better, but she is really just jealous of you. I hate women like this. Just because you have kids doesn't mean you have opened some unknown/respected box of wisdom for yourself, and now you can preach to others. Next time, when you're talking and she asks something tell her " Oh you wouldn't understand, you're life is already over".<br>  <br>  <br>  LOL ok, her life isn't over..but just to give her a taste of her own medicine. Having kids is great..but she doesn't need to be such a bitter broad.|`|zTLjmrKtaa	Some people can only value themselves by devaluing others.  They are generally frightened of facing their achievements because they see themselves as failures.  They therefore attach a skill or talent to their life experience that they then represent as unchallengeable, like parenthood or some other life experience that can be used to separate them from others.<br>  <br>  It is called 'displacement'.  It is also common in people who have suffered abuse as children.|`|ptOoGjRvaa	How many times are you going to ask this question? Is it your 3rd time? Your 4th time? What is it that you want to hear from those answering before you are satisfied?|`|tbESsT2daa	Because they're secretly jealous of women with no children, because they themselves don't have an independent life away from their children =P|`|oGbHyZR8aa	I hate when women do that.<br>  She's just stuck up.<br>  <br>  Even though you don't have kids, it's not like you aren't "old enough" to understand.|`|NtFWoBHsaa	She wants to put on the aire of superiority and knowledge.  Actually, she has low self esteem.  Also, she is jealous of your freedom.|`|vJKVgAZdaa	They're either jealous that they still get to live their life, or feel it's their duty to have children by now.|`|P24Ysh2taa	believe me girl shes jealous of your life stile ha that's why, how dare she this makes me so angry in one way , i remember i was married for 13 yrs and always wanted a child but could never have and this so called friend whom i felt close to was having a baby and i was so glad and happy for her and also excited cos i thought i could baby sit  for her and then come home this way i was getting experience and they was getting a night out, well her hubby went away and i said come to mine we will have time together shop and i was nitting for her baby, , i made her so welcome in my home and 1 night she said to me as i was nitting a baby grow you know linda you will  never no what its like to have a child, i was gutted wondered how she could be so cruel and i said nout but found out latter she was jealous i could go out when i wanted with my hubby and hers just simply went out without her and for a week at a time, well i did have a lovely baby girl and she is 21 now i finally had her at the age of 34yrs shes jealous Linda

GE9dgLXKaa	I always test twice a day.  I buy the cheap internet ones and they work great for me!  I test around 10 am and again at 7 pm.  That works great for me.  I always seem to catch it.  Good luck girl!!!|`|VLhYnMXIaa	if the surge happens in the morning, testing by 12pm or 1pm should catch it.  if it is an afternoon/ evening surge, you can test in the evening by 6 pm to 7pm.  those times should catch it!  good luck!|`|stRWElvPaa	well, I would say that 12 hours in between would be the best way to cover your bases. but I don't know much about this. So what about morning and a couple hours before you go to sleep (enough time to do it if it's positive)?<br>    Also, I think I remember reading that you shouldnt use first morning urine. but research that one. good luck!
KVaLojuwaa	I think that your mom was being unfair. Your diary is ur personal property and she doesn't have to right to read it. She is probably mad at you because u didn't tell her and about what you have been doing. I also think that your sister wrong when she says that you need to apologize. Your mom should be the one apologizing for invading ur privacy. I just wanted to know where was your diary hidden? But anyway until all of the punishment has stopped u should get a new diary that hasn't been written in and that doesn't look like your other one. Then keep it with u at all times but if u cant hide it somewhere that no one will guess! Hope i helped :)<br>  <br>  P.S The new diary that u get should have a lock and key! But the coolest thing to do with the key is to make a little key chain or but it on your home key chain.|`|DwkUUQqhaa	That's not right of her to do at all. You should sit down with her as mature people (since you say you're not a kid) and tell her how this makes you feel and why. Make sure she knows you aren't looking to argue, but you want to know why she did this and let her know how that makes you feel that you have no privacy and what not. I'm sorry she did that...<br>  <br>  Good luck, and have a wonderful day! <3|`|XrKviWgSaa	both of you are wrong here, and i think your mom has a right to take a way your phone and car keys because she doesn't know what you are doing and she is being a mother and trying to make sure your safe. and you should fess up and say that you are having sex and next time put a lock on your diary or keep it with you|`|Q5GKWChoaa	Don't write everything down. That way, there is no chance of her finding out unless you tell her yourself.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You both are in the wrong. Her for invading your privacy,that's a big parent no-no. You don't do that. And two,you shouldn't be doing things like sneaking out or having unprotected sex. That is more harmful to yourself than to her. <br>  And as far as your sister goes,she needs to stay out,this has nothing to do with her.|`|VyuseWb2aa	вoтн o? yoυ нave done wrong тo eacн oтнer. ?ιr?т, yoυ мoтнer dιd ιnvade yoυr prιvacy and ?ιnd a вeттer нιdιng ?poт ?or yoυr dιary! ?econd, yoυ're only 17 and yoυ ?тιll lιve υnder нer roo? ?o yoυ нave тo oвey нer rυle? and yeт agaιn, yoυ ?nea?ed oυт and нad υnproтecтed ?eх (oтнer тнan pregnancy, wнaт aвoυт dι?ea?e???) <br>  yoυr ?ι?тer, alтнoυgн, нa? noтнιng тo do wιтн тнι? ?o ?нe need? тo pυll нer нead oυт o? yoυr proвleм.|`|QQlbvWj4aa	Ah, yeah, my mom did that to me when I was 15... not cool.<br>  At the same time, it sucks, but while you're living under her roof, it's kinda her rules.

iE7k6Vzraa	I don't really know where to start but I am pretty sure she does not like me.She refuses to babysits and she expects my hubby to be at her beck and call. She doesn't even take the kids to do anything one on one- at least not my boys. She takes my brother in laws little girl and gets her nails done. And when we talk she acts as if I am a complete moron.<br>  I got her this cool black candle holder for x mas and she looked at it like she just puked a little in her mouth, I said hey if you don't like it I can take it back. She gave me a little fake smile and acted like she got distracted. I really try to be nice to her but she is a hard person to like.|`|vGxipYJnaa	My mother-in-law is awful at family holidays. She tries to take charge of everything and gets really bossy and then says things like "why do I have to do everything myself?" even though she WANTED to do everything herself and refused any help.<br>  <br>  She's also really rude about the fact that I do a small amount of contract work (I was a lawyer, pre-kids) from home. I do it to keep up-to-date on things and so I don't go crazy with mommy stuff. It doesn't take away from time with our kids at all - but my MIL says things like "in MY day, mothers stayed home to look after the kids".. when that's exactly what I do, too!!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Of course. My MIL is pretty young. She just turned 44,and she,how can I put this nicely. She has no filter when she talks. So when we are in public or with my folks.

She will exclude my husband and I from family functions, telling his dad that she calls us and we just didnt show up, when she never calls at all. She undermines EVERYTHING we(daughters in law) ever try to do. She hates when we help, then talks crap when we don't, I have even witnessed her calling her grandchildren names, (a-word, B-word) and then when I tell their parents, she lies and denies it and tries to turn things around on me.

Don't change yourself just because you want a boy to notice you. If you want him to notice you THAT bad, just go up to him and talk to him.|`|NDU36H4Vaa	If the boy doesn't notice you, then he is probably not really "perfect" for you at all. You might have a crush on him; however, love is an action. Love is a verb. <br>  <br>  There is a book Love is a Decision that might give you a real idea about love. Love is patient, love is kind, love is not jealous, love is not prideful, love is not selfish... (source Corinthians). <br>  <br>  You might consider figuring out what your special gifts and talents are, then invest your time into these pursuits. Find some cause or hobby that you enjoy (birdwatching, soccer, volunteering at a non-profit animal shelter or pregnancy center) and the allow God to bring the "right" person into your life. <br>  <br>  The right person WILL notice you. They will honor you and respect you. They will value what you say and be more interested in seeing you fulfill your destiny in life than having your serve their needs & desires. The right person will think your are special and will not want to spend their life without you. <br>  <br>  You will not find love if you do not develop yourself & know yourself. As well as really learning what true love is and is not before you try looking for it. <br>  <br>  For more information on love - if you want to find it you must know what you are looking for, learn about it here: <br>  <a href="http://www.marriagebuilders.com/graphic/mbi3000_intro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marriagebuilders.com/graphic/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.marriagebuilders.com/graphic/mbi3200_love.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marriagebuilders.com/graphic/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.marriagetoday.org/site/PageServer?pagename=mtrl_home" rel="nofollow">http://www.marriagetoday.org/site/PageSe...</a><br>  <br>  Here is some information on how to ruin "love" as well.

What you need to do is just keep him updated about the baby but discontinue the relationship. Get going on making sure things are in order and you're ready for when your baby gets here. He is always going to be the baby's father and I hope he wants to have a relationship with him/her. You don't need to be in a relationship in order for him to be a good dad to your baby.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	alcoholism is very hard to overcome. if he really is someone you truly love, you need to help him through this and be more supportive rather than just giving ultimatums. dont get me wrong, i know its hard on you, but if you really want him to get better he needs help. he needs to go to classes and you need to go with him. they'll let you know there exactly what each of you can do.|`|AA10967880	tell him he has to go to an aa meetin and get support. as a mother you have to do what is right for your child no matter how hard it is on you. im personally blocking my mother in law out because of her evil ways.

My husband's aunt's name is Ruby Lee but everyone calls her Lee ... very pretty name though.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Violet Ruby D!|`|igMh0iL3aa	Both are pretty and elegant but I like Ruby more|`|HnNJAJeJaa	Think Ruby is a lovely Name....|`|UbCzA2JVaa	I love Ruby!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	RUBY!!!<br>  Love that name!|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	ruby is my youngest daughters name and it fits her very well.  i love both names|`|JZMfUDylaa	Violet! I love that! I think it's better!|`|To1nHfpuaa	my 3 year old is named ruby... i really do like violet though|`|OLl5Zc6baa	violet|`|addec7857a715f2e28715837812ec5fbaa	Rulet|`|JU351q6Naa	I love both the names but if it was me i would choose Violet|`|iD6LwGMyaa	Ruby Violet D...<br>  <br>  This way you get both names, no VD initials and even though Ruby is popular Violet is gaining headyway seeing as Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck's daughter name is Violet. <br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  Violet Ruby D...<br>  And say to hell with those critics on the VD initials. Venus de milo has the initials VD. - She is Aphrodite - Greek Goddess of love and beauty.  Definitely not shabby at all.|`|3S2gw8D1aa	Both names are classy and beautiful! I love Ruby the most, it's such a charming name and has a certain spark to it that I love. Violet is a great name but for some reason I always hear violent, but this is probably just me (lol). I think Heidi and Ruby would go very well together. Best of luck with everything!|`|uJU7jGtHaa	i think ruby is a lovely name<br>  i wouldnt be bothered by th vd thingy either tho lol. maybe if you named her violet you could give her a middle name so that she had a middle initial.<br>  i still think ruby is a nicer name<br>  best of luck with your second daughter, hope all goes well <br>  wish your wife good luck with the labour xxx|`|npBp2TkPaa	RUBY!<br>  <br>  violet reminds me of charlie and the chocolate factory and violet was a brat.<br>  and johnny cash sang a song with ruby in it. "rock n roll ruby" its pretty catchy.. and you could take your daughter to ruby tuesday for her birthday =D|`|CFFxtileaa	Violet.<br>  <br>  I would choose Ruby at first, but after thinking about it, it is too common. Violet goes better with Heidi (although that doesnt really matter) and it is a beautiful name.<br>  <br>  Congratulations and good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  From Kitty xx|`|hh892gJfaa	I love both<br>  <br>  I think Violet and Heidi sound nicer together than Ruby and Heidi. Maybe you could have Ruby as a middle name (but if Heidi doesn't have a middle name, then it's probably best to be consistent and just have Violet).<br>  <br>  Good luck! x|`|aEGgO5Knaa	Definetly Ruby! Heidi and Ruby just sound so cute together! Having the initials be VD when shes older might get annoying, but overall I think Ruby is a beautiful name that ages nicely with a girl. Violet..i dont know she may not like it when shes older.|`|4Xpo2eYLaa	Honestly I don't really care for the name Ruby. Violet is much prettier, but i wouldn't use it because of the initials. Have you thought about using Violet as a middle name?|`|TGUoZF63aa	I like both names but Heidi and Violet sounds better together than Heidi and Ruby. I think Violet is a much prettier name than Ruby also =] Congratulations and good luck!|`|RNJ0NRTTaa	I prefer Violet but Ruby is also cute.Why not consider Ruby Violet or Violet Ruby?|`|v2eyd0ldaa	Ruby is a pretty name and sounds good with Heidi.<br>  Violet i think has a funny sound to it and wouldn't sound as good with heidi. You've also got the VD problem!<br>  Good Luck! =]|`|0OW0zRW5aa	I love the name Violet. Heidi and Violet go good together.|`|AA11659320	violet you should call her. i hate the name ruby|`|BX4Ja1Rgaa	i think ruby is a beautiful name i would stick with it. <br>  its a gem of a name, if you get my meaning lol|`|fAN8snFdaa	VIOLET <br>  <br>  however they are both LOVELY names :)|`|758cDKEFaa	ruby sounds better|`|qR2G2WcMaa	Definately Ruby, i dont like Violet it doesnt sound nice im sorry|`|KAj7GfeDaa	I like Heidi and Ruby.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	I like Violet better.

I prefer Ruby, but I'm biased as it's my name :D<br>  <br>  Ruby Violet or Violet Ruby would both be lovely and sound great with Heidi. <br>  <br>  Also, I think Violet is becoming popular, and there's the possibilty it will become as popular as Ruby because they are similar in style.|`|L1EIX5d8aa	I'm not sure.<br>  I think Violet is a very striking name, or it suggests they are shy.<br>  Ruby, I believe to be a very out going name.<br>  <br>  I think it would sound nicer if it was Violet, cos Violet and Heidi sound nice together.<br>  Congratulations on the new arrival.|`|w0RiGbvWaa	I hink you should go with Ruby. It paints a picture of a sweet, clever and innocent girl and i think its a really nice name!!!! When you have your baby you may decide on a completely different name!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck and i wish you and your wife all the best =) x|`|6GFKXsCGaa	Definately VIOLET!!!<br>  Really pretty name. . . .Maybe even with the name Rose, Raine, or Sky!! Definately different, but really Unique and pretty!!!!!!!|`|qNUxg8HGaa	Violet! It makes me think of those precious delicate little purple flowers. And, it goes a billion times better with Heidi than Ruby. :)|`|sht6VDUSaa	Maybe try a double barrell?<br>  Like Violet-Mai or something like that? <br>  I do think Violet is the better of the two though. :o)|`|WYZPI9buaa	Ruby  its nice and its peaceful violet sounds like she'll be full of herself. ps good luck|`|DUeCxgpOaa	Violet is a beautiful name!|`|HeVXAjwMaa	I would go with Ruby but if you do pick Violet then you should have a middle name so its not VD hahah xx|`|R3KPBFvgaa	Ruby.|`|61vktzhkaa	Ruby is better. Violet sounds like a old lady name. Don't ruin her life by naming her that.|`|vw8aBY3zaa	ruby|`|HjYP8YSNaa	I liked Violet..I think it goes well with Heidi..Good Luck!|`|0kpFySrmaa	viOLET IS GREAT ITS MORE GIRLYER<br>  BUT RUBY IS MORE TOM BOYISH TO ME IDK ITS MY OPPINION!|`|md9rI5Y6aa	They're both nice, Iike Violet more.

I was 18 at the time.|`|os36Q3P2aa	i can honestly say that  we were only ever smacked,even then it had to be really bad for us to get a smacck in the first place!!<br>  My mum and dad werent really into the humiliation thing ..i guess  their view was a smack is over and done with in seconds  not dragged out !<br>  <br>  However my sisters hubby is a bit SICK   in that respect,he is on a constant Power trip  and my nieces(they are his step kids) get to ''choose'' their punishment.Sent to bedroom for a whole weekend (and i mean the whole weekend),''stand up sit down'' this is where  u  stand up  sit down for 20 mins(humiliation  covers that too ) theres loads ,too many to list ,it makes me feel sick thinking about it  to be perfectly honest|`|UCq7SjsRaa	Well, my mum wasn't quite all there in the mental health department. For about a month my mum made me walk around with "idiot" written on my forehead in permanent marker because I had forgotten something she'd taught me (I was home-educated). Yeah, didn't do a lot for my self esteem.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Forced to lick cake off the floor cause i dropped it. Thats probably the only thing i can say on here without being reported lol...|`|MTr14Obbaa	Don't remember my punishments, but made our son clean up after the neighbors dog for a month once. Long story lol|`|b9Rp0kbDaa	Getting a Spanking for chewing gum... My dad didn't want us to chew gum and my mom gave us gum... it was a cruel cycle... but it only lasted a few weeks and we only got in trouble like 3 or 4 times... My brother had to clean the toilet once though cause he was missing when he went number 1... haha! guess that makes me lucky as a girl!
Kl5kN2Qaaa	it is very possible..the bleeding could be implantation bleeding and that tends to b a brownish colour, like a discharge..i had the same thing with my 1st pregnancy, i had the sore boobs, tiredness and the brown discharge..i would wait til ur period is due and test then..i know there are some tests that can pik up pregnancy b4 ur period is due but i think its best to wait for more accurate results but sometimes u can get a negative result on preg test and postive on blood test..the longer u wait to test the better..goo0od luk :)
WPI0Z47saa	Yes a parent can turn their kid over to the state and they would have to live n a kids home. They can't just throw you out on the street but they can give you up to the state. You don't need a good reason. You could just say that I can't do it anymore. It happens all of the time. Parents do not have to keep their kids no matter where you live.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	Parents can put their kid(s) up for adoption at any age(s) for whatever reason because in the process of putting the kid(s) up for adoption they sign away any and all rights to have anything to do with the kid(s).  Basically, the kid is no longer legally theirs but belongs to the state (in foster care) until someone else adopts them or they turn 18 and are legally considered an adult (in which case they are on their own).|`|kBp9IzQqaa	In Nebraska you can just drop them off.  You could voluntarily put them in foster care.  But you sound like a troll and I don't feel like doing the feeding today, will someone take my shift?|`|2wyDALHgaa	As long as a child is not placed in harms way by the parents actions I would think that the parent can do what ever they wish to do in the way of placing a child for adoption, even at the age of 15.  Morally and ethically I'm sure that there are many (most) people who would have an opinion on this but legally I don't think there is any prohibition against it.|`|zHRWklEWaa	Yes, a mother can put her minor child in state care at any point in time assuming the farther does not want or is not fit to have custody of the child.|`|W5kLEYzaaa	Your chances being if she relinquished care of you are that you would be placed in foster care and unlikely to be adopted.|`|9yJdY4s0aa	In extreme cases, a parent can part with a 15 year old child whom they simply cannot control.  However, this is not adoption.  in the US, the child would be called an emancipated minor if he or she was living with some other relative or friend.  Again, this is a very extreme situation and certainly wouldn't be readily permitted for every parent who just "cannot cope" with the teenager.|`|bvANHTbEaa	Yes you can do this, but if, and im sure when, she tries to re-adopt her baby girl, it will be very hard. Also, any kid will surely receive physiological damage from this so be prepared. Instead of giving her up a kid for adoption, try to get into counseling!|`|ftSsVFQNaa	Yeah I think you can put a 15 year old up for adoption. She would need to have someone who is willing to adopt you though. Sorry your mom says that to you. That is not nice.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Michelle|`|WEekT4b6aa	sounds like you and your mom need family counseling. <br>  cw
UnPjfLPNaa	Each test is a bit different.  I believe 1st Response makes a test you can take before you miss your period, but most work after.  You will need to read the directions on the test.  Most dorecommendd taking the test first thing in the moringing because that is when your hcg levels are the highest.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That depends on when implantation occurred. HCG isn't produced by your body until implantation which is usually (on average) a week after ovulation. It can be anywhere from 4-16 days though. Usually a week or so after implantation you are able to get a positive test result. That adds up to about 2 weeks after ovulation.
i2ff7XSNaa	Well if your mom really doesn't feel like she has to do anything for you, and doesn't feed you, love you, or buy you clothes (basic necessities), then that would be a forum of child abuse called "neglect". Also the fact that what you mother says has an effect on you would be “emotional” abuse. Both of which are forums of child abuse. If at all possible you could sit and have a talk with you mom telling her that the stuff she calls you hurts you.<br>  <br>  Child abuse can be summarized into four categories:<br>  Neglect<br>  Physical abuse<br>  Emotional abuse (psychological abuse)<br>  Sexual abuse<br>  <br>  NOTE:<br>  (Also Child Abuse only applies to you if you are under the age of 18!)|`|LABC73E7aa	She's not a perfect mother, but your situation could be A LOT worse!|`|dd5f7ac6c2748280ff3f8a594a17b9d0aa	Child abuse is PHYSICAL abuse on a minor. Does she hit you, burn you with cigarettes? What you describe is more like MENTAL abuse which can be more damaging especially coming from your own mother. I am so sorry hon. Go see a counselor at school and talk to someone about it...please.|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	Well it sounds like your mother has a lot of growing up to do. No I don't think it is right. If you are being physically abused you should talk to someone.<br>  Explain to your mom that it really hurts you the things she say's. But in return you should be respectful. But it sounds like you two should really talk. Your mom needs to be the adult in this situation and shape up.|`|ONe2T42Vaa	Well. It depends on how old you are. If you are 16 and up. Then NO! Thats wrong. If you are younger than that, then she just might be protective over you and doesn't know any other (nice) way to show it.<br>  Just stick  in there until you are older, you have lasted this long.<br>  <br>  Hope I could help.|`|keTNfOOhaa	Its not really child abuse. But the fact that she is doing those things suck. You should probably call childline or something|`|yT6zLXBHaa	no shes not treating u right but it surly isn't child abuse ( SHE HASN'T TOUCH U IN ANY HARMFUL WAY) AND at least she apologizes after wards maybe she just loses control and gets very angry and doesn't know what to do.She loves u but when shes angry  she doesn't know what to do so try not to make her made please!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|hNIof0lbaa	No, I think your mom is crazy. Parents shouldnt stand there and call their son or daughter NAMES! Thats pure ignorance. Let her know how much it hurts when she calls you these names & that saying sorry does not make things better. You have a right to call your sister.
bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Could you be more obvious..? No. <br>  ..And if you're 16,why does the myspace say "15"....Hmmm?<br>  <br>  I think you should do your homework instead of goofing around and fishing for compliments.|`|dPgP28Aiaa	No hahah but then again he's not my type. And I'm guessing this is you?? I love your sneaky way of getting compliments :D|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	If you're looking for compliments, you probably won't find them in the toddler section.|`|2MoU921aaa	Hhaha you could have sed do you find me cute. lol , u could be gd looking but you need to shave and the camera angle isn't great :)BUt yh|`|doHNEvf8aa	um sure but the camera is at a weird angel. and i think its really girly to takes pics of yourself dude.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	no but im 20 and really dont find kids sexy sorry|`|793RNStWaa	First, be aware that you posted this question in the "parenting and pregnancy" area, subsection "preschoolers."  You might wanna delete this and repost it elsewhere.<br>  <br>  Second, you really should take a better face shot if you are gonna ask such a question.  You have good facial features and structure.  But your looks won't matter if your personality doesn't match.  Make sure you focus on that too.  You are about that age where you are starting to worry about your looks and whether or not girls will like you - but whatever you do, don't think it's all about your appearance.  When I was 15, looks mattered a LOT - I won't lie.  But it didn't take long to realize that a cute guy with a sucky personality was less than worth my time.<br>  <br>  Be respectful and polite to the girls you know or want to get to know.  Don't be rude and follow your friends' inappropriate examples - you will get NOWHERE fast and it WILL follow you all the way to high school.|`|zKM9P2kYaa	why in the hell is this under the toddler category? why dont you do somthing better with your time than asking girls if they think your cute.... oh and get a life|`|e802de1531bba8087cb150cd1a050d61aa	Why are you posting this in pre school and toddler section?|`|C2G9e7Dkaa	no|`|D8ukWu82aa	its you isnt it lol|`|iR08rKlPaa	your not ugly, if thats what your asking.<br>  kings island is amazing
WxQFe0GYaa	My advice is to sit down with your fiance and talk it out.  Do you want to have a child while you're still in college?  Or do you want to wait? Are you emotionally/financially/otherwise ready for a child now?|`|ca39ebd0432705593536475945aac794aa	Well, depending on your age, I would wait until you are finished with school.  Your body needs some time to recover from a miscarriage and with starting school, it will be a heavy load on you, stressful which could result in another miscarriage.  Wait until you are done, it's only 2 years after all, not to mention you will be a newlywed and will want some time alone with your husband as a married couple!  Don't rush it! :)
vAjXUYKaaa	Would you go to your mother everytime you had a problem at school? I mean if he let you fight for him he would only get beat up more.|`|ygimTNzoaa	You can accompany them on this field trip... At least my school always aloud parents to come, but only by following the school bus with their own car, and their kid staying in the bus. He shouldn't be embarrassed as high school parents kids would do this with us. It's understandable with how school is now a days. I'm seriously considering home-schooling my soon to be daughter (I'm 5 months pregnant). Since I've heard horror storys of my older sisters daughter saying shes seen her KINDERGARTEN school mates performing sexual acts. And we lived in a small town. The world has gone to a bad place and I'm scared what's in store for my new coming daughter when it's time for her to take on the world. I'm 23 years old.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Well first off he was probably embarassed that he got his butt kicked, i used to be embarassed to tell anyone if i lost a fight or stuff like that when i was a kid, (usually i was the one startingthem though), i think he probably didnt want to snitch and be embarssed to like...tell a teacher you know?  He probably just hates the idea of going back to PE and thats why he hid it.  He's not protecting the boys he's protecting himself cause he's embarassed like i said. You need to talk to him about fighting and bullying because as a result of these things he is lying. I wouldnt punish him though...you need to talk first and take it from there.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	The poor kid is either embarrassed or terrified.  In no way should you punish him.  He needs your understanding and support right now.  It's not like he's stealing money from you and lying about it, or getting into trouble from his own behavior and lying about it....he's being bullied. Punishing him will probably make him feel like somehow that it's his fault. I would make sure that he know he could come to you without fear and talk about what's going on.|`|rkDt5iloaa	First of all hes doing this coz hes being bullied, he is a bit scared if he tells u and then u tell his teacher that will make it worse and those 2 boys will keep on doing it. Just sit him down and talk to him about it, say things like "u no u can talk to me if there is anything wrong and you would always tell me if there was something wrong" hopefully he will then open up to u and i would hav another word with the teacher and head by the way, or maybe get the boys' parents in and talk to them!

Adoption is a good middle ground, your high school life will be tough for a while but that part of your life will disappear completely when you go to college, and you will not have any guilt over an abortion. Plus when you adopt, you can decided if you want the baby close or far from you, and if you want to watch it grow up or never hear about it.|`|gG2CuoF8aa	Go get a test at the store.<br>  If its postive, go to a doctor just to be sure.<br>  Once you're sure, please dont get an abortion.<br>  Just have the baby, and if you know you cant take care of the baby, give it up for adoption so you can give it the best home possible.<br>  I would say watch The Secret Life of the American Teenager, but the finale is next week. But you can watch episodes online, it might help a little. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|0TW0zoZUaa	You can get a home pregnancy test to be sure.  If it is positive then tell your parents...they may be mad at first but will get over it cause you are their baby!  Then you have to look inside yourself and decide what you want to do...don't let anyone influence your decisions.|`|Adq6y8tXaa	go to the doctors.. tell your parents they might be mad at first but they will help you more then anyone else can...|`|doHNEvf8aa	make sure you are pregnant before you do anything. get 3 pregnancy tests incase one turns out a false posoitve. then if you are, see a doctor right away so you can start taking the vitamins need for your baby. also tell your parents and ask them what they think you should do. most likely you can't take care of it by yourself so adoption is always an option if needed. get your bfs opinion to, but remember this is your body and your baby, its more your decision then it is anyone elses so don't do anythign you don't feel is right.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|zMj2ikmeaa	First of all you need to talk to a trusted adult....school counselor, minister, or someone who can listen to your fears and anxieties and act as a helping hand in your attempt to inform your parents (or legal guardians) who need to know what's going on with you. It's important in matters of your personal health and that of your unborn child that they know. You need to begin prenatal care NOW.,..you're way too young to be having children and youth does not necessarily mean you're not at risk for pregnancy-related health problems and post-pregnancy problems afterwards. But now that you're pregnant, you must get the righ tmedical help.<br>  <br>  Abortion: honey if you only knew what the procedure really meant physically and emotionally to YOU. at 8 weeks along, the unborn baby LOOKS human. I know you feel overwhelmed emotionally now but that is only for a short time. I know several women who had abortions at various times in their lives (including teens) and they have paid for it emotionally for the rest of their lives.<br>  <br>  I'm sure adoption must be a difficult decisions for those who make it but please, for your sake and your babies (and for those loving parents who can not conceive no matter how much they try), please do not consider abortion. <br>  <br>  Best of luck and prayers to you and your baby.<br>  <br>  (PS to those who put shame on those who've had abortions...don't call yourselves God-fearing Christians....the mothers are victims too and need prayers and support)|`|Weo3nyy5aa	double check to make sure you are pregnant. If you are i would tell your parents. there going to find out eventually cause your not old enough to move out. and if you tell your parents it will take a weight of your chest that you might be feeling. If you are pregnant your parents are the best people who can help you. they might be mad at first but they just want what's best for you and your siblings (if you have any). WHAT EVER YOU DO DO NOT HAVE A ABORTION. I'm sorry i wrote in such big letters but i had to get my point across. You can't have  a abortion. the child's innocent. I'm sorry it's your choice. i hope you choose the right thing. good luck.|`|X9qrMXQiaa	well I have been where you are. The first thing you need to do is tell your parents and get a pregnancy test.

Whether to put up for adoption or keep?  I'm not sure.  I guess it depends on what kind of situation you're in.|`|sLERr3aAaa	If it's been 15 weeks that's to far along for a abortion. Your first hint is to take a test then go from there.|`|gSF5p3jMaa	I very sorry and wish you the best of luck! What I would do is take a pregnancy test right away because it's best to get pre natal care right away so it doesn't put you and the baby at risk. If you are afraid of telling your bf, friends, and parent(s), then I would write a letter telling them about (just a suggestion). Here are the most common signs of a pregnancy:<br>  1. missed periods<br>  2. tender breast<br>  3.mood swings<br>  4.nausea (dizziness, or if you feel like your gonna barf and/or do barf)<br>  5.cravings (most commonly sweets, but really it could be any kind of food)<br>  Also, if I were I would go through with the pregnancy but then put the baby up for adoption, that why you could continue high school and go to college and the baby would have a better life. Good luck and hope this helps!|`|ogrN3F32aa	I'm on the same boat as you.<br>  15 years old and pregnant.<br>  <br>  are you really 15 weeks along? if you're opting for abortion you would have to do it soon...<br>  <br>  but alas, signs I had would be nipple tenderness, VERY bloated throughout the day, extremely emotional, obviously missed period, nauseated throughout the day, simple stuff like that. <br>  <br>  my boyfriend is 19 (yeah I know he's older, but his maturity level is younger than I am.) and kind of dipped out for the first 2 weeks but then came back.<br>  <br>  most guys 25 and younger are extremely immature. so talk with him about it and see what he says. make sure not to over react and expect them to be scared. ask him for his opinions on what to do.<br>  <br>  confront your mom/dad/guardian. my dad has cancer and he would probably kill my boyfriend, so i went and told my mom. she was completely understanding. just tell your mom what I told mine "mom, i have to talk to you. i'm ready for every inch of punishment you're going to give me but there is nothing i can say or do to take this back." and then tell her. tell her you understand you were completely foolish for even thinking of having sex and so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  anyways, i hope it works out for you :)<br>  oh, and get a preggo test! haha :) <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|PrMMzRGUaa	Has it been 15 weeks since your last period, or 15 weeks since you and your  bf had sex?.  When I was pregnant with both my boys, I felt sick, my boobs hurt and I felt heavy in my stomach.  You should take a test to make sure.  As far as abortion,adoption or keeping it, that is all up to you.  your 14 yrs. old and have your whole life ahead of you.  if its the wrong time in your life for a baby i would opt for one of the first two options.  I had an abortion once when i was in college and honestly i was devestated right after, but now i realize that i made the right decision for me at the time.  i wasn't ready for motherhood and all that i was going to have to give up for a baby.  Good luck and I hope this helped.  Oh and it might help to talk to a close friend about it too so you don't feel so alone.|`|FN3UFa9saa	Woah thats a tough situation, you need to visit a doctor immediatly, not only to get tested but to make sure things are going smoothly<br>  If you honestly feel like you can handle a baby and you have some type of support ( family or friends) then you should keep your baby. <br>  Or adopt....its a hard choice but will ensure your baby has a normal life<br>  <br>  NOT ABORTION PLEASE, thats the worst thing you can do you will not only be killing your child but will regret it later. 96 percent of all ppl who have an abortion regret it and face depression and physiological problems later<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck hang in there it will work out|`|9v4OInllaa	First of all, TELL YOUR PARENTS.  It doesn't matter how mad they get at you, tell them.  If they care for you they would help and give you support [in case you need to abort, you must pay] , second, tell your boyfriend about this and see if he'll help in some form.  If you don't think you can handle the stress of having a child or caring for one, then abort.  Just remember that it costs money to do that.  Remember, talk with your parents and your boyfriend, and try discussing this with them [especially your parents].<br>  <br>  I hope my advice helps you.  Good luck.|`|lX1zpaoAaa	Please stay in school as best as you can. I have seen too many lives messed up by a pregnancy at a young age. Tell your parents! They need to know whats going on.

aR0bJqCdaa	Talk to your mother.  If she isn't around, talk to your father.  Your parents are going to have to know.  Why?  Because they'll have to supply you with pads/tampons.  <br>  <br>  If they aren't around, go in the bathroom an rummage through the cupboard for pads.  Take off the paper part, like a sticker and place it on your underwear.  Change it every time you go to the bathroom.  Maybe even more.  <br>  <br>  Brown discharge isn't a "true period".  It just means you'll have it very soon, maybe even in a few ours.  Once you have it, you'll know for sure because the blood will flow, maybe even seep through your underwear.  Which is why it's important to wear pads.  Tampons may be uncomfortable at your age.  Ask your mother how to use it.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to shower everyday while on your period!|`|PwHWJkcYaa	Tell your mum or someone you trust. (My 13 year old cousin told me!) Then get some sanitary towels and tampons and practise putting them in you pants/vagina and walking round. Also I stared a 'period box' that I keep in my room. Any knickers you want to keep especially for your period (ie they got solied with blood but are washed and fine) put in there along with some paracetamol, towels, tampons and a hot water bottle or 'hot patch'. Now whenever I come on, everything I will need is in one handy place! My cousin does this too, but she also keeps an 'emergency chocolate stash' in hers.|`|0dSZ4yOTaa	Either you've just had your period or your getting it.

Also you said in one of your questions that it was all your fault that you broke up before it wasn't he is playing mind games with you try to be strong your life will get better without him in it|`|ojHVod5uaa	Maybe he is the one that is lying because he does not want to take responsibility for his actions,or maybe something happened after you had sex that made him sterile. You said that you haven't "messed around with a guy that he hasn't known about' if there was someone else during that time then it could very well be that persons baby.|`|Ge7MnE5Eaa	ok, so he had a sperm analysis.. well, those can vary alot depending on how much sex he's had.. they tell you not to have sex or do anything and to save all of your sperm for a couple of days before you go in to the doctor, so either he didn't do that or he's lying to you.<br>  <br>  i'd ask to see written proof that the doctor told him that... and besides, there's always the paternity test...|`|sJUhwxBxaa	Lots of possibilities:<br>  1. He's not really sterile... just afraid of you being pregnant with his child. And maybe angry.<br>  2. Even "sterile" just means that the sperm count is too low to make conception likely. It doesn't preclude it.<br>  3. Are you sure of when you concieved? Have you had other boyfriends before or since?<br>  <br>  Your best bet would be a paternity test. I'm not 100% sure whether or not they can do this with the baby still in the womb, but it may be worth asking your doctor if you really want this man in your baby's life.|`|2V4JHa1Saa	either he is lieing bacause he wants out the situation ooorrr being sterile doesnt actually meen he has NO SPERM AT ALL there is still some there but most are weak and very few but it only takes one sperm to make a baby .. if i was you i would ask him to go get tested again and i would want to be there when the doctor reads the results|`|hNIof0lbaa	Im sure hes not sterile. Go to a dr apt w/him or get the dr office to fax the paper work or show it to you that shows that hes sterile. THEN, see whos lying. And Im sure its not you.

And if you know the truth then all you can do is stay strong for your baby. And hopefully when it's born you can prove it to him and hopefully he'll man up and be a man!|`|dZy0WtnRaa	I think he could be lying, tell him you want to see the official test that proves he is sterile.|`|6nFZ8NXzaa	sounds to me like he is a punk who has sex and doesn't admit there own soon to be children|`|cmK9Go1gaa	Did something just happen that could have made him sterile, like after u had sex?|`|krxnC6jsaa	And did you actually see a paper with test results on it?...sounds like you are a little naive...and he's a jerk.|`|ULvYewV2aa	I would say he is lying.

And why would he be going behind your back to take that kind of test anyway? Sounds like you guys have some trust issues, but if you absolutely did not cheat on him, then he is obviously not very sterile and probably lied to you. I would start asking HIM questions.|`|WsUSAgLmaa	He is a lying bastard.

IPl3Yh1kaa	Omg, my son did the same thing. Just like you, the straps and everything were NOT too tight. I could tell he just did not like the way his body laid in the seat. I was right, as soon as I changed the chair he stopped the howling every time I put him in it. <br>  <br>  I had the maxi-cosi, beautiful design, but not for him .I switched to the Greco Safe Seat and he loves it! Look it up. <br>  <br>  Definitely switch the seat, you will both enjoy car rides so much more!!|`|oUtEVKDHaa	My daughter loved it but now for the passed week or so had been doing the same thing!! she cries and cries in it i take her out and she is laughing. i dont' know hopefully it passes because it's hard to drive and concentrate with a screaming baby|`|qzY6TuQmaa	hmmmm some babies just dont like to b straped in. my son was like that his whole first year i sat in the back with him (i hated it to so but my husband cant stand to hear babies cry and gets pissed off) and even at one i had to swich toys alot while i was in the fron i hurt my back turning so much but now that hes 2 hes doing alot better.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	If he has pretty good head and neck control he would probably do well in the convertable car seats.|`|AA10615926	have you tried a hugmejoey?  Look into it, it may help|`|qKnE08Rxaa	I recently bought a new car seat for my 8 month old baby girl. She never liked her infant seat from day one. Later, she got used to it but she still cried a lot when I put her in there. While I strap her in, it's like a nightmare for me & my hubby. Bigger she got, harder it became for us. Like your son, my baby does not like to lean back. She hates straps - even from her stroller. I barely went out because my baby cried so much in her car seat. <br>  <br>  We ordered Britax Boulevard Convertable seat after a long searching. She doesn't cry anymore unless she's hungry or too bored. It's a really comfy big luxury car seat. I ask myself why didn't I get this earlier? <br>  <br>  Go to babies r us & let your baby sit in some of the car seat.  You'll get some idea(not completely though) of how your baby will react to the car seat. Get what your baby likes & of course the safest.|`|c412e091d6b13424503cedd6ce01d242aa	my daughter used to cry every time we put her in her car seat.  the good new, she doesn't cry anymore, so eventually your baby will learn to not cry.  what really helped our daughter was getting toys to hang from the car seat so she could play with them.  also make sure he is not too cold/warm.  we were putting our daughter in a full body jacket and she hated it, she was either to warm or she couldn't move her arms, either way when we stopped putting her in it, it helped her too.  good luck!|`|olKKT2LTaa	My son used to do that too. We bought him a forward facing car seat and now he is fine. I think it was because he couldn't see us or anything else in the rear facing one (travel system seat). The only thing that seemed to calm him a little was if I sat in the back so he could see me. Of course someone else then has to drive. Try some toys for distraction. Failing that maybe it's better to invest in a seat or keep car journeys to a minimum for now.|`|AA12254963	well what we do is have a happy time before he goes in the seat. He used to scream as well. but now we tell him "alright ethan we're going bye bye", put him in and keep talking to him. he eventually stopped being so upset about i think being strapped down.<br>  Also, another idea i just had for ya is to put him in the seat when your not going places, get him used to the seat (or laying back)...Read him a book while he is in the seat then take him out. <br>  Repetition is the key! Dont give up!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|m9fHx9Zaaa	First of all  know that you are not alone and that this too shall pass.  My son did the exact same thing which initially made me a prisoner in my home because I dreaded taking him out.  I realized that it was not the seat because he did fine in the seat at home, he simply did not like the motion of the car. Fortunately when he was about 3 months old just before I went back to work he just stopped.  I guess he got used to the motion of the car, and now he loves it.  In fact he falls asleep most trips.
cfdooGylaa	It may regenerate itself but call your doctor.|`|hoX7hoINaa	You should not be losing it until you are at least 31 weeks. Call your doctor|`|27m0O7wPaa	You should call your doctor and possibly get an appt to see them.  You should not lose your plug until you are 36 weeks or farther.|`|T389Yzi3aa	4 kids too - you should NOT be loosing your plug......get to a dr....and get off your feet<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck
mo94lXZhaa	you should try to rub in circle with your fingers just above your pelvis bone on both side because it is getting the lower part of your body inside more active . this is where your ovalvie are. also try having your pelvis and legs higher up in the air with your partner on top giving the sperm a easy flow into your body . <br>  <br>  all the best !|`|9U37oyMsaa	My sister is doing Clomid... It is not real expensive and she did ovulate this month so hopefully she will get a positive in the next few days!! Good luck!
yB5go5wbaa	I'm sure your baby is fine, but I'd take him to the doctor just to be sure.  I was a lifeguard and there is such a thing as delayed drowning (it's very rare, but it happens).  When a delayed drowning happens, a child breathes in water but is conscious - later, the child becomes unconscious because the water is still there.  This NEVER happened when I lifeguarded, even though I saved LOTS of kids that swallowed water (probably most swallowed more water than yours did in the bath), but we always had to fill out paperwork and assess the children before we let them go in case that did happen later on.  I'd at least call them.  Don't be worried though!  I'm sure he'll be fine but I'd call just to put your mind at ease.  Worst comes to worst, they'll have you come in and listen to his lungs and everything will be fine.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	Keep a very close eye on him for awhile.  Watch him for sleeping more than usual or having a change in personality.  The little African-American boy who "dry drownd" last year seemed sleepy and confused and had a bowel accident before he died.  Just watch him very close.|`|52U22fiAaa	No, he sounds fine.  This sounds pretty typical of bath time.|`|AA12254963	as long as his breahting sounded clear, i wouldnt worry.|`|heDtLdz5aa	no he is fine..just like when you drink water and it goes down " the wrong pipe"|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	He's fine
2V4JHa1Saa	i went into back labor at 5 months and out of nowhere front labor kicked in and i was crawling to the phone screaming to 911 im pregnant with twins 5 months and in so much fu**ing pain come get me i had the twins at 6 months tho|`|hOkmcVeDaa	Oh my gosh I had that with 2 of my pregnancys. It felt like they were kicking my cervix and sometimes it would hurt so bad id almost fall to the floor in the middle of the store lol. Id have to lay down and clothes my legs so it would stop. it was the strangest feeling id ever felt. And yes i think the baby was kicking my cervix.
i8Ch743Laa	They've found no evidence. Look in what to expect while expecting even. (A book). No evidence,that it hurts anything. Everyone I know that made the choice to do it,their kids are just fine and heatlhy.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Yes. Even Smoking PEANUT SHELLS would be bad (that's actually a psychdelic) putting anything into your lungs which in turn will go into your blood stream is bad|`|zSABr7praa	Anything that has intoxicating effects on the mother could harm the baby.  Have to ask... are you on government assistance?(I realize i'm sterotyping drug users.. but I think it's warranted given the cost of drugs)  Because if you are, a doctor can drug test you at any time, or the baby at birth to ensure the safety of your child.<br>  Look it up!|`|CRvdmFwCaa	I know people who smoke pot on a regular basis.  My one friend who was recently pregnant quit while she was pregant... but quickly resumed after the baby was born... but she was still breast feeding, so that didn't quite make sense to me.  I would say not to smoke Pot while pregnant and not until done breast feeding because you want to give you child every chance to be the most he/she can be.|`|XhIYAH6Laa	Yes smoking marijuana is very dangerous during pregnancy, and really shouldn't be messed around with in the first place considering how addictive it is.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	pregnant or not pregnant it`s bad to do drugs but even worser if a girl is pregnant|`|sLERr3aAaa	Yes is it bad people like to justify using marijuana during pregnancy but there a bunch of idiots! The same chemical that goes into the mother's system (THC) or what ever it is goes into the baby's system for twice as long. It can cause IUGR, Preterm labor, and delayed brain development. I don't care what statistics say there is no reason to smoke pot during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Thumbs down it all you ******* want I would like to add that is what is says in "Your Pregnancy and Birth" from the American College of Obstetritions and Gynocologist.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	honestly marijuana is a natural herb, so probably not as bad as smoking tobacco, but i wouldn't risk it anyway. personally i think they should legalize it but that is for a whole other section of yahoo. NO, I dont smoke marijuana or cigarettes, just giving my opinion(for all you super high strung people who are gonna freak out because i said it should be legal)<br>  <br>  Also, for all those concerned about the baby being addicted... marijuana is not addictive. Do your research people. Just because something is illegal doesnt mean it is bad. Look up the history on WHY marijuana was made illegal.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Did you know its better for a baby if the mother was to smoke pot as opposed to cigarettes? <br>  Smoking anything of any kind while pregnant is bad. Same with drinking and drugs. <br>  But a lot of women do a lot of stupid things to their body's and babies. Addiction is a hard thing to kick.|`|aJRP6WWYaa	Yes, it's bad for the baby. After giving birth it's only bad for the mom unless she is breastfeeding or smoking around the baby.|`|0TW0zoZUaa	Absolutely not especially while pregnant and breastfeeding|`|hoX7hoINaa	DUH! Any drugs can harm the baby, and cause it to be dependent on it, low birth weight, birth defects, etc|`|cfdooGylaa	Duh. Thank God you appear to be male. Amount of criticism you'd get here if you were a female....|`|AA10693194	my friend toked her whole pregnancy and the baby was born fine. not recommended but that's how her's went|`|cmVHZfjtaa	my mother works at the hospital, she delivers babies, she tells me of the stories about mothers who smoke things your not suppose to smoke while prego, well lets just say it a very bad idea the baby could end up have defects to the body, it could lower the birth rate, lower the weight and it could make the baby depend on the drug. so yea its a very bad idea!!!|`|ed1002f56c569c88815d2e5297c094b0aa	Um, yes, and if you have no prenatal care or if they suspect something at birth, they will test you and the baby.  Child Protective Services will become involved, FYI.|`|mdOocxZ2aa	VERY BAD! do u want the baby born addicted, and then taken away, and have to go to weekly drug testing????? idiot.|`|ojHVod5uaa	Of course it is bad,no drug is safe during pregnancy or anytime for that matter!!!|`|hOkmcVeDaa	Any drug is bad for the baby even over the counter drugs.|`|b4d9549d46983fced7e264d76911b93aaa	Its very bad!
bf8lx9gxaa	Lots of cervical mucus like that is actually a sign of pregnancy that most people don't talk about. Some people don't get symptoms right away, some people who are pregnant, don't even feel like they are until they're like 5 months into the pregnancy. And if your period is late, I would take a pregnancy test, if you get a negative, take another one a week later. If you get a positive, that's wonderful! And I would go to the doctor after that. I'm very excited for you, I really hope you're pregnant. I wish the very best of luck to you sweetie. And lots and lots of baby dust.?|`|ESAM0U7xaa	i'm 2 days late to and got a BFN on all 100 of my test...LOL not really 100 test, but several. <br>  i think i am gonna just go for the blood test in a few days if AF doesn't come. but i have actually had symptoms....light cramping, tummy ache, bloating...<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|wnQRhfczaa	I would say that if you're late you should go ahead and test. Just ask yourself whether it's worth knowing now or stressing about it for the next week or so. If you're going to be stressing about it and thinking about it just do the test and get it out of the way.|`|FgKTgJiLaa	it never hurts to try! good luck and lots of baby dust!!
IuJjYz6gaa	No real advice here, but I know what you mean.<br>  <br>  My daughter will be 4 in May and she knows she's beautiful and she gets told that by strangers all the time.  I worry that she will grow up thinking that because she's pretty, she's somehow better than other people.<br>  <br>  I've told her that, yes, she's pretty, but that isn't what makes her so special.  What makes her special is what's inside, not what's outside.  How nice she can be to her brother and how sweet she is. <br>  <br>  I don't know if she "gets it" yet, but I hope it helps her to understand that being pretty isn't everything.|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	Everyone likes to be reminded that we are beautiful/pretty (despite what others may say/think).  I think as she grows she'll continue to understand (through your help of course) that looks are not everything in this world.  As long as you don't live your life obsessing with appearances and continue to raise her to be well-rounded (which it sounds like you are doing a good job if you're concerned like this) then I don't honestly think she herself will believe life is all about how attractive one is or isn't.<br>  <br>  In the mean time, I say it's okay to indulge her inner Princess!|`|NOFkJd5qaa	i too am a mother of an 3.5 year old girl and she is always calling herself a princess and loves dressing like one..  i think it is great for them to feel pretty and happy as there are a lot out there that will try and take that away from her...   as long as she is not trying to starve herself i think your ok........ but if you need piece of mind, do what i did and just ask the local community nurse or doctor.  she just might like and want the full attention.
KtdlJbrOaa	Alfie is my dogs name, so I can't really see a child named that (but my dog is really cute, lol).  I really like Elliot James or Elliot Christopher.<br>  <br>  I like Ellis spelled better this way.  Phoenetically - the other spelling would be el-eece - which is very pretty too.  I'm actually starting to like Elice Rose better.|`|RjpGomsyaa	Alyssa Grace what about Elliot James for a boy|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I like Alyssa Grace and Alfie George!|`|3xoEFFOKaa	hey thats my'n the alyssa grace one!<br>  but my'n has a natalie before the grace!<br>  which is alyssa natalie grace|`|7UlGCzzeaa	i like alyssa grace and elliot david|`|oKEkKhd4aa	I like them all except Alfie.  Instead of Alfie, you should do Paul or George for the first name|`|ozATw7s0aa	I like them all except for Alfie... it's kind of old..<br>  <br>  For boys, do you like Jaxton?|`|XhPbQ6Osaa	I have always LOVED the name Elliot, but Alfie is weird to me.  Alyssa and Elice sound almost too close if you have 2 girls.  My friends' mom named her twins Brent and Brant (twins) and when we would call on the  phone and I would be SO specific and say brAnt she would say, "would you like a-n-t or e-n-t.  And that was so annoying.  And sometimes in HS bryan and ryan was hard too.  <br>  <br>  I like Elice more than Alyssa, and I really like elice but it's a little weird.  people might tease her about lice as a head's up.|`|w3ob12X6aa	i really like the girls names but dont like the names for the boys sorry|`|47M20WOUaa	Oliver and Ethan :)|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	joy-roy|`|85vDqn6naa	Alfie, lol are you kidding?
QJ17P0DOaa	congrats, your pregnant! it does not matter how faint the line is once its there its there. good luck with your pregnancy!|`|wnQRhfczaa	I would test again tomorrow using first morning urine.<br>  <br>  Most people will tell you that a line is a line and that means that the test is positive but you need to be cautious if it is completely colourless as it can be an evaporation line. I don't want to be negative and I'm certainly not saying you're not pregnant - I really hope you are. I'd just recommend that you do another one to be sure.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|HQKuzxulaa	If you don't know how on earth do you expect a bunch of strangers to tell you ?|`|QBZRtwH3aa	If there was any line at all on the positive side then you are pregnant.  My gyno told me that you don't get a false positive test ever unless the test itself is no good.
pNKBszseaa	anything is possible when you are having sex, there may of been a tiny tear/hole in it that wasn't seen, or maybe not on all the way. good luck take a test to be sure. You will know if you are pregnant again, at least i did, because i could drink milk but if i am pregnant i throw it up, and when baby 2 came i was puking milk..AHHh no more kiddy's for me tho! Good luck|`|EAzyjftKaa	You have a 50- 50 chance but it might be a virus too since its winter well atleast here and the fisrt 40 days after birth your body is just like your new born.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I wouldn't think so...but if it would make you feel better I would take a pregnancy test too.  Also, I would for sure talk to your doctor, there could be something more serious going on as far as the nosebleeds and nausea goes.  It's better to be safe than sorry!  Are you breastfeeding? If you are, that reduces your risk of getting pregnant again too. (But of course it's not a form of birth control...) Good luck!  I hope you find out what's going on!|`|d2JOgTuLaa	It's very possible. After you have a baby you are VERY fertile. I believe if you are breastfeeding  it also increases your fertility. Take a test|`|ic2B0y7zaa	Its possible. I would take a test to know for sure.|`|nfLyS1toaa	take a test to be sure|`|XTdhesFzaa	anything is possible..i know people who have gotten pregnant not to long after giving birth..the only way to know for sure is to take a test!|`|rxwR6DzFaa	Yes you can!!! Pregnancy Test???|`|6zqocFpqaa	Aww maybe :) take a test it wud be cute to have them both at similar ages they will grow up so close :) xx
WxQFe0GYaa	It's not just your weight that might be different once you've given birth.  Your whole body shape might be different.  Are you going to a bridal shop and having the dress ordered? If so, you can tell the people there the situation (they'll be able to see it, anyway).  They should be able to advise you on what to do.  It would probably be best to order it at least one size bigger than you were before you got pregnant.  They can always take it in, it's tougher to add material!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	That's a tough one.  I'd buy a few sizes too big and try to have it fitted very close to the wedding.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	You could look for a dress that has a high waist so that it won't matter what's going on below boob level.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	Okay.. Well, my sister was pregnant when I decided to get married and she was due September, I got married in January. She went up 1 size as she was still pregnant when they had to be ordered. But when we went for the final fitting it was too small and had to be let out, which made it up to the next size. So in all she went up 2 sizes. <br>  <br>  Its probably easier to go a little bigger as you can take it in, just incase!|`|dPHUbKbmaa	I had almost the exact same dilemma - I was the matron of honor in my sister's wedding on Nov. 8 and delivered on Sept. 25 - 6 weeks prior. All I really could do was order my dress in one size bigger than I normally wore and hope for the best. Luckily the dress fit well, but my boobs were still huge so I just had to have the spaghetti straps raised a bit. But that took no time at all for a tailor to do. Hope this helps - good luck!|`|F7i4heAcaa	Sorry to say but you're definitely gonna have to wait until you have the baby to get the dress. Or you can have it tailored later on. My baby is 4 months and I'm still bigger than a dress size up from before I got pregnant.|`|OSaG06Ryaa	Buy a dress that fits your boobs NOW (with a little extra room as when you start nursing, your breasts will engorge when you start feeding). As for the tummy... I would buy a dress that is one to two sizes larger than what you wore originally... and buy a corset!
7xit1ogxaa	Okay, first off after you have a positive that generally means you will ovulate in the next 12-36 hours, so you could actually have 2 positives in a row. Secondly, just because you have a positive and you have sex on those days does not guarantee that you will become pregnant. You have a 20% chance of conceiving each month, and that is when you have sex close to or on ovulation. Relax, it will happen in time. It can take normal, healthy couples up to a year to conceive.|`|sR3gcvubaa	They say the best thing is to have the sperm waiting on the egg. So I would say bd when you anticipate O, but since you did it yesterday you should be covered.  If you can and want to I would do it today too just to cover your bases. There is no guarantee that anyone will get pregnant any month regardless of how perfect you timed it.  You just have to be patient and aware of your own fertility and body. Luck to you!|`|savIDjYyaa	You are supposed to have intercourse within 24 hrs of having a positive, and then every other day there after ( the every OTHER day is to allow him to produce a good number of swimmers).  You are not GUARANTEED to get pregnant b/c every woman is different, but at least you are increasing your chances and at least you ARE ovulating.  I got pregnant after using 3 kits but my problem was I wasnt ovulating (enough) I guess you could say. I had to be put on medicine to help me.. but hopefully it'll work for you.. Lots of Baby Dust to you!!|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	As soon as you get your first positive, start having sex. If you absolutley can not have sex today, then have sex first thing in themorning. The positive indicates that you will ovulate within the next 24-36 hours, so if you had a positive today also, you might not have ovulated yet. Just have sex again tomorrow and the next day just to be sure. Good luck and baby dust!
95f306dadaceae889cde62793276d616aa	How awful for all of you - that first 6 months must have been awful and my heart goes out to you :o)<br>  <br>  My daughter is a similar age and she is the same (sleeps with us and cries in her sleep) and we have tried the controlled crying/sleeping and it was too traumatic in the end.<br>  <br>  I suggest maybe trying him in his cot whilst comforting him (rubbing his tummy, stroking his face, holding his hand etc) or maybe a bed  with a safety guard on it so you could actually get on it and cuddle him till he falls asleep until he gets used to sleeping alone.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you x|`|1s3nddaYaa	all i know of is put him in his crib at night. he will cry but he wil get used to it. my son cries while he is sleeping to, but he sleeps in his own bed|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I would suggest trying to get him to sleep in his crib.. it seems like sleeping in the bed with you and your partner is already a habit. <br>  Don't start off just by putting him in the crib, and leaving him there. If he hates sleeping in his own that bad, try sitting beside the crib for awhile until he falls asleep. You can still comfort him... by rubbing his hand or his foot. Don't try the "crying it out" method.. I think that will only make things worse.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	Sounds like you are smothering him because of his traumatic first couple of months. You have to treat him like a regular child or he will be very clingy and easily upset. I support the cry it out method and it works great for me but my wife doesn't have the patience as i do my daughter used to wake up cry a couple times a night for her bottle and to come in our bed up to about 20 monthes even in our bed she would wake up crying. i finally convinced my wife to stop giving her a bottle all together and within 2 or 3 nights she was sleeping all night in her crib.|`|lFlapW8maa	what is wrong with letting him sleep with you.  my 3 year old still sleeps with me.  give him the comfort he needs sounds like a traumatic first 1/4 of his life.  he has lots of time to sleep in his own bed.|`|U6FFI7jcaa	have you took him to the doctor my son would cry threw the night we found out he had a ear infection they put him on medicine it didnt work then he got tubes it worked a charmed he sleeps threw the night|`|URbMCRFLaa	My son was sleeping with his father and I when he wouldn't sleep in his crib. Then he gradually would wake up every single night and be terrified to be in his crib even if I was right next to him. I tried a lot of different things: music, nightlights, and even laying on the floor holding his hand! Finally I looked up the "cry it out method" online and even though he and I both cried alot the first few nights, I stuck to it and within two to three nights there was a dramatic improvement. Look it up and try it. Get a timer- it's important to check on him during the times the directions (find online) say because it makes your child know that you will be there and love him in case he needs you but that he is expected to sleep alone and put himself to sleep. Basically you give him his kisses, bedtime stories, bath (whatever your usual routine) and then you put him in his crib. Lay him down if he'll let you (mine wouldn't, he would scream as soon as he knew he was going in his crib and stand immediately). Then leave the room. Wait 15 mins and if he's still crying, go check on him (make sure his diaper's still good and his nose doesn't need wiped, etc.) for NO MORE than 60 seconds. That is one of the most important parts. The other most important part is when you check on him each time the less you say the better. The key is to make sure he's okay and let him know that you are here for him and then leave the room even if he's still crying and grabbing for you. I usually started crying as soon as I stepped outta the room. Then you wait for 15 or 20 minutes and if he's still crying- repeat. It will eventually get better ONLY if you do the work and follow the directions. Good luck, it does break your heart but from seeing my son now, it helped him immensely. He now grabs his blankie when we ask if he wants to go night night. No problems at all now.
kaqPSgTVaa	You can but you wouldn't have been cramping since your last period and it have been pregnancy related. Take a test if you think you are pregnant. If it comes back negative see your doctor for a checkup.
CdJtH0xdaa	Do it in your room, and lock the door, or ask your mother to knock before entering your room (which she should already be doing). If nothing else, do it in the bathroom or in the shower. Besides, if your mom does walk in on you, it'll be awkward, but she won't be ashamed. I'm just telling you that now. Masturbation is nothing to be embarrassed about. =)|`|seJxUXHCaa	don't you have a lock on your door? if not, if any other room does ;; qo in there.|`|tbeO3Lataa	...Lock the door?|`|XzksDeE3aa	Go to the washroom or shower, and if you have an iPod with video, put the porn on it, its easier to conceal than a laptop. <br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>   :-)|`|mYb674PPaa	Lock the door, smartie.|`|frpCK0utaa	wait until shes asleep and lock the door.|`|lTsPX04jaa	in the shower|`|SoLSd9Lyaa	Lock the door and make sure that it is locked and cannot be opened by anyone outside.

Play loud music so that when you're watching something, they won't hear it.

YP1DXbBDaa	You get what you pay for with breast pumps. Medela is generally considered the best-their single pumps (one side at a time) run about $150.  Lansinoh makes a decent double pump (both sides at once) for about $150, and the Ameda double pump isn't bad either and that's about $150.   If you're going to be doing a lot of pumping, you'll probably want a double pump-I've found that the Medela really is worth the money, even if it was almost $300.
5GkCA4fMaa	I know exactly how you feel! I had the same problem with my daughter, when I went to the doctor it was just the baby dropping getting ready for birth.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Yes it gets like that towards the end and it does sound like he is getting ready to come out!! The "low" feeling is probably because he is now getting his head down and you exam next week will probably confirm this.|`|xOr67VDiaa	I had the same problem, the pain was so bad i almost cried every time i had to get out of bed or turn over. its very normal. the baby is gettin lower and lower so it puts alot of pressure on your pelvic and tail bone etc, the pain you have in your back can be from all the pressure you have on your lower body and your using your back more because the pain is scary and it does feel like everything is going to fall out. the best thing to do is keep walk around as much as you can and not sit or lay for long. im sorry youre going threw that pain, it killed me.i had my son on the 16th of feb and after giving birth the pain went away stright away ( thank god). just hang in there and everything will be fine. not long to go, i know its easy said then done but i survived so im sure you will too lol good luck|`|ic2B0y7zaa	I had pre term labor at 28 weeks and then felt pressure the same as you at 32 weeks. I went to Labor and Delivery and they told me that the baby dropped and that I would pretty much have to deal with the pain until I had her. I was on bed rest but found it hard to lay in bed all day. But after feeling all the pressure I was in bed for 2 days and the pressure went away. <br>  Good Luck
xOr67VDiaa	just the normal if everything is ok, BP check to see if baby has moved down nothing really different to the others, unless you are not well and the answers to the questions he ask, he isnt happy with.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	same as your other appointments.<br>  <br>  doctor wont check your cervix until you're 36 weeks<br>  unless something is unusual
NZid2d1Paa	well i had the same thing happen when i was about 6 weeks, i was bleeding with mild cramps, and it did start off with brown spotting, I went to the ER as soon as i found out, and the doctor told me that it was a 50/50 chance to miscarry, so he scheduled me for an ultrasound and they found the baby's heart beat, it does happen in early pregnancy. But you should get it checked out right away. dont worry too much, cause that only makes things worse. I suggest going to the ER, but keep that appointment cause OBGYN know what they are doing, ER doctors with pregnancy question dont know too much, Good luck and hope all is well.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You may want to call your doctor today just to be safe and see what she thinks.|`|WgyGipBMaa	you should go to the e.r now!|`|XOCQdyc1aa	don't listen to that girl about the home test.<br>  lmao.<br>  you could just be spotting.<br>  since you are early maybe some from previous period. <br>  but it could be a miscarriage.<br>  you'll know when you go to your app tomorrow. they will do a ultrasound.<br>  they will know for a fact by tomorrow if its a miscarriage<br>  just relax<br>  i had mild spotting at 9 weeks with my daughter.<br>  don't go to the E.R it wouldn't make a difference if you have a app. tomorrow because they wouldn't be able to save the baby.<br>  it would just be able to tell you a day earlier.<br>  just be calm.<br>  no constant bleeding means its prob just spotting.<br>  just relax.|`|AA10967880	that sounds natural if  its only light. if the blood gets heavier i would seek emergancy treatment. call your doctor and speak the them or a nurse just to get exact advice for you.|`|fa7f262b7fe76b6e718a0faa1796731baa	could seriously be a miscarriage|`|OyogBpzBaa	If you used a at home pregnancy test, it was probably faulty. You are most likely not pregnant. Either that or you are going to have a miss carrige, let's hope it does not come to that.
bspRfskYaa	Stand the bottle in a bowl of hot water to heat - never put it in the microwave as the liquid will heat unevenly and could burn the baby.  I always think it is better to heat the milk slightly as then hopefully the baby won't notice the change so much.|`|pXSKSS3daa	You don't HAVE to. If your baby will take it cold then, by all means, give it to her that way.<br>  <br>  We heat our son's up but only because we mix it in with his formula. If your baby is used to warm breast milk then she may prefer her cow's milk warmed at first too.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Breast milk is real milk.  <br>  <br>  However when introducing cow's milk you can heat it or not, its up to you.  Cow's milk is not a necessary part of any child's diet, so its a matter of preference how you prepare it and how much to give.|`|AA11100991	I would do as the baby prefers. At first, you may find that she accepts it better if you do warm it, safely as in standing it in warm water rather than nuking it. (I have heard that microwaving is not only unsafe because the temperature will vary and could easily burn the child, but the nutritional level goes down also). You could experiment with cooler milk, to see if she will accept it, but most babies seem to eat better if you warm it first. Eventually, she will not need it heated.|`|pqVZanhnaa	Never ever microwave formula milk.  I used to use the bowl of hot water method but found it too time consuming.  Since I use powdered formula, I heat up the water only first and I only heat it up slightly (about 12-15 seconds for 6-7oz.) so that it is just about room temperature or a little warmer.  Then I add the formula to the warm water.  This way is a good time saver since waiting for the milk to warm up in the bowl of hot water could take 5-10 minutes or more.  This is just my two cents...I'm no expert but its been working well for me for the past 4 months.|`|AA11508016	If I were you I would try to introduce it at something different rather than a replacement for breast milk or he/she will always want their milk warmed, and that gets old quickly. See if the baby will take it cold or at least cool at first before giving it heated.<br>  My son is 3.5 and I still have to warm his milk or he says it's yucky. Ugh.
DHyUnhS1aa	See if the police can bug your phone so you can get a tape of him being nuts.  That should probably easily give you custody.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I want to tell you that it's 100% but it's not. They will probably give you soul physical and joint legal with visitation. Some people say joint legal doesn't exist BUT I have it and it's in black and white in my divorce decree. Good Luck. It's going to be expensive but you're going to need a good lawyer to prove your side. It's very much worth it for your child. Good Luck to you!!  Keep a detailed journal of EVERY incident involving him. Once it's in writing the courts will use it.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	if your ex gets visitation then you wont have sole custody, youll have primary custody. there is a difference. the chances of you getting sole custody (meaning NO visitation for him) is very slim but the chances of you getting primary custody and only visitation for him and very high.|`|eJDfkqmkaa	the only advice that i can think to give you is anytime that he threatens you turn him in, anytime that he comes over acting crazy call the cops, anytime that he threatens your family have them call the cops so that when you do go to court for sole custody you will have all of these documents proving that he is crazy and not capable of caring for your child un supervised|`|PYYh0E8Faa	You need to fight him on this one big time! I have sole custody of my son and his dad has visitation. He wanted joint custody and I fought him and won. Honey you can win this one easy! Like you said you can support yourself and your new baby. Do you have reports or anything that can prove this man is harmful to himself and to you and your baby? Any judge is going to take your side on this one.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with everything!!!<br>  <br>  Blondie is wrong. I have SOLE custody and my son's dad has visitation.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	you have to have REAL proof of those threats and not just he said/she said. Police reports, emails, phone messages will all hold up as proof. Recorded convos usually can't be used unless the other party has been informed that you are recording them. You will need to be documenting EVERYTHING to help your case. If you don't have those then you really don't have much proof and I doubt his visits will be supervised.
zD2NWrIzaa	twerp|`|61abfb3c27511166d19130fdd59840ffaa	There is no exact time for when a baby is formed, remember it happens over 9 months. But a woman concieves right after she has sex, and that is when the baby starts to form.|`|wjGj6uU3aa	a baby has all its limbs at 15 weeks but i think the lungs are the last to develop and are still developing when they are born|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	you have already asked when, why and how babies are formed. move on not funny|`|k68J3cjkaa	It's believed that around 24 weeks pregnant is when a baby develops a consiousness which is why the abortion law limit is there. Its growing before that tho and could rsemble a baby at like 3 or 4 months.

IFDfpbFJaa	I would watch her and determine how many she can have. It's hard to say. My son usually got a small bowl at a time. I always cut them in halves though so it looked like he got more than he did. (and to help prevent choking)|`|MMj7YcXkaa	its a healthy snack!  the only downside is that she may get diarrhea!  so i would give her as much as she wants.  when she gets diarrhea, take a few out.  When it is not the sick kind of diarrhea (the virus kind) it is not that dangerous.  it will just be loose stool. I wouldn't worry about it!|`|AuFjh1vraa	What i do for my baby girl is cut in them in half and put them in a small bowl. I usually don't put very many because my daughter asks constantly too. when she says she wants a lot i cut them into quarters.
GWveqx61aa	ive never had that happen, some ppl get pregnant and still get a period, id take a test, the cramping could be your uterus growing, if you are pregnant, if it comes out negative,, id go to the obgyn. my cramps normally go away about 4 days after my period starts and i bleed for 7 days, so if i were you id talk to a dr?~☆good luck☆~?
QWTLw9DEaa	Oh my God, that's so annoying. You'd think that because of Joaquin Phoenix, people would know how to pronounce it.<br>  <br>  Well, I don't have problems with people pronouncing my name wrong (I don't have any children), but here's how I think you should deal with it: Tell people your child's name when you introduce him or anything. It's easier. Every time they pronounce it wrong, correct them. Every time. Eventually they should get it.<br>  <br>  But, I do have problems with people spelling my name wrong. It's quite simple, really. Rachel. Very simple. All the time, when I say my name, people will spell it one of these ways:<br>  Rachael<br>  Rachal<br>  Rachle<br>  not joking. Rachael is the most common mistake and it's so annyoing!|`|6SwaWSoyaa	I would think most americans would know how to pronounce spanish names.<br>  My friend's name is Christin pronounced like Kristen. I think Christin is a more logical spelling anyway, except people always call her Christine, Christian, and Christina. It is obvious there isn't an a or an e on the end. I can understand maybe people accidentally calling her Christian, but still. It pissed her off to no other.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	Well people don't get my son's name wrong because it's pretty easy to figure out, but they get mine wrong all the time. It's Kellye..just like Kelly but with the extra E. I just correct people all the time and move on.|`|pSkPC3sbaa	I don't have any kids I'm still a kid!<br>  Well people pronouce my name wrong and some people who don't know me spell it wrong but there is to ways of spelling my name though.<br>  I have one of the easiest name ever|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Ugh, yes. My daughter's name is pronounced "Cay-dence", people pronounce it "Cah-dens" Oh boy is it irritating! I'll keep correcting them over and over again until they say it right. :o)|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Because of Joaquin Phoenix I know how to say it, LOL.<br>  <br>  Mikael gets mispronounced as Michael...I just say the name correctly. I try not to get too annoyed about it.|`|mtAqANKfaa	well i don't have children but at school teachers used to call me <br>  Arva, when its ment to be pronounced ayva :(|`|msNXomjTaa	Well, if you give a child an unusual or rare name, you can expect this!  I had never heard of the Wa-keen pronunciation until this message.  I would have said "Joe-ah-kwin" myself.  And I am a person that really tries to get names right!<br>  <br>  My fiance has a native name that was spelled wrong when the Indian agent recorded it.  No-one can pronounce it correctly!  It happens.  My last name is very simple, and common, but spelled wrong at least 3/4 of the time.   I live in a very ethnically diverse area, and when I see my daughter's friend's names written, I cannot tell what sex they are, where they come from, or how to pronounce them until she tells me.  I expect if I ever moved off to some other part of the world, the same would happen with mine.<br>  <br>  No biggie; life is way to fun to dwell on something so simple.|`|vSTihS5uaa	I go through the same my daughter is named Mykel pronounced like it is spelled like the boys name just spelled differ ant. As she got older it happened less. I really like the name you gave your son and  I would imagine most people get it right. But just understand that those who don't aren't getting it wrong on purpose they just don't understand spanish pronunciations be patient and realize you may have to correct a lot of people. This will at least open conversations up to where you can brag to others about what a wonderful son you have.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	i know how you feel! my sons name is dominic. i thought it was simple enough (dom-i-nick) but i get people that pronounce it dominique (like unique). i realize that it is just the female version of the other but if you can clearly tell he is a boy, why would you use the female pronunciation? i find it insulting...|`|AA11615972	We have the same problem. My daughter's name is Reagan...pronounced "Ray-Gan" like the president...people always call her "Ree-Gan"...it annoys me...plus, she gets mistaken for a boy alot...which to me is weird because Reagan is an OBVIOUS girls name...it's much more common for girls to have it than boys but people always think she is a boy UGH.|`|h8mWBh34aa	I don't have any kids but, my name is Bhumika (Boo-me-ka) and people pronounce it wrong all the time. They even make up their own nicknames for me cuz they can't say it right grrr... it gets annoying at first but now its funny. Seeing people mess up and getting aggravated. The most annoying part  though are the nicknames like Boom Boom wtf??? They call me that. It makes no sense.!!|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	That is bound to happen if you give your kid a name that isn't common, or isn't spelled the way it sounds.  I only know how to pronounce Joaquin because  of the actor Joaquin Phoenix.  otherwise I would have probably messed the name up too.|`|XX2mcmZdaa	yes it is very frustrating my daughters names get  pronounced wrong all the time their names are mykaela and maryah and it just drives me nuts but i just correct them and go on thats all you can do good luck!!|`|NuDz9t0vaa	maybe you could try to tell them a way to remember it. like that one lady said she knew someone with that name. like somone who is famous or something. that should help because it will help them remember it and help you not to get upset or annoyed. hope this works!|`|KAj7GfeDaa	So that's how you pronounce that name! lol I've seen it before and had no clue how to pronounce it. I knew it was a boy's name and that's about it. I'm going to say people mispronounce it because like me had never heard it said before.|`|AA11210211	I haven't mine is pretty east,Victoria and my children's are Caden and September.I did however know how to pronounce your sons name because of Joaquin Phoenix,I LOVE your sons name.|`|VGij9p0Taa	I don't have any children however in the UK the name Calista isn't popular and even though the name looks easy to say whenever someone meant this girl with this name they couldn't pronounce it. Calista would be driven crazy by it lol. However I do feel if people give their children unusual names isn't it more likely that other people will struggle saying it and I feel even though it must be really frustrating when people say the name wrong they shouldn't be blamed. To tell you the truth I even given the instructions on how to say your child's name I can't say it. Damn! So I feel, no offensive, if you want to give your children a 'different' name you must be prepared for people to say it wrong. Good luck with your little boy and God bless!|`|vGxipYJnaa	Joaquin isn't all that uncommon of a name - I'm surprised it gets mispronounced so often! <br>  <br>  The only bad mispronunciation of one of our kids names (Adele) is "Ad-a-lay".. it's happened a few times now.|`|yNxYYHszaa	I don't have children but the names I like are spelled mostly the way they are pronounced.|`|xLabGD6Maa	This is why people need to really think about what they name their kids.|`|qayCggxMaa	My daughter's name is Anastasia.  I had never heard it pronounced any way other than (what I assume is) the typical American way - Anna-stay-ja (ok my phonetics aren't great but you get the idea).  As soon as we named her that though it seems like everyone started using/calling her the European pronunciation of it (Ah-na-sta-see-a). A bit aggravating, but generally easily corrected.<br>  <br>  More odd, we named my son Isaac.  The typical, normal, biblical name.  Pronounced I-zaq (or sometimes I hear it I-sick).  But for some reason, some people see it and call him Isay-ic or something like that.  There is one woman who continues to call him that even after I've corrected her...
dtZ3tmoRaa	I just went through this not long ago and posted this same question and although I did not get a positive I did have some people (including my mom) tell me that they did not get a positive until up to 3 weeks of being late for their periods. So don't give up hope yet. BABY DUST to you and good luck!!!!|`|qGeTeZRnaa	It is possible to be pregnant. People never seem to believe this but my sister didn't know was pregnant till she was almost 5 months. She took test and they kept coming up neg. She finally got tired of neg test and no period for 5 months she went to the doctor. I think you should wait another week and if you still get a neg and you haven't started I would go to the doctor just to be sure.|`|hlWdFTcjaa	False negatives do happen, it could be that the HGC levels in your urine were not high enough for the HPT to detect. However the stress of your move and that you are actively TTC could delay your period. I was 11 days late last month and really thought that it was my month and the my period showed up on day 12. So I think you should wait about 3/4 more days (if you can!) and then test again, if still negative and period is a no show go see you GP. But don't get too upset about the negatives, it will happen to you (hard to believe right now I know) and I will keep my fingers crossed that you get a positive result! Good luck hun! **~~BABY DUST~~** x|`|we9sS2tNaa	If your period is still a no show then you should take another test in a week if it's still negative go see your doctor and find out what's going on? Maybe you did the test wrong? make sure you follow the directions and make sure you do the test in the morning right when you wake up to get a more accurate answer.|`|gNKW86ueaa	I got negative HPT's until after a blood test confirmed my pregnancy. I got four negatives, but still had no period. I called my gyno, and he got me a blood test. The next day, I got a positive HPT. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and don't be discouraged!|`|iIVnndPzaa	i'm in the same boat hun i wish u all the luck!!<br>  <br>  baby dust to you|`|GWCZpBEzaa	when it comes to be negative there is still posibilites that you could be pregnant! so the best is to go to the doctor and make sure!|`|NuDz9t0vaa	sorry, but im pretty sure if you get a negative, it is always correct. Could be wrong though. i've never heard of it happening

Helped me alot!<br>  <br>  Other than that walking will help put pressure on the cervix which helps it dilate. <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't take the caster oil!!|`|e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	Congratulations.  I was going to say sex, but you put the cabosh on it.  It worked for me all three times.  It's not just the stimulation, there's a chemical in sperm that does something to the cervix.<br>  <br>  I guess just relax and walk when you feel like it.  Your son will come when he decides it's time.|`|N8DxgAD7aa	Apart from the one thing you cannot do, there is nothing else which can be done and is low risk.

If you're not responsible enough to be wearing a condom then you shouldn't be having sex. And if you're not pregnant now you will be someday because of that.|`|hlWdFTcjaa	Wait another week and then test again. If in doubt see you GP.

You would be better going to the doc.  Hope I helped!|`|UF64MzAsaa	very well could be pregnant but you should see a doctor and not ask complete strangers for advice.|`|9oAwDLa4aa	Go to doc or nurse practitioner. My boobs hurt b/f my period, so that doesn't necessarily mean you're pregnant. Pull out method DOES NOT work...trust me on this one. My pull out method is now 9 yrs old.<br>  <br>  If you can't afford BC then go to your local health dept. They charge on a sliding scale and might not even charge for pills. My doc gives me lots of "samples" if i'm trying out a new pill that's really expensive, like Yaz. She gave me 4 mths free at my last apt. So might look into that too.
27m0O7wPaa	It is healing so the itching can be normal.  If your incision looks red, swollen, hot or anything abnormal you could have a problem.  It wouldn't hurt to give your doctor a call and ask him what you could take or put on it.|`|bxlYleZkaa	It is itching because it is still healing & there isn't really much you can do about it!|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Yes it will itch and maybe sting a bit. I had mine 6 1/2 mths ago and I still have days where out of no where it starts itching like mad and just as quickly as it starts it stops so I don't use anything on it.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	With any scar or injury that has had any kind of an incision itching means that the wound is healing.

KdqaGnlwaa	As far as decorating goes,  just decorate as you would for any other type of party, but of course this is going to be baby themed.  If you go to a party store you will see a bunch of decorations for baby showers and just take your pick.  The baby showers that I have been to usually go like this: People arrive, you feed them whatever you want.. it can finger foods or it can be a meal... whatever your little heart desires, once everyone is done eating you move on to the games. You can google baby shower games to get ideas of what kind of games you might want to play. Usually they give prizes out to whoever wins the games. Nothing big just something small like a hand lotion or whatever, but you don't HAVE to give prizes. and then on to the presents and cake or dessert. Just remember to have fun and you will be fine! good luck!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	have an open house no games needed|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	Cool!<br>  <br>  If boy, um maybe green or yellow, blue or brown? like something - sport? or whatever.<br>  <br>  If girl, maybe pink? purple - polka dots? like something try be unique. <br>  <br>  Yeah game, baby foods, art, many whatever I guess so, make cake!!|`|fa7f262b7fe76b6e718a0faa1796731baa	fun game we played at my sisters was put warm milk in a bottle then we played hot potatoe with it someone stops the music and who ever in the circle has the bottle in there hand when the music stops they are out.<br>  <br>  my mom always decorates a chair for the mother and father and a hat for the mother made with a silly plastic tape and ribbon the she stick the bows on it as she opens her gifts.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I don't like playing the games. My sister in law is having a shower for a friend of hers and is making a "diaper cake". You can google it. It's a cute idea for a center piece that can be used later on by the mommy.

uFrqC4Y2aa	There's no way she would be having pregnancy pains this early. If she's pregnant maybe she was already pregnant before you had sex with her but she thinks that you will take care of it. If she got a positive result it's NOT yours.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	well give us all your address and if she is we can send you gifts and money <br>  you poor baby?|`|C4ibOR7Laa	on saturday, its now wednesday, and her periods late?<br>  <br>  shes lying to you<br>  <br>  <br>  it takes at the very leaste 10 days for a test to show positive, i have an idea, go and buy a pregnancy test, a nice digital one, think they are about ￡10 take it over to hers and say you want a retest, and you want to see it once shes taken it<br>  <br>  <br>  if the test is positive, the baby is NOT yours, shes been having sex before saturday with someone else|`|ds5MCdS5aa	Um Hellooooo......<br>  I't's possible that she IS late for her period.  It's possible that she did, in fact, have a positive result on a pregnancy test.  What is IMPOSSIBLE is that the baby is yours.  Think about it sweetie.  If those two things are true, she was already preggers by the time you and her did the deed.......Sorry Charlie!|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	She said positive ha, you have check again put test pregnant front of her in bathroom.<br>  <br>  well you dumb a s s! WAKE UP. Condom is NOT 100%<br>  <br>  If she is postive. She did sex with ANOTHER ELSE. LMAO|`|H2IhRXIIaa	If you used condoms I dout it..I think shes playing with ur head.|`|xekNv16maa	i find it hard to believe that you had sex just saturday and she took a test yesterday and it came out positive. im not sure its possible to tell that early? its 3 days. and she wouldn't be having pregnancy syptems yet.<br>  <br>  but, there is a chance you can get pregnant if someone fingers you with seamen on thier fingers. so be more careful in future.|`|XrKviWgSaa	she is messing with your head probably but to make sure go over in the morning and give her a test and be there when she uses it to make sure that she isn't lying to you and when she goes to the doctor go with her to see how far along she is and if she is pregnant she has to be around 2/4 weeks at least so if she is its probably not yours|`|ki5hZbcTaa	If you just had sex saturday, she would not be having symptoms and she definitely would not have a positive test. It would take 2 weeks at the earliest. If she really did get a positive test, then the baby isn't yours!|`|mX9z4jHIaa	Well it's too early to know yet, but keep an eye on it and be responsible. If she is pregnant then you have the same responsiblity as her.|`|1h5zkAziaa	ask her to take another pregnancy test but make sure yur there & ask to see the test so yu can see it yurself|`|hcfApJ3baa	Condoms don't fully protect you!  She is pregnant. Sign can show as ealry as 2 days!!|`|epsUr7d4aa	sucks for you!<br>  <br>  :D|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	If you only had sex on Saturday 2/28 it is too early for her to know if she is pregnant.   <br>  <br>  If you had sex two or three weeks before her period was due she might be pregnant.  Keep in mind though a woman never knows when she'll ovulate so anytime you have sex you should use a condom.  Plus sperm can live up to a week -- so again there isn't a safe time.  (I have a friend who got pregnant the day after her period finished.)<br>  <br>  I think having a little bit of sperm on your finger would make the odds really low, but it is still possible.  Next time wash your hands after you take off the condom.  <br>  <br>  She's probably just really nervous and that is why she is late.|`|HpQd2zrgaa	EEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEE...|`|0GqYeMVWaa	thers no way she would be feeling any different after 4 or 5 days....i think she really is playing with ure head.go buy a home pregnancy test take it to her,watch her pee on it if you have to and then decide whether or not you trust this person well enough for the possible end results.im not cynical,just a realist mate.good luck.ps....maybe she feels crap because shes just late with her period eh!|`|mXXer2xJaa	Well I reckon its defintely possible to feel crap straight away, I'm 15 weeks pregnant, conceived the day we got back to the country from overseas & the very following day I felt like crap, everyone mocked me & said morning sickness haha, me saying yeh right, only later to find that it was right after conception so it may well have been, there was no other good reason for it, have felt great since funnily enough. Aside from that though, the circumstances under which she could have got pregnant sound really dubious, you would have to have some super sperm! get her to do another test when your there & have her show you the stick, then you can believe her for sure, or question her fidelity, eek?
7JDuae2Laa	Take a test in 2 days|`|QmWzBERjaa	Go ahead and take a test.But you may be late because you are stressing.|`|tbESsT2daa	It could be stress, or it might be that you're pregnant. I was 4 days late when I took a pregnancy test, and it came back negative but after 10 mins another faint pink line appeared (two lines = positive on my test). I disregarded the reading for positive, because it said if the lines change after 10mins+ they're inaccurate.<br>  <br>  I thought I wasn't pregnant, but time passed and I didn't have my period still. A week after this (two weeks after my period was late) I took another test, and this time after like 30 seconds there were two bright lines (I was pregnant).<br>  <br>  If you want to have a baby, and you are pregnant congrats :)<br>  <br>  I had an unwanted pregnancy, and went to a clinic, and had an abortion (its not as bad as people make it out to be). Whatever your situation is, there are options :)|`|hcfApJ3baa	I think it is a good idea to take a test at home.  If your cramps continue you might want to see a doctor.  You could be pregnant!!|`|N8DxgAD7aa	Wait another week or so to make the test more reliable and than have fun with the result.|`|hE4CXKX2aa	Maybe, if so congrats.  If not go back to square one.|`|u3In152caa	ok so when i lost my virginity, even tho i was we were safe, i was still freaking out about the possiblity of pregnancy. i never have irregular periods either. and mine was a week late bc i was sooooo stressed about it. but sure enough it came. so calm down. itll get there. the cramps you feel are most likely your period on its way.|`|Y4hmK3wSaa	HOW OLD R U!
NgeZASTYaa	Maybe he WAS awesome, but not now.<br>  <br>  Just tell your mom, and let him go - he's 16, he's a boy.<br>  <br>  Boys shouldn't be having sex - only Men should be having sex, and Men will wait til they are married.<br>  <br>  Start yourself a web page that says "Boys shouldn't have sex, cause they will get scared and run away - I am living proof" <br>  <br>  Please tell other girls to not have sex with boys - you can help someone else from having the same hard time you are having.<br>  <br>  pls take care|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	why would you stay on his case and not let him think ???<br>  <br>  He means everything but he just walked out on you and your baby. HELLO<br>  <br>  How great is he ?<br>  <br>  Why are 16 yr old kids having sex....did you really think you guys were ready to be parents ?|`|PwHWJkcYaa	Honey, how on earth did you get into this mess? It's so hard for both of you and to raise a child takes a lot! I think he cannot find the words to tell his parents, and I really hope you have told yours! He is probably scared and frightened, just like you, and he wants his space. Let him go to his mother, he will be able to talk to her and decide what is best for him. Whatever descision he makes, you will have to cope with. I hope you have family and friends around because you sound very scared and frightened to me. If you want to just talk, e-mail me and I'll see if I can help some more!<br>  My heart goes out to you, honey and I hope things are ok!|`|JAZWe8A6aa	Well both of your parents will need to know, and by law he will be stuck with paying child support fees every month in order to financially support your child.That is, if you plan on keeping the baby in your family. There is also the choice of adoption. Just please don't get an abortion, the baby shouldn't have to pay for your mistake. Who knows, you could be giving birth to one of the future presidents. Anyways, you will have to figure out how to financially and emotionally support the baby if you choose on keep it within your family. If you plan on giving it up for adoption, there are plenty of adoption agencies out there. But really, best of luck.|`|NYJgiVxraa	thats horrible if he luved you, he would have still been with you. ur pregnant, he should be supporting you. i say for now give him space and if he does not come back soon, raise this child on your own. that is all you can do. the last thing u need is for someone u care about to play you, espeically when you need them most. it unimaginably hurts.|`|hcfApJ3baa	He is probably scared if you told him about the baby.  He needs time 2 think. Wait about a week then tlak to him. After that talk with someon else you trust.|`|7ki9mfh6aa	thats what happenes when you are young and get pregnant. I aint gonna lie to you. a guy that young IS gonna leave. he dont want responsibilites. he wants to party and be able to mingle and talk to whoever he wants. he dont want to be trapped up in the house with a kid. let him go. cuz if he aint gonna help with this baby, he dont need to see his child or be with you. your  better off doing on your ownt than with someone who DONT care and comes around when he wants to.|`|1s6lB3Kraa	He isnt a great guy if he left you now is he?<br>  I dont have anything elas to say, sorry.|`|MW6WOTDIaa	sweetie i dont wanna bash your hopes here but he aint comming back. if he was so awesome he wouldn't have left in the first place.|`|m0SEa8Ldaa	nasty
IFDfpbFJaa	HAHA Probably! If she took the guy after he dissed her first...whateva...I'm over it. I only saw it on the Yahoo Clip on their background. I didn't watch it all season.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	try tv|`|kT7GVOosaa	why would she be?

66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	if you are "+" then there is nothing to worry about. <br>  <br>  I am "-" and the only difference is that I have to get an extra shot|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	I know how you feel it's rather confusing but the  only way I can explain it is this...the RH is basically one of the blood types that is present on our red blood cells. Some ppl have it while some don't and for those ppl who have it they are capable of forming antibodies if say for example they had a blood transfusion or being pregnant. Now during pregnancy or during the delivery if the mother happens to be RH negative and the child came out RH positive then she may form antibodies against the RH factor and if she was to become pregnant again then the antibodies which she built up would then attack an RH positive child which could cause anemia or jaundice.<br>  <br>  I'm also B+ and my hubby is O+ but funny enough the baby came out O- which means she doesn't have the RH factor, wierd huh I figured she would have been positive also. Now because of her blood type she can give anyone of us blood but none of us can give her on the basis that she is RH negative. It's just like I mentioned before, if she was to receive blood from someone who is positive with the factor then it can seriously harm her. This RH factor thing is really screwed up|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	No you do not need to worry about it being that you are Rh positive.  Only Rh negative women have to get the injection.  It doesn't matter what your husbands blood type is.  <br>  <br>  The risk is when a woman has Rh negative blood and her partner has Rh positive blood.  Although they give all women who test Rh negative an injection of Rh immunoglobin just in case someone was lying about paternity.  It's a concern if the baby is Rh positive.  If the blood of the baby mixes with the blood of the mother than she will build up antibodies that will attack the baby for having positive blood.  There is a transfer of the blood when the baby is born and therefore is not a concern for the first baby because they are already out.  They give the injection at 28 weeks and then again after the baby is born to prevent the mother from building those antibodies because any further children could become at risk.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped a little.|`|k4c24zblaa	My blood type is A- and my husbands is like A+ i think not totally for sure, but no matter what your husbands blood type is they like to be sure anyways, when I miscarried the first time they gave me a shot of rogam and then told me I had to have another shot of it at 6 months, when I got pregnant again i'm 13 weeks now so i will assume I will have another shot at the 6 month mark. Just talk to your doctor they explained it to me really well, it's very common in a lot of ppl but no need to worry if your blood type is positive.|`|NroZQN5vaa	Nope. It only matters if your blood type is negative. Since your blood type is positive, your baby's should be too and you won't have a problem.|`|AA12038508	Nope! Only your blood type matters :) You have + blood so you are good! The baby's blood type is not a factor.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	I have alot of personal experience with this subject. I have 4 daughters and am 6 weeks pregnant with # 5. My blood type is Rh Negative which is rare, and my husbands is Rh positive (which is the most common type. Now when my first daughter was born she was born Rh Negative just like me so there was no need for any meds ect....But if she had of been Rh Positive i would have been given an injection of antigen in case i was to have another child and their blood type was Rh Positive. My next 3 daughters are all Rh Positive like my husband and 3 times through out the pregnancies i had to have injections in case their blood type was Positive. Basically what happens is if you are carrying a baby that is the opposite type to you your body will reject the foreign "bad opposite" blood and our blood cells attack the baby's opposite blood type. It is truly potential for disaster for both mother and baby without proper prevention and treatment. I hope i have answered your question.|`|2WWEn2mZaa	I am Rh- and so are both my sisters. In this day and age there is nothing to worry about. Your doctor gives you a shot during pregnancy. You also need another shot within 72 hours after birth, miscarriage or abortion. The Rh factor basically treats your fetus as like an infection-foreign object and works against it. Many decades ago total transfusions had to be done on babies born to Rh- moms. Sometimes babies still had some kind of birth defects though. My MIL use to get calls from the hospitals to come in to give blood for these babies. But medical science has made that a thing of the past.|`|xCCyGtv2aa	No, Rh only becomes a problem when the baby is Rh+ and the mother is Rh-.  Most people are positive.  If you were Rh-, your doctor would have prescribed you something to keep your body from attacking your baby.  It usually is not a problem in any first pregnancy.  You might do a web search; mine turned up this page: <a href="http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/rhfactor/a/aa050601a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/rhfactor/a...</a>|`|fa7f262b7fe76b6e718a0faa1796731baa	If you are rh negative you will need a shot of rogham its done in 28 weeks and after delivery of the baby. I am o rh negative and I am pregnant with number 5 never had a problem with it.|`|9TeE1K3Eaa	No, Only moms that have a negative blood type need worry about this.
AiJeS6I1aa	This is a very normal schedule for ovulation induction with clomid.  Lots of healthy babies are conceived every day with this method.<br>  <br>  The day 23 progesterone is to check to see if you ovulated in that cycle.|`|VqmaOcUIaa	Clomid aids in ovulation hence taking it day 5 to 9 ..many have acheived  pregnancy on the drug ..I'm taking femera which is the refined version of clomid..it's way better and doesn't stay in your system or cause weird side effects.. My dr also has me on prometrium this helpss to sustain a pregnancy and prevent miscarriages ..your dr or pharmacist should be able to assist you with the dosages ..good luck..

k4c24zblaa	Very possible, it happen to me!! Take a test asap because you are most fertile after a miscarriage!|`|by8jh0Lmaa	It is very possible, but also very likely that your period is just taking a long time to get back to normal. I had a miscarriage 5 weeks ago, have not gotten my period yet, so I have been researching the heck out of it. Some women don't get it for 8 weeks or even longer. I hope your pregnant, but don't count on it yet hun. <br>  Good luck!|`|d3b6fdf2d631c2f5712339448db9e43caa	it is very possible that your still pregnant. this happened to my sister, she was pregnant with triplets, and lost 2. go to your doctor, before you get your hopes up. good luck to you.|`|2vHIn8VMaa	yes or ur hormones may be mesed up. i would go to ur OB/GYN|`|K2jT1z5jaa	yes darling it is very possible. Definitely take a test soon<br>  or blood test<br>  <br>  god bless x|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It is possible but after miscarriage it can take a while to get your period back as well.
xCCyGtv2aa	The symptoms you describe are common in pregnancy, but they can also occur as premenstrual symptoms.  Take a home pregnancy test.  There are sperm in pre-ejaculate, too.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Thats how I got pregngnat but I didnt even get any signs besides a missed period..So just get off of them for now..and take a test in a few weeks then start a new pack fresh. Give your body a minute to adjust.
ZQyAlNhjaa	I love these names. They are very grand and elegant. My favorite would have to be Wyatt Alexander King because it is a bit more unique than Edward. Good luck!! : )|`|jU3YCevPaa	Wyatt Alexander is better - "Edward" and "King" together sound too stuffy.|`|md9rI5Y6aa	Wyatt Alexander King, I'm not a huge fan of the name Edward, you hear it way too much with the twilight thing going on right now.|`|KeRqdX2Vaa	I think Alexander Wyatt sounds better...I'm not a fan of Edward.

I don't really like the name Edward, and it doesn't suit a baby or a young child.<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|C8E3fe3xaa	Wyatt Alexander King.. i hate the name Edward|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	Wyatt, sounds strong & Edward sounds too old|`|uhBkbgoaaa	none<br>  they sound too serious|`|m4amCT5waa	Wyatt reminds me of the Old West and shootouts...it's the Wyatt Earp association no doubt.  I absolutely cannot stand the sound of Wyatt, so I'm admittedly biased against it, but I really think that an honestly bad thing about Wyatt is its trendiness.  Wyatt never even resembled a popular name until the '90s, and its popularity is steadily climbing...by leaps and bounds.  This means that it probably won't age well.<br>  <br>  Edward, on the other hand, is less popular than it's ever been, but still very very noticeable...it hasn't faded away by any means and I honestly don't think that it ever will.  You have nickname options here, if you're interested in that, and it's always nice for the kid to have options too.  Edward will age well, and because it's such a classic name I can't see him ever running into trouble with it.  I also like the sound of it, personally.  The main drawback with Edward could be the Twilight association (but then again that could be a good thing, too, depending on how you feel about it).<br>  <br>  I think Alexander is another wonderful, timeless name, so I have no complaints there, either (especially since I suspect it may be an honoring name, but whether or not it is I still think it's great).|`|e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	Wyatt Alexander King<br>  <br>  Edward is a bit stuffy with the rest of the name.  Wyatt makes him sound more friendly.  In our neck of the woods boys named Wyatt are cowboys.  They ride horses and have brothers named Chase, Cody, Colton, Bryce, you get the idea.  It's a country boy name in the mountains of California.  I love it.|`|6nUprmu5aa	Oh I like both of them. But if you choose Edward I wouldn't recommend calling him Ed because I really don't like it.  I named my daughter Lucille (old fashioned) but people will be calling her Lucy. I'm not a fan of Alexander, though, What about Wyatt Edward?|`|1U3kSuhsaa	i LOVE the name wyatt and the middle name is PERFECT! i LOVE it! edward reminds me of the vampire xD the name edward alexander king sounds like a brave knight's name for some reason. i think wyatt is way better|`|tOi44Z0paa	Wyatt Alexander sounds best.  I just like it better and I think that it goes together better.|`|h8mWBh34aa	Wyatt Alexander King|`|wlCMugbraa	Wyatt sounds much better than Edward in my opinion|`|WWPbTrOHaa	honestly, im not a big fan of the name wyatt, but edwards not bad
Ccq8zEcnaa	You can test as early as 20-24 days after you think implantation occured. So I think maybe around march 9 or so...|`|WvWFmwQoaa	28th would be better wait for at least 3 weeks after the bleeding has stopped and then test this way it should be clear and you will probably get a clearer result good luck...|`|Y5NXQ0JPaa	I say wait about a week to make sure!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1UrMbDZHaa	to get best results you should do it the day of your missed period. some you can actually do a week before.

What about Kayla Marie Billy instead?  Kayla Billy sounds a lot better then Caylee Billy.  Troy James Billy sounds nice.|`|34VXCyvVaa	Caylee Billy sounds kind of childish.  Maybe it's because both names have two syllables and end in the "-lee" sound, but it just sounds kind of rhyme-y and repetitive.  (And it's even worse with all three names ending in an "ee" sound.)  Billy would sound better with a first name ending in an "-en" sound or an A.  Examples:<br>  <br>  Lauren Billy<br>  Samantha Billy|`|243bff959375fe2757f750ec38cc8274aa	Troy James is nice.  <br>  Caylee is too childish for a grown woman.

RuyLwzA0aa	I don't know if it is the same thing, but I found this interesting.  A friend of mines son always had a little rash on his upper lip and the dr. told her it was caused from colored pacifiers.  She switched to clear and it disappeared.  Something about the dye in them reacting to the babys skin.|`|SDjrojZXaa	my son had a red mark on his eyelid and on the side of his nose they both faded before he was6 months....they are very common and usually fade by 12 months....its kind of like the stork bite however those sometimes dont fade. you probably will notice it get more red when she is mad or tired.|`|BkMjabPvaa	what that lady said about the pacifiers is what happend to my sister
cAtWxJG1aa	4Ts are smaller than 4s (within the same brand you can often choose one or the other), but there's lots of variation by brand so a 4 in one brand might equal a 4T in another.  my kids could always wear shirts in either size but pants would fall right off if they were 4s rather than 4Ts.|`|AA10494763	4t has more room for diapers if the child is still in it.  4 are more slim acually and they have same length.|`|s8VgyzE2aa	It just depends on the brand of clothing. I've bought size 8 jeans in one brand that fit my son perfect and then bought size 8 in a different brand that were way too small or big. In general size 4 is slightly larger than 4T sort of like how they have size 7 and then they have size 7X. The 7X is slightly larger than a 7 but not quite an 8. They make them like that for kids who are growing out of the 7 but don't quite fit into an 8 yet. <br>  <br>  It's possible the brand of clothing you bought in the size 4 runs small which is why a 4 fit your oldest when she/he usually takes a size 4T.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I've gotten Tyler size 4 slim jeans and they fit better than regular 4T jeans (my lil man is super skinny with no butt!) 4T pants are acutally to big in the waist unless I buy the ones with the adjustable waistband.<br>  <br>  I really don't think there's much difference between the two. Sort of like there's not much difference in size 24 months and 2T.<br>  <br>  ETA: Greeneyed: the T stands for Toddler, not Tall|`|prqrQcd1aa	depends on the manufacter if it is bigger or smaller<br>  <br>  T is for toddler<br>  no T is for kids|`|cYRZpGkqaa	4t has a little more room for diapers. They difference isn't really that big.|`|lGrcLQ49aa	Since sizes are not true and can vary by brand you will not see a significant difference between 4T and 4.  You might even find some 3 and 5 that will fit.  The difference that is supposed to be between 4T and 4 is that the 4T is shaped more for a toddler body - shorter legs perhaps room for a diaper.  A size 4 should be a bit slimmer and perhaps slightly longer in the arms and legs.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Nothing. I was confused about this also but it just depends on the manufacturer how they write it but they are the same size.<br>  <br>  The T stands for toddler by the way not "tall".<br>  <br>  EDIT: All brands may vary in size slightly even if they are all marks as the same size. If you are confused then you may want to take the child with you to try things on.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	I have never thought there was a difference.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	4T is a bit samller then 4.|`|e5CuEiPfaa	Probably nothing. I think if it fit that should be ok. Its probably just some marketing scheme!
QveBSjFSaa	Awesome news on all fronts!<br>  I used to babysit my ex's "new" baby (my goodness, he's almost 5 years old now), and it was such an honor to me that my ex and his girlfriend asked me to. And our daughter together used to love coming home to her little brother.<br>  Is your son excited? If he is, the only thing that I can suggest is to have him write a little about his feelings from time to time, so he can give it to his baby brother/sister (care of Dad and step-mama, of course) for a keepsake.<br>  And does your ex have middle of the week visitation? That could be some extra bonding time as well.<br>  At any rate, let me tell you again that I admire you for making this extended family work for all involved!|`|PCsW0gbPaa	You have to be realistic.  He's nine.  His half-sibling will be a newborn.  They don't live in the same home.  They are not going to be close.|`|AA11537580	he can spend school holidays at his dad's too and invite them(step mom and baby) over for lunch/dinner a few times|`|F6lZHRkVaa	This is rough; we have a baby too and my stepson is only here on the weekends to be with him. We decided to take our stepson during the weekdays for the summer, so he'll get to be around more. Also during the week we'll drive down sometimes (he lives a little over an hour away) and we'll have dinner with him or go to his school events. That's about all we can do right now. But I feel you. I really want the boys to grow up knowing each other well. I have a half sister myself and rarely got to see her because our dad and her mom just didn't get along.<br>  <br>  The mother of my stepson has offered to take our child to her house sometimes too, I'm not sure yet how I feel about that but it's certainly an option for someday in the future.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I"m not in the "know" but it seems like you have a great relationship with these people. I would suggest you talk to your son about having a new baby brother or sister.. Remember that he's going to be jealous at first and that it's completely normal, maybe set up dates where you could take your son to see them for a couple of hours during a day during the week once the baby is born, take him to see the baby when it's born, and get him a special little something that gives him pride in being a new "older" brother!
igvUbqkyaa	Um they will probably call them Celebrity Baby Names!!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	it depends on what names are popular 200+ years from now. they might like zipt or burb. but honestly who cares its not their kid|`|CkNBo60uaa	i think we will be micro chipped with a number and names will be irrelevant as people will no longer communicate vocally.All conversation will take place telepathically using technology.People will slowly become obsolete......|`|JqA5x1qiaa	No, although Kyd sounds cool<br>  <br>  Tu morrow - weird<br>  Apple is already a name, i know loads of people called Apple.|`|iyEYXiq8aa	Some names are stupid and plain crazy, but i know someone called Hope and i really like the name|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Insanely stupid, airheaded, unvirtuous names!
62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	I gained 10 pounds in the first month of my pregnancy. but for the next 6 weeks after (I'm now at 14 weeks) I have maintained and not gained anymore weight. Google a pregnancy weight gain chart and you can enter your pre-pregnancy weight and it will tell you about where you should be all through out your pregnancy.|`|MYU46ap5aa	Watch what you're eating.  Make sure you're not eating too much junk food or sugary foods.  It's not good for your baby.<br>  <br>  Your weight gain will fluctuate and your doctor will test you for gestational diabetes soon.  No cause for an alarm.  I had it with my children and gained 70lbs with each as a vegetarian.  I only started gaining weight by the end of my second trimester and lost all of the weight a few months after the birth from breastfeeding.  NO LIE.|`|ddP3klT3aa	25-30 pounds during the duration. Some people gain 90! I gained 47 pounds. It all differs. If the doctor is not concerned and didn't say any thing, don't worry about it. Sounds ok to me.|`|45azZvL9aa	Sounds fine to me.  I've been through 5 pregnancies with my wife.<br>  <br>  My wife is pretty small, and she gained 45 pounds on one pregnancy.  Sounds like you are doing well.|`|AcxMUPdsaa	Try not to worry. I am currently 16.4 weeks pregnant and just started putting on weight.  I lost approximately 23 lbs for the first 3 1/2 months due to severe morning sickness.  The amazing part is my baby is growing and thriving and has a strong heartbeat.  Just eat healthy and know every woman varies in the amount of weight they gain.  One thing I have learned is to have an open communication with your ob/gyn and relax ( If your doctor is not worried, you shouldn't be either). Take care....yayyy for the summer babies!|`|FYDw1rjlaa	normally 25-35 lbs through the pregnancy|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Normal fluctuates for everyone...your OBGYN will tell you whats healthy for you.  I'll be 19 weeks Sunday as well (with newest due date) and I've only gained 7 pounds.  I have no baby belly at all but baby is good and doctor is unconcerned.|`|dDVAUA9saa	I'm 24 weeks and have gained 12lbs.  With my first, i only gained 18lbs my entire pregnancy.  If you are underweight, the recomendation is to gain approximately 1lb per week, or 26-40lbs.
AA11280073	It would really be a kindness to talk to her about it. If it bothers you, it will bother others and cause problems for her. Say something like this:<br>  <br>  "Mary, I know you don't smoke, but since the rest of your family does, are you aware that you smell very strongly of cigarettes? Perhaps you could wash your clothes separately from the rest of the family to get the smell of smoke out of them and take a shower every day."<br>  <br>  You could even offer to let her wash her clothes at your house. It would be a shame to lose a good babysitter over this. She needs your help.|`|ddP3klT3aa	You should really get a new babysitter. That is very unhealthy for your baby. The uncleanliness. You know she is passing germs to your child? He could end up getting very sick. What if he grabbed her feet while playing and stuck his hands in his mouth? Babies do that. What if she is kissing on him? Chances are she probably doesn't wash her hands often either. What if she changes his dirty diaper and immediately goes and makes a bottle? Your child is going to get very sick. Get a new sitter ASAP.|`|GpR5MI5raa	Well, there's nothing she can really do about her family smoking and personal hygene is a VERY sensitive issue to bring up to some one. If she is a great babysitter, I would put up with it. Theres a lot of bad babysitters out there that smell wonderful.|`|lq2Ewg5Zaa	it would be really rude of you to tell her that she "smells",so if this really bothers you i think you should find another babysitter!|`|1JsWMX0daa	you are her boss. tell her you want her showered and groomed before she comes to work. you don't have to let her know that you think she stinks. that would get to me too. you don't want your baby to get use to the smell of cigarettes & BO do you. just be nice and spit it out. "from now on you need to be showered & groomed before you come to work. thanx."|`|xbzCxo8yaa	Gingerly mention it to her.......however make sure you mention her accomplishments first and how good she is with the baby.......then bring up the smoking and ask that maybe she can shower at your place because the cig smoke is bothering you and the baby.........common sense should kick in and this should work out|`|rdBIpnM6aa	If she doesn't take very good care of herself, how well is she really taking care of your baby?  And if you can't stand the smell, is it really fair to have your baby subjected to smelling that all day?  If I were you I would find another babysitter.|`|rVFuRc6Vaa	as your baby is effected id tactfully point it out after all its your house oyur rules why should your baby or you put up with it, also i hope she doesnt smoke in the same room as the baby your not mean its awful when people stink|`|tnOZ49JQaa	I know you've heard all the statistics on second hand smoke. I don't want to be rude but I wouldn't want my baby in that environment.|`|t7hFh8STaa	I would talk to her in a polite manner about what bothers you. Probably, she can't smell it any more, and she needs some advice too.<br>  And if she is a really good babysitter, it is better to keep her as the child has used to her, and she knows all possible problems and how to deal with them.<br>  Good luck!|`|eu6UQElYaa	wow that sucks but there really is no easy or gentle way to tell someone that they smell.   If she's a great babysitter otherwise, I'd honestly let it go. It can really be hard to find people you can trust with your children and that's way more important than how the woman smells.  Just spray some air freshner after she leaves.|`|zu0W6hCTaa	find another babysitter
ESAM0U7xaa	implantation can occur anywhere from 7-12 days after OV because the egg has to be fertilized first and then attach to the uterus. it can take some time. implantation bleeding will usually happen around the 10th day if you get that. it's usually pink or light red spotting, it shouldn't be heavy....can sometimes only see brown because the bleeding is so light.<br>  i would test around Monday or Tuesday, but don't count on it to be 100% until time for your period. <br>  if your late, test again the day after. <br>  <br>  hope it works out!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Implantation occurs 5-10 days after conception.  You may experience some light pink spotting, but having any sort of bleeding at implantation is very rare.  Brown blood is just old blood.

GpR5MI5raa	theres a lot of sensitive tissue in your rectum. Its very easy to tear it. I wouldn't worry about unless it continues to bleed, Then i would see a doctor.|`|Bs06zjf3aa	I do this alot with my chick and she has no worries, having siad that im a small fella|`|zjuMrDmGaa	You got a tear higher up...KY is not the best for anal...try astroglide or any silicone based lube.|`|eDmdkUO3aa	GROSS. When you get older all your s**t is going to slide right out.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	Maybe you have a little internal hemorrhoid that you didn't know about?|`|kCSJyM8Laa	Pay close attention, dear:  The Anal Sphincter..that is the muscle that circles your  anal opening is not as elastic as your vaginal opening is.  Also..this is important...it will not "snap back into shape" after anal sex.that means it will not close all the way that it is supposed to.  Once you stretch it, it is stretched forever...you will leak.  You probably have tears and rips inside your anus.<br>  <br>  Believe me, I am not standing in judgment but I would really consider the permanent damage that you are doing to yourself...be careful
CadIYXdXaa	Like someone else said it's about self confidence. You need to start feeling comfortable with yourself and speaking your mind. It's not an easy thing for shy people to do, but if you feel you are being taken advantage of then you need to try. <br>  <br>  Try a little bit each time you feel like that, speak out or speak your mind, each time you do it the easier it will get.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Have self confindence and self worth. Don't let people walk all over you, and stand up for yourself.|`|AA11537580	say nothing, look at them like they are an alien , then walk away|`|PTdy6TWRaa	Try to get into some assertiveness training or public speaking workshops - something in the same vein as Toastmasters. It may seem like the last thing you want to do as a shy person however it's exactly the sort of thing that can help you overcome it. Usually these groups are filled with people just like you, same fears, worries, anxieties etc so it can be a supportive and non threatening environment and a great way to train yourself into having a greater level of confidence.
454bbfa3cd9f581722ab32321ee38ec9aa	You aren't supposed to wear tampons until you are cleared by your ob-gyn. I breastfed and got my period 8 months later, one week after I stopped breast feeding so I would assume yours will start soon.|`|vue9NOhYaa	YOu can expect a period anytime between tomorrow and a couple of months from now.<br>  <br>  You need to use pads for lochia, but when  you get your first real period, you can use tampons if you wish.|`|ERGlYxw3aa	after around 40days|`|pjgMW6qaaa	Your doctor won't even be able to answer the question about your period.<br>  <br>  And obviously if you can't have sex you can't use a tampon. Specially if you're just healing from an infection....<br>  <br>  Before thinking about using tampons wait till your doctor checks you and makes sure your healed...at your 6 week check up|`|MhyuXBoEaa	you are still in your 6 week healing .. don't use tampons now.. your periods will come back in about 8-12 weeks . After your 6 week check you will be able to go back to life as usual and wear tampons if all checks out ok.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	NO NO NO on the tampons.  Until your OBGYN gives you the green light, pads only. <br>  And every woman is different, your period may come soon (next few weeks) It could still be a month or two.|`|1d729bf4d6b38d30422b14b8a730ea1aaa	I think everyone is different as to when their periods start again.  I know if you breastfeed periods sometimes don't start until you've stopped feeding.  You cannot use tampons though, not for your first period as you need to let everything come out of your body (sorry, I know that's a bit gross).  Do a little internet research or ask your healthcare worker when they come to check on you and the baby.  Congratulations and enjoy the time with your daughter.|`|FfHedeQyaa	Stay away from anything internal until you see the doctor again since you had the infections. Just wear pads. If you are not breastfeeding you may get your period very soon. Some women get it after just a few weeks of not nursing. It depends on how soon your hormones regulate themselves after delivery.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I didn't get my first period after my son was born until 6 weeks later, but everyone is different. If you are comfortable wearing tampons then it won't be a problem.
miPubuDYaa	What the heck are going too. I wanna go too!<br>  <br>  Newborn diapers you dont need many. The baby out grows them fast. The are cut differently to let the embilical cord to heal and fall off.<br>  <br>  Most the sizes over lap. new born is up to 14 pounds, however size 1 is 8 - 16 pounds.<br>  <br>  size 2 is like 15-22 pounds<br>  size 3 is like 20-28 pounds.|`|v3LnJycKaa	my second was in <br>  <br>  Newborn for about 15 days<br>  <br>  size 1 for 2 months<br>  <br>  size 2 for 2 months<br>  <br>  Size 3 since she was 5 months (she is now 11)|`|OPhMTPqyaa	Honestly, It all depends. I was told not to buy a lot of newborn diapers so I got rid of most of them and when I had my daughter she was in newborn for 2 months. It really depends on how big your baby is going to be but on the average I'd say you don't need much of the newborn. My first three children stayed in 1s for about a month and a half to three months. but 2s I'd say is what you'll be more of.<br>  <br>  That is great that you an get 24 diapers free.<br>  <br>  Good luck and take care|`|FYDw1rjlaa	where do you go anyways...I want to go too...well for me, my son wear newborn size until he was 1 month, size 1 until he was three months, size 3 until he was 9 months, and size 4 after that until he is potty trained. I think that babies were size 3 longer that 1and 2 so try to get more of size 3.|`|zwJbUbWMaa	Just don't get very many newborn, they don't fit in those for long at all.  With my boy each time he went up a size he stayed in that size quite a bit longer than the previous sizes.  Don't know if that is true for all babies though.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	It's hard to say because every baby grows different. <br>  But I wouldn't suggest getting too many new born diapers, as they tend to grow out of them the most.  You will be in size 1 for a while.|`|HuKuyPcuaa	Ok well figure at least two weeks of newborn diapers. The average newborn baby will use 8 diapers a day. You should also remember this for the first check up because the doctor will want to know.<br>  <br>  They dont stay in size one very long either. Between Newborn size and size 1, I would say get no more 1/3 of these sizes total.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that most babies will triple their body weight in a year. So if your getting your getting this for 23 weeks, you could decide to get the rest of the diapers in equal amounts of size 2 and 3.|`|JIHx8ZDBaa	don't get newborn!<br>  if you have a big baby like i did, he might go straight to size 2|`|QTamy6akaa	less size

Good Luck with your pregnancy!|`|hzlqCBWnaa	im 23 weeks and i dont feel her everyday either, but i did rent a doppler so when its a off day i can just check her heartbeat. this is normal for 21weeks. my dr said around 24-26 wks is when you will feel your baby everyday. there is a small chance that something happend to your baby at this point. just try some of ther other suggestions from other ppl and if not call your midwife. :) congrads and i have a feeling your baby is just fine|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Not yet. Give it some time. Drink something sugary, orange juice is usually a good idea. Lay on your side and wait.|`|buoqtZeFaa	Try maybe orange juice or very cold water and see if that works.  If you are really worried about it contact your midwife though.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|6af54f92af054d77128a9a4892b2611eaa	Don't worry yet.  Have a drink like milk or OJ and lie on your left side for a while.  The baby could just be in a different position.  I had this experience too a few months ago, was naturally worried but all OK in the end.  Im 35 weeks and today I am being kicked left, right and centre.  You won't feel it until you are telling it to be quiet.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|Io28z8l2aa	i used to get this when i was pregnant. drink something cold or sugary, like orange juice and lie down for half an hour and relax. the baby might move.<br>  <br>  if you are still concerned contact your midwife.<br>  <br>  this can happen at 21 weeks, the baby is still small and can turn easily. the baby might be moving, but not so that you can feel it. try not to worry.|`|jsoSKMEmaa	I think i first felt my baby at around 19-20 weeks.

It will get the baby moving.  <br>  <br>  If you don't feel the baby moving within 15-20 minutes after that please contact your doctor or midwife.<br>  <br>  Trust me I have 3 children and my doctor gave me the same advice.|`|Uh2x306Caa	Go out for a walk and move around.  Listen to some music.  Something that will get the baby going.<br>  <br>  If nothing happens in a few hours then call your mid-wife.|`|F53OI3rkaa	I wouldn't worry, sounds normal to me to not have movements everyday - especially as you are only in your 2nd Tri.

m12cscR1aa	It could be a passing phase. If the Kid is mature, dont bother. Normally you smoke pot during that age just because of peer pressure or if u have nothing better to do.. Kids who smoke pot wanna get out reality cos the world is very competitive. <br>  <br>  Find out what are his interests. Completely encourage and support him. Enroll him into that particular class if required. He should meet like- minded people. Keep him BUSY!!|`|xNkmK0SHaa	I believe there is little you can do to change the situation.<br>  <br>  If your "friend" won't avail himself of information about "Pot" and set boundaries, then the most you can do is find it, print it out, and present it to him.<br>  <br>  However, if "friend" uses, he is a piss poor role model and not able to help himself, much less a child.|`|pOZubuOcaa	Pot isn't really that bad<br>  <br>  but it's illegal and if he gets caught he could get into serious<br>  so i think you should tell him to stop before he gets caught or to be careful<br>  <br>  i think you should let his parents handle the situation though|`|876e05e5fb4225d5d27c03023eb578b5aa	Well from what I've heard and seen from people that have tried pot, it isn't really bad.  I actually heard that it makes you smart.  I am now 20 and never in my life have i ever tried pot.  But, I honestly believe that if you don't want your son to smoke it then you can talk to him about it.  You can ask him what he thinks about it and then tell him what you think about him smoking it.  If he only wants to do it to fit in then just tell him that he shouldn't have to do things that he's not sure of doing just to get people to like him.  But, ya, overall i don't really think it's really all that bad from what I've seen.  It's healthier than your son drinking or smoking ciggs.|`|PuQyYMM8aa	You can involve him in sports or other activities outside of the school. This gets kids to be friends with other kids that they don't see everyday. Keep him busy. Find what activities interest you, and let him join in with you. Maybe you can both join a local YMCA, or take boxing lessons, or maybe play baseball or basketball a couple times a week. There isn't much you can do, as a friend.<br>  <br>  His parents need to become aware of what is going on, and they need to take control of their son. I once had my suspicions about my own son smoking weed. He denied it; saying that he never ever did drugs. I gave him an at home drug test and he passed. However, i warned him that he would be given random tests when i so choosed to. This was about 2 years ago, and my son is now 14yrs old. I have given his several test which he passed them all, but he knows in the back of his mind, that it could happen at any time. I stay very stict with my children and i stay on top of their lives. I have all their passwords for Myspace and Facebook. I check them daily, and they know that. My son says that i know way too much! But, i just tell him that i can never know enough! Also, if my son wants to go to a friends house, i always call the parents first. I want to make sure an adult will be there, and also let the adult know that i am leaving my child in their care. <br>  <br>  The only thing i can really say is to be active in the childs life and try to consume them with fun and exciting activities that will keep them from their "BAD" crowd.|`|u0eTvggDaa	Weed is not a drug of any sort, i smoked when i was 14. Still do!<br>  <br>  it has had no affect on me what so ever, i made A's&B's in school and was on the soccer, and dance team. I am in shape but still smoke. <br>  <br>  Weed is not a drug, it is completely natural.<br>  <br>  we already have THC in our bodies, so it's not like he is hurting his self in anyway, or putting something in his body that isn' already there.<br>  <br>  And smoking weed, is nothing like smoking a cig. yeah it still has tar in it, but if you smoke out of a bong then there is no tar left in the weed, because of the water.<br>  <br>  so let him toke. It's the best method!|`|oHNsAcInaa	You can't do anything for him . You might want to talk to your friend if you have a problem with it. <br>  <br>  The only problem with Pot is that its illegal.
WLtsumGBaa	im 37 weeks and it still has not popped. it is flat tho. it became flate since 5months. its still flat and in 37weeks. my in law had an inny all 3 of her pregnancies. her belly button is a SUPER INNY THO. my belly button is very shallow so it got flat early but never popped. i think it depends on ur belly button type|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Mine never popped, it just went flat lol.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	Mine has not and I don't think it will. My belly button is really deep.  I never thought that it would pop and I glad it didn't|`|s1utniuvaa	Didn't on my first 2... I have a very very deep belly button... I hope it doesn't this time... I have fears it will, I will be bigger than I was with my first 2!|`|v3LnJycKaa	2 pregnancies and it never has... gets some what flat, i dont have a super innie or anything but i also dont get super big...|`|C4ibOR7Laa	im 16 weeks and it hasn't popped all the way out but its turning into an outie|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Mine never did....it just kind of flattened out near the end of my pregnancy.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	funny you ask this... when I was pregnant I told my mom that happens and she laughed at me and told me women are not turkeys out timer doesn't pop when we are ready..lol.. I asked people I worked with and they laughed at me too but my belly button popped out about 8 1/2 mos. then I told my mom .... SEE I am ready now :)|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Mine was level with my stomach at 25 weeks. At about 30 weeks it started to protrude. Now at 35 weeks I have a big outie. But some women's buttons never go anywhere.|`|Io28z8l2aa	mine just flattened out, but i when i went 12 days overdue it pinged out like an oven timer! guess she was ready to come out :)|`|3qI1oyFaaa	I'm 27w4d and mine still hasn't. Not all that close either, I don't think mine ever will.|`|aGxbD6snaa	i think it was in the later 20 early 30 weeks, it went as soon as she was born.|`|3EiOobEVaa	I am  now 29 weeks 6 days and mine still has not popped...I guess its not|`|xarKlp0Oaa	My belly button popped out at my 8th month.|`|jsoSKMEmaa	I think i was around 7 months or maybe a little further gone before it popped! I was a little embarrassing as it showed through clothes so had to put plaster over it! It pooed back in again after the birth!!|`|kVBrt5CZaa	im 20 weeks 3 days with a gorgeous baby boy.. and i noticed last night my belly button isnt as deep as it used to be so im starting to think its gonna pop out soon enough!|`|e5CuEiPfaa	Mine never did! But my sis-in-laws did and she had to wear a bandaid over it or it would show through her clothes!|`|FYDw1rjlaa	mine doesn't pop until I was 33 weeks
RuyLwzA0aa	I would say go now.  There is no point in being miserable when there could be something your dr. could do.  I have sat around for a year with crazy periods, and finally made an appt. for next week.  I don't know why we do this to ourselves!|`|MmQi03oXaa	I would go soon. They can give your meds to bring on AF, but I know of women who never got a positive on a HPT and were actually pregnant. Have them do bloodwork to check for pregnancy, then go from there after you get the results.|`|3EiOobEVaa	I think this week or next week would be a good time to go to the doctor. To me it seems like you have alot of the symptoms of pregnancy. At least if you go they can give you a definite yes or no. Good Luck.
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	In my experience, labor is much more painful once your water breaks.  <br>  <br>  With my first, my water broke before contractions, and they needed to use pitocin to get things moving.  I started out at 0cm, and probably by 1-2cm, I was in constant agonizing pain.  I labored that way for about 9 hours and was still only at 3-4cm, so I got the epidural.  I finally reached 10cm six hours later (but needed a c-section after 2 hours of pushing).<br>  <br>  With my 2nd, I was induced at 37w5d due to pre-eclampsia.  I was at 2cm when I went in.  Even with the pitocin, contractions were very manageable (I talked through most of them), and they were immediately much worse within 30 minutes of them breaking my water.  (I was 3-4cm.)  I panicked that my labor was going to be long and difficult again, and I opted for the epidural at probably 5-6cm.  In hindsight, I wish I hadn't gotten it because my daughter was born 2 hours later, and I could probably have managed the pain for 2 more hours.<br>  <br>  With my 3rd, I was induced again at 37w5d due to pre-eclampsia.  This time, I was already at 3cm and 50% effaced going in.  I made very little progress on the pitocin alone, so they broke my water again, making contractions much worse.  This time, though, I had better pain management techniques along with the help of a doula, and I cruised right along until about 5cm.  Then, I was more tired than anything (I'd barely slept the night before), and I almost got the epidural.  My midwife had me get in the shower instead, and she ran the shower spray over my lower back for 45 minutes.  That helped so much!  Yes, it was still painful, but very, very manageable.  When I got out of the shower, I was dilated to an 8-9, and it wasn't long before I was ready to push (maybe another 15 minutes?).  I never needed the epidural at all, and the birth was amazing.  I really recommend an unmed birth to anyone who asks, and I think being in the shower is what really made a difference for me, too.<br>  <br>  Of course, every woman is different, but it's always a good idea to plan some pain management strategies even if you're planning an epidural just in case you can't get the epidural right away or if it doesn't work for you.|`|Io28z8l2aa	i think it depends on your pain threshhold, whether its natural labour or induced, what drugs you've had/having etc<br>  <br>  but for me, it was 5/6cm. my labour was induced and i went from not much pain to unbearable pain in about an hour. they discovered the drip was too fast and thats why i thought i was going to explode. it took about 3/4 hours after that i think and my baby girl arrived. :)|`|mVD3TQkFaa	I got my epidural at 4cm but it hurt like hell up to that. I had very bad back labor though so if that would have been different I think I could have made it to 6cm without pain relief.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	I was induced and I was on 2cm<br>  <br>  Contractions felt super painful at 6 cm. I didn't get an epidural. About an hour to an hour and a half later my baby girl came out.|`|jsoSKMEmaa	When i went into hospital in labour i was only 1cm and i'd been having pains for around 5 hours. In total i was in labour 40 hours before baby was born and obviously labour pains hurt but to begin with they are bearable. I would say it only became that painful and unbearable right towards the end. Probably the last 2 hours and i'd never of done those without pain relief! However, if i'd of had a quicker labour things may of been different! I may of been able to take it all!!|`|vjK8ZT20aa	Since everyone has a different pain threshold it will vary from person to person.  With my first child I think it became painful @ around 5 cm and she was born about 4 hours later.  My second it didn't get unbearable till 8 cm and she was born within the hour, The third I don't really remember as I was groggy from a sleeping pill but her whole labor and delivery only lasted one and half hours, and the fourth it didn't became painful until about 9.  I asked for medication at 7 though because I knew that I wouldn't be able to have anything if I dilated anymore it would be too late to get anything, by the time they administered it though, I was moments away from pushing.  best of luck, you will do great!|`|aGxbD6snaa	i was 1cm for about 3 weeks and having braxton hicks a lot. when i went into labour i think i was 2/3cm when they checked me it was painful but bearable. then i think when the contractions were really bad i was about 7cm. i had pethedine and gas and air, at the end the contractions were terrible but amazingly i coped even though i could still feel them strongly with pain relief. its all worth it, the contractions are the worst part. but after the birth i found the stitches were more painful than all of it. it hasnt put me off having more so it just shows its different for everyone and your pain tolerence. good luck.|`|d8HwFub8aa	about 6 but it depends on a numer of different things|`|eu6UQElYaa	Depends on the person.  Usually hard labor begins at around 4 cm.   but for some it doesn't begin until 6 cm.  I've even heard of a woman walking into the hospital at 8cms and she JUST started getting bad contractions.    <br>  Personally, I'm sitting here at home dilated to 3 cm, 80% effaced, and in no pain at all with the exception of the very occasional false labor contraction.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	My contractions were extremely painful at 4cm.  That's when i asked for the pain meds.  My daughter was born 4 hours later.
SDjrojZXaa	it is hard imagining two especially when you have a newborn those first couple months are HARD. but once he gets a little older and things start coming more natural you will get a routine that works and makes things easier and then it will probably be more tempting to share your love with another child. As far as being ready or being able to afford another you probably will never think you are prepared for that but once you meet your new one you will move heaven and earth to make it work. I felt the same way as you definately and my son is 10 months and i know im still not ready yet(my husband is) because i just want to enjoy him but i am starting to realize i want to do it again(probably because im forgetting just how hard those first couple months are)I was an only child as well and I also swore i wouldnt do that to my son....but its easy to say one is enough because kids just complete you dont they?|`|M6c0hUefaa	It's a mix up for me.<br>  <br>  I actually loved being pregnant, even though towards the end I had a few problems, but nothing major.<br>  <br>  However, I can't see myself with another child sometimes. I know I would be okay with another, but it being just my daughter for so long, having another would feel so weird. I guess, possibly in a few years, I might want another child, but for now I'm completely content and happy with my only little girl.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I didn't want another until my daughter was about a year old....that's when the baby bug hit.  My daughter is now 6 and she's still an only child.  I'm just not at a point in my life where i can afford more then 1 child.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I want more, but not for a good few years yet.  That gives me time to devote to my son only before getting pregnant again.|`|h85kkDsbaa	I had a long labor and a huge baby, so straight after i said to my husband "one baby is fine for us, i dont want to do that again". But within days i had completely changed my mind, and now my son is 7 months who i loves to bits i couldn't imagine never being pregnant again or being in labor again. So i will differently have another one.|`|7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	I agree with you, i felt exactly the same as you at the time.<br>  <br>  My daughter is almost 8 now, and although i agree with what you say in that i would never have wanted her to be an only child, but i have absolutely never had any interest in having another.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it's something to do with lifestyle. I am divorced now and i wouldn't want to have children with lots of different partners, so perhaps this has quashed my maternal desire.<br>  <br>  hope this answers your poll<br>  x|`|BypjotRpaa	i'm in the same boat... my son just had his 1st on the 19th.*sniffle* ...<br>  the hubby and i talk of add another child when Logan turns 3.<br>  Pregnancy was hard on me, and of coarse the not knowing of how to parent was hard. <br>  and also like you it would be really tight to have another child.<br>  but i'm not shutting out the possibilities ..2 more years and then i will decide.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	I knew I wanted more. I'm pregnant with my third right now, and I want more! :) I've always known I wanted to have a big family though. I don't mind giving my body up for healthy babies. Everyone is different though.|`|MR9iBgafaa	Straight afterwards I didn't want another baby. But I'm already nostalgic and she's only 4.5 months old! We're going to wait till she's at school though as I couldn't take care of 2 babies and give them both the love and care that Olivia gets.|`|T0gv52CDaa	I knew that I never wanted to have an "only child" and I knew that I wanted them to be no more than 2 - 3 years apart so that they would be playmates.  That being said, it was always my dream to have one and adopt two.  I can't convince my husband on adoption, so we have now had two, and that is it for us.  Being pregnant was harder with a two year old running around, but I wouldn't change my decision to have another one.  My first pregnancy was way easier than my 2nd pregnancy was, so after the first, I was definitely ready for another, and started trying to get pregnant again as soon as the first turned one.  If my first pregnancy had been like my 2nd one was, I may have given more thought my thing about not wanting an only child.|`|aGxbD6snaa	my daughter is only 7 weeks and im already thinking about when i want the next one lol. i always wanted a big family with them quite close in age, but i want to enjoy my daughter first. maybe when she gets to about a year old well have another but it dpends what happens between now and then. i was told i couldnt have kids so im so greatful for my baby, i had the best pregnancy and birth i could have asked for and shes the best baby ever so quiet and happy. wait until you are ready for another before rushing and if youre not ready for 10 years theres nothing wrong with that. just enjoy your baby while theyre still young.|`|gC1ITdJUaa	I definitely want another one. We had our first about 4 and a half months ago and my husband and I both want a little girl. I think it would be so amazing to have a 2 or 3 year old son helping out with a tiny little baby. (possibly a 13 month old if I happen to be pregnant now).<br>  <br>  Our only problem is that my husband is in the military and I don't know how well I could handle both when he deploys about a year and a half from now. That and our son is the light of our lives and I couldn't imagine loving another baby as much as I love him.|`|pOjcj2ljaa	My daughter is almost 3, when I first had her, my mind was made up that I wanted no other children, she was the first and only. Once she got around 20 months I wanted another one. I can't afford any more children right now, so it's not happening yet. But I definitely did not want more right away. Give it time, if another baby is meant for you and your husband, it'll happen. Don't stress right now, enjoy your new baby!|`|XvePaWWXaa	5 weeks after my son was born, I was baby hungry again and we both agreed we would like him to have a sibling. But now the reality of life has set in and I don't think I'll have another. My husband doesn't help, I'm basically a single mom and it sucks. Our relationship is strained and I'm burned out. It kills me to think that he'll be my only child and he won't have any brothers or sisters to play and grow up with. But that's life I guess, I need to be realistic about it.|`|C1629HwFaa	Like you i was the very same, but i fell pregnant again when my first child was 6months and it was a big big shock, but now when i look at the two of them playing together it's brilliant i would'nt have wanted it any other way. They're the best of friends. So dont worry it will work out. Good luck|`|zeL5DJG3aa	i have one child.  my pg sucked.  the labor sucked.  ended up with a c-section that sucked big time.  i love my son with all my heart but i know that another child is not for us.  if there was an oops, we would be happy of course but as far as planning for another child - nope.  we can't afford it either.|`|5udXQ79Laa	I agree with you.  At this point with my son being 10 months, I can't imagine having more.  He requires so much attention, I feel if I have another one someone is going to be neglected, either my first son, my new baby, my husband or myself.|`|e5CuEiPfaa	I always wanted 2 kids. My daughter is now 3 and to tell you truthfully, you just kind of forget along the way how rough pregnancy can be! But I really want a playmate for my daughter, so I guess I will go through it again!|`|z6IekuwSaa	Before I had my baby girl I said I wanted 5 kids. I still love kids.

I have a 5 month old and we plan to have 3 more. I don't think affordability comes into it as the poorest people sometimes have the happiest kids. You will cope. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about more kids now, we're planning on waiting a few years. Some people get broody again when their baby gets older. Not every pregnancy is the same either but if it's not for you then I'm sure you'll love the one you have:-)|`|HCg0YZfXaa	after i gave birth to my daughter i didn't want anymore kids, in which at first i didn't realize i was also going through postpartum depression which really sucks. (i dealt with the depression for almost like 6-8 months it was very bad) once i snapped out of that and my daughter got older i realized that i did want more kids. however, i didn't want them right then and there. give it a little time until your son gets bigger like about a yr before you really make a decision about it. what you may feel now you may change your mind about when your son is about and stuff. hope this was somewhat helpful to you.|`|lKsIKKm2aa	I have a 5 1/2 month old and a 2 1/2 year old... Both beautiful little boys! It's really all about routine... Sure I get stressed out sometimes but it is soo worth it and as soon as my 5mo old is a little over a year and a half we are going to try for a baby girl. But oh man if I end up with three boys!!! Ahhh!! Jk.. My husband helps out tremendously when he gets home from work and on the weekends so it really is a lot less stress on me and I'm looking forward to when my little one is walking and they can actually PLAY together.. Don't you want that for your child? A permanent playdate?:) I understand your baby is very very young so your feelings about everything could change down the road.. And babies are expensive but heck, at my baby showers I got everything I needed except for a swing, then now I just have to but diapers wipes and as his clothes from his big brother were barely used and still in good shape. And I didn't sell any of his toys or anything ( just the swing) I couldn't imagine just having 1 child... But everyones different.|`|G2auAv1Saa	I always thought I would just have one. <br>  (I had 7 other siblings and hated having that many, exact opposite of you- we all wanted what we didn't have lol)<br>  When my daughter turned 4 I just cried because she was so big and independent and the whole baby period just went too fast and I started wanting a baby again. So my husband and I decided to try for a month and see what happened- 3 weeks later we were pregnant! I'm about to have my little boy now and I am happy. The pregnancy is harder because I also have my daughter to take care, the biggest problem I have had is tripping over her because I can't see her beneath my belly.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I always wanted 2.  I have a little boy now, 9 months old.   My husband and I agreed after we had him, that was it...we were just going to have the one. (I had a difficult pregnancy and then complications led to emergency section at 36 weeks)  Then recently, about 3 months ago, we had a pregnancy scare, and now we've both agreed that we'll try for another one in about a year.  After the second, we'll stop.
z6IekuwSaa	I have this problem from time to time. I usually load my nips down with Lanolin before I pump so it's like a lubricant. It usually only lasts 2-3 days and then the pain goes away. Since you are an experienced pumper I'm assuming it's not thrush, dry nips, or plugged ducts.|`|GJgZVKvXaa	The change and stress of returning to work may be to blame.  You may not be as relaxed pumping at work, and your letdown may be slowed which is then causing painful friction.  <br>  <br>  Try deep breathing, looking at a photo of your baby, or cuddling with one of his blankets while you pump.  <br>  <br>  You can also try lubricating your nipples before you start to pump, as others have mentioned.  Lansinoh is great but you can also just use plain water, it will be less likely to gum up your pump parts.|`|deIzFnV8aa	CHeck for plugged ducts; they can happen at any time.  THey feel like a little hot lump in your breast, or if the pain is always in one area. It may not hurt as much during nursing if baby doesn't stimulate that area.  Hot compresses can help any type of pain.  And having baby nurse with his chin opposite the sore area can help if plugged ducts are the problem.|`|33O7ZTRRaa	I have had the same problem happen every so often for me as well.  Sometimes mine is worse after my son has fed vigorously during the night or before leaving for the daycare in the morning.<br>  My suggestion is to use Lanolin cream.  That has been my lifesaver from the very start of breastfeeding.  I had a problem with rubbing on the flanges when  would pump, so I too now use the largest (30.5mm) flanges.  When I originally had this problem, I spoke with a lactation consultant, and she had suggested that I try putting breast/nipple at a different angle when I pump.  She said that when we breastfeed, the nipple isn't in the same position every time, but when pumping women tend to think that there is a specific way they have to position their breast.  She said just find a position that is comfortable for you.<br>  It will get better.  My baby is 8 weeks old, and I went back to work when he was 6 weeks. I pump 3-4 times while I'm at work, and on a few days it has been really painful.  However, after I nurse him when I get home it seems to get better.  I think this is because a pump isn't as effective at completely emptying the breast like a  baby does.  So I think during the day when we pump, there is still milk left over that isn't getting expressed out during the pumping sessions.<br>  If things don't get better for you, call a lactation consultant and they should be able to give you some tips.  Good luck!|`|UghJ0XROaa	I have days where for some reason my nipples hurt horribly while pumping. Before you pump and after you are done, but on the Lansinoh nipple cream or whichever you happen to use. That helps me.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	Was it the same pump you used before? Perhaps you should try to change pumps.
bLXqYUYWaa	This is kinda weird but I used to have this problem when I was a child. I still remember it. I used to sleepwalk and I would like see people but It might have just been a dream. But one night I woke up because I heard a knock at the door and I saw a guy so I got freaked out because it was 3 am. and I woke my parents up and he was gone my mom said it was a nightmare but I know what I saw and I remember walking up to the window and everything!

When a dream catcher is hung above the place where you sleep it moves freely in the night air and catches the dreams as they drift by. The good dreams, knowing their way, pass through the opening in the center of the webbing while the bad dreams, not knowing the way, are caught in the webbing and destroyed at the first light of the morning sun.<br>  <br>  There are many variants to the dream catcher legend, some which say both the good and bad dreams are captured and some which say the good dreams slide down the feather to those sleeping below. Although the Ojibwa are credited as the first people to use Dream Catchers many other Tribes and Native peoples have adopted Dream Catchers into their culture. Even though the designs and legends of Dream Catchers differ slightly, the underlying meaning and symbolism is universal and is carried across cultures and language barriers.<br>  <br>  Everybody dreams.|`|bd499f5017ffc8776de9bfd98e2a4ef1aa	maybe something traumatizing happend to her. for example: molesting, gory/scary movie, encounter with a ghost, or even imaginary monsters.<br>  <br>  teach her how to talk. the sooner she can communicate with you, the sooner you'll know for sure.<br>  <br>  good luck

That in and of itself is not even a little bit strange. What makes it so weird is that I seriously, seriously ~HATE~ orange-flavored things!!<br>  <br>  Ironically, it lasted for the entire second half of my pregnancy.

Before I got pregnant I hated McDonald's.  Then in the first weeks of pregnancy I started to crave McDonald's.  I even had a dream where I won a few million in the lottery and the first thing I did with the money was go to McDonald's and buy everything on the menu and then sat down to eat it all.   I woke up with the happiest feeling and that's when I really knew that something funny was going on.|`|s1utniuvaa	Strawberry laces... you know the really thin really long licorice laces...

5N3odm3Qaa	Consider having an abortion to save your future and your relationship with your family. It will cost about $450 and will only hurt about as much as bad period cramps. You get on with your life the next day. There are no medically supported links to breast cancer risks or infertility. It is actually considerably safer than having an IUD placed or giving birth naturally. The cost just to give birth is about $2000 with good insurance coverage. Then the expenses skyrocket. So consider your options, weigh everything carefully, and go to PlannedParenthood.com for some information.<br>  <br>  Don't be swayed by pro-lifers who try to make you blindly believe that abortions put the mother at risk for breast cancer or the inability to conceive in the future. The top medical institutions and medical journals have addressed these fables with no shortage of very rigorous studies, all of which unanimously dispel the pro-life BS.|`|uuHPneEcaa	well hun.. i am sorry u have to go threw this like u have too.. my family is the same way but I am 21 yrs old and he is 23 yrs old. (don't ask). U have to tell them  I know ur scared but u have to do what u have to do. Does ur family like ur boyfriend? They could have him charged with statuary rape. and yes he will go to jail. even though u consented to it. <br>  <br>  u can't keep this from ur family u just have to tell them, ur not a whore. just a lil fast for ur age. (not trying to sound mean or anything) it happens. just prove to them that u and ur boyfriend are going to take care of ur child by u both getting a job. and other things to make them see that ur responsible. <br>  <br>  once again i am sorry u have to go threw this.|`|wPtjtLycaa	next time swallow|`|GpR5MI5raa	i was in a similar situation when I was 16 and i know its no fun. Think long and hard about whether or not you should keep the baby. Consider if your boyfriend will stay with you and if you can financially take care of a baby. If you have an abortion, your family doesn't even need to know about it. Planned parenthood can help you. But if you keep the baby, your family may surprise you by their reaction. They certainly wont be happy, but they may end up giving you support that you never expected them to. <br>  <br>  Good Luck. I hope everything works out the way that is best for everybody. And I just want you to know that I know EXACTLY how you feel, but your choice is your own.|`|90zcKChJaa	Put you kid up for adoption, that way the child will have a loving environment and parents that are suitable to care for it.|`|NroZQN5vaa	Consider an open adoption. Depending on your state, the age of consent might be 16 so they might not be able to throw the boy in jail.|`|AiwapbAyaa	awww...i realy feel for you!... :-( Um well since you are about to have a baby you can get emacipated! so look into that....i think there are certain organizations that will help you out with getting a job and an apartment for you and ur baby! um and i feel you on the 18 year old father thing...of course you want him to help and not go to jail but call a planned pregnancy hot line and asked them if they know any options that you can have....i would give you the number but i lost it....look it up on google k?...GOOD LUCK! I realy want to help you! Im 19 so im not that much older than you and im 7 weeks pregnant and my family dont know yet and they are mos def gonna trip but my boyfriend/baby's father is the navy! but let me know what happend ok! you want e-mail me at Prettyladii19@yahoo.com I will be praying for you k? =D all will be well just dont stress and worry too much!|`|HDS3IGj1aa	continue on with your pregnancy like normal. I know it may be hard without the support  of your family being that you are so young. Once you get further along in your pregnancy and you find out the sex, your family will come around. Just wait until your little bundle of joy gets here.  Good luck and Congratulations. I wish you all the best.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I got pregnant at 15 and had the same issues that you are.

Best of luck.|`|ahDUOe48aa	theyll get over it i thought mine would kill me im 17 he is 25 the will get over it.
eV5E9MhUaa	Sounds normal to me.|`|zwctZ812aa	Yes, that's fine.  Your son must just be a very efficient eater! My son has been like that since birth.  He has never nursed longer than ten minutes, and usually averages about 5-6, but he is 4 months and weighs 15 1/2 lbs, so he's gaining weight great .  As long as he is active, having wet diapers, and growing at a steady rate, don't worry about how long it takes him to eat.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	if he is doing all of those things and doesn't act hungry, then its fine..<br>  <br>  you may have a faster release then other women so your milk comes out faster making him not have to nurse as long.<br>  <br>  i wouldn't worry as long as he seems happy.|`|z6IekuwSaa	Very normal. It means he got the hang of breastfeeding and has become a master! lol. He's prolly getting the same amount just more effeciently. you can always weigh him before and after a feeding to see how many ounces he's takin in|`|GJgZVKvXaa	It sounds like he is a power nurser :)  As long as he is gaining weight and making 6-8 wet diapers and regular bowel movements, he is fine.  Don't worry!|`|MhyuXBoEaa	yeah this is ok as long as he is gaining weight it is fine.|`|ilSzKDxKaa	If you're breastfeeding, as long as the baby is thriving, gaining, wetting and soiling his diapers then he is OK. My baby fed for max 12 minutes and that was a long feed - usually he was only about 7 minutes. Yes I times it because I was worried too but the doc said he was an "efficient" feeder so no dilly dallying about, he just got in there, ate and then that was that!|`|LoUCVWRraa	yep. thats fine! as long as he is eating :) and some babies at that age eat every 4-5 hours even so even though hes not eating for as long, he is eating pretty often, and even if he wasnt, 8 minutes is fine :)
dFHsAXDMaa	OMG as a nurse and mother of for kids yu are blessed....... I have such wicked morning sickness with two kids and none with the other two at all.... I was like you just needed to pee all the time and ate for two definitely.... have you been to doctors for check up yet... I would recommend you go because prenatal care is very important... and so are prenatal vitamins.... Good luck have a wonderful pregnancy and in about 8 months you will have a healthy wonderful little person to love ... my kids are now two girls 17 and 15and two boys 14 and 11. and I can tell you as a mom i wish I could make them small again..The times goes by too quickly and  you need to enjoy each moment.... listen to their little kid stories... spend time playing with them.....going to sporting games, coloring school plays and concerts... because at about13 when they no longer wanna cuddle and watch a movie you will be sad if you missed any of that. I never did miss it and I am glad we have all those memories.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Every woman is different.  Many have morning sickness right from week 4 on until week 12.  Some have it longer.  Some don't get it until a little later like week 8.  Some don't get it at all.   You sound like you are experiencing normal pregnancy symptoms but you are just blessed not to have the morning sickness (at least not yet).   ENJOY IT.  Morning sickness is awful.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I didn't get sick until around 7 weeks, and it only lasted until I was 11 weeks. Everyone's different. I was also tired a lot in my first trimester.|`|NCa8bOjSaa	I wasn't sick, I didn't use the bathroom any more frequently than I had before...the only thing that happened was that I found I was hungry but couldn't eat my normal portions at mealtimes anymore.  I'd feel hungry, but full.  I started to have to eat little bits during the day to make up for it.  Sometimes I'd have two dinners...my regular one, and then whatever I had left over in an hour!<br>  <br>  Don't worry if you're not having many symptoms.  I'm 15 weeks now and still don't have morning sickness.  You are just one of us lucky ones!  Congratulations!|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Every women is different and every pregnancy is different.  At the 6-8 mark some women have horrible morning sickness, others don't. <br>  Your baby is fine.  I didn't have morning sickness with either of my pregnancies.  The only symptom I had was being a little sleepy. <br>  Calm down hun :)|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I never had any type of sickness. My first trimester I was just really tired and was munching all the time. I would just consider yourself lucky! My sister is 5 months and still has sickness!|`|61wXpXVxaa	When your pregnant it feels as it should for you. When your around the 6-8 week mark you may have many symptoms that are expected that you can google or you may not. Your baby is healthy and it will not be affected by your illness as long as you are supplying it with the appropriate hydration and nutrition.
fMilDRgLaa	Is the child ready to be potty trained?  Are you going with what "everyone"  thinks is the normal age a child should be potty trained? Have you tried the stickers, rewards, cheerios, make bubbles, running around naked, and everything else under the sun and  still are having problems?<br>  <br>  If you have not, then some of the other suggestions are good, however if none of this has worked.....your child will do it when they are ready. I have learned from experience.  <br>  <br>  The best advice I have  while training is if there is an accident, do not get upset with them, do not raise your voice or punish them.  Praise them TONS when they do it.  Just relax, when I finally accepted my three year old son was not ready....and stopped preaching to him...he did it in less then a month. I think my biggest mistake is getting upset with him and raising my voice.  I am getting ready for son #2 and I will not make that mistake. Good luck!|`|HCg0YZfXaa	it was difficult with my daughter at first. i used rewards and a reward chart. every time she went potty in her potty or the big potty she got to pick a sticker to put on her reward chart. if she went pee she got sticker if she went poop she got 2 stickers. another thing that you can try is a set time, like having her sit on the potty every 20-25 minutes for a few minutes and if he/she doesn't go potty that is ok, just make sure that when the child does go to make a big deal about it like clap for him/her and say "yea! "sam" you did it you went to the potty i am so proud of you" and one last idea is to show your child the potty isn't scary use a teddy bear, doll, action figure pretend that their favorite thing has to go potty it may help. if that doesn't help try a movie for potty training like "elmo goes potty" or something like that you'd be surprised how much they help. i really hope also info has helped you.|`|R9mQNOCnaa	No duct tape or Cheerios needed.First question,is this a boy or girl and how old?18months is usually a good time to start introducing them to potty training.The best thing is to get their own potty to put in the bathroom next to your so it's there when their ready.Use pull ups in the house and encourage the to use the big potty and no more diapers.Make it fun by praising them when they get it and don't punish them for making a mistake,they're learning.Don't wait when they have to go.Keep the diapers on at night until they learn,or get out of the crib.Don't rush it.Kids learn at their own pace.It should not be used as a bribe to do something they want to do.If they have to go they'll let you know.Good luck.|`|cXAzfS46aa	Duct-Tape!!! <br>  <br>  Just dont let him/her do "big boy/girl things", like go outside or playgames until they go to the bathroom|`|1JsWMX0daa	positive reinforcement. a nice treat upon good progress!|`|kyQPY0LTaa	my oldest child (now 4) was potty trained by her 2nd birthday. If your child knows of any kids that are already potty trained than thats the best. My daughter has an aunt that is close in age with her and she liked the fact that her aunt got to wear pretty panties with her favorite characters on them. Buy some panties whether for a boy or girl in your childs favorite characters and what not and tell him/her that when they can go to the potty all the time they get to wear those awesome special underwear. It worked for me. I hope its just as easy for my second|`|KBirCZGFaa	I am glad you asked, I have a GREAT suggestion for you. I just potty-trained my little boy who is 25 months old. I did the training on Feb. 11th at 8:30 a.m. His last accident of the day was at 11:00 am, and by that time, he was going to the potty all by himself when he felt the urge, pulling down his own pants, peeing in the little potty, pulling up his own pants, dumping his urin in the toilet flushing the toilet, and returning the potty bowl to the potty chair. All on his own! He had two more accidents over the next 3 days. Potty Training was on Wed, and his last accidnent was Saturday. It has now been 2 weeks, and he has kept his pants dry in his big boy underwear. I don't even have to remind him! I just sit and read a magazine while he takes care of his own business!<br>  <br>  Do you want to know how this is possible? Get this book: "Toilet-Training in Less Than a Day." I checked it out at the library, read it carefully, took notes, and followed it as closely as I could. All of my friends scoffed, but they were wrong! It worked! <br>  <br>  Overall, the process was exahusting for me because I was giving constant praise and instruction for 4-6 hours. But my son loved it! He got constant attention from his mom, and special treats and drinks. He thought it was a game, and had a lot of fun. <br>  <br>  The reason a lot of moms don't do this is because (a) they haven't heard of it - the potty-traning trend lately is to nearly let kids teach themselves OR (b) it takes too much preperation. To be prepared, you have to read the book carefully, you need to have half-a-day for just this. There should be no other kids around or distractions like toys or TV. It's best to even have snacks and lunch prepared ahead of time. Not every mom can do this, but I could because I stay home and have no other kids. OR (c) if you have tried another method, and the child has experienced failure, this method might not work so well.<br>  <br>  So, how does it work? <br>  I am not going to tell you because I can't write that much here! It's a 100 page book, and if you try to cut corner or wing it from what I say, it won't be done right. But, to give you an idea, it a lot of verbal instruction, manual guidanc with your hands on the child's to help him along, constant praise from the moment the child begins following instruction, special treats for rewards. The doctors who developed the program, used what they know about accelerating the learning process: Learningi s best done with not distractions or interruptions. Learning is best understood through teaching (the child teaches a doll first). Learning is quickly accomplished through lots of practice in a small window of time.<br>  <br>  This was an effective way of potty-training. It was 100% positive and fun for my son. I tell everyone I know.|`|xbzCxo8yaa	Children learn by example...........make a game out of it..........give a reward afterwards.....................<br>  <br>  I used to act like I was talking on the phone and say what a big boy my Isaiah was and how when he sat on the potty everybody was happy and going to clap....<br>  <br>  Good luck
h57t7FAjaa	I love the name Reece!  I think its also nice spelled Reese or Rhys (my favorite and looks less like the candy :P)<br>  <br>  Reece Jerome however doesn't have the greatest flow, but maybe when added with the last name it's better?  however considering where the name comes from and its sentimental value I think the sound does not overly matter.<br>  <br>  But congratulations on you little boy, and good luck! <br>  If Reece Jerome is what you love, then that's all that matters :)|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I really like the name Reece and i think it sounds fine with Jerome as the middle name.|`|lYjweuZmaa	I DO NOT LIKE THAT NAME AT ALL!!!

0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	First of all, I'm thinking that some of the answerers here don't actually know what agnostic means...  <br>  <br>  What is right for your children is what *you* and your child's father feel is right for your children.  Your parents and his parents had the opportunity to do what they thought was right, faith-wise, for their children.  And, you both came to adulthood with the ideas & faith that you currently have.  You may grow & change over the years.  Your ideas & faith may change as you experience more in the world, but you can only make the decision with the information and plans you have now.  <br>  <br>  And, you have to own whatever decision you make for yourselves - whether you make that decision to please his parents or not.  <br>  <br>  So, choose wisely.  What ideas do you want to present to your children regarding spiritual beliefs?  <br>  <br>  As an agnostic, who wants to raise her children going to a church and who believes that morals and values are not seated in any particular religious belief system, you may want to check into your local Unitarian Universalist church.  UU's do not adhere to any set of religious dogma, instead we encourage each member to find their own spiritual truth (even the children) drawing inspiration from every source available, religious, philosophical and more.  The only thing we all agree on are our principles for living in the world - social justice, the inherent worth & dignity of all persons, our interdependence on the web of life around us, etc...  Check it out here: <a href="http://www.uua.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.uua.org/</a>|`|eu6UQElYaa	It's not right that they are going to judge you just based on your religious beliefs, but people do that.  You can't change them so my suggestion is to change your perception of it.  In other words, make up your mind to not give a damn about what they think.  Besides, what's the problem anyways.  You already agreed to let the child go to his church.  The child will be raised going to a church so that should appease them.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Well, here's my opinion:  You said "his family" devote Catholics & Episcopalian - I wonder if they "practice" their faith.  Meaning:  go to church and holy days, etc.  If not, they're not devote.<br>  <br>  You say, you're "agnostic".  If you have NEVER BEEN EXPOSED TO ANY RELIGION then you're eyes are not open and how can you make that statement (agnostic)?<br>  <br>  You and your bf SHOULD HAVE thought and talked about religion before conceiving - now a problem.  <br>  <br>  I don't get it....you're a agnostic and his family is the other faiths and you want the child to be OPEN TO ALL RELIGIONS.  That statement does not make sense - you don't have one so what can you teach the child?<br>  <br>  FYI - should you both baptize your child in the Catholic faith; you must follow all rules and adhere to them.  Doesn't seem likely the both of you will adhere to Catholic values.  So, I suggest your baptize the child in the Episcopalian faith !  When the child turns 18 yrs old then he/she can decide what faith if any they want!<br>  <br>  Problem solved!|`|vue9NOhYaa	I think this is a decision you and your boyfriend need to make ... and ideally should have made before you decided to have a child together.  Any time you have two parents with two very different religious beliefs, it can, of course, cause difficulties.<br>  <br>  IMO, you need to pick a religion (or no religion)  for your child and stick with it.  You can't teach a child to be 'agnostic and Catholic' ... because those are two completely different belief systems. You CAN teach a child to be Catholic (or agnostic) and respect that OTHER people may choose to be agnostic (or Catholic) ... but that his religion is the right one for HIM. And yes, when he grows up, he may make  a different choice for himself.<br>  <br>  (I am in a mixed marriage. I'm Jewish, my husband was raised Baptist, but doesn't now follow any organized religion.  When I agreed to marry, HE agreed that children would be raised Jewish.  So, we have a Jewish home.  Child and I go to synagogue, and in our home we celebrate Jewish holidays.  Daddy doesn't go to synagogue (expect for a few special events, like daughter's Bat Mitzvah), and participates in home celebrations.  It works for us.)|`|MhyuXBoEaa	The best religion for your baby is whatever you feel is right not what someone tells you is right.  If you and your boyfriend choose to raise the baby catholic then that is your choice same goes for the baptist. Shouldn't matter to anyone else but you and the father.. the baby is what is important not what church he should go to .|`|aQQ4uQhdaa	Make sure he/she understands the value of having a personal relationship with God at a young age. episcopalian is kinda different then what catholics and baptist believe. i would not recommend your child going to that one. but catholics and baptist almost believe the same thing except for some of the rituals Catholics do. like lint. <br>  i personally go to a baptist church and so does my baby.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Yes, welcome to the world of being a "non-believer."<br>  <br>  To be honest, you will just have to sit down and make sure you and your bf are on the same page...no one else's opinion matters.  Trust me, I've had my fair share of ignorant comments come out of family member's mouths regarding religion or lack there of...you can't make everyone understand or tolerate what they don't believe (would be nice...but it doesn't always happen.)  <br>  <br>  It is you and your bf's child.  Not MIL or whoever else.  You and your bf get final say.  End of story.|`|UdtzY5ciaa	These things really should be sorted BEFORE the baby stage.   I suspect this problem will end up getting pretty bad if they really feel that way.<br>  <br>  Edit: Amber B,  Please don't say "THEY KNOW."  They don't know.  They believe.  Anyone who pretends otherwise is delusional.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Honestly what i would do is just explain to the child when he/she is old enough to understand these things that there are other beliefs and other religions and that she can have her own choice as to what she believes.|`|8nPXjFlPaa	I thought the way my mum did it was exellent. D'you know, I didn't even realise my mum believed in god until I was 13?<br>  <br>  Everytime I asked questions, she'd answer as simply as possible, (baring in mind I was v young when I started asking) and then when difficult questions came into play she was just really honest and said...well, Some people believe this, some people believe that (she didn't say this and that, she told the story!) But then she simply said, I was to make up my own mind, but follow what felt right in my heart. <br>  And you can't do better than that by yourself can you?<br>  <br>  Or can you? Let me know! lol|`|F8iyUqJBaa	It's not about religion or denominations.  It's about a faith in the one true God.  The God of the bible, and a belief that Jesus is the Son of God.  For you to say that you don't believe in that is hard for them to respect as you desire, because they know what is going to happen after this life.  To allow your child to be open to all religions is to allow your child to be open to deception and pain.  <br>  I know you are probably rejecting this as you read it.  The bible makes it perfectly clear that Satan has blinded the eyes of the unbeliever and has made the things of God seem foolish to the eyes of man.  I pray that you are able to look past any anger or hurt you experienced in the church and look to the Creator, perhaps go to a non denominational church for a little while and see if you can understand what I'm saying|`|ddP3klT3aa	That is up to YOU. Not your family or his family. If they have a problem with it, oh well. You are not being a bad parent. You and your husband really should discuss this. I don't think infants have any business going to church. I mean, they have NO idea what is going on. Unless people just take them along because they have no one to watch them. I think children should go when they can understand it. I would never force religion on my child. If my child really did not want to go to church I would not make him. I think religion is a personal choice. I think children should also be able to choose. As they get older they will be open to other religions and cultures, and should make their own choice.<br>  My husband's family are free will baptists (whatever that means). They keep telling my husband that they want our son to go to church when he gets older. That bothers me that they keep repeating it..we will cross that bridge when we get there. He is too young to understand. And I think that is a choice that should be left to him. Expose your children to religion and let them make the choice. They have PLENTY of time to change their minds when they get older.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	If one of his parents is catholic and one is episcopalian, one would think they have figured out that parents can work it out if they have different religions.  <br>  <br>  No one is going to be able to tell you what's best; this is a question that you and your boyfriend just have to come to agreement on.  But your inlaws really should have nothing to do with it.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Expose your baby to both and allow him to decide when he reaches an age of understanding.  <br>  <br>  I'm a Christian and I don't agree with the agnostic way of thinking, but I will accept the person and love them as God has called me to.<br>  <br>  But honestly, this would not have been a problem if you and your boyfriend were not unequally yolked in your beliefs.  It's very important for the parents of a child to have the same beliefs and values as to not confuse their child as they grow up.  Christians are to be yolked with Christians and non-believers are to be yolked with non-believers, just as Muslims are to yolked with Muslims and so forth.
bd499f5017ffc8776de9bfd98e2a4ef1aa	he needs discipline. just a little pinch in the arm or some kind little sting. do the time outs.<br>  <br>  your the parent, not the babysitter. be the boss.|`|BypjotRpaa	hope this helps ..it a discipline tool for parents. its very helpful|`|OXSOch9Oaa	Just ignore him.  Go about your daily business and he'll get the idea eventually.  When he calms down make sure you talk to him about why he was having a fit and maybe things will be better, but give him time to come around first.  I don't believe spanking him or time out in the case would work.  Children need to learn they can't push your limits, and this is just their way of testing their independence.  We've all been there, so hang in there.|`|xbzCxo8yaa	Ignore him and when he calms down explain in his terms, why u made the decision you made........if you let it go, I can assure you, it'll only get worse|`|I5pUxwPbaa	the method that seems to work best is when they have a tantrum put them in a 'time out' corner somewhere. this must be a place that is not normally used for fun like in a spare room or in the hall etc. whenever he starts to throw a fit, tell him that if he doesnt stop he will go to the time out place. if he continues take his hand calmly and put him there and tell him to stay until he stops the tantrum. he will undoubtedly try to leave but calmly take him back without saying a word. when he is there for the specific amount of time you give him (like start with a couple minutes) and he is calmer then tell him  he can come back and try to behave. make sure to explain to him why u are doing this and dont yell or get out of control. if he tries to make noise or get your attention from his time out spot dont respond to him or talk to him. this has worked for my sister and her kids and I have watched those nanny shows on tv and it always works great. most important is not to give in when he screams for his way, eventualy he wil realize he never gets his way and will stop.<br>  give it time though, nothing is easy :)  good luck|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	Boy, I wish I could help! I think if I had that answer I would be very rich! My son is 3 1/2 and still throws fits (although they are a little less intense, and infrequent now).<br>  i think There are 2 approaches. The first would be to ignore it and just walk away. He will figure it out eventually that his fits don't bother you, and he won't get his way. The other approach is to put him in time out, or in his bed until he calms down. He will not like that, but it will show him that we do not throw fits. This is the approach I take simply because our house has a VERY open floor plan, and I would have to go outside or in my bedroom to just walk away from it.<br>  You are not alone, and it does get better. It just takes patience! Good Luck!|`|ieJeTiuqaa	This Is a typical child thing. Any age. It's called a little tough love. He's use to getting his way. So when he doesn't he throws fits. Most parents don't like to see their kids cry. But it takes tough love and might even take some time, so the kid knows NO MEANS NO. lol. Some disciplinary actions help to.|`|1JsWMX0daa	that's why you really can not raise a kid without spanking them. there is nothing wrong with a stong slap on the butt or hand. if you think you are gonna verbally rationalize with a little child than you are going to be disappointed. say no once or twice than get tough if you have too. YOU should be in control & it's YOUR kid!|`|tnOZ49JQaa	Oh, gosh it's the terrible two's welcome to it. He will grow out of it. I have a 24 month old and a 3 1/2 year old. My 3 1/2 year old grew out of it as soon as he turned 3. Then my youngest turned two here we go again.|`|a76728313dc8f0da3cb0cd4227b335beaa	After you have ignored him, done the time out thing and so on, if the noise gets to you then get some ear plugs.  They help drown out the sound of those ear pierce shrieks!|`|rVFuRc6Vaa	providing hes safe go to another room and leeve door on jar to watch him to make sure hes ok if he sees you arnt reacting hell gradually get over his tantrem
uFrqC4Y2aa	There's no pill she can take now. You can only take one up to 3 days after. She would have gotten a positiveresult by now. Have her take a test today. The test measures HcG, a pregnancy hormone. HcG doubles every 72 hours so since it's been 3 days since you last tested you may get a positive result. If it's negative there's less chance she could be pregnant so that should calm you down.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	She could be pregnant.  Anytime you have sex, you risk pregnancy.  You didn't mention if the sex was protected or not, and that plays a part. <br>  There is no pill to take, it's far too late.  She should take another test.  If it is still negative and she doesn't get her period in another week, she should go see her Dr to make sure there aren't any medical issues.|`|QSmvZ6fMaa	if you dont want it then you can either do two things <br>    1) get a abortions<br>    2) you have it and give it up for adoption<br>   if you didnt want the baby you should of wrapped it up and then what happens is that a new life comes into this world and then you dont know what to do so what you do is wrap it up and stay safe. you know that if you have a abortion you are killing GOD'S child|`|65RZ441Zaa	WEAR A CONDOM! USE BIRTH CONTROL, DON'T HAVE SEX, these are thing that you do when you don't want a baby.  if you had sex she could be pregnant 50-50 chance. wait for her next period, home pregnancy test are only accurate until  a week before her missed period. look for a test call first response. Chances are that if she got pregnant 2 days before her period, she would of had it anyway.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	There is always a possability of pregnancy when you have unprotected sex. No there isn't a pill that you can take after the fat. It is too early for a prgnancy test to show up so I would just waite and see what happens.|`|n7NgsKxlaa	well, theres a morning after pill. sometimes her period can be late|`|GlFNeRTdaa	the dates dont add up, she couldnt be pregnant going by when u had sex!!!!<br>  <br>  the ovulating date (when she can get pregnant) is right inbetween 2 periods, so hers would of been around the 3rd.<br>  <br>  shes prob just worrying 2 much and thats causing her period to stop.|`|61wXpXVxaa	Your girlfriend may still be pregnant she can see her doctor and they can discuss options with the baby if she is pregnant that will suit the three of you possibly.|`|JIHx8ZDBaa	No pills to take now- it's too late for the day-after pill. Still alittle early for test to be positive- wait a few more days.<br>  <br>  (buy an engagement ring just in case)|`|s5C861QLaa	i wish, guys like us need a pill like that u no
NCa8bOjSaa	I think you are a troll but I will answer this anyway, in case that girl you got pregnant really does exist.<br>  <br>  Tell her you aren't going to marry her.  It's not fair to her if you don't love her.  But obviously you know what happens when you have sex, regardless of if it's "very very good" or not, so STOP DOING IT UNTIL YOU LOVE SOMEONE ENOUGH TO MARRY THEM!!<br>  <br>  You are still required to pay child support though, regardless of if you already have to pay child support to ANOTHER child.<br>  <br>  You seem to act and leave heartbreak and misery in your wake, don't you?|`|gRtmFa1maa	You don't have to marry anyone. Just because you get someone pregnant doesn't mean you have to marry them.<br>  <br>  You will have to pay child support though...married or not. Too late now on that one unless you can proove the child is not yours. (get a DNA test after the child is born)<br>  <br>  So I would suggest if you want to keep having sex but have no means to support your  children, wear a condom or get a vasectomy.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Dont marry her if you dont want to.|`|28fNd725aa	Are you serious.... Well if so, If you really don't love her then definitly don't marry her... that would be the worst thing you can do.  I would be honest with her, will prolly hurt her, but best to be honest from the start then to start building  a life with someone on a lie.. that will hurt worse in the end!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|GxlkhRfoaa	LOL they make these things called condoms.  And especially someone who already has a child should know what they are.  I guess since you dont love her and were only with her for the sex then you will have another child support bill to pay.  Maybe after two children you will learn a lesson??|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	If you don't love her then don't get married. Tell her the truth, that you're not ready to get married. She's going to be PISSED, but it's better to be honest about stuff like that than to get married and be unhappy.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	Well, you don't marry someone that you got pregnant. If you don't love her then move on but you will be paying child support for two. Next use protection if you plan on using someone.|`|3ec4cbb91f437e577799d2a0c5e59b3caa	You'll have to have an adult conversation with your girlfriend and see what she wants to do, you don't have to marry her.<br>  <br>  If you feel that you can't say you don't love her then tell her that marriage isn't the best option right now and shouldn't be rushed into, who knows you might change your mind.<br>  <br>  On the subject of the baby if she wants to go through with the pregnancy then there really isn't much you can do you'll have to support the child regardless, I understand that you have another child to support but you were careless enough to get pregnant then you just have to deal with it.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Well then don't marry her. But you have to pay child support any ways. Have you told her you love her? Never tell some one you love them if you don't. Its not right. <br>  Also, get a vasectomy and grow up. If you don't want to be responsible, don't have sex.|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	Okay, so did I miss the question? She was good in bed, apparently so good that she got pregnant. Don't put the baby through the misfortune of having to witness an unnecessary divorce later in life. Just be a good dad. You don't have to be married to do that.|`|3EiOobEVaa	Well that's exactly what you need to tell her...that she is a good girlfriend but you are not in love with her and not ready to get married. Do not get married for the wrong reasons. Good Luck!!!|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Looks like your paying child support for another kid. How about using some protection? No don't marry this girl she can do better, she'll find a guy who see's her as a person not someone who's good in bed.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	I don't think you should marry anyone until you learn how to wear a condom and spell properly.|`|m0DgqEcjaa	stop trying to wind pregnant women up, thats really low!!<br>  <br>  GROW UP|`|61wXpXVxaa	Explain to her your thoughts and feelings, maybe you can work something out that would work for the both of you, but since you did create this miracle together in some respects if she keeps it you will have to try and support your own child as best you can, unfortunately that is how it works.|`|FfHedeQyaa	Get your nuts snipped. You are obviously irresponsible and not mature enough to be a father to anyone. Pay child support.<br>  <br>  By the way, getting snipped is a good answer. You don't need more than 2 kids. Most men who are manly enough and not insecure do get it done.|`|n7NgsKxlaa	damn...try to fall in love with her. that's just plain heartless to get her pregnant and leave her to raise the kid by herself. i know this because that's what happened to my mom and i don't know my dad|`|MhyuXBoEaa	how about you keep your pants zipped then... SERIOUSLY!  And you are right you shouldn't marry this girl just because you got her pregnant but you don't have to be an *** either.|`|bEgjAZyFaa	Seriously??<br>  <br>  Get a clue!
11zPDTJ8aa	The best low maintenance cut is going to be a short side parted pixie cut above the collar and to the top of the ear. You could try something a little shorter like a close cropped boys style haircut, which is cut around the ears and to a wedge in the back. I wouldn't go for the crew cut yet. If the issues persist, you can have it done at a later date.<br>  <br>  Make arrangements with the stylist before you arrive for their haircuts and have the oldest go first. There may be some tears, but once it is over and they adjust to short hair, they will appreciate what you have done for them.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I cut my daughter's hair to just below her ears, because I got so tired of her whining about how it was sooo hard to brush, blah blah.  And now that I have gotten used to it, I actually like it better, and so does she.  It's also a great cut for a child who plays rough or does sports.  The only thing is, my daughter has naturally curly hair, so it looks good this way.  I don't think I would go that short for a child with straight hair.|`|j2mRop0laa	The 14 and 11 year old.. how about 2 inches below the chin with some side sweep bangs. They can straighten it themselves and wa-la a hip and trendy hair cut.<br>  <br>  For the 6 year old a cute little chin length bob would not be so bad.<br>  <br>  Personally, I love long hair on little girls. So I think it's only considered too long if it's past the butt. But what do I know? lol<br>  I soooo would NEVER consider a pixie.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Put the 6 year old's hair in a ponytail and/or pig tails when she plays.  Aside from that, they are all old enough to have a say in their hair.  Adolescents like fixing their hair, and there is nothing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  Save your battles for the important things.<br>  <br>  But, to be sure you get the right look try the style you are thinking on them first, on yourself.|`|AA11537580	don't go any shorter then a pixie cut, they will look like boys|`|eDPI5jYvaa	You can sell their long hair at: <a href="http://hairbuyer.com" rel="nofollow">http://hairbuyer.com</a>|`|1cYPOJkqaa	Don't cut your oldest daughters hair. She is fourteen. The only way to get her to sit still long enough to cut her hair is to pin her down. A fourteen year old who doesn't want a hair cut will not comply. And pinning her would be considered a form of child abuse.<br>  <br>   If she is taking care of her own hair, then it is her responsibility. It is different if you are still brushing her hair, but once she can manage to keep it neat on her own, it should be up to her (within reason though).<br>  <br>  Cutting your six year old's hair should be fine. Don't go too short, not even a pixie cut. She is likely to get teased in school for having "boy hair". Believe me, kids get picked on for that. And you will need to cut it every few weeks to maintain it.<br>  <br>  The eleven year old is between that. If she is able to maintain her hair then she should be allowed. It might be better if it were shoulder length or shorter, just for her to still be able to play with it, but it will still be neat.|`|dpBKz5twaa	Well if you were to teach your children that looks arent everything and how to have good character along with their looks then you wouldn't have to worry about it...but we aren't talking about that... I think that if you force your 14 year old to cut her hair she is going to resent you for doing it.  If she is willing to get up early and straighten her hair then let her, its her responsibility.  Also at 14 she is trying to figure out who she is, most 14 year olds go through very awkward stages cutting her hair will only make that worse.  This is the time when you really need to make sure you are relaying to her that looks aren't everything.  As for your other 2 children, start now relaying that same message, make sure they can have outward beauty but inward beauty is just as important.  I can understand wanting to have it short so it will be easy to maintain but listen to yourself, it sounds like you are trying to use your power as mother a little too much.  I am sorry if you don't like my post but its the truth.|`|xi7mq1xGaa	I'm with the people who think you should let your kids decide on how long or short their hair is. You're not the one who has to live with it - how would you feel walking around with a length of hair you really hated? It doesn't matter if you're not interested in bobs or longer - it's what the girls are interested in. That said, I can understand having some rules about its upkeep. I would insist on it being neat and tidy and that the younger ones have it tied back for school. And if you have to brush it and they moan then yes, I would insist that they either stop moaning or get it cut - because that affects you. But if they are happy to have it brushed then I don't think you can dictate that they have it cut. If you don't want to be the one to brush it ask them to do each other's hair - most girls love playing with hair. I understand why you don't want your 14 year old to be vain, etc, but I think as long as she accepts people who look different and doesn't judge others on their appearance then I would let her carry on with straightening etc. Girls her age can be horrible, and she's probably just trying to fit in so she doesn't get picked on. If she's happy to get up early to straighten it then let her - it's not as if you're expected to do it. If you force her to have a crewcut then unless she's the most popular gilr at school and the one who sets the trends, then I really think she would get picked on. I remember getting sick of my long thick hair when I was 16 and having it cut really short. Not quite crewcut but close enough. I remember walking into the school grounds and seeing people pointing and laughing at me. Kids are cruel - don't give them a reason to pick on your daughter.|`|sBfgCIbqaa	In my opinion you should cut the 6 year olds hair into a bob, in line with the jaw. For the 11 year old maybe just below the shoulder blade so she can still tie it up as she will be in year 6/7 now?! When i was that age I always had my hair up! For the 14 year old, try a Pob , or Posh Bob, this may take some persuading but it is so fashionable and people would admire her for taking the risk and (hopefully) it will pay off :) The trick is though not too push her into it just show her some pictures of it on people like Victoria Beckham and ask if she thinks it would suit her etc..<br>  Hope this helps :) x|`|d0231dcc170bb0de07aee5020b49aeeaaa	If your oldest is 14 already and she using straighteners and checking herself out in the mirror I thing it is too late to think about chopping it all off as this would cause you more arguments , be happy that she is looking after herself and not just letting go as some ids do and in my experience ( 2 daughters ) I would think most girls like long hair.|`|xhgA65M9aa	well im nearly 15 and i got fed up wif my own hair it waz down 2 my waist... so i went 4 a pixie cut i think a crew cut is a bit too far. i sometimes miss having my hair long because there was so much to do wif it but my hair cut suits me and all my friends love it... i advise you to  get them some nice clips, ribbons, and head bands so they can put something nice in their hair so they dont get so annoying about having not being able to do anything with it. but even with my hair i still use a straightener to make it spiky or flick out hehehe... i hope that helps|`|L3TnN3SNaa	very short|`|BXMHgiK5aa	They not not need long hair...wtf??
