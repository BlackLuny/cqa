20070708193329AAJY2k6	Social Science;Psychology	Que hacer con mi papa?	Hola a todos!   Tenemos problemas con la forma de ser de mi papa y no sabemos que hacer para que entre en razón o se "calme". Miren lo que hace:   -No quiere vender los muebles q tenemos (algunos de mas de 20 a?os) porque dice q todavia sirven y q costaron mucho. La verdad muchos ya estan da?ados por la humedad y su valor económico es muy bajo.   -Alguna vez leyó por ahi q uno de los hombres mas viejos del mundo habia llegado a esa edad porque todos los días se peleaba con alguien. Ahora el esta haciendo lo mismo. Nuestra vecina lo odia.   -No limpia ni ayuda a limpiar la casa porque dice q como tiene un problema en la espalda no puede hacer esfuerzo (espina bifida oculta, pero no lo inmoviliza)   -Mi mama le ha pedido el divorcio varias veces y no quiere aceptar. Pero se la pasa diciendo q vive en un "yugo" y ha llegado a insultarnos muy feo. Pero al dia siguiente se olvida y vuelve a tratarnos como si nada.      Entonces, alguien tiene algun consejo? Urgente! :P antes de volvernos locas. Gracias!

I mean I do not have anything against nice girls.  But for whatever   reason,  I can't help but shake this bad girl complex.  I just seem to   be mysteriously drawn to them for whatever reason.  I dated nice girls   in the past,  and have been for a while now.  But today,  I feel like   a baddy.   I find myself becoming rather jaded,  when I am with women   who are too passive.  Then I have a tendency to get bored and find my   way out of the relationship and their lives.   I really want a woman who is aggressive,  but is also   a nice girl.  Yeah that's it.   I want someone who can even out the odds,  and create balance.   Because I am easygoing, but  blunt and firm.  Do you   get what I am saying here.  Help me out..................
20090225081637AArkWS7	Social Science;Psychology	Problems with work environments?	Initially I liked every job that I took, but after a while I felt that I have to "play a role" and that the person who is at her desk is not me at all. I felt thoroughly fake. I was not allowed to come up with new solutions to things, not to say my opinion, not to do my job well, but had to stick to a mediocre average that was required. The environment was driving me crazy: NOISE, NOISE, NOISE, my boss playing her radio FULL BLAST, Horrid light that made me sick.   I had a pretty hard life, I have found my way around living in four different countries, my parents died when I was young and I had to look after myself.    Now I really want to go back to studying, but to do that I need to work full time. I am just so scared of having to go though all that faking and pretending all again, and have no idea how I can find a job that would not make me feel like I am lying to myself and to everyone around me. I am myself at uni, with my friends, but a at work I am a  zombie. I hate it so much. HELP! I need money to live on but I am phobic of work environments. Basically I made horrible experiences whilst working (was very enthusiastic when I started them in the first place) and lost confidence that there are jobs around that wouldn't make me want to stab myself repeatedly with a blunt knife. I felt so fake that I was ashamed to look into a mirror.

20090225083211AAB31hP	Social Science;Economics	Jealousy of the Recession-Proof Population?	Jealousy and envy of others goes against my faith. I have been blessed my entire life. For the first time now though, I find myself out of work and financially concerned.       I watch CNN more than I ever have before like a child looks to a parent to say,, "Everything's going to be okay."       In the midst of this, something started boiling in me. I see these TV anchors smiling, being playful, having a good time. On the Today Show, every day is a party. They're always happy, and they should be. It's their job, and they have secure positions or at least high-paying ones.      I heard that my favorite celebrity was married, and instead of being happy for her, I was envious. She and her husband are millionaires in their 20s, living a fairytale life while America's middle class is becoming homeless.       This is an internal struggle, and I would only admit this here where I am anonymous. But my angst may be felt by others.       I am doing all that I can to get work and to feel blessed to be okay for today. I want to rid my feelings of jealousy of people who are doing well, and be happy for them, but that's easier said than done. It's an evil pull, wanting everyone to suffer because you're suffering.       It makes no logical sense, but that's where I am right now.       Am I alone in this really embarrassing sentiment? How do you feel if you have been laid off and are seeing happy-go-lucky seemingly recession-proof people still enjoying life?

20090227121147AACIzk4	Social Science;Psychology	So called "Mental conditions"?	I don't know whether I am ignorant to the fact or not, but I do not think there is much "Mental conditions" out there. I agree with things such as Autism even though that really isn't a "Mental condition" but an actual condition, but nothing more really. Bipolar, Depression, ADHD, ADD, etc. All of that are more like "well they're not happy, well they're different, we've got to put a mental condition on them!" Come on. Both of my sisters... where put on antidepressents and neither of them got better--if anything they got worse. My brother doesn't settle down with his ADHD medicine--it seems to make him more rowdy.  I don't see the point in putting a medicine on something that simply doesn't exist.       What are your thoughts.   If your son/daughter/sister/brother had a "Mental condition" such as above, would you put them on medicine?   What have you noticed from those put on medicine?   Changes?

Yet never address the fact that even in female dominated professions like teaching, nursing and librarianship men STILL tend to outearn women and are "kicked upstairs" by the same men who were themselves kicked upstairs?      By "professions" I refer to those classified as ‘Professional Occupations’ in the Standard Occupational Classification, i.e.   ‘those occupations which require a degree or equivalent qualification, with some occupations requiring post-graduate qualifications and/or a formal period of experience-related training.        It has nothing to do with education or experience or hours worked; EXAMPLE: nurses of both genders often work a 60 hour workweek yet their male colleagues tend to be better paid.

Now my dad blames himself, for not taking care of my uncle for initiating or using his initiative to take my uncle for the check-up, being a doctor my dad is. And My uncle had come to our clinic saying he had problems breathing a year ago, but my dad just didn't follow up he forgot or something...I don't know, now one year later, he had a mild heart attack, then got admitted to hospital and passed away 3 days late once he heard he had 3 blocks in his heart, he panicked at the news and died once all visitors left (his family-his wife my dad) , he panicked thinking of the heart bypass surgery  and had a massive heart attack- died. ANd the Stupid hospital didn't let visitor in over night, and he's not used to being alone. So there was no one to keep talking to him and reassuring him..My father blames himself for not taking action earlier, my dad and my uncle are like good friends..So my dad is soo upset, and loosing weight not eating, and always talking about his mistake and philosophizing..My mum And i are very worried.WHat to do

20090227124114AAtOLGf	Social Science;Economics	Where does money come from, where is my tree of money?	I am neither Peter nor Paul, you may not steal from me to pay your Paul.  Where does your money come from?        But as Peter Schiff says: "We are not going to make anything until we have savings. And we are not going to have any legitimate savings with zero interest rates and the government borrowing it all and crowding out businesses. We are not going to have savings for business unless the government and consumers stop borrowing. Obama is not to allow this to happen. He is determined to create spending out of thin air, to create credit with the crank of a printing press. Any country that has tried this has led to disaster.”       Years ago I made a choice to earn a dollar, rather than seek it in some cushy sinecure of a government job or one in academia.  Yet what is that dollar which I may earn?  For it seems that Obama owns all dollars and says what they are.  That, to ne, is not the dollar I wish to earn.      So where does money come from and where is my tree of money?         Sign me, Free Man.        Peter Schiff vid:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-eE85uFv...

20090307042030AACaZ0f	Social Science;Psychology	I am so confused with this whole ordeal?	My boyfriend broke up with me over a text message. I found out he was tripping on "shrooms" and it upset me because we had a talk about him not doing them. When I found out I hung up on him and 2 hours later I get the break up text. He called me 2 hours after that apologizing and saying he didnt mean it and it's just a bad trip. I was as nice to him as I could be because I didn't want him freaking out and hurting himself because those types of drugs can make you act out of the ordinary. I told him it was ok and I still love him and all that to keep him from going deeper in the depression hole. The thing now is I was only telling him this to help him come back to a happy state of mind but I dont want to be with him anymore, what should I do?
20090227124012AAFU0NO	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Should Women's Rights Organizations (N.O.W.), start fighting for father's rights?	Court Holds That Same-Sex Partner Lacks Standing to Seek Child Custody    http://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_n...       There's a growing amount of divorce cases involving custody between married female partners, where the mother of the children claim her former partner does not have any rights to the child.  This is very similar to what fathers have fought for over the lat 30+ years.  Even if granted visitation rights, the mother can still violate her former partner's right by simply refusing to obey the orders.  Mothers, for the most part, are never punished in any way for violating these orders.  According to a U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services study, "Survey of Absentee Parents" a minimum of 60% of these orders are violated by the mother.      So, in order to fight for the protection of parental rights for non-custodial women formerly married to women, should Women's Rights Organizations (N.O.W.), start fighting for non-custodial father's rights?

20090307041619AAbpyRq	Social Science;Psychology	What kind of person am I?	I'm an introvert and I love to stay at home. Recently, my father undergone a surgery and he has to stay home for a month. In normal days, I'm all alone at home and I enjoy listening to my cds, watchin dvds, work out and internet. But since my father stayed here, something is going on in my mind. I feel like something is 'blocking' my concentration, i get lazy, i didn't work since then. It's been a month now. I feel weak already. I easily get angry also. My mind is always blank, literally. I've become forgetful of things and reminders. I clean the house always, but now I don't mind the mess around the house. I don't know, I see the mess and the dirty floor but my mind doesn't 'recognize' them. So I just ignored them.      My father is getting better now. When he goes out and I'm left alone, I feel like I've regain myself. I feel freedom. But when he goes back home, I feel lost and down again.      Would somebody please explain this? I'm like a stranger to myself. I just have no idea. Thanks.

The article says that feminism in Morocco is not at all the same as it is in western society. It says that women in Morocco do not compete for status with men. They even function in a different way. Even in everyday interactions woman-man confrontation is considered "improper" behavior.      It goes on to say that in Morocco feminism is a result of the encounter of culture and civilization opposed to civilization in the western society.       My question is this: Then why are the women there pushing towards feminism if they are opposed to the ways of western civilization?

Setahun yang lalu gue jadian sama si B (nilainya 8 deh). Untuk dapetin si B tidak mudah. Gue harus merebut si B yang saat itu sudah punya pacar (tapi sedang dalam keadaan break karena cowoknya selingkuh, tapi kemudian si cowok minta maaf dan ngajak balikan). Sekarang si B cinta mati sama gue. Segalanya sudah diberikan. Dia juga mendesak segera dinikahi. Cobaan datang seminggu yang lalu. Si A telepon bahwa dia mau putus sama cowoknya, sebab cowoknya tidak bisa memberi kepastian. Si A juga bilang, sebenarnya dulu dia suka sama gue, cuma guenya nggak aktif ngejar dia.      Kalo disuruh milih, sekarang gue milih si A. Gue ingin menikah dengan si A.Tapi bagaimana cara mutusin si B yang sudah 100% mencintaiku dan tidak mau cari cowok lain? Dia pernah bilang, kalau sampai gue mutusin dia, dia akan marah dan nggak akan pernah mau ketemu sama gue.      Jujur, gue sayang banget sama si B. Gue nggak mau dia sakit hati. Tapi logika gue bilang, bersama A gue akan lebih bahagia, karena si A adalah tipe gue banget.      TOLONG DONG KASIH SARAN. Thanks...

I would see myself sleeping, and i would see a shadow of myself go over my body. It looked like me in color only transparent and it would rise out of my body and through go through my house and into the laundry room. I would open the back door and see a pile of logs to my right. The old lady from Snow White and the 7 dwarfs (being scary to me at the time) would grab me and i would kick and scream but i couldn't get away. After failing to get loose, I would watch my "soul" or shadow go back into my body in bed. I had this same dream every night weather it interrupted my other dreams or I only had it.

And she remembers feeling a negative energy and looked over to her friend and saw him pushed against a wall by the negative spirit.  She yelled to it to let her friend go and once it did she felt she needed to leave immediately.  Then the second part of her dream started.  She saw a van and a little girl was in the back waving at her and the girl switched into a demon, very quickly she turned to look away and to her right were a bunch of kids and again the little girl was there and switched into a demon and when they were walking by her she switched back to a normal little girl.  She felt she was starting to wake and when she looked down her arms were crossed over her chest, like when a dead person is buried in a coffin.  Could anyone help me interpret her dream.  Thank you.
