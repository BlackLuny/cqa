20090309175451AAlH6ZK	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Do you know what song this is?	it's a mellow song with a man singing   he says "arms" and something about dying in arms      in the music video there's a girl   and he's there but not really seen by her until the end when they're dancing in the middle of the street   and then she snaps back to the present and he's not there   and she's stepping off the sidewalk/curb when he touches her on the shoulder n she looks back   preventing her from getting killed by a truck that was just about to pass   it ends with him walking away on the street      in the beginning she's alone at a bar drinking and he's just watching over her   and then she goes back to her apartment   and he's just watching her   that's all i remember for now...      thanks!
20090309175504AAKHibL	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Living music legend of the day: #2 Julio Iglesias?	You may wonder why this man can get nominated as a living musical legend, I mean he isn't a rocker, nor has he taken enough drugs to be a walking pharmacy like yesterday's choice.      But he is. Anyone who can sell over 300 million records, putting him in the Top-10 for international record sales is pretty mad, more so though is the fact that he had to learn to walk again after a serious car accident cost him a football career.      But most importantly, he is suave enough to have slept with over 3000 women in his lifetime.   Proof of his Suaveness:    http://www.azucarbg.com/web/images/stori...       He is paranoid about his security after his father (who although not a musician, is still a legend having sired children at the age of 89) was kidnapped in the 1980's. I still think it has more to do with the fact there may be a few jilted ex-lovers out there.      Some of his suave and sophisticated coolness:   Crazy:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9s25OUds...       I Want to Know What Love Is:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er4ZdOuoJ...

I think there was a boy who found a man who could pilot one of these large robotic suits, and they used it to fight against other pilots/robots. Only detail i clearly recall is a "bad" robot covered in bones and other such war trophies rising from the jungle, maybe it was chasing after the boy. Thanks if you can find the name of the movie...

20090309181208AAcpVWt	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	Young and Restless rumor?	BlogTalkRadio has a truly juicy interview with Nia Peeples (Karen), which is not only entertaining (Nia is hilarious), but also sheds some light on the current Winters storyline disaster.      Some highlights from the interview:       TPTB personally sought out Nia to play Karen even though the role's original description was that of a 23 year-old black female!       Nia loves Kristoff St. John (Neil). She says that he is always present in the scene and actually listens to what the other characters are saying.      And this is where it gets juicy...Nia says that a couple of weeks ago she had a dramatic scene with a female co-star who wasn't present and wasn't "in the moment."       Direct quote: "She didn't have very much to say in the scene, so she could kind of remember what it was, but she wasn't receiving what I was saying or what I was feeling, so the director actually stopped it."      The producers also chimed in over the intercom to reprimand Nia's scene partner. She says it took them four takes to get the scene right when it should only take one or two.       Nia says that Karen's story has been all over the place due to the many shifts in power that have taken place since she joined the show.      Back when Karen had the scene where she told Neil she couldn't have children and left for NYC, the character was actually being written out. They loved Nia, but they said that they were taking the storyline in a different direction. However, the show apparently forgot that they had already picked up Nia for another 26 week cycle, so they kept her on and wrote her into the Neil/Tyra/Ana story. Nia was actually the one to inform the show that she was already paid! In essence, she could have chosen to keep mum and just receive her paycheck for not working, but she really wanted to be apart of the show.      Nia has had questions about her character and story but has found Maria Arena Bell to be inaccessible. She hasn't returned any of Nia's calls or voicemails.   --------------------------------------...      So, boy and girls, is Nia out as Karen? Why else would she be so willing to give up this kind of info? Seriously, ya'll need to check this interview out for yourself! I'm sure I left missed some things. Discuss!       I hate Tyra and want her and Ana to hit the road.

20090309183940AAleLMk	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Libras: Do you still love your first love?	My only conclusion about my ex being so miserably in life is because he's still in love with his first love.       I remember one of the times we were dating, we ran into her and he suddenly grew really smiley and completely ditched me to talk to her.       He claims he's been in love with about 6 or 7 different girls and that is absolutely ridiculous and unbelievable. He's confusing "love" for infatuation. He falls in out of infatuation easily it seems.       With that being said, none of the 6 or 7 girls ever really make him as excited as he was when he saw her; his first love. Granted, he talked horribly about her, but I believe it's a cover up to hide his true feelings.

He proceeds to walk into the water and subsequently bumps into the preacher.   The preacher turns around and is almost overcome by the smell of alcohol, whereupon he asks the drunk,   'Are you ready to find Jesus?'   The drunk shouts, 'Yes, oi am.'   So the preacher grabs him and dunks him in the water.   He pulls him up and asks the drunk, 'Brother have you found Jesus?'   The drunk replies, 'No, oi haven't found Jesus.'   The preacher shocked at the answer, dunks him into the water again for a little longer.   He again pulls him out of the water and asks again, 'Have you found Jesus me brother?'   The drunk again answers, 'No,oi I haven't found Jesus.'   By this time the preacher is at his wits end and dunks the drunk in the water again ---   but this time holds him down for about 30 seconds and when he begins kicking his arms and legs he pulls him up.   The preacher again asks the drunk, 'For the love of God have you found Jesus yet.?'      The Drunk wipes his eyes and catches his breath and says to the preacher, 'Are ya sure dis is where he fell in?'         sorry the question how many t's
20090309184319AAOaSAp	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Do you know any good anime quotes?	Hi! I’m firstly just curious about all the interesting anime catchphrases out there, and secondly on the hunt for new series to watch that will inspire nice sayings to put on T-shirts. Designing my own iron-on anime-style shirts has become a hobby of mine, as well as a personal tradition for me at the anime club I attend. ^^      My favorite is Haruhi Suzumiya’s introductory speech: "I have no interest in ordinary humans. If there are any aliens, time travelers, sliders, or espers here, come join me. That is all!" or "Tada no ningen ni wa kyoumi arimasen. Kono naka ni uchuujin, miraijin, isekaijin, chounouryokusha ga itara, atashi no tokoro ni kinasai. Ijou!" It’s so awesome I committed myself to memorizing it in both languages.      Of course, there’s always the simple yet hilarious "ZETSUBOU SHITA!" ("I’m in despair!") from Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei.      Although I unfortunately could not bring myself to continue watching Mahoromatic after the first episode due to overwhelming fanservice, I still became a fan of her "Ecchi na no wa ikenai to omoimasu!"      And I’m slightly less than halfway through Gurren Lagann, but I loved Kamina’s whole "Believe in the me that believes in you!"      Does anyone else have any in mind? Romaji or English or both would be cool. They can be cute, funny, touching, or just well-known for whatever reason - I don't mind. Thanks in advance for answering!

She's well acquainted like the touch of a velvet hand like a lizard on a window pane.   2. Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays.   3 I'm up on the 11th floor and I'm watchin' the cruisers below.   4. She tied you to her kitchen chair, she broke your throne and she cut your hair...   5. Think I'll pack it in and buy a pick-up, take it down to L.A.   6. On the hill, their stuff is laced with Kerosene, but yours was kitchen clean...   7. the sound of gunfire, up in the distance, I'm getting used to it now.   8. I've got posters on the wall, my favorite rock group Kiss, I've got Ace Frehley, I've got Peter Chris...   9. We were sittin' ducks for the Police Man, we found a dirty faced kid in a garbage can.   10. I'm a flea-bit peanut monkey, all my friends are junkies...

20090309200534AAOk19c	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Need help finding a song and band.?	okay the song and the band i think can be found in the rockband video game but not so sure, the music video i saw yesterday (forgot the name today) was 90's rock day on the fuse, it was with the band and it was all flashy like color tie die, and the guy is like rapping the song (Has long hair wearing a jersey type shirt) and then he starts singing it (when he raps its more hard rock-ish and when he sings the tone changes) and the host of the show said it was real popular back in the early 90's. (NOTE : Isnt Red Hot Chillie Pepper      Band and song number two, song is probably easier to find, its a rock rap group of these 30-ish group of black guys, its real catchy, late 2008 song. music video shows them in this crazy world driving a car.

20090309202929AAxtLoh	Entertainment & Music;Movies	12 Monkeys: "Hey! What about the -"?	scientist from the future on the plane, and the virus???!!?      Every once in a while I see a great movie that ends terribly. I hadn't seen 12 Monkeys before just now, but I had seen Save the Green Planet, so I was prepared for its lurches through "that's real" to "ok that's fake now this is real" and so on. I wasn't pissed about the ending of Save the Green Planet either, because even though the mission failed and the Earth was destroyed, the movie at least finally explained itself.      12 Monkeys wouldn't explain itself. If a movie isn't gonna do that, it needs to end well. But it ended the same way Save the Green Planet did - Cole is pushed inexorably back toward his maybe-crazy mission, helped by maybe-now-also-crazy Dr.Rainer, and fails, getting shot dead. The scientist guy, who does work in the lab, which does have viruses, and he is carrying a bunch of vials of viruses that the security gets all suspicious about. He gets on the plane to San Francisco so the viewer has to assume that all is lost, 5 billion people are about to die.      But wait a minute, that lady on the plane he sits next to, who makes a cliche comment about violence and then introduces herself as "Jones in insurance," she's one of the scientists from the future!       So now the ending is not only a major bummer regardless of what was real and what wasn't. It's also a "say what?" Are the scientists from the future really the ones behind the plague? Is "Jones in insurance" somehow manipulating Cole to reach his death scene but making sure he doesn't actually kill the guy with the virus? Or is Jones there as a last resort - did they send her back to kill him on the plane, to finish the job that Cole failed at?   Or, worst of all, is the whole movie just a snot-dripping "violence is bad" lecture, told really horribly?      Answer only to try to make sense of the ending, please, not to praise it. Endings like that really piss me off.

20090309203838AAdsFwc	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Believe or Not Believe, what your CONCEPT of soul mate?	I think people have the concept of a soul mate totally wrong. I think soul mate gets a lot of stigma because people think 'soul mate' and they hear creepy music in the background, like something magical is about to happen, when that's not what it's about at all...      My concept of soul mate is this: You meet a person and there is a connection. Sometimes its a clashing, sometimes a total connection, but either way you can't seem to stay away from each other. It hurts to be apart.       I think you can have a lot of soul mates in life. They can be your friend, lover, mother, father, sister, brother... anyone. The entire point is the 'clicking', where you know that this person just BELONGS in your life...

20090309203257AA3XoVe	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Hilarious doctor joke! first time i've heard it! (must read!)?	Steve had suffered from blinding headaches for many years, since his late teens. He decided to try one last time to remedy his situation, and went to see a headache specialist. The doctor said, "Good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles."    Steve was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He couldn’t concentrate enough to answer, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife.    When he left the hospital he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.    As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different    person.    He could make a new beginning and live a new life. He saw a men’s clothing store and thought, "That’s what I need a new suit." Steve entered the shop and told the salesman, "I’d like a new suit."    The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said, "Let’s see ... size 44 long."    Steve’ laughed, "That’s right, how did you know?"    "Been in the business 60 years!"    Steve tried on the suit. It fit perfectly. As Steve admired himself in the    mirror, the salesman asked, "How about a new shirt?"    Steve thought for a moment and then said, "Sure."    The salesman eyed Steve and said, "Let’s see .. 34 sleeve and 16 and a half neck."    Steve was surprised, "That’s right, how did you know?"    "Been in the business 60 years!"    Steve tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly. As Steve adjusted the    collar in the mirror, the salesman asked, "How about new shoes?"    Steve was on a roll and said, "Sure."    The salesman eyed Steve’s feet and said, "Let’s see... 9-1/2 E."    Steve was astonished, "That’s right, how did you know?"    "Been in the business 60 years!"    Steve tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly. As Steve walked comfortably around the shop the salesman asked, "How about some new underwear?"    Steve thought for a second and said, "Sure."    The salesman stepped back, eyed Steve’s waist and said, "Let’s see size 36."    Steve laughed, "Ah ha! I got you! I’ve worn size 32 since I was 18 years    old."    The salesman shook his head, "You can’t wear a size 32. A 32 underwear would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache."

20090309202657AAbmAfK	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Plot summary/synopsis for Flatliners (1990)?	I am watching this movie right now on tv, and I missed the first half of the movie.  I gathered from the bits on IMDB about the movie what the movie is about, but I'd love to see a detailed summary of at least the first half.  Can anyone explain what happened in the first half?  Or do you have links to a summary of the movie?  I tried a few sites but can only see the short summary.      How does Winnie fit into the story?  What happened to Julia Roberts' character in the beginning?  What did Sutherland's character do in school that he's terrorized by a ghost  now?      I'm sure some of these questions will be answered later in the movie, but I am confused :D  I'm too intrigued right now to stop watching and rent it, though.      Thank you!

I'm a fairly new fan, so fact-finding is fun for me.   I found out this evening that Freddie couldn't drive a car.  Not because he didn't wanna, but because he si;mply didn't know how.  I'm wondering if this also has to do with the fact he was lefthanded?  A long time ago I watched a doc on the telly which talked about how alot of lefthanded people can't drive stickshifts.  Could this have been Freddie's problem?  I mean because I'm sure there were automatics in the UK back in the 1980's and maybe even as far back as in the 1970's so this really leaves no room for excuses.  LMAO this is too funny.  Fred was a real primadonna.

It's this guy singing with a farely high powerful voice and he sings something along the lines of "i can see it" then i cant understand the rest because he says it fast but i think i heard something like "shining sun" and then with the same tune as that he says "my love for you is strong".

I've been watching Sliders on www.tv-link.co.uk and fans will remember Prince of Wails - one of the first episodes, where the British won the war of Independance.  Benedict Arnold was a hero and George Washington was hung as a traitor.      The Regent was Prince Harold, we have a Prince Harry; would you like him as your Regent.      Given that the Queen isn't our ruler (but some of us would prefer her to the current lot of politicians - and those for the past 15 years - since Maggie actually) but we're talking about the realms of fantasy here, would you like to see  her visit her White Palace?      The capital wouldn't be known as Washington as he was a traitor in this dimension .... Arnoldville .... Benedicton; I think that has a ring to it .... Benedicton.

I watched the UNRATED version so for you who only saw the cut one than you probablymay not understand. First of all...how did Aubrey die? I mean, I know the husband snapped her neck, but he hung himself. He's dead! If he's a grudge spirit like the wife and son than he would've been in the first. Also, did the grudge possess Trish's body, or did the ***** just snap and kill him on her own? Did Trish or the grudge kill Lacey?  In a deleted scene it showed Eason opening the closet/attic door only to find a terrified Allison inside. The reason I am confused is that Allison saw Aubrey in there and Aubrey died AFTER Eason, but Eason was still alive in that scene. What the hell? One more question. Why the hell do victims just stand there, gasp and wait for the grudge to get them instead of just running. I mean, are there horror stories of smart people who prevail and beat the ghost and hollywood just decided that dumb people victimized is scarier?

20070319215004AAq7FsN	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Would a movie like this have a chance?	Do you guys think a musical with no real plot would  have a strong chance for box-office success on todays silver screen.  Although it wouldnt have a plot it would have a few occasional comedic skits which also would invole dancing. And the other "ringers" would be that it would be packed with a bunch ofyoung beautiful women(preferably REAL talenetd dancers[not actors]), dancing to great, upbeat music(i assure you; great music). furthermore it wouldnt be any hip-hop type break dancing stuff, but good-old fashion jazz-type dancing with "super-style". the movie also would be packed with cutting edge fashion.

20061124190107AAiyTA5	Entertainment & Music;Music	What is the name of and who sings this christmas song (partial lyrics included)?	This song was played on the radio probably around 1990 but I have been unsuccessful in finding who sang it or what the same of the song is (or where I can find it to hear it again).  I believe it was song by a young school girl in Baltimore, but I have no basis for that other than a vague recollection.        The lyrics/refrain went something like this:   You can keep the toys dear Santa, / cause they're not on my list /   it isn't very long this year cause i only have one wish. /    See, Mom and I are all alone and we're here on our own. /   Santa can you bring my daddy home?        I don't think it ever has been produced, which I find surprising.  Maybe this year it will make a comeback.  Thanks for your help.

Zhang Yu had videotaped her and her friend being taken advantaged of by a Director or Casting Director for a role in a film.  She's now coming out against the film studio with the video proof.  I guess she didn't get the part.      My question is, would you be willing to take part in this "casting couch" to better your career? (or maybe not, meaning there are still no promises after the couch as  Zhang Yu found out.)  Would it matter if it meant your income had the opportunity to make you millions, depending on your success and talent?

It is a little painful holding the cover in my hand and not seeing you-know-whos lovely face on it : (
20081007171203AAqJN8n	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	R&P: Here's my big, fatty review of Queen + Paul Rodgers new album I promised(Really Long...)?	Okay R&P, so I bought the new Queen + Paul Rodgers album "The Cosmos Rocks." I was very hesitant to listen to it, but I had to remind myself that Brian and Roger were still playing together on it thanks to "A Kind Of Magic", one of my favorite contacts...Now, being a major Queen fan, naturally I would be a little biased and would try to give them a good review. But this is not Queen.  This is Queen minus Freddie Mercury and John Deacon.  This is Queen + Paul Rodgers.  After leaving this album on my dresser and just staring at it for a while, contemplating if I should even listen to it, I finally did - so here goes my huge fatty ginormous review:      1.  The opening number is the song that gives the album its namesake, titled "Cosmos Rockin'" It starts out with warped vocals much like in "One Vision", only they sound worse and ask " what planet is this" then blares in with some happy sounding guitar and a good beat.  It features the lyrics "We got the whole house rockin' to the mighty power of rock n' roll" ummm... not their best songwriting. Overall the song is upbeat and kinda rocks...I would like to hear more of their famous backing vocals though...nice guitar solo      2. Time To Shine - Starts out a piano bit, then enters with Rodger's vocals.  The chorus has an uplifting message/tone "raise up your mind/its time to shine" not bad, not good, but not bad. It sounds absolutely nothing like Queen. Roger shines on this track, no pun intended.        3. Still Burning - Written by Brian, this song begins with a good beat and showcases the famous Queen backing vocals, but they sound different; deeper. Contains the lyric "music makes the world go round" again, not their best.  Towards the end this song featured WWRY's famous "stomp stomp clap" whch made me smile - it was one of my favorite points on the whole album.      4.Small - Written by Brian May, this song starts out as kind of an acoustic number, pauls voice is smooth and sounds good.  It features a great solo by my favorite guitarist(the man has not lost his touch on that red special)      5. Warboys - Great Drums in the begginning, features the line when the lighting explodes I pray for your soul"  Ummm....yeah...I'm not diggin' that line...Didn't care too much for this song.      6. We believe - Written By Brian, this track has kind of an apocolyptic tone. Contains a constant "I believe, You believe" tradeoff.      7. Call Me - Whoah...I like this song! Its upbeat, sweet, contains the line "Call me if you need my love." Its pretty melodic and has a great BM solo with that great tone once again.  This track stood out among the others...      8. Voodoo - Written by Roger Taylor, this song starts out with a spanish style sounding guitar.  Features some of the famous Queen tounge in cheek(something this album could have used way more of) with the lyric "when the moon rises the dogs will howl look out your window I'll be on the prowl"...Werewolf, anyone??      9. Some Things that Glitter - I love the song title, but when in the first few lines Paul Rodgers exclaimed "once I loved a butterfly, don't ask me how don't ask me why" I had to groan out loud.       10 C-Lebrity - Written by Roger Taylor and is the first (and I think only) single off the album. Starts out with Brian doin' some stuff slightly reminicent of "Keep Yourself Alive" (ever so slightly).  Also has a mad solo courtesy of Mr. May.        11. Through The Night - Starts out with a great guitar tone...a smooth sounding song...it's just...well it's just not that good...      12. Say It's Not True - written by Roger, this song is a highlight on the album, only because it starts off with Roger taking the vocals.  He sounds great, though aged.  Then he passes the vocals to Brian May.  This is possibly my favorite part on the entire album.  It was so nice to hear Bri's voice, he just sounded so sweet and filled with emotion like he always does.  They should have let him sing a little more...The song itself is actually pretty good, it was written for a Nelson Mandela charity event...some great guitar parts...gosh Brian sounded fantastic on this track. Just great.        13. Surfs Up...Schools Out - Starts out with a horrid scream from Paul. It was truly bad. It sounded like he was trying to pull a Roger Daltrey in "Won't Get Fooled Again" but it was just horrid.  the song isn't too great, it features the line " I got a criminal urge to twist and shout"...yuck.       Now, let me say that I have mad respect for Paul Rodgers, and let me tell you why: The dude knew he had some very large (very classy) shoes to fill, and he does his best, but I'm just happy that he in no way tries to pull a Freddie. On the entire album. He in no way tries to "be him" or use any of his vocal techniques or anything. That made me happy.       Overall, the album had a few high points, but I'd have to say that the album was a dissappointment.  As much as It pains me to write it, ( I don't want to be that person in Spinal Tap that writes "sh*t sandwich"),

20080315113912AA7o2tq	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Best way to make a Shippuuden Temari costume?	I've looked through plenty of tutorials relating to making Temari (from Naruto Shippuuden) fans to sandals to costumes, and I've basically just confused myself further. The things I need most help on is the sandals, wig, and fan.    If you know of a website that helps you create any or all of those things, please post it. And it would be helpful if you have MADE the thing yourself, and you recommend it.    I'm going to Arizona, and I've heard there's a Chinatown somewhere in the state where I can buy a large fan. Any painting/spray painting recommendations (type of paint to use)? Any particular way you styled the wig? And the most critical part of the costume, Temari's Shippuuden sandals. Post a link to your favorite tutorial (Trust me, I've seen a ton, and I'm not sure if pulling a sock over the sandal or bringing out the glue gun will work for my time and budget). I have about 18-19 days until it is due. Any advice will be welcome! Thanks!

Bokutsatsu Tenshi Dokuro-Chan....its the best series...ever, but how come its so short?? ALso there are other series, like Elfen Lied...its unrivalled in quality and awsomeness, but its only 13 episodes...a clear example would be the two Hellsing series. The craptastic 13 episdoes TV series was long and it wasnt that great. BUT how come the short 4 episode OVA, Hellsing Ultimate, is SO much better then the TV series even though its so much shorter??    And how come there are series that are no where NEAR as good as stuff like Elfen Lied but they are so ridiculously long despite not being as good...(for example, I dont hate Naruto and all, in fact the fight involving Sasori was awsome, but overall stuff like Naruto or Inuyasha or Bleach is NOTHING in comparison to series like Dokuro-Chan or Elfen lied)       Anyone got recommendations? Series that seems a bit too short, but is unparalelled in greatness?

Hola, a mi hija de 4 a?os le encantan TODAS las peliculas de Disney, entre muchas otras que son para ni?os. Se las sabe de memoria casi casi.   Actualmente sólo hablo a diario con ella por teléfono, y de lo que mas le gusta hablar es de sus peliculas. Le gusta que le haga preguntas acerca de sus peliculas... Como es lógico, yo ya no me acuerdo, o sólo las vi una vez... Una especie de trivia, por ejemplo:   - Como se llama la bruja de Blanca Nieves?   - Cómo se llaman los sobrinos de Donald?   Y preguntas por el estilo...   Ayúdenme por favor a realizar una trivia mas completa con sus respuestas, porque diario le hago las mismas preguntas, y ella dice que ya le cambie ... ja ja ja      Gracias       Detalles adicionales   Ayúdenme, pero con más preguntas diferentes que se les ocurran a ustedes, con sus respuestas, y de cualquier pelicula para ni?os.... Yo sólo lo puse como ejemplo...   Gracias

Hola, hace algunos a?os vi mi primera película porno, la cual es una película muy vieja (al menos eso parecía). Al inicio estaban una mujeres acostadas en una cama, solo una de ellas estaba completamente desnuda, las otras estaban vestidas, y la que estaba desnuda estaba acostada en el centro de la cama, en eso llegan los chavos, creo que uno de ellos traía un short de esos largos y se ponen a platicar todos, depués una mujer le empieza a hacer sexo oral a este chavo de los shorts cortos y ahi comienza la acción. Recuerdo que también hay hombres ******, hay una escena que a lo mejor con eso la reconocen en donde uno de los hombres se viene justo en la camara. Espero me puedan ayudar quiero esa pelicula y no se ni como se llama, solo tengo el recuerdo, ayudenme por favor, o si alguien la tiene facilitemela por fis, ah y estaba en VHS. Saludos a todos.

Hola, desde diciembre me fijo en una chica que veo cada semana en un autobus a la misma hora, y hacemos casi el mismo recorrido para volver a casa.   Para llamar su atención mientras esperabamos en el autobus me dedique a hacer una flor de papel.   La semana siguiente un dia antes de que volviese a verla le puse una flor en papel justo delante de su puerta de casa y la cogió.   El dia siguiente esperando el autobus (30 min) me sente a su lado note como si quisiera hacerse notar, hacia como ruidos con sus dedos sobre el asiento de la parada, me miraba a veces de reojo o a traves de una ventana donde se veia mi reflejo, (creo que si tuviese miedo no se hubiese quedando esperando media hora a mi lado, o se hubiese levantado y a esperar a otro sitio).   En el autobus (entro primero) se sento al final del todo (se sentaba siempre por el medio). Yo como un imbecil me sente donde siempre, quizas deberia haberme sentado tambien en el fondo, no se como interpretar los hecho ni que hacer ahora,ayuda

20081004204025AArIjBK	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	WTF I don't know why these girls hate me ?	Ok, well I'm the new 15 year old sophomore in school. I used to live in Los Angeles, CA and now I live in NY. And I am the sweetest person you'll ever meet, I don't have an ounce of ***** inside of me and these girls are always making fun of the way I look.I naturally have long jet black hair with side bangs and layers (My hair is about mid-back), tan skin, green-blue eyes, and high cheekbones.   And everyday I have to have a mean comment about how I'm a "fish" because of my cheekbones. Or that I lie and go tanning 24/7 because of my tan skin when I don't. My mom is Brazilian so I get the tan skin from her. And they say I wear color contacts when I don't. I've even stuck my fingers in my eyeballs to prove they're my natural color.      My eyes aren't even that special anyways. They're normal green bluish eyes. And I get made fun of because I'm not like the rest of the girls who have ice blue eyes. And I hear all the time how I'd look a BILLION times better if my green eyes were blue and blue eyed girls are better. Green isn't all that. And that I'm all around ugly.      And then it's my clothes. My parents are both dentists, and my parents spoil all their kids, but at the same time we're not brats and we do have responsibilities like clean our rooms and getting good grades. And I get good grades because I try really hard in school, I get about 3.8s for my GPA and they say I cheat when I don't.       And they make fun of the fact that I'm staying pure until marriage.      WTF! I didn't do anything, I cry myself to sleep every night because these girls are so mean to me.Why are they like this? I'm so nice and sweet and didn't do anything to get on their bad sides. I have NO friends. What is this?

20081116193458AAjBsHE	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	R&P, let's explore the science of the "band?"?	What is it about a band that makes it so cool? On first glance, they're just nothing more than a group of people who stick together and play music. Kinda like a group at your workplace, school, etc. But yet, they have a magical, almost divine quality about them that commands your respect and devotion (and your wallet). Somehow, these individuals, while not much by themselves, form a juggernaut of epic musical proportions, that can touch your soul, and give you feelings you never knew you had.       What are your thoughts on bands? What makes them so special to you?

20081113193027AAwQsJk	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Without being all "psycho stalker fan" on me - why are the twilight books so popular?	I've never read them. I'm not a big fan of the author though. All I ever hear about is Twilight - and those who believe vampires exist. Oy.      So, why are they good? Is it a good plot? A catchy store? What is it that turned the readers into crazy fans? I was just watching the news and a bunch of people are sitting in the rain waiting for the actor from the movie. Is pneumonia really worth a book?       When the book first started getting popular my sister's step-daughter cried [literally cried] because someone died in the books.       Someone, please explain this all to me....

20081027165131AAyCWHD	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	What is the most far-out PLOT ever on a daytime soap opera?	I need a list of the craziest, wackiest plots ever seen on daytime soaps. Feel free to tell me one from more than one show, because I need at least one from each daytime soap opera. Be story specific, not just something like "Luke gets out of every scrape he gets in; he's like Jack Bauer," but more like "That Ice Princess story with freezing Port Charles really tested the limits of believability." Complete sentences not necessary :) You get the idea. Daytime soap operas only, and it has to be a plot, not just an event. Like One Life To Live's Eterna, GH's Ice Princess etc. And actual storyline, not just "There's no way she would have answered her cell phone that time!"

20081026184403AAzwd2x	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Looking for amazing female vocalists?	Okay well, there is obviously Celine Dion (best female vocalist of our time in my opinion) Amy Lee (not so great in concert :( but w/e),   humm see I really don't like of today's female "pop singers" so those being left out thank you.     I'm also big on chicks that can really rock out.  The lead vocalist of Flyleaf comes to mind of course.  There is the lead singer of the group "Within Temptation", (she's easily in the same league of Amy Lee) and more recently Lacuna Coil ( i don't know if she has any big songs besides "Our truth", if anyone knows any besides that song by her let me know k?      So...yeah any other female artists, songs, (even if it was a 1 hit wonder), mind you it doesn't have to be rock songs I did mention Celine >_>
