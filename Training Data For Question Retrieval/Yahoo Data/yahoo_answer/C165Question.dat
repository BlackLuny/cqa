20090223112519AAkx8mD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Can a 15 year old be ready to start their own life?	Just imagine, if your a child genius that has graduated from university,aged 15, and you've got a job that pays a lot of money and that the marriageable and parental home leaving age was 15, can your body be developed enough to have a child that is as strong as normal healthy baby with no emergency c-section, small sized compared to a baby born to a woman aged 22-34 and have no major or minor health problems being born to a normal healthy 15 year old person with absolutely no health problems what so ever.
20090223112724AAqZyjQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Could this be an allergy?	My son is 4 weeks old, I am bottle feeding him breastmilk (not by choice, but you gotta do what you gotta do...).  For the past few days whenever I feed him, he gets these red pimple like bumps all over his face and head.  The bumps go away shortly after he's doing eating.  A few minutes into his bottle he lets out a lot of gas, almost explosive, sometimes resulting in a dirty diaper.  Could it be he's developed a sensitivity to my milk, or something that I've been eating?  My diet has been the same since I've had him, I even stopped drinking milk because my husband can't tolerate milk, so I thought that was the culprit.  Is this normal for a baby this age?  New mommy here, just curious.  Thanks.

She usually falls asleep nursing, but lately she's been sort of "test biting" (with her gums, no teeth yet), she looks at me when she does it and smiles when I yell "ouch",she keeps repeating it and when I take her off the breast she starts crying!

20090223112728AATAt3S	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Obviously no one can handle this question?	I had sex around the middle of my cycle- unprotected. Before my expected period I had NO pms symptoms. Only mild cramping in my back and lower abdomen. On the 18th which is less then a week early for my period.. I started my period. Although it has been a really weird period.. Very light (I could use less then a tampon a day TMI) This period was like that for 3 days and then gone yesterday. Normally my period is light the first part of day #1 and then by the end of the day its a heavy flow for the next two days. Periods usually last about 5 days. Shortly after I got my "period" I became pretty ill... With sore throat glands, stuffed up, extremely bad sweating mostly at night and random times in the day, Headaches, dizziness, lower back pain (feels almost like cramping in my back) and very light lower abdomen cramping (some times there is a sharp pain that happens but then quickly goes away). Today the back pain isnt nearly as bad as i took some IBP. This morning my husband and I had sex again. Afterwards I went to the bathroom and when i peed it felt like something had fell out of me. I looked in the toilet and it looked no like a blood clot but sort of like tissue with a small amount of blood on it. Could this be a misscarriage even tho i experienced minimal blood? Or could this be the begginning of pregnancy (althought i took a test yesterday it came up NEG)? I feel "weird". Like why is my body doing this? Has anyone experienced this?   Also about 4 days before my "period" My husband and I had sex and we had to stop because i had a little bit of bleeding. Maybe we were to rough or something but i dont usually bleed after sex :S   Anyways, Thanks ladies i hope there is someone here that has went through this and can relate. Hopefully you have some good feedback!!!      :-)
20090223112738AAabmyN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why am I not losing the baby weight?	I had my baby over 7 months ago.  I breastfeed her.  With my first I was not able to breastfeed and I lost the weight just by cutting some calories and no exercise.  I always thought that breastfeeding makes you lose weight, but I find that not only I am hungry,  I am barely losing any weight.  I eat fewer calories than the first time I lost weight, walk a few times a week...but very slooooooooooooow weight loss.  I asked the pediatrician if breastfeeding can make it difficult to lose weight and she said no, the only time you may have problems is if you are eating too much.      I really want to lose the weight.  I am traveling to some relatives who made fun of me for being fat the first time.  I feel uncomfortable eating or dressing around them esp that they are very thin people.  I am thinking of weaning my baby or at least feed only once a day.  I really love the bonding and the way she looks at me, but I don't want to go there fat.  Is there a scientific reason why breastfeeding make it hard to lose weight?      I am sad...

Our normally placid, happy 7-month-old has suddenly become very fractious, with her emotions changing on a dime.  She'll be laughing and happy, which will change into grumpy/crying/screaming, and then back again.  I've tried the usual list- changing, feeding, distracting, offering toys, letting her crawl around, but nothing seems to do the trick.  She really is (usually) quite cheery, so I don't know what's going on.  I don't think she's teething (she doesn't have any teeth yet, but doesn't seems eager to chew anything and there are no signs of teeth beneath the surface), but I don't know what to do.

Also, do you think they could use the DVD-R so I can have it recorded to DVD instead of VHS???         Hope this didnt confuse anyone.

20090223115405AAea2TE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Question for parents of adult children (30+)?	OK, so synthesizing what I have read, it seems to me that social scientists (psychologists, sociologists, etc.) currently think that a person's personality is approximately:      75% genetic   15% environmental, from adolescent peer group   10%% environmental, from family      By personality I mean just that, personality. I do NOT mean lifestyle choices or political beliefs. It's perfectly possible for a conservative Christian and a libertarian Pagan to have very similar personalities.       For obvious reasons, I would be especially interested to hear from someone who has raised both their own biological children and also an adoptive or foster child from infancy.

Im just worried if i leave it until tomorrow (more than 12 hours) to make a doctors appointment that it will get very bad.

I dont want her to end up REALLY ill. I had bronchitis a few years back that nearly turned into Pneumonia, it was horrid, I dont want my daughter to go through the same. In a parents view what should I do.

I am 28 weeks pregnant, and i have already gained about 25-30 lbs. My first baby ( a little girl) is to be born on may 16th. My 21st birthday is a month later, at the end of june.

(i was a size 9 before baby and now i'm a size 15-17) i was just wondering how much i could expect to loe by june, to see if i should go out n spend money on a bikini, or a tankini, or if i should stick with a plain ole 1 piece. any comments or suggestions on how to lose it faster, would be GREAT!!!!!

I guess her cold turned into croup. She's just miserable and getting annoyed at her sickness. She's usually happy no matter what but its starting to take its toll.      Is there anything I can do to hurry the disease along? The doctor said they don't give medicine for croup, you just gotta wait it out.

Do you find it frustrating when people clearly don't read your answer or question properly?      I've answered a few questions today, then people give a thumbs down and answer the exact same way or criticize after giving the same answer. In many questions, people ask things or answer things that were actually in the question (like, 'how old is your baby' when it's right in the question!).      I just answered that a 13 week old is a little young for teething, but it still could be teething. I got thumbs down and then people answer that it could be teething even that young. It's the same answer!! Frustrating.      Just curious! Thanks!      (I posted here because I usually enjoy the feedback from the folks who hang out in parenting...)

20090223120414AAoEgqZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why are some people so ignorant and have no glue?	I was in a small thrift store today, and as I was leaving I see a baby girl around the age of 6-9mths of age in a stroller. The baby was trying to grab onto some beads in front of her. The parent of this child was no where to be found, it looked as if the parent had moved the baby into a position, so that the baby would be out of ones way if they where trying to get through. The baby was in front of a tall shelf obscureing anyone's view if they were to look stright ahead they would not have seen the baby. The only reason I did was because I was leaving the store. I was appauled at what I saw, how can anyone this day in age just leave their child and walk a way to look at things in a store. I then started asking people in the store if this was their child, other people then also started to take notice and started to make comments about the situation too. Finaly after customers started talking, someone taped the mother on her shoulder and asked her if it was her child. The mother was looking at clothing in the store  about 150 feet away from her child on her cell phone, and unaware of all the commotion that was going on around her. Again she would not have been able to see if someone took off with this child because that tall book shelf was in the way. I just can't wrap my mind around people like that. I bet she would not of left her wallet with money in it just sitting there, hoping no one would bother it, why would she leave her baby that is priceless in hopes that know one would bother her? I even had an elderly guy thank me for speeking up.

We send them gifts and money for various occasions and only hear from his daughter, not his two sons. She usually sends a quick myspace message telling us thank you and how much she loves the gifts. But the boys never respond. I can assure you they accept and use the gifts.       It irks the crap out of both of us, and my mother in law, who gets the same icy feeling from the boys. They are way too old to be so rude. My husband says he doesn't want to send anymore presents to them. Is there a way I can approach the subject and ask them to respond graciously when they receive a gift?

Now, three months later it is slightly larger than a pencil eraser, raised up like a large mole and bright blood red.

I know she's tired because she doesn't play or anything, she just cries, so i pick her up and she's fine for a while if i stand with her, but she absolutely hates being rocked or having someone hold her when they're sitting down. if i just lay her in the crib, she screams bloody murder.       bed time is at 8:30. so at 7:45, i get her dressed and ready for bed. then dim all the lights and play lullaby's in the background. i'll walk around holding her until she starts crying cause she wants to get down, then i'll set her down (she'll start crying almost immediately), then i'll pick her up. and i do this over and over until she just isn't happy no matter what (usually around 8:45ish). then i put her in the crib, she screams for 2 minutes, then she's out.      should i just continue this hour long routine? or are there some other things i can try?      the mom just said "she goes down like a dream for us, no problems. so just do what you have to do to get her down"      thanks.

I have such a huge supply it's not even funny. So I thought it would be kinda cool to help out another baby or parents who want to give their adopted child breast milk. Getting some money isn't so bad either, even if I wasn't paid I'd like to donate. Are there really "Breast milk banks"?

My son is crazy about the paci and he had a bunch of them but I told my husband when he lost the last one I wouldn't buy any other.   He is 15 months old.

20090223122334AADRtsY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Experienced parents please: when you HAD "the talk" with your children, how did it go?	Did you do in a age-appropriate phases, or at all once?      Was there any awkwardness?      And, I suppose most importantly, you know how we always throw in there "If you have any questions, please feel comfortable to ask me."....? did any of your kids ever really come back to ask you?      With my oldest, I had about a 2 hour talk with her, broaching all subjects, when she was in 4th grade, and frankly, I was never sure if that was the right approach.      With my younger 2, we have gone in phases, and it seems to be working out well. My son, age 10, had his first talk yesterday, mostly consisting of changes that will start happening soon, and it being okay when he starts thinking girls are cute.      My daughter, age 11, had phase 2 yesterday, body changes + a little more elaboration on attraction.      By which methods have you incorporated the so-called facts of life into your children's knowledge?   Thank you.

20090223105739AA2wdZ3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Could I be pregnant?  I thought I was but..?	I have no signs of pregnancy OR period.  The only thing that happened this morning was some slight spotting.  I thought it was my period but when I checked now, there was nothing on my pad. Could I be pregnant.  I havent taken a pregnancy test.  I had my period last month on the 22 or something and ovulated between the 2 of Feb and the 6 or 7th.  I checked a calculator online and it said that I should take a pregnancy test now..which I should I know but what do others think?  PS..Im very excited about this.  (Hoping to have another little one)

20090223114215AApniQ4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Does anyone have experience with tongue ties and breastfeeding?	I ask because we have a strong family history of this. My husband is tongue tied so badly that he can only barely stick out his tongue- maybe an inch or so. (and this is AFTER the surgery he got done in adulthood to correct it- the dentist said it was one of the worst he had ever seen, and it was a wonder his speech was normal.)             My little niece, 4 years old, (my husband's sister's child), also has a really bad tongue tie that caused her some speech issues. My sister in law tried breastfeeding but my niece couldn't latch due to the tie (and nobody knew why she was having such difficulties.) My SIL was in horrible pain, she had cracks that bled badly, and she cried because she felt like a failure. Not knowing what was wrong, after weeks of hell, she had to switch to formula. Who knows how many others in the family have had this problem, because everybody was formula fed. (Nieces, nephews, siblings, etc.) No kidding.       Anyway....I want to make sure nobody misses it if my daughter (due in 12 days) has the same thing. How can I tell if she has a tie? And what kind of treatment/surgery will she need if so? I really want to breast feed.       Thanks!
20090223114846AABrpDh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	At what age can temper tantrums start?	One of my best friends has a little boy. He's three years old now and very well behaved. She told me recently that when he was a baby he was a little angel for the first several months, then at 8 months he had his first tantrum. She said he would get them all the time! Fortunately he outgrew that stage.       Is this common? I would have thought tantrums began in the Terrible Twos. How on earth would you handle a tantrum in a baby? I wouldn't know what to do- it's not like you can reason with them, or do time out.       I'm just curious, I'm expecting a little girl in a matter of days. :)       (If she's on time!)

I didn't get mine until I was 14, so they probably won't be getting them for at least another 5 years. But do you think it would be sensible to mention it to them soon?      I would talk to them about it separately so that they can each have their own personal questions and not be embarrassed in front of their sister.       I don't think they need to know the details, just that it happens, and it will one day. So that they won't be so shocked in 2 years time when they get sex ed.       Are they too young at the age of 6? When did you mention it to your daughters?

But right now I'd like to know if there's a way to stop really quickly.  I just got into a bit of an argument about it.  I'm not breastfeeding.

But I don't still want to be lactating whenever they send him home.  I feel I'll probably be demanded I do it since there would be 'no excuse not to'.  So, any way to stop rather quickly?

20090223113135AA6Dxdp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Possibility of inherited family trait of difficult conception...?	Sorry guys, this is a long one...      So, I was watching a show on TLC about genetics and inherited traits, and it might have dawned on me why I am having such a difficult time conceiving a child. Here are a few traits in my family and I would love some insight as to what your opinions are:      1. On my mother's side, I have 2 uncles and 3 aunts. One uncle has a healthy, wonderful son. Other uncle has no children by choice. Of my aunts, one of them (aunt #1) has a different father than the other two (aunt #2 and #3, and my mother) and the same father as the uncles. Her children are healthy and she had no problems with conceiving or maintaining a pregnancy.      2. Aunt #2 had her first child when she was 33, and had no problems conceiving or carrying him. Then decided to expand her family when she was 40. Between the ages of 40-51(current age) she has had 2 children, one full term stillborn, and 2 miscarriages.      3. Aunt # 3 decided to start a family when she was in her late 20's. She had difficulty conceiving and miscarried 4 times before finally having a healthy baby girl at 31, then a healthy baby boy at 34.      4. I am an only child, and my mother had no problem conceiving me.      5. Aunt #1, aunt #3, my mother, myself, and my cousin have all been diagnosed with severe endometriosis. All aunts, and my mother have had hysterectomies because of this.      So, I know that genetics can be a headache. And that their male partners could have played a role in some of the fertility issues they have had. But does this sound as though it could be a possible genetic trait? I have a doctor’s appointment on Thursday and plan on asking him since it never occurred to me to ask him as I have no idea why I never thought about this before.      But what do you guys think? My husband and I are in our 4th year of TTC, have had 3 miscarriages and one ectopic pregnancy, and are getting ready to have testing done as to why we are having difficulties.      Thanks!

My daughter is currently 19 months old. Have any of you used a toddler bed? Or did you just go right from a crib to a twin/full/queen size bed? At what age do you think you should switch from a crib to bed? My daughter does good in her crib, she hasn't tried to climb out yet. I don't want to ruin that. I know that at age 19 months she definately wont stay in a bed yet. The crib does have the ability to change to a toddler bed, but I borrowed it from someone, and i'd like to return it instead of having it even longer.   thanks!! :)

20090223121939AAD9AmU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Please help with 18 month old daughter?	ok last thursday night my daughter (18 months) swallowed a small screw (one of the screws that held the battery door compartment closed on one of her toys) anyway she was at the ER (that night) and at the DR friday. the DR took an xray and said that it's just a tiny little object and that it was in her large intestine which meant it was passing through her system that she would be fine and that the object would come out in her poop. he said it would take 2-3 days. now my question is since friday she has pooped about 6-8 times, each time i check the poop but i haven't found it yet. sometimes it's not easy to check the poo but i'm doing my best. he told me that by the end of this week if i haven't found it and i was worried i could go back and get her another xray. my question is ... do you think that the object has come out in her poop and i just missed it? should i go back at the end of the week if i still haven't found it? what would you do?      another question but different subject. in the last two days my daughter has gotten two huge pimples on her chin. this is unusual for her but i was wondering if it's normal for an 18 month old to have pimples like that? i havent fed her anything different and i stay away from fried foods. should i be worried about her skin? is there something i can do to ease the pain because when it gets huge and red and the white head pops out it irritates her. any suggestions?

20090223121046AA3nkd5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Do women only ever get one baby shower?	Do women only get a baby shower for their first child? I had a child 8 years ago and my mother threw me a shower. Now I am pregnant again with my new husband and this will be our first child together but my mother has been telling my family that I can't have a shower because you only get one. On top of that, the father's family has been asking him when my shower is because they all bought gifts. They don't live close and don't know my family at all so it would be awkward and difficult if they threw one since i really don't know them. Is this right or is my mother just cold?

20090223102800AAOqJ4h	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Does my 5 year old have ADD? Gifted? Just the personality?	Background: My child is 5. My husband and I are married and get along well, rarely arguing and never screaming or creating chaos. My child has a fairly basic routine but we don't stick to it like glue. She goes to pre-k 3 days a week and they say she's exceptional while she's there. Teachers pet, never acts out, helps other kids, etc.   ____________      She has difficulty standing still in any situation. At her calmest during the day she will still frantically play with the buttons on her clothes, kick the ground, play with her hair, etc. At night I read her a book (something she picks that interests her) while she lays in bed. The requirement for her is she has to lay down (head on the pillow) and be quiet, still and calm while I read. If she gets up the book ends and I've had to do that a few times.      She still throws fits with screaming and still hits me now and then. I've helped her learn calm breathing techniques like in through the nose, out through the mouth slowly, etc. If she can't calm herself down she gets a time out for 5 minutes. She usually can't stay there for 5 minutes and the discipline escalates to taking toys/privileges away. She refuses to do her chores, opting to have her toys taken away when they're not picked up.      She sometimes gets so worked up (either while she's laughing or crying) I can't communicate with her, its like she doesn't hear me, no matter what I'm saying. Even if its "Do you want a special treat?" It's like the outside world is shut off. She does at some point almost every day.      She's complained quite a few times that she can't stop thinking about a certain thing (a part in a movie, a word, a picture of something) and it frustrates her. She complains that her brain wont stop or let her sleep at night. She gets frustrated because she says she "can't yawn right". I think she over-thinks it. She gets upset very, very easily.      I limit her sugar intake, watching not only candy but sugary drinks and foods as well. I feel like if she had one very engrossing, constructing activity after another to fill every minute of her day she would be okay, but that's not possible. I have to clean, cook, shower, etc.      I'm not a fan of meds so even if she does have ADD or ADHD I'd try techniques other than meds. Do you think she might have ADD? Is there anything I can do to help her keep from getting too out of control and, consequently, getting disciplinary actions? How do you deal with fits from a 5 year old?      Thank you so much for your answers in advance.
20090223102251AAp2fN3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Was my sister right to defend herself in this situation?	My little sister Amy whose 16 was at school Friday and a 14 year old guy grabbed her bum under her skirt. Well she turned round and hauled off and kicked him hard in the testicles she had heavy shoes on as she is a goth.       Anyway the guy fell down and cried. Amy then shouted at him calling him a little perv and told him that she hoped his balls popped. The teacher see this and pulled her into the office by which time the lad was puking on the floor.       My parents went to the school today (Monday). The principle decided that the one week suspension for Amy is appropriate, however the boy is also going to have a one week suspension put on his record although he is unlikely to be able to return to school during the weeks suspension due to the extent of his injuries.       The boy had surgery friday and the doctors repaired his left testicle that had been ruptured, although due to the damage sustained the testicle will not be able to produce any sperm. The boys right testicle had to be removed due to it having multiple ruptures.       The boys mother and my parents have agreed that this should be the end of the matter. Amy is not happy at being suspended as she feels that it was self defense and their were people who saw the incident that backed her story up.      I do agree with Amy in the respect that the boys injuries are as a direct result of his actions and that she should nt be held responsable for injuries he suffered.      1. Do you think she did the right thing?   2. Would your answer to question 1 be different if the boy did not suffer permanent damage?   3. What would you have done?   4. Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do?   5. Do you feel bad for the guy or do you think its his own fault and what he deserved?

20090223122613AAi7r2U	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Sex during pregnancy.?	I've read and have been told that it is alright to have sex while pregnant but I've also read that having sex helps induce labor. My husband is in the military and next month he will be gone all month. He will not be home until the beggining of April- my baby is due at the end of april but because he's already upside down and sitting VERY low- I'm already afraid of going into early labor. (not to mention most women on my side of the family give birth 2 weeks early just as I was 2 weeks early.) Both my husband and I have agreed to not have sex (or basically, him completely inside me) just incase it would cause me to go into early labor.PLUS I defanately don't want to give birth while he's away althought his major said if I did they would send him back home emidiately. If we have sex now, is there a chance of me going into labor too early? Is it best that we don't have sex until after he's back home when I KNOW he'll be around for the baby?

20090223114408AAGkde1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My Mom is being really mean to me?	I messed up in school.  I'm always late and I'm failing Biology and Economics.  Cs in everything else.  I never study, usually I'm up late playing XBox in my room or watching TV.  I basically just guess answers on tests, its that bad.  I've been keeping my bad grades a secret so far by hiding my report card, but I got caught when the school called, asking my Mom to come for a parent teacher conference.  I showed her the report card and she was pissed.  Economics I can pass if I get all As.  Biology I will still fail, so I'm going to summer school.        Mom took the TV and XBox out of my room.  She grounded me not only till the end of the school year, but the whole summer too!  That's over 6 months!          My grounding punishment includes staying in my room, with no TV, XBox, computer, or phone.  I'm not allowed to go out either.  I can read that's it.  I leave my room for meals, bathroom, and school, thats it.   + 2 hours of study a day   + an early bedtime of 9 PM weekdays (8PM Fridays and weekends because there is less schoolwork)      Last Friday I got home from school and Mom said "all right, now go to your room"  So I did and finished homework and studying.  Her coworker came over for dinner, and we ate at 6.  Then Mom tells me  "all right, now go to your room, bedtime at 8.  Say goodnight to Diane"        I was so humiliated.  That woman knows I'm being grounded!   Can't I be un-grounded if I promise to do better?  Mom told me she wants to teach me a hard lesson.  How is this punishment going to teach me anything?  I love my Mom but why is she being so mean to me?

Why do I have to be grounded the whole summer?  Summer school is punishment enough, plus it ends in July.  What will I do all day in my room during August?        2.  Why can't I watch a limited amount of TV after my homework is done?

20090223120503AAdK0EY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Guardians don't know how to punish troubled teen...?	My sister who just turned 13 has rebelled in almost any way you can think of. She drank, smoked, lied, cheat, steal. (She's a compulsive liar so when you ask her about anything she denies it, even when I have sat there and watch her do it.) Anything, most recently she stole something from one of my really good friends. I live with my grandparents while she stays with our dad. But she's over at our house more than anything, due to the fact that my dad is always working. She follows the footsteps of her mother and her oldest sister (once my step-mom and stepsister). Neither one of them have anything going for them. My dad doesn't punish her because it takes away from "off" time, since he's an only parent and working all the time. She's isn't mature enough to stay at home by herself.       Anyways what I'm getting at is that, it's put on my grandparent's to punish or she never learns. And they need ideas.       All electronics have been taken from her for a long while, so she can't be banned from that. She doesn't have a room here, so you can't lock her in her room. That wouldn't work anyways.

However, my aereolas are pretty dark. Has anyone been pregnant with a girl and had this area be dark? All other comments and thoughts would be greatly appreciated too.

He was doing great at first, now he’s throwing massive tantrums because he doesn’t want to stop playing to use the potty.       I put him in undies and he stays in those until bedtime. I take him every hour or two to use the potty and he screams at the top of his lungs in this high pitched scream. Ughhh!       This morning his diaper was completely dry so I knew to take him to the potty. He cried the whole way there and once he stood up, he whined a bit more than peed.       I feel like I’m being evil. Do you back off during high pitched screaming fits or do you keep on it? I just feel totally pushy….

I have a serious boyfriend that I have been with for 6 years. I know i can handle this but there is something huge standing in the way. I need help figuring out who is the father. My last period was on the 15th of January. I had sex with my boyfriend on the 30th and 31st. A week later, the 6th of Feb. I most likely had intercourse with a stranger. If i can be sure that it is my boyfriends baby I want to keep it 100%. If it is the strangers baby, I don't think i would be able to have it. It would just be too hard. I am prepared for the amount of backlash this question might get me but before you answer too harshly please note that the sex on the 6th of February was NOT consensual. Please help me answer the hardest question of my life.

20090223132342AAcJkOK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Need some cheering up?	Rough day today.  I know it's not the end of the world and people have a lot worse days than this.- but...  My husband's dog decided to use our family room as a bathroom this morning.  I found that after I took her outside to poop and on my way out to the doctor.  I had to clean that up while my daughter was hysterically crying.  Then we had to go to the pediatrician (which we were late for) to get my daughter's 6 month shots, just obviously wasn't easy.  I had to run to the supermarket to get 5 things and my daughter wouldn't go in her stroller so I had to carry her.  People saw me carrying her and trying to carry a basket with food in it and decided to cut in front of me and walk really slow.  I have a headache and my arms are killing me.  Now I came home and had to clean up after the dog again.  My daughter finally calmed down and fell asleep.  (First chance to sit all day.)      Again, I know it's not the end of the world and people have a lot worse days than this.      Anyone have a good/cute story to cheer people up?
20090223132458AAA52Ty	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How can I get these contractions going...?	Hello everyone. I am finally 37 weeks pregnant today with our 2nd baby. First I just want to say that I know the baby's going to come when he's ready, I'd just like to hear experiences from others.       When I was pregnant with our 1st child, I walked and had sex quite a few times and he came when I was 39 week and 5 days (: I don't really recall how much of each I did and I really want this baby to come when I'm 38 weeks. I'm feeling light menstrual cramping, lots of BH contractions,and lots of pressure.       How many minutes a day do you think I should be walking a day for the last few weeks to get things going? There's probably know accurate answer but what would you recommend? Thanks for answering (no rude answers please).      -Mommy to a 12 month old and 37 weeks pregnant with #2-

20090223132129AAIVCLm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How on Earth did I turn out this way?	I grew up in a dysfunctional family. My folks were married by arrangement. It didn't take 'em long to find that they didn't match one another. But by then they were parents. I was first born. I was born disabled, but dont look it or talk it. I've just got a whole bunch of invisible ones. Mom knew that u must treat a disabled kid normally, and have the same expectations of them, so they'd at least achieve close achievements as their counter parts. So she pushed me to my limit. Sometimes even past it. But even when I reached the brink, she'd keep pushing to no end. Dad would step in and stop her at that point, saying if I could do it, I would. Mom didn't believe him, citing my laziness. She said she didn't want me to b like my dad..& didn't like that our personalities are similar.  I am REALLY slow also. But Im functional thanks to mom's pushing. But each time I failed to meet her expectations, she'd put me down. Then she'd expect me to try again. Then put me down again. If I showed a glimmer of happiness, she'd get mad at me, saying there's no reason for me to be happy. Then when I cried she'd wonder y, & said crying is weakness, & I shouldn't cry due to her scoldings. I'm still not up to her expectations. I have nowhere near the ability of my counterparts. I'm still getting punished for it. I got blamed for everything my whole life, but pulled through with some resilience I had.      I think she did all this to toughen me up, so I'd have an easier time in marriage. But I was the same softie she despised, and as a result, my marriage failed. But she's still the same mean spirited person I knew. But now, I guess I've learned, & no matter what I do, I just feel like a bad person. Because I'm afraid she'll knock me down again if I try to genuinely feel good about myself.      In all this, where did I find my resilience? How did I find some good in me, whom my mom still can't find any goodness? Not a pity party, just curious. Knowing all this, I can't seem to find any insight, so just wondering if y'all could...that's all.

Alright so i have recently realized a habbit of one of my friends from school that I CANT FREKING STAND!      Every time i say something she like hangs on my every word.

And i was just like um.. i said it was okay      she always says "i thought you said this, i thought you said that"   and when i crack a joke she just dosent even laugh she just smiles a FAKE smile.      and overall she is kind of boring. we used to be better friends but i really think im starting not to like her and i dont know what to do about it.
20090223123417AAbplQ5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Tracking temps on Fertility Friend?	I just started tracking my temps with Fertility Friend.  I noticed that when I put in the temps, it is fine.  When I enter the temp for the following day, the prior day's mark becomes a hollow circle rather than solid point.  The site says this means "inaccurate data" but I can't find any more information to help.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong...!      I know many of you use the site and wondering if you could give me any hints/pointers/explanations?  Is it because this is my first time using it? Could it be the varying times (6:30a; 7:30a; 4:40a)? Am I entering the temps wrong (to the hundredth - i.e. 96.79 - should I be rounding to the tenth, i.e. 96.8)? It seems to round automatically...
20090223123225AAf94Wh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Doctor frustration!! And what is first visit w/ Reproductive Endocrinologist like?	Okay ladies, I am sooooo...mad!  I made an appt. with a Reproductive Endocrinologist and I made the appt. 2 months ago, and today was the first available appt..  I left very early to get there and my husband changed his work schedule to attend the appt. with me.  On the way there we got a flat tire....so my husband got out changed the tire and we were on our way.  I called the office and said I think we are going to be about 15 minutes late because we got a flat ont he way and they said no problem go ahead and come in.  We get there fill out the paper work very quickly sice we ended up being 10 mins. late.  Then the nurse calls me and says the doctor will not see you because you were late, I explained what happened and how I called and they were like nope doctor said re-schedule????? I am so mad! It was 45 minutes away....      So they were able to squeeze me in for tomorrow but said I might have to wait awhile as they were doing me a favor of squeezing me in???      I am so mad, would you even go back to this doctor?  The only reason I am even considering it is because he comes very highly recommended and is hard to get in to see in the first place.        What do you think? Should I go or find a new doctor...and what is the first appt. going to be like?

20090223124342AAgHSDX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Two periods- One month?	I got my period on 2.14 it was over on 2.19 it was normal, clots, cramps. I always have one day of brown spotting " old blood" the day after, I had that. Then my cm went normal and when i would check my cervix it would be completely clean. Then on 2.22 when I woke up to use the bathroom there was light pink spotting on the tp. The spotting lasted all day, going from the color light pink, brownish red, to red back to spotting, my boyfriend and I didn't have sex that day or anything. We did have sex last night though and I was bleeding lightly for like 5 min. then it went away this morning it seems like i've gotten a light period back, Not just spotting but a light period, My normal period always has small clots but this is just blood, sometimes its light pink other times it bright red. What could this be? I'm not having any cramps, no burning or itching or smelling down there. Could I have gotten pregnant?
20090223123020AAf9bjQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Is this the month am i pregnant?	This is my 2nd round of clomid i started taking it on Feb 7th for 5 days my husband and i have baby danced everyday starting Feb. 7th no joke every day. I found a clomid ovulation calculater on the website babymed.com and it said  that i would ovulate between Feb.16 through the 21 i took a ovulation test on friday and its was POSITIVE. Now my question is ..i know the egg can only live up to 36 hours now if i ovulated on friday and didnt get pregnant should i already have my period. How soon after you ovulate and dont get pregnant should you get your period. I havent gotten mine yet so im hoping this is the month we ahve been ttc for 2 years now!!
20090223124957AAYiEfY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Child-free by choice?	I'm almost 20, and I've known since I was twelve that I never want kids.  I LOVE kids, just never want to be a mother.      The thing that bothers me is literally everyone I know telling me that one day I will change my mind.  I appreciate the fact that I could, remain openminded, and think that people should share their opinions with me.  However I do tend to expect them to be openminded to the fact that I'm making a very valid lifestyle choice and they don't seem to acknowledge that this could (and will almost definitely) be my final choice.      Anyone else encounter this, and how do you deal with it?  Thank you ever so much!  Also, do you think there is a good chance of me finding a partner who shares my belief?  I'm hoping to find a really nice guy who doesn't want kids either.

I've done well so far, but this last chunk is not going well.

He's at home since he broke his leg (his doctor recommended). And he has been having sleep problems, he has a long leg cast, he has to be with it for the next week or maybe 2. We were giving him pain meds at night but doctor told us to stop giving these because he can't be taking pills for a long time but now he can't sleep well.    And another question, the doctor said that my son has to relearn to walk again when the cast is off, he won't walk for a month. I think is better to exercise the leg to regain muscle strength.

20090223131324AAHwssx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Pregnant or not taking 50mg Clomid?	I'm 27yrs old   My dr. said I have PCOS because I have irregular periods and weight gain. I started getting irregular periods in May of 08 and didn't get checked unti'l August 08.   We didn't start trying to conceive unti'l August of 08, but dr. said I wasn't ovulating. Then I had to change to a OBGYN because the Gyn wasn't much help. I went to a OBGYN in December 08. She first prescribed the progesterone pills to help get my period then on 21st day I went to get blood drawn to see if I ovulated. I didn't so now I got the pills again and had period on February 4th and this time She gave me clomid 50mg to take days 5-9 after period. so it's my first time taking clomid.   I had intercourse days 12,14,16,18 as dr. suggested. Now i'd been having stomach fluttery feelings I called the dr. and nurse said I might be ovulating but now I have sore breasts & sleepy. I don't know if I can be pregnant or not and since I have irregular periods I don't know if I should wait for my blood test tomorrow but I won't get results in about a week. I would like to take a pregnancy test but too soon! I need some advice of what to do?    When to take pregnancy test?   Has anyone had same problem?   Please wish me luck and give me some baby dust.. thanks :)
20090223130007AALoVQ7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why would a parent stop talking to their child?	After a "family" trip this summer, my dad has not bothered to talk to me. While on the trip, an incident occurred with my sister and her daughter (and lack of discipline). My dad blamed me for the situation, and treated me like garbage. I have to admit my dad and sister are completely lazy. We stayed with my aunt, and without asking I cleaned up the kitchen after them, did everyone's laundry. I stayed out of people's way, babysat the kids while we were in the pool every day while everyone else socialized completely ignoring the four young ones in the pool under the age of 6.      Anyway, my dad said some really nasty things while on the trip. I am one of those people who will stand for what I believe in, but also be respectful. My dad is not one of those people, mostly he will play the pity-party game and have everyone feel sorry for him. Where we went, the only things people would talk about are gossip about others. I prefer to talk about things or ideas, such as news events, anything health related, heck anything really. My dad told me the first day that "no one wanted to hear about that health crap." However, my sister, who is older and I never thought of her as "the favorite" went on and on for 7 days about her jewelry sales, and how much money she would make, and what bracket it would put her on. At first I was supportive, but it got old fast.      Anyways, the day we got back, my dad has not called me once. Out of three siblings, my brother and I are doing well, never in debt, trying to live our life as best as we can. I went to college and am a grad student, am a full time teacher, and never ask for ANYTHING from my dad. My sister, however, doesn't work, stays at home in a pig stye (my dad's words), and always is asking my dad for favors. She is upside down in debt, and is always needing to be bailed out.      I don't understand how my dad can simply ignore his own child. He's done this before (we've gone years without speaking), and he apologizes but does it again! My heart is broken. I'm 26- old enough to know he'll never change, but wondering what else can I do in my life to make him proud?!? Doing well in school, being self-sufficient, none of that matters. My sister keeps getting support, help, and love from him and she never helps him out.      What can I do? Should I just let it go? It's a habitual cycle that he does. Heck, my brother got in a serious motorcycle accident and my dad NEVER called him to see how he was doing!!! (By the way, my brother and I are "real", and my sister is "half"- she has a different mom)

20090223125723AADpXDv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Condom broke...could I get pregnant?	So last night I had sex with my boyfriend and he came inside me...and pulled out to see that the condom had broken.       I was on the first placebo day of my first month of Alesse; the prescription says that you should use condoms for the first week, but you're protected afterwards. I take them almost perfectly...mostly within the same hour every day, although I was late taking it by an hour twice (so, within 2 hours of the same time). I was on Tricyclen-Lo for 3 months before that so I'm not entirely new to birth control.      I usually get my period on the 3rd or 4th day of the placebo week so I'm not late yet...but should I get the morning after pill anyways? I've taken it once before, about 6 months ago and before I started the Tricyclen....but I've heard that it's not good to take it at the same time as regular BC?

20090223131819AAWBwqU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I am a little confused on my pregnancy dates?	My LMP was Dec. 9th 2008, I ovulated around Christmas and at my first prenatal appointment on Feb. 12, my OB report through the ultrasound showed that I was 8 weeks 4 days… I should have asked but does this mean that the baby was 8 weeks 4 days and I was 10 weeks 4 days pregnant OR that the baby was 6 weeks 4 days and I was 8 weeks 4 days pregnant? Because the fetus age is 2 weeks different right? I am only asking because for one my next appointment isn’t for a couple more weeks and two I was trying to do a week by week pregnancy calendar online but with my EDD of Sep. 20th I keep getting different week to week dates. Like for example on www.amazingpregnancy.com I put in my dates and is says that the week of Dec. 21st is my first week, second trimester starts on March 15th and third trimester starts on June 28th… I can’t remember what the other site was but it wait that I would be in my second trimester on March 22nd
20090223132048AAwmiUd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	This question's popped up more than once, but it's about the pregnancy issue.?	My girlfriend and I broke up after 6 months or so, and then she told me she thought she was pregnant about...2 months after that. I told her I'd support her in what ways I could. The thing is; I'm an actor, and I don't stay still very long. I'm busy 'round the clock with classes, scripts, and working part-time. This girl has told me time and time again, that unless I marry her, I don't care at all about her or her child. When I said that was ridiculous and that I did care, she told me that I never cared about her at all, and that when she kills herself, the suicide would be entirely my fault. She said to stop trying to be nice about it because I'm such a prick and have no direction with my life and that it's such a waste, with none of my efforts making a difference.      I spoke to my friends for advice on the matter of the supposed pregnancy at the time, and she flipped out, claiming it had nothing to do with anyone else and that I'm insensitive to her by asking for help because I wasn't sure what to do. She said not to ask anyone else because none of them are ever going to do anything with their pathetic excuses for lives. So, by trying to help, just not in the extremely inconvenient ways she wants, I'm proving to her that "all guys really are the same." In the end, she said to get the &^%$ out of her life and stay there.      So...a couple of days ago during this constant struggle of back and forth "Any child that spawns from you is the biggest mistake I would ever give birth to," to "Oh, but I love you and I want to keep it, because if you leave me, it'll be the only piece of you left." She comes and tells me that my presence near the child would be fatal because no one makes her want to kill herself in the most brutal way on a daily basis like I do.      I keep telling her I can help. I keep telling her that I didn't hook up with random whores like she thinks I do when I don't answer the phone (when I'm at my job, I can't. She knows this.) If her life is so ruined because of me, and yet she claims she loves me and that she's just having mood swings.      I guess....WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THIS? Not to sound cruel, but this can't be a mood swing if we've been at this every day. Do I really want to trust the child will be okay with an emotionally/mentally unstable mother? I've read other articles about the whole "broken home" "man up" "responsibility" "God says so" and all those other answers. But...I'm afraid she'll kill the baby. I'm not kidding. I'm 100% serious about that statement. Her sister left home because of the madness at home, and her mother's always out on business trips, so I don't know if she'll be okay when she's home alone for awhile. Every time we talk about it, she tries to get me to either stay with her, or else I have to kill the child myself. I was completely taken aback by this. I suggested adoption, but let's just say that didn't fly too well.      How much further should I try to negotiate this with her? I'm worried about the well-being of the child... I had no idea she would react like this. I suppose, if it helps the child, I can just do what she wants and hope I come out alive...quite literally. Even if she's a tiny bit volatile, she's still a girl who needs help. And whether or not I've the patience of a saint with her may or may not be my own bane.      Please, I've heard the religious side of this ordeal many times, but I'd like to also hear the civil side of this debate.         P.S. If this note offends or violates anyone or anything, I apologize. I just really..really need people to grasp this and suggest something. Am I being heartless for not marrying this girl?

Its due tomorrow and I waited til last minute to do it.

Also,we were supposed to site where we got our info from,and a couple of the people I couldn't find the author so I put the chief editor. Is that ok,and could I still use the info? And lastly,how do I make it colorful?I've got regular pencils,a hot pink fine tipped  sharpie,a blue and a pink highlighter,and blue,black,green,and red pens. Thanks!

20090223135915AAytHHu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you think of this man?	What do you think of a man a Green Card (Ex Green Card) holder or a US National with a foreign passport?  He leaved the country to avoid dealing with the USA, CSA Child Support Agency.  Any lawyer will tell you that you will never get any child support order enforced in the other country.  His lawyer or his own father told him to do that.        If the American mother had the same mentally is an Italian woman, he would have be able to make a parenting plan that most American man consider fair.  As a result the baby daughter will never see her father and her mother will not get any money from him and it is 100 % mothers fault for being selfish.
20090223140202AAJxeaE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why is this the case?	The divorce rate for American men who marry American women: 57%   (officially). But since the figures from several states (including   California) are excluded, the true national divorce rate is likely   closer to 65%. The divorce rate in California is over 70%.      The divorce rate for American men who marry foreign women: approximately   20%.      So you can marry an American woman and have a close to two-thirds chance   of getting divorced, or you can marry a foreign woman and have at least   a 75% chance of success.

Other wise he would have stayed and the financial support he would have given the American mother would be the amount that average Italian women would be satisfied with.

20090223133515AAn1Tdp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you think?  Does it seem that more and more children are growing up in broken homes?	I was actually born into a broken home.....My mom was 21 when she had me and she made my father stop seeing me when I was 4 months old.      (My grandmother told her it would be in my best interest because he was young and didn't have a good job)      Well I hated that.   My mom worked all the time and my grandparents basically were with me all the time.      My mom then got married and though it seemed a picture perfect family....it wasn't.  I was her child.   When they had my sister I was pushed to the background.   As so many kids are it seems.         I now have a good relationship with my biological father and he is a good guy.....and he wanted to be part of my life all along.      I see a lot of kids and read about a lot of broken homes (weather it be divorce...parents never married.....etc)      And its just so sad.      I mean I needed my mom and my dad and I didn't have that....I really didn't have either.      I see so many kids getting in trouble because mom or dad has to work all day and they don't know what there kids are doing.      I'm just grateful my kids won't go through that.   My husband and I both came from a similar situation and we are very much in love.   And we want our kids to have both of us no matter what as long as we are living.      And I am confident we have a happy home....      But I know sometimes things don't work out....and some kids aren't that lucky.      Its just really sad.

20090223134316AAk9M3F	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy symptoms but not pregnant?	I have had an IUD since February of last year and my last period ended Feb 6th of 09. The last 2.5ish weeks I've been experiencing pregnancy symptoms. Tender breasts, nauseous, cravings, dizziness (which I experienced during my first pregnancy) and cramping. I took a pregnancy test and it came back negative. Any ideas on what the problem could be?       I wasn't sure if even though I've never experienced these problems with Mirena before if a year down the road I could develop a hormone reaction? According to their website it says any of these symptoms should develop within the first three months but I was wondering if something similar has occurred with anyone else?

20090223133740AAk8Z1i	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Another ? about a scary movie child/children?	lol ok i know i asked about a similar ? a little earlier but i have 2 more movies i wondered if anybody knew about.      the 1st is a movie first filmed in black and white and later remade the 80s (?)  its about a little homicidal girl who lived in an apt. building. she killed her overweight neighbor women by setting her up to fall down the stairs b/c the woman told he no about something. the girl beat a student while on a class field trip w/ her tap shoes leaving half moon shaped welts on him. she had stolen his prize ribbons and medals and he threatened to tell. she put her shoes down the burn chute so no1 would find them. in the end the girls mom knew she was evil so she tryed to kill her with sleeping pills then after the girl fell asleep the mom shot herself. i think there is 2 variations where in 1 the girl dies and in the other she doesn't. any ideas?      The next is a lifetime movie from the 90s where a couple in there 30s adopt a 7 yr (?) old girl and her 2 or 3 yr old brother. The girl was molested as a tiny girl and in turn molests her brother. there is also a scene where she sits on her new gpas lap around xmas time and she grabs his penis and he sternly puts her down and scolds her. the girl also kills baby birds in the tree outside her and her bro's bedroom window. she stabs the family dog who is black and white w/ needles until he bleeds and eventually bites her. the movie ends after the girl pushes her brother down the basement stairs then folows and beats him almost to death in the basement.      any 1 know anything about these movies?

20090223140647AAfZ2js	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How much punishment do you think parents should give their children?	For me honestly, I feel that children should get spanked at the very least. I also feel that just a light smack (not a full swing) across the mouth is warranted for mouthing or profanity, and something similar to the back of the head.    All these parents that say you shouldn't do anything to your children are just ridiculous. Have you seen these recent teenagers? Most of them are terrible, disrespectful and just plain ignorant. More so than previous generations. Things like hip hop and the screamo  music don't exactly teach good values.   There was a survey of sorts in one of my colleges classes once. The professor asked how many of us were spanked when we were younger and almost all of the bright students said they were.   I'm not saying beat your child, but a spanking or a little tap to the face won't ruin your child. I turned out fine and actually matured quickly.

20090223133109AAYgMN2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Young Teens having sex?	Ok this is just my opinion you can put your thoughts down.      This is where young teen start to get their sexual feelings boys/girls and make many mistakes like having sex protected or not and yes many end up pregnant. We all have done it. There is slim chance that there is any virgins that make it to college many of us never listened to our parents of not having sex so why are we yelling at these kids not to have sex when we had a hard time not to do it ourselves and yes they should be on BC . Some are still trying to understand how to use Birth Control and they are 15-17 yrs and they end up pregnant because its not 100% safe neither is condoms even though they are easy to use . And when they come up here on yahoo answers because they are scared that they might be pregnant we put them down. Why us girls had many pregnancy scares I'm sure or never really though of being pregnant Then we get mad at parents when they cant watch their children 24/7 to make sure they are not having sex when the only thing the parents  can do is give their best advice and hope they will take it like some of our parents did when we didn't take any of it.   Why can't we try to be there for them when we have been there ourselves      That's all :o)

I could just be holding out a lot of hope here, but I was curious if anyone has ever had this pregnancy symptom?   I've had a really weird month this month, and noticed that I've had acne breakouts, which I don't normally get. It's not all nasty and gross looking, but I've been getting a LOT more than I usually do. Has anyone ever experienced this in early early pregnancy? And no, I don't know if I'm pregnant yet, the earliest I could test would be at the end of the week.

20090223133755AAu8IDv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Ovulation and implantation?	Hi. This is all of my details that I asked yesterday.    Hi. I was on provera so that I would have a period. I started Feb 5th., and ended Feb 10th. I have also been on provera for about 6 wks. According to an ultrasound on Feb 11th, I would ovulate between 14th thru the 22nd. On sat,the 14th, I had some cramping with thick cm. On sun, cramping and pain with creamy white cm. Mon very mild pain, with just sticky to dry cm. I was dry until the 21st, then I had a glob of what looked like snot about the size of a quarter. Later that day I got 4 sharp pains in my right side. I also felt nauseated and felt like my face was very warm, but the rest of my body had chills. I appreciate all of the answers. My hubby and I are ttc # 2 for 2 years and after a miscarriage.      We had sex on the 12th, 14th, 16th(but didn't finish), 20th.   The more I read I find out new things. My question is could I have ovulated on Sun, and the pain I had Sun been implantation cramps? I went and bought a $1.00 hpt because I figured it was way too early to get a + hpt, and took it this morning. It looks like there is a line where the + would be. It is so faint. If this is true, I would be 8 dpo. What do you all think. When could i get a +?

20090223134109AAqKxPM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How to put the letter sounds together?	My 2.25 year old knows all letters and sounds. She reads few words correctly too. She has been knowing the letter sounds since long. She is not able to put the sounds together and pronounce the words. I know it is early to do that but I am still asking for advices as I feel she really needs that at this moment. I read her a lot as she is so much dependent on me at this time. I think she wants to do that on her own, but she can not so she seeks me so often. She wants me to switch off the gas-stove and come sit by her, read her stories. But then who will do cooking for her(and for us)?      I taught my elder one how to read at age 4. She had started writing a bit by 4. So I just gave her workbooks and with little practice she started reading at age 4.25. I must mention that she is a wondeful reader and is doing amazing at her school(Now Grade 1). Elder one loves reading so much that she makes sure to do that for one hour each day. Probably that is also one source of inspiration(and a bit of problem) for younger one. I want Reading to be quick for younger one because that way they will have reading time together with their own books. My elder one does read to younger but mostly for 10 minutes and then goes to her own books. They play a lot together. Younger one is very mature and elder one is very energitic so they get along very nicely. Somehow 'Not able to Read' is coming on the way. I don't want to be pushy but I just want to make it easier. However I know some kids need parents even after they start reading on their own, but I feel that won't be too much and I can make myself available surely for sometime

When i was in 7th grade i am now 22 i dislocated my hip in a soccer game.I was pulled out of the game and my hip was set back in place later that day, i wasn't aloud to do anything for 2 weeks. Before i became pregnant i would get pains and things and they would hurt pretty bad in my hip. I have had them since that happened. But i was wondering would it be possible to give a vaginal birth with this. I have not yet told my doctor. However my husband and i are really afraid that this will hurt me later on or that i will have to have an emergency c section. Sometimes when we did it i would get hip pains and if there is lot of pressure on my hips i begin to almost cry. so i was just wondering if i would be better off with a c section or if i could even try giving a vaginal birth?

As time has gone by, she has gone from sleeping through the night, very happy,lovely baby, to waking constantly, never happy, always crying and wanting to be on me constantly. I realise that she is teething, and I understand that this will make her quite uncomfortable, she has been teething since she was 3 mos. old, cut two teeth, top two are now coming in. Other than that, no other problems like ear infections, illness, constipation, etc.  Nothing seems to make her happy for more than 20 mins and I am going to go nuts with all this constant crying. Is this normal teething behavior. What was your experience. Been to doctor several times, and everything is good. Please don't be rude either, theres no need for that. i just want to hear what others have experienced|????? HELP!!!!!!!!!

My kids don't have any other family, they don't have a dad so it hurts them when my husband spends individual time with his kids and even collective time with his kids but only includes mine on occasion (I know that his kids are entitled to special time with their dad but my kids are just feeling bad), I mean my kids are not the best behaved but they are not animals, even at family gatherings my hubby's nieces and nephews don't play with my kids as much as they do his, what can I do?

20090223140607AArnJxw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My friend is 14, she told me she had sex?	man this is stupid.. and very complicated, this is a hard question to answer...      my friend is 14 and shes a girl. i AM her best mate. i look after her in anyway i can. she has been going out with this boy for a week and 3 days. they didnt see eachother for a week.. becuase the school holidays. in theory, she has known her new boyfriend for 3 days.       basically, she told me this morning she was going round his tonight and they were goin to have sex. in first lesson, i convinced her and almost had her in tears telling her why she couldnt do it at this age. i thought it was the right thing to do. after she saw him at break, she had changed her mind completly. and wanted to. i felt like slapping her beacuse nothing i told her sunk in. i kept texting her and ringin her saying no its a bad idea... but no she didnt listen       later on tonight, i found out she did. she used a condom. i felt so sick wen she told me about it. i dont want her to do it again. and if i find out she has. thats it, im not being her friend.      Now she is a very atractive girl and very mature for her age. let me tell you why she did it to him and not any other of her boyfriends...      she was going out with another boy for 9 months until she moved school and saw a new person. she immediatly dumped her boyfriend and went out with the new boy. he uses her as a sex object already at 14, and i think its sick. he uses her but he dusnt care bout her. but she loves him so much, shes under a spell.      this is sick, stupid and agaisnt the law.   i want to know a way to make sure she dosnt do it again and bes more sensible. but i think there is no way to convince her. she just says im butting in.

20090223143057AAFQrYH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is this normal or bad parenting?	I had a houseguest come to visit last week with an 8 week old baby. She repeatedly threw dirty diapers in my kitchen trash, I was mortified by this. It made my whole house stink and I was emptying it every few hours. Also, when we went out of the house for dinner or a day trip, she would forget to bring food for the baby and never changed her diaper when we were away from the house. I don't have children yet myself and I realize parenting is not easy, but is this a sign of bad parenting or what? I just feel bad for the poor baby.

20090223144342AA2n9aG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Has something like this ever happened to you?	I was at the mall with my daughter yesterday and when I went to pay for my things, the cashier did the usual "omg your babies so cute! how old is she??" routine. Then she asked me how old I was. I'm used to getting that when I'm out with Aisling because I look younger than I am. So I told her that I am 21.   And then she said "Oh okay, if you were any younger than that I would have thought really badly about you and would have had to say something about it"   I was in total shock for a second. I wanted to punch her!! Once I got my composure I just smiled at her and said "Well its a good thing for both of us that I'm not younger then isn't it?" And then she had the nerve to look offended at what I had just said!   Has something like this ever happened to you? I know it was a first for me! People usually just tell me I'm lucky I look so young. Then they go back to talking to Aisling.

20090223143903AAIvM02	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you think of this man?	What do you think of a man a Green Card (Ex Green Card) holder or a US National with a foreign passport? He leaved the country to avoid dealing with the USA, CSA Child Support Agency. Any lawyer will tell you that you will never get any child support order enforced in the other country. His lawyer or his own father told him to do that.       If the American mother had the same mentally is an Italian woman, he would have be able to make a parenting plan that most American man consider fair. As a result the baby daughter will never see her father and her mother will not get any money from him and it is 100 % mothers fault for being selfish.       There are American woman in the US that do things the same way as in Sicily Italy, and most American man don’t ever have to go to family court ever.  Many of those women are not even of Italian decent.  Many of them are born in America to American parents.

Ok, so my dad gave me the sex talk today and he said that if I ever need condoms just come to him because he doesn't want a 15 year old boy going into the super marked and buying them. But meanwhile my step-mom was listening and after she said to me and my dad that it is unacceptable for a 15 year old boy to need condoms. She said that I won't need them yet because I shouldn't even be sexually active. My dad replied "I would rather have him sexually active with protection than have him doing it unsafe.". They got into a pretty big fight and I want to know what you think about this. So what do you think? Who was right, my dad or my step-mom? And also, would you be comfortable at 15 asking your dad to get you condoms?
