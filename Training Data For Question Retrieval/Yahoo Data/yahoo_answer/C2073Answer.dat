8yE2sYGeaa	The real trick it to get enough exposure for them|`|zDQIPFH2aa	If you want more, but serious answers, there are several ways to improve the chances.<br>  <br>  1. Write very detailed, complete sentence, correctly spelled questions. They are much more likely to be picked.<br>  <br>  2. Ask during the high user times. For the USA 6-10pm New York time.<br>  <br>  3. Don't give a lot of extra not needed data and don't write speeches in the added details. That turns people off.<br>  <br>  4. If you are looking at questions on personal issues, this is probably not the site to get serious answers. Make the questions less about you and more about people in general.|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	ask interesting questions is all i got to say.|`|4TiWZLKXaa	Give more details.  What are your questions?

Wordpress is at the top of the list for people who run a web site and want to incorporate blogging or who want to do "multi-user blogging". Blogger is at the top of the list for people who would rather have a service control the primary web site functions and provide automated tools/features (i.e. developer hosted blogging). Wordpress can also be used as a developer host.<br>  <br>  Investigate the following services. Pick one service, register if necessary, and start writing a blog entry through their web site.<br>  <br>  Blogger/Blogspot (<a href="http://blogger.com" rel="nofollow">http://blogger.com</a> ), Wordpress (<a href="http://wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://wordpress.com</a> ), Livejournal (<a href="http://livejournal.com" rel="nofollow">http://livejournal.com</a> ), Vox (<a href="http://vox.com" rel="nofollow">http://vox.com</a> ), Yahoo!

wNWEdOjUaa	Here's an answer to your question.<br>  <br>  Well, you can always answer questions, but you can aslo keep those points and become a Top Contributor or a very high skilled answerer. (as some people might say) just read this message to you below, it might help. I answered this answer to a person before and I hope it will help you like it helped him too.<br>  ______________________________...<br>  <br>  If you want to "up" your chance of getting best answer, don't answer questions which you think you are incapable of providing the best answer for, which might sound kind of strict, but it's the truth.<br>  <br>  If someone asks, for example, do you own a car or a truck, and you answer "truck", the chances of you getting best answer is slim, so, try to avoid them.<br>  <br>  Also try avoid answering questions where the question will produce similiar answers.<br>  <br>  And if you don't know the answer to a question someone has posted, try not to answer it. If you do, and type "I don't know what you are talking about" or something similiar, you are highly likely to NOT get a best answer.<br>  <br>  If you read a question about something you are very knowledgeable about, or you instantly come up with a very clever response, answer the question AFTER checking to make certain that no one else has already provided the same answer. If so, it will be hard for the asker to vote and might send it to voting and then you'll never know who gets best answer. But of course, only if it's you.<br>  <br>  Well, I try to be humerous when I can. I also try to only answer questions with answers I believe the asker will find very cunning, informative or unique other than other answers.<br>  <br>  So really what I'm saying is to try not to waste your answers on silly "yes" or "no" or "i don't know" answers. And also, be different than other answers and answerers. And try to follow your own path instead of following others. Try to be in sink into a categorey, too. And FINALLY, of course, try to be cunning, smart and very knolwedgable about you answers and take them very seriously, well, if the question is very serious of if you are very serious about answering questions, also.

Do you really want it?  If so, slack up on your answering and let your best answers "catch" up with the number of questions you have asked.  This will take a while because there are a lot of open questions out there.  Too many people don't close their questions out.<br>  <br>  You could go to DATE link when answering and hurry up and answer those questions that are about to close out.   Or you could go to questions that have 0 or 1 answer, this will give one an advantage of being selected best answer by default.|`|lAj8UNcoaa	Dear Penny,  try answering questions that have no responses.

I just asked this question myself. I always go to the search bar to search for questions and the question I always look for doesn't show up. Or If I search for other questions, it says like 5 pages available but only shows 1 or 2 questions. Hopefully this problem won't last long.

MAHgvLcIaa	There`s Draft. But you have to give it time to save. In your particular email you were in progress with. The Yahoo Mail program didn`t get time to save.
8152c716ea73e0dbfa6a499b01d9f53daa	Did u check the {sent} folder to be sure it wasn't sent?  If it's not there then no, you can't get it back.|`|unesaO7saa	no|`|7b7ceb08e301484e15f773010c165ceaaa	i doubt it<br>  try draft folder<br>  worth a try<br>  in fact check all folders

nu8PTg3Oaa	Did you do any kind of merging of accounts or sub accounts.  Merging can cause problems.  You may have done this some time ago.  Your sub accounts hang around for a long time and unless you re-activate them, they eventually die and become inaccessible.  Look up sub account merging in help.  You may have created yourself a monster so be aware.<br>  <br>  Also, anytime you are going to try to do something like that (merging etc).  I think this is in mail, but put your account contacts etc out onto a CD or your hard disk so it can be reloaded if need be even under a new account name.  It just creates a spreadsheet file of them like a Microsoft excel spreadsheet that can be read back in for uploading.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are using your primary account for example in Yahoo messenger, sometimes when you bring up an IM window to chat with somebody, notice down toward the bottom that you get a choice as to what account you are communicating to them with and it can be changed.  <br>  <br>  Also, in the preferences of Yahoo messenger, you can turn on or off and change the accounts / sub accounts you will work with or communicate by when in the whole messenger session.  Make sure that is what you think or want it to be.  When you first contact somebody and they save you as a contact, they save your account info as part of your identity on their system.  If you don't match that, your communication may not work.  Check, check, check and recheck.
MAHgvLcIaa	In the new Yahoo! Mail, you don’t do this with your browser anymore. Now, just change your<br>  character encoding setting right in Yahoo! Mail! <br>  <br>  Here’s how: <br>  <br>  In the toolbar, click More Actions and select Set Encodings. <br>  From the list that appears, select the encoding that matches the message’s content. <br>  Note: Only one character encoding set may be viewed at a time. And in this case, changing your<br>  browser’s encoding setting will not work. <br>  <br>  Or in the old Traditional = Select any email where the header information is displayed, but there<br>  is nothing in the<br>  "body" of the message where you would expect to find text, etc.<br>  Move your mouse to the area of the expected "body" of the message and right-click...on<br>  the menu that appears, click on "Encoding"...on the menu that appears, if "Auto Select"<br>  has a check mark, leave it as is...if not click "Auto Select"; then this menu will<br>  disappear...right click again in the "body" to cause the same menu to display again...then<br>  click on "Western European (Windows)"...you should now be able to view the "body" of<br>  all messages that you couldn't view before...obviously, if the problem somehow occurs<br>  again, do the same procedure described above again. I have no idea how or why these<br>  settings get "changed" or "corrupted" after everyday use, but apparently they sometimes<br>  do.

eRVRWwkBaa	20 hours later but here's my answer.<br>  It has been 11 months since we lost my grandmother to cancer. And we are a close family because of my grandparents. My grandfather left us in 1993,he went to bed and left us just like that. My grandmother caught a cold and we were fearing pneumonia. Then 3 weeks later,we are told she has about 3 months at best to live. And wouldn't you know it; for this the doctor is right. What hurt too was that the doctor told my grandmother when she was alone and the family were still en-route to meet her at the hospital that day. I loved my grandmother dearly and one night after I cried some and just couldn't sleep I found Yahoo Answers. And yes, I'm still grieving.|`|50UbJp14aa	No i am not grieving

Questions with no answers are auto-deleted after four days.<br>  <br>  Questions are deleted when they violated community guidelines and are reported by at least 2 users.<br>  Violations include chatting ( not seeking knowledge but starting a conversation), soliciting ( asking users to do something either in addition to or instead of just answering your question), profanity, not following the question/answer format, not posing a legitimate question, placing the question in the wrong category.  There are alot of different violations but chat and soliciting are probably the biggest offenses.|`|WXSL7e9Aaa	Because Either Yahoo deletes it for you, <br>  or someone thought it was offensive or w/e<br>  and felt like reporting it to yahoo.<br>  <br>  happens to me all the time.<br>  hate it.<br>  <br>  <br>  im sorry hon|`|AA11273546	Cant think of any other reason why,but Happy Birthday anyway......|`|i7fSpq4Yaa	I can not think of any other reason why it would be deleted besides it being old and never being answered.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	If it lasted for 4 days without an answer then that is why it was deleted.If a Q is reported and is outside community guidelines then it will be deleted straight away if reported by more than one person.
AA12165015	Messenger "9" 1st version was in Beta (testing) form. The newest version is not, But it's not working well either. Stick to 8.1 until they work out the Bugs. Including people using 8.1 trying to message ones with 9 or reverse they are having compatibility problems; like text not showing,pictures not showing. It shuts down on Vista users , not allowing people to log in.Web cams do not always work. Many things do not work or are missing that YM 8.1 has.

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Sounds like your account was suspended. Did you receive any kind of a violation notice or suspension notice? One BAD violation or an accumulation of lesser violations will cause your YA account to be suspended, usually permanently, unless you win an appeal.

YG8hR182aa	Actually, contrary to what the first person said, being a good person person doesn't make you a good Christian.  There are good people in the world who don't believe in God.  In fact, the Bible says that "Not by works" is no man allowed into Heaven.  Being a CHRISTian means being a Christ-follower.  Believing that he once lived, and died for YOU, so that you and I may both live.  If we believe that He died for us, and that He is our Saving Grace, you are a Christian.  Your desire to become more like Christ will eventually make you a better person, but being a better person doesn't make you a Christian, does that make sense?<br>  <br>  Being a Christian is NOT always easy.  Jesus himself had to carry his own cross to his own execution for goodness sakes.  But He did it, because He knew God was in control.  For us, when things get to  hard, we have to find comfort in knowing that He isn't going to give us more than we can handle.  And the best part is?  He knows we are human.  He doesn't expect us to be perfect.  He has boundless grace, and endless mercy, for the times that we need it most.  It that a safety net that we should use when we dont feel like doing the right thing?  Of course not.  But we do our best, we do the right thing, we keep our eyes on God, and if we stumble....He is there to catch us.<br>  <br>  Being a Christian means realizing that there is an extraordinary amount of hope in this world because of who He is.  This world is an ocean, we are the swimmers, and He is the lifeboat.|`|b59YRi5Yaa	I know how hard it is and how confused and alone you feel. I felt the same not to long ago. I was raised a Jehovah's Witness but i never really tried to listen and i just felt like a failed christian, but i wasn't! i just didn't ask for guidance. they help me and my faith so much and now im so spiritual others look up to me! they answer any question from the word of god using the bible and bible literature! it truly is an amazing thing finding the truth and having caring people help you on your time and at your own pace!  I strongly consider contacting a Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall this week! I Absolutely assure you any Jehovah's Witness at ANY kingdom hall will warmly welcome you in and help you in what ever way you might possibly need. Please just give it a shot.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best!<br>  April<br>  sculder567@yahoo.com|`|P4kXX0vBaa	going to church doesnt make you a christian, being a good person makes you a good christian. being nice to others and doing whats best, going to church is more for religion, anyone can be a good christian if they want to be a good person =)

It is a few years old so the price is probably a lot less than when I bought it. I prefer it over the newer ones. Much more versatile. It is a windows program. I do editing for other people.

The only way to get rid of it, is ceasing all activity within your email and Y!A until it expires.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Only the YA team can DELETE your account. Closing your EMAIL ID deactivates the YA account, but you also lose everything attached to that email account. After 4 months, the YA profile WILL disappear. But ALL Q&A from that profile are still visible & searchable on site. IN VOTING or RESOLVED Q&A remain the property of Yahoo.    Blank out your avatar, nickname and 'About Me'.   Close links to 360, IM or email.   Delete open questions and answers.  Set Network and Q&A to private.   Then just leave.|`|AA10421992	Here is some info and the link you'll need if you still decide to delete your account after reading what Yahoo has to say  http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/acct/ho...
C6jFigESaa	Hi Forever and always     Before I answer your question, I hope you are seeking an answer and not seeking answers to validate your feelings.      I don't believe you have more enemies than I do.  I am one of the most recognizable, most hated, most envied, and most trolled members on Yahoo! Answers, and guess what?  My profile is open, not privatized, and no matter what a troll does he cannot harm me.    You probably wondering now how such a guy like me is so brave to keep his profile open to the public when he's such a target.    Here is how I defend myself from being targeted:    1. I studied the CG ( Community Guidelines) and TOS ( Terms of Service) so that my contents will be eligible for reinstatement if they get erroneously reported.  I do this to improve myself.    2. I obey the rules.  This is because I respect the site and to help avoid from being targeted.     3. I appeal.  When you appeal a content successfully, you will become harder to be reported. This is because you build your reputation when you win appeals.     So, instead I go about blaming trolls for my own mistakes, I accept them to improve my participation on Yahoo! Answers.     I mean, if I realized you are speeding, I will keep an eye on you and report you each time you violate road regulation.   The same applies here: if you keep on violating Answers code of conduct, members will keep on reporting you.     I am really sorry if this is not the answer you wanted. But this is the answer I have because people who complain about being trolled are people who often break the Guidelines.    UPDATE:    I also took a look through your questions and answers and found many violations in them.  See what I am saying?  You might need to read the Community Guidelines    I hope this helps.|`|V44ARW4maa	if you tick off a troll, they'll find you, but making your settings private will help deter them. And i've gotten dozens of violation notices and i'm still around. Just don't call names, swear--and ask reasonable questions, or give honest answers and it SHOULD cut down on your violations.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	I agree with good guy on this one.  Be constructive and have fun.  I put my Q&A private to avoid this behavior tht empowers the weak of mind and skill.  Appeal all violations and give a reasonable rationale for your answer.  If you feel you know the troll then include the name.  Block these people and continue to have a good time. This really makes them mad.  Move about to other categories as well. Many have great contribuotrs that are really caring and fun as well.

You can use your own Yahoo id to log in.    2) Then upload the picture from your computer to the site using Upload option. Right click on the picture and copy the URL link and paste it when you ask a question. If you want large size images then click 'All sizes' above the photo and paste the 'Grab the photo's URL'.    You could also use these websites: -  http://photobucket.com/  http://fotopic.net/  http://www.snapfish.com  http://www.tinypic.com    ?Photo bucket links may cause Error 999 when you try to upload a picture.

Make sure you have a blank space before and after the url, otherwise it won't be clickable!    If you want to link to a pic which you have saved on your computer, you must get a free account with Flickr for example (belongs to Yahoo), upload your pic and then proceed as described above.
niivsTVxaa	Top Contributor doesn't equal no life, it just means the user is knowledgeable in 1-3 categories, and has received a considerable amount of best answers in a short space of time.    I personally am a full time student, have a great social life, and will be starting a part time job next week, i use Yahoo! Answers on the average weekday from: 5:30AM-7:30Am & then 7:00Pm-10PM those hours do not interrupt with any aspect of my normal life.    I have sat on Yahoo! Answers all day before when i was ill, but as i said being a Top Contributor means you are giving good answers to questions where your answers are being chosen as best.    Who is to say that there isn't users who don't answer in many different varieties of categories, doesn't get many best answers, and doesn't have at least 10% best answer, this user could sit on Y!A all day everyday, and not gain a TC badge.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Actually, getting the TC badge is pretty easy. It takes only a few GOOD answers that get Best Answers to get one. I had one in one section that I got after 12 answers and 3 Best Answers. Even 'lazy folks' can answer that much!|`|WXExyAlWaa	lol. Actually I am genuinely living on a sickness benefit, so I do have a lot of spare time.    I was really shocked when I saw the top contributor page come up though! I didn't think I'd done anywhere near enough to earn one. Mostly I just pop over here when I'm bored and answer a few questions to amuse myself. I mean, I give proper answers, but sometimes there's just such hilarious questions that it's more interesting than watching whatever crap is on tv.|`|zLKsBm1Uaa	They are having fun. May be helping some one out or getting people to rate their answer/question.|`|G4vFjh0yaa	Good question and it made me laugh to read the responses as I am sure it will you.  The fact is it isnot rocket science to make yourself TC or BA there are system glitches that will do that.  Read all your answers from those with the badges.  The humble ones that are here to help or to contribute are not offended by your question.  Those are the real TC BA people. They take the spirit of YA which is to help and to enjoy the site without putting people down.  There are many reasons why people spend time here. Those reason are not to be judged. The last of which I would think is lazy.  Some may not be able to leave their homes.  Others may not be able to see family and friends as much as they would like.  But foremost is that they do and should not be assumed to be lazy.

They stopped supporting the service ages ago,  they SAY that the new profile system will be expanded to include blogging, but I've yet to see them keep a promise yet.|`|7u77AiBjaa	Yes, eventually.    Yahoo is migrating parts of 360 to a universal profile system (UPS). This transition was announced in October 2007 and the UPS actually started in a rudimentary beta form on October 16, 2008. The primary migration area is the Yahoo! Profile (http://profiles.yahoo.com ). The Y!360 part of the system hasn't been transferred over fully yet. Really, the only thing left to transfer is the blogging part of 360.  - See blogs at http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360 for more details. The 360 team blog is also accessible via the "Yahoo! 360 News" link in the upper right corner of your 360 space. You can post complaints on their blog, but don't expect a personal response.   - See the links in these blog entries for more details on Yahoo's overall direction ("Open Strategy") and UPS: http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... , http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... , and http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... .|`|B5kUQd3Gaa	Nope it's staying right here.

You use the emotes by either clicking on the emote button in an IM convo, or typing the characters for it. For example, :D becomes a toothy grin.      Google: Yahoo!

However---if you're talking about unwanted "Spam" mail---your best bet is to just click the "Spam tab" (or delete them) and let Yahoo deal with it.  Blocking Spam addresses isn't very effective at all, cause the spammers change their addresses (just a letter or so) with each mailing, and that helps them to slip past blocks.|`|e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	For New Mail  Go to options -> mail options -> spam -> type the unwanted email address under add a blocked address -> click add -> click "save changes".

The number in the middle is the median, in this case it came out to be 75. To get to the middle you can do one of two things. One thing you can do is count in from both ends of the set, the other is to use the formula ( [the number of data points] + 1)/2. For this set the formula would be (13 + 1) / 2. <br>  14 / 2 = 7, so you would count 7 spaces in.<br>  <br>  Mode: 70<br>  The mode is the number that appears the most in the set.

C6jFigESaa	It is my pleasure to respond. <br>  <br>  The only way a guy can know for "certain" if a girl isn't a virgin is if she tells him.  <br>  <br>  A lot of guys believe when a girl bleeds after having intercourse it indicates that the girl is a virgin because it proves that the hymen ( a slim, fleshy membrane that partially covers the vaginal opening) broke. However, this is not always the case. And not all women bleed after having intercourse for the first time. <br>  <br>  Yes, the hymen usually stretches during penetration, but it is also very common for the hymen to tear before a woman ever has sex.  Simply physical exercise, like riding a bicycle, can done this, and many more.  Because of Community Guidelines reasons, I cannot elaborate more on causes to hymen being ripped. <br>  <br>  Anyway, a man seriously cannot know for sure if a girl isn't a virgin if the girl doesn't tell him, especially if the girl hasn't had intercourse for a long time. <br>  <br>  Just a little advice for you:  Tell the truth from the beginning so you won't live in fear for the rest of your life ;-) <br>  <br>  Take care
