20090131202851AA6WDgN	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	What programming language is best when developing a shopping cart with Flash?	According to studies, is it ASP.net, C++, Java, Visual Basic, ColdFusion.  At this point I'm studying ASP.net, I don't want to spend a waste of time in this, if it's not going to give me the results I'm looking for.  I came across a section that said ColdFusion is primarily used by "some" developer because it's similar to ActionScript, but then it went on to say that ASP.net is also similar as well.        So for you guru's out there how can I integrate a well functional shopping Cart database that is server-side driven with my Flash User Interface?

I've been using Visual C++ for a few weeks now, and STILL haven't figured out how to get the compiler to work. I go to the Build tab, I click Compile, and... nothing happens. It says that the Build was successful, but I don't see the .exe file in any nearby folders, or in the 'Visual Studio 2008' folder. There IS an .exe file, but it must not be the correct one, since I get an error message saying nothing but '6', and then crashing.

20090226082702AApyR6Q	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Can I have 2 Wireless Routers in 1 House - More In Depth...?	So this is my situation. I have my xbox 360 upstairs, and my computer. Currently, the only way to get xbox live on that, is if I plug the ethernet wire from my 360, to my PC, then use my USB wireless thing on my PC, to pick up a signal from a wireless router downstairs, and then bridge the connection. Problem with this is, sometimes I have to change the UP NP setting every time (I just click apply every time and it works fine again).       My previous set up was that my xbox 360 was in the kitchen, and the router is in the living room, and we had a wire running through the wall from the kitchen to the living room and then my 360 was plugged into the wireless router.       Basically, what I want to do is, I have a 2nd wireless router, and I want to plug that one in my room, but in my room, we don't have another one of them phone things, so I'd only be able to plug it into the power. That's it. Then, if I can plug in my router, I want to plug my 360 into the new router, so I don't have to keep turning on my PC (which wastes electricity) and have to keep clicking apply every time.      So to sum it up. Here was my previous set up.      My Room with my Computer.      Xbox 360 in kitchen, wireless router in the living room, which of course is plugged into that phone thing on the wall. Then a cable connecting the 360 to the router.      This is what I want now.      My Room with Xbox 360 and my computer. Plug in the new wireless router, but remember it won't plug into the phone wall thing. Then plug 360 into new router.      Downstairs, old wireless router somehow sharing the network from downstairs into the new router.      I hope that explains everything correctly.       If you wish to talk to me in more detail, please tell me your msn, or add me, I believe my email is on my profile page.      Thanks in advance!

20090226083719AA5IyeL	Computers & Internet;Internet;Facebook	Facebook and other social networking sites becoming addicting and bad for vulnerable people?	Maybe I'm an Internet addict because I work in front of a computer for 8 hours everyday, but recently, I started to feel very depressed do to social networking sites (mainly Facebook). I'm a seasoned Myspace user (I've had my account for years and don't look at it much anymore), but Facebook became similar to a crack-addiction. It went from me logging on only once a day to several times a day, playing with the applications, writing more "notes", stalking people I liked, and feeling like my life was inadequate because everyone else seemed happier and more fulfilled. In the end, I just felt like it was a controlling my life and I making me depressed...since then, I deleted my Facebook account. But I guess what I'm saying is it worries me that millions of people are signing themselves onto social networking sites everyday. I'm sure this sounds stupid to the occasional user of Myspace or Facebook, but for people who lack control or have "nothing better to do"...social networking can become a real problem. Has Facebook or other social media site affected you in this way? Have you felt the need to delete your accounts? Lastly, do you think that in the near future, more and more people will come forward with social networking addiction problems? I'm in my mid-twenties and I find it sad that I could get addicted to something so meaningless.

20090226082410AAYljYJ	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	How to deal with large number of RSS subscriptions?	I'm using RSS feeds for a long time now, and my collection has grown so today I've hundreds of new item's per day. I can't read them all, of course, but I don't want to delete any of them, because every one of the RSS feeds can by interesting from time to time. So, is there any program/internet service which would assist me, and watch my habits (which items I'm reading and which I'm only marking as read) and, based on that and other factors, suggest me most interesting items to read?   I've heard of something like that few months ago, but I can't remember this program's name.      thanks!

20090226083529AAg5Uws	Computers & Internet;Security	What do you hate the most about emails that claim to be opportunities for you to collect a large sum of money?	So many emails come saying you have won a lottery or that a relative of yours has died and left you a large sum of money or some other reason why you are in line to receive a substantial amount of money.    - What are the effects on people as a whole? Good or Bad?    - Do these emails actually help people not be naive and to be realistic in the world we live in?    - Or are things like these part of the reason the world is this way?      The worst thing I see in this issue is that they are preying on people's optimism, in effect helping to rob the world of it when people lose it after being scammed enough times.

Hi everyone,      My self made computer has been working great for about five years. Over the past couple months, though, it has some problems booting up. Now, after I push the power button, the computer turns on and the fans start up, but the computer never "beeps" or boots up. It just sits there with all of its fans spinning. If I push the reset button while the computer is in this state, the computer beeps and starts up just fine. Does anyone have any idea about what is going on and what I can do before things get worse? Thanks so much!

20090131164030AA11ec2	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	I could use some help with my hard drive?	My computer guy re-formatted my hard drive into two "volumes"; C & D (new volume).   My operating system is on C, and the programs are on D.   The problem is that I am constantly being prompted to do a disk cleanup on C, due to low memory, mostly from temporary internet files that have accumulated.   Needless to say, this is aggravating.   Is it possible to easily re-allocate more disk space to volume C?   Or, could I somehow reset the machine to use drive D (where there's lots of space) for temporary memory?   Any other ideas, suggestions, or links would be appreciated.

Well, since I'm stuck with my Dell for at least the next 5 months until I get a Mac, what can I do with it?      I really like photography and making movies out of my pictures, but Windows Movie Maker just isn't doing it for me! Are there any programs that are free where I can actually edit out parts of my movies and add songs from my iTunes library to it?       Are there any cool features on Dell that are just random, fun, or interesting?      Where in Los Angeles or online can I get a whole new keyboard for my broken key because some stupid guy at the computer store says I have to replace the keyboard on my laptop because he can't fix it!      Any webcam suggestions? I have a Logitech Quickcam for desktops (even though I have a laptop) and I am very unsatisfied with it. It won't work with Skype, AIM, or Yahoo! Messenger. :-(         Any quick and free ways to make it work faster or are there any fun hacks?      My computer DOES NOT hold a charge. I was on Facebook in my room for about 15 minutes and it wasn't plugged in, and it shut down on me! Is it time for a new battery?      Please, anything you know of that will help with any of these things, please do!      Thanks!!!!      ~Joe

If there aren't different kinds of routers, how do I get internet from my router wirelessly, without hooking it up?

I didn't get one because 1. didn't bother to make the time to, 2. i've seen what it does to people, how it becomes some fake popularity contest and who can post the most pictures of themselves, etc.      Not saying I hate it or hate people that have facebooks, I just choose not to have one. The privacy thing isn't an issue at all - I don't care if random people can see my name and picture. I just don't really care for this, so I choose not to have one.      Everyone thinks that's weird, because everyone has one. Is this weird?

My laptop supports memory speeds up to DDR2 667 (PC2 5300) but I found a great deal on DDR2 800 (PC 6400). I'm wondering if it will accept the higher speed memory.

Every few minuets it freezes for around 20-30 seconds, then starts up again.  There seems to be no trigger for this, the browser will simply begin to freeze after half an hour of running fine.  The computer doesn't seems to be processing any information when this happens as the hard drive is quiet.  Any activity attempted when the browser is frozen won't work (eg. typing, scrolling, minimising the window, backing up) but once it resumes it will catch up resulting with any previous input and a moment of chaos will happen where everything tries to happen at once.    As I've been typing this question the browser has frozen three time already...  grrrr    Im using Vista and Internet Explorer (not sure of the number).  I have a broadband connection of 8MB and I'm using a router.    Can someone suggest a solution - it's really annoying me.

20090131182428AAZiT6m	Computers & Internet;Internet;YouTube	What are some good alternatives to Youtube?	I've posted a video on Youtube twice. The first time it was removed completely, the second it had its audio removed, both times I think because of a song I used in it. Now I wouldn't be so annoyed about this except I didn't put the name of the song or the band anywhere in the title or description. The only way that Youtube managed to find it was using audio fingerprinting, which always seems like an odd method to me since I can find many more illegally uploaded copies of the same song just by typing it into the search box. Whereas my vid wouldn't show up in a search by anyone just looking to listen to the music for free.      Anyway, the point is that I've been growing more and more tired of Youtube ever since they sold out like the backstreet crack whores that they are to Google. So what are some good alternative video hosting sites that are like Youtube but are lighter on the Copyright-Nazi front?

20090131165212AAZFf7o	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Help me uninstall internet explorer 8.  I can't do it.?	Hi.  I have internet explorer 8, and after I downloaded some microsoft "security updates" this morning.  IE8 stopped working.  Every time I click on it, it freezes up immediately.  No problem: I just use firefox and  just downloaded Chrome and Opera.     I'm trying to now uninstall IE8, but every time I try I get this error message during the part where the little window is copying files.    "Setup cannot copy the file hmmapi.dll.mui.  Ensure that the location specified below is correct, or change it and insert "Windows NT service pack Uninstall directory" in the drive you specify."    Now, I've tried typing in "Windows NT service pack Uninstall directory" in the "copy files from" box that currently has C:\Windows\ie8 in it, but that doesn't work.    I've tried uninstalling ie from my controll panel and also from my CC cleaner program and both don't work.    I've also tried doing a system restore, but that didn't work either.    I've tried installing a new version of ie out of my firefox window, and that doesn't work.  It won't install correctly.  It brings up a ie install help window that immediately freezes.    I just want internet explorer off my computer!    Does anyone have any suggestions?  And thanks in advance.

Our main modem is on the opposite side of the house on the opposite floor from our xbox 360.  We do have wireless but I do not want to run the 360 off of our wireless because the hardwire has twice the speed-100 mbps (we have the fastest AT&T has to offer with the fiber-optic lines) vs. the 54 mbps with the wireless.  I realize that we can have both modems, but that they cannot be running at the same time.  Does anyone know if AT&T will allow one extra modem free of charge to run just for the xbox 360.  We really cant change where the 360 and the main modem are, and running an ethernet cord just isn't an option for us.  Any suggestions?      Thanks.

20090131172310AAsnYBf	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Difference between structure and union?	I was trying to find the points of distinction between structure and union. Here's what i found:   1. Multiple variables of a single structure can can be created.       Only one object of a given union can be created at a time.   2. Keyword strict is used to define a structure.       Keyword union is used to define a union.   3. Only a single block of memory is reserved for a union.       The amount of memory reserved for a structure is equal         to the no. of different variables define in the structure definition.   4. The size of the structure is equal to the sum of all the variables of different data types defined in it.       The size of a union is equal to the size of the largest element.   5. Structure pointers can be created.       Union pointers cannot be created.   6. A structure can be passed as an argument to a function.       A union cannot be passed as an arg. to a function.      I'm not sure about the last two points whether they are valid or not. Please correct me if i'm wrong.

"I'm not sure if you know your pictures are on the dotcom site named blendclash"       I got the above comment on my Facebook wall from an acquaintance on Facebook, and it totally caught me off guard. I've never heard of this blendclash site and, even after searching multiple times for it, I can't find it. I know the only place I've posted mulitple photos of myself are MySpace and Facebook, but Facebook is set to friends only for the photo viewing. I just looked and found out that my MySpace photo albums weren't set to Friends Only (I thought they were ... I just changed that.) and I know that my profile isn't set to privet so I know anyone can see it (I don't have anything privet on there so it didn't seem that big a deal). But, still, I can't find the site       If any of you know of this site could you please tell me what it is and give me a link?      I'm seriously hoping that this person is just lying, because I don't want my photos anywhere that I didn't personally put them.      I thank all of you who take the time to answer and try to help me out.

20090131184437AAO12iu	Computers & Internet;Internet;YouTube	Music video copyright issues on youtube?	I'm in 8th grade and for our media class we have to do an independent media project, which can be any genre of media, like a movie, CD, music video, painting, etc. My best friend and I wanted to make a music video of a song that already exists, Love Show by Sonohra. We want to post it on youtube, too. The only thing of theirs that we will use in the music video is the song, and maybe some clips of them singing from their other music vids. If I post on the side that the song is theirs and not owned by us, and their clips are theirs, will I have copyright issues? Or do I need to ask the music group for permission first? How do I not get into copyright problems?

I have Maxed out my ram [which is only 2 gigs ....i have a rather old XP]      And, I really don't have a lot of big stuff on my computer, just a lot of lil crap that gets installed here or there, and some stuff thats uninstallable.

(I need all the fast I can get, as, I have The Sims 2 w/ 6 expansions and 2 stuff packs installed)      Thanks... oh, and not to forget the avast security [free] ...though, i must say that i don't scan often, but, i do use windows defender every 10 days, when it tells me it needs scanning.

20090226090544AAYCsYy	Computers & Internet;Internet;YouTube	Help with youtube copyrighted song?	After about 3 tedious weeks of making my first video on Windows Movie Maker, I gleefully uploaded it onto youtube.      But then down went my hopes to the bottom of the sea when I saw that they had muted it.  I had purposely matched the clips to the music!  It says the audio track to the video has not been authorized by WMG. I've tried to audio-swap it, but the song I want ("Remember the Name" by Fort Minor) isn't there.        What can I do?  How can I get the song's copyright permission? Is there any I can use the song?      This is the video I am dying to complete and share.  It just doesn't have the music to it!    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7kgwVi73...

My old one was a wireless G router, which I thought was a LOT slower then N, but I really can't see a huge difference. I download at roughly 330 kbps on both of the connections, and the only difference is that the wireless broadcast went up a little. Is it maybe my service provider, or whats happening? Wired my G was at 100 mbps and it still is 100 mbps even with N. Any suggestions? It may be my ISP, as I didn't upgrade it with my computer, but if there are any other possibilities it would be helpful to hear them.

20090131195542AAIfbok	Computers & Internet;Software	ITunes and Safari put together?	OK so i was listening to my itunes music and surfing the web at the same time then it hit me. "what if iTunes and Safari could both be in 1 browser?"    I mean that itunes has a great way to browse and play ur music with list, coverflow and grid view. but what im trying to say is that if its capable of doing all that browsing and organizing then y not also make it an internet browser.    heres some ideas to expand browsing with itunes:    list view- this can give details about browsing history like how many times been to this website and when. this can be disabled so it does not keep records    grid view- this would be useful for bookmarks, favorites, history and even make plugins for websites (facebook, twitter, youtube, etc.) these can also be disabled     coverflow- like file browsing in finder wouldnt it be a great if with this u can browse websites? like when ur on a website and theres a link but dont want to click it and stay on the same page, then u get a chance to highlight the link and on top of the browser there would be a quicklook button to see a preview of the link.    itunes sidebar (where library, store, playlists and devices appear)- this sidebar can be hidden and recovered with a single click of an arrowthat appears on the top left under the play/pause/next buttons. this bar would be able to hold tabs (up to 50 that can be browsed with grid view/coverflow and list).    the application should still be called itunes but there should be a headline named internet and under internet should be itunes store and safari (this is in the sidebar)     and of course itunes still has all its feature (syncing, playing files, etc) and can play music simotaneously.     please leave comments and feedback. this is not a real application just my thoughts and it would be compatible with macs, pcs and maybe ubuntus.

Specifically, I'm looking for a feature where someone can post a note (or something like it) that can be edited and added on to by friends of the person who posted it.  My friend recently posted a note that includes all the random/funny sayings that have been said in our class, and it would be great if not only he, but any of the 265 people in our class could add on to, as there are no doubt tons of funny stuff said every day that never makes it to the list.  Thanks!

20090226085405AAuv3oi	Computers & Internet;Security	Please help!!! Antivirus 360 is eating into my computer!!?	I don't know how this horrible Antivirus 360 has entered my comp, but i can't find any way to delete it at all! I did some research on it, and found out that this is itself a virus.      Several websites gave me names of some softwares which cud remove them (I tried 'Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware', and all other techniques stated on any page on the web), but as soon as the softwares launch, they either keep shutting down mysteriously on their own, or keeps rebooting the system all by itself non-stop. The Antivirus 360 cannot be removed my me by any possible method. It has slowed down my comp and the internet speed by half, and the infinite number of pop-ups prevent me from playing any games or type anything too. Please do help me with this.   What do I do?   Please give me some simple but detailed information on this?   Will formatting my hard disk help??

20090226090023AACCpbE	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How easy is it to take over an existing website from a previous administrator?	I belong to a group who have their own website, and for the last few years, our secretary has maintained the site, but over recent months he's been doing it less and less. I've been asked to take over as I have lots of experience of in-house CMS production systems, but I have never created a site from scratch. We want to keep the domain name and url, so how do I go about changing the administrator? Do I need to get the server details and so on from him?    Also, would I need to create the new site in the same software as he used originally or can I use the same URL but start from scratch on all other aspects?      Thanks

He is running the XP with the latest updates and as well as up-to-date antivirus and antispyware. The OnScreen Keyboard works ok. Also (maybe unrelated), he just started getting this diagnostic: `Microsoft Office Outlook - Error in registry for extension "exchange extensions?"
