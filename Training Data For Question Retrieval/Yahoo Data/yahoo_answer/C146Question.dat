20090220170627AA3FuqZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Is it so terribly wrong?	Is it wrong to have a baby so that I can be with the father? Not vindictively. I wouldn't make it an "accident" or lie to him about it being an accident. I don't want a meal ticket. but is it wrong for the deciding factor to have a baby to be that you want to be together?      If I did get pregnant, we could get married, move in together and just be together with a family with out needing parental permission (we're both still minors and he lives in another state)   We both really want children and if it did happen by accident we would both be very happy.   I want a baby so terribly bad for so many reasons, but it seems like that may be my biggest explainable reasons. Is that wrong?            I don't want to hear "you're too young, too immature, don't know what you're getting yourself into, don't throw away your life and dreams"   This is a decision, so I obviously want it. It's just like any other dream that I would pursue with just as much doggedness and passion and I wouldn't be throwing anything away.
20090220170924AAnID7o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Am I being selfish or is this not fair?	I'm going to post this here because I like this section...      A little back ground on the situation... MY In-Laws live 45 minutes from us. My SIL's live with in 10 minutes of them. My one SIL has 2 children age 5 and 16 months. My MIL ALWAYS has them. All the time.       So now that you have the history whenever my in-laws come to visit us they bring my SIL's kids with them.  My oldest had a school music show a couple weeks ago and my MIL brought my SIL's kids with her. Instead of watching MY son she spent the entire time fussing over the 16 month old. When the 16 month old is around he is so possessive of my MIL she can't hold my 9 month old. They say it so they bring them along so they can have "company" on the trip to our house. It hurts my feelings because I feel like they never give MY kids their undivided attention.        Don't get me wrong. I love them so much. They are great people...      Am I being selfish or is it not fair? I'm having a hard time seeing it clearly.

20090220170712AAHid7k	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Has anyone else went through this?	I have 3 girls. 2 of them are very close in age. They share a room together.   The 3 year old has, twice now, gotten into the crib with her sister and took off her diaper when it was poopy...then she took the poop and smeared it all over her doll house... The 17 month old has taken some of the same said crap...and smeared it all over her crib.   I have told the 3 year old not to touch her sister's diapers anymore. To tell mommy if Ruth is "icky" so that I can change her (thinking that maybe she was initially trying to just change her sister for what ever reason) I've also told her that it's gross, and to stay out of her sister's crib from now on, unless she asks mommy first!    Ohhh the things that young ones do when you think they are sound asleep! LOL   Has anyone else went through any kind of experience with anything like this before??? Please tell me i'm not the only one!
20090220171253AANrmhS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I am really freaked out, advice?	My fiance and I have been talking a lot about having children after we are married. Right now I keep my niece 5 days a week from 7am-5:30pm so I have been able to see how hard it is being a mom. It is so exhausting, she is 3 and so busy. I feel like I am already burnt out, I have been keeping her since she was 2. Not to mention I am really scared of how bad it is going to hurt. My sister told me it is not as bad if you get the epidural and all but I am still really scared, I don't do well with pain. I love my fiance so much and I would love to have a child with him but I just feel like it is going to be really tiring and change our relationship. He wants to have a baby like 1-2 years after we get married and I am thinking more along the lines of 3-4 years. Did any of you ever feel like this?? Did things turn out better than you expected?? How bad was the pain, I feel like no one is being honest with me about the pain factor?

20090220171315AAwNYyB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Dizziness and cramping at 6 1/2 weeks pregnant?	I am 6 weeks & 4 days pregnant.   Last night I was trying to make some dinner, and I started sweating and got really light-headed and dizzy. I had to go sit down or I was going to pass out. I've also felt light-headed to day too. Each time I have to go sit down.      And I've also been cramping.   The cramping kinda feels like period cramps. But there's no bleeding (obviously), and they don't last as long is duration. They just come and go when they please.   But I've noticed more in the past week or so, that they still come and go, but there's more of them. Ya know what I mean?      I know severe cramping and bleeding may mean a miscarriage. But they aren't too bad. And I've had no bleeding. So I'm not worried about that.      Is that this just my pregnancy progressing? And is this normal for 6-7 weeks?   Thanks!

I know this is going to sound silly because i already have one child.  but for him i was induced at 37 weeks.   being induced and having a natural labour should feel the same right?  I'm wondering cause i don't know if i got the epidural for the wrong reasons.        the nurse was asking if i was having contractions yet and said no.  when in fact i was having them every 3 min.  anyway the only thing really that was uncomfortable was the pushing sensation.  this is why i got the epidural.        what i'm asking is -- are the pushing sensations contractions or was i just really lucky with him and not feeling any labour pains.  because if the pushing sensations are always going to be felt then i don't want to get another epidural.

Just some insite to the situation; their dad pretty much abandoned us and shows up when he feels like it.  I think that may be a big part of it but still they have to mind.

I put my baby down for bed (he is 11 weeks) after our normal bedtime routine. I know he is tired, cause he is showing all signs. So anyways, I lay him down, drowsy but awake. Sometimes he will just lay in there for an hour, not crying, just looking around. He will close his eyes on and off, but it takes him forever to fall asleep. I am tempted to go in there and rock him a little to make him more drowsy but I don't want him to get into the habit of needing it to fall asleep. Is this ok that he lays there for so long awake? He doesn't cry while awake..

20090203083501AAkVyCq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How much time do you give your 2 yr old to calm down?	*repost - few answers in the previous question *      My 2 yr old son does what most toddlers do when they can’t say the word, he whines. And it drives me freaking NUTS! Because it’s this high pitched whine/scream.       Last night he wanted something in the kitchen and he whined his whole way through. Our biggest challenge right now is getting our son to actually SAY what he wants. He’s perfectly capable but it’s obviously easier for him to whine and usually Daddy gives him what he wants, so he knows whining works well. I, on the other hand, don’t typically give in and I will wait until our son calms down, quiets down, or tries to say the word. But sometimes he’ll get very loud, very whiny, and he’ll scream and cry because he’s not getting what he wants instantly. (Yes, I know, normal toddler)      I’m well aware that my husband and I need to be on the same page but actually making that happen, I feel like I’m walking to wall. My husband always thinks that he knows what our son needs so he just does. Now another thing that worries me is that my stepdaughter has speaking issues because her mother and father ignored a lot of the signs. I do defend my husband that he has tried, he’s made phone calls, he’s paid for therapy, but her mother dropped the ball and has other priorities. And now my 5 yr old stepdaughter struggles big time. She gets made fun of at daycare, she struggles with speaking so her confidence is low, and she’s having a hard time adapting to daycare with the big kids. She’s not my child so I can only say my piece but in the end, she’s not my child and I can do nothing to help her. But our son, he IS my child and I will not repeat that same mistake nor will I allow it to happen. So I DO feel it’s important.       Now how long do you let your 2 yr old freak out and throw their little fit before you can speak to them? Do you just let them be and throw their tantrum regardless of how long it’s been? Every time I try and wait for our son to be calm, when I go to speak to him about what it is he wants, or what behavior he did was wrong, whatever the case is, he starts back up with whining when I start speaking. I know consistency is key here, so do I just keep on? Continue to put him in timeout to calm himself? (He can’t go in his room because he has toys all over and that’s not exactly MY idea of time out even though I’m sure for him it’s great)      I guess I’m just wondering how many times is too many? I know with a 2 yr old, their attention span is a short one anyways. So at what point do I give up or try another way? I just feel like it’s useless sometimes….
20090203083715AATSMok	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Mini Mean Girls? Mother's advice?	My daughter is 4...she's been at pre-school for a year now and now is at "real school" Now I am not saying she is an angel...what child is? But she never had any maliciousness in her before she went to school...she hasn't turned into a monster but she has picked up certain things from other girls at school...things like saying "Oh you cannot come to my party if you aren't nice to me" (I said if I'm not there then there won;t BE a party!}) And simil;ar things like "Oh Anna cannot come to tea at Maisie's because Anna is mean"...and once she told me how someone Else's Mother was fat...I haven't even USED the word fat around her! I have NEVER said things like this...so she has to get them from the other girls..my question is ...Where do THEY get it from? Their Mothers? Surely no Mother would teach their child to say things like this? I worry that she will fall prey to peer pressure as she grows and I want her to think as an individual...and not to fear the idle threats that some girls come out with...I am sure that if one day "Anna" is being left out then one day it will be my daughter.....why cannot they all be nice? WHO teaches them to say these things? Will any Mother here admit to it? WHat do you think?

For some reason, the past couple of days I have had a really painful back/shoulder, its been getting worse to the point today I can barely hold my son, lean into his cot feed in many positions, turn my head fully etc.    Well since I am breastfeeding, I am pretty limited to what I can take, I am waiting to speak to my GP (runs an on-call phone service from 5.15pm) as often there are things you can have for a short period.    Has anybody been prescribed anything for pain relief/ anti-inflammatory drugs while breastfeeding,    Any idea what they could do?    Luckily his Dad has been off work because of the snow but I don't know what I'll do when he goes back because its so painful to lift my son.

He wasn't chubby at all which suprised me he was so big. He's very solid and strong and at his 2 month appointment yesterday (hes 9 weeks old) he weighed at 14.15 and 25 inches long. The doctor couldn't believe how big and healthy he is. he's at 96% with his weight and length. He said he's going to be very tall when he's an adult. His dad is tall and both of dads and grandpas were tall. Runs both of our families. He has to wear 3-6 month clothes because he's so long and the clothes are so baggy around his tummy. I'm still amazed how big he is, any of you moms have a big baby too? He also will pick himself up when you grab his hands and holds his up very good when on his tummy.

20090203083356AAMjugc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Implantation or period?	Ok, I must admit this 2 WW has been awful! LOL I have another question. (imagine that)! So I had my lh surge on the 28-29,I was spotting with egg white cm on the 28th. I BD the 27 and 28th and said a little prayer! I had been reading how many women notice a lotiony or creamy cm after but I didn't. I had one day of heavy creamy cm (tmi, sorry) and then I seemed to dry up. My luteal phase is rather short and only between 10-12 days, I was going with 11 this month meaning that I am about 6-7 dpo BUT my period is due in about 5-6 days. Yesterday, I felt very ill and what might be slight tenderness in my breast with quite a bit of cramping in my lower abdomen (uterus area) most of the day. Today I went to the bathroom and there is an increase of cm that is somewhat thick, not stretchy. No more pain, maybe a bit of tenderness in my breasts and not feeling as bad as I did yesterday. I never really paid much attention to cm the week before my period so I am wondering if this is normal or could it have been implantation? I know that I only have a 20% chance to conceive so I am not getting my hopes up, especially since I have a short luteal phase, decreasing my chances = ( Just wondered if anyone could shed some light, amuse me as I wait for the 2WW to end. Anyone had similar things going on? Thank you so much for all your help and lots of baby dust to all of you in my same boat! Also what is the earliest some of you have got BFP on HPT?

20090203084012AA3zsaE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Help with diaper rash?	I went to the doctors 2 weeks ago and the pediatrician gave her some cream for her diaper rash. He said it could be a type of yeast infection. We used almost the entire bottle of cream and now her diaper rash looks like the sores are starting to bleed a little bit. Is this a new type of rash or is this from the wipes. I noticed the blood blisters after I wiped her a lot from a dirty diaper. I am giving her time to roll around without a diaper, hoping it will help. Could this be from teething? She is 9 months old with no teeth yet.

20090203082604AABDabU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Can someone share with me how middle school differs from gradeschool?	My 10 dd will start middle school next year and will be going to a different middle school than the town she is in now.  I know that they go from class room to class room and have a home room but other than that I'm clue less.  We only have one child so we have never gone through this before.  I've heard that there is so... much cliquishness esp. with girls and bullying.  I'm kinda worried, esp since it's a new school anyway and she won't know anyone or few.  We are having her in this school because it's 4 miles away instead of the 14 miles that she travels now and she wants to be in sports.

20090203082520AAJnTsY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Can someone put this into layman's terms for me?	My husband and I have an appointment with the reproductive endocrinologist next week.  I submitted an inquiry to the insurance company to find out what exactly the cover and here was my response:      Per your benefits booklet on page 25:    Infertility Services   As a HealthSelect participant you may be eligible for infertility services which may include, diagnostic laboratory and x-ray procedures, therapeutic injections and surgical treatment necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of involuntary infertility. Covered services do not include sterilization reversal, transsexual surgery, gender reassignment, artificial insemination and related services, intrafallopian transfer, or in vitro fertilization. Also excluded from coverage are any services or supplies used in any procedures performed in preparation for or immediately after any of the above-referenced   excluded procedures.      Of course, the patient must be covered on the date of service to be eligible for benefits. This is not a guarantee of coverage or payment and all claims are subject to medical necessity and contract limitations      So, what does that include? Am I in good shape?  Where would IUI be included? Sorry so many questions, this will be our first appt with the RE. I'm sure they will go over this with us but I was just wanting a head's up. Thanks guys!

I realize that a babies genetic information is developed from a mix of the DNA contained in the sperm and the egg. But if a baby is essentially 'incubated' inside a surrogate mother for nine months, where they share food, blood, etc, would that relationship determine any traits (mannerisms, features, appearances) in the baby?

He never even makes love to me.  On some days he tells me he wants to try to make a baby, and then two days later or more he takes it back and says he doesn't want to try.  He's breaking my heart.  I want to have a baby with all of heart.  Everywhere I go anymore I see women who are pregnant or have babies and I start feeling so sad and hopeless. Why does he have to hurt me like this?  Eventually it will end our marriage.  I really don't want that to happen but I want to be with someone who will give me children.
