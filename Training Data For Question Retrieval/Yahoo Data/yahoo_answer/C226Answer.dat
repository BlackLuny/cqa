re0ntarsaa	i told u be4 that its a boy.  n i think that u don need any help 4 choosin the name.  i think the name is not the most important thing in this world.  (Luka)|`|gWCj87Y4aa	well my names tiffany and my brothers timothy so yer stick with timothy|`|JRCAa5Goaa	Here's a good site for you...    http://babynamesworld.parentsconnect.com...    ?|`|JukMqqm3aa	CHUCK! JAKE ASH CHARLIE JACK all names that are used in england!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4747P6edaa	I absolutely love the name Luka. It's great, and it represents both of you!|`|R85n51j5aa	I like Luka! It represents both of you and it is gorgeous! Not weird at all! =)|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I love Luka and Timothy. Both are nice. So glad you ditched Damian yuck..|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	timothy|`|tDGH4EC4aa	Lucas, Luke.     Haha get him a unique name like Lucrael haha i dont know!.|`|4DNDAGbXaa	I like Luka    (hugs!)    i'll think some more tho...|`|xLmtXZJ0aa	If it is a boy:    Luka or Luca- I really like that name because it takes the name Luke(i bit boring) and adds some pazazz!    Noah-  I like the name because it is traditional    Ian-  I like the name Ian because it is unique.    Daniel-  It is a little french and 100% cute!      If it's a girl:    Annabelle- Could be considered French and is very pretty    Georgia-  It is your history and is very traditional, yet uncommun.
NzSA6dmyaa	most of these sound like either a really bad cold or a weak flu virus maybe some other kind of virus or infection. I dont think these would have anything to do with u possibly being pregnant it might be worth seeing a doctor though as you sound pretty ill|`|1Amb5PHpaa	Either it's a horrible first trimester of pregnancy, or it's some sort of sickness, if any family members or anything like that have been sick, you might have caught it, like a flu or something...Or you're just pregnant..You might want to ask your doctor if you want.|`|tDw5Uesqaa	fever with chills and muscle and joint aches,loss of appetite and loss of weight are not diagnostic of pregnancy.but there is always a chance that it may be coincedental.if u doubt u r pregnant and want to keep it u must immediately go to doc because illnesses in early pregnancy may harm the baby.so dont postpone and do it as soon as possible|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Have you missed a period?  That actually sounds more like the flu than pregnancy, unless you have a good reason to believe that you might be pregnant.|`|h4Sc2JDwaa	just go now..it sounds like your pregnant or awfull ill..more than likely pregnant (and this will the be worst 1st trimester ever if you're already feeling that way!)
ApyKiltXaa	Stop listening to the metal.....    Your fiance sounds selfish too.  The two of you were irresponsible enough to get pregnant, and now she places the baby's life in jeopardy.  Sounds like you both need a big dose of maturity.    "Smoking marijuana during pregnancy may affect your baby's growth and the development of his nervous system. Studies have shown that children who were exposed to marijuana during pregnancy sometimes have problems focusing their attention and solving problems.    Children of heavy pot users may also have problems with short-term memory, concentration, and judgment. (There's no evidence so far, however, that marijuana use during pregnancy causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).    One study even found that young children whose mothers smoked marijuana during pregnancy had a higher risk of leukemia than those whose mothers did not.    What's more, there's no way to know if the pot you're smoking has been laced with other drugs (such as PCP) or contaminated with pesticides, which would put your baby at even higher risk. And using marijuana increases the chance that your baby will have birth defects if you're also drinking alcohol or smoking tobacco."|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Yes, it's bad. So what if you know one person whose baby was fine? If I run across the road with my eyes shut and don't get hit by a car, does that make it safe?    Limit herself? You should bin every drug she has and tell her to stop being so selfish. She's a mum now. Baby comes first.|`|Zgs4RncIaa	No you shouldn't stop worrying about your girlfriend using while she is pregnant! And if anyone gives you other advice such as "no don't worry baby will be fine" they are I D I O T S!!!!  The baby is totally defenseless and you have a right at this time to force your beliefs on her.  Tell her to suck it up and deal with the morning sickness! Lets see suggest I don't know Crackers and Sprite!   Go to the site listed and see the effects of drugs on your baby.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Tell her to stop being selfish. Its your child too.|`|aTk0A9SHaa	This is not good for the baby there's so much here that is just so wrong  firstly smoking  alone is bad for the baby but smoking weed is wrong on all levels its very much proven that weed affects the mind and long term users end up with mental health issues. As for it helping her with anxiety i think you'll find that its the drug that causes her to have the anxiety  Don't ask her to cut down tell her to STOP at the end of the day whats more important her needs to smoke or the health of this unborn baby|`|wBpennsMaa	Babies whose mothers smoke are at a greater risk for being born prematurely. Being born prematurely can lead to health problems the rest of the babies life.|`|8hwGmfs8aa	depends....most likey your baby will b fine......same as smoking really....my friend smoked weed wen she was preg nd de baby is fine|`|8gI2WPpbaa	It is absolutely bad. It might result in a deficiency of the growth of your child. You have to visit a doctor to tell he the rescues himself. You have to remember it is your son as well, and if anything bad happens to him, you will never forgive yourself!|`|b2a5a3043bdf63534f0643e795165672aa	Well I wouldnt imagine it would do baby any good but there are worse things to take in pregnancy, her telling you she takes it for morning sickness and anxiety is an excuse not to give up because she has an addiction. I know of a mother who smoked heavily pot whilst pregnant and her baby was born with one arm and not even a stump for the other, wether it was related to the marujanna i dont know but its something I would deffinately not try in pregnancy.  If she wont stop how about she cut right back to the minimum for now with the goal of quitting before baby is born, surely she isnt planning on smoking it around baby so giving up is a must!  Her midwife should be able to help her with giving up, if you ask for help wether its alcohol drugs or whatever they will help you and not frown down upon her, its those that dont ask that are looked as scum,   get her to get help for babies sake!|`|VGoCh2C9aa	no-one actually knows but ask her, is it really worth the risk?|`|DIZKlxNraa	Of course it is bad!! It can cause serious problems in baby's health.|`|UBK8U8hgaa	Its absolutely bad smoking anything while pregnant. Smoking pot can be bad for the baby and can cause still borns, miscarriages, low birth weight, and many more complications. Your wife is being stubborn and selfish. She needs to realise its your baby too and she is causing harm. All women go through morning sickness but you dont see us smoking pot. She can see a doctor to help with anxiety. Please try persuade her to stop|`|WvWFmwQoaa	well me personally i am dead against pot smokers and i don't think that in any way shape of form should someone smoke pot but then again that is just my belief i know allot of people who smoked pot while they were pregnant and there baby's have turned out fine and healthy however when i say that iam not saying that your fiance's baby will turn out with no problems so i don't really know but i wouldn't advise her to smoke it while being pregnant because i don't think it is wise or healthy because we all know what it does to adults brains and lungs so imagine what its doing to a little baby's who isn't even formed yet. so if you could i would try and at least get her to cut down the less the better :).. good luck and congratulations on the baby :)|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Some people will tell you that they smoked pot all through their pregnancy and their baby is "top of the class" and "has never been affected by it".  Those people were LUCKY. She's playing russian roulette with your child's life and their ability to develop. I don't see how this is even a question personally. I'd be telling her that she might not care about the baby but that you do and that she can only do it harm because smoking weed sure as hell won't do it any good!  (Sorry to get fired up but this one's close to my heart).|`|wNK5Bzv1aa	very bad.  Everything you smoke goes to you and your baby through your blood.  The baby will be born with addiction to Pot and also may have brain damage.  Even smoking regular cigarettes, alcohol or asprin are also bad.  Check with your doctor.|`|egAIuHQxaa	Is she crazy. Why would you want to risk you child's life to get high. Yeah maybe her friend may be the biggest pot head in the world. But she just might be one of those percents of people who's child might be hurt by it.|`|9ChgI0Hqaa	your friend might have smoked it....but i guess she was very lucky to have a healthly baby but then again, when there older- he will have many problems!    tell you're gf to stop! its disgusting and she might be one of the unlucky ones..|`|xwMWfuBTaa	YES it is harmful, any smoking is harmful.  it can learn to premature birth, low birth weight and circulation problems.    The child may APPEAR fine and healthy, but pot affects psychological development, you will never know the true potential that your child could've had, had the mother quit being SO SELFISH and thought of her babys needs over her own.|`|3BwPtNi2aa	You are right in being concerned. Yes, smoking marijuana is bad when you are pregnant. If she is feeling that sick she should be talking to her Doctor about it. It is precious cargo she is carrying. Why jeopardize the life and health of your unborn child?|`|tTbDaqlJaa	The baby might well be born without any problems if she continues, but why take the risk?  Apart from the increased risk of deformities, there are all sorts of other health complications that can arise, some of them aren't apparent until later in life.    If she were my girlfriend, I wouldn't be happy about it and would ask her to stop immediately.|`|NWVosihkaa	This is your baby too so you have a say. Smoking marijuana while pregnant can have very serious consequences. You should both look it up on the internet to find out the harm it can do. I had really bad morning sickness n did not feel the need to do anything like that, even if I have in the past (when I wasn't pregnant!)|`|dxlNwGuWaa	She needs to stop smoking weed full stop.  She is carrying a child.  She may very well have a healthy baby, but there is every chance she may not.  Everything she puts into her body goes to the baby.  Tell her to stop being selfish.  I mean, its your child too,  When its born is she going to be wrecked off her face all the time?  Fine mother she is going to be.|`|Qhiu3cYGaa	Hi there,  Your worry and concern is valid but i'm wondering if you did some research beforehand on the internet about it before asking emotional people who simply term it as bad without citing any proper research. And by research i mean proper objective research.  People saying good or bad go by hearsay.  Google Melanie Dreher who has done heaps of research on this topic and the verdict is- it is safe.  Unless smoking marijuana is combined with alchohol and tobacco.  Also check medical cannabis website.  Good luck and congrats on the pregnancy|`|Edkn6o5Vaa	yes thats bad..better stop soon!
cj7CYD9haa	Simple just say:    mumma, pappa im a whore.    there done.|`|TPnDIaQEaa	First off, why are you trying so hard to get pregnant at 17?    You do know that you can get fertility tests for both you and him at a local clinic instead of sleeping around right?     I don't know what to say. I am shocked and honestly, pretty disgusted.|`|VClxXNs3aa	on the maury show.... grossssssssss|`|vGxipYJnaa	There are other ways to test your fertility than just experimenting by having sex with men.    Anyway, you should probably just tell them if you plan on keeping the child. If not, there's no real reason to unless you'd like their support.    elaeblue: it depends where she lives! if she's in the UK she doesn't need consent, and many US states don't require it either.|`|TM3pNz6kaa	Sounds like an episode from Maury Povich....  Tell them straight, i think if your honest and upfront they appreciate it more than not telling them until its to late, you may be surprised at the support that they may have for you, you can always get a DNA test done to the men whom you think is the father after the baby is born. Congratulations and good luck....|`|fusIwst4aa	Just tell her the truth, that's the best way to deal with anything,and besides, if you don't tell her , she is gonna find out anyway,|`|6gthdHpnaa	Just tell them the truth, what you did was disgusting and there's really no way to sugarcoat it. You should have talked to the doctor about your inability to get pregnant instead of having sex with people you didn't know. They can use DNA testing to figure out who the father is, but your parents will probably still be upset.|`|8gI2WPpbaa	Oh my god! Better to tell them the truth|`|AA10529334	Just tell them like you  told us. Thats all you can do, there is really no other choice.      Olivia: shes 17 = still needs parental consent for abortion.|`|zrUbBiFdaa	just come out and tell them. and why the heck would you want to get pregnant at 17!?|`|HpWCjBv6aa	"Hi mom! You're probably going to be pissed off at me, and maybe even disown me, but I was ttc for over a year, and guess what? I'm pregnant!  I don't know who the father is because I'm a common whore too! Aren't you so proud?"|`|5070437d89b5a5c0baa621683e5f89f9aa	this is so bizarre I don't even believe it...  you need to have greater goals in your life, hon.   Too late now...for the next 18 years - your name is MOM.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Well, so much for the 'helpful' answers... O.o    Anyway, if it were me I'd probably tell them straight up that you're pregnant and that you aren't sure who the father is. I see no reason to tell them that you were TTC for so long previously, that would do nothing but make the situation worse for yourself. Unfortunately they're going to work it out eventually, and will probably be even angrier at you for trying to keep it quiet if you don't say something soon.  Perhaps having a third person there (obviously an adult like a school counsellor, trusted family friend or something similar) that you've already told would be a good bet too, at least that way you have someone there that's on your side so that you don't feel like you have no options.  I would also be doing my best to let them know that you're willing to be responsible for the child and that you understand that things will have to change. Obviously you WANT this baby so saying to get rid of it is pointless. I would however definately recommend that you look into getting in touch with a counselling service who can help you through the rough times because there will be times where you need that help, and if your parents aren't supportive you won't be able to look to them for help.|`|76ac0856e7fef6bc3f67d84b2c345683aa	You are 17? Trying to get pregnant?!?!  Why would you wanna do that?  And sleep with random men...I think is the worst thing you could have done.   Uhm...again...are you 17?? :|  :-O|`|TlA2z5XJaa	You are a loser. I feel sorry for your poor fatherless baby : (|`|9ChgI0Hqaa	your quite digusting.    poor child.|`|uQyrxxmIaa	Damn ... Thats Type Crazy But Do What Yuh Think Will Have The Best Outcome.  Personally, i would tell my parents whether they were gonna b mad or not because its better they find out from u rather than someone else.|`|QEUMO02Xaa	first of all, go tell your parents that your pregnant,then after a few months you go get a DNA test cause that's the only way you can find or be sure who the father is|`|115BfzMFaa	First of all you should tell them straight up. Then get your mum of close family member, that is mature, to take you to the doctor and get a pregnancy test to make sure and then get a std test. Also get a scan and see how far gone you are. Then sit down and have a long long talk with your parents and maybe a professional about your behavior. good luck.
576a5e5060bb09bd6c667591037775e8aa	Stick to the routine, when he wakes at night go to him do not turn on any direct lights, and do not talk to him pick him up and give him a cuddle offer a him something to drink and then put him back to bed. and leave him.  this is a common occurrence but if yu make a big fuss he will just want the attention you may have to listen to him cry for a bit  but he will eventually sleep during the night.|`|AA12003963	I have a little glow worm for my baby. When she went through this, she's 4 months now, I would pick her up and rock her with her pacifier in her mouth until she was very drowsy, put her back in and turn her glow worm on again. It worked for me after a day or 2. Good Luck!|`|gJrHBtp1aa	Have you tried co-sleeping? For some women it works wonders others not so much.    I was one of the unlucky ones but it might work out for you|`|uhj76Fkpaa	When I faced the same problem with my little one the only thing I did was not to take him when he woke up.Leave him awake in his crib and he'll fall asleep again on his own.Or give him his nipple instead of feeding him so that he gets used to be fed before sleep time and them in the morning.My baby(4 1/2 months) is sleeping from 11pm to 9am without waking.  Good luck    I never meant to leave your baby scream!!!Of course this is not an option!
e39a79f6daf722c960330aea2db67b78aa	As long as you don't serve it super thick then there's no reason you can't. Just water/milk it down a little bit so that there's less chance of choking. Which is the only real concern with whole quick oats anyway.|`|576a5e5060bb09bd6c667591037775e8aa	I don't see why not, at nine months old they should be able to have food with some lumps in but just watch they don't choke on any bits that are to hard for them to swallow.|`|d5d3d49e305b06c6f5252e0d0508cd4baa	I would certainly think so.  My mother fed me from the pot before I was able to say dada and from the pot included everything from mashed potatoes to fish.  So much has changed today, that now they got us asking....  Use your good judgement.  Go light one seasoned food.  You baby will grow up to be strong and healthy.
14VY9VQCaa	get out more lol|`|AA10719402	No.. we are a buyer beware society.    Surely people have enough common sense to realize they can't determine the sex unless you are taking DNA from the baby or if you can determine it visually.    People who buy that stuff are fairly dumb in the first place... to put it bluntly.    If we start banning one thing, that opens our law system up to ban EVERYTHING. I wish more people understood this nowadays.|`|PrarLmbxaa	There are worse scams in the world.|`|TlA2z5XJaa	LOL. I bought one...... It was wrong......  Not the biggest waste of $45 ever, but it was pretty darn stupid    nothingconstant called me dumb :'(|`|AuC4qOxeaa	That's terrible, i really hate when people do that, they have no shame. It's like if they were conned like this they'd be pissed and it would be seen as a huge thing when the whole time there doing it to other people and they don't see how it's wrong. I can sympathize with the people who fall into these traps, me not being the brightest bulb in a pack can too be mislead to believe these things. Im not saying you have to be dense to fall for these things, even the smartest of people have been fooled.  I totally agree with you that there should be some sort of law against it, people who get caught doing things like this should at least have a fine to pay. It really is disgusting!|`|NWVosihkaa	There's one person on ebay saying if you pay a 1 then he'll email you one question n then by your answer determine whether you're having a boy or girl lol Think though of the amount of people who do go for it though, it may only be 1 but that all adds up over time!  As for selling tablets thats bad, do the people selling them even know whats in them?!
9CAXUgOZaa	I really don't like Ellerslie.    It sounds really weird to me. Although it wouldn't be too bad if she went by Elle or something.     I really, really like Elijah Beau. That's adorable.     I think the Beau and Belle thing is really cute. But that kind of puts a damper on the 'Elle' thing. "Elle Belle"...lol.     Saying it aloud though, Ellerslie isn't too bad, just with a different spelling. There;s too many L's and E's in my opinion. Maybe Elersly or Ellezly or Ellasley.... i dunno. I can't think of a nice spelling.     edit: actually, Ellersley is definitely best. IDK what I was thinking, lol.     Congrats:)|`|im3vWyv6aa	Very pretty name. I love unique names....    I think the "eigh" is too much. I can't decide between the "ey" and the "ie".... hmmmmmm .... I kind of think the "ey" looks prettier.     What do you think?    ps - I love Elijah too.     Best wishes.... Your babies are due on my Mom's AND my Niece's birthday.|`|bUcWxQqpaa	Mya Kassidy  Kashim Enzo  (Kash)  Kyesha  Kalia  Kaley|`|XUe07RPGaa	Elijah is a good name for a boy, but surely not followed by Beau?    And Ellerslie looks the best if followed by the name Belle.|`|gRnARw6Oaa	I think Ellerslie is the best spelling- it's similar to a name I really like- Ellerly.  I'm thinking maybe Ellerslie Belle has too many "e" sounds in the name,and I would probably reconsinder the middle name choice.  Elerslie Brynn, Elerslie Briar, Elerslie Brooke (to keep the "B" in the middle.)  Also, I like Elijah Beau.|`|AA11138222	Ellersley would be my choice of spelling, but this name definately does not just roll off the tongue. I think somewhere around the "ersle" part of the name it becomes a tongue twister.|`|okgr5aPCaa	Elijah Beau is so cute.    I like Ellerslie Belle better :)    Ellerslie Belle and Elijah Beau, thats cute :)|`|l2fvNCDmaa	Ellerslie     I think that looks the best spelling and the one which most people would spell it as if they didn't know how to.     Love the name Elijah! My friend just had a baby and called her Evelyn.     Good luck with everything! Enjoy them while they are babies! :)|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	ellersley and elijah|`|4WPJrK9Jaa	how bout Romulus and Remus|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	Ellerslie definately. Ellersleigh is very long n quite an awkward spelling and ellersley just looks a bit more old fashioned and plain way of spelling. Ellerslie looks nicer and is a more modern way of spelling.|`|qBl07nnUaa	Wow, the girl's name is really hard to say. I would pick something a little more simple. I love the boy's name though.|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I love Elijah but not Ellerslie|`|ByWRzuuraa	I dont really like Ellerslie if im honest, its not really a name and doesnt sound right, People are never going to know how to say it :)  Elijah is very nice though.

I always wish i would have twins!  Do they run in your family or was it luck?
scdOdaTKaa	You definetly shoudl wait a couple more days, some women won't test positive that early.  That spotting could be AF coming or it could be implantation bleeding. So wait a few days see what happens, if nothing take  a test using the first response early results they are more sensitive to the hcg hormone.  Good luck!|`|se3RwEWyaa	I think you might have done it! Wait a week or so and get the early response test and re-test. Some of the hormone HCG does not show up in detectable levels until weeks after pregnancy. Hope this is your month!!! Lots of baby dust****|`|ZZfyRPRdaa	I really hope you are. ttc is a tough gig.  xx Tarzi
46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	once when i have a shower
3f0439ebe7cdf100832cada550ab973caa	You poor thing, I know exactly how your feeling.  Whilst pregnant with my now 11 week old beautiful little baby I suffered the flu, chest infections and even pneumonia.     A temp is generally regarded a temp when its 38 or 100.4  and any drop or high in your temp should be checked by a doctor, especially when pregnant.    Have some panadol, cool shower, drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest.  The best thing to do with a flu is sleep it out!!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	When I had the flu during pregnancy they told me not to go to urgent care unless I had a fever of 101 for more than half an hour.    It's stressful, but there's not much they can do for you.  The nurse I spoke to said it would be better for me to just stay home and in bed unless my fever spiked.|`|EAeffKqSaa	Two years ago when I was pregnant with my daughter I got really sick right before I had her. I had some the same symptoms as you and my temp got up too 101, all I did was take cold showers every 4 hours and drink lots of water.      I believe the doctors will tell you not to go over 100/101. It is all up to your doctors.     Don't worry you can't hurt the baby your body has a way to protect the baby so nothing can happen.

4e1nRQCUaa	humans are not designed for dating.  It screws with your natural brain chemistry and wiring.  More natural is to attach to a girl for life.  Maybe you will add others to your harem, but most guys wouldn't get the chance. At least, that's how it probably was 10,000 years ago.  When you see yours, or one of yours, wandering around, it speaks to you on a primordial level.  You can rationalize all you want, but the caveman in you will always make his voice heard.|`|p9SfW62kaa	Build up your self esteem. stop hating|`|wNWhGzjsaa	seems like u want attention from them.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	its normal. i would feel the same!!!. give it time!|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	Because you have low self esteem.

Ka52nbhNaa	I am so sorry to hear of your struggles.  The blighted ovum would not have had anything to do with a short luteal phase - just an unfortunate accident of nature - usually a result of a chromosomal defect in the cells.    It is possible that the shorter luteal phase could be a result of a hormonal imbalance like a progesterone deficit.  It is impossible to say whether or not that is why you miscarried the 3 time . . . I would consider asking your gp to check your hormone levels via blood test.  It is realatively easy to have done and most doctors can do it . . . you would not necessarily need a fertility specialist.      Best wishes & loads of baby dust to you!|`|zKDHetmEaa	Hey Honey,    Yep I think you could be right - I think this could be one problem for you.  I know vitamin B6 is meant to be great - taken in high doses...like 600mg per day is meant to be terrific at lenghtening luteal phases.    I think you should buy the book "taking charge of your fertility". I bought it, and in that it explains about the vitamin that you can take to lenthen your phase...but apart from that it is an excellent book to have, and I swear by it - the first month I bought it I got pregnant!!!!     Suze, I wish you a bfp again soon, and also I wish you the angel you deserve!!! I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers........xxx    Lots of love!|`|RE6GBw0Baa	hiya suze,    i think ur right about the leutal phases only affecting implantation, as once the egg has implanted and is a viable rpegnancy i dont see ow it woud affect it.    not that i know alot but its just my thoughts.     i would agree with foxy 2 that ur other 2 misscarriages are down 2 bad luck. i know its horrible 2 think that when ur desparate for an answer but i suppose that its a little reassuring thinking that there isnt a def problem that ur aware of that would make any further pregnancys difficult.    best wishes hunni xxxx|`|c1399de03ef647ddb85fb6f6fd6f6c2baa	Not that i'm an expert, but I think a 11 day luteal phase should be OK, as you did not have problems with your son, I think the 2 miscarriages would be put down to 'bad luck'.    If the luteal phase is less that 10 days, then a fertilized egg doesn't have chance to implant before the womb lining starts to come away.    I think you're gonna be fine, good luck x|`|yznZqcznaa	Hey Suze.  I actually do not think that a shortened luteal phase is much of a problem once you are further along.  I think the main thing is it not giving the egg time to implant before being removed.  11 days is ok because it takes on average 10 days for the egg to implant so you wont start your period and remove the pregnancy prior to that happening.  In some cases it could pose a problem however I highly doubt it would be a cause of your second miscarriage. One thing to look at though is your thyroid.  You shortened phase could be a result of a hormonal imbalance from the thryroid and that could cause you to miscarry because of other hormones being off, making it hard to carry the baby.
c97b62c8660b1041d9759f33d466797faa	i got pregnant after 8months of trying...i used to be so much like you, so badly desperate for a baby...don't stress too much, when i started to focused on myself getting healthy and fit for the baby first, i got pregnant..i just got into a walking program and tried to lose some wieight and then i got my bfp...you won't get pregnant with that high level of stress i your body, it just wouldn't work...    it happened just recently hun, i'm 3 weeks on the way now...i say do your homework(sex and the stuff), and wait and pray...try not to think about it so much...i know it's easier said than done, but believe me, you can...    a lot of sex is good when your ttc..no, it won't cause any early miscarriage...    it will happen when He permits it...    God bless hun!|`|ZZfyRPRdaa	Hi Anna  Being nervous about a negative prenancy result is completely natural and very unlikely to affect your chances of actually getting pregnant. But if you are so anxious that you are having physical effects, like nausea, loss of appetite, insomnia etc. your hormone balance and your chance of conceiving may be affected. Eat well, exercise in moderation and just try to keep yourself healthy. Talk to your partner or a close friend about it if you need to - you don't have to wear the worry on your own.  You'll be fine - there is always a way!!!  Tarzi|`|Lck9Fg04aa	sometimes some woman just find it really hard to get pregnant. dont give up though no matter how emotional it can make you.    well, if it comes up again try start preparing your body- start taking vitamins- exercise but not to a point that its extreme.    when your body is under stress you will somtimes find that it even upsets your actual period.  so when you stress yes it can delay/ interfere with your chances of concieving, i know its hard but try not even think about getting pregnant- and it might just happen when you least expect it    sex is considered safe during pregnancy- unless you have complications with the placenta- or it hurts- so no i dont think sex would cause a mis carriage at all    good luck!!|`|f4422f216561e6952afc8a35de25e36baa	I'm not sure if you have medical insurance or not.  But if possible go to a doctor that specializes in this problem.  There are doctors who can help a couple have the best chance of conception if only you can see one.  And a doctor like that would accurately answer all you questions.  Go to your regular doctor first; and get a reference to see the right doctor to help you out.|`|scdOdaTKaa	I don't think sex can cause an early miscarriage.  But stress/anxiety can.  You need to try to distract yourself and calm down. Being stressed can influence the pregnancy and if you aren't pregnant it can delay the start of your next AF which will mess with you emotionally.  So take up a hobby or something, and try not to think about it.  Good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|TlA2z5XJaa	Took us 4 cycles to conceive, just when I was starting to think there was something wrong with me. Just keep at it, it will most likely happen soon. I don't honestly believe that anxiety would stop you getting pregnant but it doesn't help the waiting times and sex should not cause a miscarriage. Good luck!!
576a5e5060bb09bd6c667591037775e8aa	Things will get easier once they all sleep through the night possibly when the last one goes to school, it is different for every family.    why are you up every hour at three months old a baby should be going at least 2-3 hours without a feed are you brest or bottle feeding and after each feed is the baby getting rid of all there wind? I have a four week old baby andshe was waking up every hour until I realised that she had a major case of wind after one boob and sometimes it takes her ages to get the wind up sometimes 1/2 and hour.  Once I realised this I was able to make sure that she burps after every feed and now she sleeps well at night.    at least during the school year you only have two at home that takes some of the pressure of you for a few hours any way.  does your toddler sleep during the day? If they do then you should leave your house work (it will still be there next month) and sleep while both of them are asleep.    before my baby was born I and 5 year old was at school ( she only starts full time this year) I was able to put my toddler into day care one day a week and then I had a day to sleep, shop, catch up with house work, or friends whatever it was good.  We have sinced moved away from the day care and now they are all home as it school holidays here and that has made it tuffer, but I am definately going to enrol my todler back into care once school goes back, which will just leave me with baby so I can catch up on sleep my self.    if you cant afford care can you not get a relative or friend to take care of the older children so that you can get some sleep? or what about your partner if you have one, when he is home can like on the a saturday or sunday can he not take them out for 3-4 hours while baby is sleeping or just look after them for you at home while you get some sleep?    good luck and hope you get into a routine soon and it does get easier.|`|lFPsPzxzaa	they are at such different ages it's hard to tell|`|d5d3d49e305b06c6f5252e0d0508cd4baa	I know the feeling.  Well, having the kids is a choice you make and a sacrifice too.  You just have to make up your mind to do what you have to do.  How about sharing the responsibilities with your partner?  If your partner is not available, then you should treat yourself to an occasional treat - have someone babysit for a day or two so that you can get rested, beautified...whatever you makes you feel better.  Things get much easier once the kids can do things for themselves, like take a bath and brush their teeth.  Much better than that can not be promised.  You next real break will be once they are off to college.  Enjoy!|`|DIZKlxNraa	You should start a night time routine with your youngest one, that might help, also try not to play or anything during the night. I know it is tough, I olny have one child 8 months old and it is hard enough that I don't know if I want any more kids because of that.|`|tjLODo1Caa	Hubby needs to pull his weight. He works daily but you're on call 24/7! When he gets home, he needs to take over and let you have a good 4 hour sleep at least every second day and to do more on the weekends. You'll go mad if you don't rest!|`|lkLKx6v3aa	You need to not let the baby sleep during the day even though they want to since they have been up all night.  Keep her awake during the day for a couple days as much as possible and she will be tired come bed time.  It may be exhausting since you have already been up all night, but in a couple days of keeping her up her routine should change.  The point is as long as you keep letting her sleep the way she is during the daytime, she is going to continue keeping you up at night.  They tend to sleep at about 6-8 hours without waking up at about 5 months and then things will settle down.  Try keeping her up during the day today no matter how tired you both are and see how she sleeps tonight.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	Dear I totally feel you!I have a 3 1/2 yo, a 16 months old and a 4 1/2 months old.There's no way that you can sleep all the night through!I have managed to put my little one to sleep all the night through but my older ones wake up 1 time each at least. Maybe you should try not to put them for sleep during the day so that they will be tired when its sleep time.I also try not to go to their beds every time they wake so that they fall asleep again on their own. A friend of mine that has gone through the same with her 3 boys when they were little told me that I will manage to sleep normally when my little one becomes 4 yrs old!So good luck and take care!
eeRLckg5aa	I would, as long as he feels up to it. Isn't it after 24 hours they're no longer contagious? Just make sure he gets lots of rest when home, so his body has the energy to fight the infection.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Yes, provided he's well enough to cope and isn't infectious.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	The general rule of thumb is if after 24 hours on the antibiotics and the symptoms are basicly undercontrole it it safe to return to school. Most schools will adminiser the antibiotics providing you fill out a form at the office and provide the medication in its original container with clear instructions and your childs name on the container. Most pharmacys provide duplicate bottles for this perpose, one for home and one for school.|`|DtIcDLTcaa	yes as soon as the child is no longer infectious and has no fever.|`|xPTM7F8yaa	Are they still considered contagious?  If so, then no.  The last thing you want is to get other kids sick.  If they are not contagious, and if they are feeling up to it, then send them to school.|`|145f9a95b73fc930d5481d771b203c24aa	its according to the type of antibiotic.. some antibiotics taken twice daily and some others taken four or three times daily.. if he takes twice or three times daily why not??|`|gyzMxjAiaa	I'd ask the doctor, but generally it is OK for kids to go to school if they have been on the antibiotic for 24 hours.|`|AA11230809	yes|`|zrUbBiFdaa	if he has to take them while he's at school then just give the meds to the school nurse so he can just go to the nurses office and take them. it should be fine to take him to school, or if you feel worried just make him go half a day so he can get all of his homework.|`|ykCo6SDOaa	Taking antiobiotics is not so much the issue unless they are making him have diarhhea (which can develop after a few doses from some kinds of antibiotics)     It is more about what the problem is he is taking the treatment for and is it infectious, and does it affect him/make him feel ill.    If he has few symptoms, feels OK and not infectious - and he wants to go to school it should be fine|`|bEVhDE9Raa	yes but tell the teacher that he's on them.
BQYXgtq7aa	I think its great you and your fiance are stepping up to the plate when these kids need it the most. They are probably unsure about their mothers death and will need care love understanding and patience. I think you should send your fiance to CA and collect the kids. Make sure they get to bring things back with them that   A) belonged to their mother (jewellery, clothing, bedding, photos, etc)   B) photos of themselves as babies  C) all their possessions.     Its a long way to fly, and I understand the lack of funds that you have.  It may put you all out financially for the time being but having the children with their biological daddy will be the benefit and in the long run, the money you are out will be minute and insignificant. These children need a stable environment NOW so they can grieve and move on with their lives. Has their mother had the funeral yet? Make sure they get a chance to say good bye and perhaps put a teddy or flower into her coffin.      Good Luck and I hope it all works out for you all. xox|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	I thought you said you have a good job and your husband too? What happened to being so well-off? Send your husband over to get them. No 3 year old should have to fly by themselves, even if it is allowed.|`|TlA2z5XJaa	The best thing to do would be to send your fiance over to get them, that way it hopefully wont be as scary for them the poor things.  If you truly cannot afford it then the staff will be attentive to them on the flight but they really are very very young (my daughter is 3 too) and will already be going through a lot right now with their mothers death.    Sending their grandma on the plane with them is a great idea|`|tn9sL3Ncaa	your partner should go over and fetch them they have already been through the mills with there mother dieing and they don't no there father he needs to go over and collect them you have it ruff, as it will be a whole different world and routine for them they need loads of love and attention. good luck|`|X1ACfL8eaa	When I was young I had to fly between my parents houses and I couldn't fly by myself till I was 6.Of course they started lying when I was 4 saying that I was six, but I don't think 3 yr. olds can pass for 6. Call the airlines and check. They will tell you the rules. Just try a few different airlines, and try not to get long layovers or plane changes if they fly by themselves.|`|cg3IaThxaa	If grandma's too old to take care of them, do you think she is going to be able to fly across the country twice? no.  and 3 year olds are NOT permitted to travel alone. [duh you'd have to tell the plane people they would be alone, they probably can't even read!]  No your fiance should go over and get them. If you don't have money for plane tickets, how are you going to afford twins?  best of luck!! answer my question?|`|1uyhFsFsaa	i am surprised you can even ask that question. these children have just lost everything important in their lives and you can even contemplate putting them on a plane alone ARE YOU STUPID?  these children need all the love and support they can get are you really sure you two are able to give them that when you are able to ask such a stupid question?   you need to think long and hard about what you are doing and if you are up to the job   you are talking about two distraught children as if they are a possession   they are human beings that have had their lives destroyed can you give them what they need?    " she legally left them to him "   that is disgusting like an object not to mention they don't even know him or you     if you can pay for grandma to fly with them then you can pay for your fiance what is the difference who is on the plane it will still cost the same? this is all rubbish money is not an issue here is it? even i can see that you can't accept he slept with another woman and had these children even if you were on a break   give these kids a break and put them up for adoption at least they will be wanted without proof they belong to someone|`|irLnPW4aaa	I don't think that the airlines allow unaccompanied minors who are under something like 7 or 8 years old.      Either your fiance needs to fly out and pick them up, the grandmothers friend (the current caregiver) needs to fly with them then back home, or you need to find someone else to travel with them.   If you cant afford the airfare, drive.    Instead of your fiance flying out and back in the same day, or having teh caregiver fly out and back in the same day, I would suggest that fiance spend a few days with the kids while they are stil with the current caregiver to give them a little bit of time to transition ...bad enough that they lost their Mom, but such a fast transition again now might be really traumatic for them.    And once they are with you, I'd suggest that you and DF go for a least a few counseling sessions with them...they are going to be upset at losing Mom and now going to live with someone they don't even know might be a very hard transition for them.    Good Luck, and thank goodness that they at least have somewhere to go.|`|AA10167940	Depending on the airline, children cannot fly unaccompanied until they are 5 or 6.      Something does not sound quite right about this situation...|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	how old are these girls.. you said he never saw the woman again, but has he ever spent time with the girls.?    it is going to be very upsetting to them to all of a sudden have a strange man show up and take them to a new place to live.    what really needs to be done is for him and/or you go out there and spend time with the girls..to get to know the girls before they come here..    you could try the red cross and see if the can help.. you never know, they might have some ideas.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	have your fiancee fly to get them! they are only 3 and their mommy just died...plus 3 year olds can't fly alone...even with a flight attendant watching them.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	Um, send your fiance to get them!  Why in the WORLD would you want to fly two three year olds BY THEMSELVES across the country?    Unaccompanied minors are usually okay, but I'm sure there is a minimum age you have to be.  Something tells me it would be a red flag for two three year olds to be on a plane by themselves.  Also, the flight attendants can not wait in the terminals with them, so they would be by themselves.    Eta: If you don't have money for airfare for yourselves, how, exactly, do you plan on flying two three-year olds and a grandmother across the country, and then flying the grandmother back?  Same cost there, dear.  However, I see what you're saying.  It would be much less frightening to ride to a new home with someone you already know.  Is their grandmother going to be able to stay with you guys for a little bit, while the girls adjust?  It's going to be very weird for them to live with a man and a woman they've never met and now they're calling mommy and daddy.  So having grandma stay for a while might be in their best interest.

UBK8U8hgaa	Your 9 weeks, usually sonograms are more accurate|`|pOCabUMvaa	Honey, as a proud mumsie of an 11 year old daughter, our only one, when we found out we were pregnant with her, we had a due date of July 4th, 1997, and we stuck with that, and it looked like I was going to give birth on that date, but she did not want to come out, she was late, it was all up to her, and it will be up to your child when he or she wants to come out.    My "baby" was born on July 12th, 1997, and we were happy that she finally decided to come into the world!!!!!    Just stick with your "due date", and take care of yourself and get baby names, and books and do not forget to take your prenatal vitamins!!!!!!    Don't worry so much about when you will have your baby, just enjoy your pregnancy, eat right, get plenty of rest, and your baby will come into the world when he or she feels like the time is right!!!!!    My daughter was born on my brother's birthday!!!! Sure, July 4th, would have been nice, LOL, but on my brother's birthday, cool!!!! :-)|`|cbVeIB4caa	Well if your 11 weeks then that makes you about 2 months and 3 weeks pregnant|`|0JDGHouKaa	I just had my 2nd ultrasound done a few days ago.  On my first visit I was told my due date is June 7th, which would make me 22 weeks now.  So when my 2nd ultrasound came along, he took measurements of my baby and said that I was within 1 day on either side of my due date.  This means that my babies development was pretty much on target with my due date.  He said they go as far as 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after.  So in your case your 11 weeks pregnant said your due date but your growth of your child looks to be only 9 weeks...(2 weeks before).  Anyway, my doctor said and I've heard it before that first time moms usually run past there due date. Don't worry to much about it, he/she will come when he/she wants to ha-ha!!      I hope this helped!!!!     Best wishes!|`|fBhXFLSUaa	im the exact same they count from the first day of your last period so i was given me date taught i was 16 weeks but at my scan the other day they said i was only 14 week and 4 days a difference of 10 days when i asked how the dates differ they told me that they always count from the first day of your period but some women concieve a week or two after its so my second date given is the acurte one.    Hope this helps|`|CvzATftSaa	I had a similar situation just a few weeks ago. We found out the same day (as you) that I was pregnant. When I went to my doctor, he estimated my due date as August 10. When I had my ultrasound and they measured the baby, they changed it to August 19. So instead of being 13 weeks along, I'm only 11 weeks. Today, the nurse tried to tell me I'm only 9 weeks along. I'm going to stick with August 19 and hope this child is ready to come into the world. Good luck with your pregnancy. I think it is by far the coolest thing I've ever been through.

I knew they were ready when they had a dry diaper ffor hours, they told me instantly when they went and hated the wet feeling in the diaper.

tWP8GDyGaa	Most of the time rice cereal is suggested first because it is bland and has the lowest rate of allergic reactions.  As you said you know about the 4-5 day thing.  So my suggestion is cereal, then a veggie.  I usually suggest veggies before fruit, because as humans we tend to have a sweet tooth, formula and breast milk believe it or not have a sweet taste and if fruits are introduced before veggies parents usually have a hard time getting them to eat veggies.  Try once a day at first and work up to three times a day.  Yes, it is important that she drinks formula 28-38 oz until about 9 months then the average amounts are 24-32 oz.  Before, during, or after really doesn't matter, that would be more of a preference that you or she has.  Good luck!|`|723QHuicaa	First baby meal was baby porridge, 2nd was mashed banana, from there we gave her 1 new fruit / veg per week.

Give her more milk - every day you wait on the solids makes it less likely that she will develop diabetes or become obese later in life.    Once she is six months old, then you can start with rice cereal or fruit or veg. There's no law says you have to start with cereal. Once a day, a tiny taste, and always on a spoon, never mixed in the bottle.|`|VClxXNs3aa	I didnt feed my baby cereal at all.  she is 10 months and I am holding off all grains, mea,t and dairy til she is a year old at the least. I went to feeding fruits and veggies at 6.5 months.  I breastfeed her on demand as well so I dont track her intake of milk, either.    I would do once a day and then after that you can go to twice a day, whatever you are comfortable with.  you shouldnt force her to finish a whole jar either.  she just needs to learn new taste and textures and how to eat....  they shouldnt really be relied on as nutrition at this point.|`|1SlD1kZ2aa	my son was on cereal only for about a month before introducing vegetables.  then it was a month of vegetables and cereal before adding fruit.

kprKXEOSaa	It's totally normal to doubt, especially if you've been trying to conceive for a long time!  If you've done 6 tests and the lines are getting darker, you're pregnant.  If you're like I was when I was going through infertility, now is the time to stop despairing you will never get pregnant (congratulations!) and time to start worrying nonstop about the baby and the labor and delivery!  The worry never ends!  Good luck!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	If you took 6 tests and they all came back positive, then chances are you are positive. The rate of failure for a pregnancy test showing a positive is low, and they are usually accurate as long as your period is late.     Go buy a digital one like clear blue easy  Call your doctor for a blood test    The only thing I can think of that may show a positive and not be a real pregnancy is a Chemical pregnancy or a molar pregnancy. Call your doctor.    Stop worrying, you are probably expecting!!!    Good luck!|`|Lck9Fg04aa	hunny relax your pregnant!!!!!!!! trust me.  all 6 of your tests were positive + you hardly EVER get false positives, + all test do the same thing- no matter how cheap they are.    the line keeps getting darker cos your hcg level is increasing, (this it the hormone a test picks up)    relax and cogradulations|`|c1399de03ef647ddb85fb6f6fd6f6c2baa	You're pregnant, don't worry!

You are definitely pregnant =]|`|ycdkngxlaa	If you have had six positives already then it is highly unlikely that they are wrong.

I did the same thing! I took about 20 tets last week all positive.

I was so scared I was gonna go in on monday and they were gonna be like your not pregnant. WELL turns out my blood test monday was def. positive!!!!! So hang in there!

Try keeping your 8 month old awake longer during the day so he might sleep better during the night,  if your children are waking up, try a sleep music cd so that they fall asleep to it and listen to it while they are sleeping so it blocks out most other noises, and dummies are also an option.|`|ruGhNDmUaa	You can try to enroll your kids in daycare a couple days a week, to give you time to get a few things done.  Also look for a Mom group in your area.  That way you can maybe meet some people in the same situation as you.  Also You might be able to set up where you swap babysitting at no charge.  If none of these things are an option, you need to talk to someone about how over whelmed you feel, maybe a base chaplin or counselor.|`|OMOuxROoaa	well you could hire a nanny to help......or what about taking your older kids to a playgroup for a while during the day....  I know things seem hard but you will get through it. First i don't know how old your other kids are so it makes it hard to make suggestions. Relax is first...children can feel when you are stressed in turn making them stressed out and crying. Next set up a schedule your 8 month old should be sleeping a little more during the night and could be a result of missing dad too....but maybe push his bedtime up a half hour and give him more solids closer to bed time he may sleep longer. Try and get all your kids on the same nap schedule by saying it is nap time (work it around the babys time) and lay down and watch movies. When your son dumps the laundry explain to him it is wrong. He still can have a "time out" even 2 minutes will show him you mean buissness. Give them something to do to either help or keep them busy while you clean. take kid time for an hour a day and play with them. make cleaning into a game even. once you get your house clean pick up constantly....when you use a dish wash it.....when one load of laundry is ready do it....put things away as soon as you are done and teach the kids they can not play with something else till they put something away. By keeping up on your house it will not get so trashed. caffine will help. I have three boys and there is no right solution for every kid is different. Try to not stress so much and it will help x100.|`|Zgs4RncIaa	Honestly you need to pull yourself together. I know it must be very hard with your husband being deployed, but you have children depending on you.   Your 8 month old should be sleeping throughout the night. You may want to consider formula and give him some baby cereal before he goes to bed. Also wait to bath until right before bed time, make sure the bath water is luke warm (help to get them sleepy)  You not sleeping through the night is making it harder to get through the day.  As far as napping when your kids are, great idea!. Shut off your phone, put a note on your door DO NOT DISTURB, and get a muzzle for the dog!
VMASMHX6aa	It doesn't matter that you are still bleeding. Test anyway. You may not find that you get a positive for a number of days. Testing on day 7 is really insurance as some women with a 24 day cycle may ovulate as early as this, but for others will the same cycle it will be a few days later.|`|7AYnWg3paa	just have sex....dont chart or anythingg unless u are having problems...it will just backfire on u|`|Hu9yquP4aa	With my daughter I ovulated 5 days after my period ended.

y1BjjH10aa	she is getting used to you being there, you need to put a stop to this asap or it will only get worse. It may be that her teeth have started it but whatever the reason do as you did last night. You need to be firm. As you have seen she will go to sleep evenually and it will get easier|`|723QHuicaa	Comforting - Good.    Lifting her out of the cot - Bad.    Go in, talk to her, hold her hand, stroke her face etc - but dont lift her.    Its sounds like your against CIO, me too. But comforting your child while they cry is not CIO. My daughter does this from time to time for a few days, Ialways relate it to teething.|`|8wnvhBQTaa	I had this problem with my daughter when she cut her first tooth, she ended up sleeping in our bed for about a week but every night I would also try and put her in her own bed.  Once the tooth came through she went back to her normal routine, I am dreading the rest of her teeth coming through  Everyone will say it is bad to lift her but I lifted my daughter and comforted her until it passed and she went back to sleeping in her own bed so do what is right for you and your baby.  Her twin brother just whimpers in his sleep when teething.    It sounds like your daughter just wanted comforted hopefully it will pass.|`|07e1041f41de92a29534cc87d6f3c8d8aa	You have already found the solution - if she went to sleep after only 15 minutes, then she is capable of getting to sleep without your help.  I bet if you stayed and cuddled her to sleep, it took just as long if not longer.    Teething might be causing her to wake up again - look for lotions on the market which help with the teething pain, use them before sleeptime.|`|Anl6kmokaa	you should by her a small lamp but not near her cot don't have the big light on as she will not sleep and when she crys just leave her for about 10 mins if she dosent stop the go and see to her but dont get hehr out that is what she wonts|`|xy0W50Lqaa	I get this problem too.  I have a lullaby light thing that shines shapes onto the ceiling while playing music.  My daughter likes this and sometimes gets her to settle in her cot.  She goes ballistic if I leave the room but she's not used to going to sleep on her own (something I should have worked on months ago but took the easy option of her sleeping in my arms!)   Plan B for me is sitting her in her bouncy chair in the living room with us, lights dimmed and she goes to sleep then
8pLDp9rOaa	There could be other reasons for this but these are definitely symptoms of early pregnancy.  When your next period is due, if it doesn't arrive take a test!    Good luck!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I knew the day after we conceived. I told my husband we were pregnant because i felt dizzy, nauseous and my breasts started to hurt.

It can happen :)  Good luck!|`|4XfjUcvDaa	Take a test to be 100% sure.|`|roPhZmskaa	take the test and you'll know for sure|`|lFPsPzxzaa	yes it is possible i was just 3 weeks prego when i found out that i was and i had morning sickness that lasted all day and tender boobs along with wanting to sleep allllllllllllllllllllllllllot
kprKXEOSaa	The luteal phase is the time between ovulation and the onset of menstruation, basically the last half of the menstrual cycle.  If your luteal phase is too short, it makes it difficult to get pregnant, because if there is a fertilized egg, it doesn't have time to implant and it basically gets flushed out when your period starts.|`|se3RwEWyaa	While estrogen dominates the pre-ovulatory, follicular phase of your cycle, progesterone dominates the post-ovulatory, LUTEAL PHASE of your cycle. Before ovulation, progesterone is present only in very small amounts. After ovulation (luteal phase), progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum (the remains of the ovarian follicle after ovulation), and is present in dramatically higher amounts. Progesterone plays the following roles:   Progesterone makes the lining of your uterus soft and spongy so that a fertilized egg can latch onto it and implant.   Progesterone is needed to support and sustain pregnancy.   Progesterone causes your Basal Body Temperature (BBT) to rise after ovulation so that it is measurable with a BBT thermometer.   Progesterone causes your BBT to stay elevated throughout pregnancy. Your Leutal Phase will last from confirmed Ovulation until conception or you AF begins. The rise progesterone levels marks confirmed Ovulation. Lots of luck and baby dust****|`|DDswEgtZaa	phase after you have ovulated, usually lasts 14 days before your period.

cst2MA8uaa	I went through the same thing with my pregnancy. From what the doctors told me, a very faint line could mean a few things;     1. My Bhcg (hormone levels you get when you're pregnant) was very low, which is what the pregnancy test tests for,  and if they are under a certain amount it is not a viable pregnancy. Mine were extremely low but I am definately 15 weeks now with a healthy baby.  2. You're body is producing the hormone due to an ovarian cyst and you might not be pregnant.  3. The reason for my low levels and faint line was the fact that I was in the very early stages of pregnancy.    Also, if you had your period and only lasted a few days and now you are showing positive pregnancy, it is possible you had a miscarriage and just thought it was your period.  So don't get excited yet, especially if you have a history of miscarriage like me. If you are pregnant it will be a very nervous 10 or so weeks for you as you've lost a baby before, so just try to relax!  Hope this helps and I hope it all works out for the best for you!  Good Luck!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I had my period for the first 3 months of my pregnancy with my daughter. I also had a faint line on my tests due to low hormone levels.     You sound pregnant to me.     Good luck!|`|cbfb39e3aab3b803822e39f849209291aa	I not sure as never been preg but i have heard it more common to get false negatives than false positives.  I would say that you stand a good chance of being pregnant but like you have said youself best not to get all your hopes up until the doctor confirms everything for you.    Good luck|`|Lck9Fg04aa	i would say conception had to occure somewhere for the test to show up positive as false positives are rare!(faint or not)     some women experience there period for some months when pregnant (especially those who were on the pill, or fell pregnant while taking the pill)     wait for your doctor app. so he can examine you    good luck
NWVosihkaa	I had my wee girl at 35 weeks n she was 5lb 12 which I was told was a really good weight for being so early. So your baby is about 6lb which sounds really healthy, even if it might seem a wee bit heavier than average just now the baby's weight gain can slow down over the next few weeks.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	well, basically 1 kg is 2.2 lbs and your baby is almost 6 lbs and you still have 6 weeks. So I say no, in the next 6 weeks you will gain 3/4 lb a week.|`|07e1041f41de92a29534cc87d6f3c8d8aa	What did your midwife / doctor say?|`|AA10762544	Your Baby is Ok and on normal weight for the age. Am 35 + and my baby weighed 2.8kg at 34 and my doctor said we are doing great.|`|PAdif484aa	I think that is about 6 pounds. Pretty normal...maybe a little big. The baby should gain about 0.5 pounds per week or 0.227kg per week. Sorry, I'm in the  U.S. :)|`|AsICkz9naa	2.8kg is over just 6 pounds. That's a good size weight. Your baby is doing well, please don't worry. It may well be a baby weighing over 7 pounds at birth. Enjoy the rest of your pregnancy and don't worry.
VMASMHX6aa	The nationality of your parent company is irrelevant. British law applies here.  If you were working for the company for at least a month before your partner fell pregnant then you are entitled to 2 weeks leave which is paid at about 112 a week.   Your company might be offering you 2 days at full pay, but you can also take these 2 weeks.|`|3y96DmJdaa	Well i thought if they are in the UK it has to be UK rules, of not that unfair, its not like you are in another country|`|hieQHR0daa	Go see the HR dept and ask them The answer will depend on whether the company employed you on a Dutch or UK contract but you do need clarification. Your boss is winding you up.|`|x0bJmyDPaa	The Dutch are notoriously tight with money - but if they're in the UK then they have to follow UK law, which no doubt they'll do but only to the minimum requirements.  I'm not sure what the entitlements are in the UK, but I'm pretty sure it's a damn sight more than 2 days.
145RUNQHaa	Hello.i think to get children to listen it s all in the tone of voice you need to keep your tone as though you are on their side and give them choices.for example my daughter is not keen on baths when it is time for a bath i don t say it s time for a bath and expect her to get in straight away i say would you like to go and choose which bath toys you want in your bath and which bubble bath you would like today?that way you are saying it s bathtime but are giving options children then believe they have a little control.when it s time to get dressed lay out two or three outfits and say would you like to choose what to wear today and get dressed?whatever you do don t turn any situation into a battle of wills this will make any child stubborn.the naughty corner or step i don t believe in i like to call it breathing space instead.banishing your child to another room teaches nothing and leaving them to stand in a corner is cruel and humiliating.if i am ever in a situation where i have to say no to my daughter and she will not accept it i sit her down and with a colouring in or activity and i explain one last time why she can t do/have whatever it is and she knows from experience that is the end of it.she may well cry for a bit or sometimes she does the colouring in.a short time later we have a hug.you do have to be consistent on this.if you want her to listen when you are out keep your cool ask her to do things in a positive tone of voice and make outings enjoyable and get her to help you with the shopping or whatever you are doing and praise her for being good and hopefully she will start to respond more positively.|`|Z45YUKesaa	Time outs are very effective if you stay consistant. If you don't stay consistant they will never work and your little one WILL become queen of the castle and you will become merely a servant. Trust me!|`|kprKXEOSaa	I've got one like that, too.  You have to be firm, especially if she's having tantrums, and not give in.  Just remember you're the adult.    You may also need to take a look at your behavior in relation to your daughter's.  Are you trying to do things on the computer, for example, when she acts up?  I find that my kids behave badly when I've not given them enough attention for too long.  Little kids don't understand e-mail or my obsessive need to answer questions on Y!A, or reading the paper, or about anything else I think is important that takes my attention away from them.  I also find it helps to kneel down on their level and talk to them.    Good luck!|`|VClxXNs3aa	STOP YELLING.....?|`|y1jRV0I4aa	Don't panic, even though it's stressful it's normal for children around that age to be stubborn and have attitudes to a point. A lot of it comes from that they are at that age where they want to do everything on there own, and don't want to be told what to do otherwise!      What you need to do, if you haven't already....is make a time out!  It's better to start the idea of consequences sooner then later. Meaning...if you don't listen to me your going to get something taken away OR sit a few minutes in time out each time. ( whichever you feel would work better)       At this age it's crucial you explain everything to them. If she does not listen to you, give her a warning and ask her again...explain to her that if she doesn't listen she is going to get sent to time out. You have to be consistent with it too! If you let her get away with one thing, she will think she can get away with another.    Be firm, but not harsh. She will learn in time that if she doesn't listen or do what you want she is going to get in trouble because you are the boss, not her!    It might not work the first few times, but don't give up. Be strong and good luck! =]|`|tn9sL3Ncaa	im at the same stage with my daughter i use the naughty corner it works! you tell them 3 times not to do something and if they do it the 4 time you put them in the corner, they think they have the ability to go about life by the self which we no they don't my daughter quite likes at the minute helping mummy do things like washing the pots, putting her toys away so i encourage her ignore the bad behavior and reward the good. its hard ive invested in a super nanny book that i refer to when she starts doing things
kprKXEOSaa	Women have gotten pregnant having unprotected sex at every time during the menstrual cycle.  During your period, it would be highly unlikely, but it is possible.  If you really don't want to get pregnant, you should be using a condom all the time, every time.  You'll have to wait until your next period starts, to be sure.|`|wENdWT5kaa	Its' all in your imagination.     First, tho possible, chances of you being pregnant while on your period, is very slim. Second, if you do end up pregnant, you are not pregnant YET. It's only been a week, implantation hasn't even taken place yet.   And if it has, way to early for symptoms.     The cramping is all in your head. If you don't want a baby, don't have sex. Simple.|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	you will have to wait until you miss your period & then take a test. You CAN get pregnant ANY time of the month.    good luck use protection!!!|`|AsICkz9naa	It's unlikely that you are pregnant. You ovulate at least a week or ten days after your period has finished.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I ovulated the day after my period ended. My period was 6 days long. I had sex the day it ended and was pregnant. So yes, as long as you are ovulating, you can get pregnant.     Take a test when you miss your period.
uhj76Fkpaa	When doctors aren't sure of the baby gender they tent to tell that it's a girl.When you'll have the next ultrasound you'll know!If she tells you that it's a boy then its for sure!  Take care|`|DZzBfzVeaa	With girls i dont think anyone can be 100% because if you cant see a penis that doesnt mean that one isnt there, that just means he's hiding it. I do think however that if  you are 21 weeks along that you are definetly far enough to know but i think i would wait if i were you just to make sure. I went and had a 4d ultra sound done at 18 weeks and found out i was  having a boy :) i then returned to my regular doctor visit at 22 weeks and without telling my doctor i had gone and had a 4d scan done she said i was having a girl, i told her she was wrong and showed her the 4d pics. She said its definetly a boy but because she only has a 2d scan its not very clear.  I just went back for my 27 weeks scan at the docs and she said she still cant tell if its a boy or girl. So im glad we went and got a 4d scan done to make sure!  you should maybe look into that or just wait it out.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Honestly? I was told my daughter was a boy at 20 weeks and then at my 35 week ultrasound they told me it was a girl.     Buy lots of yellow and green until baby is born. They can make mistakes!|`|ocwIcfzPaa	I don't think they can ever be 100% sure (and even if they were, they wouldn't tell you to avoid being sued!)     Why not get exited about having a boy anyway, then when baby is born, you will be prepared either way.|`|jchCJZxTaa	there are old wives tales that worked for my mums friends that told her if the baby was a boy or girl and they worked    here go to this site     http://www.childbirth.org/articles/boyor...      hope i helped!|`|5099ffc117e8dfe6b95f19667ddf615baa	They are usually right and the umbilical cord can never be misstaken for a penis so dont let anyone tell you that one either.I have had five boys and i have always heard 80% sure that its a boy and sure enough they were boys.You will most likely get another ultrasound before you have the baby so you can check again but most likely its a girl.Congrats and send some pink my way lol.|`|e39a79f6daf722c960330aea2db67b78aa	She has to tell you that she's 80% sure because if she's wrong.. you can't blame her. There's no way now for you to tell for sure unless you have another ultrasound, but at 21 weeks, the chances that she was right are about 95%.. The accuracy of gender determination by ultrasound is very good if all the parts are visible.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	My sister in law was told the same thing and she ended up having a little girl.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	The only way they can tell with 100% certainty is if they do an amnio, which is a test where they insert a needle and withdraw some of the amniotic fluid. They usually won't do an amnio to be certain about the sex though as it is a risky procedure sometimes and can cause miscarriage.   I agree, just get excited about having a boy and that way you'll be happy either way :D|`|AA10911598	There is never a 100% accuracy with ultrasound.  I have done ultrasound for the past 25 years.  When we get a good look at the gender we still could be wrong.  Males can have undecended testicles or the labia could be swollen and look like testicles.   The only way to know for sure is to wait until the baby is born.  If the technologist told you 80% for sure then she must have gotten a good look but did not see anything that looked like a boy.  Having another ultrasound is not appropriate to determine gender unless there is a medical need to have this procedure done again.  Girls are more difficult to be sure about.  Congratulations!|`|Kd1pt6dFaa	with my first I was told that she was 85% sure it was a boy..  85% wasn't good enough for me so I went for a 3D ultrasound and found out I was indeed having a boy..  I too have 2 boys so if someone says this one is a girl I will not believe them until I have a 3D..   They are a wonderful experience!|`|slzx5202aa	At my first ultrasound at 21 weeks the u/t told me that he was 80% sure i was having a boy, and then at another ultrasound 2 weeks later the u/t said you are 100% having a little boy because we could see his little ''dude'' on the ultrasound screen lol.
rPjgH9Mkaa	Well, you could just be stressed, but I would wait and see. Your birth control was so beyond not in effect though incase that was what you were wondering (sorry). As much as you might not want to get pregnant your body absolutely wants you to; in fact it tries to get you pregnant... that is just how our bodies work. Since you were supposed to get your period on the 23 you could have very well been ovulating around the 11th. There is a chance though that the stress of missing your period is making it take even longer to come. If anything, just take a pregnancy test to find out for sure. It would show up by now if you were. Good luck, and I hope that it goes well!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	If you were due the 23rd, you should take a HPT. You will be able to get an accurate test result.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	You may just be having a messed up cycle due to taking the pill and stopping like that.  It normally takes about 3 months to get the pill out of your system.|`|y1jRV0I4aa	That was all a bit hard to understand...    But seeings as you skipped pills and your fairly new to them anyways sounds like your cycle is in a bit of a fit. It's normal to spot the first few months you are on the pills as well....and because you skipped some that's most likely why you got your period.      It sounds like to be safe you need to go your doctor asap though. Explain all of that to them, and they will most likely run a pregnancy test just to be sure!
SnVwHG3iaa	Removal of the coil can confuse the body and send out hormones everywhere as its confused and trying to get itself back to normal.  There is a possibility that you maybe pregnant though as you've had unprotected sex and your chances of falling pregnant are high.  The best thing to do is wait and see if you come on your period, of not take a pregnancy test.    Best of luck xx
R1zUIh7taa	It could be a sign of implantation!  Good Luck!|`|cbfb39e3aab3b803822e39f849209291aa	Im due to start my AF tomorrow buti have been having cramping on and off for the last two weeks.  I haven't had any brown discharge which i normally get before my AF, i have been getting yellowish discharge.  I would say to try not to get your hopes up too much until you have a positive test result but it does sound promising.  I wont get my hopes up until i actually test positive lol dont get yourself worked up then.    Good luck|`|Lck9Fg04aa	yes it can be a sign- the discharge could be implantation bleeding where the egg attaches to the uterus wall and the cramps could be from implantation cramping.    however only a test can confirm it hun  good luck|`|ppMp9mcPaa	yes very much likely|`|N3fywkEfaa	It is a possibility and can definitely be a sign of pregnancy yes but best way to tell is a pregnancy test then if its negative see your doctor..|`|dxlNwGuWaa	I had cramping right up until my 6th week of pregnancy.  I had a previous ectopic and panicked everytime i got cramps!  But yes, it could be a sign of pregnancy.    However AF symptoms are so similar to pG symptoms, it is easy to get fooled.  Only way to know for certain is to test-if you are certain you ovulated 10 days ago, you may even be able to take an early detection test, however i'd advise waiting til 14 DPO to get an accurate result.  i got my bfp at DPO 12. Faint but unquestionable.    Good luck and Baby Dust!    xxxxxxxxxxxxx
GZdvHbT5aa	The other day, I was getting Sam ready for bed, and read him a book in our rocking chair, then turned off the lights and was going to rock him for a few minutes before I put him to bed. Normally I don't sing to him, but that night, I felt like singing him a sweet song, so I did. I sang for a few minutes, and then he sat up from my chest, took my face in his hands. He said "mommy" and I said "yes baby" and he said "hush" and laid back his head back down. I guess he doesn't like my singing very much.  Sam will be two in May!!!|`|eF6HTt0gaa	Both girls who are almost 7 and 4 put on an Air band show last night. My 4 yr old had made paper drums and a paper guitar in preschool the day before and was happy to share. They played Ba ba black sheep, row row row your boat and attempted to  do No body;s perfect by the dreaded Hannah Montana. We got tons of pics and had a blast.     To make it even better not long after the concert my youngest put on her princess purple ball cap and sunglasses and twisted the cap to the side turns around and said" Hey mamma yo yo yo" and threw me the Fist of rock hand symbol. I never laughed so hard in my life. And when she did it again I thought my husband was gonna fall down the stairs he was laughing so hard. Now Im trying to get her to do it again so i can get a pic of it and share but shes not interested.|`|5dca67bd0dd4aa9a8ea84176747ecb36aa	Bradley (19 months) was sitting at the dinner table and I must have said something funny because he looked at his father and with a big grin, said "she's so funny!"  We both looked at each other and just laughed.  Our pug was chasing her tail later in the evening and he laughed, then said, "beazy is crazy!"   His father loved it so much he said he wished he could have had it on audio and so he could use it as his ring tone for his phone.  Very cute.|`|TQScv7Tcaa	Hmmmm do i have to pick just one?????    Ok Charleigh is 16 months old and has taken to copying everything we say yesterday i was talking to her daddy, i didnt even know she was listening and i said "what am i going to give charleigh for dinner" (cos its really really hot here) and he said "i dunno" i walked into the lounge room and said "bubba what do you want for dinner?" (just sort of asking not really expecting an answer) and she said (in the EXACT same way her father had) "I DUNNO" then laughed her head off......it was probably one of those 'you had to be there type moments' but it was hiarious........|`|1bf2f9586d3ad537a73d55b79612e926aa	We are also stuck in the snow. Yesterday my 3 yr old found an old cell phone (without a sim card) and asked if she could play with it. Because it had no sim card I though it would be ok for her to pretend to phone and text ( she has a 14 yr old sister who is always texting) so all day she is pretending to text and having a big time .. that is until the police show up at the door.. seems even without a sim card it can still call 911.. which is just what she did. They were not nearly as amused as we were.|`|fMxVDps3aa	Mine say funny things all the time. We were on a fruit kick for a while making smoothies and such. My 7yr old asked if we had any fruit and I said no, we have canned fruit though not fresh fruit and she said Well do we have any old fruit. I thought it was funny.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	HAHHA!!!!   THATS TOOO FUNNY!  That reminds me of my little brother, he was probably about 2 at the time, and I remember my dad couldnt find Andrew anywhere!..great parenting i know lol  So we were all searching all over the freakin house, finally!! My dad says, hey come look at this..  We go look BEHIND the couch and there he is sleeping with a chocolate bar in his hand and chocolate all over his face!!  He was all scrunched between the wall and the couch, still makes me laugh LOL  But Brody, he seems to just want to make things more difficult for himself, lol  When he is walking around in the kitchen, and he comes to the chair, instead of continuing walking, he decides he will crawl..through all the chairs! Up and over every little bar that is going horizantol connecting from the legs of the chair, and so far he has gotten stuck a couple times, but he insists this is the way to get around the kitchen!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	LOL!!!    I am sooo going to get thumb's down for this (bad, bad mommy) but here goes anyway.... Speaking of chocolate.... I gave Connor his cup of milk last night and he started throwing a fit (recent thing- fun).  He pushed it away and said "cha-cha".  We started cracking up laughing (and didn't give in, btw, lol).  He's only had chocolate milk once (unless he's had it at nana and papa's) but he sure must like it!!  His vocabulary is very limited still so the fact that chocolate was one of his first words makes me think he's going to take after me, hee-hee.    Aidan said something last night- what was it?!!!  OH, he had a (real) stethoscope that my mom gave him (he thinks he's a doctor) and he put it up to my chest and said, "momma, I think you have diarrhea".  It was soooooo funny!!|`|M6c0hUefaa	LOL, that's so cute.    Well, my daughter is 10 months and hasn't done anything too silly lately, but she's started saying HEY! to everyone and everything. If we go outside and she sees the dogs she goes HEY! and points at them, it's too cute.|`|r07BwhO1aa	LOL    I am a full time college student and take my education very seriously, so I type my notes at night so they are legible, I print them out, and put them in my folder. I punch holes in the paper and use reinforces on the holes so the paper will not fall out (yes I know I am a geek) I was doing this the other day and my daughter who is 8 asked me what the reinforces were for, I told her they were so the papers did not fall out so easily and this is what she said in a very dead pan dry sarcastic way:    "Are you afraid ninjas want to steel your folder? Lot of ninja attacks at your school?"  I almost choked on my coffee I started laughing so hard!!!    My daughter did something like your son did when she was 3 though, my husband was in Iraq and it was around the holidays and my mom was making Amereto cakes  (contains bunches of liquor) and we were in the kitchen talking and baking and we looked into the dinning room and saw my then 3 year old daughter sitting in the middle of the table stuffing her face with the cakes my mom had put out to cool!!  She had taken handfuls out of 4 of them!!  Her face was dripping with the sugar frosting my mom uses!!  It was too funny!!|`|W8UZebRWaa	My son (21 months) is into putting on hats. So the other day he took my James Dean hat and it was so big that it covered his eyes. He knew I was going to fix it so he took off running and somehow or another he missed every wall and toy in the house.  Silly kids!|`|j2mRop0laa	We were at the store last night and hardly no one was in there. It was about 8pm and school had been canceled for today, already.    My oldest was doing some little dance in the aisle while I'm standing there reading an ingredient list on something. My youngest starts copying her and my oldest (she's 10) says "Almost right, Sis, just really put your butt into it!" and starts to show her how. Right then, an elderly couple walk through our vacant aisle and start laughing. My daughter goes bright red and said, "I should learn to control myself." LOL|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	We put a little camera in Chase's room so when he runs in there we can watch him from a monitor in the living room and see what he does.  So, he started talking about a book.  I told him to go into his room and get his book.  He went into his room and crawled underneath his crib.  He brought out a book!  It was funny.  And Mason just screams with joy all day.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	I don't have children, but I have to say that is really silly!  That's so cute.    When we visit my cousins, they're obsessed with my mom.  She does lotion after she gets a shower, and my cousins Bridget and Shay love doing this.  They get a little bit of lotion to put on arms and legs each.  So we were in the grocery store and I picked up a bottle of ranch dressing.  Shay, being one and a half, wanted to have something to hold the whole time, so I gave her that.    Next thing I know, she's trying to get the darn thing open to put it on her legs because she thought it was lotion!    I laughed at her and she looked up at me with this HUGE smile.  She's such a funny little girl.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Awww, Silly Johnny!!    I recently put a Thomas the Tank Engine up on a shelf due to an unacceptable behaviour. They took the breakfast bar stools, and one stood at the doorway looking out, one at the base of the stool, and one climbing the stool, to get it.   They are just full of mischief like their father. I most certainly wasn't like that.    They didn't realise, I was in the kitchen watching them.
d1099196c69e4cab121ff3fed73860e9aa	it became a bad word when people got anal retentive about calling any reproductive or "private part" by it's real name. Sounds like a MIL offensive opinion lol|`|yjDAg8v7aa	I agree with you! Our son is only 16 months old, but my husband has taught him to call his bottom his bobo. I think it's silly so I still refer to it as a butt or his bottom. When I was teaching preschool I would use the word bottom because I wasn't sure what 20 2 year old's parents were calling it. But...my husband was telling me about a woman he dated who had a little girl who refered to her privates as her 'cookie.' I think it's absolutely ridiculous! An arm is an arm. A leg is a leg. Your head is your head. Your butt is your butt. And...like it or not a vagina is a vagina. I think it's wrong to make our children feel ashamed for actually knowing their body parts, but that's just me.|`|gt9fKxkBaa	I taught my daughter to say "booty, booty, booty" really fast.  I think it is too funny when she does it.  A whole lotta people really do need to lighten up.  If you make a big deal of something then the kid will develop a complex.  I firmly believe in not caring what people think.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Great question!!!!    I taught my oldest to say 'bottom' but I never corrected him when he got a little older and said butt.  I wonder why I did that in the first place?!!  lol    I found out he got in trouble for saying 'fart' yesterday.  I'm still trying to figure that one out.  I know there are better words but come on!!|`|EtCRnDJMaa	when they are in pre school or even daycare & school too the teachers will say to the children "Please sit on your bottoms"  for times when they are on the bus or on the rug for story time.  Bottom sounds better than butt. And the Kindergarten & 1st grade kids sometimes laugh at butt. Some are fast to say it's bottom & correct you when you slip.        It's really no big deal to me either.  They just do it this way in school.      man that bugs me whe  people will say pooted instread of fart.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Behind, bottom. etc    I don't think its a dirty word, but you never know who will be offended at any moment. I personally think they are over reacting.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Bum, bottom, tushy.  Who knows why people get their knickers in a twist over things.  Little kids say all kinds of things, like my daughter screaming, "where's my penis?" at church.      However, philosophically, when did "butt" become a dirty word?  When poop first came out of it, would be my guess.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Well, "butt" is hardly a correct term - it's crude slang at best. What's wrong with "bottom"?|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	Seems anymore people are just looking for a reason to be offended, well  if my child saying BUTT does it, they can prepare to be offended, ive stopped trying, i never thought id livein  a time when the words" merry christmas" were offensive, go figure....well you know what...all of them can have a merry christmas or kiss my BUTT   lol.    there isnt a thing wrong with the term BUTT,  they have to have something to call it when referring to it, people just need to get over themselves and stay out of other peoples  business is all i can say.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	Who knows.    Everyone gets offended at the dumbest of things.  There are people out there who get offended when children call their body parts by their body parts (ex: a girl calling her vagina a vagina, and a boy calling his penis a penis.)  It is not socially acceptable apparently.  I think they'd rather he call it his behind.    I'd rather they call it exactly what it is.  Sorry, what's the problem with teaching your children again?    edit: I know of a couple who taught their daughter to say kitty to refer to her vagina.  I'm sorry, but that is much more offensive than the word vagina to me.  I don't think people should use pet names for body parts.  And why should we have pet names only for the genitals and butt?  No one calls their arm a warmy, no one calls their leg a leggy.  The only other exception is feetsies and toesies, but hey, that's cute =]    Also, to the below poster, how is saying "I have to go poop" worse than saying "I have to go potty?"  Ugh.  People just need to grow thicker skin and stop getting all offended over everything that reaches their childs ears that might not be so sugar-coated.|`|n3IoftMFaa	I know, it is weird - my son, who was 3 said "I have to go poop" at school and he was told "not to say potty words". I was like - my Good God - if you have to poop - say it!|`|184e8896989175431da150acffb20cd8aa	My kids called it their bottom when they were little. Around 3rd grade it became butt.|`|by7H31Djaa	Are you serious! Im laughing my BUTT off! Lol I don't see anything at all wrong with that word. It's either fanny, tushy, or butt. I go with butt and if no one likes it they can kiss my butt! Lol Im just messing around it just surprises me that people would actually get offended by a 3 year old using the word butt!    EDIT: Bottom and behind....i forgot about those. But i have heard lots of little kids saying butt and i think it's cute. Since it was unexpected it is a little alarming but cute...come they're kids.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	I am not saying this to be rude, but just to throw another opinion out there. I think it is very crass when a child uses words like "butt", "crap" or even shut up that have become an accepted within society. Its not that they are "dirty" words, rather they are not age appropriate. In this crazy world, my job is to keep my kids innocent as long as possible so they can be a kid, and I really think that is through the details in life. My daughter says bottom, and I do not feel that we are tramatizing her.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	If someone has a problem with butt, they must have a problem with buttock. And since buttocks, is the correct term, they must have a problem with proper english.|`|GU3RauKOaa	Well that's stupid considering butt is short for buttocks which is a real term. Its not like a bad word, its just shortening buttocks. Would they be offended if he said "mommy, i fell and hurt my left buttock?"    I would just tell the ppl who are offended that butt is short for buttock, look in a medical encyclopedia.    My 16 month old says booty, lol...

wENdWT5kaa	LOL at your add on. :)     No need to worry, calm down mommy. :)     My daughter once had a fever of 103. I freaked out, brought her to the ER, all they did was look at her and gave her motrin. Even tho i had been giving her tylonal all day, it really didn't work.  But after the motrin, she was fine the next day.     Try giving your daughter Motrin as well. Also, give her a cool (luke warm) bath and see if that helps. I always gave my daughter a cool bath before giving her tylonal. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.     Give her lots of fluids as well, it's important to keep her hydrated.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	with a fever I'd say to call the doctor. I am having the same problem here...just no fever|`|NXwzuv3Paa	yes. it happens to me alot. i give motrin now for a fever istead of tylenol. it works faster and gets the fever down and keeps it down for at least 5 hours.|`|olQiqlSuaa	I have run into the same issue with 2 of my 3 boys.  Also took them to the Emergency Room once they hit the magic 103 mark.  They gave them Motrin (Ibuprofen) and the fever came down nicely.      Tylenol (acetamidophen) is also good, and the only thing recommended by our pediatricians for an infant under 6 months, but those same pediatricians say that the Motrin (ibuprofen) works faster and better for infants 6 months and older.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	Aww, you're not a freak -- they asked if you wanted to post in that section probably because you used the words worry-wort =)    How old is your baby?  Under 3 months, that temp. is a big deal and she should be taken to the doctor right away!    If my baby's temp. did this, I would carefully monitor him (make sure he was drinking enough) for the next day or so.  If this keeps up, and you can't get her temp back down, then I would call the doctor.    Do you know the source for the fever?  Has she got an ear infection?  RSV? Sinus infection?  If you can't tell what would be causing the fever, then I would call the doctor.    Hope your baby feels better soon!
pYn2L2DHaa	It's possible, but it's going to require WAY more than $3000 to live in New York for a year and pay tuition because you will be considered an out of state resident (you should check with the New York Public School system about this, first).  You'll also have rent, food, utility and transportation expenses to pay.     One thing -- see if you can get some grants to help you with school, tuition and perhaps and internship with a designer.    It takes some work to apply for grants, but it can be well worth the effort:  I did a career change into meteorology in middle age by using grants after being told I was completely ineligible for financial aid because of my age and because I'd already been in school.|`|vO4uvoYBaa	all i can say is good luck cuz you gonna need it, i truly believe youre not gonna make it on ya own with 3 grand saved up, you need to suck it up stay at home finish ya senior year then roll out, it would be better if you ask me, cuz that's what i did but i left at 16|`|PLbmKNpvaa	It can be done. I moved out of home at 16 and ended up going back to school to finish when I was 17. I didn't have financial support from my parents and it was a tough slog but I did it.   You have to have it really well planned out, and don't be suprised if you find it hard to get housing etc. because of your age.|`|ddP3klT3aa	NY is very expensive. It has the highest state taxes. $3000 is nothing for that place. If I were you I would just suck it up until you graduate. If you move, NY may have different regulations then your school. You may have to take more classes (some schools require 5 english classes, some 4). It may take you longer to graduate if you move. Also, if I were you, major in two things. Fashion design is not a promising career.|`|wC1ValUzaa	by the way you looked at it, it seems very impossible.  But by sheer determination you can make it.  Just stay focused on whatever you plan to do and plan things very well.|`|4f53edbce16f4673f58a9dcccc9dfddfaa	It's definitely possible.  I had a friend in high school who lived alone (who was actually a grade younger, but I do know she was living alone still her senior year).  She actually seemed to get by pretty well.  She had a job, which was apparently enough to live on and she had her own apartment.  She didn't have a car though, so going from her apartment (which was near downtown in a mid-sized city) to the high school her and I went to (which was on the east side of town, so a decent distance) she had to take the bus.  But beyond that, I know she seemed pretty capable of taking care of herself and she wasn't even 18 yet back when I was going to school with her.  Although the only thing with your plan is $3,000 doesn't sound like much to live on in New York and probably wouldn't last long there at all.|`|fiZaeUwHaa	there is a LOT to really think about when it comes to that decision. I did it, but I am not like other people - I had a friend move in with me who made 1300 a month.    there are things to think about that you never had to before:    Rent/Damage Deposit - when you get a place you will need to pay the equilivant of 2 months rent, and sometimes a damage deposit on top of that. Example - 600 a month = 1500 First payment before moving in!!  Dont forget references - you might need them!!    Food - you will have to go back to BASICS - I mean Ketchup, salt, pepper - EVERYTHING. It costs about 800 for your first grocery bill to get all you will need.    Items - Plungers, shower curtains, air spray, dish towels, dish cloths - it is all needed - even if you dont think of it!    Bills - TV, Power, Hydro Bills (since you want to move into a bigger town/city, you will need to pay municipal hydro) internet, etc....    Lets not forget gas, bus money, extra money, emergency funds etc....    It cost me and my Fiance almost 10,000 when we first moved in together to get all set up and things rolling.    And thats just the money issues - What about if you can HANDLE the extra freedom. You will be able to stay up late with no rules - but will that effect your schooling, grades, personality. Will you end up messing up your chances to go to a good college or university, will your friends dislike the more independant you?    Then think of your family - will you be putting a strain on your relationship with them? Not just your parents - all teens think they are suffering "emotional abuse" at home - fact is, your just trying to be independant, and your being a snot, and you dont like what they are saying, so you automaticaly think its abuse. Will you lose your family with this decision. You may think it is what you want to do, but sometimes, you need family more than you need friends, and you will learn the hard way when it comes down to it.    You need to REALLY look at all the things that moving out at a young age brings. In your views, your friends views, your families views and society. Some people will not rent a place to someone who is so young and going to school - there is a risk involved!    I dont mean to sound like a snob - but i moved out at 18, with cops involved because i seriously DID have an abusive home life, and even with a solid pay comming in, I found it hard. If it werent for the scholarships, I would have NEVER been able to go to college.
kprKXEOSaa	With my first child, I always struggled to have enough breast milk.  I think it was a combination of him being born early and was never able to latch on very well, and that I wasn't drinking enough water and eating enough.  If you're dieting trying to lose weight, the first thing to go is milk production.  You can't explain to your body, this 1000 calories is for me, that 300 calories is for the baby.  With my second, I had plenty of milk and she shot from the 50th percentile at birth to the 95th percentile, within a month or two.  She was a full-term baby and never had the latch-on problems my son did, and I was drinking lots of water and eating much better that time.    I was following the advice of this book, which I highly recommend, "Lean & Free 2000 Plus" by Dana Thornock.  It's available on amazon.com, used, for under $5.  I also lost weight much more easily the second time, which wouldn't make sense to most people because I was eating a lot more while breastfeeding my second baby.    As far as supplements, I've used fenugreek and blessed thistle herbal supplements, and there are many others that can help with milk supply.  The fenugreek makes your urine and sweat smell like maple syrup, but it works.    Good luck!    Another thing I wished I had known about with my first baby, is a supplemental feeder.  Medela makes the one I've used.  It's basically a little container that holds some formula, with a teeny tube that you tape to your skin so the end of the tube comes out even with your nipple.  The baby gets formula and breastmilk at the same time, and it's great because you know your baby is getting enough to eat, and you're stimulating milk production through nursing at the same time.  I used one for a couple days with my second child, until my milk came in.  With my first child, my milk didn't come in for 5 days, if I had had one, it would have really helped!|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	What makes you think you didn't produce ANY?  Because your newborns seemed to want to nurse round the clock?  Because you tried to pump and couldn't get any?  Because what you noticed was colostrom and gave up nursing before mature milk was produced?    This time around you need to educate yourself more on how breastfeeding works, attend some la leche league meetings, and see a good ibclc.    http://www.llli.org.|`|12Aifvf4aa	It is a complete myth that all mums can breastfeed, some of us have problems and the milk just doesn't come down. Getting rest can help a bit    I used a breast pump for a while once I had the babies and it helped for a while. In the end I put the baby on a bottle  If you can give the babe the colostrum you produce at the beginning you will be really helping to boost their immune systems.|`|1IDSGM71aa	This situation hasn't happened to me personally, but it has to a close friend. She has two children and couldn't produce milk with either of them. She had really wanted to, but her milk never came in at all and after trying to breast feed, she switched to formula so her daughters wouldn't starve. If you aren't already a member, you might want to join www.cafemom.com because they have a lot of different groups and people who have experienced all sorts of things. Someone there might be able to offer you advice, too. Good luck honey!|`|8uiH6iRbaa	i am really sorry to hear that you have this problem i have no idea what the problem is or what to do !    just try a breast pump now to maybe encourage it x x x     it must be really frustrating for you hope all works out|`|WmXOfXqhaa	I did not have an issue with not producing any at all, but I did have issues with a low supply.  My son's pediatrician suggested taking Fenugreek or Mother's Milk Tea.  Both can be purchased online or in health stores.  I'm not sure if it's safe to take either of these while you're pregnant, so please check with your doctor first.    Best of luck to you!  I think it's an amazing bonding experience with your baby, so I hope you're able to enjoy it.    **EDIT**Another thing I meant to mention is that everyone will have opinions on the best way to do things and whether or not you should continue trying to breast feed.  I had two lactation consultants in the hospital and three nurses all tell me something different!  It was very hard to relax like they were suggesting when I had so many different opinions coming at me.  Just trust your instinct and know that YOU know what's best for you and your baby.|`|yQkpiCvWaa	hi i have 2 daughters one 4 and one 6 months. i wanted to breast feed them, i produced milk with both but neither of them would drink it so both bottle fed, i dont know of anything to help you but your not a freak. good luck|`|FegAXbgiaa	Hi    I can empathise i so wanted to breastfeed all my children but didnt produce any milk apart from a few drops,with my first child i tried and my midwife told me to supplement the feeds with a bottle, after she lost so much weight i bottle fed exclusively.     So no you are not a freak, unfortunately i wasnt advised of any supplements, maybe your doctor will do better than mine.    Good luck.
SDjrojZXaa	oh i can soooo relate to what you are going through...i am lucky i have carpet but i think i would take some steps towards babyproofing like corner protectors and the room you are in the most use a gate at the door and put those foam colored jigsaw puzzle looking mats on the floor. I have done things like made a shelf on the entertainment center with things he can play with. i cleared my coffee table and put puffies and snacks on it. The pillow in front of the computer hard drive USED to work now im trying to get inventive so we put a big toy in fron of it so he gets distracted and forgets about what is behind the toy...it works about half the time lol.I wish you all the luck what i have found is a lot of trial and error if he goes to something you know that is a problem to address but my son had had his share of falling accidents already but he is learning now and so am i.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Iron and stone?   Yech.   Most babies I know, except the totally willing to sit without movement, expect to be out and about exploring their world - there are fenced in type things that you can purchase from One Step Ahead (a catalog that also has an online store) to section off part of your home, the link for what I am thinking of is below.   Honestly, the best thing to do while baby proofing is crawl around at baby eye height and look at what she can get into.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	She's a baby.  She's going to fall down and she's going to bump her head a little along the way.  It's not going to hurt that badly and it's not going to traumatize her for life.  If she falls down, cheer and say "You're okay, get back up and play!"    She'll only react if you react badly.    eta: then maybe that was something you should've mentioned in your original question.  can you purchase some cheap memory foam, or foam pieces to cover most of the furniture?  tape them to everything if you have to.    is there not a room in the entire house where she can play without worrying about hitting her head?|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	when Jacob starts to crawl I am going to let him have full use of the hall by closing the doors and using a gate in the doorway.

YqoxcTN9aa	the teacher shouldnt have needed to be reminded, she is a teacher not a 2 year old, make sure to call weekly to remind from now on maybe then she will get her act together, i am happy the landlord was there for your grandson & a, sorry   that your grandson had to experience that|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Mistakes do happen. They shouldn't, but they do. Why didn't the child know he goes to the club that day, and not on the bus? Surely all he had to do was remind the teacher about it, if it's been the same arrangement every week? If he's always picked up at school at the moment, even a five year old should know to say "but I don't go on the bus!"    In any case the little boy needs an emergency plan. Teachers aren't the only ones who make mistakes. What if the person who was to meet him at the bus stop fell and broke something, or was stuck in traffic? Any child who is getting off a bus to be met needs to know exactly what they should do if something goes wrong and the person who is meeting them is not there.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I would be very upset at the situation, however, you didn't tell us if the mother sent a note to school explaining the dismissal procedure or not. At my son's school, if the dismissal plan changes, we are required to send a note w/a detailed explanation of the change and what it will entail. Your grandson should not have been held accountable (even an older child shouldn't as kids rely on routine). If your daughter did let the school know of the change in plan, then they should be held accountable, otherwise your daughter is the one at fault.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Awww, poor little guy!    Geez, with all the kids she forgot, maybe they could all get together in a huddle and keep warm! Good Lord. I would think one time, okay - you forgot. But she did that with three other students? Time to pull her head out of her butt. I would not tolerate any crap that makes you feel like it's yours or his fault for this. Perhaps she needs to make a note to herself as well? If "he" couldn't be responsible? My God, he's five years old! Perhaps the principal needs to remember what planet most five year olds are on half the time - and even if they know they're supposed to be somewhere, they can often get confused and listen to another adult who redirects them. Been there, done that at that age!     How sad. You and your daughter need to talk to the other parents and see what they think and then go to the prinicipal with your concerns. This is unacceptable!    ETA: At five years old, this kid should not be the one to remind the teacher. That's her job - she is the responsible ADULT in charge here. And she did not accept responsibility or her "mistake" and instead blamed the kid! How is that accepting that you 'made a mistake'?     The bus driver also should not have let the kid off unless a parent was there ... our school district will not let little kids off the bus unless a recognized parent is there - otherwise they go back to the bus garage with the driver.|`|gyzMxjAiaa	Mistakes happen, but the way the school is handling this is unacceptable. I'd go to the Superintendent and, if necessary, the school board until someone assures that there will be a plan in place to make sure this doesn't happen again.|`|5D0KuT74aa	20 degrees  yeah, thats really cold  you've never been to siberia, in -70 weather, then you wouldn't complain about 20  i would've done nothing  stay out of it|`|AA10620596	I have been working and volunteering in elementary schools for about 3 years now, and I have to let you know, it is nothing like when we were in school. They do expect these little bitty kids to remember all kinds of things, and this is regardless of the fact that more families are headed by single parents or two parents working. So although when we were kids, if we were supposed to stay after school for something, if we forgot or messed up, the odds were that someone would be there to help us out regardless. But in todays society, we need to be holding teachers and schools more responsible NOT LESS!     I am working on getting my own teaching degree, and even though I know that kids need to be taught responsibility for their own actions, but not when it might put them in danger! I plan on making students responsible for remembering to bring their homework, or get a note signed or something like that, but not where they are supposed to go after school. That is what I will be getting paid to do!     Let us know what happens with the teacher and the school, please. I hope your grandson is doing well (thank goodness kids are so resilient!).|`|ddP3klT3aa	You and your daughter need to go to the school. I think you can actually sue for that.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	I would just keep contacting the school.  I understand your frustration, but getting this angry isn't going to solve anything.  If you call the school, don't threaten, don't be angry, don't yell.  It will not make your case any better.    eta: I understand your fury for the teacher, but there is a possibility that it WAS a mistake.  Whether or not she's accepting responsibility for it is what's key here.  You need to talk to HER, and explain that it was completely unacceptable for her to send him home without notice of what days he's supposed to be in the club.  Explain to her what happened and that you'd like for it to not happen again.    Humans are not perfect, by any means, and I'm sure she did not mean to endanger your grandchild.  She probably thought there was someone waiting for him at the end of the road.  Honestly, the bus driver shouldn't have let the kid off the bus without there being an adult there, but that's a completely different suck.    Just keep your cool and continue to contact the school.  If the school refuses to accept responsibility for it, then maybe move your grandson to a different school? (if at all possible)|`|AA11206135	Call the local news and have them do a story on it.... Schools hate it when they are made to look bad, but it does get them to straighten up their acts.|`|l6QPKcoLaa	My brother was stuck in a school bus when he was 5 years old and it was 97 degrees outside and all the windows in the bus was closed shut. Luckily he knew hot to get out of the school bus and was walking in the middle of nowhere. Mind you my brother is anemic and is diagnosed with aspergers syndrome. If it wasnt that my fathers best friend wasnt working with the transportation my brother probably wouldve been kidnapped or dead and the transportation company was 45 minutes away from our house. Well basically my parents didnt do anything they were just happy that he was fine and safe at home but I think you should go to the superintendent and tell them the situation with your grandson. Bring the apartment manager too as the witness and the babysitter and make sure those people that gave you that problem gets what they deserve. I mean come on how retarded can you be to say that it was a 5year old kids fault? They are lucky your grandson didnt cross the street, what if he did? is that his fault too? please give them hell is what I would do. Yeah they need the job for their kids (if she has sounds like she dont) but at least take her out of the program and have somebody else there who actually loves kids or change him to another school. Im pissed just reading what happen I hope everything comes out good for you guys and take care|`|AA12145826	I feel so bad for your daughter & grandson. I totally understand your frustration. And it seems a lot of people here are saying "well why didn't he remind the teacher that he had club after school?" Hello people, do you not remember being that age? If he did remember, do you really think he's going to contradict the teacher? What she says goes, right? At least that's what I remember.    I would definitely have your daughter go back and speak with both the principal and teacher. Explain that the situation was unacceptable and that she does not appreciate the "brush off" attitude she was given. He's a CHILD and he could have been hurt or worse. She deserves a very heartfelt apology at the very least that's for sure. In the mean time, for everyone's sake, I'd have your daughter sit down tonight and print of a couple sheets of quick notes saying something to the effect of "REMINDER: Today, Wednesday, ___[insert date here]___, Billy will be attending the Happy Day Club after school. His babysitter will be picking him up after wards, please DO NOT send him on his regular bus. Please call me if you have any questions. Thank you, Billy's Mom" Have her cut them out and place the stack near where she will remember to put them in his book bag every Wednesday to *remind* the teacher since she has just proven she's prone to "forgetting". This is what we have to do for my daughter. Every Monday she rides the bus to her babysitter's house (every other day she'll go home where Grandma is waiting for her) and even though when we signed her up to ride the bus, we put down that she will ride a different bus on Mondays, we still put that little reminder note in her book bag. Better to be safe then sorry. This way, there is no question that we did EVERYTHING we could, short of putting her on the right bus ourselves, to make sure she gets where she needs to go.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Forget the school, contact the district office and if you get nowhere with them contact the superintendent of schools.  It's absolutely unconscionable that this teacher and principal would blame a helpless 5 year old for their incompetance!!! Doesn't anyone take responsibility for their actions anymore?!!!!  I am digusted for you and I think your daughter needs to escalate this to the highest level!!!  What if that apt manager hadn't been paying attention and, not to scare you, but Joe Q. Child Molester pulled up and offered your grandson a warm car to sit it?  This is 2009 not 1959, the adminstration of that school needs to be held accountable.

Good luck to ya|`|bc50adcd7a4cda84a5f4451579fa7554aa	see i would own this school by the time i got finished with them. i have called the cops on a school before and i would again. i have fought teachers, BOE, and everyone in between. my kid wouldn't have gone through that and me not do something. i would've been up there the second they called me. what they did could have gotten that baby kidnapped or killed and that scares me. that teacher should NOT be working there. how dare she blame it on him, heck she did this to other kids too. it is her that needs to know what programs he is in especially when paper work or verbal permission has already been established with the school. i would get off the computer or take the day off work and go directly to the BOE. bypass the principal because he is obviously an idiot and talk to someone there, if they won't do anything go above them, everyone has a boss. the only way to change anything in the school system is to fight it. you can do it in a mature way i promise (it's hard though). i have managed to have a child removed from a school for being a bully to my daughter, i have also helped get a bus driver fired, changed the way the bus system runs out here, and where the kids stand for that bus. seems small but it has helped a lot of other children.|`|r9gBoBLCaa	I would complain to the department of education. The teacher has no right to be putting kids on buses. "Oh your moms not here, well, On the bus you go!" Is not the way you do it. You call her. The guy who luckily helped your grandson was safe. What if he wasn't? It could have easily been someone to steal the poor thing.   I understand the teacher forgetting they have the happy club, thats an honest mistake. It's the throwing them onto the bus that I don't understand.  So, I think your daughter should complain to the department of education or social services or whatver she can. This is not right. This could have easily ended tragically.    xxxx|`|v070sAApaa	i know exactly how u feel i am 17 and yes i know to young to be a mother but anyway i have a 4 year daughter who was just starting school. and i told my husband to go pick her and when he got there they said they put her on that bus well he called me and said they put her on the bus he was furious and so was i i could not believe they would do that just because her dad was bout 5 min late . so i took off early and found her sitting in front of the curled up.IT WAS LIKE 20 DEGREES!!!!!! I WAS HORRIFIED !!!!! the next day we pulled her out of that school and put her in another and my husband really let that teacher have it|`|irLnPW4aaa	Wow.  I dont' blame you for being upset. I would have been livid.  I might have even contacted the local news about this (outside in that cold weather is DANGEROUS).    Firstly I would call the BUS COMPANY because in my area, the bus driver is not allowed to leave children that age at the bus stop unless there is someone at the bus stop to pick them up (the bus driver would be reprimanded for this for sure!).    Secondly, I would call the school principal and complain.  However, was it normal for your son to attend this program on that day of the week??? If it was normal, the teacher should have known and been responsible for making sure your son went to the right place at the end of the day.  IF it was NOT his normal thing to go to that program on that day of the week, then you should have sent a writtten note into school that morning to notify the teacher so that she would know and take responsibility for making sure he got to the right place,,,,thats IS part of the teachers job, but in a case where it was something out of the ordinary (if it was) she should have had it in writing from you.    Third, I would buy a nice little thank you gift for the apartment manager.
h6ZSneA7aa	I have also been having dreams that I am pregnant. I don't know your situation...But I think I am having dreams like that, because I long for a baby... I lost my last child at 35 weeks and 6 days preg. Maybe I'm off base with you....But maybe that's your reasoning too??|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	Because in your subconscious, you probably want to be pregnant.|`|tP4Bx4OWaa	why do i keep dreaming am rich? lol ask in dream analysis section but its just a  dream, enjoy it, least you can 'hand it back' when you wake up :-)|`|OMOuxROoaa	To dream that you are pregnant, symbolizes an aspect of yourself or some aspect of your personal life that is growing and developing. You may not be ready to talk about it or act on it.  This may also represent the birth of a new idea, direction, project or goal.    To dream that you are pregnant with the baby dying inside of you, suggests that a project you had put a lot of effort into is falling apart and slowly deteriorating. Nothing is working out the way you want it to.     If you are really pregnant and having this dream, then it represents your anxieties about the pregnancy.  Women in the first  trimester of their pregnancy tend to dream of tiny creatures, fuzzy animals, flowers, fruit and water. In the second trimester, dreams will reflect your anxieties about being a good mother and concerns about possible complications with the birth. Dreams of giving birth to a non-human baby are also common during this period of the pregnancy. Finally, in the third trimester, dreams consists of your own mother. As your body changes and grows, dreams of whales, elephants and dinosaurs and other larger animals may also start appearing at this stage.|`|Y0vkS6bKaa	Cause you want a baby and to look at it's adorable face!|`|Tn0EBBCZaa	Dreams are windows into your soul.. maybe there is something you have been longing for and you are just unaware of it at this moment. Maybe your body is preparing its self for the future through dreams|`|AsICkz9naa	Because subconsciously I think that maybe you want to have a baby. That kept happening to me and yes I want to have a baby.
9e93f5c1efa5df7e8ecf9b696a8a121caa	I don't if it's true or not.The elders have seen there children grow and made mistakes,they have gone through much in life and now they are intelligent to accept life as it is.But parents are new to their roles and sometimes they expect too much from their kids,they expect them to achieve more than them and they focus only for the betterment of their lives so they are strict to their kids and so they are a little distant from their kids.|`|fGgGqYJMaa	i wouldnt say ther emotionally closer but the may see eye to eye on a lot more things|`|YqoxcTN9aa	i have never heard that, i dont think that genes have anything to do with how emotional we are with someone, i think grandparents sometimes are able to give more quality time & may be more attentive because they dont have as much going on as the childs parents, & have learned from how they were with their own children..|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Uh...you know how genes are passed on, right? So think about it. Of course they don't have more common genes - that's complete nonsense.|`|UkRjx6wNaa	Not at all. Your parents each passed on half of their genes to you, and you passed half of yours to your child. Therefore, the kid only has about one fourth of his genes in common with either grandparent. However, if you inherited a gene for a recessive trait and the child's other parent did as well, it may appear in the child whereas it didn't in either of his parents.    Also, grandparents feel less guilty about spoiling their grandchildren than parents do, so that helps a bit with bonding. :]
swL7bQfAaa	You can't. You can get sole custody with joint guardianship - which means that you have care and control of your son and his everyday life, but any major life decisions must be made in conjunction with his father.  I doubt you will find a court to completely deny a father his rights to a child. You will have to make some kind of concession and this is probably the best as it gives you the most control and is basically what you have now.(Only it will be formalized in Court)|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	You need to speak to a lawyer. If you have one contact one if not ring legal aid!!

ooadGX6Laa	Hi Hun, I am really sorry to hear whats happened and that your boyfriend wont be there for rest of the pregnancy.  This might sound very silly, but why dont you consider starting a diary? Write about everything to do with your pregnancy, how your feeling, how your body is changing, what happens when you go to midwifes, just basically anything you want to get off your chest? That way, although your boyfriend wont be able to share it with you, if you write is all down, at least you have something to show him when he gets out.  I mean I dont know what kind of guy he is, he might not actually want to sit and read a diary, but at least it will give you something to do, and something to look back on as the weeks and months go on, as your not going to be able to remember everything that happens throughout your pregnancy. I have  been on maternity leave since 32 weeks due to having loads of holidays to take, and I am bored stuck at home alot, so I started a bit of a diary, mostly its just rambelling rubbish, but it keeps me occupied, and I sometimes look back to when I started it and think ' Oh yeah I forgot about that.'   Just a thought.    Make sure you get lots of suppoort and help from your family and friends, it will make you feel better to know you have people there for you, and although it wont be the person you want most, its better then facing this alone.     You have to stay strong and be positive!!    P,s, remember to take lots of pictures of your bump as it develops over next few months so you can show your boyfriend when he gets out.    Hope everything works out well for you and feel free to E-Mail if you just need someone to talk to.    All the best. xx|`|I4oSggsJaa	I think maybe I know you,   anyways,   did he go to prison like state or federal  or was it local    well if he went to prison he has to go to nyc to get processed and get his   im sorry to say this but it could be a couple of days before you here from him     stay strong for him and the baby  and try to be patient with him please cause hes not going through the greatest time either trust me     good luck|`|aW8VZGDcaa	You will have to stay strong for your baby. Find a good birthing partner who you know will support you (even with my partner at my sons birth, all I wanted was my mum) Keep your head up, this is for a short period of your families life, focus on the positives and look forward to the future. I wish you all the best x|`|f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	Thankfully his sentence isn't very long. I know it seems like forever.  However it really isn't.  I've known people who have spent 15+ yrs in prison and have never known their children.  He made mistakes and is working on getting his life together, its wonderful that you two will have this as an example for your child.  Sadly when we are young, we do things in the heat of the moment, never fully understanding the impact that moment can have on our lives. Go visit him as often as possible. Get things ready for the baby, take lots of pictures for daddy.  He will be home before you know it. Best of luck to all 3 of you!|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Relax... Don't get stressed as stress could affect the birth of hte baby and can cause birth defects.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	HE may miss the whole pregnancy and even the birth but he will be out at just the right time...you never know it could even be less than 7 and a half months..I suggest you start a scrapbook fo your pregnancy...it will keep you busy and give him something wonderful to look at when he gets out...buy a big hardbacked book with plain pages and stick in phots of your tummy...take one every week and do a page for each week...so on some pages you can write down what the doc said and put pic of tummy in...other pages will have scan pictures and maybe pics of you as you go out to get baby clothes...oh I am so sad for you...but please try to enjoy the pregnancy anyway...phone him often and write EVERY day...men in prison feel very lonely and photos and pictures make them feel very special...in fact they get sdtatus form it..if you have a lot of letters and pics then the other men respect them as someone who is loved and missed....he could be in a whole lot longer and he would miss out on so much more...he will be out for the MOST important bit....good luck.|`|0GDgg2zsaa	just go to the jail. k? K.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	Making a mistake is forgetting to pay a bill or something like that. Getting into a gang fight and, no doubt, hurting others is a serious crime. There is a vast difference between the two.    I hope your boyfriend will realise the gravity of what he has done and that he will grow up while in prison. I hope that, upon release, he will be a much better person and that he will show some respect for others in the future. Good luck with your baby.|`|pRoyFWL6aa	Although it may come across as harsh i don't want to upset you .Firstly to receive 15 months suggests that there was a lot more to the offence than you are  saying or your partner had some previous.I wonder if any victims of his crime are still suffering from his offence a couple of years since or are scarred physically/mentally for life.The justice system in this country leaves a lot to be desired and with all the support afforded to the offenders as opposed to the victims it takes something of a serious nature to be jailed for 15 months.Would you want serious offenders to be spared jail for reasons such as yours.I cannot understand why with a possibility of prison hanging over your partner you decided to start a family.The facts of life are devastating at times ,but without law and order nobody would survive.Lets hope on his release your lives as a family are happy ones.|`|0WYzUsjMaa	i feel so sorry for wats just happened to you, with the really important things to do with the baby, eg. 20 week scan and the birth, have say your mother or a nurse (whoever you will feel more at ease with) video tape the 20 week scan and birth so that way it will be the next best thing than being there and he will get to see it when he comes out|`|cYFblmpVaa	yes stress and worry affects your child|`|N1IqgXfvaa	It's a terrible situation but you just have to get on with it. Take photos and send them in to make sure he is as involved as possibly can be, keep going to see him. Maybe request to the prison that he can be there for the birth? You can go and see him soon after the birth. The way the prison system is now he will prob be out by then anyway, just tell him to be a good boy inside and behave.|`|BrjyljGIaa	"Please don't leave horrible comments"?  What sort of comments do you expect?  Your baby's father is a convicted felon.  He will be in jail when your baby is born.  The odds are not good for such a child.  Good luck.|`|qjDxKXENaa	im sorry to hear this... boys at that ae does do silly things and grow up later. the only thing i can advice you is to stay calm, you dont do good if you cry, stress and worry. why dont you go and visit him? ask him to ask the responsible person there if they allow him to come to the scan with you that day? also if he is not out by the time baby comes, he could try and ask again to be with you at the labour. they do allow that sort of thing under supervision, well depending on what he has actually done!! if killing someone is not involved..|`|ksqIYFQUaa	I think you should've waited to have a child when this was all over. It was always a chance he'd go to prison so it would've been best for you all if you had waited to here what was going to happen. Stress & worry does have an affect on your child especially during the birth so you'll just have to keep thinking that at least he will be there for you when he gets out. Only you will remember he wasn't there at the birth, the baby won't. I know it will be tough but you have friends and family around you to help until he is home.     You can both learn from this. Never get involved in gangs and violence, it's not cool and it's not clever. Think how you would feel it was your child involved or being attacked, you'd want justice for them. You need to both grow up now and take responsibility for your child and give them a good life.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	It sucks that you and your baby have to suffer for what your boyfriend did years ago, but you had to have known it was a possibility. It also sucks that he will miss some things that are obviously very important to you.     However on the bright side, if he really has changed and grown up, which for your sake I hope that he has, it's just a few months some people go an entire lifetime without knowing their children, some people go years, for all different sorts of reasons.     Just be thankful that, soon enough, this whole ordeal will be over, and the three of you can go on with your lives. Be thankful that your child won't remember.     Just be strong, and remember, it's only temporary, and you can always visit, or write. You and your baby will be fine.|`|hX7zhyIoaa	just try to relax and visit him at every opurtunity that you get also take photos and send them in all the time if you get in touch with the prison and request that he could be there at the birth then maybe they would allow that i really hope this all works out well for you and your baby also the BF.. prisons these days he will probs be out in time.. just dont stress xxx|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	A friends husband was recently jailed for perjury, and like you she's scared and worried about going through a pregnancy without him. All you can do is the same as she's doing. Focus on staying strong for your baby - because stress does have an effect on the pregnancy - and for your jailed boyfriend. Keep him up to date with tons of pictures, of you, weekly pics of your bump, and scan pictures of unborn bubs to keep him included even though he can't be there in person. Write him endless letters, perhaps start a scrap book or a journal especially for him when he gets released. Speak to him on the phone often, visit him on visiting day. Tell him to keep his head up and focus on being on his best behaviour so he gets that good behaviour early release, and see about speaking to a solicitor, and seeing if it's possible for his sentence to be reduced, or him tagged earlier. If not see if it's possible for him to be allowed to scan visits, and to be there at the baby's birth. I know little about law, but i do know that sometimes a person's good behaviour since the crime can have an affect on the sentence they get. It sounds like your boyfriend just got unlucky and had a harsh judge, who didn't take into account his life now. Keep your head up though. You've only got 5 and a half months minimum, many women are separated from their partners for years. You will get through. Just focus on staying strong and getting through it. It will pass quicker than you realise if you stop counting the days.|`|sJQ6gG0Uaa	hah hes not such a hard gangster now!|`|04dd91a481260888cf4efe0e2fafa0d9aa	A very good friend of mine went through this same thing a year ago.  She was pregnant and her husband was locked up for breaking parole by leaving the state to help her move her stuff up.  She was very strong and I was so proud of her she went to visit him whenever possible and had a BEAUTIFUL baby girl who he met 4 months after he got out of prison.  They're very happy now and he's turned his life around for his family.     You can do this... be strong for your baby... It's going to be ok.  :-)|`|ZcmiQU3Eaa	I am very sorry about your problems. You should be relaxed because the baby feels if you are nervous or stresses. It would be very hard for you to go through this birth by yourself but you could ask somebody to take some pictures and record the important moment on a camera. This way you will be able to show to your boyfriend everything. I wish you all the good things in the world and take care of you and your baby and i am very sure that everything will be ok.

wiAVa1H5aa	1)   If you can stand it, yes - while this is a classic case of nipple confusion and now the infant excepts a bottle and not you, any milk you can offer is good for the baby.   If the infant is swallowing (you should be able to hear it or see the baby swallow), it's getting milk.    2)  You have a point, if you can't stand it anymore then you need to do what keeps you sane and a happy mom, Mom being happy is important to an infant's development, perhaps more so then breastmilk.    ) I have not, I did however have one infant who needed a nipple shield throughout his nursing due to oral insensitivity on his part, which was frustrating mostly because the dog LOVED them and they were easy to drop.   I also had an infant who had to be supplemented his 1st 2 weeks of life since he was so large, that was frustrating - but with nursing as much as possible and pumping in-between, and fenugreek caplets (2 caplets, 3 times a day, it's a flavor for artificial maple syrup and can lower blood pressure too but it helps me).    You need to be able to get through this and still remain sane and love your child, if breastfeeding is a barrier then it's okay to go to formula.   Next time try not to ever use a bottle, other folks can - just not you.   Good luck, and I am so sorry this has been so hard!|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	It might just be confusion because she is used to the bottle. I would find a lactating consultant in your area and figure out the best way to nip it in the butt.    Don't give up, if you want to breast feed then breast feed. However if you don't, there's no harm in bottle feeding, especially if your still giving breast milk. And if you don't end up doing that either, don't let anyone tell you you're wrong, do what ever works for you and your family.|`|hieQHR0daa	Big decisions needed.  You could offer half the formula you've been giving then offer breast and if baby still doesn't get it you can give the rest of the bottle.  At 5 months you could be breast feeding for a further 5 months or less, if you were successful and if you wanted to continue.  It is much more difficult to keep a milk supply going by expressing. The decision is yours but you need to decide if it is worth continuing to try or if you would be better off giving yourself and baby a break, and sticking with formula. Try breast feeding next baby and it may well go a lot easier.  Don't feel guilty about it either way you are doing your best and baby is fed, cared for and loved.|`|Tn0EBBCZaa	If you want to breastfeed that just feed the baby that way, I believe that the baby is getting confused jumping back and forth. Dont put your self through pain if the baby isnt interested in feeding. You can always pump and put it into bottles and that way you know the baby is still getting all the nutrients that you want it to get. Dont make this a big deal... the baby is not going to remember it anyways so dont be upset if it doesnt work out.|`|JQZDCcyQaa	If your feeding him/her beforehand with formula then he/she is not going to want to feed from you, its best if you just keep trying to put him/her on the breast first and then gradually drop down the number of formula feeds and the amount as your supply grows. Its very possible to get your supply up. Sounds like yuor getting a let down which is great. Just keep expressing every 2-3 hrs, keep putting baby to breast as much as possible to get that stimulation  Have you seen a lactation consultant yet??|`|AA11567932	Breast feeding exclusively or bottle you cannot do both and when you have fed baby formula and then expect him to feed at the breast. you are not only confusing him but your brain wont tell the breasts to produce more milk because you are feeding him by another means.    If you kept at the breastfeeding, and got him latched on properly, there was no reason for there to be a problem. You are right in saying your milk will dry up because the baby is not suckling and demanding it from you.    Im sorry you are in a mess but you have to decide what you are going to do.Nobody can tell you.|`|AA10770446	When baby is hungry it will suckle the hardest, causing you to produce more milk.  Supply/demand.  It is unlikely that your milk is drying up unless you havent been feeding often.  Of course it is better if you continue to try and in the end you will probably be happy you did but it is heartbreaking and if you are a working mom it may be easier for you to just use formula.  Unless you can afford an electric pump it will continue to be difficult to express milk.  I did have this problem but my mother in law rented me an awesome pump which increased my production immediately.  Hope that helps...hang in there.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Well, if you want baby to be encouraged to breastfeed, then you need to offer the breast when baby is hungry and actively wants food, not when they are full of other food and can take it or leave it.

Blood test are 99% accurate and is more accurate then urine test. I say that there is a possibility. Especially if your periods are normally on time.

That's absolutely ridiculous. These are not feeling I would assume of someone who's 23. Who the hell cares if you get blocked? Is it really that big of a deal?    As far as her boyfriends, how can they at all affect you if you live in NY? Are they calling you? Threatening you? Or just telling her to delete you from myspace? This seems so petty and childish, it makes no sense. Disown her? For what? What would your mother call her out on? She hasn't done anything to you. No one can allow somebody to disrespect somebody else. It's YOUR job to keep someone from disrespecting YOU, not your sisters- even if it's her boyfriend doing it.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I would disown her until she smartens up and starts respecting herself and her family more.|`|F0uLexezaa	bf's will come and go but remember, blood is thicker than water|`|JsqMSU9Haa	I don't think you have to go to the extreme of disowning her, just stop talking to her - stop requesting her on facebook and myspace, stop calling, emailing, texting, etc.  if she reaches out to you, fine.  but just back off from all the nonsense and everyone involved - but you don't formally have to tell them off and decide now to never speak to them again.|`|WgyGipBMaa	Just tell her how you feel and then don't talk to her until she's ready to apologize|`|ZQAPiCuBaa	punch her in the face and be like ***** reality check they arent my boyfriends if they disrspect me one more time I'm going to punch them harder.|`|l6QPKcoLaa	Dont disown her just get away from her and let her get the yelling and rudeness from her boyfriend. She's gonna go back to you guys when she gets played. Just leave it alone dont bother her no more keep your distance with her. Yeah family sticks together but some relatives doesnt want that so just let it be. You live your life and you make sure you dont end up like your sister letting a guy talk down to you. If she doesnt want to do anything then you do something dont let a guy talk to you like that especially if his name is not under FATHER in your birth certificate. Just leave her alone in the end she will know who to turn to when things go wrong for her. Blood is thicker than water and she doesnt know that until something bites her in the butt.|`|YqoxcTN9aa	i would not disown her, that is a pretty strong action, i would totally avoid being around her & her b/f, eventually she will catch on & notice, good luck!!!

Note: for everyone else bashing his names, he is obviously from India, thus a different culture and names.

You'll find out quickly that people will be keen to stay at your house, then not want to go. So let your friends stay, but set the standard that they are to leave the following day or after the weekend away. People will take advantage of free rent if you let them. Put your foot down, don't let them scam you into staying a bit longer.   Pay on time for everything!!

And put the extra cash in savings each month so the money goes to good use. Like if our saving for a house or new car or a vacation.

At least when you put the money in savings its going to good use and building intrest.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	ALWAYS set bill money aside first.

jNgh3e3Faa	No. Due dates are an estimate anyway.  My son was overdue. He was born at 41 weeks and 3 days.   His due date was changed three times.   My daughter was born the week of her due date. Not on the exact date though. My youngest was born on a date I picked.   My second son was almost born too early. (dehydration.) They stopped it and he was born a few days before his due date.|`|OMOuxROoaa	everybody is different. my first was born a week early and my second ws born a week late|`|Dpv2a4kVaa	My mom had my older sister 2 weeks over her due date  I wanted to come 6 weeks early, but docters stoped the labor and I came 2 weeks early.|`|tDac6TOKaa	I was due June 22 my water broke that night.

LbkLg4RFaa	A lot of women are leaving motherhood until later in order to concentrate on establishing careers.  Family size has also decreased where a family now has an average of approximately 2 children (about 1.8 per family) when our parents and grandparents were born families with 5-10 children were not uncommon.  My husband's parents who are both in their early 60's had 8 siblings each.  Go back further (1920's) and my grandfather had 11 siblings.    Overall our population is aging all the babies born in the baby boom after World War II are at retirement age and in 20 years many may require government assistance or nursing care dependent on how long super lasts.  Just remember superannuation hasn't been compulsary for that many years and what we will build over a working lifetime of 40 years for retirement a lot of older people have had to build over 10-20years.  Without stimulus to the birth rate it could mean higher taxes etc to provide for the older population.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I wonder the same thing....I would think that it would cause a lot of people to have babies just for the money...|`|aOjMf5SPaa	In oz, the government gives new parents money to pay for baby things. Children in oz are not allowed to go to school without vaccinations. These cost, and part of the payment they receive is only on the condition they have these vaccinations and dr checks.     Aussie men are the best men in the world - fun, friendly, open, great. There are the chavs, but they seem to be a world problem.   Aussie men are not all gay - clearly. And so much better in the sack than europe, uk, indian, men.   Aussie men all want to have a good time and play sports, thats why they're so great, they're fun and toned!!!!!!!!!!    Viva la Australian Men!!!!!!!!!|`|yx5eYC1Oaa	Just another way for the PM to buy votes.|`|JQZDCcyQaa	Just to make other countries jealous, btw its not a huge amount you cant bring a child up on it thats for sure.|`|MmGTFuoTaa	It is supposed to be an inncentive for people who do want to have babies to ensure they are able to supply all baby necessities etc. This doesnt mean there arent a few people who have children just for the money but i tell you kids cost alot more than that!!! The reason the government wants to offer help to people who are having children is to encourage more births. The reason fo this is that Australia is an aging population. The cost of living in Australia is high, more men and women are focusing on careers, buying houses and getting themselves settled before begining a family. This is all contributing to the aging population. I dont know why america and new zealand would have a lower rate in regards to having an aging population, but that is really the question you want answered.|`|jYLZYxDvaa	Because our population was aging, frikkin baby boomers/ generation x  in the day are now getting old, not enough young people to support all the oldies, back in the day people had 6 or 8 kids, now, people are marrying later here and are having less children|`|N3fywkEfaa	The reason for the decline in birth rates is that many Australian women are choosing career rather than family.. Australian women are trying to become more equal and work just as hard as men rather than just been thought of as housewives... obviously women can have a baby then return to work but they seem to put family and even relationships on the backburner until their career is set up and I guess sometimes its too late by then or they just continue to find more personal goals that they want strive to achieve...|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Well I think this question belongs in the political section...    I live in the US and do not know much about the Aussie "birth bonus." But I am assuming it is based on a person's income. If the government can afford to give low-moderate income families a check to help out with new baby expenses, that's great. It's better than the US system of welfare, which is abused by many women who pop out babies just so the government and taxpayers will continue to pay for them to not work outside of the home.
eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	just buy a free and clear of any brand..there will be no dyes or perfumes to irritate babies skin. We use ALL and Purex and have no problems. And you can wash all the families clothing in this stuff too because it's inexpensive as ooposed to Dreft.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	I tried baby detergent,and learned that it simply didn't work on most clothing.     My daughter tended to grow fast, and i couldn't afford to throw things out just because they had a little spit up on them that the baby detergent couldn't handle.     I used the usual stuff, and never had an issue of sensitivity.      Good luck!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You don't have to use baby detergent, but you want to get detergents that don't have any scents in them. Look for All free and clear or anything like that so it doesn't have all the additives in it. Babies can be allergic to the scents and deodorants that are in the detergents so until you are sure they aren't allergic, you shouldn't use them.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I've always used regular detergent. But it does depend on the baby. My son doesn't have sensitive skin or allergies so I can use regular detergent with him. If you've been using it then it is probably okay but I don't think it could cause a cough or make a cold worse.|`|ddP3klT3aa	I would use baby detergent. The perfumes and dyes can irritate some babies. There is ALL for baby and dreft.|`|UdtzY5ciaa	We used regular detergent for our babies clothes and it was never a problem, but it really depends on the baby.  Our daughter never gets sick.|`|z0tn4PoAaa	Baby detergent is a waste of money.  Just get any "free" version of detergent.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	It could be from the detergent, but chances are it's unrelated. Use the baby detergent for a while, and if your baby isn't stuffy anymore, problem solved. Every child reacts differently-My son is almost 3 years old, and his skin is so sensitive we still have to wash his clothes in baby detergent. My daughter is 10 months, and we wash her stuff in regular Tide detergent-She's never had a reaction.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	We use dreft, but if you want something that the whole family's clothes can be washed in Tide Free is fine.|`|mn8tFuhoaa	you should always wash the babies clothes and blankets in baby detergent it is called DREFT.it smells great...and its great on their soft skin.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Any detergent that is "allergen-free" or "perfume-free" will be fine.  I use Dreft, but it's mostly because I like the way it smells.|`|kprKXEOSaa	It is recommended that you wash a baby's clothes separate from the rest of the family's, and in a milder detergent.  This can be for a variety of reasons.  First, a baby's skin is very sensitive, and the harsh detergents that don't bother older kids and adults can cause a rash for the baby.  (Some detergent is always left in the clothing after rinsing.)  Also, there can be things on other people's clothes that gets on the baby's clothes in the wash and irritates their skin.  I've never heard of laundry detergent causing a baby to cough, but anything is possible.  Some babies are also sensitive to the perfumes and colors they put in laundry detergent.  One of my kids has eczema, so I washed his laundry separately for a long time, and I found that the "baby" detergents were really expensive, so I used a fragrance-free, dye-free detergent, I think it was "all" brand.  You'll miss the nice fresh smell of the regular laundry detergent, but if your baby is sensitive to the detergents, it is worth making the switch.
d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	Well it can move around.  Charting is pretty accurate but not perfect.  I read that your thermal shift can be off by 3 days.  Meaning it can take up to 3 days after actual ovulation to shift.  Most women experience a shift in the 24 hours after ovulation.  But if you ovulate in the night then your shift may not happen that next morning.  Also if you are not certain that it was cd 15 last cycle then maybe it wasn't.  Remember too that not all women ovulate every cycle ( I don't sometimes).  You should use a free website like www.fertilityfriend.com to chart.  You just enter your temps in everyday and it does the rest. Really handy.  If you are temping consistantly (same time each day, etc) and you do not see normal ovulation patterns occur then you may want to see your doctor.  I am going to post my chart for this cycle and if you scroll down on that page it lists a few of my earlier cycles.  http://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/hone...    I should also tell you that some of those cycles I was on Clomid, some were natural (you can read in the notes) and this cycle I am on no medications but I am doing acupuncture and it is my most "normal" cycle to date.    Best wishes!|`|jaP0TANdaa	Mine (well, used to) always stays around CD15 or CD16, but many things can delay your ovulation. Since a woman's luteal phase rarely ever varies by more than a day either way, delayed ovulation is usually the cause for abnormally long cycles. Stress, diet, traveling, and exercise can all cause your ovulation to be delayed longer than usual. Your luteal phase will always be about the same though. So, it is possible that you'll see your shift very soon and perhaps there were just some factors (maybe even unknown to you) that caused your ovulation to be a little more delayed this month. Good luck to you and lots of baby dust. I hope you get your temp rise soon.
XYOYml59aa	If you are really pregnant (with his kid) and he is doing this, you should go have a serious talk with him. I would suggest just leaving him (and your other friend). If he was cheating on you with her, then they both aren't treating you how they should, don't care about you, etc. and they aren't worth having around.   I wouldn't just leave him (them) without telling them though, that just makes things more complicted.    The main reason I say leave them is because if they weren't here for you now, then when would they be when you really need it? and it would probably be easier to raise a child without them then having to worry about them also.    This is just my opinion though|`|PLbmKNpvaa	If this guy is in love with you, then he'll realise that he's listening to the wrong girl. If he's not then you don't want to be with him anyway. I'd just be calling him and letting him know that you didn't mean any of it, but that you were feeling a bit insecure about their friendship and that you need more reassurance from him that you're the only one for him. But to be honest, making the snap decision to drive away and telling yourself (and your friend) that you don't want to see him indicates to me that either you have crazy hormones, or that you really DON'T want to be with him but you're just going back to him because you're scared of being alone.  *hugs* good luck.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	Tell him the two of you need to talk, NOW.  Your "bff" was taking advantage of you (I'm assuming you're pregnant, thanks to your headline?) and your mood to steal him from you.  Explain to him that you love him very much and you wish he'd think twice about it.  After all, she screwed you over, who's to say she won't do the same to him.    All you can do is talk to him and hope.  You could have just been in a mood, your hormones could've been reacting, it could've been anything!  Hun, I'm ENGAGED and sometimes I feel like that, where I don't want anyone to touch me and I want to be by myself.  Perfectly normal.|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	well if you are preggers your hormones are out of it, so you will make hasty decisions, get angry quickly and get sad quickly if your bf is the dad, he should understand this.     Dump your friend.|`|Vs6oDeFBaa	Stupid teenager stuff!! Get over it its no big deal.   When you grow up and live a little then you will realise how pathetic your story sounds.    Look around at the true suffering in the world. Not your silly little drama.
qqj7e64Waa	You need to sit down and talk to him and express all your worries to  him.  If he cant accept that you dont feel ready to have sex with him yet then you can do better than him, honey, and sure you love him but is it worth you giving up YOUR virginity for someone who ultimately pressures you into it????  However...  If you do decide to go for it though make sure you use a condom, that way you are 99% guaranteed that you wont get pregnant.  I think that it is sweet that you both want your first time to be with eachother.  Hope i helped and it all goes well with your boyfriend.  xxx|`|ZPBr2kQAaa	Well, most of the guys would say that they will stand beside their girlfriends if they get pregnant.  He's 15, he's obviously not ready to become a father, neither are you.  I can't understand why your relationship HAS to be taken on the next level. Sex is not an essential part of a relationship.  You are still both children. Enjoy your childhood, and don't think about having sex.  Obviously, you are still not ready for sex. Talk to him and make him understand. If he doesn't want to understand your feelings, that means that he doesn't love you, doesn't respect you and that means he's only using you.|`|y1jRV0I4aa	do NOT have sex!    You just said yourself,you are not ready. I know it might seem like your in a bind...you don't want to but are afraid if you don't you will loose your boyfriend? Well he should understand, it's as simple as that. Sex is honestly not something to throw around. If you wait, it will be that much more special.    If he can't understand that, he seriously is NOT worth your time. You need to get the courage to stand up to him and tell him no, or talk to him about it some more.    And the fact that he is talking about ' if you get pregnant"  is CRAZY. If he was REALLY ready to have sex and understood all of the risks he would understand you should never have unprotected sex unless you are READY for the responsibility of a child.  You both are way to young for that.      I did not have sex until i was sure i was ready, and that happened to be when i was 18...and i also ended up marrying the guy later on!    Please be careful, know what your getting yourself into...i would highly advise you to wait.    If not now, you'll understand later in life.|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	How long have you been going out for?    1st time is a special time and if he loves you he will wait another 2 years lols, only kidding! But still i knew a guy for 6 years and it didnt last so really is it worth your virginity?    Wait or not its your choice in the end i just hope he wont screw you over!|`|4zeazkWOaa	I agree with the first answer on this one|`|eksBfc0oaa	If your having second thoughts about having sex then do not engage in sexual activity with him.    If he can not handle that, then it's time to leave him.  He is basing your relationship solely on the notion of sexual activity not a good person.    Why would he be talking about pregnancy?  Does he plan on using protection?     If you cave in and have sex with him its because you both agree|`|hJwk7YaQaa	If i were you i would have a serious talk with your boyfriend telling him that you are not ready right now to have sex, and if he doesn't like you after that he wasn't a good boyfriend after all.|`|hGY08GjRaa	1. Don't let anyone pressure you into  having sex. If he tries to guilt you or pressure you, he does NOT really love you, despite whatever he may say, and you should seriously reconsider staying with him. True love puts the other person's wishes/needs above their own. IF he's not willing to do that, it's not true love (BTW, he does not "need" sex, so don't go turning that around on yourself.. you NEED to be ready and feel right about it before doing it.. get the diff?)     2. If  you think you may even consider having sex, PLEASE get on birth control.. If you are on the pill and take it properly (you can even get on it without your parents knowing.) AND you use spermicidal condoms (or spermicide and condoms) then chances of you getting pregnant are next to 0.. Just use THREE methods of BC simultaneously.. and use them properly, and you won't get pregnant. The reason I suggest three methods is because condoms split, and the pill is not always 100%    3. NEVER have sex without a condom.. Be firm on this.. it's not just pregnancy.. it's other things.     4. Don't listen to anyone who says you can't get pregnant at such-and-such time (ex.. while on your period, right before/after) Listening to that kind of nonsense WILL get you pregnant.  Same goes with teh withdrawl/pull-out method we call people who use that method PARENTS.    5. Keep in mind that no matter how much you THINK you guys are in love, statistically you will NOT still be with each other in 2 years, and will NOT get married. The chances are like 1 in a thousand.  Do you REALLY want to give yourself to someone you'll only be with a short time? (again, statistically, you WONT be with him long)    6.. Yeah.. the MAJORITY of boys who say they'll stand by you if you get pregnant DON'T... even if they're still saying that when you first get pregnant.. Almost ALL end up exiting quietly out the back door... But even if you chose to have sex, if you are RESPONSIBLE, you don't have to worry about getting pregnant.. Just use 3 forms of BC properly and simultaneously..|`|uQyrxxmIaa	Well if youre not ready i dnt think you should do it. Although you want to and your bf wants to, it may not b the best thing. Explain to your bf how yuh relli feel and if he is gd 4 yuh he will understand and wait.   Not Ready - Dnt Do.    Good Luck Thou. xx|`|BBhVUNKOaa	ok.... you are too young and he is too.... now you are not ready.. what makes you think he does... if you do end up pregnant.. what is he gonna do??? he is 15... what.. he is gonna get a job at burger-king??? oh yeah.. you are gonna have the life.. please dont do something that you will regret..|`|7g3IWCBvaa	If you don't feel ready then your probrably not.

Just tell him you're not ready and if he can't accept that then he isn't worth it. If he loves you, he'll understand and wait for you.|`|EBkGtGjDaa	well if you are not ready then don't do it. if he really honestly loves you they he WILL wait until you are ready    i say you two need to talk about it and plan how your going to be ready. ask him like how will he get job support the baby because if you keep it  it takes 200,000 for 18 years. plus you got education college money, health care, sports, and so on      here MOST IMPORTANT read THIS and TALK with him BEFORE sex:    1. what protection would do you plan to use?    2. do you know that protection is not a 100% and can fail? BUT BETTER THAN NOTHING!    3. would you make you partner use protection?     4. what would you do if someone got pregnant or you got an std?    5. you do know it only takes once to get pregnant or get std?    here is a list to make sure ready:    1. when BOTH 100% ready mentally, physically, and emotionally    2, your NOT doing it to prove anything, or to keep someone.    3.you know all the myths about sex, you know all the facts about sex, you know about all the protect how effective they are and what would be best for you.    4. you know all the pros and con and will to take the responsibility for what could happen.    5. you keep learning about sex: http://plannedparenthood.org and http://sexinfo101.com    e-mail me if you have any questions    I'm 19 a virgin ( god damn proud of it) with my bf (virgin too) dating for 11 months and no sex|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	He feels it's the right time? Well, what do YOU want?     Sure, you both want to have it. But that doesn't mean it's the right time by any means. And just because he says he will stand by you if you get pregnant doesn't mean he really will. Sorry to rain on your parade, but this happens every day. You are young, you have an entire life before you - don't do something that could alter your lives forever and not necessarily in a totally good way.     If you do decide to have sex, use birth control, please! Be responsible! If you are old enough to think you should be having sex, then you need to take extra precautions.     If you're not ready, then tell him. DO NOT give in to his wishes and have sex just because he wants to, or because you don't want to ruin your relationship, or because you are afraid of losing him. Any guy who really loves you will understand and wait for you as long as possible until you're ready, whether it's six months or six years. Otherwise, he's just looking to get laid and possibly sees you as his next conquest. Sorry, but that's life. Maybe he won't turn out this way, but believe me - you are not the first teenage girl to be pressured into sex and then end up pregnant as a result.|`|TPnDIaQEaa	Simple: Tell him you aren't ready. Explain you want to wait a while.    If he can't respect that, ditch him.  You need to be treated right, not forced to do things.|`|zdGpaFlfaa	just tell him its gonna have to wait cuz u dont think ur ready and u dont want to have any regrets|`|hstwNjNaaa	If you have sex before you're ready it'll ruin your relationship. Don't let him push you into it, tell him that you do care for him but right now you aren't ready. You are really young, and you should wait until you feel totally ready and comfortable with the situation. If he doesn't want to wait then he doesn't deserve you!|`|0C6VJ8mqaa	you already answered your own question, your not ready, don't risk your future|`|cGRyDCpQaa	If you're not ready, then DON'T DO IT.    & if he can't accept that then he isn't worth being with.|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	if your not ready then dont do it im 18 and im still a virgin sex isnt evething just tell him that u are not ready and if he cant accept that then he doesnt respect u|`|6gthdHpnaa	If your boyfriend truly cares about you he will wait. If not having sex would ruin your relationship, then it's not a very good relationship anyway. He should respect your decision. Tell him exactly how you feel and that you're not ready. If he doesn't respect that, then break up with him. Losing your virginity is a big deal and you want to be sure of your decision when you do decide to have sex for the first time.  Good luck!!|`|Lck9Fg04aa	explain to him that you are not ready and that you feel you guys should wait.    also hun having sex at a young age is one thing but trust me falling pregnant is not a breeze, so if you were to choose to have it use protection or get on birth controll (although it does not always work like it did not for me).     and if he is really into you he will wait till your ready!!!  good luck hunny|`|ySKK7lCyaa	If you are not ready then don't have sex. Talk to him and tell him how you feel about this. When you have sex your saying that you are ready to be a mom. And are you? Trust me it's hard Business.     In the end it is your choice that you have to live with for the rest of your life.|`|9eMYzY0Paa	You aren't ready. You'll have to balance a job, school, and you can no longer have dreams. If you put her/him up for adoption, you'll regret it because you will NEVER KNOW the baby.

I got pregnant and made a mistake. I didn't get an abortion. Good luck.|`|76ac0856e7fef6bc3f67d84b2c345683aa	Best thing to do: don't have sex.  You are way too young and time will pass, you're just beginning to be teenagers and maybe you will soon find out that you might like other guys as well. Don't rush this up. You might regret it after wards. When I was your age, I thought 16 is ideal for starting you sex life. But I'm almost 18 now and I really don't feel ready for it, even though I have a boyfriend for over an year (he's 23). I became more mature and my thoughts and priorities changed completely, and I guess this happens to most of us.     It's no use rushing into this, you have your whole life ahead, and if it's really really true love (which I doubt you can tell for sure) then I guess you should both wait at least until you are physically ready (at 14 your body is certainly not mature therefore not ready for sexual intercourse).|`|9zwSclnLaa	IF YOU ARE NOT READY THAN DON'T DO IT.    That is the bottom line, if both parties are not willing for sex than you don't do it.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	If you are not ready, then do not do it.  If he does not understand this, then he is not worth being with, and is definitely not worth sharing your virginity with.    If he is willing to wait, then go that route.  If he is not willing to wait, suggest he finds someone else who is into sex so young.  Remind him that he will not die, and that a dirty magazine and a hand with some lotion has done it for generations upon generations of horny teenagers.|`|PiqojaIraa	I am 17, I had sex with my gf when she was 14 and i was 14, she bled like a butchered cow.

As I recall, all my babies were about 7-8 months when they first clapped-|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	My oldest was around 10 months old (I think--- maybe 11 months old) and my youngest was almost 7 months old.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	Ahhh, that's so cute!  My daughter is 6 months this Saturday and she doesn't clap yet.  It's definitely something to look forward to.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Jacob will be 8 months on Tuesday Feb 3rd and still doesn't clap..I'd be interested to see what people say here. I'm going to star you.|`|n3IoftMFaa	Around a year - she claps to Irish music when she and Daddy dance in the living room. She loves it - the power of clapping!  She also has recently taken to going "Bapabapaba..." while patting her fatty tummy as she walks around...but she gets that from me.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	My son just started it about week and a half ago. I've been doing patti cake a few times with him. I was singing this song off of tv one day and he just started clapping. I think its the cutest thing. He smiles really big showing is only 2 teeth he has and claps lol. He will be 8 months on 31st.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Both my kids starting clapping around 7 months. It was the cutest thing! My daughter is 10 months now, and she claps every time she gets really excited.
p3NsXo0baa	My son is 6 months old and had his first shower with me today. I sat him in his bumbo on the bottom of the shower lol. He loved it. Perosnally, while my son is still young i wont hold him incase i slipped or something. You should tell your girlfriend to wear a tshirt so her skin isnt slippery.|`|bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	I take showers with both my two year old and my three month old.  The two year old does her own thing, plays in the water (we make it a shower bath and plug the tub).    After I'm washed I bring the baby in with us and wash her.    She's never had a bath alone, I find I save so much time getting all three of us clean at once.|`|1SlD1kZ2aa	i tried sitting my son is his bath seat while i took a shower, and he hated it.  he screamed until i finally just gave up and got out.  if your son likes it, i say more power to you.|`|iAQKD2YBaa	I have baths with my son and my husband has showers with him all the time, my son loves it and we get some bonding time with him as well.     The only bit of advise is that my husband and I never get in or out of the bath/shower with him, if he is going in the shower, I take him in there once my hubby is in there and take him out once he is done and vice versa for me, we are scared that being wet we could slip on the wet floor.    My husband and I love it and so will bubs. Enjoy : )|`|z0tn4PoAaa	When my 2nd was two weeks old, we moved across the country and made many stops.  I didn't travel with an infant tub, so I gave her to my husband, who held her while he showered, I soaped her up and got her out by wrapping a towel around her.  Great memory!      Be careful - they're slippery little things when they're wet!
JjBwydymaa	Yes hunni im in my 2WW...but ive had the feeling of coming on my period...and nausea, kind of throw up yesterday, but only a little came up in my mouth (sorry tmi) However not sure if its linked to implantation or no..

AA11904612	That's what my last preg test came from and it showed two lines, I was def preg|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It might be too soon to test with those. They're not very sensitive and if you still haven't missed your period, you might not get much of a result. You could try another brand that costs more $$ like Clear Blue, EPT or whichever ones say you can test as soon as five days before your missed period. Those are more sensitive and will pick up more hormone levels in your urine.     Good luck!|`|rmse6Mj8aa	doesnt sound like evap lines at all to me. if you are only 11 dpo the lines are probably light because you are testing so early that the hcg levels are very low.  i'd say congratulations are in order. a faint line within the testing time is still a line. it only counts as an evap line if it is outside the 10 mins (and usually it takes a good 30 mins-1 hour for an evap to come up and they are colourless and look like indents).  why dont you test again with another brand to prove it to yourself - i'm saying congrats though - 6 or 7 light lines dont lie.  xxx|`|MW3Br5V8aa	just keep trying!!|`|AsICkz9naa	The lingo is unclear I can't understand fully what your question is.|`|dBD8hDnWaa	Hey, the first two I took, almost 2 weeks ago (Jan 17) were very very faint, barely noticable so i went and bought 2 clearblue digitals, and they both said pregnant.. then i bought another dollar store one yesterday (Jan28) and the like was very dark, i think it just depends on how far along you are, and how much HCG you have produced, but the clearblue will flat out tell you "Pregnant" or "Not Pregnant" I like those a lot better.. Good luck to you.. by the way the clearblues are only like $10 at walmart for a 2-pack.. where I live anyways|`|FSMmeBsgaa	What is your question your  very unclear?????
RduAWmLBaa	I had it with my first pregnancy, and i had to take 5 shots a day it was that bad. I failed the glucose test then had to do a 3 hour fasting test. Im not sure what my levels were though. Most women just need to change their diet and that's all they need to do, but in my case nothing worked but insulin.|`|0WYzUsjMaa	yeah i really do think you do have gestional diabetes, i didnt have it with my son and i didnt know my reading but my cousin had it and she had a big baby|`|DIXhpf5Haa	It looks like you might be a borderline case of gestational diabetes.  You should keep in mind that there is no accurate way to measure the baby's weight/size before birth.  Ultrasounds are incredibly inaccurate, and physical exams vary from doctor to doctor.  There's really no way to say for sure that your baby is already 4 lbs.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	I have diabetes, and my children are going to weigh around 9lbs to 10lbs at birth.  I'm not sure how they were reading your sugar, possibly through an HBA1C test?  Do you live in the US?    I definitely think you have gestational diabetes.  Just check your sugars and watch what you're eating.
Wd7ujHNhaa	I had a tubal ligation at the age of 25...When I turned 30 I decided that I wanted a tubal ligation reversal but no doctors in my area did them.  But my doctor referred me to Reach, who supposedly do tubal reversals and IVF, but when I called, they were very adamant about me going in for an IVF, and told me that the reversal wouldn't work.  I then found Lakeshore Surgical Center in Gainesville, GA.  I called them and had my doctor send my op notes.  They specialize in and only do tubal reversals and I am so glad I had it done last March.  They were very nice and very informative.  I would highly recommend them to anyone seeking a tubal reversal.  Here is their website, which is very informative www.pregnantagain.com.  They have a very high success rate.  It costs $6900 but is considerably less than IVF.  The $6900 covers Everything including your hotel stay.  My husband and I have been trying Since June 1st to get pregnant and finally did in December, but it ended in miscarriage.  But at least I know that the surgery did work and I can continue trying.  Also, at Lakeshore, if they see anything that may prevent pregnancy when they are reversing your tubal that they can fix, they will fix it at the same time as your reversal for free!!!  They have a very high success rate!!!  Please, check out their website!!!  Also want to add that it did not take me 4 to 6 weeks to heal...The doctor told me that I could try to get pregnant as soon as I felt like it.  We started trying within a week after the reversal.  The recovery was really quick.|`|m4mZMIMjaa	Your whole life is about your children.  You already have three beautiful children who need you.  Do you need more surgery?  I undrstand about wanting children, believe me.  I am 26 right now and am childless.  I'm feeling the desperate urge, but  I know that there are so many children out there already who need a family.  Maybe you should consider adoption or foster care.  You can help someone who desperately needs it while satisfying the urge and teaching your own children about helping others.  Not to mention you won't have to go through the surgery.    That's just my opinion.  After hearing my best friends husband talk about not "wanting someone elses mistake" I feel VERY strongly about helping out other children if you are in a position to.    Not trying to push my viewes on you, just offering options.  Good luck!|`|Nxv4qusRaa	It is something to consider. But think of how stable your life is now-- working, paying bills. People are getting laid off left and right lately, so job security is important. Insurance as well.  Maybe you can ask your kids how they would feel about having a new baby brother or sister?  I am 21 and have a 3 year old brother, the age difference is huge but it makes me love and appreciate him even more.  Your older kids will feel more like a parent, and can help out.. while that may be good or bad, its another thing to think about.|`|PPgIQNB8aa	I just had a tubal reversal in November. I am 27 with 5 step kids and 2 of my own. I think it's a great that you want more children. Children are a blessing. So, I would say go for it. It takes about 4-6 weeks to heal. After that you can try to conceive. My tubes were just tied so I think I have a 80 percent chance. Good Luck to you!
ab2b4534f1de26ad668f25eea47a4369aa	good chance because the sperm can live up to 3 days.  Although, a miscarriage can  throw off your cycle some.|`|492180924fe32381f3e8cd7774074fe9aa	take your temp every morning before you get out of bed.. when you see a slight change in temp. thats your fertile day.. and thats the day you will want 2 do the wild thang.. lots of luck on that  ; )|`|8044e884aadbc61c9f7791571c7c43e3aa	Yes , it happened to me, I know have an eight month old to prove it!

9OsjdsrZaa	It sounds like you are eating everything that you should.      You should be eating about 300 more calorie a day than usual.      If you have no dietary restraints like Gestational Diabetes...you are eating great!      I have GD, so I am on a controlled diet and really have to watch what I eat.    I have 1 egg and a piece of whole wheat toast for breakfast  Mid morning snack:  Apple and a piece of cheese  Lunch:  Sandwich (turkey-not deli, cheese lettuce tomato) carrots or salad  Mid afternoon:  Banana and peanut butter  Dinner:  home cooked dinner - usually a meat or fish, veg. salad and an orange (helps with iron absorption)  evening snack:  no sugar added ice cream.  Not so bad.      So as you can tell...my meals are boring...but I am never hungry.  It doesn't stop the craving though!  Man to have a bag of crisps! lol    Good luck with your pregnancy.  I am 32 and counting...on number 4!        As long as you are feeling satisfied and not hungry, you are doing fine!    Good Luck!|`|wENdWT5kaa	Don't worry about your weight, please put the health of your baby first before your vanity.     You can worry about your weight after she/he is born. Your baby needs all the nutrients he/she can get. You have a growing baby in your tummy. The last thing you need to be worrying about is your weight.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I don't know if its too much as you really didn't give portion sizes for the bowl of soup or beef casserole. But i did notice you only eat potatoes. Where are the fresh fruit and veggies? Other than an apple?      I ate this yesterday:    B~ lite english muffin with 2 egg whites, banana and strawberries  S~ yogurt with berries  L~ High fiber tortilla wrap with lean turkey and lettuce and tomatoes, low fat mayo, small salad with lite dressing  S~ High fiber bar and a glass of skim milk  D~ Chicken breast with carrots and cous cous. salad with lite dressing and glass of skim milk  S~ Skim milk and 1 cup of high fiber cereal with fresh blue berries.     I am 26 weeks and have gained 19 lbs so far. This is the diet the doctor gave me to follow. Also it is in the book what to eat when you are expecting.     I think you are eating too many things like biscuits and not enough fresh produce. If you are eating properly you wont have to worry about gaining weight.|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	thats normal eating alot durging pregnancy is normal just eat heathly|`|OMOuxROoaa	you are fine and eating healthy....add some peanut butter in there or something high in folic acid. you will be fine. If you are that worried get an workout routine....there are many safe options out there for pregnant women.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	There's no such thing as eating too much when pregnant, just eating too much of the wrong thing! Sounds like you're eating pretty healthily most of the time. You will just have to come to terms with the fact that any weight that you put on, you're SUPPOSED to put on. Dieting during pregnancy will only cause problems for both you and the baby.  It looks like you're doing pretty well, but ask your doc if they think your diet is ok.|`|AsICkz9naa	Sounds to me like you are doing really well. I understand that you don't want to gain loads of weight. I think that your diet is really healthy too. Any weight you gain from now on though will be on the baby and not you! So keep up the good work. You are definitely not eating too much.
X7rPWJU8aa	I think in today's society spanking is frowned on because to many people were spanked to a point of over kill or just because we have to be " p c . when I was a kid belts paddles and an open hand were something I expected as a kid needing some correction. I don't spank my kids unless it is because of direct defiance and when I do a swat with my hand or belt will get their attention just fine. I think there is a fine line in which spanking and abuse are governed. ask yourself is spanking really necessary at this point. sometimes i think parents react out of anger instead of trying to correct. I feel that reacting out of anger teaches one that anger should = hitting. But spanking a child when the adult is calm and doing it out of the desire to correct is a necessary part of growing up|`|r07BwhO1aa	I personally do not use a belt or paddle, I am hand to bare @*** type mom.  But if your parents did and used  it correctly and got the point across, more power to them.    Oh and yes there is differently a huge difference between sitting your kid down and talking to them and then spanking them VS getting drunk and knocking the crap out of them.  People sadly don't see it that way, to some hitting a child not matter what is abuse, and every time an anti spanking Nazi says something like that I secretly wish their kids grow up to be horrible teens and then they will wish they had spanked them!!!  I know it is evil but I have an evil side!!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	As a grown up that was punished that way, yes, I think it is abuse. There is no reason to use a tool to hit your child.     I can see a swat on the behind, but i do not agree with a belt or paddle. My father used to hit me with a belt and it is not a good relationship.  I do not hit my child, and she is a well adjusted child who is good natured. I think hitting is used when people cannot communicate.|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	Well let's see.  Say you annoyed one of your friends, and he hit you with a stick or whipped you with his belt.  Would that be assault?  Of course it would!!!    So how come it's ok to hit our kids with these things?|`|8haUJ5nuaa	is it abuse, i think that depends on the way it is given and the reasons on why it was given.    in the UK it is illegal to smack with any implement, you may only use your hand and it must not leave any permanent markings ie bruising.    Evan if it was legal in the uk to use implements, i think i would still only use my hand to smack as i think it does just as good a job and gets exactly the same message across.    CJ|`|iAQKD2YBaa	I am not against spanking a baby lightly on the legs or the hand, but spanking with an object is wrong, with a hand there is full control on the hardness of the smack, with a paddle, it can be harder than expected.    We are in 2009 and there is no excuse for a child to be smacked with anything but a gentle hand. There is also things like communication (If the child is old enough to understand a smack, they are old enough to be spoken to), time outs, taking things off them, grounding etc.|`|9e93f5c1efa5df7e8ecf9b696a8a121caa	Spanking is a abuse.We all want to discipline our kids in one way or the other.But there is a lot of difference when it comes if they are spanked becoz of love.|`|bc50adcd7a4cda84a5f4451579fa7554aa	i only spank with the palm of my hand and only when it's something major (lying on adults, beating up sister, things like that). i will not spank my children using an object. i don't see it as abuse at all though, it just isn't something i am willing to do to my child.     there is a huge difference in what you said about the drunk parent. i have never hit out of anger. that is dangerous. people have to know when to punish and when to walk away, hitting while drunk and angry is wrong. my kids know i love them and they know why they are getting disciplined because we always discuss it before and after the punishment.|`|kRmuf3gfaa	Obviously there is a difference.  When the kid does something wrong, depending on how young they are put them in the corner or ground them to their room. If they continue being bad, then spank them.    It's not abuse, as long as the paddle/belt isn't leaving like, huge welts and ****.    The dad coming home drunk and hitting you 'cause he's mad is totally different from the other one.  'Cause that's just f*cked up.|`|YvZqp4QRaa	First of all, hitting a child with any inanimate object is abuse. I too was hit with a belt, a spachula, ETC. It didn't make it right. Strike your child, they are "sorry" for a min or two. Take away their prized possesions (xbox, psp, cd player, stereo, etc), they are sorry for a long time.    Second, your retarded of course its diff. just still wrong.|`|PiqojaIraa	Ya my parents never hit me, but I did my **** and got into college, I am only 17.      Something you idiot parents will never understand so I'll be blunt.    Treat a kid like a dog, the kid will act like a dog. Treat a kid with respect, and he will respect you back.|`|36807124bd8573520e16d41ac3f7e4e0aa	just use caution, and kneel on their level and make them understand what they did wrong isn't acceptable.|`|7juyt0Beaa	No, I don't. My parents use to spank me with a paddle when I was younger, and I never felt abused (it hurt though! lol). There's a difference, like you said. It wasn't like my mom or dad would have a bottle of alcohol in one hand, the paddle in the other, and just be swinging away in a fit of rage. It was always very controlled, and I always knew ahead of time. I think punishment should hurt, either mentally or physically, otherwise where's the "punishment" in punishment? Like grounding hurts mentally because you want to do stuff but can't. Spanking hurts physically. I think they both are on equal levels. Both can be taken too far. The important part is that the parent communicates that they love their child, even when they punish them.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I will start out by saying that I spank (with an open hand and for very select behaviors). I also was never spanked as a child but remember my brother getting spanked w/a belt by my dad for having dip. It seemed really traumatic to me at the time and I went outside to avoid the tension. I would not use a belt on my child and don't believe it's right because it's used to create much more intense pain....however, the method used is still a whole different scenario than physical punishment used when someone is drunk and angry (I don't think it can ever be properly metered or justified if someone is already half ******)
oUcLSDZ6aa	Walmart.com    I bought most of my baby stuff at Walmart and Toys R Us. The prices were more than reasonable (usually) and of great quality.     Congratulations!|`|AA11904612	you can find some cute baby clothes at Marshalls and Ross, burlington coat factory...and yes walmart and toysrus|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Target! Or try Target.com-There's a better selection of baby room furniture online.|`|64tdPWLGaa	Craigslist is AWSOME!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Walmart ... craigslist and consignment stores are great too! (especially for things like jumpers, exersaucers, toys, high chairs, dressers/changing tables, and strollers..)  There is nothing wrong with these used items most of the time and many of them look brand new. (or actually are)      Always buy cribs and car seats new.
FkVMOTZtaa	There is 1 umbilical cord for each baby, so they get the vitamins and nutrients that they need to grow, as well as air etc.    SO 2 cords|`|mc6YtaRbaa	There are 2, one for each baby so they both get food.|`|kVBDpAMTaa	2     =)|`|Z75ceQa0aa	There are 2 but there could either be one or two placentas.  You should find out ASAP.  One placenta and 2 babies usually means identical twins.  This is a hi risk pregnancy and you should be seeing a maternal-fetal dr instead of your regular OBGYN.
uhj76Fkpaa	Yes it affects pregnancy.You shouldn;t dye your hair if you think that you might be pregnant.Leave it for later!|`|Vjz5VeWaaa	you cannot dye your hair when you are pregnant so i would wait for the results|`|iAQKD2YBaa	Dying your hair is a big no no when pregnant as it can cause miscarriage, so I would assume that it is the same when trying to conceive.    I would say better to be safe than sorry,wait until you get your results.    Good luck, I hope it is a positive : )
sDqS69Q6aa	I think that this is a question of debate among medical ethicists.  I think that people used to say that it was when fertilization ocurred, but then when abortion became common and people started to want to due stem cell research, it got redefined.  I go with fertilization, because that offers  the greatest protection for human life.  I had a friend in college studying embryology who said it when implantation occurred.
se3RwEWyaa	Conception is the day that the fertilized egg implants. Fertilization is once the sperm mates w/ the ovum creating a zygote. Once the zygote snuggles itself into the uterus then it begins to secrete the HCG hormones that is detected by preg tests. So you are not out of the water sort-to speak until the egg is in the safety of the uterine lining =conception. Good luck! lots of baby dust***|`|SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    I done a little research for you and here's a few web pages you can look at, as fertilization and conception both confuse people x    http://www.femalehealthissues.co.uk/conc...  http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_concep...    They both explain that conception is when the sperm penetrates the outer layer of the egg, and once the sperm reaches into the egg its conceived, and fertilization is taking places.  When the egg makes it into the uterus and attaches to the lining of the womb this is called implantation.  I'm not sure where answerer 1 got her answer from. Best of luck and hope this information helps.  xx
gRtmFa1maa	Usually when your pregnant, your breasts get tender. So I wouldn't consider a lack of breast tenderness to mean you are pregnant.    If your period is due Feb.9, you would  have ovulated around Jan 25. So you did have sex in your fertile period....so if you didn't practice birth control pregnancy is still a possibility. But since today is the 29th...you wouldn't have symptoms of pregnancy yet.    .|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	Your stomach wouldn't be getting hard until the baby is big enough to stretch the stomach and fill things out.  Mine didn't get really hard until about the 25th week.|`|lFPsPzxzaa	if u're period is late take a test|`|Y0vkS6bKaa	It is not because your breast is hurting when your period come's. It is because of some chemical problem's, you need a doctor check up.
oUcLSDZ6aa	The only 100% way to not impregnate someone is to not have sex with them.    Condoms are the best method of contraceptive IF used with another form of contraceptive. Condoms are great because they are the only method that helps to prevent transmitting disease. But condoms are only effective if used correctly, and even then, not fool proof.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	condoms are not 100 % accurate. The box will tell you that.     But if you are using it the correct way, putting it on before any vaginal contact and it does not break, you cannot get pregnant.   Just make sure you never enter your partner without the condom or you risk the chance of pre-ejaculate causing pregnancy.|`|a6EEfOQTaa	yes the condom could break|`|HpWCjBv6aa	The best form of birth control is abstinence.  However, since you've already decided to partake in sex, then your best bet is going to be using either condoms and spermicide, or condoms and hormonal birth control (pills, patch, ring, shot, etc).    Condoms, by themselves, are 89% effective (typically).  This number is adjusted for human failure, as well as condoms breaking and other factors. This means, just using condoms by themselves, 11 in 100 women will get pregnant in one year.    The more forms of birth control you use, the less chance you have of an unplanned pregnancy.|`|0bgsTaSIaa	Whats the revenge of a bastard . Someone working in a condom factory, putting pin holes in  condoms...|`|2Sxhtuv0aa	of course, read the disclaimer on the box.    abstinence/chastity is the only known form of contraception that is 100% effective.  In other words, Just say NO.|`|YCKnnbsraa	Condoms are great, but they aren't 100%. More like 96% or something. You could do a combination of condoms and birth control though. That brings down the possibility of a pregnancy quite a bit.|`|ITgPCvzYaa	condoms is a GOOD contraceptive if you use it well. Yes, you can still get pregnant becasue some condoms may have tiny holes in them, allow your sperm to go thru. yes you can rely on them if u use other contraceptives with them. in my opnion, condoms arnetr the best birth control way becasue its risky and cheap...cheap things often dont work as well as expensive.|`|Dl7bbcTVaa	Did the condom break?|`|AsICkz9naa	Yes, but the chances are small. The pill is more reliable than a condom, statistically.
Iz5tNA5aaa	Your friend is an a**hole for saying that.  You did the right thing by standing by your gf and supporting her through the decision.  I feel that you should have had a say in the ultimate decision since you were the father, but to each his own.    You did the right thing.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	well how old are you for one? and two...I don't support abortions in this case. For you to run when she found she was pregnant would have been cowardly though..so sticking by her side is not a bad thing.|`|6gthdHpnaa	You should support your girlfriend in her pregnancy, it's not fair that she has to deal with a child and pregnancy and all kinds of problems and the guy not have to do anything. You weren't wrong to stay with her.|`|OnuiGOkvaa	no man u should always be there for ur woman u did a wonderfull thing i think that is what we call a man to me a man is someone who stands out and does something others wouldn have done easily hold on to those kinds of thoughts|`|hstwNjNaaa	I assume you guys are both young? It was a good thing to support her, she wanted an abortion and like you said, it's her body. It's a difficult decision to make, and even harder when she wants to end the pregnancy because she isn't ready to be a mother and has her boyfriend pushing her to keep a child. It would have been hard for both of you but ultimately the decision is hers.    People will go crazy because she had an abortion, but don't feel guilty for supporting her. Only you and her know what's best for the two of you.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	One day when she gets older she's gonna think about that baby and she will regret it. And when she's holding her first kid that she births in her arms that baby will be on her mind. You should have talked to her because now she will have to deal with the guilt and depression of it all. You know, you don't escape things like that. Woman who have abortions also have a higher chance of womanly cancers. And that was your baby too, you did have a right to at least speak up. I wish that I could wish you guys the best but abortion is a horrible thing and now ya'll have to live with the guilt|`|qqj7e64Waa	I think that your guy friend is obviously a jerk -no offence- and that you are obviously a good guy for supporting her and not running away.  Good on you  xx|`|D2bI2T0paa	i think it was sweet of u to support her and obvioulsy ur friend is a jerk so don't listen to him....|`|3IXDx9nhaa	Good for you.  You can rest easy and know forever you did the right thing by her.  However, I hope you learned an important lesson from this situation.  Have you put yourself in the situation if she chose to have the baby and how it would affect your life, both your lives, the baby's life and all your futures!?  I think you have been given a gift for your future and a chance to recognise the importance of protection in the future. I also hope you realise how enormous this decision was for your girlfriend and upsetting it was.  It will be in her mind for a long time if not forever.  The other thing that troubles me is that you young people don't realise that you, as a boy could give her cervical cancer in the way of cancer. Google , human papillomavirus and look up STD facts.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	Your friend is so wrong that it hurts.  I'm so glad you were sweet and supportive of her.  I knew a couple (well, now exes) who got pregnant in high school, and she had an abortion.  Instead of sticking by her, he would constantly berate her and call her a murderer.  He made her feel like crap for her choice.    I'm for abortion period, and I believe that if you don't like them, then you shouldn't have one.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	You definately did the right thing, and you've shown that you're the better person for staying with her and supporting her. It takes two to tango and clearly your mate doesn't understand that! It shows who's the better person out of you and him, that's for sure!|`|zjuMrDmGaa	You were being a man and your friend is still a child. It's not wrong to do responsible things.|`|upK8oN2oaa	You sound like a mature young man. You supported your gf through what was probably one of the hardest decisions in her life so far. Your friend sounds immature and i wouldn't want to be his gf. Those telling you stuff like 'i don't believe in abortion in your case' are idiots because obviously, especially if you are really young, you don't have the capacity to provide all that the child would need or that the child would deserve. Adoption isn't always an option for some women as they feel that they could not mentally cope with knowing their child is out there and I'm sure your gf was fully informed of all the options and I hope given some counselling before the abortion took place.    The only advice I can give is to practice safe sex from now on with her taking the contraceptive pill and you wearing condoms.|`|da9b10820ab3418773c06c2801187326aa	I think you were right to support her and your reasons for supporting her and her decisions are very decent. But you should have had a little say in the decision but overall I think it was her decision for an abortion.|`|PiqojaIraa	Ever heard of pulling it out?
wENdWT5kaa	What do you mean letting her do things that she shouldn't be doing? What exactly is he doing?    Legal custody means that he can not take her out of the state or country. He doesn't have to ask you for permission for every little thing but he does need to let you know what his plans are for the day. Going to amusment park, etc.    But i'm not lawyer, so you may want to ask your lawyer to get a correct answer.|`|hieQHR0daa	It means that you are totally responsible for your child. If your child requires surgery or medical treatment it cannot be given without your agreement.  If you feel your child is being allowed to do things which you do not approve of you need to see your lawyer and have some legal agreement drawn up regarding her father's access. If you think he will listen to your concerns and act on them you probably don't need to take it that far.|`|OMOuxROoaa	first of all like what. it sounds since the father is still around you have primary joint legal custody. this means that the child lives with you for most of the time. Neither of you can leave the state w/o permission etc. It is your child and since you have primary you have the right to tell him him to give you 24 hrs. before visitation etc. You do have the right in any circumstance to stop him from doing things you believe to be un ethical for a five year old if he don't like it tell him you will see him in court.|`|Ozf5gAHWaa	You need to be more specific.  If he is letting her do something like stay up past midnight or watch PG-13 movies, well, you probably can't stop stuff like that.  But, if he is letting her travel out of state with a friend or letting her go on school field trips that you don't approve of, you can stop things like that.
4f4dd4763be48509030739baf9bf591faa	There is a website that you can try which is www.babynamegenerator.com or type something like baby names into the search bar of your internet page.

It is called the Baby Name Wizard.  Most of the baby books are like a dictionary of names.  This book is MUCH easier to read, has the names grouped by "trends" like: classic, nature, nothing can rhyme with it, have cool nicknames, surfer, biblical, ethnic....  It also gives you the frequency of the name and popularity over the last 100 years.  I got mine from Chapters.  Good luck!|`|2fd8f50a7139a42e8a4eeeef290a2343aa	preston is a good name|`|397ebaeca53bb9708ba94da2330fb64caa	<a href="http://www.babynamecombos.com/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.babynamecombos.com/home.html</a><br>  <br>  Found that site when I was doing some research on a fav name of mine.

0fb47df0cc925f49516f04b0a22059b9aa	yes by like a week it says in the commercials but it's a waist of money on a test. at least wait till she's late. or instead of a pregnancy test it will only be an expensive " her period is coming in a few days" test.<br>  <br>  don't know how many test would have been to waist if me and my wife tested before her expected date to see if she was late. took over a year.|`|AA11356502	Yes.<br>  You are already pregnant by the time you miss your period.  It takes a while for there to be enough hormones in your system for it to register on a test.  That is why they tell you to wait until you have missed a period before testing.  But there are tests out there that you can use up to a week before your missed period, or anytime if you really think that you are.  They may not be completely accurate if you test too early, so you may want to buy more than one.|`|AA11713121	Yes, I took a pregnancy test 4 days before my period and it was positive. Blood test the next day was also positive.<br>  <br>  Also be aware that just because a test says you can take it up to 5 days before your period is based on the level of pregnancy hormones in your body (hcg). Not everyone who is pregnant is going to get a positive results before they miss their period.|`|47f9c71af5518f73b69c3eb29cfe49b4aa	Yes..the "First Response" brand can determine if a woman is pregnant 3 days before her expected period. Good luck I hope you get the result you are looking for!!|`|61a4283ca1ee4c77650bcf5272bc8b69aa	Some of the more sensitive tests you can, but for an accurate test its best to wait till after the test cause they can show false negitive.|`|7cc9554bc615a51810590604ac75fe68aa	the first response pregnancy test can tell you 5 days before your period but it doesnt work on everyone because it depends on the level of hormones. doctors say to take the test first thing in the morning when you wake up because the level of hormones are higher when you first urinate.good luck!!!|`|d401ab6fb969b520de848bc4d5b0561eaa	It is possible but unlikely for a test to show a true positive before being late for her period.  It is possible if she conceived soon after her previous cycle and has been pregnant for a couple of weeks.  At-home pregnancy tests measure certain hormones in the urine that the mother's body develops as the embryo becomes the fetus.  In very early pregnancy, there is often not enough of the hormone(s) to show up as a positive on the at-home pregnancy test.|`|515bede641f27103c7ec5fd5087235e7aa	Yes, You can find out with the ones that are 4 days before missed period.. But, I took all mine before my period and never got a possitive with either pregnancys. Sometimes a woman has to wait till the day they expect there period to get a possitive...Ive bought all the test they had on the market and on internet, just for the fun of it I called myself the pee test girl cuz Id start like 6 days after sex to try to see if i was pregnant, and never got a poss till the day I expected my period I have a 8 month old daughter and a baby on the way!!!|`|58b0cf62cf30c7942a58ed4b8c7da777aa	YES!!!!!!! But it's a chance that there's more than one baby. Elevated HCG,(pregnancy hormone that turnes the stick positive)<br>  can either be because she got pregnant early, or becuase there's more babies! I showed pregnant 7 days before my missed period. I knew 9 days before.It was twins but one didn't make it after 6 weeks. Good Luck! And baby is a blessing! Merry Christmas|`|e55657a9cd3d06792b4f49c856e98de0aa	yes it can.. it just depends on when she got pregnant it takes a home pregnancy test two weeks to show up pregnant after she got pregnant

MW3Br5V8aa	if you go to www.babycentre.co.uk u can work it out from there and get loads of good tips...|`|sbfm5rCAaa	According to the following website: http://www.askdramy.com/pcalctry.html you most likely conceived around the 2nd of April. I would say it is too difficult to tell as it could have been the 27 March and the sperm stayed in your body  for a while or you could have ovulated later and then you would have conceived  around the 5th April.    If there are 2 different guys then in this case the only way to tell is a paternity test.    Sorry I can't be of more help :(
ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	Tagliatelle is a pasta, it's called that because of the shape.  Sort of like Fettuccine.  Why would you ask?  Pasta is pasta.|`|c1399de03ef647ddb85fb6f6fd6f6c2baa	Yes, it's just pasta, eat as much as you like x|`|GjuRYsITaa	yes why wouldn't it be??|`|AA12279950	Indeed it is.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Yes sure.

rmse6Mj8aa	possibly. then again possibly not there's no real way to tell as we get twinges from time to time, but when ttc we tend to react to everything our body does as a 'sign'.  having said that though, yes it could be as implantation typically occurs 6-12 dpo  and you o'd approx 21st placing you at approx 9 dpo. it takes at least 5 days for the egg (if conception occurs) to get to the uterus and then implantation happens. you may have heard of implantation bleeding. this is very rare happens in 20% of pregnancies, and is usually pinkish, brownish and you see it only 'when you wipe'.   babyhopes.com has a lot of info on all this you may want to have a read?    i hope that it is implantation and you get your bfp in 5 or 6 days when your period is due and you test!  good luck    xx
znjl6WrWaa	well it's possible, but you can stay effaced and dilated for weeks! Don't stress about it. You're almost there, and if the baby were to come now she/he should be fine.|`|9ffa956c569429ec4edaa430974fd5a1aa	I had my last two t 36 weeks they came right home with no problems good luck|`|DgK6tkNhaa	hi it is not a must that ur baby comes on the 40 week he may come before or even some days later. this is normal and as u 1 cm dilated you will continue to dilate you can slow it by alot of bed rest and no stress. best of luck
aJLx0nhNaa	I don't know if you're ever totally sure that the time is right.  I do think that, given the choice, financial security is the one thing that really makes it a lot easier.    I also would not have a child with someone I had only been seeing for 9 months.  Babies are forever, and it takes longer to know if someone is the right person for you, and will be a good parent.|`|SDjrojZXaa	that is hard to answer because its different for everyone. some people never get the "right" time and it comes down to can you give your child the necessities and pleanty of love. I would make sure your relationship is ready for any storms and  you have medical insurance weather by you or the government. if you need assistance you can check in to the WIC program. as far as if you are ready emmotinally thats a very personal question that only you can answer.|`|AA12279950	The time will be right when you don't have to ask this question any more and you're able to take the decision without asking the opinions of people you don't know.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Get married first, that's always a good place to start.  Just invite your parents and go to the justice of the peace, it doesn't have to cost a fortune.  You'll solve a lot of problems by not putting the cart in front of the horse.  Make a lifetime committment to each other first, then have a baby.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	your ambivalence says it all: WAIT. Additionally, I would say that parenting together takes more then 9 months of a relationship as your foundation. Let your relationship grow and a baby will come when you feel more ready and secure.|`|0VHolTVEaa	There is never a "right time" but if i were you i wold get married first and be financially stable because having a baby is expensive. Hope that helps|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	idk but listen to your gut. cause im 17 weeks and now buy my self pregnant. my bf wanted a baby to and we were togeher for 1 1/2 years and when i got pregnant everything changed..     everyone is diffrent but dont forget your going to be tied with him for the next 18 years.|`|udch2v5gaa	If you don't think you can handle a baby right now then don't let him pressure you into having one, trust me I had no idea just what I was getting myself into and my pregnancy was pretty much planned. Just make sure you are ready, after all, you and only you will be the mother. Hope this helps.|`|LnWFVZeZaa	I would wait til you are more established,especially with this economy.You two haven't even been together that long, everything maybe good now but a baby can change alot of things. I would say just take the steps to become more stable before having a child, if you are going to plan it. Possibly open up an extra account and start saving up that way. If he loves you he will respect your decision just to wait before having a baby. It's a really big responsibility. Good luck with everything.
kprKXEOSaa	If you're saying he spits up a little when he burps, yes, that is normal.  You should feed the baby until they don't want to eat any more, don't try to control portions the way you do with an adult, babies don't overeat.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Some babies spit up more.  The valve at the top of their stomach is not a well-developed as an adult.  This is why the can drink a bottle lying down, which would make you or I gag.    If he doesn't seem distressed when he does it, and just shoots some spit up out of his mouth when he burps, it's not a problem.
o0Q7LmMsaa	well were i come from there are a bunch of slang words such as    1. i'm sure you were (used as sarcasm, when you don't believe or you think that  what the person did was foolish )  2. no shot ( used for saying not at all, basically saying no)  3. definitely (self explanatory)  4. word ( it has so many meanings lol)  5. cornball (someone who acts corny or tells corny jokes)  6. cool   7. oh really (sarcasm)  8. lame (used to tell someone their borring)  9. tight (means mad)  10. book it (means to run fast)  11. troop (means a long distance of walking) example-> that's a far troop  12. killed it (meaning someone did something really good and it was awesome)   example you killed that dance, it was awesome    edit: i thought of more slang    for relationships they say   shorty, baby,  my love, ma, babygirl, lil mama  dating = going out   sugar= kiss --> example--> give me sugar means give me a kiss    technology  kick = sidekick    ipod= lol where i come from everyone calls anything that plays music an ipod    hit me up = means to contact through phone or just to simply call or text them.    textaholic --> a problem that many of my friends have lol just kidding, it means someone who is constantly texting    kick rocks=  is nicer way of saying get lost, but depending on how it is said it can be offensive      =)|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Really good:  sick, hard, raw    Really bad:  messed up, that sucks    They always call eachother Boo, Wifey, etc. in relationships.

Good:  Sick, cool, awesome, chill, wicked, sweet, tight.    Bad:   Dirt, waste, chintzy, sucks/sucky, lame.    Other slang:  Gyp = rip-off (ie. What a gyp man.)  Dig = like (ie. I dig it.)  Man  Dawg (ie. Sup, dawg.)  Props = kudos  Ride = car  Snake = thief, soundrel    Just throwing in teen slang isn't going to make it sound like a kid.

I hope this helps a little.|`|6ijJuvPXaa	girls and boys tend to speak different     i wud say awsome is her thing...depends were ur from    im from the uk so....    sick/mint means good   eg. aww thats sick (thats really good...could be talkin about a dance move or a drawing)     hmm not sure about realy bad erm.......... no cant think of the top of my head|`|ehEIpHgYaa	not awesome haha thats gay  oh and gay is like bad or whatever mass gay is really bad or whatever um cools still used|`|BktjgS2naa	chillin- hanging out  hangin'- hanging out|`|XHVdccr1aa	if somethin aint cool we say its wack. if it is we say its tite. both can be used as jus wack or tite.  like thats wack, or thats tite. we still say what up, and also whats good, n when leavin, we're bouncin or dippin. shoes r kicks, n cars are whips. a necklace is a chain. also for somethin cool we say ballin. all of this works, but every teen that uses slang uses cursing.
1NDHSSqwaa	At 8 months my son could - sit, crawl (on his hands and knees), pull himself to standing with assistance, cruise along furniture, pull himself to sitting from laying down, eat finger foods, eat table food, give kisses, give hugs and say dada.    At 9 months (his current age) he can do all this and has also learnt to stand up without support and pull himself to stand without support. He is also still completely toothless!    EDIT - i think a lot of the people on here are being very harsh. There is nothing wrong with wanting to compare your baby to another - i know this happens with almost all the mums that go to playgroup. C'mon ladies - it's only natural to want to say how great your baby is!|`|7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	I agree with the top poster .. lucky for you i am pleased for you   Edit to the person that thumbs down ..Thomas was ahead of his twin sister in everything then he stopped, he is 11 non verbal and still in nappies/diapers, so believe me i know its OK to compare your children but even as a Mum you do not know whats around the corner as we didn't be thankful with everything in life ..|`|UxKtGC9maa	Firstly, I think it's sometimes good to know what other babies are doing and how other parents are coping with their developing baby so ignore all those on here who have said you are showing off how well your baby is developing or not to compare babies. You should be proud your baby is doing so well, i am shocked your baby has 4 teeth already as my 8 month old daughter is still yet to cut her first, i can see it under the gum and praying for it to come through lol. My daughter is trying her very best to try to crawl but yet to achieve it, but so funny to watch. She does sleep well tho 7pm til about 8am which i am very thankful for, weaning and feeding very well. So we both have well behaved babies so far lol, and you be proud that your baby is doing so well. And like my daughter, i am sure your son is beautiful haha. You have nothing to be worried about x|`|e9kvxIc3aa	He's doing quite well!! Congrats!!  Ours just started crawling regular, he's 9 months. He only has 2 teeth, the top are coming...doesn't say anything, very quiet. He doesn't sleep nearly as well as yours...Sounds like you're very lucky!|`|JqvfrLTbaa	You cannot compare babies ..they are all different, take a look at Thomas is our autistic wonder ...god bless your son he has a beautiful smile !|`|1f7454e7b81f8ce36a73c7aca09a8c24aa	You sound like you're doing an awesome job:D    At 8 months my little one could sit up, crawl and cruise around furniture but he didnt say anything meaningful:) He also was baby led weaning and he ate finger foods and 3 meals a day of table foods mushed up ( mild curry, pasta dishes etc)|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	It actually sounds more like you are saying "Look how clever my little one is, bet you wish yours was that clever", and I don't have a small baby to compare to, just how it looks from the outside.|`|Lf1GMmyaaa	Sounds about normal to me...    PS: If the baby doesn't begin to walk don't freak out like my wife and claim its cerebral palsy.  My son walked when he wanted to...lol.    They can be just lazy sometimes, but from what you described it all sounds like you are on the right track to me!      Good Parenting, its good to see people that actually ask questions that are not stupid!
UxKtGC9maa	it doesn't matter how many times you do something to them they will love it everytime. I play pee-po with my daughter who is 8 months and row row row your boat when i sit her on my lap and rock her back and forwards and she loves it. She has some of those little fabric books which she loves too. And for some reason she loves being held above my head, she laughs when anyone does it, even if she's been crying the second before lol.  I think as long as you make it fun everytime then they will enjoy anything you do. Dance with him, tickle time with him, splash with him in the bath. Happy playing x|`|4YIUxSlYaa	We sing songs.  Getting her to clap her hands to songs whilst I sing.      She loves looking at herself in the mirror.    I pass her toys and get her to pass them back - rolling a ball etc    I try to play games that teach her things like clapping, waving, blowing raspberries etc    She also loves music, so dancing and singing are tops on her list.|`|pDRAciBnaa	holly is 9.5mos old,and when we are home we just go around the house and do a few different things...  -she has a rocking snake she plays on and loves.  -a ride on car.  -playing infront of the mirror.  -playing with safe things out of my make-up,hair drawer.  -i put a few toys away,then rotate every couple of weeks.  -old chocolate tin full of toys(she likes to get them all out and put them back)  -playing on the floor with toys.  -reading books and looking at the 'usbourne touchy feely' books.  -take a walk around the garden.  -singing nursery rhymes.  -back play.  -tummy play.    i bet you do these already,if not hope its helped some :)|`|weA0Xdszaa	My baby is pretty young compared to yours. She's almost 4 months old. But what she likes the best is dancing ;) I hold her in my arms and dance with her, doing the dirty dancing move (you know, when he rises her over his head? lol) or other things. It's a great workout, too hahahaha She always laughs outloud when I do this.   You can also check out this link : http://www.ehow.com/how_6469_play-with-8...   there's plenty of ideas of what to do with a 8 months old :)|`|e9kvxIc3aa	My grandson is 9 months, but loves the tv...I know, and it's not a babysitter, he just loves it...so I sing the songs to him, show him the characters. They have little short term memory, so everything is pretty much new to them each time!
u1ap1Ni2aa	My boyfriend is the same, he would love our 6 year old to do boxing but im not too sure? I think karate or judo is better for the younger ones? I did those when i was young and loved it!|`|HpWujntlaa	Why don't you ask him what he'd like to do? If he doesn't want to box you shouldn't make him box, but if he does want to I say go crazy. There's nothing worse a parent can do than force a child into something they don't enjoy. Definitely ask the child.|`|dd15228a42b4652d8768334912349b61aa	I think that a proper licensed Boxing club is an ideal place for kids to learn discipline and get fit whilst doing so.    My only reservation is his age ~ 5 is, in my opinion, just a little too young as his bone structure is still forming, but with a trustworthy place, they would take this into consideration ~ why not go there and talk to the people in charge and put your mind to rest?|`|YoLa0aE8aa	Yes this will teach him how to stand up for himself.  However he might think he's a little tougher and get a little cocky.|`|jsMhfnRQaa	yes will teach disaplin and stubility, its a form of self defence and in this day and age our children need this.  good luck anything you deside will be best your his mum.|`|jN3pRKkEaa	I think that is a great idea.  Boxing teaches a lot more than just 'boxing'.  It is probably different than you are picturing it.  Anyway you can set up a time to view a class before you enroll him?|`|JvrrRCh6aa	I have been boxing for 6 years since i was 11 now 17 years old. It isnt learning how to fight. Its a sport you really get into if you like it. Challenges you mentally and physically. He wouldnt be put into any matchs anytime soon so you wouldnt have to worry about him being hurt. They usually train year round. Its mostly self defense if it comes to it but they teach you and tell you to not fight.    After a few years of learning your hands are considered legal weapons so it would actually help your child to not fight cause he would be aware of the finer consiquences and really think twice when hes older.|`|GiCCZIVqaa	I don't think that that would be so smart for a 5 year old to do. I would recommend soccer or any other sports. I know my kids love basketball so you could try that but just not boxing. 5 year old's should not be fighting but should be learning how to play on a team. That's is my opinion.|`|0h5hcXEoaa	i think it should be good for him, its a good sport and at least he will be able to stand up for himself in later life, and if it really was that dangerous would they really let 5 year old's do it? they wont do anything to hurt him its a very good skill.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	I personally think boxing is stupid.  look at all the retired/older boxers, you can tell they have had their brains rattled one too many times just by talking to them.i really dont think its a good idea to start your child boxing at 5 years old,,,or at any point in my opinion.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Boxing I wouldn't recommend for a 5 year old. Perhaps karate or jujitsu. These teach about self confidence and how to look after yourself, not to use the Karate unless absolutely needed. I would suggest beavers but I don't know the age. My girls do swimming, treasures (church group) and they have both attended brownies. I am waiting for my eldest to go to guides.|`|yU2WHyvgaa	Boxing can get pretty dangerous. Just be careful he doesn't get too into it and want to persue it because it's a very dangerous sport|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Hi  I do boxng and I think its a great form of defense, Its also very controlled, it will also stop him being a target for bullies. I think he will enjoy it.    I totally agree with Yo, what he says is true. : ]|`|hiRYCT2Haa	It's the most dangerous legal sport in America. Although, he wouldn't box for awhile, it's not safe.     But then again, either is football, baseball, hockey...etc.    Only do boxing if; he likes it, he's too aggressive, or too passive.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	no that's too physical for a 5 year old|`|XadHhxOSaa	ask your son, in the end its his brains that will be bashed out, if hes fine with it then its his fault if he gets hurt. sounds harsh but in the end its down to him.|`|fkZwS2ovaa	Remember Mike Tyson..... nuff said.
bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	A chemical pregnancy is a very very early miscarriage- usually before you even notice youre pregnant.    More than likely though you're just skipping or delaying your period. It happens from time to time.    But if you're truly concerned you can have bloodwork done for HCG levels.|`|yDNv30Okaa	could just be a blip in your cycle,   a chemical pregnancy would give you all the symptoms of being pregnant, and a positive test too, i had one before xmas.  give it another week, and if no period ask for a blood test to make sure everything s ok, and also test for pregnancy, as blood tests are more likley to detect than hcg tests|`|AA11349925	Could judt be a delay in your cycle for some reason, I've not had a period for 2 months now but I'm not pregnant. Don't know why it's not come but the doctor won't investigate until it's delayed by at least 6 months.
7uVlYPEIaa	Some of us don't purposely go above 4, but it happened :). In our case we wanted to complete our family. He had twin boys from a previous marriage, I had my son, we wanted just one more, and we got identical twin girls :). Actually the births per woman is significantly down compared to what it was 20+ years ago. That is why we now have to do our own planning and saving for retirement. Baby Boomers are eating up all the social security plus that we are paying out. So not only am I paying for my own retirement, but I am also paying for someone else's.     Actually there are plenty of houses available, its just people want to live in the little subdivisions on the edge of an urban area instead of in the cities. If the cities would put more money into taking out the trash then more working people would want to come in and reclaim it. I grew up in a rural area and the 800 acre farm my grandparents had when I was a kid the owner decided to put up 20 houses on it. It wasn't because people needed houses. There are plenty of empty houses in the town nearby, it was because farming wasn't paying the bills anymore and people that make good money didn't want to live among the welfare recipients and their drugs anymore. It's not because they are having more kids and need bigger houses. These new houses are actually smaller than the ones in town. The ones in town and the old farm houses tend to be 3 to 4 bedroom, the new ones are only 2 to 3.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Darwinism.  Survival of the fittest.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Most western societies are experiencing a decline in childbearing. (We aren't having a decline in population only because we are living longer.)  The 'average' couple in most first world countries has fewer than 2 children -- not even enough to replace themselves.  And this 'average' includes the small percentage of couples who have 3 or 4 or more kids.  (Most of my daughter's friends/classmates are 'onlies', or have one sibling.)    Massive population growth is occuring primarily in the third world, where reduction in infant/child mortality (by vaccines, better medical care and santitation, etc.) has not been accompanied by reductions in birth rate.  Sadly .... HIV may 'solve' this 'problem' as well in the forseeable future.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I think the number of people dying each day has to be close to the number of babies born each day. You figure that with suicide, car accidents, freak accidents, homicides, natural causes, disease, drownings, and natural disasters, the population is thinning out. No, I don't mean it's not still overpopulated, I just mean that everyone acts like birth is common and death is rare. People die every second all over the world, so it's not like people with large families are just piling on to a population that doesn't see any decrease.     If they can take care of their kids, give them the love and attention they need, people with large families should have that right.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well truthfully I don't think anyone has to justify having as many kids as they want. it's a human right to have children (not all people should but that's not the discussion). Anyway, despite what is wrong with this world no one should have to justify to anyone else why they have x amount of children.|`|ypJt6poOaa	If you are not on welfare, it's fine. If you are on welfare, you are sucking up society's money and are a disgusting f"uck|`|uLQIXyMMaa	Actually there is a shortage of babies as there will not enough wage earner or taxpayers in the years to come to pasy for the ever increasing older population. so there are plenty of couples only having one child or none and therefore not replacing themselves so those who like the larger family are doing their bit to ensure there will be a future population to look after the oldies.|`|6lFyNdcHaa	i think if a family is financial capable of taking care off many children, while being good and loving parents to all of them, why not. i mean, sorry to say, but with a war going on the population is going down any way...all being people and animals should be able to live unjudged.
YomAtJn3aa	It's absolutely okay. Concentrated just means they shipped the juice in a dehydrated form and then rehydrated it at the other end. There's nothing it in that could hurt the fetus.|`|b3CwObBdaa	I drink it & i am 34 weeks.  helps with constipation.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Why wouldn't it be safe?  Apple juice isn't the most nutritious of beverages (just sugar water really, unless it's fortified with additional vitamins), but it isn't going to do the slightest harm to your baby -- just to your hips if you consume too much of it.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Should be fine, I've never been told not to drink it :)|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	of course... why not..=0)|`|3qI1oyFaaa	It's fine. Mostly the only place you'll find any unpasturized juice somewhere selling homemade juices and ciders, like a roadside stand or small country market type place. If it's unpasturized it will say so, but most mainstream companies will definitely pasturize their juice. So anything from concentrate should be fine.    Congrats and good luck!!|`|1IDSGM71aa	Yep apple juice is fine. I got it with WIC when I was pregnant and I practically drank nothing else my 2nd and 3rd trimester because other stuff gave me really bad heartburn for some reason. Enjoy and congrats, you'll be holding your baby before you know it!|`|fPX1lD8uaa	Apple juice is fine to drink.  Enjoy!|`|8YltlMsjaa	Yes, I hav never heard of it hurting the baby      enjoy*|`|Ka52nbhNaa	It is fine to drink!  The used to give it to me at the hospital when I had non-stress tests to get the babies moving in my last trimester.    Best wishes for a happy & healthy pregnancy!|`|UX0Otm6xaa	I don't see why not. I love Martininelli's brand apple juice. It comes in glass bottles shaped like apples. Its the best and always sold out at the grocery store and whole foods. Try it out and I'm sure its safe.|`|9ffa956c569429ec4edaa430974fd5a1aa	never heard anything about it harming a baby
mc6YtaRbaa	Sounds like it could be sciatic nerve pain. At the end of the day, put a heating pad on it and see if that helps. If it is sciatica there's not really much you can do about it. It's your uterus putting pressure on the main nerve in your body.|`|qr8yxOBfaa	It could just be your uterus growing and making room for the baby.  Or it could be that you are over-working yourself and you don't need to do as much as you have been doing.  The next time you go to the doctors' mention it and see what they say.|`|f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	It sounds like a nerve problem.  I can't say for sure.  But it could be a pinched nerve.  I doubt it has anything to do with your pregnancy.  Talk to your doctor about it, if it gets worse, go to the ER. Walking on it a lot or carrying your bag, (if your bag looks like mine, it probably weights just as much too!)  could be a factor in the pinch.  I wonder if the leg is on the same side as your bag??  Don't worry, like i said I'm pretty sure it doesn't have anything to do with your pregnancy.  But certainly go see your doctor!!!!|`|de641317a0696a8d53df9d1538305a2baa	That sounds like you have sciatica, which is actually a back problem that affects one of your legs.  How heavy is your bag?  If you always carry it on one side of your body, that could be the issue.  Remember, pregnancy can exacerbate any medical condition that you may have.  Check with your doctor and good luck.|`|Dr2wwH3jaa	i would relax more and talk to your doc. about it|`|9ffa956c569429ec4edaa430974fd5a1aa	hope everything goes well its early, but it could be just the pain from your muscles relaxing so the baby can grow ,and the extra blood flow and hormones|`|S5v9I0y2aa	Sounds like a nerve is being compressed in your lower back (sciatic pain).  Try to lie on your back and stretch out your bum muscle by gently pulling your knee towards you, and then stretch it towards the outside too.  This might help loosen some of those muscles around your SI joint that could be tight.  But defnitly check with your doctor for other solutions.|`|0527dee9f3d650bd605c9da784d5acb2aa	It sounds like the baby is sitting on a nerve and you have what they call sciatica down your leg,but you better go to your doctor and have them run test or do a sonogram. It can also be a underlying problem you had anyway but pregnancy is aggravating it. I had four births,each one different. The first one was very uncomfortable because of all the stretching and pulling on my pelvis and ribs and I had charlie horses in my legs all the time. It turned out later in life I had a spine arthritis but many first time pregnancies are like this. Also taking Oscal, a calcium suppliment, also helped. My second pregnancy was constant nausea but easy birth. My third one was very painful coming out the birth canal but easy pregnancy and the last was hard because of gestational diabetes. So,each one is different|`|hWc65sEtaa	Sounds like your sciatic nerve.  Try laying on your left side to relieve the pressure of the nerve.  Hope this helps.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	Yup, sounds like Sciatica to me too... Limit your walking (if you do an enormous amount, and how much weight you carry around WHILE your walking) Most DRs reccommend that you not be on your feet for more than 5 hours at a time... When you get this, try finding somewhere to sit... if it happens at home, try laying on your back with 2 -3 pillows under your pelvis... this should cause the baby to "float" up off your sciatic nerve easing the pressure and pain.|`|kdSuwt8paa	Pinched nerve.   Mention it to your doctor on your next visit.|`|AA10230627	if the spot where ur leg goes numb feels warm it could be a blood clot. call ur doctor and see if u can get in to see him or her. i've been thru that before in my second pregnancy. i was put on bed rest and told to elevate my legs to keep the blood flow moving.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi it could be you need to relax more or something more serious i suggest you see your doc. good luck.
YK8P5rNXaa	Yes you should see a doc soon as possible and you should only spot for a day or two that's about it..... I think you are ok if you are just spotting...|`|HPRlEWu1aa	well every woman is different .. some spot for a cpl hrs some spot for 12. some never spot. some will spot a day later .. every body is different. u can always just call an ob office and ask for advice, u dont need insurance for that and it will be a professional answer|`|wFe7L1XJaa	You could be spotting due to a sensitive cervix your doctor may ask you to stop having sex for a while but usually your ok and as far as not having any medical you should be able to go to your nearest community health center and they can help you i just sat in a registration office for 2 hours so i can get prenatal medicaid i hope this helped and Good  Luck!!!|`|fPX1lD8uaa	You should definitely see or talk to your doctor about the spotting, if you don't have insurance, do you have a planned parenthood in your area that you can go to to have them check you out.  You really should see a doctor for your pregnancy.  The sooner the better.|`|S5v9I0y2aa	How far along are you?  It is normal to have a bit of spotting in early pregnancy from implantation.  But if you are already testing positive on a pregnancy test, implantation may not be the culprit.  You could have spotting as part of your pregnancy, which can be okay, but it could also signal a problem.     Spotting after intercourse is normal, but usually it should only last a day or so after intercourse, that's what I think anyways.    Definitly get into a doctor asap to check this out.  All the best!

I can't wait until Jacob gives real hugs...|`|QnJvJ67uaa	awww..its so true :)  whenever we've had a "no you can't" conversation (erm..row :P) about something...a "mummy I hate you!" or "your a mean mum!" or (my personal favourite) "mummy you are a naughty boy!!" is often yelled as they run towards me for a hug...they want to make sure you don't get cross with them...bless their little insecure socks LOL|`|RL3EVSW2aa	they're trying to snap your back and make you wheelchair bound|`|YqoxcTN9aa	reassurance that we still love them, i dont know why it would have to change|`|oIyXMnmcaa	My two do that...lol    I think its because they are young and do not know how to properly handle frustration...normal frustration is relieved by a hug from mom or dad so even if mom and dad made them mad--they still know mom and dad will make them feel better....hmmmm.    I know what you mean about change. Jasper is only 5 and already wiping my kisses away...:(  I guess I still have my hugs...for now. My god, they grow way toooo fast!|`|qSmCA82Aaa	My 16 month old hugs as soon as she knows she did something wrong : )  I'll see her hit her brother and i'll say Arianna and she hugs him real fast!    i love hugs I hope they last forever and ever : )|`|Emc2XOJWaa	My daughter does that.  She'll sit and scream at me and when she's done she'll wait a second then give me a big hug :)  I wish it didn't have to change :(|`|AkFag8tNaa	They don't feel they have control over their feelings and a hug reassures them (wouldn't it be nice if our spouses hugged us instead of pouting in the other room;)|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	children love unconditionally, and no matter what is wrong a hug from mom (or whoever) always makes things better.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	When my Boys are angry I will run over and hug them, and squeeze them till they laugh again.

What can I say, I have the magic touch.|`|A7SJT50Kaa	awww, i'm jealous...my dd1 never hugs when she's mad. she pouts and cries and sometimes throws a tantrum.
ZDQZXhcXaa	hey, if the bleedings the same as it is when u are on ur period then it could possibly be your period, if it doenst last much longer it could be implantation, see how things go today then do a test :)|`|bi4zsE6Uaa	its possible|`|H7cNZYIYaa	well the semen survives for like a week or so, so it's possible to get pregnant by having sex while you're having your period, but no, it's not possible to actually become pregnant during your period.|`|shKc7lZcaa	I got pregnant the last day of my period....  Good luck!!
TQW5E6olaa	Sounds good to me...Just be sure to take the booger sucker from the hospital, they are always better than any kind you can buy.

That's all I can think of!|`|KaAXJJo8aa	Sounds like all you're missing is the baby to come and use it all... lol . Congratz :)    Might want to stock up on more diapers though :) my brother went through a Costco pack a week :-P|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	Things for YOU- cotton comfy underwear, pads, if you're breastfeeding or even if you're not you may want breast pads, lanolin cream|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Sounds good! Idk if this is included in "onsies" but do you have sleepers? The one piece things with feet that zip or button up? Those come in handy a lot.  Also, you may not need this but I kinda liked mine- a bouncy seat? They just kinda chill in there and usually there is a bar of toys they can play with and the seat usually vibrates.   Congratulations!! :)|`|OrKpKxkHaa	Hmmm, dreft, a couple heavier blankets, a bundleme (not necessary but it saved my life!) or a snowsuit, a stroller (i reccomend just the "bones" that your infant carrier hooks into), diaper bag....you seem on top of it! Good luck!|`|rjVALevtaa	You sound very prepared. The only thing I can think of is a boppy pillow. It makes feeding the baby so much easier. You should definitely get one.|`|P25GuvNjaa	Bibs, nail clippers, pramsuit?|`|8XcRFF6Taa	PACIFIERS!  They are always good to have on hand, plus they reduce the risk of SIDS( sudden infant death syndrome).  Oh yeah and breast pads (for leaking) I think you are covered!  Good luck and congratulations:)    This research is straight from the American Academy of Pediatrics.  I'm not sure what you reason is for not wanting to use pacifiers but hopefully this will change your mind.     "Published case-control studies demonstrate a significant reduced risk of SIDS with pacifier use, particularly when placed for sleep. Encouraging pacifier use is likely to be beneficial on a population-wide basis: 1 SIDS death could be prevented for every 2733 (95% CI: 24163334) infants who use a pacifier when placed for sleep (number needed to treat), based on the US SIDS rate and the last-sleep multivariate SOR resulting from this analysis. Therefore, we recommend that pacifiers be offered to infants as a potential method to reduce the risk of SIDS. The pacifier should be offered to the infant when being placed for all sleep episodes, including daytime naps and nighttime sleeps. This is a US Preventive Services Task Force level B strength of recommendation based on the consistency of findings and the likelihood that the beneficial effects will outweigh any potential negative effects. In consideration of potential adverse effects, we recommend pacifier use for infants up to 1 year of age, which includes the peak ages for SIDS risk and the period in which the infant's need for sucking is highest. For breastfed infants, pacifiers should be introduced after breastfeeding has been well established."-PEDIATRICS|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	As a mom of 2 under 2, the only thing that glared out at me was changing pad covers. Especially when they are newborn, you can go through several in a day. I have 6 and sometimes I feel that is not enough! :) You are changing them on that pad, so think about the process and how messy it can be. Another route would be to use the plastic pads you get with your diaper bag and put it onto of your changing pad, but that isnt always 100% effective. A great, inexpensive changing pad cover is the Circo Brand from Target. It comes in green, blue and pink and is a terrycloth fabric (like a towel) It is elastic on all sides for a great fit and retails for 6.99. Invest in 2 more! :)    Bouncer seat?  Bumbo (people will tell you no, but I swear by mine)    You are great on babywearing items! Congratulations and good luck!|`|MQ34YW28aa	holy moly girl you are soo on top of it, lol. To be honest that booger sucker thing doesn't work that great, i just kept my pinky nail a little bit longer and it works great to get the boogers out. The nurse recommended it too. My son (8 weeks) loves his swing so good choice and he also has a vi-berating chair, he used that the day he came home and loves that too. Now that he is in his crib (in our room yet) we got him a fisher price rain forest waterfall peek a boo soother and that puts him to sleep, very neat thing. it's like his little 'tv' lol. otherwise i think you have everything that you  need for now. congrats!! ohh yes i do recommend the boppy pillow that is wonderful for when feeding the baby either breastfeeding or bottle feeding. Also nice for when baby is older to help them sit up too. you may want to get formula and bottles to just incase your milk doesn't come in right away. mine didn't come in until 9 days later.|`|PcQuOmWqaa	You need a bouncy seat that vibrates my son loved it and the vibration lulled him back to sleep.  How about bottles?  Even if you are breast feeding your going to need bottles and a pump.  Do you have the onesies pajamas?  I wish you luck with your new baby.  I would rethink the cloth diapers and go with the disposable ones.|`|e4aF8tdPaa	wow...your good. all you need now is the baby and your str8. :-)|`|s7hEMGpJaa	You need a humidifier during the winter because use of heat will dry out their membranes making it hard for them to breathe. Using it at night when they are asleep is the best idea.    Baby Q-tips are needed as well. What about a breast pump?|`|EL3P7YA4aa	ummm i think u just forgot  to mention bibs....  but you got the basics!!    good job!!
2HXq1569aa	In my house homework is first but I do take into consideration that one of my children is a boy. And sometimes he will need some run around and play time (No video games or computer) right after school for about a 1/2 hour until he can successfully buckle down and do his homework. A snack right after school before hoemwork time is sometimes enough of a break as well.    Also, my son would mess around a lot if I was nearby. So, he would be allowed to do homework at the dining room table but if he started messing around or getting distracted I would send him to his room to do his homework. With the knowledge that if he needs help all his has to do is come out calmy and ask for some help.     To get the 6 year old to do homeowrk faster....For me, the only thing that worked was that they could not do anything else (play,etc) until it was done. After a few times of this they learn to go faster because they do not want to miss out on other things.    If I noticed they were working hard and just needed a little break I would give them a 15 minute break (but no TV, video games, computer, etc). For breaks or anything with a set time, timers work great. I just use my stove one and set it for 15 minutes. That way it's very clear that 15 minutes has passed and its time to get back to homework.     Sending my son to do his homework in his room was the trick that helped my son. For my daughter, I never had too much homework problems with her.     My best suggestion is to try the ideas you have as well as the ideas you get from here or elsewhere until something works. Every kid is different.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	Think of games you can play to get the homework done. Or a reward system. If you are doing something like history or science - is there anything that you learned that really made it interesting? Can you throw in some facts that you learned that might help him remember what he studies and possibly make the subject more exciting?|`|7SKVCPcSaa	you can't rush a kid to do his homework. you need to let him take his time.  but if he is taking too long because he is just goofing around, then maybe a brib is in order! pick out a super cool toy and show it to him. tell him if he does his homework all week/month with out goofing off during the process, that the toy is his.. and only allow one or two days for acting up. every kid has a bad day and needs to get out the frustration. but keep a star chart of the week/month and let him put stars on it for each day he did good but then make him put a frowny face on it for when he was bad. that might help.    if you don't want to spend a lot of money on a toy, perhaps get him some snacks. he may be hungry and not concentrating because of it.|`|fdd19f6be025884e97942d805edfbe1daa	Hard to say... incentives are always a difficult thing to offer, because they place the emphasis on bribery rather than obedience. You could offer him something for days that he starts and finishes his homework before certain times... which also runs the risk of him rushing it.    To be entirely honest, I think you should stick - carefully - with the methods you have, and give it a few weeks, or even months. Once the rhythm is set in, it'll become a habit and you should experience less problems. I'm 21 and I've never found that motivation in myself to do homework in my last 16 years of education - so I'd probably recommend making sure the rhythm is set early on!|`|ihqz4PjOaa	My 6 year old responds better if I sit and do it with him.  Constant praise and high-fives throughout the process helps him along.  But he just loves the fact that I am sitting with him and giving him all my attention.  And I try to make sure we do it ASAP, not wait until just before bed or whatever.  And his homework time never takes more than 20 min...usually less.|`|MYU46ap5aa	My son is also 6.  I reward him with treats or at least 15 minutes of tv time if he does his homework very well.  Try to make homework fun.  My son loves the one on one time.|`|e9kvxIc3aa	How much does he have? My granddaughter has 10 minutes a night..that holds her attention span...I sit with her and do it...|`|YoLa0aE8aa	Yes I helped my sister and i found that time tests and Flash Cards work great! You could also play a tic-tac-toe game where if you get a question right you get to put a X or O and that's also pretty fun. Hope this helps.|`|sIL7H8RBaa	My stepson is six, and we make homework come first when he gets home.  Before he can go outside to play or play in his playroom or anything like that, he has to do his homework and his "chores" (really just feeding the dog and bringing his clothes to the laundry room).  The first week or so, he made it drag out so that he was sitting there for an hour or so to do a paper that should have taken him ten minutes.  But as he learned that he was only missing out on things (ie - by the time he was finished homework and chores it was supper time and then bath time and then almost bedtime), he stepped up the pace and stayed on task.  Sitting there and harping on him to get to work would have just stressed me out - this way he learned it on his own that if he has something he WANTS to do, first he has to do those things that he HAS to do.    Try removing all distractions, too.  That helped for us.  My stepson used to do his homework at the kitchen table and would get distracted by his dog walking by or a delivery guy coming or any other little thing.  Now he has his own little school desk next to mine in my office, and he can focus there because there are only school supplies and his school work - just as if he were in the classroom.    Good Luck!
5bYpbodUaa	Children get sick on an average of 10 times during a year. Are you giving your son a multi vitamin? If not, then perhaps it would benefit  him to do so. I give my four year old "Flinstones Plus Immunity Support".  It's in an orange box and they're chewable.  Don't give him any vitamin that has extra iron, as it will constipate him. I learned that lesson real quick with my son.  :-)  Your son's immune system could be low and therefore contributing to him getting sick more often.  This could be lack of proper nutrition ie: Vitamins, Veggies, Fruits.    My son gets unexplained fevers all the time and I've taken him into the ER a couple of times because of it. The ER doc told me, that as long as I can control the fever, (meaning that I can bring it down), with a luke warm bath, tylenol or motrin, or stripping off his clothes except undies etc., he will be fine. Stripping off the clothes when kids have high fevers will allow the fever to 'escape' and cool off his body.  Fevers are the way of our bodies defense system. Our bodies heat up (with fevers), to burn the bacteria/virus out.    With your son being 5 years of age, his immune system should be stronger than what you are describing, and this is just the mother in me talking. So I'm with you on that.  I would take him to the doc, and tell him that you feel that his immune system is low, and ask if there is a type of test to tell if your child's immune system is working properly. Hopefully there is. Here is a link I found that talks about children's immune system:   http://www.quolkids.com/quol/articles/bu...    I would also have your son's tonsils checked if he still has them. Tonsils can cause us a lot of trouble and make us sick a lot. If it is his tonsils, I recommend having them taken out. It's a 15-20 minute surgical procedure, and about a 3 day stay in the hospital.  I had mine taken out when I was five.  :-)  I also worked as an Anesthesia Tech and saw a lot of Tonsilectomy's.      So, it may not even be his immune system at all. It could be his tonsils. Have both his immune system and tonsils checked.  :-)    Hope this helps.  :-)|`|HpWCjBv6aa	Like you said, something may be wrong with his immune system.  Is he showing any signs or symptoms of diabetes (excessive thirst, excessive urination, etc.), because I was literally sick ALL THE TIME until we figured out that's what it was.    Just take him to his doc and ask what may be wrong.  Explain the frequency of his illnesses and the severity and see what he says.  Call the nurse in the meantime and ask if there's anything you can do for him.|`|7s53MtS3aa	well, when i allow him to drink alcohol quite frequently|`|AA12145826	My daughter is 6 yrs old and in kindergarten as well. It does seem like she's either keeping this cold for a long time or she just keeps getting sick. We even had a round with the week long stomach bug that keeps going around here. There's no harm in getting him checked out. In the mean time, if he's like my daughter, just keep reminding him to use tissues to wipe his nose and to wash his hands (or at least use one of the 3 bottles of hand sanitizer I sent to the school...ugh!!) as often as possible. At this age its hard to get them to do it, all you can do is keep reminding him.|`|1bf2f9586d3ad537a73d55b79612e926aa	My first daughter was sick all the time in kindergarten, she is 22 now and of all my children she is the one who gets sick most often. Right now my 14, 8 and 3 yr old all have really bad colds.And just a side note, this is the first time my 14 yr old has ever been on a antibiotic she rarely gets sick ( has missed 2 days of school in 8 yrs). hear is the kicker.. she was the only one NOT breastfed..go figure.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	That's funny what you said about being breastfed.  My oldest was not and is sick quite a bit.  My youngest was and has only been sick once- and even that was minor.  I've always wondered if there really was a link there.  To answer your question, my oldest is 4 and gets sick, on average, 2 times during the winter.  It was much more when he was younger.  In addition to that- he has very bad allergies and mild asthma so during allergy season, the dry cough and other allergy symptoms appear and then seem to linger.  I hope he feels better soon!!!|`|EtCRnDJMaa	maybe once a year, if that even.  They used to get a high fever that would last about week, but since I started getting their flu shot every year they don't get them.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Both my kids (9 and 4) were breastfed but only my oldest has an amazing immune system. He gets sick about once a year and it's gone within 24 hours but my 4 year old has asthma so a common cold can be a respiratory issue within a day.|`|j2mRop0laa	Last year when my daughter was in Kindy she got sick so often, I was in constant panic mode. She had went to preschool but it didn't prepare for me everything she would catch in grade school.  Ear infections, strep, flu, colds, viruses, unidentified rashes etc.  She basically stayed sick till Sept. to May.   Get him a check up, but don't surprised when this is not the last of it this year.   I hope he feels better!|`|r07BwhO1aa	Honestly my daughter has only been sick a handful of times mainly tonsillitis which she gets every year or every other year.   She is now in the 3rd grade. I did not breast feed although I wanted too the little booger did not take, so I guess I just got really really lucky.
Qfq4lpe7aa	Your breast do get sore in the first weeks but you get used to it...I didn't get sore until I got home though...and I don't think you will jerk him away...This is how you plan to feed him you will want to feed him and for me it was a very rewarding feeling and I felt so close to my son!  I hope that everything goes just as well this time around for me! But you can get lanolin that will help keep your breast moisturized and it doesn't hurt the baby...It will be uncomfortable though because the baby is sucking hard on you but it DOES get better within a week!  Just relax and let the baby do what he knows to do :)  Good luck and congrats!!!      EDIT: the first milk that your baby gets is not really milk it is colostrum that your body has made...Your actual milk my not come in for 2-5 days after you had the baby I was in the hospital for 4 days and mine came in as soon as I got home...so don't worry your baby will be getting what he needs just continue to let him suck because that helps your milk to come in!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	It does hurt, I won't pretend it doesn't. The first few days are particularly hard - because both you and buba are learning how to do it, so to speak. Be prepared and buy a good nipple cream (Lansinoh is a godsend for me), as you will need one. But please don't worry, because it DOES get better. Breastfeeding is very natural, and there is SO much help available for mummys who breastfeed, so if you're ever worried please just ask :)|`|i8Ch743Laa	I only did it for a day,as I wasn't producing enough. It gets really really painful at first. Your breast will be raw,and sore. That's all I really know...I'm sorry I don't have more info to offer,I just didn't continue it,because I didn't have enough milk to do so.|`|vue9NOhYaa	It will not hurt.  When you first put baby to the breast, the nurses will help you. They will show you how to hold him, and how to latch him.  It may feel a bit odd, but you'll be tired and excited and having a thousand other emotions (this will be just a few minutes after baby is born!)  so worrying about how nursing feels will be the furthest thing from your mind.      If there IS some soreness, it won't start until a day or two later, when any less-than-perfect latch (or just the 'unaccustomed' usage of your nipples...)  would have a chance to cause some soreness.  Usually, by that point, you'll be pretty comfortable with the process, and a little soreness won't bother you.  If it's more than a little, be sure to talk with a lactation consultant, so she can correct any issues that are causing the excessive soreness.     I'd strongly urge you to read some books about breastfeeding, and maybe go to a LaLeche League meeting or take a class if available.  While breastfeeding is 'natural' it's not something that most of us are used to seeing or doing, so educating yourself about the process is really important. (Most women who 'fail' do so because they lack the necessary knowlege and/or support.)|`|wl7tlYOYaa	it hurts depending on how much milk u have coming in...if u have alot it wont hurt because the baby will get enough even pulling gently, but if u dont have much he/she is gonna suck harder so that may be a lil uncomfortable. I found the easiest way for me to breast feed was to lay on my side with my daguhter next to me and let her suck away while I was resting she was comfy and so was I except she only wanted to drink from one boob lol good luck and dont worry u will do fine.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I breastfed my son til he was 3 months old. Personally it was a great experience. It creates such a bond between you and your child.     There is some initial pain when you first begin to breastfeed. It last about 2-3 weeks. It's just a little sorness and cracking until your breast become calus enough to where you don't feel it. Luckily for breastfeeding mom there are creams and patchs that help this to be a less painful thing.    Besides a little soreness at first, I would def. say there are no other cons to breastfeeding but here are some of the pros from personal experience:    *Great bond with your baby  *You loose your baby fat a lot quicker  *It's a lot heathier for your baby than formula  *Your baby has a lot less of a chance of getting sick while breastfeeding because they get all of you anitbodies in the breast milk  *You don't have to warm and prepare a bottle during those middle of the nightime feedings  *You reduce your chance of breast cancer    So all that being said I hope I've helped you to decide what you want to do. If you have any other questions please feel free to contact me.|`|MDGRFBoRaa	It does hurt a bit, but it isn't too bad. Give it a chance! When your milk comes in, it hurts pretty bad, but the pain will go away, so don't give up! Good luck, it's such a wonderful experience!|`|GjXEoiMbaa	its gonna hurt at first, ur gonna have sore chapped nipples, and ur gonna feel really weird for the first few minutes , but when u see ur baby attached to you, and the bond you will feel with ur baby,omg its the best thing you will ever experience..(next to seeing your baby for the first time, of course)|`|pR4nLjyRaa	It doesn't hurt too bad, for me it kinda 'burned'   At least try it and if you decide its not for you then at least you can say you tried! :)  Its a great experience! :) good luck!|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi i breastfed both my sons and i never wanted to at first but changed my mind and i am very happy i did. its a little strange to get used to at first but you soon do and what a sense of achievement you get! you wont jerk away its the most natural thing ever! also  protects you from breast and ovary cancers and brittle bones later in life. it will preotect your baby from obesity, ear infections, athsma, will have a slightly higher iq also. the advantages are endless and its free. good luck.|`|5UcdeeX8aa	It may hurt at first, be sure that the tongue is underneath when he's sucking and it doesn't really hurt at first it just gets sore the first week when you're getting used to it, but once you desensitize (good word for it now that I think about it) your breasts it is easy and actually breastfeeding feels good for you and baby. It releases some kind of maternal chemical to your brain or something. Trust me, it's a lot easier than dragging *** into the kitchen to make a bottle at night. Oh and you probably won't produce a lot at first. Your baby gets like a tbsp out of each breast every 2 hours at first then your milk comes in in 2 days.|`|rnTNu6MTaa	It is a sacrifice we have to take...it might be painful for some women. I am 36 weeks pregnant and i don't know how my body will respond to breastfeeding but what i can tell you is that i am going to do my best to feed her and i can't wait to see her little face looking at me while i am doing it. I think it is a strong bonding :) Good luck !!!!|`|i4zKc2bhaa	lol go stick a shop vac hose to your nipples. Those kids have got suction like you would not believe. But after the firt few times you never notice it anymore. I found breast feeding very hard. Don't be surprised if you do too. MY daughter just wouldnt latch on and it becomes so frustring. Everyone pumps it up like its the natural second nature type thing and its not for most people and babies. It also helps to be around very supportive people. my MIL kept making feel like i was starving my chils ( I wasnt) and would shove a bottle (of breast milk, but still!) in her mouth everytime i looked away. That make it nearly impossible. Good luck!|`|sBHhnDwaaa	I've been reading The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding to help "prepare" myself. Its a really good book, La Leche League endorses it too.|`|R7w27pAvaa	You should ask one of the nurses at the hospital to help. When my daughter was born it did not hurt right away, it just started to get irritated, and eventually turn to really painful for about the first two weeks. I think we were doing it wrong and eventually found out how to do it correctly on our own, but it would have been nice to not have all the pain and suffering in the beginning. All I can say is keep at it and don't give up. Breastfeeding is best for your baby and its great you want to give your child the best start. I breastfed my daughter until she was two; its also a great way to bond.|`|5O4Lne7Haa	with my first i didnt really want to breast feed because i "thought" eww those are sexually not bottles(lol) but i went to a breast feeding class and my hubby really wanted me to breast fees so i decided to give it a chance. and it did fell a little weird but i still cant get over how amazing ti felt!! i just gave this beautiful thing life and now im feeding her with my own milk. its the best decision i had and now i cant wait to breastfeed this baby!!    it might hurt but it shouldn't hurt to bad (if it does maybe it not being done right) but when your breast fill with milk you will have to feed the baby or pump because it feels like you have a 10lb bag of potatoes in your breast and that does get very uncomfortable:)    good luck, congrats and best wishes|`|Aj0t6ad2aa	the actual act of breastfeeding shouldnt hurt. but right after you give birth and start to nurse you continue to have contractions.  the hardest part about breastfeeding when you 1st start you feel like that is all you get done doing. but after the 6-8 weeks everything evens out and it is smooth sailing. the best part about breastfeeding is u can pull your newborn into bed with u and u fall asleep while they're nursing. (plus a million more benefits.)    good luck|`|u88ypKqfaa	BREAST FEEDING IS GREAT. I DID IT FOR MY 3 GIRLS. I HAVE A NEIGHBOUR WHO IS AN OLDER NURSE AND TOLD ME TO PREPARE MY NIPPLES WELL BEFORE THE BIRTH SO THAT THEY ARE ALREADY GETTING TOUGHER FOR THE WORK AHEAD OF THEM. YOU TWIST THE NIPPLES AND PULL THEM FOR EXAMPLE. ALSO WHEN YOU DO  START TO FEED IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO WASH YOUR NIPPLES BEFORE AND AFTER THE FEEDING SO THEY DON'T CHAP. ALSO IT'S CLEANER FOR YOU BOTH. I AM SURE YOU ARE ALREADY READING UP ON ALL THIS  BUT KNOW THAT THE MORE YOU DRINK , THE MORE YOU WILL HAVE MILK AND THE MORE YOUR BABY DRINKS THE MORE MILK YOU WILL HAVE. THE BONDING YOU WILL HAVE  WILL CARRY YOU THROUGH YOUR LIVES TOGETHER . ALSO KNOW THAT THE LONGER YOU BREASTFEED THE SMALLER YOUR WOMB WILL SHRINK FROM THE CONTRACTIONS THAT SOMETIME WILL OCCUR WHEN YOU ARE FEEDING . YOU WILL LOOK SLIMMER SOONER THAN IF YOU WEREN'T BREASTFEEDING . I ENVY YOU. GOD BLESS AND CONGRTULATIONS.

Take cardboard and cut out the shapes you want then paint on the details.  You can also print pictures and then color them, cut them out, and hang them on the walls.
gm5IE97uaa	it's a little early for him to do that.  My son was about six months when he could sit up assisted, and towards seven months he could do it by himself.  It's okay if he doesnt do it right away.  Just keep working at it and he'll finally get the hang of it.  Six months is still a bit young.|`|I4a8zI1gaa	By about 7 months was when Dylan could sit without having to put pillows all around him.  6 months he wasn't sitting up unassisted without topples either, and although I was worried - it only took a couple weeks before he was sitting like a pro.  Don't worry.  If he doesn't start sitting unassisted, or you  notice he's slouching to one side, or he's just not gaining the strength to sit alone by i'd say 7 months or so, you can possibly talk to his pediatrician.      but no.. stop worrying.. it's fine!|`|4yUUUkAsaa	Don't panic.  I thought my daughter would never sit on her own, then around 7 1/2 months she finally did and now at 8 months she's almost crawling.  You could try a bumbo seat but my daughter didn't like hers.|`|xK6wehG7aa	My son could sit unassisted for several seconds at almost 5 months. Now, he's 6 months and he can sit up for a while. He's early though. i have a friend who has a 7.5 month old that just started sitting up unassisted for a few seconds. Every baby is different and reaches milestones at a different age. Did you just have a 6 month check up? If the doctor didn't seem worried about it, I wouldn't worry either.|`|1dueLOdvaa	My oldest son was 7 1/2 months old before he could sit up unassisted.     I wouldn't worry. If you look on developmental charts 6 months is on the younger side for sitting up. Most babies can do it by 9 months of age.|`|V7Q7SbHfaa	My daughter started sitting up at 51/2 months but she got really good at it at 6 months.  I worry just like you because she is 7 months and isn't crawling yet, but like everyone says all babies do things at their own pace.  If we worry to much we will miss out on the good stuff, so just let him have lots of play time on the floor and just keep helping him.  It will happen before you know it.  Good luck!|`|AA11656721	My children progressed at different ages.  Two of them walked at age 11 months.  One walked at 2 years old because she was sickly.  I never compare my kids with anyone else' progress because each child is different.  One of my children sat by themselves at 8 months old.  Don't worry to much about it, as long as your child is in good health, then they will eventually sit up on their own.|`|5Crovdoaaa	I wouldn't worry about it. Six months is the average age for babies to sit up on their own. Two of my boys sat by 5 months, and one not until 7 months, and they are all physically on the same level. If you have a boppy pillow, just keep that around him until his back muscles get a little stronger.|`|sAAnquoTaa	As you know all babies do things differently. Your little man is crawling at 6months, but not sitting on his own, and my 7month old is sitting on her own and can't quite figure out how to crawl. She's trying, but can't get it. Don't worry, he'll get it.     She was about 5months when she sat on her own, but just recently she was able to sit up on her own instead of us having to always sit her up to sit on her own.|`|e9kvxIc3aa	Don't worry, it will happen...It seems one day they just sit and THERE...alone!
o2YHnKXiaa	My son rolled over both ways at 5 months old and he is 6 months old and just starting to learn how to crawl. Some babies never crawl they just scoot. If she is pulling herself up I think she should be walking? Sounds to me like it's a little of the parent's faults.|`|OKD0il7Iaa	My son rolled over at 5 months and crawled at 6 walked at 9|`|VmNR14T7aa	My little boy is 15 weeks + 5 days old and he rolled over onto his stomache for the first time today :D|`|n3IoftMFaa	Can she walk? Crawl? If she can do that stuff, she may just be spoiled and knows shel'll be picked up. If she can't do anything - there is a serious delay.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	my daughter rolled over one way at 3 months, both ways by 4 months. sat up by herself at 5 months. was crawling by 6 months, standing at 7 months (holding onto furniture) is starting to walk now at 8 months.     12 months is pretty late to not be crawling... sounds like a developmental problem maybe? couldn't hurt to mention this to her parents, especially if it is making your job unnecessarily difficult.|`|iOSEVRPPaa	12 months?  She should be crawling, if not walking!  Sounds like she isn't lazy, but may have a medical or developmental problem.|`|BEkHHkataa	my friend baby started rolling over at four months so we had to really watch her in the bed cause she would roll out the bed  o and she started crawling at 6 or 7 months and she was walking by 9 months|`|6hA0O06xaa	my son rolled over front to back at 5 months, back to front at 7 months, could sit unassisted at 5-6 months, crawled (dragged himself forward with his hands, still on his belly) at 8.5 months and has been cruising and walking holding our hands since 9.5 months old.  Now at 10 months, he still cannot get to a sitting position from his belly, still does not crawl on hands and knees, and cannot pull up to standing on his own...but all he wants to do is walk!  He cries and reaches out for our hands to hold until we let him and then he just walks around the house for an hour at a time!  He much prefers this to his belly dragging.  I don't know if I am spoiling him by helping him stand all the time instead of letting him cry and learn to pull up on his own.  He's always been a bit slower than average, but I bet he'll walk earlier than average since when he does while we're holding his hands, he's practically running already!  I never thought babies could do stuff so out of order (cruising before being able to pull up?)
4YfehneDaa	1. when i got pregnant the first time i used BBT and OPK.  i wasn't a good sleeper so my temps didn't always show ovulation, so i added the OPK and was able to get a better estimate of ovulation.  2. It depends but we usually try to do it everyday, at least every other day.  3. the cycle we got pregnant we BD everyday from cycle day 9 to 14.    I used Fertilityfriend.com to chart i LOVE it, it works great (better if you pay for it, but still works if you don't) it has very helpful info, i learned how to do everything from that site.  the chat rooms are great too, only downside is it requires the membership.|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	This cycle I used BBT, OPK, CM and CP.  But some cycles I do no monitoring of any kind.  We have been ttc for 2.5 years now so some months I just lose interest in it all.  Also months that we were doing treatments with our RE I didn't monitor because the doctor's office was monitoring me.  I usually BD around 5-7 times during/around ovulation.    Here is my chart for this cycle if you want to look  http://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/hone...
f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	I don't have twins, but I have looked after my nephews twins more than enough times to know that it is insanely difficult!  I just wanted to wish you good luck and tell you that you will adjust. You may feel somewhat overwhelmed now, but you can do this and you will do a great job at it too!  Good luck!|`|jCFOJAH4aa	I have 3 month old twin girls, so haven't got to that stage yet. I am also worrying about that already. I would like to know what people will answer though. lol
se3RwEWyaa	Yes, your body shift in temp when the leutinizing hormone is present. If you had clear CM then it is considered your most fertile day. But sometimes the body prepares itself to ovulate and something (stress, changes in hormones etc.) causes a delay in ovulation. The body again tries to ovulate and will see these signs repeat themselves in attempts to ovulate. So important for you to remember, whenever you see fertile CM you BD to increase your chances to conceive. You may have missed this cycle if you already ovulated 2 wks ago and did not BD at least two days prior. You may also want to note the difference btw CM and Sperm mucus after BD and excitable secretions. Hope this helped! Lots of luck and baby dust***|`|ejJD6BBXaa	there is a very big chance u got pregnant . all i can say is good luck|`|0FwVGYEYaa	any time  their is sexual contact,there is a possibility of  pregnancy|`|9ko5WUFkaa	I'm not sure this is what you want to hear - hopefully I've got it wrong - but...    The discharge that is like egg-white - that's your ovulation discharge.  It's all stretchy and slippery, yet clear.  I've always taken that as when I'm ovulating and didn't get pregnant in 8 years.  So I think you may have got your timing mixed up and are in with a shot of being pregnant.  You might be able to get emergency contraception, but effective best within 24 hours and only works up to about 72 hours after unprotected sex.  The longer you leave it the less effective it is.  At 72 hours it's not even 50%.    Try not to stress, I could be wrong and you might not have got pregnant anyway.  Just wait until your next period comes and if it doesn't, then take a test and work out where you go from there.  No point in worrying about something that you don't know has happened yet and you can't change if it has.      Good Luck!!!    Edit:    Sorry, I'm a dill - I read the question from the wrong angle.  This is in the conceving section - Well, take my advice to mean that you may have been ovulating and there's a chance you are pregnant.  And still, GOOD LUCK!|`|1UOCjhs9aa	Yes. Try and wait and take another HPT. Lots of luck|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	you COULD have become, it is always possible. I have a cousin who actually got pregnant on two different occasions during her period.  By the way, if you are not pregnant this time,our Drs. advise on trying to conceive was: Abstain from having sex for 4 to 5 days before ovulation. This gives the male that many days to really build up a large amount of sperm which gives you a greater chance to conceive when you do make love. Buy an ovulation kit so you will know the exact day  that will be best for you to "make your baby".
XPnCeJ29aa	Ha!   Sun? Beach?? SAND??...  JEALOUS?!?

I've had enough of you rubbing it in my face already! Hey, I could still go to the beach myself... if I wanted to trample though tons of snow to go ice skating. Saturday, my husband is going to an ice fishing tournament. Yes, he's crazy. It will maybe get up to 30 degrees by afternoon, but in the morning, it will feel like 10 below zero with the windchill (it is supposed to be windy). But he somehow doesn't mind sitting on ice and waiting for fish to bite. While he is doing that, I think I'm going to take my daughter to the movies. Sunday is Super Bowl day, so we plan to have a few people over to watch it together.    These plans may be null and void if I happen to go into labor, of course.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Hmmm. We're going to the aquarium Saturday and having a not super bowl party Sunday.

Long story short, we found out just a few days ago that when my now fiance and I went on a break 3 yrs ago, he was on vacation, met a girl, ended up getting her pregnant. He never knew, never saw her again. She died about a week ago, (Yes, at just 19.) =( and he is the only one left for the babies, so we are flying them across the state and they are arriving sunday night. This weekend, I'll be buying and cleaning i suspect.  No, I'm not jealous! hah. I'm going to be a mommy =D
A7SJT50Kaa	absolutely! fits them perfectly  Annabelle Rae  Anastasia Carroll    picked their names out very early in the pregnancies and everyone said we would change our minds a million times before the birth. but i loved their names back then and love them still =D|`|AA10811784	Yes I do! I actually love it even more so now than I did when we first chose it!|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I love them. I sometimes sit back and think about the other names I had picked out but can't imagine calling them those names! I think we made the perfect decision for our boys' names :)|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Yes.  I thought long and hard about each one before I gave it.   They are not oddly spelled or easily mispronounced and are as beautiful as my children are.|`|0C6VJ8mqaa	yes, but i wish i had of spelled it differently|`|r07BwhO1aa	Yes and no, her middle name was my original pick for her first name, (It is beautiful I can't say it because it is unique and I don't want people to steal it but I will say that is is a town in Scotland) but my mom did not like it so she suggested Brianna, and because of the hormones I went with it, but now every other little girl is name Brianna!!!     But I can't picture her being anybody else!!  Names are weird like that.|`|iOo9MAxJaa	I don't have children, but I'm already thinking up names.   I wouldn't want to regret any names I gave them :)|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	Yes I do. It fits his personality.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	very much!!|`|5p7gpj36aa	Yup - Jake!  Jacob, I love it!|`|xPgKWIigaa	Hell Yeah!! I havent come across any Ayva's - and it suits her perfectly1!  Zachs i didnt chose but it was in my top 5 choices. I couldnt imagine calling him anything else now!!|`|vQeKxmZyaa	Very much so.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I do indeed!  I love it! Just think its beautiful|`|YqoxcTN9aa	yes, i do love them, they were all named after someone special in life & it has given them something they consider to be special as well|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	I love her name and even before we had her I was also in love with Savannah some times I do wish I would have gone with it but I still love Audrey and it is a very unique name and fits our daughter perfectly.    good luck!!!|`|4TNavgDuaa	I still love her name but it has only been 5 months.  I know I will still like her name later on down the road.|`|Kg5KX432aa	Honestly, at first I wondered if it was the right name for him. But now I love it and can't think of him as any other name :)|`|sVdQSMvJaa	I love it!!  Charlotte Abigail!!    She is named after her father, Charlotte is the female form of Charles and Abigail is hebrew it means "the father's joy."    And she is a total joy!!|`|oIyXMnmcaa	yeah I do. The deal was Mike got to chose if it was a boy and I got to chose if it was a girl. Well, my ultrasound showed a boy and Mike picked the name Jasper--I was a little leary at first but the name grew on me...I love it. :)    I did not know what the gender was when I had Mya...I thought the surprise would be cool this time so I waited and when she was born I already knew it was my choice for her name and I had it picked already.  I had Mya picked since I was about 12 years old. lol  I just love the name. So I have Jasper Alexander and Mya Pauline...no regrets on either name. What a neat question. :)|`|XRzSxgUnaa	Yes I do.  I had Aiden James picked out long before i was even pregnant, so my fiance and i didn't do any research at all!   Then right before I had him I noticed there were a million other babies named Aiden! It became so popular.  (keep in mind that i had this name picked out at least a year before concieving.)   But by that time we were already attached to the name and had gotten used to the idea of our little AJ.     He looks like an Aiden :) one good thing?   Most people spell it Aidan. so yeah. small things...|`|RnM4Rr5oaa	yea|`|UgX5WeGPaa	yes i still like his name but since i'm not with his dad i kick myself for not naming him what i wanted and that i've always wanted and use my last name.    First i wanted to name him Santino then Gianni but his dads last name is Gault and that wouldn't has been as nice as if it was my last name, Fulginiti...    i've thought long and hard about changing Aydens last name, to do it when he's young but alot of people told me its pretty complicated.    ps.. i really don't care about puttin my last name.. what's someone gonna do come to my house and kill me?? LOL naa.  nor will anyone steal my Identity.. believe me, they ain't gettin anywhere with my credit.. hahaha..|`|WiQQUNQLaa	i want 2 points.thanks.|`|08d8e4d52f5338ea25059bf9c2474615aa	I have 4 sons and 2 daughters.

We had two choices picked out and sometimes when I look at her and imagine that we named her something different I'm like "That doesn't sound right..."|`|uj1A73ZGaa	Yes even though I have had people tell us that they hate the names of our three girls and say how could you name them those awful names.     We love our girls names and they all have a meaning to us. Our girls names are Aaliyah-Mae Morgan, Harli-Lyn Makena, and Jordyn Isabella.|`|p07RwZK2aa	Yes, I gave my kids names that I had always liked so I new that I wouldn't go off them.   They were unique, not too fashionable yet not too weird.   My girls are called:   Lily Claire  April Vivienne   Isla Sienna     I love all the first names, and Vivienne was my mum's name. She died when I was 10 so I obviously have strong connections with that name.     My son is called:   Tobias Max    I loved this name too!   And I still do!!!     x|`|BWUSuNODaa	yes all four of my childrens names suit them and i think they are still perfect choices|`|lM11f486aa	I love my daughter's name but my son is 7 months and I stil have not connected the name with him.

Thomas (after my dad) and Kylie (after need i say lol)|`|Aj0t6ad2aa	i do however when i named my daughter 3 1/2 years ago her name was not popular at all, now i am starting to see more kids with that name and it sux because that was one of the reason i picked it out it wasnt too common.    but i love my kids names  9 y/o step daughter    payton elisse  3 1/2 y/o daughter      avery grace  9 1/2 month old son    cooper michael (michael is after my late brother)|`|v070sAApaa	i love it|`|iSJFWFFkaa	i love my children's names.  they fit them well.|`|Emc2XOJWaa	Yep :)  I didn't like it at first, but it meant alot to my husband so I agreed and now I love the name|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Yes, so far I still do.  There are other names I like and I have often thought "gee, I should have named him..." but then he does something silly, or gives me a certain look and I realize that he IS Jaxon.  His name completely suits him.  Of course this is only because that is the name we chose (ok, I chose) and we have been using it all this time!      I think that the only way I will be talked into more children is if I come up with a name that I just have to use! =)|`|r9gBoBLCaa	I didn't name any of my kids.

I have always been against 'common' names and never once heard the name Aidan until after he was born.  Now, I hear it alllll the time.  Oh well, so much for that one, LOL!  I figured we already have one common name, what's another one (Connor- since the names fit so well together).    ETA: Monica... I have an AJ too, lol (Joseph)|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i love the names I gave my children.  I loved them when we picked them out and i still do.
CJbZw69haa	He needs to hire additional help. Life happens, yeah you chose to have a baby and you have every right to have a child and at the same time be safe at work. Your boss is being insensitive. I'm more than sure that if he has a wife and she was pregnant he would not want her out in this ice storm nor would he want her walking down the icy sidewalk at the risk of falling.  You should get some kind of documentation from your doctor to prove to him that you are having a difficult pregnancy so he can consider hiring more help. I agree with you and feel you have every right to be fed up especially since you have work for him for 3 years without complaints. I too am dealing with the ice storm right now and I walked down my sidewalk yesterday and fell even though I was wearing proper snow boots.  I think it is time to sit down and have a talk with your boss...Good luck with your pregnancy :)|`|wENdWT5kaa	I'm going to some what agree with Am I Blu.     I understand you wanting to keep your baby safe. I've been pregnant twice and did everything in my power to keep them safe and healthy.  And it's great that you did bring it to your boss' attention. BUT you shouldn't expect him to agree and work around your pregnancy. If he doesn't want to hire someone else, he doesn't have to. That is his choice.  I mean, you are pregnant, not disable.     If he won't budge, then i agree with the other use that suggested getting a doctors note. If that doesn't work, then you are going to have to think long and hard about it and either take an early mat. leave or quit.     Just to add, i know in ontario canada, i could have filed for sick/disability  leave if i wanted to.  So depending on where you live, maybe you can take a sick/disability leave due to your HBP.    My intention wasn't to be rude, so if it does come across that i am, then apologies. It isn't meant to be.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	U should speak to him about it. Tell him that he knows ur pregnant and u wouldnt want to slip outside and have that hurt the baby...u have rights he cant just act like that because u decided to get pregnant we have laws that protect us. Speak to him about it if it doesnt work then consult someone with knowledge on the subject. He could at least hire someone to do the running around.|`|ee70635f83473518cde2e7cf3b8004d4aa	You were hired to do a job.  If you are unable to do that job, then you should quit.  You chose to become pregnant and if you are mostly concerned about your health, then quit.  Your boss has every right to expect that you will still carry out your duties.  Why should he go to the expense of hiring extra staff just because you chose to have another baby?    Sorry, but I'm on your boss' side.|`|dPULl5hjaa	You have a  1 piece of crap employer.  He won't change and don't expect him,    I've had more than I can shake a stick at with pathetic employers.    I agree, safety is  1 for you & your baby.  I wouldn't have gone either considering the weather conditions.  It's very icy/snowing here in PA.    Well, you have to decide - do I quit and find another job after delivery or stay and put up with his crap.  I don't know your money situation - maybe you have to work.    Best of luck to you!  Congrats!|`|z1YM1Xniaa	I would tell him how you feel in reasonable manner, professional I should say. I wouldn't raise hell about it because that just makes you look immature. In this kind of weather ANYONE should only be going out if they absolutely have to. It is not safe anybody. Be safe, do not go. If he gets mad he will just have to get over it. Congrats on baby  3 and I hope you have a healthy little one in 5 months!|`|azrKKNfTaa	just tell him that and hope he is not a jerk and if he gets mad and fires you for it you can sue him for wrongful discharge. it sucks but hpefully he will relise that you dont need to be outside right now  good luck|`|rXMSK2B6aa	I would remind your boss that you are pregnant and that you can't risk falling when the sidewalks are not clear for walking.  I think that your health and the health of your baby is what is most important and your boss really has to learn to understand that.|`|9ffa956c569429ec4edaa430974fd5a1aa	Maybe you should get your doctor to write you a letter to your job putting you on light duty ,good luck
7bc597034795bea4dbbecfea92484579aa	Seems like I used to buy 2 big cans each payday; which is every other week for us.  Don't really remember how much either kid was eating at the time though.|`|hdzlWALdaa	i buy 1 tin of SMA (900grms) n it lasts me a week (n costs me 12euros).. i wish i kept breastfeeding! i cant tell u exactly but u can work it out roughly.. lets say i tin (25oz) n with 4oz feeds will last for just over 6 feeds. there must be bigger tins surely or u just got it wrong|`|1IDSGM71aa	Probably around a month, maybe a little bit longer, maybe a little bit less.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	5 or 6 weeks maybe.
vVTmJjJDaa	i'd read that moms with heavier and/or larger babies, especially boys, tend to suffer from such problems due to carrying the child around....    i believe this is true because i had one BIG baby - and suffered similar problems as a result - however, once he was able to walk, all of my symptoms disappeared....therefore, this could possibly be true for you as well.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Vaginal delivery wth forceps isn't going to make you feel like that. And you would be totally clear of any anathesia they gave you.  You are just tired, your baby is probably keeping you up at night, you are just drained.  You need a break, get grandma or grandpa, cousin somebody to let you get some rest during the day.    See if rest and some healthy food doesn't help you regain your strength it may be a mental tiredness that can effect you physically.|`|54f89f63b29123e8efe33f4bdc6a2d74aa	Have they checked to see if you have a pinched nerve in your back?    My son was also 2.5 kg (5 lbs 6 oz) at birth, and man is he one heavy guy now. My back aches constantly and has done for about a year now. Some days when I pick him up I feel like I have a sudden 'numbness' in my legs - my legs just become very weak. Is that how you feel?    Take a nice long, warm bath at the end of the day and go to the doctor for advice. I had back problems before I had my son, so for me it's pretty expected. On the days my legs just won't carry me anymore, I already know it's a pinched nerve.    The doctor can refer you to physical therapist who'll show you easy and quick exercises that will help your back.|`|0FwVGYEYaa	it may be post partum depression  insist the doctor  check you for that|`|R9mQNOCnaa	What does your doctor say?This doesn't sound right.Your legs should not feel like that.There could be pressure on your spine.I don't see why you shouldn't be steady on your feet.Your back and arms may be tired from carrying  a baby but they shouldn't be sore.If your doctor doesn't help I'd see a neurologist.Good luck but find out.|`|O6uxP6GQaa	How long ago did you have your baby??    You could check out www.bumpsandbeyond.friendhood.net and the mums there could have some great advice for you. Its a great place to meet new mums, mums to be and TTC. So come on over and say hello and i'm sure there will be someone there that can help out    Luv Sair  www.bumpsandbeyond.friendhood.net
udch2v5gaa	Take him to the doctor.|`|CVQa88Ujaa	Hello my baby did that when he was 4 months and I was concerned also but as long as your baby is eating then there isn't a problem when you baby starting throwing up excessively then you need to worry because he/she isn't holding down their feedings and that can result in loss of weight.  Good luck to you|`|TqOdbhNAaa	Is his total intake of formula less than it normally is or is it just the amount at one time?  If he's taking less formula daily, then you should call your doctor.  If he's still taking the same amount but in lesser doses, then he's probably just going through a growth spurt or teething.  It could be any number of reasons.  I would recommend talking to your doctor, if only to reassure yourself.|`|GBHVkElWaa	I wouldn't worry unless the baby is losing alot of weight or isn't gaining. They go through that. Then they have a growth spurt and start eating more again.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	take him to the doctor right away
XooW91hWaa	Cradle, bassinet, or crib: If you choose to have your baby sleep in your room at night, a cradle or bassinet is a nice option for the first few months. When the baby gets bigger, you will need to get a crib. When choosing a crib, make sure it meets the latest safety standards and that there are no more than 2 3/8 inches between the slats.   Crib mattress: Unfortunately, most cribs do not come with mattresses so you will need to purchase one. Pick out a mattress that has good back support, is not too soft, and meets all the fire-retardant regulations. Diaper Time: What You Need for the Changing Table  Diapers (plan on using 70-90 per week for the first six weeks, then 50 per week)   Disposable diaper wipes (alcohol-free)   Diaper rash ointment or cream (such as Desitin or A&D)   Rubbing alcohol to wipe around base of umbilical cord   Cotton swabs to apply rubbing alcohol   Petroleum jelly to apply on circumcision (so the baby's penis doesn't stick to the diaper)   Pad for baby to lie on during changing   Diaper pail to dispose of soiled diapers   Layette: Baby's First Clothes  6 undershirts that snap on the bottom or tie on the side, commonly called "onesies" (3 in three-month size and 3 in six-month size)   3-4 infant gowns with elastic bottoms or draw strings. These make for easy diaper changes. All you have to do is pull the gown up over the belly to change the diaper and then pull it back down when finished. There is no stumbling around trying to snap the gown back together, which is especially nice when it's 3 am and all you want to do is get baby back to sleep so that you can get back to sleep.   6 sleepers/stretch suits (3 newborn to three-month size and 3 in six-month size). These are nice to put baby in during the day, but are not essential items. When buying these, make sure you get the kind that zip up the front. These are easier to get baby in and out.   3-4 pairs of booties or socks with stretch elastic band at cuff   3-4 receiving blankets   1 blanket to cover swaddled baby in crib   1 sweater and hat   Bathing Baby: What You Need  Baby bathtub (sloping with foam pad or flat with molded sponge insert)   4 terry cloth bath towels (hooded towels are OK, but not necessary)   4-6 washcloths   Tearless shampoo   Baby soap. Many brands make baby shampoo and soap all in one.   Brush and comb   Rounded-tip nail scissors or clippers. Baby's nails grow quickly and can scratch his or her face.   Bulb syringe nasal aspirator. These are used to suction excess mucus from baby's nose and mouth (the one you receive in the hospital is a keeper!)   You may want to check with your baby's doctor before the first bath. Some doctors recommend that you wait until the umbilical cord has fallen off and the circumcision site has healed before giving your baby a tub bath. In the meantime sponge baths work great.  12 nipples and covers   1 bottle and nipple brush for cleaning   Dishwasher basket for bottles and nipples (optional, but makes for easy cleaning)   Infant formula and measuring cup (if you are not breastfeeding). Use the brand recommended by your child's doctor.   12 Burp cloths   6 Bibs   12 bottles. Even if you are breastfeeding, you should have bottles to use for pumped breast milk.    The Diaper Bag  When buying a diaper bag, pick one that has lots of pockets and places to store individual items. Also, keep in mind that your diaper bag often becomes your purse, so find one large enough to keep your wallet, keys, glasses, cell phone, and other items you need for yourself.    It's a good idea to keep this bag packed with the following items at all times so if you need to leave the house in a hurry (especially if you have to take baby to the doctor unexpectedly), you'll be ready:    5-6 diapers   Disposable wipes   Diaper rash cream or ointment   Pad to lie your baby on top of when changing the diaper   Plastic bags to wrap dirty diapers in until you can find a trashcan to throw them out   Change of clothes for baby: Infant onesies, a pair of socks, hat, baby outfit.   Blanket   2 clean bottles and powdered formula (if bottle feeding)   Burp cloth   Pacifier (if using)   Baby toy or rattle   Sunscreen for babies older than 6 months.   Baby Tylenol   Other Baby Essentials  Newborn-size pacifier: Many lactation consultants recommend not using a pacifier if you are breastfeeding to prevent nipple confusion in your baby.   Infant car seat: This can also be used as a baby carrier. And you can find stroller frames that the infant car seat can snap into so that you don't have to carry the car seat at all times, which can get heavy. If you decide to get a stroller that your infant car seat can snap in to, make sure you get one that fits your infant carrier.   Breast pump for breastfeeding moms: Breast pumps allow you to pump milk so that someone else can feed your baby. This is important if you need to leave your baby for a significant amount of time (for example, if you are working). Breast pumps also come in handy w|`|mobG2SVZaa	the 1st thing is sexual intercourse|`|mjTmQzvFaa	A baby tub.

XOtHsTo0aa	The Aveeno baby products are great.  One of my twins has eczema and has had it since he was a baby.  It gets better then during the winter it gets worse.  He has not had it on his face since he was a baby.   When he was a baby we tried so many different things and really not much worked for it.   Now, when he has it he will get it on his elbows and behind his ears, knees and on his ankles.  He uses the Cetaphil cleaser on his body and uses the Aveeno lotion.    He has asthma, allergie and eczema.  They say that those 3 things usually always happen together.|`|n3IoftMFaa	First off - Oh my God - that is a cute baby!    OK, then, how often do you bathe him? You don't want to strip away his natural protective oils. You can bathe him every 3 days and he will be fine (babies don't get dirty like adults do and they need that oil on them even if they don't have eczema).     You can try Bag Balm it is was and is used to treat cracked and infected cow udders (gross) but it is used by humans too. It is really powerful and great as it is a disinfectant too.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_Balm|`|Ic1u6INRaa	I've had excema all my life.  for him, u should try Aveeno Baby Lotion for Dry Skin, Even Excema.  that may not be the exact name, but thats really close... especially the "even for excema" part.  look in walmart.  i use it and its reeally good even tho i'm grown!|`|TqOdbhNAaa	First of all, my brother has really bad eczema and has since high school (he's 27 now).  I have super dry skin but it's never been really bad.  My daughter, who is 6 months, also has dry skin and has had really bad cradle cap behind her ears, on her forehead and all over her scalp.  My doctor gave us cortisone which seems to help but I have found that the Aveeno products for babies really help a lot more.  I put Aveeno lotion on her face and behind her ears and it'll clear up the outbreaks right away.  I do use the prescription stuff but not as often.  The Aveeno shampoo and wash helps her scalp a lot and I love using it!  I'm hoping that she grows out of it but I have a feeling she's going to fight dry skin like I've had to do, so I'll keep using these products for her.|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	i know exactly what you are going through my daughter started with eczema at 9 months and she is now 16 and still has it. she was hospitalised quite a lot they usually use a steroid cream and wet wraps which are bandages soaked in soft liquid paraffin. sometimes cutting out dairy products can help but i have tried all sorts over the years.they told me it would go at 7 or 14 or when she reached puberty but it never.use scratch mits to stop him scratching because it can get infected bathe him in oils twice a day and apply creams and moisturisers.the skin clinic will advise you better but i have 16 years experience.also when your baby's skin is bad its like being burnt it damages his skin and their Internal thermometer wont work properly they lose body heat through the skin so even if it boiling hot your son could be cold. use the creams try to control the itching once its under control its good but flare ups are very upsetting for both you and your son.and some do grow out of it i hope he is one of the lucky ones good luck.|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	My daughter has had eczema since birth. She is now 2. She bathes in Oilatum, which we use for every bath. Her eczema flares up after a swimming lesson, and even when she doesn't present symptoms I still use the Oilatum, this helps to prevent the flare ups after her swimming lessons.  When she was a baby, I would only bath her once a week (more if necessary). This was so that her natural skin oils weren't stripped away.  In some cases, the child will grow out of it, my daughters has lessened over time. The trigger for my daughters eczema, was that I have eczema, so wasn't surprised when she started showing symptoms.|`|ZHyYVo9Naa	Please go to a natural doctor.  The products you use need to be completely natural with no chems.  It will probably go away but it could be something he is eating.  Doctors are just 'practicing' medicine and don't always have the best answers. Going to a skin specialist is only working on the outside of the problem... not the source of why it may have happened.|`|6hA0O06xaa	My son got little round patches of eczema on his chest and shoulders starting around 8 months old.  He now also gets it on his chin near the corners of his mouth.  Our doctor advised us to only use soap a couple times a week in the bath and if we bat hhim more, just use water.  Also we slather him with tons of lotion (Aveeno baby lotion does work great!) before bed (after bath) and before dressing him in the morning.  And we then use a 1% hydrocortisone cream on any red/inflamed patches.  Usually the patches go away in a few days with this treatment.  But as new ones appear, I think he's just going to have dry skin for his whole life.  My husband gets eczema too (mildly) and the doctor said it's common and there is a genetic factor.  Just make sure your son has so much lotion on him that he is greasy to the touch!  Since my sons eczema appeared gradually, we never figured out what the cause was.  He eats dairy just about every day, and doesn't always have red patches so I don't think that's the issue.

iZDsMCghaa	My own view on this aside, I strongly feel this should be ion agreement between spouses. Its a major decision. Not whether the child wears pink or yellow.  He dosnt want to read the material because he already has strong views of his own and he its sounds very much to me that he dosnt want an argument about it, especially since he cant win. Your both feeling strong about your own views but him saying"no, honey, I really believe this is right" only leaves you pressing your point harder. Maybe Im wrong, Im not there but this is how it sounds, so for him, its easier to hand the decision over to you.  I hope,though, that with this touchy subject you are well educated as well. Pamphlets often talk about one side of things, not the whole picture and its quite possible that your husband has the better idea, or maybe both ideas are acceptable. Possibly agree on the vaccines that are defiantly of upmost importance, like the ones that prevent issues that people used to die or suffer from and now no longer do.|`|SDjrojZXaa	oh men can be so stubborn! Well I think it would be important for your husband and you to be on the same page as far as him be as educated on the subject as you but if he wont read it then i think or now i would agree to disagree until the appointment and tell the doctor your concerns and let him talk with you and your husband so your husband would kind of be forced to listen to all the facts...if the doctor does not address what you have read bring it up.. i wish you luck with whatever you decide on|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Disagreeing on such a big issue involving how to rear your child/ren is very dangerous to the health of your marriage.  Suggest seeing a marriage counselor or therapist to work through this issue in a safe/healthy way.  You really don't want to go against your husband, only for the unthinkable to happen and have your husband resent you.  It can tear a family apart.  This is a big deal that can't be taken back.  Wherever anyone stands on vaccines, there are risks to getting and risks to not getting them.  You need to come together and resolve this issue, because it could blow up on you in the future.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I can only give you my opinion and it is simply that please take it for what it is worth...    All children should be immunized. It protects the child and also the children that they come in contact with. I personally believe it is safer for the general population. That is my "opinion" and I can back it up with facts, but that being said, unless he can give you a viable reason as to why he disagrees, then really he should not be arguing it.  You both deserve to be part of the decision making process and making logical concise decisions regarding your children.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	If he trusts your judgment, then there is no argument - you just go forward with what you think is best.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	don't feel bad I think a lot of dad's tend to be that way. my husband and I had many disagreements on things when it came to our daughter. I of course would get online and do a ton of research so that I could make an educated decision but when I presented the material to my husband he didn't want to see it. he thought I was undermining him! guys are just like that|`|ZlYmbAVQaa	I think you are right and he doesn't have an answer if he doesn't have a reason|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	men are very hard headed, my husband wont decuse cloth diapering, so i understand! but you do have to descus this wiht him as its both of your child. there are serious side effects to not getting your child   vaccinationas. so maybe you both should go talk with the childs docotor so you both get a good view of the goods and bads of vaccinations.|`|HhmhSBpgaa	you could both talk to the doctor and let him explain pros and cons.|`|JjBtgSixaa	Maybe he just wants you to make that decision without him, he might be ok with what you said.
UX0Otm6xaa	Its different for every state, but basically it means you have 3 days after birth to drop off your unwanted baby at a hospital, police station or fire station without getting in any trouble or even giving your name. You have to physically hand the baby to someone though, not just ring the bell and run so to speak. One woman did that earlier this winter and the baby froze to death outside a hospital door.     I believe its a good idea, but there really needs to be more education on the PROPER ways to do it.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	They allow you to drop off a baby at a hospital, police station or fire station within a certain amount of days after birth with no questions asked if you feel that you are not able to care for the baby.  I think it is a great idea because it saves a lot of lives but I believe that too many people are unaware of this law and bad things happen before they have the opportunity to find out that this could have been a simple solution to their problems.|`|xnhwmontaa	That means if a mother does not want her child she can take them to a police station fire station hospital and they can drop off their child in a safe place. Instead of some people putting them in a dumpster. If I could I would make my home a safe haven! poor children|`|AA10645224	DEPENDS ON THE STATE    AND YES THEY ARE|`|rjVALevtaa	The time limit varies from state to state. But basically you can hand over a newborn baby to any hospital, fire station, or police station. Yes, I think it's a great idea.
oDyNiJi7aa	Yes, you do need to keep her on a schedule and stick to it.  A young child should eat every 2 hours.  Example.    7am Breakfast  9am Snack  11am Lunch  12pm nap  2pm snack  4 or 5pm dinner  7pm snack  I hope that this will help you out.  Also I know for my children if they are not active a lot they do have a harder time sleeping for me.  I wish you the best!  8pm bed time|`|tOdjjeAmaa	It may be a phase, but if you went to bed at 7 you'd wake up early too! Dinner at 4 is super early. We do dinner between 5-7 and then bedtime is 8 sharp. She wakes up at 7:30 every morning. Just try a later bedtime! If I had to, like if I were in your situation, I might even wait until 8:30 or 9 before bedtime! Good luck.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Supper at 4?  Wow.  My daughter has her last snack at around half 7, and then bed by half 8, or 9. Sleeps right through till 7|`|dgM66nRBaa	She goes to bed at 7? Wow... I put my daughter to bed at 830 and she still wakes up at 630 and she's 2.5. Try putting her to bed later.|`|AA12123894	What do you expect when you put her to bed at 7? Keep her up a little later.If you can,take her out for some fresh air and exercise.|`|2pvAbIDUaa	get use to it|`|OMOuxROoaa	put her to bed later like around 9ish.|`|1Mq3Vh5oaa	yea if u keep her up a little later and maybe doing something that will help her sleep better like playing till she;s tired or a wii game...boy that gets my niece and nephew soo tired they sleep till i come to get them..lol...but yea try 9
IGfnrfGPaa	35, I want to be able to run around with my kids and I want to enjoy my golden years with out having young kids to take care of.|`|AA10167940	33, and even that's pushing it.      I don't see why any woman would want to risk her baby's health or hers by having children beyond the age of 35.  I guess it's selfishness-|`|M6c0hUefaa	Probably 35, BUT...I really want to be done having children by 30 just so I can look forward to having them out of the house at least by the time I'm 50..|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I am almost certainly not going to, but I think I would be comfortable trying until I was 40.    Edited:  I do have to laugh a bit at some of these answers.  I didn't even meet my husband until I was in my 30's!|`|xK6wehG7aa	I think 31 would be my limit. Only because I had my first child at  21 and I wouldn't want there to be such a huge age gap between my children.|`|XOtHsTo0aa	I had my daughter 4 months ago and I am almost 34.  I don't see us having anymore.  I definitely don't have the energy with my daughter than I had with my twins 10 years ago.  So, I guess I would have to say 34-35. After 35 there are elevated risks for genetic defects such as Downs Syndrome and neural tube defects.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	34, though its gone up since I've gotten older.  If someone is willing to go 35 the 35-37 age group isn't much more of a significant risk.|`|sk46uigvaa	40|`|oojO4WAraa	Around 40.  The risk of downs syndrome goes up after 40.|`|NcufdPaAaa	Age doesn't matter.  As long as your happy,  and are settled down with the person you love and loves you in return.  I'd say anyone older than 18 personally... And younger than 40.|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	35 (:|`|FoY5fgVwaa	No older than 30!  I had my first when I was 20, second when I was 23, and I hope to have another one soon.  I don't want my kids too spaced out.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	probably 33.  I plan to have all my babies in my 20s..  I already had my first son at 22.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	35 probably for me- though i am 21 and my son is almost 2 so i think i'll probably ge them knocked out before then. there are 7 kids in my family and my dad was 40 when my brother was born. he told my step-mom no more after 40- he's 45 now and she's almost 34 so she's much younger|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	probably between 27-30.  i am 22 years old and i have a 4 year old and a 6 week old.  we might not even have anymore children.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	my husband and i would love to have all of our kids by the time we hit 30 (we're only 3 months apart so its not big deal to pick a certain age.) but i think the absolutely latest would be 35.. its just too risky after that.|`|1f7454e7b81f8ce36a73c7aca09a8c24aa	30|`|lKof1n0Xaa	not older than 37. It's proven that the older the mother, the more chance a baby has to be unhealthy physically, mentally at birth including deformities.|`|IhfdkCnjaa	i would impregnate until the end|`|o2YHnKXiaa	Probably around 40 years old.|`|AA11981363	35|`|TqOdbhNAaa	It scares me to think about all of the additional tests they make you take when you're past the age of 35, so I'm not sure!  I'm 30 now with a 6 month old and definitely want 2 more so however it happens, it happens.|`|WirFwirLaa	I would like to be done having kids by the time i'm 32. I'm almost 25 and have a 1 year old son. I plan on trying for  2 when i'm around 28 & my son is 4. If (and thats a HUGE if!) I plan on having a 3rd child I would like to have him/her by the time i'm 32 and if not, oh well, 2 is fine for me! My husband is the one that likes the idea of 3....|`|U8QQkeQ4aa	for me 34...the testing gets more complicated after that age. I am not a fan of giant needles...like the one they use for the amniotesis testing.     Plus I definitely want my husband and I to concentrate on our careers in our mid to late 30's...having another baby just seems like we wouldn't be able to do that the way we want to.      But everybody is different! If you don't care about all the other fluff that i do, I think having a baby as late as 38 is okay. My mother had my youngest brother at 38 and he is just fine...a pain...but I love him anyways :) Him and I  are 8 years apart.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	Personally, I didn't want any kids after 30 - which is why I got my tubes tied after my daughter came last year.|`|AA11656721	I would not suggest going past 35 -40 yrs old.  Because babies are a lot of work and you need a lot of energy to care for them.  Plus when they grow up to teen years, you will be in the 50's and it will be harder to care for a teen.  But if it's unavoidable, then it's okay.  As long as you have some support to help, like a spouse.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	35|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	Probably 35 to 39 but I dunno if my husband would go for that bc he would be in his 60's and our first son then will be just be graduating HS. LOL|`|zhJOZhKEaa	Whenever I hit menopause.    I'm 39 now and I am not calling myself 'done'.  We would like one more and in a couple of years.  I'll not put an upper limit on when I can have a child... God takes care of closing the factory.       The statistical 'risks' go up a teeny tiny bit each day... you do not magically become 35 yrs old and 'need' all this testing.  My last two were born after I was 35 yrs and I refused all the extra tests.  My doc was fine with that.  All my babies have been healthy and I wouldn't give them back if they weren't.|`|LhvKTYftaa	32.    just for us.  I want to be younger when my kids are older.  My mom had me at 33 and I'm the oldest.  She celebrated her 60th birthday the day before my wedding.|`|OuOOy8v3aa	I think the latest i would have a child is 40, so i know i won't be dead of old age before the childs 20th.|`|4Mm7Tau2aa	69|`|JF343E2Taa	40|`|gm5IE97uaa	40|`|NEWbh3Plaa	40, Maybe 45 if I really wanted another baby.|`|5O4Lne7Haa	i think 37 would be the cut of year. older then that there could be alot of health problems and i dont want to be 60 when i send my kid to college.|`|fXzed3fLaa	35|`|XPnCeJ29aa	No later than 30 for me.  But I had my first at 20.|`|Lgo6UX12aa	I'd like to say that I would try up until I was 35 - but if I REALLY wanted another one and it hadn't happened by then - I might try for a few more years.

b3CwObBdaa	I eat and drink what I want.  Asides from the obvious no-no's, which is excessive amounts of caffeine, booze, etc.  The only things that I asked my doc about was herbals (he said no to anything herbal).  I agree, it's pretty common sense.|`|SDjrojZXaa	there are different foods and drinks  that should be avoided or limited while pregnant that is a little tricky to know .,,,,now can i smoke weed yeah thats a dumb one...|`|vue9NOhYaa	Because people are paranoid, or don't understand what concepts like 'unpasturized' or 'raw' mean ... so they panic over eating a pizza because it has cheese on it, or eating a piece of salmon because they've heard that tuna or sushi  may be unsafe.|`|MNja3iwMaa	cos people worry and read pregnancy books and believe everything they read and take it as gospel. though people are always more cautious when its their first child. when you have your second you don't bother with the books and do what you want!|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Not really.   There are lots of things that you eat everyday but can be harmful. CAN BE...not are.   Like sandwich meat.   Soft cheese.   Sushi.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I don't think all things are common sense. Most things yes, like don't eat raw eggs, but would you think that you shouldn't have smoked meat? That would never occur to me but I've read that you should avoid it. It's better to be safe and ask then to eat it and risk harm to your baby. Also, it's what the site was designed for. Most people just want piece of mind and someone else they can talk to who is going through the same thing.|`|tn9sL3Ncaa	no it isn't common sense, and anyway if people knew then they wouldn't be asking i would much rather as then risk loosing or damaging my baby!!|`|JFr7fCiXaa	because theres always different stories in the media saying if you eat something your babies gonna be healthy or if you eat something else its at risk. this just panics pregnant women as they all want the best for there babies|`|eya1WDS4aa	no clue. Their doctors fill them in on what not to eat sooo no clue.|`|dDVAUA9saa	Yes!  And then people ask if it's safe to drive when you're pregnant or drink decaf coffee!!  People are paranoid!!!!|`|b3XSnPXBaa	You know you really shouldn't get so uptight that people want to do whats best for their unborn baby.  So did you never need to ask a single question.  People who haven't been pregnant before do not know all the answers. I only found out monday and I've asked loads, just because I want everything to be perfect for my child.  How is not being able to eat soft cheeses, or certain smoked meats, or only a certain amount of tuna because of the lead content in it 'common sense' !!!  Yes, not drinking vodka every night and smoking is common sense, but not those types of food, if you don't know, you don't know.  That's what Yahoo answers is all about, helping eachother.
fSdSuMHOaa	Try races Skidoo. i had a similar problem when mine was a toddler and races finally worked. i'd change at the same time (dress partially first & then just struggle with a belt or button!) and let him win. Make it fun. i used to even blow a whistle! Madcap Mum that i am.    Also, just check if theres something bothering her about her pyjamas.. waist too tight? too loose? too poky?(!)    All the best!  xx|`|s9haCi64aa	Encourage her to help you by being a big girl and getting dressed herself|`|32e46f5365de97f08e8132dd292b1761aa	She is acting out!  She is saying, 'I don't want you to go to work, I don't want to go to Nursery, I want us to stay at home!'  Of course three-year-olds don't understand the juggling act us mums have do every day to keep the home / work / life balance going!    I would suggest slowing down the night time routine - maybe take her upstairs a bit earlier, lots of hugs and cuddles so she can spend quality time with you.  The mornings are going to be harder, but I used to find sticker charts work well, you can make a chart on the computer and stick it to her wardrobe door or something, then you can get stickers from Smiths and other stationery shops.  Maybe if she gets dressed really well for a week, with a whole row of shiny stickers, then she can have an extra treat.    Hope this helps!|`|1yXqgAhjaa	This may seem weird but I was watching a movie last night kind of about that. If you tell him/her that she "Doesn't have to get dressed. You don't have to get up. You can just sit in a time-out all day. I am sure that your teacher will be mad, and so will I. I am disappointed." Then simply walk away, and wait 10 minutes. Telling someone that they can't do something is really annoying, so they will do the opposite!    -Meggie|`|N3fywkEfaa	Maybe you could try getting out two or three outfits for her and letting her choose from them so she feels she still has a say in it... try make it exciting for her..   Otherwise just persist with the naughty step everyday until it passes.. hopefully it does  Good luck|`|OKD0il7Iaa	When they are being bad try not to pay attention to them. Don't yell or tell them to stop or they'll keep going for the attention. If they don't stop give them one good smack in the butt. Don't worry too much about it though it's just a phase.|`|m4mZMIMjaa	I strongly recomend enforcing a "time out" like program until your daughter is ready to do the task she is supposed to do.     My brother was having difficulty getting his son to put his shoes on.  I told his son that he had to sit in the corner until he was ready to put his shoes on.  He quickly decided that putting the shoes on was a better choice.    In fairness the child was nearly four, instead of nearly thee, but I believe the same principal applies.  If that doesn't work, I would merely get the child dressed despite her protests.  She's only almost three.  She doesn't get to choose whether or not to put her PJs on yet.    Good luck!|`|12Aifvf4aa	If you make an issue out of it your toddler will cotton on.  Try making getting dressed fun not a chore. Say something like, "I wonder how fast we can get your socks/vest/pants on? Or if I cover my eyes and count to.... what will I see, will you have your vest on?  Remember, they are three and do not have the skills to understand what is going on, but they will pick up on atmospheres. If you are in a rush and tense, they will respond.  It may be a struggle for supremacy, your toddler is working out things and learning fast.   I recall my sister taking her daughter to nursery in PJ's (child not sister). The staff were fine about it and the phase did not last long.|`|893687c84192db8afc5ff77206f27a2faa	when i was a preschool teacher i also used to babysit over night for a couple of kids. one of them refused to get dressed one morning (he was 2.5 yrs old) so i told him that he will just have to go to school in his p.j.s and explain to his friends and teachers why he was still in his night night clothes. he got dressed after that.|`|3IXDx9nhaa	Yes I hear you, forget the terrible 2s mine was more difficult at 3 also.  Get it sorted in the afternoon beforehand.  Don't ask her what she want's to wear, instead give her 2 choices.  Praise her when she chooses one and go with it.  Help her choose a hair band etc. to go with the outfit and be excited about it.  Iron it if need be and hang it up in her room ready for the next day so it's there ready before she goes to bed a night.|`|uLQIXyMMaa	When my twins were little they used to choose their own outfits and some of the combinations were bizarre but their own choice.   If you littleun won't get dressed then as someone else says let her go in her pjs, and if she wants to sleep in her clothes so what!     Where i live in Spain you will see grown women tottering down the road to the local supermarket in their pajamas and slippers, in the winter they put on a dressing gown.|`|Z45YUKesaa	Tell her she is a big girl and it is time for her to start help picking out her clothes/pj's. Then lay out 3 different outfits/pj's that you approve of for her to choose from. Then you both are getting your way and she learns how to make choices. This helped me with my son and my daughter:O) I hope this helps. Good luck!|`|2pvAbIDUaa	Lay out different out fits and let her be the one to choose. Even if she mix and matches (and looks like a clown..lol), Your getting her dressed and you won't be late for work.|`|ywI7XxH4aa	Have you tried giving her 2 outfit options so she feels she is being more independent. I think at this age it's all about the Independence and she feels she has no control over what she wears and when she goes to bed.  I hope i've helped as you always give me really good answers : )|`|FO1XCZc4aa	My suggestion is to change her routine around slightly, for example if she has breakfast then telly then dressed, start putting the getting dressed in the middle so the reward comes last and she learns to earn it by cooperation. My friends 3 year old will do anything for Barney and today used the potty for the first time after months of frustration for my friend.  I also agree with 2nd answer, though 3 is maybe a little young to understand.  I have to offer alot of help to my six year old...he can go looking for his socks and come back with the cat he is that easily distracted!|`|2s5WSVbPaa	You need to turn it into a game for example, can you gat your socks on before I count to 10, it's how I get my 4 and 5 yr olds to dress, pick up toys etc, works everytime.|`|HhY4Oul2aa	show who is boss and dont use anger or frustration be calm and polite but be stern when you talk to him|`|r9lfDeRmaa	Have you tired making changing into a game. Like she gets points for each piece of clothing and bonus points for not having a fit. Then at the end of the week she gets something special, like she gets to choose what movie you watch together, or she gets an extra thirty minutes at the park.    Just an idea, I have used this a couple of times with my 4 yr old, sometimes it works and other times it's a dud.    Hope it helps.|`|145RUNQHaa	I m horrified that someone would spank a toddler and send them to their room for an entire day.that is nothing short of evil.call themselves parents?i am absolutely disgusted and i don t half feel for that little boy.                  I agree with giving choices of clothes but that doesn t always work leave plenty of time in the morning and i know it s hard work but time outs for this age don t work and anyway there s no time in the morning for a time out!whatever you do don t turn into a battle of wills or you will both get more frustrated.try giving her an egg timer or something along those lines and say if you can get your clothes on before the time runs out you can have a sticker to show everyone at nursery.i suppose she just needs a bit of motivation.i find if you get the teacher to say something like do you get dressed yourself in the morning?what big girl make sure you get dressed quickly so you don t miss the register and any fun we re having!they listen to teachers i find with my daughter if the teacher said she must try to get to school on time it gets her moving!hope i ve helped!|`|WgyGipBMaa	Well the way I see it is if they are going to act like a baby treat them like one.|`|JbDfdJb8aa	You could always make it worth her while by promising a story at night and play a game with her in the morning or something. Kids respond well to bribery but I think the trick is to offer them something non-material to avoid spoiling.|`|6710b87650d29aedb9ee3b4272d6af96aa	Put her clothes in a bag and take her to nursery in her PJ's. She will soon change her mind about getting dressed and if she doesnt at least you won't be late.|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	Start getting baby ready for bed earlier and don't let this become an issue.  They can feel your tension and will play on this.  Many children go through a phase like this, it's just finding their feet.  Doesn't mean you should sit back and let them though, the behaviour needs dealing with.  Tell her that there is no other choice, that getting dressed is the only option, whether she likes it or not it needs to be done and is going to get done.  Physically make her get dressed and then get on with your day.    Edit: All this "Let's play a game and take two hours about getting dresssed if that's what you want" isn't helping your child prepare for the big bad outside world where their opinion is one of millions and not the only apple of mummy's eye.  Start as you mean to go on, why let your child learn one routine only for it to be unrealsistic in the big picture and them have to re-learn to fit in with the rest of the class at school, for example?  The teacher can't spend half an hour with each child that doesn't want to get dressed after PE....    Probably goes some way to explain why so many children end up in trouble, they're not used to being told "No!" and think they can do whatever they want as mummy has been quite happily running round after them and their every need.  Yes, you should be there, but they are not born knowing right from wrong, it's out job to teach them.  A lot a problems start with the attitude "I'll let them do it for now but stop them once they get to chool", why?  All that does is give the child a warped sense of what is right and at school time, when their lives are going through a major change in routine, then there's the other change of fitting in and complying.|`|kRmuf3gfaa	Well.  Spank her butt and tell her if she does not get dressed she can be grounded to her room.  And if she doesn't get dressed then when you guys get home make her go to her room, no toys or anything, and make her stay in her room the rest of the day and see if she will get dressed the next day.    It worked for Elijah. Well he has no problem getting dressed. Anyways he's almost 3 and he kept peeing his pants, so his dad spanked him and he had to stay in his room all day. The next day he started using the toilet again.|`|5pgVIlLFaa	Well I had a very similar problem with my son. I actually took took him to his pediatrician to see if maybe he had any suggestions. He said to let my son pick out his own clothes, shoes ect... This makes the kiddo feel as if they have some control. I also started singing to him to wake up. Songs like ABC's , twinkle twinkle and so on. It works for me. I don't always wake up in a great mood but well I would do all this  so I wouldn't be late for work. Good LUck

AA10120592	we're thinking maybe our 5 year old might have to go on meds (not too happy about it, but you know how hard it is) but i can tell you if i didn't like even one side effect, i don't care what the doctor says, she'd be off it faster than i can type. Its like the doctor doesn't want to do the work to find a new med that'll be better. and if the first one he was on was fine, why change?  if you don't like it, make the doc change it, as with any meds you were on.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Oh my gosh!!!  Well, I started taking adderall in 9th grade.  I love it and hated it at the same time.

The down side was I couldn't eat anything!  All I could do was drink milk...  I dropped down to 102 lbs, I was 5'5'' so about 10lbs under weight.  30mg was my dosage.  Both of my younger brothers were on it to, 6 and 8.  Honestly, I would never put my kids on this stuff definitely not in elementary or middle school.  Giving a 6yr old an amphetamine just doesn't sound safe to me, who knows what the long term effects are with this junk.     You should look into fish oil and or flax seed oil, supposed to help with ADHD.  He also needs a lot of outside time, everyday, to run around and tire himself out and a routine for bedtime.  Mine for my kids is dinner, bath, teeth, books, bed.  For kids with ADHD a routine is soooooo necessary!  He needs a lot of attention, patience and consistency from both of his parents.      ** I am 23 now and haven't taken any meds for ADHD since I was 18.  I have no problems, I work pt and the rest of my time is spent with my kids.  I did however take adderall before Christmas so I could reorganize my entire house:)  My youngest brother still takes it, he's 17( a little weird not very social even around his family, but maybe thats from all the video games?... I don't know) and my other brother (19) takes it whenever he feels like he needs to.  He is fine, very out going works 2 jobs and plans to go back to school next year.|`|XXZFf1AYaa	My son was thisclose to being diagnosed with ADHD, but I refused to take him in for testing because I think 5 is too young to know for sure. And yes, he would have failed a doctors test. I switched his teacher, I adjusted his schedule, and literally one day he went to school and was great and has been for months. I suggest you try taking him off meds, and that will elimate that issue right there.    And I'm sure I'll get people mad but honestly I don't care, you should rethink giving 5 year olds medications that affect their brain. Doctors do not know everything, we are all students of life.
jN3pRKkEaa	My son did the same thing between 7 - 8 years old.  I could not stand it.  Every day, as soon as we are ready to leave for school he would have an unbearable leg pain, or throat pain, or whatever pain.  Every day when I pick him up from after school care, before he sees me in the room he is playing, smiling having fun...then I get there....the crying about stomach ache or head ache or this pain or that pain begins.  Same thing at bed time.  It got so ridiculous.  He did not do it at school though.    Another thing he would do, you did not mention if your daughter does this - he would have EXTREME reactions to the slightest bit of pain...stubbing his toe would cause him to throw himself on the floor and scream and cry as if he was being killed for about 15 minutes.  Even an itch would make him have such an extreme reaction, any type of pain or discomfort at all.  Sometimes he would scream even for an hour.    It went on for a long time.  I tried everything, being sympathetic, yelling, sending him to his room, talking, etc...nothing stopped.  I was ready to take him to the doctor and told him so.  He was very upset about that and the behavior decreased in severity.      Finally, one day while he was having an all out screaming fit about hurting his toe, I yelled, 'You are not getting any attention from me at all when you hurt yourself.  You are reacting like this for attention and it only makes me angry.  If you want positive attention from me, you cannot act like this'  and then that behavior stopped.  It finally 'clicked' for him.  That solved the extreme reaction part.    Regarding the 'pains' whenever we are leaving or picking up or bed time, same thing.  And I kept telling him how I just will never know when something is really wrong w/ him because of how he always claims something hurts.    The point, is that it eventually stopped but I know how you feel and it was a very trying time at home.|`|gk6hyJOnaa	Try spending time together. Eat meals at a table with no radio or television and dont answer phone calls during meals. Make it YOUR time together.     She might open up and say what the problem is. You have to earn her trust. Quality time together might just make that happen.|`|ZHyYVo9Naa	Ok... I feel bad for her because I did a lot of this when I was little too.  Mostly because I did not have a great school experience.  I would tell her every day how wonderful she looks and that she is completely healthy.  Tell her every time she eats healthy food how much it will keep her healthy and growing up so perfectly.  Honestly, spoken words can be so effective.  Ask her teacher to compliment how good she looks every morning when she gets to school and if your daughter asks to go to the nurse have her teacher tell her that she has to continue what she is doing for 10 minutes before she can go ad then if she still needs to she can.  Maybe ask a local healing room or prayer house to pray with her and give you more answers you might need.    Hope this helps!|`|e9kvxIc3aa	Maybe it's the age....my granddaughter is almost 7, and I think she and the school nurse are on first name basis...she complains all the time as well, and there is nothing wrong!|`|hlq3Eo0haa	she honestly does not like school,normal for all kids at one stage in their life.but sometimes it does not change,my daughter from year 1 to 9 says at least once a week before bed time"i feel sick" make the thermometer your new best friend,but be warned kids can b sneaky, they can take their own temp and put it under hot water,giving a high reading,also they can put their head over a toaster causing them to feel like they have a temp.good luck. also for mums with older kids your little angels can get some frozen vegies and put them in the toilet,make vomiting noises,bingo they scored a day off|`|HpWCjBv6aa	My four year old cousin is the same way, and I have a feeling she does it to get attention (she was also not born premature like your child.)    Ask her how she likes school.  If she shows a lack of interest in school and schoolwork, then I think you'll have found your problem.  She may be doing it to get out of doing things she doesn't want to do (ie: schoolwork, going to bed, etc.)    Of course, there are going to be times when she actually is ill, but those may be few or far between.  Explain to her that unless she is throwing up or has a fever, she must stay in school and get her education.|`|dgM66nRBaa	my daughter 2.5 yrs old will come running up to me for no reason and say, "Mommy hurts" holding her finger up at me. I look at it and there's nothing wrong with it. I give it a kiss anyways and she runs off. about 5 minutes later she comes running back up to me and saying the same thing about her foot. There's nothing there. so I think she's trying to find excuses to get the dog outside, because the dog is always to blame.|`|npkLIKPUaa	She is just finding an excuse to stay home maybe she is avoiding something or someone ever asked her?|`|oEe2Rdifaa	maybe a voiding school ask her teacher and ask her plz so that if she have any problem in school then try to figure and way out. plz be gentle when asking her. be like a friend.|`|HWtG9dkzaa	Its possible that whilst she was ill as a younger child, she thought she was getting more attention then she does when she's well - that she got more presents, more hugs, more kisses, etc, etc.    As a result - she's pretending to be ill to get this attention again.     Try telling her the story of 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf' - and tell her that is she continues to pretend to be ill, when she isn't - people may not believe her when she's actually sick.
ZrIl3PwLaa	no you can not claim your child until it is born with a valid social security number.    good luck!!!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	You can't claim the baby until he/she is born and they have to have been born after 20 weeks.  You'll have to wait until the next tax season!  Sorry  :(|`|jNgh3e3Faa	You have to wait til the baby is born. (ss   is required on the forms and dob)  Congrats though.|`|1IDSGM71aa	You'll have to wait until next year. Sucks, but that's the way it is.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	In order to claim the baby, you need to have a social security number for him or her which you can not get until the baby is born. Since your baby will be born this year you will be able to claim him or her on your 2009 taxes.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	You have to wait. Sadly, the government doesn't consider our little miracles "people" until they're born :(|`|LggMpuQIaa	nope sorry but you have to wait till next year. Congrats though|`|Fm3L8vsYaa	no you cannot. im an accountant you cannot claim an unborn child.|`|9ffa956c569429ec4edaa430974fd5a1aa	not until the baby is born with a social security  |`|3OVn4Ceoaa	Yes as an account you have to wait until next year to claim the baby. You can't claim it until it's here and have a valid SSN...    Congrats on your baby though!!|`|Kz6M8NBEaa	You can't claim a person without a social security number.
7bc597034795bea4dbbecfea92484579aa	Tupperware!|`|1IDSGM71aa	Breast milk or formula?   Breast milk: Lansinoh breast milk storage bags or Medela containers  Formula: Any bottle with a cap. We really like Playtex Drop-Ins, but that's only because she has tummy issues and needs drop ins. I'm sure there are better out there.  EDIT: Sorry, didn't see that you were asking "where" earlier when I answered. Check at Target, Wal Mart or K Mart, and maybe Babies R Us. We don't have a Target or Babies R Us around here, so I'm not sure about Babies R Us. Last time I was at a Target, they had some, though.
wZAeBisbaa	Since we aren't doctors it's very hard to say what those symptoms mean.      I would guess the shots were antibiotics. Diarrhea and yeast infections are common side effects of antibiotics.  They are annoying, but usually not harmful. The usual treatment for yeast is an antifungal cream for the diaper area.  If the diarrhea is severe, it might indicate an allergy to the medication, or it could be something completely unrelated.  In that case, a doctor needs to make a diagnosis.     The change in medication might have just been from a brand name to an identical but generic drug.  It should make no difference to your son, but insurance companies will often only pay for cheaper generics. Still, you should get the name of the first drug they wanted to give him and check this out.      The continued fever indicates that something is not right. Since he has been in the hospital and has had many tests done, it would seem that it is either something hard to diagnose or they aren't worried about it. But even if it's the latter, your son is in pain and discomfort.  He needs to be taken care of.   I would clearly and assertively communicate to the doctor that you need to get this resolved right NOW, and if he can't do something about it you want a referral to a specialist. Also, give the clinic and hospital a written request for all of the records from this case. That might make them take this more seriously.|`|ynubwMqvaa	get some help and keep him healthy|`|5dca67bd0dd4aa9a8ea84176747ecb36aa	Where are you taking him?  Public hospital or a Children's Hospital?  If you aren't taking him to a Children's Hospital, find one and make the drive, they will take the time evaluate him correctly regardless of your insurance.  If you are taking him to a Children's Hospital and they are doing this, next visit ask for the doctor's name, write it down on a piece of paper in front of him/her and make this statement to the doctor, "if anything should happen to my son I will hold you and this hospital accountable."  That should wake them up.|`|AA10167940	Go to a different hospital.  Ummm, now.  The boil could be an abcess-  he needs medical attention ASAP-|`|ad4daf6f7da719b58951682b49e79c01aa	2 suggestions  1) Try another hospital, if that is not an option  2) See if there is a medical social worker on hospital staff who can advocate for you. It is easy for doctors to dismiss a mother as being over reactive. It would help if you had a third party involved.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	It seems that your boy has something serious since after all this medication continues to be bad.For the fever you should try cool bath at your own house and I would definitely change doctor!Try another one even though my personal opinion is that your son has to be hospitalised immidiately.Good luck|`|YqoxcTN9aa	to start with the boil needs to be tested, my grandchildren, 3 of them have all had something similiar    to this in the past & it ended up being MRSA- if you are not familier with that you should look it up, have the doc culture it!!!|`|AA12145826	Poor little guy!! Is it possible you can take him to another hospital? Maybe a pediatric hospital? I only ask this because we live in a rural area where the hospital is little more than a bandaid station (seriously we call it the County Hospital & Veterinary Clinic.....however I wouldn't take my cat there if I thought she had anything more then a scratch), so the 2 times we have had to take my daughter to the emergency room (Hand, Foot & Mouth disease and when she torn the little piece of tissue that attaches your upper lip to your gums), we've loaded up the car and took her an hour south to the nearest Children's Hospital.    As his mom, you do have a right to demand that he stay in a doctor's care until they make him better. If you live in the USA, they legally HAVE to treat you (and if necessary admit you) even if you have no way to pay them and no insurance. Stick to your guns, if you think they're not address the issue, tell them as politely, but firmly as possible that you aren't leaving until someone does something for him. Obviously he isn't getting better and it sounds like he has a pretty serious infection going on. Please trust your gut and demand he get the best care possible.
8uiH6iRbaa	yes it is very normal to feel sick with the pain i have miscarried 3 times and had sickness with all of them the pain will last as long as it needs to and bleeding usually about 7 - 10 days x    depending on the person as everyone is different and react differently !!    if you think you are miscarrying or have had a miscarriage its best to be checked over by your doctor just to be on the safe side because after miscarriage you are open to lots of infections and you need to be checked at the hospital to make sure the miscarriage is complete if its not you may need a night in at the hospital where they will perform a D&C which is a procedure where they clean you out     hope this is of some help xxx    please see your doctor as this could also be a ectopic pregnancy x|`|AA10820710	This is your body/life  you are talking about please go see a doctor...You assume ? ... Go see a Dr.|`|AA10405438	Pain is your body telling you something is wrong.  See a doctor.  NOW.|`|GqdC9Hx3aa	My first pregnancy was a miscarriage.    I had awful lower back pain and cramping. It was a planned pregnancy so I had been to the Dr. and the were checking my hcg levels. That's how I knew I was going to miscarry.    I had to actually wait and yes bleeding was heavy. You should go to the OB/GYN to get checked and make sure everything is ok.
9a3sNrEqaa	wait wait wait hunni girl!!!! Fertility friend takes a couple more reading to detect ovulation. Like say u ovulate on cd 20 it can take fertility friend a few more days of comparison to determine ovulation. My dr told me that fertility friend is a good tool but its not 100 percent accurate. Also when your charting your temps it doesn't detect ovulation until after it has happend. Thats why they rec. using the opks and then back it up with bbts to determine when you ovulated. HANG IN THERE HUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tons of baby dust to you!!!       ohh ps...sometimes on clomid you can ovulate later than expected. KEEP UR HEAD UP!!!!|`|EIVEQxdSaa	I got in this state last November ! i only have one ovary and my periods carried on as normal after i got it removed BUT in November i didn't ovulate adn i was devastated! i thought my chances of conceiving were all over. i too have a monitor and it detected nothing all month! My period came a week late so i went to the doctor and had a chat with her and it turns out i didn't ovulate as i had a really bad cold around the crucial time! I ovulated as normal the following month. Maybe your having an off month?? i was convinced my monitor on faulty lol!  Good luck x|`|T1hZG4O3aa	Has your doctor recommended days for you to have sex after you last clomid pill. My doctor told me that if it didnt look like I was ovulating to not way for the positive ovulation test and to just have sex a week after my last pill, every other day for a week. I started to not completely trust fertility charting because it was more annoying than it was help for me.It could be that this month you just didnt ovulate and the Clomid may not have worked this month. If you can print your chart out bring it to your doctor so they have a better understanding of whats going on.  I wish you the best of luck on TTC, I know how frustrating it can be.

vue9NOhYaa	I think a lot of it is that they know that people AREN'T perfect.  So if they say "eat 5 servings of veggies", then they hope that people will eat 2.  (But if they say 'eat 2 servings of veggies" then people won't eat any...)     None of us is perfect, but if we know what we 'should' be striving for, most of us will at least make it part of the way.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I just ignore all that and do the best I can. My veggies are mostly all steamed because we buy the boxed kind and throw it in the microwave...in 5 minutes we have lovely steamed veggies. But honestly nobody can be perfect...don't worry so much.|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	no meat and lots of veggies keeps the doctor away|`|Kg5KX432aa	oh man, I think the same thing every day!  Especially when you're pregnant. Damned if you do, damned if you dont.|`|AA10953561	People take themselves WAY too seriously. Especially in pregnancy. I started my pregnancy out worried about everything I ate. I couldn't eat fruit from the can, I had to have fresh. I had to have vegetables with every meal except breakfast. I still ate meat and other things but I was so focused on fruits and veggies that life became pretty boring.     Now days? I eat pretty much whatever I want. I don't eat my steaks rare anymore, but when my daughter is born in April, I plan on having a rare steak to celebrate. You don't have to do it perfect, just do it smart. Try to make sure you're getting the recommended amount of nutrients each day and exercise when you feel comfortable.    Good luck!
bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	I have done it with all four of my children. It is really sweet but it isn't something that should make you vomit. It does take a little bit to drink.

Hope all goes well for you|`|ryvO8DMaaa	The drink is really not that bad.  Just drink it as fast as you can.  It's just like drinking an overly sweet pop.

I wish I could of experienced life a little bit more before I was tied down with a baby, but as I said before I DO NOT regret her at all, she is my pride and joy, and i love her more than anything.

I was a straight A student, and got pregnant my senior year. I would never regret having my son who is now 8 months old, but if I could go back and wait 5 years before having him, I would. I regret not having time to enjoy life as a young adult and just having fun with my fiance as a couple, not as parents. I now have to go to college part time, work aprt time and be home with the baby all day with no time to myself. I would advise waiting until you have a college degree and have done things as a couple that you can't do with a baby (like travel) and then consider it.|`|GqdC9Hx3aa	I got pregnant at 19 (planned).

Never regret it! It's good to be young so you can enjoy your kids and be able to do a lot of things older parents can't do. I would hate if I couldn't' run around with my son at his baseball games.

Waiting until you are mature enough to be a good parent will benefit the child and yourselves as well as child raising is the hardest job there is. Me and my children had to grow up together emotional and though they are very stable and wonderful adults now they did have to deal with the issues of divorce, mainly because I was so young I married the wrong person just to get out of the house.  Everything I went through in my life though I don't regret as it has developed my character and I think I am a better person for it.

CVdcrY3kaa	Do you have a lot of humidity where you live? I know where I use to live in CA there was zero humidity and even at high temps like that it didn't feel THAT hot.

If you change your mind, why not buy your own baby pool?|`|xc8bnpCvaa	WOW I want to be where you are! It is cold here and I am in GA!   I think she will be fine. I'd def slather her in sunscreen, make sure you take plenty of drinking water (in a cooler) and a shady place to cool off. and take good unsalted snacks because she is going to want to snack and salty snacks will dehydrate too.    Have fun and think about all of us bundled up in jackets and gloves praying for spring/summer!|`|fb61d99b32eb382445becee914185af9aa	That is very hot, and can be a lot for a little one to handle.  I am from Australia and I now live in Greece, so I know about heat, and I have a 19month old daughter.  When it was the Summer here, she was never without her hat, and even though I liked dressing her in cool summer dresses, if you are at the beach, put her in a t-shirt and shorts so she gets a little more coverage.  Do smother her in sunscreen, make sure its a good brand, a baby brand with a high SPF, you can buy them and ask advice about them at your pharmacy (drugstore).   Always keep her in the shade, and do not put her in the direct sun, even if its in the water in direct sun, for more than 10 minutes.  Do not take her out at like midday when the sun is at its hottest, better in the morning or in the early-late afternoon.  Make sure your girl is well hydrated, so bring a lot of water for her, or tea or something, not so much juice, because its quite sugary and not as refreshing.  And fruit like melon, watermelon, grapes are really nice and refreshing, and easy for them to eat!  Don't forget her floaties, and have a good time!  If you see her getting red cheeks and she is sweaty and grizzly, you need to cool her down and take her out of the heat quick smart.    Have fun!|`|r9gBoBLCaa	Stay inside. The pools will be absolutely packed too. Have you got a kiddy pool? I nanny 5 kids, (9, 7, 5 & 3 y/o triplets.) For xmas, I got the triplets a kiddy pool. They LOVE it. =D
LFXTpqfdaa	Sounds like it is your baby! As time goes on, the kicks will get harder and more unmistakeable.    The poster who described the feeling as a muscle spasm is right on. It's like when you get a muscle twitch in your cheek or eyelid: you can feel it, but you're not doing it, and it's very isolated and specific to one spot (early on, anyway).    Last night, my husband and I spent a half hour lying in bed watching my belly twitch and jump. It was the first time he had seen that happen - usually he's very eager to put his hand on there and feel the kick instead. He was so delighted to actually see the movement this time.    I had given him a stethoscope for Christmas and he used it to actually *hear* the kicks, too. They sound like little thuds. Next we hope to hear the heartbeat!    Anyway, IMO the kicks are the best part of being pregnant. I'm excited for you. Enjoy them!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey,    Yes it sounds like baby to me ;)    i felt bubs at 14 weeks : bubbles going all up my belly. Every now and then.  16 weeks : Light thumps and movements (but i wasnt able to tell what part of body yet) Getting more reg .But didnt always feel bubs.  18 weeks : getting stronger but still light. Starter to feel diferrence between kicks and punches. More reg movement i felt.  20 weeks : getting stronger : kicks and punches were different feelings. As punches were less strong than kicks. Regular and more constant    24 weeks : all movement was clear and different.body Movements were different to punches and kicks. Reg and very clear movement felt.  28 weeks : Movement felt all the time.    as  they grow the bigger and stronger they get. so the stronger the movement get. For mums belly ;)  Some times when they move foward. Your belly will go into a odd shape . bigger on one side & Really hard. then theyll move somewher else. really cute.    God Bless x|`|mc6YtaRbaa	At first they feel like flutters and it will be hard to tell if it's the baby or gas! :) Once you start feeling a few the best way I can think to describe it is it feels like a muscle twitch. When your muscle twitches it's an involuntary movement, you can feel it, but you aren't making it happen. Once you feel the first few strong kicks you will realize moments along the way when you thought you felt something but you weren't sure were really the baby. If you have a pet, have the pet sleep on your lap. The baby can sense the extra warmth and heartbeat and will often respond. I have 2 small dogs and every time they lay across my lap my baby kicks them!|`|AA10953561	It sounds like it could be. I was 14 weeks the first time I felt my baby move. It felt like really small muscle spasms deep inside of me. It wasn't painful, and yours shouldn't be either. The movements didn't become regular until I was further along, probably 18 weeks, and that's when it felt like little pushes, or like a cat rubbing along the inside of my tummy.    Now at 27 weeks she's really starting to pack a punch. I love sitting in class and seeing my belly jump. One of my professors was in the middle of lecturing yesterday and he saw it too, he completely lost his train of thought. I thought it was pretty funny.    Anyway, this does sound like your baby moving to me. Good luck and congratulations!|`|rnTNu6MTaa	It 's amazing ! you will feel the kicks more often starting now and they will slow down when you get to ur 3rd trimester. because the baby will be to big, but you will still feel ur baby moving and when it drops u the kicking are more in ur ribs :) but at least it will only be for a short period of time. Some women complain that is a little painful, but we just have to deal with it :) .     Due feb the 23rd with a baby girl :) and she is kicking me in the ribs too :)|`|ipaAiX8xaa	It sounds like baby to me! :) Just wait till he/she kicks your ribs! lol|`|5UcdeeX8aa	That is the baby. The kicks get harder as you go along.|`|z0tn4PoAaa	It's pretty amazing the first time you feel it.  It can be anything from flutters to pushes to brushes...then they just start knocking you with all their little pointy extremities, and you can feel it when they have hiccups.    Enjoy it!|`|U5YVzW4Maa	Oh bless you.  Its the most wonderful feeling when you can feel your baby inside you.  It definately sounds like its the baby moving.  In my experience the feeling that I was getting was like little bubbles and flutterings behind my belly button.   Good luck and enjoy the whole experience xxx
Mvd0YfIPaa	I'm thinking if you have a daughter, give her your first name and Hope as your middle name.  Basically Kristina Hope (meaning she's your hope :-) )    Other names:    Desiree'  Esperanza  Asha  Amal  Amali (both Amal and Amali are for a boy or a girl)  Nadia|`|bUcWxQqpaa	kacy  kalia means flower/blossom ie hope  kyesha  kassidy|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Hope Elizabeth is a name I was thinking of using.|`|vt2VS0lDaa	Pilo Fecious|`|lKof1n0Xaa	Hope actually sounds perfect. You could try hope in another language to see if you like the sound of any of those, if you're looking for something more unique. But based on your situation, I think Hope is perfect for your baby girl.   By the way, the reason I chose to answer your question is because you spell your name like mine:)|`|9kdUmttPaa	go to babynames.com|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I think hope is very pretty for a girl.  The meaning of hope is One of the three Christian virtues (Faith, Hope and Charity).|`|jjUcYwG3aa	Hope is such a beautiful name. I don't know any good middle names to go with it though. Good luck and Congrats!!|`|yLa0PVqUaa	For me if I had a girl I would go with Olivia Isabella! Im not too sure about a boy but if I had to I like the name Marco! But Hope or Miracle are pretty names for a girl especially when you have great meaning behind it! Good Luck to you! :-)|`|fOBu5o2daa	try this will help and yes i like hope ....sounds great!  http://www.babynames.com/|`|3kNblp7raa	what about Serenity Hope or Angelina Hope (Angel for short)    Good Luck!|`|QmWzBERjaa	How about naming her Joy?|`|iYRBbpGWaa	For girls Asha means hope and for boys Amal means hope.|`|AA11707606	I think Hope is a great name.

wbkzpYhRaa	Okay dude, it could be one of two things.  Either it is from deep penetration, or cramping from orgasm, which often happens after sex.  If you are both clean, no worries.  It happens.|`|dPULl5hjaa	c a doc|`|rDsKB0uXaa	you did it to hard or your pregnant    good luck|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Nope. Never happened to me.

The in and out movement sometime allow air into you and causes gas.|`|8ZwUPVY5aa	I'm no expert, but there are plenty of reasons your lower stomach could experience pain.  Did you spend a lot of time using your lower ab muscles during sex, for example?  Were you, your fiance, or any of your furniture putting pressure on your stomach during sex?  Does it still hurt this morning?      Honestly if it still hurts, you might see your doctor.  Otherwise, maybe just re-evaluate your method of intercourse.  You're either doing something wrong or something very right.|`|50054aee173e5405ede8ebfa95e6cc24aa	He could have hit your vagina wall to hard causing some pain in your lower stomach. Happened to me my very first time you can imagine how worried I was! But I don't think you should worry much unless it continues after a week.    Other reasons:    UTI [urinary tract infection] - from not urinating after sex                              -or-  A small infection, not an std, but irritation in your vagina. Since the vagina is very dark and warm its a breeding ground for anything. Something that shouldn't be in there could have gotten there. Example: a lubricant you're allergic to, or even something as small and unnoticeable as a grain of sand!    My doctor explained that, because I had an infection, it wasn't like an std. All I had was a little stomach discomfort and took medication for a week.          OF COURSE:    You could be pregnant some women report signs of pregnancy as early as three days! But the pregnancy hormone doesn't effect your period until at least a week after conception. For me it took three months to get an accurate reading on the home pregnancy test!
eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	good question. My son is starting with a cough now too and it doesn't sound pretty...    Maybe it is because prescriptions they can limit what you get so the baby can only have it for so log but OTC you can "over do it and over use it"|`|swL7bQfAaa	Ask the Doctor you are obviously so keen to second guess after you run screaming to their office for their expertise! I am sure they will be pleased to explain their reasons to you.|`|436fREgIaa	$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$...  ITS THAT SIMPLE.    i always use otc before going to the docs,if it is an average cold.i also have a nebulizer on hand,and stock up.i also stock up on triaminic medicines.ALSO,give lotsssssssssssssssssssssss of fluids.if symptoms dont seem to get better,it could be an allergy.the average cold can linger,but if breathing issues are involved for such a long period,it may be allergies as well or asthma.if your doc doesnt seem to help much,next time,bring them to the e.r. as a last resort.they will run tests,and help in ways your doctor cant or wont.tylenol is ok for a couple days.thats about it.triaminic works better.chest and nasal congestion.also,use steam every few hours,until symptoms clear up too.if your child is able to blow nose,or cough up boogies..try it.it helps a lot.|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	because OTC doesn't always fix the problem plus the meds OTC are often for more than one issue and may have extra things in your son doesn't need. If you are unhappy with the way your dr has handled your situation you should find a different doctor. And always ask them before giving your child any OTC meds it may not be as safe as you think    good luck!!!|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	As a mom, I can totally understand where you are coming from, but your concerns are based on some false assumptions. OTC medication and prescription medication differ, but not necessarily in strength. The reason a medication becomes OTC or not has to do with the FDA and whether the substance is controlled etc. After a patent wears out on a medication, then it can become OTC. For example drugs like tavist or claritin were once prescription are now OTC. That being said....    OTC decongestant and antihistamines for children under 2 were completely taken off the market by the FDA because there were many issues with the dosage, especially for infants. About 10 infants even died because of the dosage. At this age the kids are so small, they were not getting the formula correct. I am sure you Dr would have loved to offer you a medication like this, but since it is not legal for him or her to do so, they could not. Additionally, though it has worked for you up until this point, you my want to read more on the affects of what you are doing and the dosage you are giving your child.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	OTC could medicine-Even for children-Often contains alcohol and other stimulants/depressants. Plus OTC cold medicine (for children and adults) has never been proven to have any really benefit. It's more like a placebo effect. The DR perscribed something she knew might actually work-Whereas the cold medicine isn't worth the money you pay for it.|`|3hIr3Dllaa	albuterol forces the lungs to open and improves lung capacity.  It's an anti-asthmastic.  None of the otc stuff you're talking about is going to do that.|`|vue9NOhYaa	A cold does NOT last 2 months.  A cold lasts about a week. If your child has been sick for 2 months, this is not a simple cold. It might be allergies, or he might well have reactive airway disease (the precursor to asthma), which is why the doctor prescribed the albuterol.      If you don't trust your doctor, and your child is still sick and in need of daily OTC meds so he can sleep at night, please get a second opinion -- preferably with an allergist or pulmonologist, who can help determine WHY your child has chronic symptoms cold symptoms.
fHjSonssaa	I'm laughing right now- not at you- but because my son roars and growls at me.  He is 10 months old and he started this a few weeks ago.  He does it lots when I'm changing him- or when he's sitting in his highchair waiting the food (that he doesn't even like to eat lots of the time).  It's normal.  He's just exploring his voice.  I think it's funny when my son does it.  Sometimes he sounds like a growing horse.    I don't think it means they're going to become a spoiled child- plus YOU are the one that decides whether he is spoiled or not.  If you like getting your son lots of things, then I guess he decides how to act- whether he is thankful or acts spoiled.  But that's years down the road.    Your son is just having fun right now. Enjoy it!!|`|0VHolTVEaa	My 10 month is the same, he wants attention so loudens his voice. Its nothing to worry about, its just his way of getting your attention|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Lol, he's experimenting with his voice. Wait until he screams and yells- just so he knows his voice can scream and yell :)|`|wzXJOSIeaa	My son is 9 months also and when I tell you that this boy screams at me...It's the truth...lol Not only does he scream at me but when he gets mad he slaps me. I guess it's just a phase that they go through. Personally I want to go off in a corner and cry when he does this to me. So I do know what you are going through. You are not alone. Best of luck to you.|`|dURFX4gOaa	my daughter is 8months a screams like a banshee lol i love baby talk even when its really loud hes not being a pain hes just enjoy the sound of his own voice enjoy it while it last it wont be long and he will be talking and then answering back ....|`|rdpZrBc9aa	It's perfectly normal.|`|AA10645224	PARENTING.COM    AND HE'S JUST TRYING TO BE HEARD    NOW IF HE WAS 9 YEARS OLD I'D WORRY|`|q1bLKRkkaa	Very normal. - He's learning he can make a variey of sounds and at different pitches...Course, the more he gets attention when he's being loud, will teach him that's effective (a spoiled chiild?).    So, it's up to you to determine if he really needs your attention, or if he's just "playing" with his voicebox...He sounds like a happy baby. :)|`|j65rSZ26aa	Wow my baby does the same thing! I was wondering if she was spoiled because she's the only kid but glad to know it's normal|`|DAtidXDZaa	I think it is quite normal and he is trying to learn to talk. The best way is to talk with him along with appropriate actions and definitely he will catch up and start talking soon say in three to four months...|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter is 6 months old and has a wide range of soft to loud tones for when she "talks". I can't see how speaking loudly will make a child spoiled though.
3hIr3Dllaa	The odds are very high...I'm suprised they aren't testing earlier than usual.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	My doctors thought I had this so I did some reading on it when I was pregnant.  I'm pretty sure you have a higher risk the second time around if you had it the first time.  There's always a chance you won't, but there's a bigger chance you will.  Good luck with everything, especially that gross drink.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Your chances are fairly high to get it with your second child.

Start NOW with the diet (you should have started the minute you became pregnant.)  You know you have to have strict limits on diet and you need to have a good activity plan.   Your babies life is at stake.       You are also 99% certain to develop diabetes later in life.   You can delay this with good weight control and activity.|`|lFPsPzxzaa	all pregnancy's are different.good luck
YIy3WqWgaa	Sounds to me like you might have some of your timing and facts confused.  I would suggest visiting a site like iVillage to study up on the basics of TTC and read through the user questions.      Basically, in a normal cycle you will ovulate around day 14--this is your window to conceive.  This varies from woman to woman (I ovulate on day 17).  If you are TTC, you should have sex often around the ovulation date...since you don't really know when you ovulate, I would suggest having sex days 12-18 or so (atleast every other day).  But, if you are using OPK, that will help you to figure out when you ovulate.  Follow the instructions on the kit carefully and start testing on the day it says based on the avg length of your cycle.  I think you start testing on day 12 if your cycle is usually 28 days, but if your last cycle was shorter you might want to start testing sooner.  Anyway, you should do the OPK around lunch time each day until you get a positive result.  Once you get the positive, you should ovulate within the next 36 hours.  Be sure you have sex during this time!    For example...We are TTC  2 now.  I usually ovulate on day 17, so we make sure to have sex days 14-18.  We might skip one day, but definitely days 16, 17 & 18.    There is lots of helpful information out there on TTC, but I have found iVillage to be a very good resource, check it out! and Good luck!|`|MbmHripJaa	It took me over a year to get pregnant and we were only having sex on the weekends... My friend was trying ALOT  and it took a year for her too. So I think after you get your period have sex for the 2 weeks after that. or every other day. also I found that when I conceived, and I have done research on this,, that when I am ovulating you get alot of discharge, like it is thicker than normal discharge.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	Okay if you just got off the pill your body is going to need time to adjust to that. Okay here is what you should do! Having sex every other day is NOT the solution! I thought that in the begin. but its wrong. If you have a regular 28 day cycle then you prolly do ovulate on cd 14. So what you should do is start on CD 12 have sex every other day until the CD 18.And obstain from sex until the 12 so that your hubbys sperm is super strong lol! But you should use OPK's so that you can detect your surge and be sure! So hang in there!!!!!! tons of baby dust!|`|BNJhyhKpaa	You and your hubby need to cut back on caffeine it can effect your chances of conceiving and yes that includes chocolate.  Also dont stress out this can cause ovulation issues as well relax do a work out non stress related. Try to lay down after ttc and stay that way for at least 30 min. If you still dont get prego prop your legs up on a pillow watch tv for about 2 hours I know a woman who says this is the only way she could conceive cause she thought her hubby had a low sperm count. Also use egg whites for lubrication this can help those little guys swim you can google that and read all about it and most of all PRAY.  The lord can do all thing like make woman conceive when doctors say there is no chance.  He will here your prays the bible tells us you hairs on your very head are numbered so you know he heres you
PLbmKNpvaa	Unfortunately our bodies are weird and wonderful things. There's nothing you can do about it, you will grow heaps overnight a few times. Many women don't realise that babies go though growth spurts inside the womb in a similar way to outside. Nothing will happen for a bit, and then *phwoop!* there's another inch of belly in front of you.   Enjoy the weeks in the 20's, I reckon they're the best because you have a while to go so the fear of birthing hasn't set in properly yet, but you're beginning to get things like big kicks etc. that make you realise that you really ARE pregnant!  As for the leaking, again, there's nothing you can do to prevent it. Perhaps get some nipple covers from the chemist to prevent leaking through your clothes, but you can't stop it, you can only hide it :)|`|mc6YtaRbaa	So far each time my belly has grown, it has felt like overnight I "popped" as I call it. You go to bed one size and wake up the next morning a size bigger! I can usually tell when it's going to happen because I'll have a little bit of ligament pain that day and the next day, bam, there's the baby belly!|`|1HLPznZhaa	Suggest you call your Dr.'s and discuss this with his/her nurse.. Could be a lot of things .. I would at least ask someone qualified to give you a medical opinion.. Enjoy your mother hood to -be..Good luck|`|9ffa956c569429ec4edaa430974fd5a1aa	Yeah sounds early for the leakage but I guess everyone's different, maybe warm showers and relaxing with a book will help. good luck in your pregnancy|`|Fm3L8vsYaa	nothing your pregnant thats just your body doing some changing literally overnight. enjoy,.|`|Kz6M8NBEaa	There's nothing you can do about it because it all comes with the pregnancy. Eating healthy foods will make you fell a little better.|`|OMOuxROoaa	nothing it is the fun of being pregnant|`|AA12143305	more than likely - the leaking is colostrum, since the milk itself wont come in until after your little one is born.  And the baby probably just moved or turned while you slept, youd be AMAZED how much bigger you will look with the smallest movement hahaha|`|9oeir478aa	Those are your hormones working over time for you and your baby. Your body is doing some amazing things on the inside. A cold compress like ice packs or cold shower could help the leeking. Maternity stores also make a pad that you put in your braw to absorb the leakage so you don't leek in public to much. My wife and I just went through all this and our son is 14 days old today. Best of luck. Being a parent is the hardest job you'll ever love.
GqhygphIaa	It depends on how long you really want him to sleep in. 8:00 is a pretty decent bedtime for a 2 year old. But I guess if your not happy with how early he is waking up then go for it! Set his bedtime to like 9:00. No later than 9:30-10 because he will get overtired.     If you can tell he is getting very tired, PUT HIM TO BED.|`|2pvAbIDUaa	my son is 26 months old and he goes to bed around 8 (after Caillou) and he normally wakes up around 6 or 6:30.

AA10862125	why don't you switch the first name and middle name around. that way you don't have to worry about hurting the 7 year old's feelings and your son will still be named after his dad and have his own name instead of having to share it with a "big" brother.    **george forman named all of his kids george and i'm sorry, but i think that's sounds stupid**|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Your husbands 7 yr old is not a Jr. He may be referred to as Jr, but he is not legally a Jr unless he has your husbands full name, first middle and last. If you name your baby the same first middle and last then your baby will be a Jr. I do think it would be a little weird for your husband to have 2 kids with the same first name, regardless of what their middle name is and who is a Jr and who is not.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	My son and I have the same first name, but a different middle name.  He is not a Junior, although some people try to consider it as such.  But for brothers to have the same name - that is asking for much confusion.  The scenario reminds me of the Bob Newhart Show, where he owned an inn.  There were three brothers all named Darryl.  Don't do that to your sons, even though it is not wrong.|`|IvkNTqDMaa	Nope...because that other kid is NOT a Jr. being that his middle name is different. You are only considered a Jr. if the name matches exactly (first, middle, last).    On another note...I think it would be weird for both of his children to have the same first name.|`|Mvd0YfIPaa	My cousin was in the same situation.  He already had a son that was a junior and when his last was born (a son), they came to this same scenerio.  What she did was combine his first name with another name (something that was flowy and cute).  She still basically named the baby after my cousin, but still kept the name original to the child.      Edit:  I would.  It sounds like it means so much to you to do so.  :-)|`|9EgS6uQzaa	Unless he has the exact, first middle and last name, he is NOT a Jr.  However, how would your son feel knowing that he has the same first name as his half brother?  I understand that you would like to honor your dad and husband, but it would probably be better to do that by giving him a name with the same initials or a similar name.   I think that it would also be problematic for your husband's first son, like he was being "replaced or pushed out of the picture".  How does your husband feel about it?  My advise is please don't name him that.  Additionally, from personal experience, my dad's name is John, my brother's name is John Jr., my fatjher in law's name is John, I have 2 uncles named John and my husband has 2 uncles and a cousin named John.  It makes it VERY Difficult during conversation, etc because everyone is always confused about which John it is!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No.Only one jr.|`|j65rSZ26aa	No it's not wrong the other kid is not a Jr. If you name your child the same name including the middle it will be a junior. I think it would be confusing for the kids because both their names will be the same.|`|AazUuzSSaa	nope it would be to wierd to have to boys being the same name just think about it.

fHjSonssaa	Extreme pressure for me meant my son was right there.  He was born at 33 weeks to the day.  I wa admitted about 36 hours before because I had a very small leak in my waters that they initially could not detect until I pushed them do more tests.    The pressure was ridiculous- if anyone says the pressure doensn't "hurt"- they're wrong.    I would go to ER- especially after my last experience.  I didn't have ANY contractions- and I dilated fully with no contractions.  I had NO contractionswhile  I delivered.  They didn't want to check my cervix while I was in the hospital because that can trigger labor and they wanted me to stay pregnant.  But when I told them the pressure was no longer bareable, they had no choice but to check me and there was baby's head.    Go- do't hesitate.  You want the best care if your baby is born this early.  Better safe than sorry.  I wish you the best of luck.|`|el8yX5q3aa	The health of you and the baby are your responsibility. CALL the doctor and see what he says...or go to the hospital.  I would go 100 times and be sure...than to Not go and put myself and baby in danger.    Good luck....and I am praying for you.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	if you're having very bad pressure then you should probably just try to get in to see your doctor first. that way its cheaper. if they can't fit you in today, then maybe a trip to the ER should definitely happen.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I would go just to be sure. You can never be too safe when you are dealing with a pregnancy.|`|rjVALevtaa	Having some pain and feeling pressure in your vagina is pretty normal during late pregnancy. But it shouldn't be so extreme that you can hardly move. Are you contracting at all?    I think you should probably call your doctor and see what he/she wants you to do.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	im almost 32 weeks with twins and that happens to me all of the time.  don't worry about it, its normal.  call your doctor if you get 4 contractions or more in an hour, or if you water breaks, or you bleed.|`|tn9sL3Ncaa	yes i'd go just to be on the safe side|`|LnJjgxMPaa	If you're worried now, it's better to be safe than sorry.  I'd call your ob/gyn and ask him.  If it doesn't stop or you can't get him/her, then I'd go to the ER.  Unfortunately, from what I hear from almost all of my good friends are moms now, frequent(sometimes pointless) ER visits the last few weeks of pregnancy or just something you have deal with.|`|z0tn4PoAaa	Call your doctor.  Sometimes the weight of it all just bears down and causes pain, but if you were dilated a centimeter last month, you should probably get checked again by your doc.    Good luck!|`|5O4Lne7Haa	if i you were you i would go its much better safe then sorry!!!:)|`|5UcdeeX8aa	Just make an appt with your ob today. It's more likely that just scared you and now you are freaking out about every little thing, but you should still make an appt with your doctor so he/she can validate any concerns. You don't need to be stressed out in your pregnancy either, worrying alone can make you go into labor.    EDIT- With the braxton hicks, have you been checked for infection? The pressure in your vagina could very well be from an infection that's also irritating your uterus and causing you to have a lot of braxton hicks. If that's the case, it can put you into labor and you definetely need to make an appt today! That happened to me this week with a UTI, so get it checked out.|`|64f66662454c0ed446e32154c55e475aaa	ring your GP or your midwife    i am sure it will all be fine. but get checked out just in case|`|sqUVjpElaa	Call your OB.  The ER aren't specialists, and they'll just tell you to make an appointment with your doctor.  The ER deals with emergencies, what you wrote isn't considered an emergency.     Seems like you should have had an appointment since one month ago.  Go see your OB like you are supposed to.  If you are overweight or really big for your babies gestation, you will feel a lot of discomfort.  You probably have a weak pelvic floor, and that will make it painful due to pressure.  Just spend more time laying on your left side and relax.  But definately make an appointment with your OB.  I know its rough, but do what you can to make the last weeks more enjoyable.|`|WgyGipBMaa	Call your OB na dske them what they want you to do
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Good heavens, it sounds like you had a rough time! Did you have a c-section?    Really I don't think any of these conditions are things that you can test for before getting pregnant a second time. All are acquired throughout pregnancy, if they're going to happen. Aside from high BP, which you can control through diet and exercise, I can't think of any tests that would determine if these things are going to happen again. What was the reason for IGR? Do you have a cleft/bicornate uterus? If so, that might not happen again, either due to the way the baby might grow in your uterus, in a totally different spot.     It depends on how your last doctor treated you during that pregnancy as to whether you should see a high risk specialist. All of these are conditions that can be handled by a regular OB, I would think. unless you felt you weren't being treated properly, I would probably just stay with the practice since they know your history (as long as you have a good relationship with them and like them).     here's to hoping that your next pregnancy is much, much easier! Good luck!|`|AA10316420	You definitely want to get a high risk OB doctor.  I was a high risk pregnancy and it was not a pleasant time.  Thank the good Lord I have 2 beautiful and healthy kids.  Sounds like you had a lot of problems with your first pregnancy.  Getting a high risk OB doctor is the best idea and he/she can monitor you closely so you can have a healthier and happier delivery and baby.  Congratulations on your lovely daughter.
26cnysY3aa	I have a mclaren! and i got it when my daughter was 11months she is now 20months and it GREAT...its lightweight and easy to fold! i travel alot...and its perfect and great value for money..    i couldn't recommend it enough! ITS BRILL!!    I found 3 wheeler really awkward to push (especially going yp kerbs! and heavy!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I am for the maclaren, any of the models.  We had a chicco too, and this one is a rolls royce in comparison.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Hi I had 22 prams with my two girls. The best pushchair I found was one made by Mothercare, that was back in 2004. I had my daughter in it with all my shopping on the pram and in the basket. (100 non alcoholic beers... for christmas) plus my elder daughter standing on the basket bit. (not very safe I know) I couldn't find a picture of it as they have probably discontinued it. Graco did a micro lite pram also but I cant find a picture of that either. I have enclosed a picture of a Mamas and Papas pram which is similar. A lot of people go for the Maclaren Techno XT I had one of these but I don't rate it as good as the micro lite prams. As for 3 wheel prams I never had one but my friend did and her wheel spun 360 degrees and flew off!!! If you have one with a fixed wheel you cant just go around corners you have to lift the pram, not good with a growing toddler!!|`|MNja3iwMaa	i have a maclaren quest for my 20 month old son. can't fault it at all. very lightweight but solid and sturdy feeling. used everyday and still as new.|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	I actually have had a graco full travel system and I loved it, until my daughter now 3 got to big for it. Now we have a McClaren triumph and I couldn't say enough good things about it. I do wish it had a larger basket but that is about it. Toy's r us has all models set up go in and put your son in them and see how you like them    good luck!!|`|1f7454e7b81f8ce36a73c7aca09a8c24aa	3 wheel pushchairs are awesome tp ush really comfy but the only problem is they take up lots of space, dont umbrella fold and quite hard to get on public transport if you use it. The best value 3 wheel pushchair is the Mothercare urban detour really awesome best pushchair ive ever had but unfortunately i had to stop using it cos it wouldnt ifit on buses    As for a normal lightweight pushchair you could get a Mclaren techno xt as these are the leaders in the market at 200 quid but I found a Mamas and Papas Pulse buggy to be just as good and stylish for only 99 pounds    Also you may want to consider looking on Ebay as people sell their pushchairs for more than half the price they cost new and as you will probably not be using yours for all that much longer it is something to think about     Good luck:)|`|QmeV1o6uaa	Hi, i would recommend the out and about nipper 360, there great and its a 3 wheeler, with a big enough storage basket - try looking at this site for one - they got good deals and there might be another pushchair you like.  www.babybrand.co.uk
x647LeB2aa	It isn't the name that causes them to be criminals, it's the fact that the kind of parents who 'invent' an unusual name to be 'trendy' and 'cool' are more likely to allow their children to run wild and go off the rails.    However, that is a generalisation and the celebs seem to follow the trend for unusual names too.|`|bJqVZqseaa	Excuse me you ingnorant bas.stard! My 9 month old son is called Jayden!! No its not a silly name and he wont be a laughing stock at all. You need shooting!    Oh and with a name like Hugo you cant say anything!|`|8twsa18Iaa	criminals are to blame for their crimes, not their parents|`|2ff000f507e5e958f455f4ef122e9c3faa	Does the name make the person then? I don't think that's true.Added to the fact that there are plenty of unusual names that are considered extremely acceptable.    I think the reasons someone commits gang rape of a person with or without disabilities are far more complex than the name they were given when born.|`|5BKHud3baa	Name causing you to become a criminal? Really.....I  think that is silly. Who is to say if a name is normal or not. I believe the President of the United States has cancled that theory. :)|`|UX0Otm6xaa	I think it really must depend on where you live. I live in New Orleans and black people tend to come up with very unique names for their children. In this city though the majority of the black population is below the poverty line and tend to gravitate towards crime so that perhaps my be one way to correlate the names to crimes. I wouldn't by any means say its a blanket that covers the entire worlds crime rate.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I am sure there are plenty of Peter and Michael and John and Tom's in jail as well. Your name doesn't make you commit crime.    I personally feel children should have a proper first name though. On a resume it looks nice. I think Nathaniel J. Stevens has a better chance of getting hired to a high profile job than Shaniqua J. Stevens, you know? When they publish their yearly report it looks better if the high ranking officers of the company have a proper name.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	You have confused correlation with causality.    There is a higher correlation between unusual names and criminal activity.  This means that among criminals, a larger percentage of them seem to have unusual names than the general population.    It does not mean that having an unusual name means that you will commit a crime.  Perhaps criminals with more mundane names get caught less?     This study seems a bit questionable to me, as it is based on something very subjective.|`|AA10820710	I don't think that's true at all... It's about how your parents raised you and treated you.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	You cant say that given them a different name will make them rapists or murderers or what ever. Its all to do with the person.    The name Englebert Humperdink is unusual, but he didn't turn into a rapist he is a famous singer.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	You know, that's interesting. I always thought that children with "silly names" grew up and became criminals because of deprived childhoods thanks to the parents. The mother gives the child a stupid name, for example naming it after a singer or actor, because she is of low intelligence or young and inexperienced. She sees the child as more of a toy or accessory than a child.     Children born of teenage mums/mothers of low intellect are more likely to grow up in deprived areas and so are more likely to "get in with a bad crowd." Also material deprivation in poorer families will lead to the child not being able to concentrate as well at school because of lack of decent food, study space etc at home meaning they have to find another way to get on in life and so urn to a "life of crime."    NOTE: I am not saying all children of teenagers grow up to be criminals, in fact there are some teenagers who make pretty impressive mums! (Especially when compared to the likes of Karen Matthews  ~ to name one that has been in the eye of the media for a while now.)|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Right. Because anyone with a name like Ed, Ted, David, John, Jeffrey, Gary....well, they aren't going to commit crimes are they? Because they have NORMAL names. Note, all names are christian names of "famous" America serial killers.   This research is seriously flawed. More likely to be socioeconomic and living environment factors that influence weather a boy will grow up to be a criminal. Not their name......|`|3m0elHd6aa	i dont think it matters what your name is   i think it depends on the individual, how your brought up and influences from other people and also where you live|`|vweoheAvaa	I don't believe in that, but at the same time, I wouldn't give my child a weird name.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Jayden is a rather common name.  I'm not for crazy names, but I don't put much stock in that study.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Why would jayden be a silly name? There have been lots of successful people out there with weird silly names that have come out successful. barack obama being one of them, i never heard of the name barack.  You cant blame a name on what a person will do. Some people out there are just mentaly sick. It has nothing to do with their name.|`|IR1IKoyeaa	In my opinion, the way the child grows up is based on the amount of care and teaching from the parents and the type of company he mixes in. But the name COULD make him bad due to him being a laughing stock and he wants to get revenge...etc etc... Thats just my opinion anyway...|`|vVTmJjJDaa	believe it or not, i'd read an article stating something similar back 15 years ago...(that boys given unusual names were much more likely to be socially ostracized by their peers and suffer from psychological problems as a result, even into adulthood)...which is precisely why my husband and i decided to give our son one of the 10 most popular names for boys in our country at the time....    he's happy with his name and fits in well at school (thankfully)...however, you wouldn't believe the names he tells me of some of the boys that attend his school..."Igor" has got to be the wackiest one - and my son states that this poor kid gets picked on *constantly* due to his name.  he's of the same ethnic and socio-economic background as all of the other kids...just what were Igor's parents thinking??
8uiH6iRbaa	hello there !    you could be pregnant i would try doing another test in a few days time if you still haven't got your period as you are only 2 days late you may have tested to early x    a tender stomach round the bottom could also be an infection !    i don't mean to get your hopes up but i had a very tender stomach when i was pregnant with my first one and i had constant stitch     another possibility is that you could be like me and you can feel when your ovulating so now may be your chance ;-)    if you are pregnant congratulations x|`|PLbmKNpvaa	I had cramping and bleeding with this pregnancy and I'm now at 29 weeks and doing fine. If you are feeling a stretching pain there's a good chance that you are still pregnant, although it's more common to feel ligament pain rather than your womb itself stretching at this early point.  It could also be (sorry to say this, but yeah) that you're miscarrying and having cramping because of that as well. Good luck though, hopefully everything is ok :)
MPCfQuT5aa	I'm sure no-one means to be nasty. I think you will have too wait until you see the nurse - the stomach pain could be anything from simple constipation to something more complex and may not be at all related to your tender breasts.  It took me 2 years to naturally conceive my 2nd child  -sometimes you just have to be patient.  Good luck|`|jNgh3e3Faa	I wish you luck. And going to the doctor is a good idea. It could be an ectopic pregnancy, I think.   Backwards womb?  Like the women on discovery who never knew they were pregnant.  :-)  Perhaps a UTI....or a pregnancy.   Who really knows?  An early ectopic pregnancy often feels like a normal pregnancy. A woman with an ectopic pregnancy may experience common signs of early pregnancy, such as:    A missed menstrual period.   Tender breasts.   Fatigue.   Nausea.   Increased urination.   As an ectopic pregnancy progresses, however, other symptoms develop, including:    Abdominal or pelvic pain, usually 6 to 8 weeks after a missed period.4 Pain may get worse with movement or straining. It may occur sharply on one side at first and then spread throughout the pelvic region.   Vaginal bleeding that may be light or heavy.   Pain with intercourse or during a pelvic exam.   Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting (syncope) caused by internal bleeding.   Signs of shock.   Shoulder pain caused by bleeding into the abdomen under the diaphragm. The bleeding irritates the diaphragm and is experienced as shoulder pain.    Not saying it is that...I am just being as informative as I can.   As you said, you are going to the doctor which is a good thing.   Try not to worry or stress though.   (this was not nasty, I think...so I hope you do not take it that way?!)|`|AA10953561	I'm not sure what could cause the tenderness and pain. Sometimes when we want to conceive so badly we can almost bring on phantom pregnancy pains. I don't know if that's true in your case, but I don't know what else would cause this. Sorry I can't be more helpful.    Good luck and baby dust!|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi you could be pregnant and its too early cause if you gota 35 day cycle the past couple of month then you should wait till the 35 th day and test and if its neg and you still dont get a period then test in a few days after your missed period. good luck.|`|S5v9I0y2aa	It is possible that you may be pregnant, judging by your symptoms. Maybe you are having a longer cycle this month, and it would be too early to test.  I had symptoms over a week before I could test, and it was killing me to know the result!!    But I tested 2 days before it was due, and got a faint positive, than I bought a digital one the next day and it said, YES+.    If you are having sharp, one-sided pains though, it could be an ectopic pregnancy, so get checked if the pains continue.  I had bad one-sided cramping up to 7 weeks but my pregnancy was normal.  (cramps like period cramps)    All the best and Baby Dust .:.:::.:|`|z1YM1Xniaa	If you were to have cramps in early pregnancy they should be all over cramps or feel like ovary cramps. You def want to tell your doc that you are sore mostly on the left side. That can be a sign of an ectopic pregnancy. That's what my doc told me when I was having cramps. Also do not get discouraged yet, I got a negative digital test 3 days before my missed period. But I was already feeling extra hungry, sleepy, and peeing alot. Then I got 3 positives 2 days after my missed period. So good luck and I hope you feel better|`|f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	It sounds like it could be completely unrelated to fertility.  It sounds like you could have a kidney infection or some other sort of UTI.  Kidney infections will cause terrible back back as well as tenderness in the abdomen. See your doc, also, keep in mind if you're peeing as much or less often as usual. I hope you feel better soon!
dDVAUA9saa	Check out the book "What to Expect the toddler years".  As someone else said, lots of things.  All kids develop at different rates.  Also try babycentre website.    Please don't listen to some of the responses.  Yes, some children can speak in sentences and do other miraculous things at 2 but that does not mean that they are "normal" for this age.  for instance, my book says by 22 months they should know 6 words, but my daughter knows about 200 words!  The book will give you a guideline.|`|oIyXMnmcaa	Pysical developement at the age of 2--should be able to run with good balance and be able to use stairs and railing with no problems. Should be able to kick a ball with moderate posture and balance.     Verbal- by the age of 2 the toddler should be able to say 50-100 words. They should be able to understand more complex  directions such as "put the ball on the table".    Children are very busy and active at this age. They will climb onto everything and enjoy running, fetching and carrying. They want to decide what to wear and want to dress themselves. Children at the age of two really love to pretend play. Creative activities done with crayons, paint, parpe and other art materials offer a fun experience for this age. These actvities encourage eye-hand co-ordination and fine mortor skills and give the child a sense of control.    Good toys for a 2 year old to learn about the world around them include:   wooden car, truck or plane  large nuts and bolts  building bricks  toy workbench and tools  rocking horse  simple jigsaws  large cryaons and paper   play table and charis  toy tele    The child should be familiar with some shapes and colors at the age of 24 months. By the age of 3 they should be well on their way to spelling or sounding out there name and should know all of their ABCs.|`|ETeWLHEGaa	his or her name, their colors, their numbers, how to walk, how to talk, their alphabets, how to go potty lol..., etc.......|`|3ZYeUdAtaa	My son is 2 and I care for another boy who is also 2. They both know each letter of the alphabet by visual recognition, as well as the sound each letter makes. They can both count to 20, recognize colors, shapes, and animals and their sounds. They are currently learning how to spell their names and how to visually recognize numbers. At this age, children are like sponges. As long as the information is presented to them they can learn it.|`|GqhygphIaa	I would say... at least saying sentences. I don't think the alphabet until like 3. They should feed themselves with a spoon. Drink out of sippy cups. Look online or ask your doctor because all 2 year olds are different.
dd15228a42b4652d8768334912349b61aa	I really don't wish to sound harsh ~ but by the time May comes round, you could find yourself just wishing for a break yourself, and knowing that your baby would be well taken care of, a single week away on your own with friends could do you a lot of good ~ also at 6 months, your baby will not take in the surroundings as much as it would at say, a year old.    Just a thought.|`|vue9NOhYaa	By all means go.  At this age baby doesn't yet care where she is, as long as she's with you.  In a few years you'll have to worry about keeping the child entertained, so now, go someplace YOU enjoy.  The beach (keep her shaded from the sun), or an urban vacation with museums (the sitter could watch her if you wanted to go to a show, or a really fancy restaurant for dinner), or a place in the countryside where you can hike/walk/relax.  Whatever you do, baby goes in a sling/carrier or stroller, and goes along.    EDIT: I would not go away WITHOUT baby for more than a day or two at that age.  She still needs her mama -- and if you are breastfeeding, you can't leave her that long anyway without compromising your supply and the odds of her nursing again upon return.      Go away, and take baby along.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I'm confused if you are asking if it's ok to take your baby with you or leave your baby at home with your parents.     If you want to take your baby with you, he or she would love it.    If you are looking to leave him or her at home with your parents I personally would only do that for a long weekend. I don't think at that age I could leave my baby alone for any longer.|`|JFr7fCiXaa	yer the baby will prob really enjoy it at this age as he can explore a lot of people find babies are really well behaved on holiday, their getting a lot of fuss made over them for a start!|`|gTWgbpNFaa	you should fore go the holiday & get on with raising your child|`|AA12279950	Definitely.  You'll need a break by then!  We went away when my son was 7 months old and I was 5 months pregnant with my daughter (yes, they're very close together!) and we had a wonderful holiday in warm southern Spain.  Enjoy!    Edit:  Oh.  Unless I've misinterpreted and you're asking if you should go away without baby?  In which case, the answer is no.  Either take baby with you or don't have a holiday.|`|GqdC9Hx3aa	I first went away on a trip when my baby was 6 months and he was fine!    It really helps that your family will help you out.    Enjoy and relax on your holiday!|`|6lFyNdcHaa	Absolutely, as long as you have every thing your baby needs, yes. just make sure you make the trip comfortable for him or her, bring things that she uses on a daily bases so its not such a transition, and you don't have a fussy baby. my daughters 9 months and we go on short trips all the time. shes great with it.
Hu9yquP4aa	There are a lot of factors that go into that not just some dates.     Have you been pregnant before and was it easy to conceive? Any fertility issues?     If no, and you ovulated on the 1/16 and had sex that day you have a decent chance BUT ideally you should have sex the day prior to ovulation and the morning of ovulation to make it really happen.     Sperm can move slow and not reach the egg in time if you wait until after the peak time. I read on the internet that most ovulations occur mid day for some reason.     Good luck!|`|ejJD6BBXaa	i think they r pretty high|`|uhj76Fkpaa	high ones
vue9NOhYaa	How can you 'suspect' that a condom isn't safe?  If you thought it wasn't safe, why didn't you use a better one?    In any case, you should not use PlanB twice in one cycle, and there is no need to.  The first time you took it kept you from ovulating this cycle.  That lack of ovulation will last until your next cycle.    Please educate yourself about birth control so you don't have repeated 'accidents.'  PlanB is for emergencies, NOT for regular, repeated use.|`|yNbGq4viaa	Sure, take as many as you want.  In fact, sounds to me like you need a prescription.  Maybe you could keep them in a Tic Tac box.  While you're at it why don't you just go ahead and actually have your boyfriend come into the OB's office with you so you guys can try out the stirrups and then she can just pop a pill in your mouth afterwards.     How about a little personal responsibility here?  I mean it's not that hard to figure out a condom and if you're having problems figuring them out, how about abstaining until you get on another form of birth control?  It sounds like the fewer chances we have of you reproducing, the better.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	you have to ask your doctor. it cant be good to be putting all that stuff in your body..     you should really go on some sort of bc other then codoms if your not ready for a child.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Honestly, you will need to read the box insert on how safe it is to use the pill that frequently.     Also you may wish to investigate why you are having condom issues. They make varying sizes to fit all size men and also figure out if a back up method should be used.|`|n3IoftMFaa	Here's a novel idea: Since you suck at using condoms - GET ON THE PILL OR GET AN IUD.    Jesus.|`|VxINaY0Eaa	YES, take the second Emergency Contraceptive. The only side effect of taking 2 EC's in a short period of time is that you may bleed more or bleed less at your next period. This is waay more solution than having to deal with an unplanned pregnancy. Please take the second dose of your "Plan B" approach. Time is always of the essence. Do NOT wait. And next time, please, for your OWN sake, protect yourself and your future!|`|Xu4zdMhbaa	Have you considered a hysterectomy?  If you are constantly worried about reproducing then it would be a good way to end all worries.  If not that then maybe have your tubes tied.  It is not 100% effective, but still better than what you are doing, or not doing rather.  Seriously though, you should really reconsider this sex thing until you understand "safe" sex.  And tell your boyfriend to get condoms that are actually his size.  Would he rather be a father or a smaller size?  And jeez learn to use proper English.
bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	It's completely different for everyone.  Some people get pregnant right away while some can take a couple of years.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	Judging by most guys, 30 seconds.    Eat Funyuns.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	stop taking the pill first of all. Then anywhere between 3 months to a year|`|JwDWwgIcaa	um...stop taking pill, do someone, and i bet u will be pregnant.     :D|`|w1kvhxX5aa	a girl can get pregnant 2 times a month if she knows the best time without a test right away|`|v0GwTTsVaa	You haven't been on the pill very long, so it could take anywhere from 1 to 12 months.  When a couple is trying to have a baby and there are not fertility problems - they tend to get pregnant within  a year.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Depends what pill you were on...some women can fall pregnant straight away, other take a couple of years...just depends on your body.    Good luck and have fun trying! x|`|BrjyljGIaa	About 2 minutes and 20 seconds the way I do it.|`|R0RaP5wZaa	how ever long it takes the sperm to get to the egg|`|2HH1PSnVaa	okay. Fall on what? And i don't think you'll get pregnant with the pill|`|zYGJh5Odaa	probaly 30 seconds|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	everyone is diffrent but it took me 8 months|`|z1VUlArjaa	i heard that it can take up to 9 months to get pregnant|`|mxixfE3Raa	Anything up to a year is normal when trying to concieve.|`|esdjKGeBaa	About 6 months. If it takes more, you might need some treatment.|`|3yEr2T8baa	3.33 seconds to be exact|`|AA11103493	Everyone's different, it can be anything from one time to a few years.|`|yDNv30Okaa	the average time to get pregnant is 1 year, and you need to add 3 months on to that if you have just came off the pill, or any other contraception other than condoms|`|AXEqOEloaa	That is hard to say every situation is different, but after I was off it took us 2 months.|`|N6N7YMAaaa	How long does your husband take to eyaculate?|`|lFPsPzxzaa	no one can really answer that it's different for everyone|`|ZHyYVo9Naa	I am not really sure what your question is...you need to be more specific in what you are asking.  "to fall on"???  I think you are asking about how long it may take to get pregnant after you stop taking the birth control pill.  Or are you taking a fertility pill?  Maybe you should ask your regular doctor about this... it may be much safer.|`|oScCDhMJaa	It all depends every woman is different it took me 6 months the first after i came off the pill and then i miscarried, then after that a year and im only 24 so that just goes to show how every woman is completly different!! But they say it will take up to 9 months a year to pregnant first time.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	I was off the pill for 13 months and just now got pregnant.   Some people, like my mom, got off the pill and found out she was pregnant the very next month.
ZtCyxfpfaa	Because it is far easier to tell young children. The baby bump appears to be in the stomach so the term is used to soften the explanation to children. Actual details af pregnancy would confuse them.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Sounds a bit easier than saying uterus or perhaps they mean abdomen.   Yes, that works.   :)|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It's just a gentle, age appropriate way to explain where the baby is to a child. I would never say that to an adult but a kid won't understand what a uterus is.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	To be honest I think it's because people revert to what they're told when they're younger without thinking. We tell littlies that there's "a baby in mommy's tummy" because if we said "there's a baby in mommy's womb/uterus" we'd get a lot of stupid looks and a 1000 question hour! Lol. I guess it just becomes habit to say that it's in a womans stomach.|`|8ENRWmoMaa	stomache is not only the organ but the mid section area.  When people have a "stomche ache" the pain is usally in the intestines.  they dont say i have an intestine ache.|`|1IDSGM71aa	I have no idea, but I've wondered the same thing. When talking about it before, all I've ever said that was close to that was "tummy" and that was usually when I was talking to my four month old like, "I'm glad you're not in mommy's tummy anymore so I can hold you," etc.|`|8YltlMsjaa	thats just easier to say I guess, and sounds better around children..     I dk really, never thought of it*|`|3OVn4Ceoaa	Kids don't know the difference and that's mainly who we tell that too...a smart person knows that the baby isn't in the stomach. It's actually in the uterus to be technically correct.
DDswEgtZaa	your period can start while still taking the provera.  for me one cycle i only had to take 2 pills and my period came.  another cycle i took all 5 pills and period didn't come until 5 days after my last pill.  so it is unpredictable.  i called the DR and gave me instructions.  good luck.|`|IhhvG1Cnaa	I would finish taking the pills, i have PCOS also and its a pain in the bottom isnt it not knowing when you gonna have a period and when you gonna go months without. I may be preg now but i am waiting to test a little bit nearer what should be my period. Good luck to us both eh??    **********baby dust**********|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun! yes you should finish your provera pills. That happend to me one cycle. I started spotting on my last day of pills my dr said that it was okay. Hopefully you will have a full blown period in couple days instead of waiting the possible 14 days from the last pill!!! Hang in there hun and TONS OF BABY DUST!!!!!!!|`|FMTuvujXaa	Hi,  Dont worry, its not a problem at all. I have PCOS too.   First of finish ur provera dose.   You will only bleed 5 days or a week after.  I used to be just like you....but with clomid + glucophage i'm better now. my cycle's are on time i know when i ovulate, skin is better, weight under control. Only thing with clomid is that it makes u bloated, depressed, have a headache...etc.Just take your meds on time n just hang in there, it will work. all the best.
UX0Otm6xaa	I have not had the test but I have heard spotting is normal after one. Its in my what to expect when expecting book. If you get cramping or a lot of blood call you OB right away, b/c I believe there is a higher chance of miscarriage with that test and with an amnio|`|ce437eacba23b245ed5c4ee833f7b13daa	Spotting after any test where they poke around in there can be normal.  The cervix is very soft when your pregnant and even sex acan bring on spotting that is no danger.  The best idea is to ask your doc anytime bleeding in pregnancy is involved though.  Goood luck to you and congrats on your babe.|`|9ffa956c569429ec4edaa430974fd5a1aa	be sure to get ob appointment as soon as possible, if you spot more go to a er goodluck
ZrIl3PwLaa	You can get pregnant ANY day of the month, however you have greater chances of pregnancy when having sex around your time of ovulation which is generally about 14 days into your cycle, but the exact day for every woman is different.     good luck!!!|`|b3CwObBdaa	I wasn't going to answer this question because the answer is kinda obvious.  It's called OVULATION.  If you are ovulating than you can become pregnant.  If you're not than you don't.  Read up on it.|`|3OVn4Ceoaa	All I know is when you ovulate you don't need to have sex if you're not ready for a child. Birth control or not...I had sex a week after my period and got knocked up. Not that I'm complaining cause I love my baby boy already it's just the facts. I thought I was invincible for some reason...NOT!! :)
vue9NOhYaa	He can eat them when he can eat them.  If he's physically capable, (can pick up small pieces of food and put them in his mouth), then he's ready.  Most babies are ready between 7-9 months, so by all means give it a try. If he can't manage it yet, wait a week and try again.    And, in the meantime, don't worry about him taking little or no babyfood.  He still doesn't really need anything but breastmilk or formula.|`|rjVALevtaa	He could probably eat some finger foods. Like small cut up pieces of banana, cheerios, unsalted crackers, and small pieces of cooked vegetables.|`|rrrKPAZGaa	Mashed potato  Mashed banana.  Mashed steamed vegetables.|`|AA11656721	Solid food at one year old.  Stage 3 in Gerber Products.  Age six months can start Stage 1in baby food.|`|rnTNu6MTaa	Usually around 6 months and with something easy...u introduce a little banana to the baby...but just like a table spoon next to some other solid food. And he will like it. And you can even cook soup and mix it and it will be like mash potato, that is very good for the baby too.|`|zc9ZhoMIaa	I have an 8 month old and she has been so intrested in my food since about 6 months old. I started her on jarred food at 6 months. BUt she gets mad when I eat and dont give her mine, even if i am feeding her at the same time. So I always make a lil bowl of instant mashed potatoes so she can eat them. She eats the jarred food ok, but perfers "grown up"lol food. She also eats the gerber biter biscuits. but i watch her with them cuz once they get soft, she has choked a lil on them when the pieces break off. Also bought the gerber dried fruit pieces the other day. They dissolve pretty quick, but she tried to put 2 pieces in her mouth at once and chokes a lil. I will not try cheerios yet because i ate them to see how fast they dissolve, and I do not think they dissolve fast enuf. But she has 2 bottom teeth coming in right now! :) Just try things but watch closly to be sure everythign is ok!
6k5fhFyBaa	Not an early sign.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Could be, but it could also be PMS.  Take a pregnancy test.|`|Kz6M8NBEaa	yes, I had constipation when I became pregnant.|`|m0DgqEcjaa	it's not a sign that you are pregnant, it's constipation, you can getting if you are pregnant or if your not pregnant lol    A pregnancy test will give you the answer, surely?
uhj76Fkpaa	You're too early on your pregnancy to can tell for sure.Many times a girl looks like a boy at this stage.I would say that it's a girl.Have patience!|`|AA10820710	A boy for sure! I see something if you had a girl we couldn't see anything at all lol|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I am horrible at these things, but the first picture looks like a boy to me and the 2nd one I can't tell.|`|zoH6rMCPaa	I'm no expert but that definitely looks like a boy to me.    Congratulations by the way!!|`|HXfHkoSHaa	these look like side views of the baby, not the crotch. sorry.|`|DV4xyeChaa	you must be joking avbout the sonogram...ask your DR...|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	looks like a boy to me to|`|UX0Otm6xaa	From the first pic I'd have to say BOY!
iR9w7d7Yaa	Sorry but whatever we say will not help you unless you take a test. If you rule out pregnancy then go to the doctor's for some tests.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Hannah- I'm not sure what kind of answers you are looking for but the only way you are going to know if you are pregnant is to take a test- they are cheap!  And the only way you are going to know what is wrong with you if you AREN'T pregnant is to see your doctor.  If the bleeding you had really was your period, then you aren't pregnant.  You don't get a period when you are pregnant.  If you ARE pregnant, then the bleeding was from something else entirely.  Take a test and see a doctor.  These links explain why you DON'T get a period when you are pregnant.  Pregnant women that experience vaginal bleeding THINK that it is a period but they are mistaken.   http://www.justmommies.com/articles/peri...  http://blogs.webmd.com/healthy-pregnancy...|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Well haven't you taken a test yet? Why on earth have you not been to the docs for confirmation?    Of course yes it is possible to still have periods and be pregnant, certainly given all your symptoms.|`|hE2gRG18aa	ur pregnant|`|uhj76Fkpaa	Why don't you take a test to be sure?I know that you can be pregnant and have your period.Check it out|`|vtBW6oQMaa	You could be pregnant as you can still have periods when pregnant. take a pregnancy test. Good luck to you xx|`|rnTNu6MTaa	Go ahead and take a pregnancy test to make sure or go see a doctor . :)|`|f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	Chance are very slim that you're pregnant.  It could be a number of things causing all of these symptoms, including you THINKING and stressing over being pregnant. Go talk to you doctor.  They are the only ones who will be able to say for sure.  Good luck!|`|OMOuxROoaa	you can still get a period and be pregnant ....rare but it happens...just take a test|`|66a2033899b05175e184558f79110fe4aa	bladder infection etc etc|`|giEXhSTIaa	The veiny boobs and particularly along with the other symptoms certainly makes it sound like pregnancy. I would take a test. If it comes up negative and you are still unsure, get to your GP and ask for a blood test. Hope this helps. :)|`|Gj3vLQJAaa	You could be, or being stressed over it could make your body "think" you are when in fact you are not. Have you taken a test yet?|`|LQnKhiVMaa	what are these periods like?? if they are heavy and bloody then i would say u are not pregnant, if they are very light and dont last long then possibly yes... u need to take a test,   u cant have a period and be pregnant!!!!!! but u can bleed at certain times of the month that may resemble a period,|`|DHlNNfKdaa	i think you may be pregnant i have known peopel to hav periods and still be pregnant, you sound like you have the symptoms of a pregnancy take a test   good luck

McDonald's/Burger King/Chuck E Cheese/Chick fillet/ or any other restaurant with food and a play area  16 take a nap together  17. watch an appropriate movie with all the goodies (popcorn,candy)  18. have a "slumber party" sleep outside with flashlights and sleeping bags tell safe ghost stories or adventure stories  19. have a treasure hunt  20. have a scavenger hunt    i could go on and on but..there are tons of websites with ideas as well HAVE FUN!!!|`|5p3m2fdFaa	Playdough,  Reading Books,  Pretend Animals/Farms,  Television,  Outside Activities Like Football Or Walks.

You can read, paint, color, cut out things, glue, start learning the numbers in order and by looking at them and the same with the ABC's,  sing songs, go on walks, go to story time, play at the park, skip, jump, hop, dance class, gymnastics class, music class, and let them help you out in the kitchen when your cooking.  I hope that this helped you out.  ~Take care and best wishes!|`|tn9sL3Ncaa	-taking him swimming  -buying books  -small world toys (e.g little people brand have farm houses and train tracks that are age appropriate)  -taking him to the zoo  -stuff to draw with   - taking him to the park  - the shops   - theres also a tv channel called cbeebies that very educational and stimulating|`|gSteSrogaa	3 is a wonderful age! Just old enough to explain stuff too...they can do almost anything, if you take the time to teach them.    Play a "copy mommy" game. Jump, run in place, rub your belly, get them to imitate you.    Tell a story and get him to act it out with you "the bear is chasing us, we have to run run run!" and run in place. "Oh, here is a big tree to get away from the bear, climb climb" and make climbing a ladder motion. Make up any story and do movements with it "looking for the bear" put your hands over your eyes and look "swimming in the lake" with swimming motions "get our binoculars out" and put your hands in circles and look through like binoculars...I'm horrible at making things up, but you get the idea...    Hide a toy and have him find it. "Where's the bear?" and "help" him look for it.    paint    clay    slime, goo, silly putty (other fun gooy things to get their fingers into).    read a book and point out things in the book. My daughter is now starting to ask questions about the words. She points at a word and says "What's that?" then I read the word to her. Or, ask him questions about the book.    Cards. A simple game I do with my daughter. She gets a bunch of cards and I get a bunch. Then I tell her "give me two cards" she gives me the cards, then I ask "How many do you want?" and she gives me a number and I give her those cards. There is really no point to the game, but it encourages counting.    coloring/drawing. Will he draw simple things like a circle for a face? I started out by drawing a circle and then my daughter would tell me what the face needed and I would draw the eyes, nose, mouth. Now, I tell her and she draws these things (not always correctly), but its her effort that's important.    Dance and sing songs. Don't forget to twirl him around or "dip" him.    My daughter loves patty cake or itsy bitsy spider (with the hand movements). I have also taught her "Here's is the church, here is the steeple, open it up and here's all the people"...if you happened to know that one. This came in handy for teaching her to wash her hands...I would tell her to "show me people" to get her to rub her fingers together.
AA10949589	i don't know but i am truly sorry to hear about your situation. u just made my birthday a very sad day.|`|sk46uigvaa	Free in the UK on the NHS, With 2 doctors signatures|`|Hu9yquP4aa	up to 1250.00 USD    http://www.fwhc.org/abortion/abpill-comp...|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	never heard of a surgiclal abortion. regular ones are from 500 - 800. depending on your insurance.     and if you know you  have a problem dont you think you should be on bc to make this not happen!!!!|`|1IDSGM71aa	I agree with what Mommy 2 Be says. Just because you don't think you can have a baby, doesn't mean that you can't. There is a possibility. As she asked, what's the condition? I'm completely against abortion except in very, very rare extreme cases, but I don't judge women who want to have them (unless they use them as birth control) and I'm not judging you. You should report the rape, if you didn't consent to the intercourse. Seriously find a really good OB/GYN to sit down with and discuss your options. If it's only delivery that will be the problem for you, then you could have a C-section. I know that since it's a surgery it sounds scary, but according to all the people I know who have had one, it's really not too bad. An abortion will not be cheap at all. The only thing I can think of is Planned Parenthood. If I'm not mistaken they will give you one for little or no cost, based on your situation and your financial situation. You will have to be over 18 to have an abortion. I'm really sorry for what happened to you, but you might want to look into other options before an abortion, since even you said that you think it's wrong. And if you don't want to keep the child, there's always adoption, which I know you have probably already thought of. After this is all over, whether you have the child or not, you really might want to get on some form of birth control. That's what I would do. If you don't mind, please keep me updated, hun.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	you NEED to tell your parents. hiding this is dangerous and foolish. i'm sorry you were raped and i'm sorry this person has been beating you up. have you gotten away from him? if not, then you better do it and soon. he could end up killing you.      an abortion on average costs 300-600 bucks if you're in your first trimester. if you're beyond the first trimester, then the cost will go up.     please stop being foolish and get help.|`|D1qDptKYaa	i'm really sorry to hear that.. :(  i think you should ask a doctor for the price as i'm not sure..  but it won't be cheap!  hope things work out for u  good luck xx|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. Okay what exactly is your medical condition b/c often times there are injections to counter-act what the problem is. (depending on what the problem is) And what do u mean the baby was already abused hun? How many weeks are you? If I were you I would sit down with an OBGYN you can trust and go over your options. If your condtion prohibits vaginal delivery you can always have a c-section. I know you must be going through a lot and I am not judging you I am just trying to help you see your options. Also if you didn't consent to having sex that is rape and you really need to talk to someone hunni. You really do. I really hope that you get everything figured out. Ill keep u in my prayers|`|tn9sL3Ncaa	i'm sorry for whats happened and this is not related to your question but to one of the answers to this question, she has already said she has an illness and that she didn't consent to having sex so therefor she wasn't planning on getting pregnant read the flaming question properly before answering!!! you may cause her more upset! and more heart ache!!

I have 3 month old twin girls (fraternal), when they were born, everyone could only tell them apart due to there sizes (smallest 4lb 14oz, biggest one being 6lb) is quite a difference in weight. But I'm not sure it really matters that much as even though they are nonidentical, I now sometimes have difficulty telling them apart myself!!! I feel terrible when I have to work out which one is which. lol|`|6YTjC3Aqaa	awwww ,,,identical|`|H2fnYgG2aa	I dunno but they are so cute! x|`|wgxYJ2Fgaa	fraternal..the noses look a lott different to me|`|n05GDUcUaa	they look identical to me, they are gorgeous  :)|`|5O4Lne7Haa	i think identical|`|PcQuOmWqaa	I think fraternal.

My wife had no problem with her insurance coverage while being pregnant.|`|SRDPnnIMaa	wow they screwed u over|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Nothing unless you got it in writing. Unless you can meet the criteria for the medical insurance such as 30 + hours, then they can drop you at any time.     Can you increase your hours? If you have not worked the required year + so many hours in the year you will not be eligible for FMLA and they can also eliminate your position too. You may want to call your corporate office and speak to a supervisor.|`|AXEqOEloaa	Unfortunately this is the sad reality for most americans right now. I hope everything works out for you.|`|w7FSmSTnaa	you can get on state aid and they will porvide you with insurance to cover you and youe child|`|CRhS02q8aa	Find a lawyer and get some legal advice.  Seriously.  I would also try not to miss anymore. I know how hard this is, I have been there. You doctor can actually give you some medicine to take care of the sick feeling.  Also, there are medicaid programs to help you in this type of situation. I would also call them and see what they say.  You may not have to pay a dime for you or your baby.  That is what they are there for.|`|AA11113606	Have you been unable to work more than 30 hours a week due to your pregnancy? Have you told your employer this? Will you health care provider document this for you? Have you worked more than 1250 hours in the past year for this employer? Does this employer have more than 50 employees within a 75 miles radius?     If you have answered yes to all of this...please do the following:  1. Ask your HR manager why FMLA hadn't been offered to you in the past.  2. Request FMLA now. Be sure to read your company's FMLA policy and FOLLOW IT...be sure to get your paperwork in from your physician by your company's deadline.  3. If you qualify for FMLA, and they still drop your insurance, talk to your HR department and ask them politely to reinstate it, or you will contact the Department of Labor. It is as much the company's responsibility to offer you FMLA when they know you have a qualifying event (pregnancy), as it is your responsibility.    Good luck!    Also, in the future, when dealing with your HR department, get things in writing!  That way you have the documentation, and you can't forget or misunderstand...|`|6lFyNdcHaa	try going to social services, ask about PCAP (Prenatal Care Assistance Program) insurance for pregnant women, im not sure about all the financial qualifications, but its worth a shot good luck...
ZrIl3PwLaa	well sadly she may be hurting inside because of blood disorder she NEEDS to see dr. She could have some problems that kind of drastic weight gain/loss is not normal or good by any means.    Think of her health before your relationship, you were adult enough to have sex be adult enough to take care of her.!!!!
gx4s68s8aa	I guess I am a little confused about your question.  Did the doctor tell you that you needed a specialized ultrasound for a medical problem or did they say that you might want one to see more of the baby just for curiosity?   If it is because of a true medical problem then they are most likely telling you to go to a high risk doctor or perinatologist (means high risk doctor).  I get special ultrasounds every couple of weeks since I am high risk due to a clotting disorder.  If it is a necessary ultrasound then your insurance will pay for much of it.    Or if they may be just telling you that you might want to get a better picture for you own curiosity.  Then there are places all over the country that do 3D scans for people for to do that for non- medical reasons.  Just look in your phone book.  I have know idea how much those costs, because mine are all necessary.|`|jiTKnCKpaa	They are called sonographers,are you in the UK? It should be a qualified sonographer who does your scan at the hospital and you shouldn't have to pay
HhmhSBpgaa	Tough to say. A blood test would tell you right now. Urine could be another couple of weeks.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	It isn't very likely. You would be around 4 weeks gestation, and a test should say positive by then. But I would wait a few days and re-test, just to be safe.

They also have Huggies Newborn for the same price  http://www.diapers.com/Product/ProductDe...    I've never seen the Newborn Size of either brand of diapers at a wholesale store like Costco or Sams Club. I've only seen larger sizes such as size 2 and up. I think they have a size 1-2 bulk box. It's always worth trying - but even if you look online at their websites - they don't have that size. Even Babies R Us has only a  92 bulk box and it's more expensive then diapers.com.     Diapers.com also has a free shipping for orders over 50 and $10 of 50 if you use this coupon:BABY10    Good luck!|`|1IDSGM71aa	I'm not sure about NY, because I've never been there, but if you have a Wal Mart, Sam's Club, Target, etc. near there, you might be able to find them. If all else fails and you are ok with doing so, you could order online at www.diapers.com they have TONS of stuff. Honestly though, you might not want to get a big box of newborn diapers. You might want to invest in one or two small to medium sized packs of newborn, then get boxes of size 1+ because even if they are born skinny enough to wear preemies (my daughter wore preemies for a couple of weeks), they will still go through diapers really quickly at first because they will double their birth weight very fast. I think my daughter might have worn newborns for a month (again, she was really small at birth, 5lb, 3oz). Some babies are born and can wear a size 1, too. I think size 1 is from like 8-15lb, so if your baby is a 7 pounder or more, you might just want to get size 1 and up in boxes.|`|Ka52nbhNaa	I have found the best prices at BJs Wholesale Club or Diapers.com    Here is a list to the BJs locations - there is one in Brooklyn:  http://www.bjs.com/locations/    Here is a link to Diapers.com - if you use this code, you can save $10.00 on your first order - TNXR6306:    http://www.diapers.com/Product/SubCatego...|`|3hIr3Dllaa	target

V7Q7SbHfaa	That sounds just like my daughter, she is 7months 1 week and she eats 3 meals a day and has 24oz of formula and maybe some juice.  She gets about 2 tablespoons of cereal and 1/2 a container of stage 2 fruit in the morning at 8am then 2 hours later a 8 oz bottle.  Around 12 or so she gets 1 container of stage 2 veggies and then a few hours later a 8oz bottle.  At 6 she gets 2 containers of stage 2 foods, 1 veggies, 1 fruit.  She only gets the fruit if she finishes the veggies.  Then at 7 or 8 her last bottle for bed which is 8oz.  Throughout the day she gets some snacks and some juice.  I know it sounds like a lot but she is 20lbs and 29inches both above the 97% on the baby charts.  If this is what works for you then keep doing it.  As long as your baby is happy then enjoy him.  I love having a healthy baby who loves to eat.|`|wP0AjcQ1aa	Well you are his mom so you really are the one who wil know best.    My son is 6 months old.  I nurse him when I am home.  For breakfast he has cereal- Oatmeal mixed with banana (pre-mixed)  Enough to put 2 ounces of formula or BM.  After that he nurses or finishes the bottle... 6 ounces total  Lunch he gets a whole jar of stage 2 fruits  After that he nurses or rest of bottle  Nurse again in afternoon or another 6 ounce bottle  Dinner he gets a whole jar of stage 2 veggies  Usually wants to nurse again by that time and then Nurses at 7:50 to go to sleep.   He gets a biter cookie once a day while we eat dinner.    He is 16' 10oz 25% percentile|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	he sounds like he is eating a lot of solids- right now formula should be his main diet still. each baby is different but my son was only eating solids once or twice a day at that point  juice is not important and too muc can ruin his teeth and diet    he can start eating table food not pureed too provided he can pick it up and gum it in his mouth, teeth aren't needed|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	sounds about what my son use to eat/drink  as long as hes no getting an upset tummy id say hes eating enough  if hes showing signs of still being hungry increase the amount of cereal he has in the morning x x|`|TqOdbhNAaa	I just started cereal for my 6 month old so I'm not where you are yet.

Good luck!|`|0VHolTVEaa	Sounds like the same amount i gave my son, i start weaning at 4 months and sounds like the same amount. Its fine, if he didnt want it he wouldnt eat or drink, keep an eye on his poo, make sure its not runny or hard. Otherwise its great your son is eating meaning he wont be a fussy eater when hes older.|`|UxKtGC9maa	my daughter has just turned 8 months and is having 3 lots of food a day as well has her 4/5 bottles of formula milk. in the morning she has 6oz bottle and baby cereal, then her next bottle and some other food. For her 3 bottle i just give milk then in between that and before her last bottle (if she only has four feeds) i give her any kind of vegeatables that i've pureed and 1oz of baby juice. then her last bottle before bed.  My daughter had one meal, then increased to 2 then 3, so it's best just to follow your baby and they will let you know when they need more. If he is happy enough to eat it then you are doing all the right things. You obviously know what you are doing, so just keep doing it. And just increase the quantity every so often, if they cannot eat all of it then just go back to amount you normally give. But it sounds like you have a very content baby as far as his eating habits are concerned x
kVBDpAMTaa	It is checked my taking blood. They will take about 2 vials. The cost is usually around $150.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	a thyroid test is a blood test called TSH test. (thyroid stimulating hormone) So they can see if she has hypothyroidism or hyerthyroidism. Both of the 2 are easily treatable. Sometime the thyroid needs to be removed. If she is feeling fatigued it could be her thyroid or she could be iron deficient. Which is called anemia. Anemia is very treatable with iron supplements. I don't know how much this testing will cost you bc costs differ in every country. Hope ur wife feels better!!!!!!!|`|J71oCIi2aa	hi actually thyroid test is taken in blood i had done this ...dont worry about  that u consult a doc first .....but checking thyroid test is better to know whether thyroid is normal or not.

EAeffKqSaa	Congrats on baby  3!!!    I'm 15 weeks and have the same problem. I did some reading on line to see why I was hurting and it I found out it is our muscles in our tummy stretching what doctors call " round ligament pains" which is called growing pains.    As our uterus gets bigger the tissues surrounding it stretch which cause shooting pains on one or both sides.     What we can do to lessen the pain is to get up slowly, changing positions slowly, use a heating pad, take Tylenol and just get lots of rest.    The pain should stop within a few weeks as your ligaments get use to the new role.      Hope this helps you.    Good luck.|`|WgyGipBMaa	Stretching|`|3OVn4Ceoaa	It can be your uterus stretching to accommodate your new baby...if the pain is bad though you need to see your doctor. As soon as possible.

XiiJQkLQaa	Depending on what class he got the F in, you should have him read a book for that class, or have his teacher give him extra work to help him. I am trying to think how they did it back in the day when we never had all these electronics and cell phones. I do remember my dad making me read books and him having me write a report on it...I know I am not much help but that's all I can give right now...Good luck ?|`|TqWXXZ34aa	Don't be in such a hurry to punish him. Try talking to him. Asking him what's going on for him to get an "F"... Ask him if he understood the assignment?  Ask him if he thinks that he may need more help; after school. You could always get him a tutor. believe me that is a punishment in it's self. Having to do school all day then coming home and doing more school. Kids hate that... Yell him that you are getting him a tutor 3 days a week after school. and when his grades go up then there will be no more tutor. He will thank you in the long run later in life. he may just need some extra help. Help your kid dont punish! Punishing does nothing except make your child act out in worse ways then he is now.|`|ZUw8DBJVaa	sorry but....no cellphone, no videogames, no friends?....and u want to punish him too??????... he's obviously having a hard time right now and cannot concentrate on his homework...i am 16 years old and i know that under these conditions i wouldn't even get an F...and i am a good student!...i'm sure you love your son,so you should better worry about his feelings more than his grades!!! parents don't understand!!!!!:(|`|9zwSclnLaa	If he has his liscense, take away his driving privledges.

Sometimes you do get bad grades.It's quite normal.I would suggest to give him a break since, maybe he's got something going on in his head and he simply won't want to tell it to you, as all teenagers.    But if you were to punish him..i'd advise sending him to dance lessons or blackmailing him to do so. I think it would work.    Really, it happens.Sometimes you don't study enough. Leave your son his personal spaces, he's 16.If moms get too oppressive things can only get worse.|`|IU2Znlv3aa	Have you any idea how hard it is to ask for help or admit that you can't keep up and are failing.  Luckily for me, I never got an F, but there were times that i failed a couple of tests and didn't tell my parents and the reason for that was mainly that i didn't want to disappoint them.  What helped me most, was getting a tutor after school for the subjects i needed to do better in. If my parents had punished me for getting bad grades it wouldn't have helped me improve.  Also if they had insisted on me showing my homework to them and them emailing my teachers i would have been absolutely mortified. It would have made me resentful of them and i wouldn't have had the motivation to do any better at school.   By all means, call the school and schedule an appointment with his teacher where you can discuss how you can help him improve his grades, but i think punishing him for it is a bad idea. If he knows he will get punished for bringing home Fs, why would he come to you in future when he is struggling? It's all good and well saying to us what he should have done, but have you told him? Get to the bottom of the reason for his F. In my opinion punishment would be counterproductive.|`|PiqojaIraa	My parents sat me down and told me what they expected from me, and then took me out to dinner, I graduated with a 4.3 Average and AP calc.       Take him for a ride into ghettotown, that's what scared me.|`|ehEIpHgYaa	driving?|`|jTFdG8xqaa	Well i was grounded for i belive just over 2 months for failing one class one quarter, but my situation was differnt in many ways. I had lots of friends and tons of things i wanted to do...luckily i had my own computer hahahahaha! But for me it was laziness too. I wouldn't ground him persay, but i know what i wanted (or now realize would have helped) was someone (ie my mom or dad) to ask what homeowork i had to do tonight, and then have student (me per say) to show completed homework. Weather you understand it or not you can tell shody work. If ever night there is no homework i would get in contact with teachers (email is a beautiful thing) and have them tell you what assignments are due. Explain to him that you will be keeping track of how he is doing and that he needs to get his work done. Do what you can to help him, and maybe he can get some of that focus and drive back. Good luck.|`|AA3X2Om5aa	He doesn't need punishing.. he just needs a private tutor or something?  He just needs a little extra help along the way, ya'know??|`|XXw7DUDRaa	dont punish him|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	wow though one, the only thing I can come up with is make him study at the table with, in your presents,and help him on what he failed on and what he is not doing well on in other subjects. Also explain to him that the facts show that kids behaivor  and performance can and will be the same in the working world. i.e. late for school, late for work, stay home from school alot because I`m sick, same for work, and the big one, poor grades = poor work ethics. Good Luck ! hope this helps some.|`|zdGpaFlfaa	beat his @$$|`|0C6VJ8mqaa	he needs help, not punishment|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	I think you have identified part of the problem...."nor does have any friends in our new neighborhood"...I would work on his social schema before I would worry about the F. Clamp down on him with his school work, take away TV if that will motivate, but I have found that kids that are happy dont suddenly bring home a F. I am not saying he does not need a punishment, but what are you doing to help him make friends? Make him join a club or activity or a church group.|`|2LfMvxwBaa	Your comment about having no friends in your new neighborhood - is there any chance he's just struggling to settle at the new school. You should attempt to remedy this before accusing him of laziness - he may not know or like the teacher, may be getting used to a new way of working etc. If it continues, by all means start punishing him but for now he needs support and encouragement rather than punishment.|`|XYOYml59aa	you can't do anything to make him pass. Not punishing him anyway. I agree with some of the people that saying he is having a tough time. He is pretty much isolated  as it is. Punishment would only make this worse.   Try to get him to have fun, relax a little, things like that. No one wants to work when they are stressed, sad, etc.|`|P25GuvNjaa	Can you not just discuss it with him?  Its not like he has gone out and done something deliberately bad, he is a young adult, treat him like one.|`|VcIg1R1zaa	Not let him go out or sitting on the computer

ZrIl3PwLaa	good question, i hate barney as it is but now that you point it out i recall never seeing an adult guess it's a good thing my daughter doesn't know who barney is.!!!!!|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	its not that deep guys,  jeez its a show.im guessing the cast and crew and parents all around are enough to watch the kids.television is for entertainment, not realism.    EDIT:  i dont like barney myself, but thats just not an aspect of it that really applies.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Hey, Barney's a dinosaur.  Which makes him at LEAST several million years old.  Surely that's old enough.    (But yes, when my daughter was of the age to watch Barney, I wondered the same thing.)|`|iZDsMCghaa	Lol, I used to wonder the same|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	they will be watched by ppl just outta shot of the cameras plzzzzzz do u really think they alone|`|GU3RauKOaa	That actually bothered me as a kid. When I was really little I just thought barney was watching them, but as I got a bit older I realized he was imaginary, so where are the grownups?!    Like Elmo is supposed to be 3.5 years old and he just wanders around sesame street all day. Where are his parents? Even if I lived on sesame street I wouldn't let my toddler go out alone!|`|hcRGqk2gaa	Good Question. I never took the time out to think about that. My daughter doesn't watch Barney... at least not at home. It's the same thing with Max and Ruby... if anyone watches Noggin with their kids. Max and Ruby never have their mom or dad there... the grandmother comes to visit every now and then. Dora too. She runs around with a Monkey all day to far off places with no supervision.
5Crovdoaaa	I'm not sure if your wife is the kind that prefers jewelry or what, but when I had my last child, my husband hired a cleaning service to clean the entire house! I had been gone for 4 days and knew my other two would be trashing the house, and I was stressing about cleaning it before my in laws came in. It was SO nice to walk into spotless house that I didn't have to clean!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My husband bought me a laptop while I was pregnant.  I thought it was the perfect gift, both for a pregnant woman who just wanted to lie on the couch all day, and a tired new mom up in the middle of the night.  I also used it while I was in the hospital getting induced!    Another good gift for a new mom is one of those little, one-button video cameras, like this:  http://www.mysmallwonder.com/    But if you don't want to spend money on electronic (I personally just happen to really like tech toys) than anything thoughtful would be nice -- flowers, a massage, anything.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My husband was in Afghanistan when our daughter was born, but he sent me a locket with both his and our daughters initials engraved. It was beautiful, and extremely sweet considering our circumstances.|`|LvywvZSeaa	My sister in law gave me a necklace with 4 hearts on it...one for me, one for my husband, one for my oldest son, and one for the new baby. It was very sweet, and I will treasure it forever. Something like that would be nice.|`|fHjSonssaa	My partner just gave me the cutest brn lamb stuffed animal- it was a nice one.  He gave it to me to hug and holdin the hospital because I had a strange and complicated delivery, my son was in the NICU because he was born 7 weeks early.  I just needed something to cuddle with (that wasn't as big as my partner in the small hospital bed after giving birth).  I thought that was very sweet.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	When I first had my baby, I just really wanted something good to eat! Find out what her favorite meal is....breakfast, dinner, dessert even....and bring it to her either at the hospital or at home. She probably wont want to go out and leave the baby yet so bringing it to her would be nice. Oh yeah....and some time. I'm sure she will need that in a week or so. Help out as much as you can with random things and give her time wo recover. Jewelery wont hurt either ; )   Good luck!|`|jVhWIDRnaa	My husband bought me a silver bracelet with a solid silver heart attached. On the heart he had her name and birthday engraved on it. I love it! I get compliments on it whenever I wear it.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	Flowers  G/C to a massage or to get her hair done  Pedicure and/or manicure|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	Nothing you get your wife is going to top having a baby! She's going to be in love with your baby and thats the best present she will ever get from you.      But if you looking for amterialistic... a nice card and maybe some nice [not crappy hospital] food would be nice.|`|6hA0O06xaa	A spa treatment gift certificate (along with you babysitting).  She may not be able to get a massage for a while (docs recommendation) but she could get a facial or manicure etc.  She'll need the relaxation!      A nice new bathrobe, a pair of cute comfy sweat-pants or yoga pants, and some comfortable slippers or fuzzy socks would be great.  Make sure you get the right size!    Or you could hire a housekeeper to come a few times during those first couple months (if you don't have one already) to lighten her load.  These are all things I definately would have loved!|`|xc8bnpCvaa	Ear plugs! (JK) Mostly your help in the middle of the night, help with the household chores etc without complaint. That will be some of the best things she could ever receive from you. That and be a good daddy and hubby!      CONGRATS ON THE BABY!|`|l6QPKcoLaa	A fruit parfait or a basket of fruits would be nice with a baby book those books that you put the babys first steps, first cry,first laugh that book.

Take the baby and tell her to take the day off!  :)|`|U7Fvw8g7aa	A combination of nice silk pajamas, neck pillow, house/bath robe, a big soft pillow, bedspread, bath towel, bath gels, lotion...anything that will give her a better rest and a better shower time. After all that, don't forget to give her roses too.|`|4XtRFTMUaa	A simple piece of jewelry (maybe the baby's birthstone color).|`|QOITXwDIaa	A symbolic piece of jewelry that can have stones added to it later if you plan on having more children.  (birth stone for each of you or just diamonds representing each of you)      Or hire a mother's helper or cleaning service to come in once a week for the first month or so...then she will have more time to bond with baby and actually REST as opposed to spending all of her time and energy cleaning and/or cooking.      Or you could write her a really heart felt letter, letting her know how much she means to you that she gave you this child.     Congrat's!|`|b6baOLOeaa	My husband got me a necklace from Things remembered. It has my nickname and birth date engraved on one side and my daughters birth date and nickname on the other.   But really the best gift you can give is support. Take the baby so she can have an hour or two to herself. Make her take time for herself. Let her know how wonderful you think she is. New moms need that reassurance.
4YfehneDaa	Some people never test positive on a urine test, go to your doctor, or planned parenthood, and have them take a blood test to get a defitine answer.  I know for me when i was pregnant i had "period" cramps and thought for sure i was getting my period, but it turns out cramps are common early in pregnancy.|`|cbfb39e3aab3b803822e39f849209291aa	It sounds like you could be pregnant as your symptoms do appear to resemble some of the other women on here that have conceived but i guess you will find out for definite on 1st, Good luck|`|SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    In early stages of my first pregnancy i got the same symptoms as you with the nausea, tiredness etc.  I also had slight cramping the day my period was due, but no period turnt up.    It does sound like that you could very well be pregnant, and your experiencing early symptoms.  If you get a negative on the 1st, and still no period then it would be best to make an appointment at your doctors for a blood test as they are more accurate and detect low levels of hcg.  My body took a while to produce high hcg levels, i had 8 negatives before i got my positive, and i was 5 weeks pregnant at the time.    Wish you the best of luck with taking your test and hope you get the results you want.  Take care xx

vue9NOhYaa	I'm a bit confused on the timing of all this stuff, but ... lets see:    1. Once you are already pregnant, you will not ovulate again.  2.  Sperm can live in your body for several days, so if you had unprotected sex a few days before ovulation, the sperm can live long enough to lead to pregnancy when you DO finally ovulate.  3. Pregnancy symptoms dont' start until at LEAST 10-14 days after ovulation ... so if the unprotected sex was quite recent, those symptoms are very unlikley to be due to pregnancy.    Best advice: Wait until your period is due.  If you get it, you're not pregnant.  If you dont'get it, do a test.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	You do not ovulate if you are pregnant already.   The stretchy is found when ovulating, yes.   Mild cramps? Maybe you are experiencing implantation cramps. I never had those myself, that I know of.   It also sounds like you could be sick.   I also have the breathing trouble and a cold and cough, chest and back pain.   I was told I may have pneumonia, though.   I assume you want a baby.(unprotected sex) I hope you are pregnant if that is so.   Good luck.|`|S5v9I0y2aa	You can still get changes in discharge in pregnancy.  The other signs you are describing could signal pregnancy.  I know people that have become pregnant from pre-ejaculate, so it is possible for sure.    I would definitly take a test if you are late on your period.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Wait until your period is due, then test with your first morning urine.

8XcRFF6Taa	I know you can get help from "Early Intervention" it's a program for children with developmental delays and/or disorders, it is available in all fifty states.  They will test her and whatever problems she has(if any), they will set her up with a specialist, all for free.  My son is a little delayed in his articulation of speech.  He sees a speech therapist at our local elementary school twice a week for 30 min.  It really has helped.      Here is the link to get you started good luck!  http://www.eifamilyalliance.org/    Also I read that flax seed oil helps children with attention spans and hyper activity.  It is also very good for their brain.  I give it to both of my kids every morning in their breakfast.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Call your school district for the delayed preschool.  They will assess her and get her into the program.  I have a son like this, and he gets speech, and other things too.    Here is an assessment that might be useful:  http://www.childbrain.com/pddassess.html|`|3K2H4zB4aa	You can get on the internet and find developmental activities you can do at home.  There is also a website that tells you where your child should be at certain ages. I don't recall the website but if you put developmental screening in the search engine you should be able to find it.   I hope that helps!|`|o5Ez7Gyraa	it starts at home, no need to pay money. shes young work on simple things ABC's 123's make them fun. Sing and make up a whole dance to abc's shes learning, and exercising at the same time! try things like that..  Flash Cards with words like The, Cat, Rat, Dog ect...to familiarize her with words. read books.  Wait for the appointment and then go from their.

(check out webmd.com)   Don't show worry or concern in front of your child though. She might pick up on that and grow incurred.|`|o7wGYLZ5aa	READ, READ, AND READ TO HER.  Start with simple 5 minutes and then let her go back to her own world.  make a schedule, follow it.  Increase to 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 minutes.  If 5 minutes is too long do 3, and 4 to begin.  Dont let her do what she wants tell her you both decide but that most of the time it will be yours.  Time out when she does not listen only 3 minutes though.  Sit her down in the same plac always, if she refuses stay close and put her back on.  Its one minute per year.|`|fj31ZjrVaa	It is very hard to guess, and not really fair.  It seems to me however, that what you are discussing is a "speech and language developmental delay."  Many children have severe language problems that are mistaken for intellectual limitations.  Speech and language delays and intelligence are not necessarily (most often not) related.      Continue with testing by your local Early Childhood Program.  If you have not already contacted your local school district about early testing, do that.  They have professionals trained to work with children like your daughter.    Grandpa

jaP0TANdaa	Under the right conditions (i.e. fertile egg-white cervical mucus) sperm can live up to five days inside a woman's body, and some experts say sometimes even up to seven days.

zc9ZhoMIaa	I recently bought a humidifier for my 8 month old! I bought a warm mist, and its one that has the lil cup over the steam chamber to put the medicine in. Not really medicine, but over by the humidifiers, there will be liquid drops you put in that lil cup and it works wonderfully! We put it in our bedroom where we all sleep and it is just awesome to walk in there and you can breathe. I used the humidifier for 3 days and she was better.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Always use a cold mist, the warm mister harbors bacteria and virus's, open a bottle of Vicks in the room the odor is all over the place and the humidifier blends makes a medicated vapor without fuss.|`|4TNavgDuaa	I have a cool-mist. We did try warm-mist but my daughter would cough alot when it was warm. I also used Vick's Baby rub works wonders! Also Johnson & Johnson vapor bath. I notice a big change after the vapor bath and she was able to sleep much better. Good luck!|`|eya1WDS4aa	My son is sick right now and i have been using a warm mist vicks vaporizer. Works like a charm. you fill it up put some of the vicks liquid in there and plug it in, it really helps with my sons congestion.|`|l4mMBe5Aaa	We have a cool mist humidifier, and use it often (especially during the winter, when the indoor air is dry).  I have heard that the warm mist ones can breed mold and bacteria more easily.  I received ours as a baby shower gift, and I actually used it myself before my daughter was born (I was always stuffed up when I was pregnant!).  So, I can speak from experience that it really does keep your nasal passages more open!
dnG7fhnbaa	"The adoption process" refers to checking that you will make a suitable adoptive parent and that your home is ok for a child to live in. It also includes the time taken to find a baby to be placed with you.    Once a suitable child has been found for you the transition from foster home to your home is fairly quick.    Before you will be "cleared" as a suitable adoptive parent you will have to attend verious meetings with social workers and child care workers. You will be allocated a social worker and she will conduct a few home visits and will probably want to meet other members of your family, especially other/grown up children if you have them. You will then have to wait till a suitable child is found, it's usually a lot faster if you want an older child than if you are looking to adopt a new born.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Much of it depends upon the type of adoption you do.  Some adoptions are arranged for before the child is born.  Kind of pre-approved and set up for once the birth occurs.  Many don't like this kind of adoption but they do happen.  Also, sometimes in foster to adopt situations where infants are taken from birth parents due to neglect or prior histories there are adoptions done of very young children.  In my own case my wife and I were matched with a 4 day old who had been apprehended at the hospital from parents with an extensive history (6 prior apprehensions of children) with social services.  She was finely adopted by us by the time she was 5 months old.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	A friend of mine adopted and it was not a private adoption firm so while I haven't done it myself, I can only speak on what she has told me. When a child comes available you let your representative at the agency know if you would like to try for that child or not. If you want to try for it, all the representatives who have parents that wish to have that child meet with a mediator and they work it out in a room and decide who gets the child. It was very hard for my friend because although in the end she got a wonderful little boy, there were so many children that she tried for that she didn't get picked for and there's nothing you can do about it. You just know the day they are meeting and you wait for the call to say you have a child or you don't. But again, this is not private adoption. I don't know how that works, just that it costs a lot of money! I think in the end she was trying for about a year before she finally got her son.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Because by time you have been matched with a potential biological mother or infant you are nearing the end of the process. Typically, the last thing that is done is being matched with a child. Often a biological mother chooses a family while she is still pregnant.|`|7JEojMgQaa	Future income for the agency.

After everything checks out, you get put on a waiting list and when a baby of the gender, nationality and so forth that you've chosen is available, the next person on the list gets that baby. Don't rule out adopting older children either.  Everyone wants a baby...  But I see nothing sadder than a 17 yr old kid about to be 18 and on their own, casted out into a world where no one knows them, no one cares about them.  I just wish we could find homes for all the children out there, or  at least sterilise those people who should never breed...|`|VMASMHX6aa	People who adopt 6 week old babies had already been through the process, before that baby was even born. They don't see the baby and decide they would like to adopt it!  It takes a few years to go through the vetting process. It can then take another year or so to be given a child.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	The major reason is supply and demand.  Too many people wanting to adopt vs the number of infants available for adoption.    A minor reason is the length of time it can take to be approved at a reputable agency.  Good agencies have lengthy screening processes that can take a year or more.    In our situation, 14 months passed from our first informational adoption meeting until we were approved.  Then there was the waiting time, which in our case was only two months.  (We were fortunate because our daughter had drug exposure issues and we were on a short list of people who were prepared to help her through.)|`|BTuFtui3aa	The process involves a lot more than just being matched with a child.    There are interviews, criminal background checks, homestudies, and in some cases training classes. All this would be before you were ever matched.    Also, there are long waiting lists for infants. It is estimated that there are 40 waiting families per 1 healthy newborn who becomes available. While it's true that there are children waiting for homes, the ones who wait for long periods of time are not healthy infants, but older children and special needs children. Infants are in enormous demand by families. If you actually want to help a child in need of a home, consider adoption from foster care.    At some agencies that match pre-birth (the are reasons this can be considered unethical, so please read up on this) the expectant mother chooses from the profiles of prospective adoptive parents, so you'd be waiting longer if you weren't immediately chosen by a mother.    Please do some serious research about the issues involved in adoption before you begin the process. It's pretty complicated, and it's really important to have an understanding of what it will be like, both for you and for your adopted child.|`|jHZqOuVEaa	It is estimated that for every available baby there are 40-100 couples looking to adopt.  So the wait is long due to low supply and high demand.  Now-a-days - most moms keep their babies rather than give them away.    There are thousands of older children available in foster care where the waiting time may be less.|`|Py1oiwYQaa	With domestic adoption the mom usually picks the adoptive parents. Most agencies don't have a list where you get the "next baby". So it takes several months to do the paperwork and background checks needed, and then you are waiting. There are more people waiting than there are babies. You can wait a week or you can wait three years - you just don't know. Most babies are placed at birth (our daughter came home from the hospital with us).    With foster care adoption it is similar if you want a baby, since there may not be many babies available for adoption, so there can be a long wait until you're matched with a baby. There are far more older children available for fost-adopt.|`|g09x06Zpaa	They start looking for a baby to adopt 1-3 years in advance. It doesnt matter what baby.  At the end of 3 years they get whatever 6 month old baby happens to be there|`|V67imGL8aa	It takes so long because there aren't a lot of babies available for adoption. You do your paperwork, and then you wait for someone to choose you. That's where the years come in.    Since you're thinking about adopting after you've had children of your own, I'm thinking you want to adopt to give a home to a child who needs one.  In that case, a three year waiting list would tell you that there's no shortage of homes for babies. There's a shortage of babies for people looking to adopt.    If you want to adopt a child that's most in need of a home, look at adopting older children, or adopting through foster care.
XPnCeJ29aa	I think the bananas are good..  Oh i also like the banana oatmeal, whenever he didnt finish it, I would lol how pathetic.    Any of the meat ones were absolutely beyond digusting.|`|a3cb80b66a772a6b621fcf095945a298aa	i love the bananas!!!|`|fHgbL046aa	I liked the fruit baby food,and mulipa cereal, but the meat baby food was nasty. My daughter went through a few jars of baby food. She had formula until 5 months old,  then hom* milk until 1 year and then she was on 2% milk. She was eating pieces of people food at 6 months. She didn't like the cereal either.  The formula and milk were my doctor's idea, but I know babies should be on formula until 1 year or breast fed. She was my doctor so I believed what she said.   I also believe I fed my daughter to many bottles of milk and didn't realize until much later. I'm 16 weeks pregnant and things will be different this time around.|`|YEqQZgs5aa	I love the jarred banannas by Gerber and my mil loves the peaches - we both eat them here n there (BUT my son is only 2 months so he isnt even eating "food" yet) ha ha ha  I cant wait to try some of it once he is...|`|WirFwirLaa	Beech Nut makes a great dessert in the Stage 2 foods called Dutch Apple Dessert. It taste just like dutch apple pie! I used to eat it all the time when my sister was a baby (she's 9 yrs. younger than me) My mom used to get so mad...haha! When my son started on Stage 2 foods I searched all over for it but I couldn't find it so I figured they stopped making it...Well last week I found it and even though my son is now 1 I still bought about a dozen jars of it! Haha!!!|`|Hr3zp1Jxaa	I love "Cerelac" its name of a child cereal|`|6cf9e01aaeb1f2746b20ce96afd525fdaa	I really liked the fruits and found my son did too... pea and such used to suck but i found mixing them with other food to hide the peas worked a treat... poor babies tho cos veggies for gerber ain't all that pleasant.. the gerber granola pots where good too i liked those|`|InZU5aaxaa	I use to eat baby food till I was fourteen. My little sister and I are over ten years apart. She would not eat her food from the jar unless I did. I love the bananas. Also regular apple sauce is an all time favorite. My little sister prefers a small bowl of apple sauce to ice cream.    I hated the dinners. As soon as she could eat big people food she would share a plate with me. She would never eat off of any one elses plate just mine.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I HATED the Gerber peas. Ick! They tasted like dirt and grass....    The yogurt is good, though, I have tried that. I also liked most of the fruits when he was on jar food. Now he eats table foods so I think most of those are good.|`|utfoP7GWaa	I think the gerber honey ham w/ pineapple is AWESOME!|`|AA11981363	Rice cereal is so yucky!! it tastes awful, I'm not surprised my daughter hated it the 1st time and I never offered it again.|`|zd6lRfIXaa	Haha, I used to put fruit baby food on toast. I think jelly is too sweet. I like the little puff finger foods and the Gerber yogurt drop things are so yummy!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I like most of the fruits and vegetables, but I took a bite of the "Earth's Best Turkey and Vegetable Dinner" last night and now I think I just can't feed that to my son anymore.  It was so gross.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I love the vanilla custard from gerber. The rice cereal with bananas smells good. All the fruits I've tried are pretty good: bananas, pears, applesauce....lol meat smeels groooooossss!!!!!|`|tmh42R6Caa	I've found that my child liked almost everything I gave him.  They don't have very refined taste buds, so I think it's all pretty bland to them.  The nutrients are much more important than the taste.  Once he/she is older, then you can worry about the taste :)|`|WxQFe0GYaa	I think rice cereal is so gross.  My son was never into it, so I haven't given it to him since we started on "real" food.  I make all my baby's food myself, so I think it all is really good!|`|80Zlwifsaa	I always thought the plums with tapioca was good. Most of the fruits are good. The vegetables and the stage three dinners like mac and cheese are so disgusting, after trying it out on my first child we just went with regular food cut up.    EDIT: The plums with tapioca is a gerber baby food, my oldest is almost 13 and my youngest is 5, and I did notice after my youngest it was hard to find so I don't know if they still make it or not. My sister and I used to buy it just to eat ourselves it was so good.
npkLIKPUaa	lmfao yep my sister is one of them especially with her baby boy xD  its funny my mom is like WTF?! he is fine even if its a simple little cough my sister is like omg we have to go to the doctors that sounded bad! i find it quite Amusing|`|gm5IE97uaa	well I am one of those "dramatic young mothers" I guess, considering that my son is my first child and I know nothing about raising a baby, I would think that it is fully understandable that I would freak out when a baby has a cold.  I mean, grown ups can take medicine for a cold and babies cant.  Fevers for babies are pretty dangerous and may often come with a common cold.  Congestion from a common cold can sometimes turn into pneumonia which is more often than not, fatal in babies if not caught in the nick of time.  It can also lead to ear infections which left untreated can cause a lot of problems.    So are young mothers being dramatic?  maybe, but will I as a new, young mother continue to be dramatic when it comes to my child's health, HELL YES!|`|staqho0Baa	I worked for a pediatrician so I have a little different perspective on this.  Yes people panic very easily and quickly over the common cold, even if their child has had it before or they have many children.  I have also seen a whole lot of parents who are oblivious and who's children should have either been in the ER or in a pediatricians office days ago and are very sick.  Its not just YOUNG mothers though, some of the people that worry the most are the OLDER mothers!  Its not a young or old thing, it is engrained in MOTHERS to MOTHER their children, to worry about their wellbeing.  Yes it can be annoying sometimes, but I would much rather a mother be a mother to her child than do nothing at all and let the child suffer!!|`|AA10167940	I agree.   Not only the ER, but  useless visits to PCP's as well-    Visits like that are also what drive up the cost of healthcare-    Common cold symptoms can easily be aleviated without the use of medications-|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	HAHA I am a young mother who has INSURANCE!!! yes I pay for it!  Surprised!?  I pay my taxes and I am not complaining about someone caring for their child...|`|xK6wehG7aa	apparently you don't have kids because you can't give a baby cough syrup until they're over 2 years old and they're currently trying to raise that age  to 6.    Also, what is wrong with a mother that is taking care of her child? And why do you assume young mother's are un-insured?     I am 22 and I have private insurance. If my son were sick in the middle of the night with a cold and he got a fever, I would probably take him to the E.R.     That doesn't make me dramatic, it makes me concerned. Would you rather mothers ignore it and let it develop into bronchitis or pneumonia?|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	ER? Tax payers? I'm not sure where you get your facts but I'd call my pediatrician before I went to the ER. Also what makes you think these mothers aren't tax payers? I'd rather see my tax dollars go to a mother taking care of her child than to support all these damn indians to get drunk on their reservations.... *I realize not all do this but where I live they do.    I think you opinion is under-developed and uneducated.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Tax payers? Many people have their own private insurance, buddy. And when BABIES get sick, especially newborns, it's usually not just a little cold. You're just being silly. I'd like to see you care for a newborn for the first time like a new mother would- by yourself. See if you can come up with a solution when they don't make cough syrup for little ones that young.   Now when the kids are older, yeah it's dumb to take the kids to the ER when it's obviously a cold and they could just give them cough syrup. That's usually not the case. I think most just schedule a doctor's appointment :)|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	well they don't give baby's cough syrup and if they have insurance it doesn't cost the tax payers- it costs the insurance who the mother is paying for. it's not just young mothers either. i took my son to urgent care for what *I* though was a cold but he was in daycare and i had to get him checked out- turned out he was diagnosed with pneumonia which was wrong, he had brochiolitis and had to have an inhaler and steroids.  my son had a fever of almost 104 later on that week. however, i don't take him for everything. when he does have a cold or a stomach bug he's at home|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	i suppose you were never a parent who was concerned about your son or daughter. And why do you care I have private insurance on my daughter and pay for all her visits to the dr & emergency room!!!!!|`|o2YHnKXiaa	Wow seriously come on now, I can understand what others are saying because I am a first time mother and I am worried about my son too even when he gets a cold. And I also have private insurance and pay for all his visits now too so why are you coming on here starting s***?|`|AA11981363	well, that only shows how good moms they are. I think it is only normal to feel a bit worried about your baby being sick, and I see nothing wrong with that.     Plus, did you know you can't medicate a baby?? baby needs to be seen by a doctor and have a prescription, it's not like you can go grab any OTC medicine. Moms must have the right dose according to baby's weight etc.    I think there are way much more thing that cost more to the tax payers. I really don't care, it is my baby's health.|`|iZDsMCghaa	Young mothers or maybe you meant to say some new moms? I was a young mom and I,myself didnt have any of my kids in the ER just to be handed cough syrup but I do think it may be a common thing amongst scared new moms who second guess themselves but better to be on the safe side, right?    As for tax dollars, we dont have to pay unless the people are uninsured or have state insurance, in which case, yeah, thats a bit aggravating.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	ok either you are a father who just doesn't get it or you are someone without kids. It's NOT young mothers who get upset it tends to be first time mothers. And how can you blame them? When you have a baby (especially for the first time) and you aren't quite sure what to do it's much better to be safe then sorry. Not to mention if these 'dramatic young mothers' didn't get so worried about their kids and take care of them then they would be bad mothers. get a clue  and by the way sometimes even us taxpaying mothers have to take their kids to the er because the Dr gives you a bunch of crap about doing what your doing then your kid gets more sick. what about when a DR won't help. where are mothers supposed to go then?|`|pDRAciBnaa	well your totally clueless or thick,babies cannot take cough syrup,any medicine they can take WE have to purchase!!    research your statement before you rant!!|`|wzXJOSIeaa	You wouldn't know because you aren't a mother!  And kids can't have cough syrup until their two if you were a parent you would know that.|`|LvywvZSeaa	Just YOUNG mothers? i think you should rephrase this and say "new" mothers. Yes, we do tend to overreact sometimes, but I think that is normal...we are concerned for our chilren, and want to make sure everything is ok...we don't always know that it is just a cold. A cold in a newborn is scary. I agree, we shouldn't run to the ER every time our babies sneeze (that is what doctors offices are for), but you shouldn't attack those of us who would rather be safe than sorry.|`|P25GuvNjaa	Yes, its crazy!  Its not just young mothers though, my husbands family all want to know why my son hasn't been rushed to the doctors when he gets the cold, his sisters two are regulars at the doctors and they get all annoyed when the doctor tells them its just a cold or a virus and don't give them medicine, perhaps they should be given placebos!|`|UXhFcHCHaa	first of all babies arent supposed to have OTC meds, so when a 4 month old gets sick you dont know what to do. You can only do the home remedies like humidfier, suction boogies, baby rub, steam. since you probably arent a parent and never had to hear you baby have  a cough that makes them cry or a stomach virus that includes a rash so you cant relate. i pay my taxes and work very hard so why does it matter if my son goes to the dr or er?|`|AA10063059	yes i have noticed on here how everyone panics and insists they take baby to ER now,but then i blame the break down of the family unit,young mothers do not seem to have anyone with experience to help them anymore,and if anything is wrong seriously you cant put life on rewind like a video
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Hmm...it depends. Maybe if they were on my contacts list. LOL    I picture a huge fight at the grill over who is breastfeeding and who isn't. Then maybe over by the drinks there would be another outburst over epidurals versus natural births. And someone might get their face smashed into the cake because they piped up that formula was just as good as breastmilk.     So, I might attend if I could wear a large raincoat to dodge all the food from the food fight at the end. Des would be up in the nearest tree zooming in with a camera capturing all the action shots. Then the illicit video would show up on YouTube and expose us all!     LMAO|`|fdnbXfvfaa	No, because even though you meet a lot of nice people here, you can come across some of the biggest back stabbers I have ever seen.  People get really defensive about their parenting skills, here, and if you will go mad at someone giving you a thumbs down on here, what would some people do if their parenting skills got  insulted to their face.|`|qSmCA82Aaa	Of course I would!  I would love to meet my contacts in person!    (I might like to ring a few necks too!  But you know those people wouldn't show up anyway,lol)|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I'd go to the one smile was hosting.  she put me in charge of the list of who was allowed to come.  :-)      EDIT - fights - spanking, circumcision, and abortion|`|Emc2XOJWaa	ah, maybe not...  I would probably be the person parked across the street with my daughter in the backseat, watching with a pair of binoculars to see if it was safe :p|`|3WWHWsHOaa	I would definately attend. There are several Trolls I would love to meet.    The biggest catalyst would be the troll bashing. Grandma and the spanking trolls would be running scared within seconds.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	lol.  no.  but i'd watch the replay on network tv when the fights started breaking out.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Sure!  Regardless of any fights that may ensue, there are people I'd love to meet in person :)    Oh boy, I'm not sure what the biggest catalyst would be!  Too many to choose from, lol.  But I agree with the trolls vs. the regulars and some of the other hot topics that stay@homemomma listed.  I'll add the child harness and lead debate to that!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	No, I don't allow internet people around my daughter. Imagine how many child molesters use the parenting section, and how many weirdos post diaper fetish questions here, and all the weirdos who are looking for sex with lactating women. Ugh. Nope.    I'll hang out with my local mommy friends. Much safer. I know their last names and I know where they live. If something went down my husband could give their REAL info to the police.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I would.     I think it would be a blast! :)|`|lkhCeAdJaa	I would go......  **you all like my new groupie?**   lol
c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	Lilah is 6 months old and ever since she was about 2 months we have done a footed sleeper and a light halo sleep sack.  I also keep my house at about 70-72.  She seems very comfortable.  =)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I think there's a big difference in that material the sleeper is made out of.  One night I had to change my son's pjs in the middle of the night because he was fussy and sweating in a fleece sleeper.  So now, since we do keep his room nice and warm, I make sure that he goes to bed in something made of terry or thick cotton but not thick and fleecy.|`|33h5R8nTaa	It all depends, my daughter is 7 months and usually put her in the footed ones from carters that are thick. we also keep our house at 70 and nome nights she gets hot and some she is cold. if we know its going to be hot we put her in a short sleve onie and footed PJ pants.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	We do the footed sleepers as well.  Sometimes, I have my daughter in fleece or terrycloth but only when it's particularly cold.  If you were worried about covering your baby, you could try a footless pajama.  You could also try a small fan in the room or a cool mist humidifier.|`|SONLm2Ilaa	She most likely is hot... 70 degrees is a little high with having sleepers and most likely a blanket as well! Drs say babys sleep most confortable when treated just like adults so turn your thermo down to 60 or 65 when you go to bed and keep her in a sleeper and cover her with a blanket! 70 degrees is a bit much, I don't know how you get any sleep!|`|d5707a466bbd84ff9d6588fbd5cda26aaa	i would turn the heater down to 65 and just keep dressing her warm. it may be too warm and could cause stuffy noses.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	At 4 months we just did the footed sleepers.  We still do them now, but we use the thicker soft ones as she moves around a lot.  If she seems hot you could buy the thinner sleepers.|`|5DfSfyWfaa	We do the footed sleepers too. I also got him a flannel crib sheet that seems softer and stays warmer in the winter.|`|49nm71oCaa	my son is 4 months old as well and he always sleeps in footed sleepers. i used to think it was too cold for him at 70 so id put socks on as well. he would be restless some nights, so i took the socks off and he was fine. i think you should continue to use what your using or maybe turn it down a degree or 2. now we keep the house at 68 and i find he sleeps and breathes better.|`|5rFua92paa	we keep our home fairly warm so my daughter sleeps in thinner cotton sleepers and has done well with that. Being in Texas, it isn't super cold anyway! We do have flannel sheets on her bed as well.
796de2a4227333484ebac3deccc1937eaa	I'm literally crying after reading this story! In the past two days alone I've heard more stories of people attacking and killing their own children that I think I might burst! A man in my state was just arrested yesterday for attacking and beating his 6 WEEK OLD DAUGHTER! She's now in the hospital with fractured ribs and skull in critical condition! Then the information on the trial for the mother of the little girl found in a tote in the ocean they named "Baby Grace". The girl was beaten because she didnt say please and yes sir and as she was being tortured she cried out, "Mommy! I love you!" She cried out to her mother while she beat her child to death. It breaks my heart in every way possible!    The poor little girl barely survived the fall only to die later in the hospital!  I can't imagine why parents decide to kill their own children. I don't understand HOW they can do it. How can they look at their precious children who have nothing but unconditional love for their parents, and just take their life away? It's horrible and it's sickening! I literally feel nauseous after hearing of these types of stories.    I know that little girl's soul is in safe and loving hands now. She is at peace. I pray for those two little boys who witnessed this tragedy! They will forever carry pain from this day. If the mother is innocent (so far they haven't mentioned her) then my heart breaks for her as well.     What is this world coming too? There are so many great people out there who can't have children but yet these monsters have them! It really doesn't seem right.    Brit|`|FvYqKZSMaa	That is so sad.I can not imagine anyone doing that to their child.Some parents should not be parents.He should not take it out on a child.It is not her fault.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	your link doesn't work.  but what i think should happen to parents who kill their own children is that they should get psychological help if appropriate and otherwise be put in prison where they cannot hurt anyone else.  there's a lot wrong with the world, but wishing torture on the wrongdoers to me just seems to be contributing to those wrongs.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	The link doesn't work.  But yes, its very horibble :(|`|o2YHnKXiaa	That is so horrific I would hang him off a bridge himself, But that little girl is okay and that's all that matters what the hell was he thinking? I don't understand what the hell goes through some people's minds when this s*** happens. There is a lot that is wrong with this world and half the s*** that happens we will never figure out! My prayers go out to that little girl :)|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	The link is bad... but yes if you kill your child you need to die a slow and painful death... or maybe die the same way you killed your child...except slower and mor painful.|`|gHIEbYM9aa	Hmm...... The link worked for me and that is soooo stupid!!!!!!!!!   Why would anyone do that do u think the mother new about that??  That is just horrible and cruel|`|r07BwhO1aa	There is no punishment in the world to fit this crime, if I had my way I would not put him to his death, I would put him in a room with pictures of his little child surrounding him and have a loud speaker blasting children laughing and playing 24/7 so he can go insane!!  Then I would let the biggest toughest guy in the joint who lost his child because he got locked up "befriend" him for a while!!|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Your link didn't work for me, but I am assuming your talking about the crazy twit who threw his 4yo off the bridge in Melbourne, Australia?    You have to think WTF runs through their minds.|`|iSJFWFFkaa	too many things wrong with this world to even count.|`|r9gBoBLCaa	I know. It's disgusting. From what they have said after he did it, the man was supposedly suicidal, hysterical, etc. You can't help but wonder what the hell happened? What went through his mind? Or is he just acting all the hysteria so he doesn't have to talk to police yet, and has time to think up a cover story? - You'd think anyone capable of doing this to a child, doesn't have the mental ability to think about what they're doing, even after they've done it. Makes no sense to me. I am interested in what he has to say.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	I cabn't hear anymore stories like this...it's too much.  Why do so many innocent babies have to die at the hands of their own parents?      I hope he burns in hell!
0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	I make most of my calls during nap time. I use my answering machine a lot as well. I have a schedule that my clients are informed of and I let them know upfront, not to expect me at a moments notice. And, to only call during my set work hours. Sometimes, I have any occasional rule break, but I let it hit the machine first and then return it at my leisure.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I don't really know.  I do work from home sometimes, but don't have to deal with anyone outside of my company, and most of our conversations are via email or IM.      Does your 17mo have any other quiet times during the day?  Snack time?  Baby Einstein time?|`|TQW5E6olaa	That's a good one! When I'm at home I'm doing emails and internet based systems, I don't have to talk to anyone important, just my office people and they understand.    Hmm. Sound proof bubble?|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I shut down my business in my daughters first year. Prior to that I worked when my son was at school. Baby and my business was to much. I didn't feel I was doing right by either of them so I shut it down.|`|AA10494763	Well i work from home sometimes.  (I am out seeing clients two or three days a week and instead of going back to the office i go home and wrap up the day)  I honestly check my voice mail then go in my bedroom and close the door so that i can return calls.  We have a 6 month old and  2 year old.  I make sure they are fed and taken care of and the older one has a movie on the TV.  Then i check on them between calls.     I am nervous because my job is moving to all work from home in the next year or two and i will be home on my office days.  This works now because it is just two hours in the afternoon. I don't know what i will do when i am home all day making and returning calls|`|T3BXC8qXaa	I made calls during nap time and I hired a pre-teen "mothers helper" to come over after school. She was able to entertain the baby in another room while I made calls. This accomplished two things. I was able to get my work done and she learned how to be comfortable with the baby and his routines (I only had one at the time). She later became a very reliable babysitter!|`|j2mRop0laa	I had an important call yesterday with a volunteer organization that I'm with and my oldest BURSTS through the door screaming "SHE SCRATCHED MY CAMERA!!!" and my youngest is running right behind her screaming "IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!!! I DIDN'T DO IT PURPOSE!!"     Humiliation. That's how I get things done, apparently.
be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I woke up at 4 in the morning in labor. But the day before I felt really crampy, no appetite, sore lower back and really emotional. I couldn't sleep well either.    I was 3 days before my due date.|`|E2h4QuxKaa	I was enduced with both of my girls on their due date, and to be honest I felt like pooooooh.  LOL.  It's the best feeling in the world tho when it's over, you'll love it and learn to appreciate every second of all you had to go thru some day :o)|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	On the Tuesday I felt absolutely fine - I was getting my bloody show but other than that I felt like "normal". My labour started at 3:30am Wednesday 14th with very irregular back contractions. They continued throughout the whole day, into the night when I went into hospital at 4am on Thursday 15th. I had her at 3:45pm that afternoon :)  I was 39 weeks 3 days on Wednesday, 39 weeks 4 days when I delivered.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	GREAT:) i had the best sleep i had in a long time. the night before i had horrid back pain. soon after i woke up my water broke|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I felt perfectly fine up until the moment i got to the hospital and they put me on pitocin to bring on contractions.  My water had broke several hours earlier and i wasn't contracting so that's why they gave it to me.  My daughter was born at 38 weeks.|`|jQDeTTVhaa	I was a wk late and was getting induced.I was very excited to meet my son.I didn't even really focus on the pain b/c I thought of everything that changes after he is born.I am now 40wks today with my daughter and she might be late just like her brother.I am excited once again.|`|v3LnJycKaa	EXHAUSTED, the night before my scheduled induction I got a call from my sister/aunt/dad telling me my grandfather was in the hospital, he had a sezuire in his sleep the night before which caused an anuersysm to burst and left him brain dead, we rushed to the ICU for last rights etc... they pulled the plug about 4 hours after we were there... he continued through the night and sadly passed the morning my daughter was born.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? 1st child, was an emergency c-section at 37 weeks along, my 2nd child was a planned c-section at 39 weeks.. So I didn't have any labor.|`|dURFX4gOaa	i was nearly 2 weeks late and i felt like someone was punching my back with a sledgehammer ( my daughter was back to back and stubborn ) but once she was born 12 horrible hours later i felt like the luckiest women alive she was Truly Beautiful and still is i can wait to do it all over again lol|`|3SIRKIBaaa	Well that Friday I felt pretty good. I did a LONG walk and felt a little energized. That night I went into labor but I didn't dilate far enough for them to admit me so I was sent back home. Saturday was HORRIBLE. I was in so much pain and they gave me these pills to help with the contractions but it only  made me drowsy. As soon as I got another contraction I woke right up. Sunday I was FINALLY admitted into the hospital (thank God) and as soon as they gave me the epidural the rest of my labor was beautiful. :) And I was late...specifically by 3 days. Good luck and congratulations!|`|zuZKj3xXaa	i went into false labor last night :( im dilated to 2, i had a tummy ache. other than that i was Fine...im leaking amniotic fluid Very Slowly :( being monitored...Long Laboring :( cant wait tho!! a lot of women feel Normal until their Water breaks, then all hell breaks loose! lol obviously i was Early...didn't actually have her "yet" maybe anytime, but im preparing for the labor..:) were pretty close with our dute dates, pretty awesome lol      36 weeks with a baby GIRL!|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	Two days before I always cleaned my house from top to bottom. I always got a "second wind" and went crazy with the cleaning. On the day I went into labor I just felt really lazy and rested a lot.|`|dprURFLxaa	First child was induced so it wasn't natural.  The second one I went into labor around 3am the morning after my due date.  I kept having weird cramps and tried to go back to sleep.  About 5:30am I finally decided that I was actually in labor and woke up my husband.  About 7am we left for the hospital and I was definitely in labor.  9am we checked in and our son was born at 1:37pm.  That's how it happened.  I felt happy that this huge child was finally out of me!  LOL.|`|de641317a0696a8d53df9d1538305a2baa	Okay, the day before I went into labor (6 days early) I has a bit hunched over with a cramp.  I simply could not straighten up.  My co-workers were laughing at me, saying I was in labor.  I insisted I wasn't in labor.  (I must have been in the early stages of labor.)  The whole day, too, I was HUNGRY.  I was stuffing down food left and right.  I had a FULL breakfast at a diner, then Chinese food for lunch, and more Chinese food for dinner.  I was still a bit crampy, but okay.  I had several bowel movements (probably the body prepping me for what lay ahead), and I was very tired and went to bed at 9:30pm.   At 1:30am I shot straight up in bed and I KNEW I was in labor.  Time to start timing the contractions!  Good luck with your baby!!!!|`|XZxNQSlVaa	completely normal. well normal for a full term pregnant lady.    The first sign was something that came out when I peed in a bathroom like I was starting my period. The next time I went a little more cam out and then contractions started every 7 minutes and shortly after that they were 1-5 minutes apart and unfortunately this went on for about 48 hours before my baby was born one week before his due date.|`|7d632fbyaa	well I have 3 kids and every pregnancy is different. my 8 her birth was 7/24/ but she came 1 week late she came 8/3/. She wa my first baby I felt like someone drop a tuck in my back and. My middle child they told me her birth was 5/27/ and she came 5/18.  only with my son the due date was right they told me 8/20/ and I deliver him  8/20. some times doctors are not quiet sure the due date of the baby. GOOOOOOOOOD LUCK MY FRIEND TAKE CARE
vzDmaWqaaa	you can put him in the crib whenever you are comfortable but if he is not able to control his body weight yet you will need a special wedge like crib sleeper.  These have a wedge on each side of the baby that keeps him from rolling over. this is important because it helps him not to get stuck on his stomach and have trouble breathing.  what I did with my daughter was i kept her in the bassinet next to my bed until she was big enough to start to roll when she needed a little more space I brought the crib into our room so I could still hear her when she needed me.  i moved her bed into her room when she started sleeping closer to 8 hours a night. Hope this helps.  Good Luck and Congratulations!|`|XOtHsTo0aa	I put all 3 of my kids in theirs at 8 weeks.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Whatever works for you.  My daughter slept at night in a bassinet by our bed for the first 6 weeks, but napped in her crib from birth.      If baby is still waking often for night feeds, it's more convenient for everyone to keep him in your room until he's sleeping longer.  But if he's already sleeping much of the night, or you dont' mind walking down the hall as often as needed, he can sleep in a crib in his room tomorrow.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	My daughter was in the crib from the day she came home from the hospital....so 2 days old.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	he was 2 months for naps and 3 months for nighttime.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	You can put him in as soon as you get it. My daughter went into her crib from the very first night we got back fromt he hospital. We shared a room then so I was right there. But when my new baby is born I'll probably keep her in the bassinet by our bed until she sleeps through the night, then start letting her sleep in the crib. You could try it out right away and see if it works for you! No harm in it.|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	you can keep the baby in the bassinet until he can roll over if you like but both of my children where in the crib the day they came home from the hospital.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	My son is almost 4 months and still in his bassinet.  I guess it decides on the family and what works best for you guys.|`|o2YHnKXiaa	I also had a bassinet and my son slept in there till he was 2 months old and than moved to his own crib, he transitioned just fine. It all depends on when you feel it's right.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	My son was about a week old when we moved him to his crib. It just depends on what you are comfortable with.|`|ncpl2ruzaa	I kept my son next to us in our room in a bassinet until he was about 1-2 months old then he was in his own crib from then on. Good luck|`|GLdNx5Bfaa	my daughter when in here bed when she was3 mounts|`|UXhFcHCHaa	i moved him at 3months because then he started waking up just once a night not every 2 hours to eat. you do it when you are ready. if you want him to sleep in the pack in play till he 6 months then go for it just make sure he doesnt have the weight limit which i think is 15 pounds|`|HvALvdc7aa	My Daughter will be 8 weeks tomorrow and still won't sleep in her crib. She has a portable crib she likes to play in but she won't sleep in it. If she does its only for about 20 minutes. If he sleeps in his bassinet now switching to the crib shouldn't be a problem. Wish my daughter would. But Im not for the crying it out thing, so I'll let her sleep where she wants for now. Im gonna try the crib again in a few weeks. Good Luck.|`|jVhWIDRnaa	Taylor was about six weeks when we put her in her crib. She loves it and absolutely hated her bassinet.     I think you can put them in their crib whenever you are comfortable doing so. Some people do it right away, some wait until they are older.     I kept her in my room for the first six because she seemed to little to be in her own room.|`|5DfSfyWfaa	4 months. I would say that if you feel comfortable enough do it right away. It'll be easier when he's younger.|`|Ka52nbhNaa	Our twins were in their cribs from when they came home from the hospital.  We did not have room in our bedroom for 2 bassinetts and their room is just 10 feet from ours (we can see into their room with the doors open) so it worked best for us.    Your little one will do fine - it may take some time to get him adjusted but you can move him whenever you want or whenever he outgrows the bassinet.    Best wishes!|`|UV5htpg3aa	my son went in a crib as soon as we brought him home from the hospital
lcNPeZOeaa	i've heard my nephews snore really loud and they're still very small. i guess it's pretty normal. according to psychological studies, snoring is considered as a sign of COMPLETE relaxation. but u should probably consult your family doctor once about this otherwise you'll keep on worrying about this like all mothers!  cheers|`|cAtWxJG1aa	our kids snore and we asked the pediatrician about it.  obviously ask yours when you're in for a checkup.  but ours said not to worry unless they were occasionally gasping when they did it or if they were very tired or having behavioral problems during the day, in which case they needed to be evaluated for sleep apnea.|`|ZgBczgIMaa	Well, sure it is. But she might have some allergies and her nose might be clogged!|`|iSJFWFFkaa	have him checked out by a doctor.  i always err on the side of caution.|`|I13UuI9faa	My now 18 yr old son went through this, and boy could he snore!!  :)  He also had very few colds and or tonsil problems, except for enlarged tonsils. The doctors decided to remove them and didn't snore half as bad as he did before surgery.( also had adnoids removed which can play a part in the snoring.) Ask your sons doctor about this it might be what is needed. Good Luck!|`|704a9b663dde5b477a175b8c2de5bf9daa	check his adenoids out!
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    Your doing well with what you've said.  With help trying to conceive laying down for 2-30 minutes after having sex with a pillow under your bum helps the sperm work there way to the egg.  Deep penetration when the man ejaculates helps the sperm be closer to the cervix.  Having regular sex every other day keep the sperm healthy, and keeps a high count. They say having sex every day tires the sperm out and is more of a chance of a low count.    Hope this information helps.  Best of luck xx|`|Jhkoz18Xaa	There are many things you can do to improve your chances getting pregnant including finding our more about your fertile days, taking the right vitamins, losing weight, etc.  Read more below.....
AA10300476	Yes, I'm exhausted. Sometimes I want to come home during my planning period and go to sleep since I only live a couple of minutes from the school where I work. As soon as I get home, I'm stretching out on the couch for a nap! I can't help it. If I take a nap of about an hour or so, I wake up thinking I can't wait to go to bed so I can sleep all night. I used to be a night owl, too. I had changed some because I don't work at night anymore, but now I can't stay up late for anything in the world. On Saturdays, I just want to stay in bed all day. I think if I didn't have a 7 year old, I would. If I go to bed at 9pm, I'm up at about 2am and can't go back to sleep, so if I get a nap, I usually make myself stay up until about 10:30 or 11. I don't know how long it lasts, but I told my husband I'm tired of being attacked by the Sleep Monster every day. LOL|`|2B2fgmw9aa	very very normal!! Your body is, after all, creating another human life!    I am normally a night owl, and I nap throughout the day and still go to bed by 10-11pm! I do have energy spurts here and there, but ia am pretty much tired all the time.|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	With my first I was dog-tired for the first 12 weeks or so. With my second I felt like I was dying from some sleeping disease, the entire pregnancy. With my 3rd I was tired the first and last trimester but felt great in the am. With this my fourth I felt like the living dead for the first 10 weeks. It feels horrible, like if you can't lay down you might just drop over dead you're so tired.|`|ejNJk9J8aa	It is perfectly normal. Remember your body now has to do more work because it needs to provide for another person inside you. so your heart and lungs and everything is working double shift right now. The more rest you take the better for your body. feeling sleeping is just your body's way of telling you that you need to take a rest. So good luck and don't worry too much. If you still feel unsure ask your doctor about it. He/She will be able to tell you in more details.|`|rXMSK2B6aa	I was the same way but I couldn't even make it till 9p.m., I would go to bed as early as 7p.m., I am almost 20 weeks and I still go to bed early now, not as early as 7 but usually around 9.      Congratulations on your pregnancy!!|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I slept 12 hour days when I was pregnant and I still haven't caught up on my sleep. lol    Snoring is also normal and once I snored so loud I woke myself scared.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	It's very common to be fatigued in early pregnancy, and then again at the end of your pregnancy.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	It is very common, mine went away during the second trimester but it also has came back in the third trimester. Just sleep whenever you can your body needs it.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	im around 32 wks and im still so tired it didnt really get better for me  its not as bad as the start but defo still strong|`|8VCGdvZGaa	For me, there was a 3 week period around my 2nd month when I was EXTREMELY tired all of the time.  After that, I noticed a big change in my energy level for the better.  Don't worry, it doesn't last your entire pregnancy.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Its completely normal. Yesterday I slept allllll day and I went from being and insomniac to falling asleep from putting my head on the pillow. I can just sit and rest my head on something and I will fall asleep. Dont worry its perfectly normal.|`|W0d6NsGBaa	Yes! Your body is very busy! Being tired is EXTREMELY normal!! Don't worry....it only lasts for about 18-21 years :-)|`|WsUSAgLmaa	9 months, lol    I was really tired alot early in my pregnancy and keep just falling asleep. Now Im not as tired and Im 27 weeks but i try to prevent myself from taking naps because then my stomach usually feels upset. Hang in there you will be fine shortly.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	It is normal. I can sleep 12 hrs eat something and go right back to sleep for a couple of more hrs.|`|AA12324049	You didn't specify how far along you are but it is very common to be tired during the first trimester.  The second trimester is usually the best - you're not that big, morning sickness has usually subsided or decreased, and you have more energy.  The last trimester is the hardest because you're tired carrying all the extra weight and you will have to pee all the time (at least I did!) because the baby puts pressure on your bladder.  Just take care of yourself and take your prenatal vitamins and you will be fine!|`|dDVAUA9saa	Totally normal during the first and last trimester.  For me, it lasted until about 14 or 15 weeks.|`|4KXA5oVtaa	Yes it's very normal, but sleepiness can be different for everyone and every pregnancy.  My first son I was only tired the first trimester and ready to go the rest of my pregnancy.  Now, I'm expecting my 2nd, (only a few more days to go, thank god :)) but have been very sleepy the entire pregnancy.  When I'm home and not at work I nap when my son naps, or sometimes, this sounds bad, drop him off at daycare so that I can slip in a nap if I need to.  I hope everything goes well for you!  Good luck!|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	I was so tired from about 6 weeks to about 12 weeks. It sucked because I would go to bed at 9 wake up at 7 & still be so tired. On the weekends I would have plans to do all sorts of stuff but I just slept all the time. But once I hit my 2nd trimester I was fine. I got a burst of energy.
7RQDM1HGaa	I was going to say that they sounded like names from a cartoon lol|`|heC9aQ18aa	I think the name Trik is better suited for a pet while the name Lindy sounds like it belongs to a child in 1830 and not 2030. Sorry. I don't really like them but I have no suggestions because I am not sure what type of names you are looking for. Sorry. Best of luck.|`|QBKzvw4faa	Sure.. sounds good.. I like Trip & Mindee.. but Trik & Lindy are cool too.. =).. good luck with your book..|`|TAufQoc7aa	how about trik and rindy? or something other than lindy|`|vOD4Urzdaa	I really like them both! Very sweet, and cute.|`|qxnxm0YLaa	How about Tique & Unique?!?!? (lol)
VKgD1K3baa	Although the doctors say that it does not run in families, my husband had colic for 6 months - lo and behold my almost 5 month old son is still dealing with it.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Possibly.  It depends on what was wrong with you.      In the past, all sorts of things were diagnosed as 'colic' -- allergies, reflux, gassiness.  It was expected that babies would cry a lot, so colic was just more of 'normal' crying.      Allergies DO run in families, so if you had allergies (to your formula, or to something in mom's diet if you were breastfed), there's a chance that your baby would have allergies too.      But 'colic' is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Nobody really  knows what colic IS -- it's just 'excessive crying that cannot be explained by any physical cause' ... so we can't know if it's genetic or not.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	maybe.. both hubby and I had colic and so did our son. we don't have any other children yet so we only have Jacob to go by.|`|KYOqsyWaaa	My mother says I was a colicky baby, and apparently my husband was very high-strung and difficult to handle too (he still is, lol).    Somehow we ended with a very calm, easy to soothe baby.  He never had colic or trouble getting to sleep or anything.    You might get lucky :)|`|OZ474DMYaa	yes or no. i was very colic when i was a baby and my husband wasn't. Our son wasn't at all. You never know. Its really the luck of the draw with that. Some babies get it when there is not history of it in the family.|`|p7ZdohGTaa	Colic can be managed in a couple different ways. Colic often means the the baby is having trouble with the digestion of some things in its diet. Even if the baby is breastfed, the mother may be eating something that is bothering the baby. I had to deal with this with my son (for much longer than a few months) and after my son got older, I found he had sensitivities to many foods. If I had understood this when he was a baby, it may have helped me. The things that can cause problems are, especially, wheat and dairy. So, if you are breastfeeding, you may try to forego products with wheat in them, as well as very sugary things. Watch dairy to see what happens. Giving a child/infant yogurt may also help and especially if you need to give the baby any antibiotics. You should really look up the following: diaper rash and candida, indigestion and candida, food sensitivities and candida. When I had my third child, I began having trouble with her, so this is what I did, and it helped immensely: I switched her formula (she was bottlefed as opposed to my first who was breastfed). I gave her 1/2 soy formula and 1/2 regular milk-based formula. Only one had iron in it, which can be very irritating to the stomach. Then, in addition to these things I did the following by doctor suggestion: While feeding my daughter, I held her with her back in an upright postion. I tipped her head back, but never let her back change from the 90 degree angle - upright. This allowed the formula to go right down, rather than air bubbles forming and causing problems. Between all these things, I had very little trouble with her from then, on. I will say, now that she is an adult (21), she has colitis. I suspect wheat and dairy, but as an adult she chooses to eat what she chooses and suffer the consequenses. The following things are suggested to be possibly aggravated by wheat or dairy: colitis, headaches (my other daughter), acne, adhd (my son), and other autoimmune diseases. Getting it under control as an infant may be very beneficial. Having a problem with some foods and with digestion can run in families, so reading up may be a benefit to you and your family.
EtCRnDJMaa	nothing wrong with that at all.  My girls love to stay in their PJ's all day for a day.  They play, watch TV,& have fun.  On weekends they wear sweats anyway, it's kind of the same thing.  I know a lot of people who do it too.  It's fun to on a snow day!!!  ENJOY!!!   and soak in the nice hot bathtub too, that will be even better.|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	my daughter and i have had pajama day every sunday for the last month because the weather has been miserable cold and snowing i saw no reason to leave the house. pajama day is fun for both of us, we read books and play with her baby dolls and anything else she wants to do. and the best part of pajama day is when she takes her nap i take one to!!! take the day off, there is no rule that says we have to get up and get dressed and clean the house everyday. let it go enjoy a day with your daughter!!!|`|wmBK9uASaa	Go for it and enjoy...|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Go for it.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	sure it's okay. have at it!

I do the same with my two youngest, boy who's 3 and girl who's nearly two. Like you said its not regular, but sometimes its nice to chill in your pj's. I'm sure she'll enjoy it too. Get a blanket so you can snuggle up with her. Hope you feel better soon.|`|mpc6aNvCaa	i did that yesterday kids didn't have school because of snow and even our 15 yrs joined in watch cartoons and play games and read they even napped some but it's fun my daughter wants to go to nana's house like that and have a tea party and pj day we will do that in the spring or summer. but have fun and enjoy.|`|op55FtqYaa	After being in labour with her for god-knows-how-many-hours you are entitled to a pyjama day!

62hGVNhoaa	I don't know if she is fake or not, but my 2nd child was born seconds after my waters broke, so that could be true.  In the UK (I don't know about anywhere else) so long as mum and baby are fine it is possible to leave hospital a few hours after birth or perhaps she had a home birth.  It is possible that she is pregnant again, not recommended to have sex for 6 weeks after giving birth but it is not impossible although I doubt she would know she was pregnant again this early.|`|i4ceTwqLaa	Why on earth do you care if she's telling the truth or not?    ***    Report them to WHO? The yahoo answers truth police????|`|LKbMSajFaa	Remove her from her friends then. if you think shes lying. you cant report her for this, you dont know her.|`|0WYzUsjMaa	post the link so we can see if she is lying or not|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	2 EX friends of mine pretend to be pregnant ALL the time. they are just jealous I can actually get and stay pregnant. some girls are like that.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	The soonest any reasonable doctor would let you out of the hospital after a birth is 12 hours.  Maybe she could have had a home birth?  You aren't supposed to have sex for at least 6 weeks after having a baby, but obviously there are plenty of people out there, myself included, who do not wait the full 6 weeks.  So her story is plausible, but it does sound odd, so it is quite possible she's lying about it all.  I don't think I'd report it, but maybe you can remove her as your contact?  I'm not shure if that is something you can do on face book but try it and see.  It'll save you some aggravation.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	I wouldn't worry about it too much. She's probably just looking for attention and giving it to her only satisfies her need. If she IS faking it then really she's just making herself look silly. But if you really feel the need to, you could ask her some simple questions to make her slip up like "which hospital were you at" and "how long were you in labour?" because a teen who doesn't really understand childbirth might slip up and say that she was only in labour for an hour, or that she went to a hospital that doesn't have a birthing/maternity ward. Personally I wouldn't waste the time trying to get her to slip up though.|`|55IMnlcwaa	She is lying. Hospitals generally keep you 2 days for vaginal birth if no complications, and 4 days for a c-section with no complications. Having your bag of waters rupture only happens in 15% of pregnancies, and it is usually a trickle which most women would not even recognize. You are said to wait 6 weeks before having sex, I waited 4 weeks because I had vaginal, no episiotomy, no tearing, and felt fine. This girl is obviously looking for attention. Don't waste your time reading her crap and delete her from your friends.
SF1uPJZhaa	Yeah, that's exactly the kind of name that always makes me cringe when someone asks about it on here.    Trendy, misspelled, made-up, excessive use of Ys and E-sounds. Yuck. That poor boy.|`|uQyrxxmIaa	Its unique and different but im not sure i like it.   As long as the mother and father like it then that is all that matters, & the child will get used to it!|`|M3k9GOSsaa	Very interesting name. I think that it has some character to it, just like any other Hollywood baby name. He will fit right in with Jason Lee's son Pilot Inspektor. Believe me, worse names out there.    Honestly, I think it rocks!|`|AA11626328	How do you say that first name...|`|ttxxBuODaa	That is such a beautiful name, my opinion is coming from my heart. ^_^|`|AjwXFXiVaa	I like uncommon names but I don't really care for these.|`|UJaCObdyaa	I LOVE it.    I would have spelt it differently though.    Draven Kingslee Martin.      But other than that 10/10.
wl7tlYOYaa	Its normal for how many weeks u are. They could give u another sono in a week and u will see a big difference in size thats why the usually wait til ur at least 8 weeks to do a sonogram.|`|AA10727113	That sounds perfectly normal.  Babies at first seem to look like little shrimp or tadpoles.  The next ultrasound will show more human features.  Congrats|`|azrKKNfTaa	that is what they look like for a while then it will kind of look like a chicken then an alien and finally your beautiful baby but it takes a while
wl7tlYOYaa	I think u just went in too early like the woman said its hard enough to pick it up at 8 weeks and trust me a couple of days makes a big difference. No a sac with a black dot is pretty normal for the amount of weeks ur along. I had one at 8 weeks then another 1 at 9 weeks and boy a week makes a huge difference in the second one u can see the babys hands and everything. I wouldnt worry about it wait til the next scan then they should tell u the heartbeat and measurements.|`|dn2UCOkqaa	No you are perfectly alright. Yes thats the better. She will be able to properly date you when you come back because the baby will be bigger
CJqK40uFaa	i think its beautifull....middle name Addiktion..|`|YYAu9lFDaa	nicotine is a gum/patch that helps you quit smoking.  if you're going to live in the US i highly discourage it.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	I wouldnt use that name, it has a very beautiful meaning but everybody is going to associate her name with cigarettes but its still up to you name her whatever you want to.|`|AA10119874	It's what is in cigarette in my culture.  Bad choice here.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Slappy that is an ingredient in cigarettes in my culture.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	yes, another great on to add to my list!!|`|7RQDM1HGaa	Well it means an 'Addictive Drug' in our culture. Don't do it.|`|gdnL63ngaa	yeah depends where you live.  When I hear that i think of "dirty, chemicals, gross, smelly"|`|TAufQoc7aa	I prefer Knicker-teen spelling. it looks better|`|vOD4Urzdaa	Not here. Maybe use part of the name like Nicola or Tina.
9kdUmttPaa	I like Katya. How do you pronounce Ksenija?|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	Katya is cool the 1st one is weird|`|n3IoftMFaa	They are nice names for a puppy.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	Love Katya  Not fond of Ksenija.|`|AA11206135	I don't particularly like either one.. They sound ethnically specific and borderline made up.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	Sorry but I don't like them|`|xZG0q6vXaa	I'm in southeast USA    Sorry to say I can't pronounce the first name|`|em6Sm8zcaa	I like Katya.  But also, its nice when you name your pet, its a name that can describe your pet, like marsh mellow, it sounds so cuddly!  But I like Katya best!|`|GrazcjGXaa	The name Katya has slav origin, used in Russa, former USSR countries, Bulgaria, Serbija.  There is slav name similar to Ksenija, it is Aksenija, not sure bout Akseija tho.|`|bnEQozqZaa	i like the name katya but never heard of ksenija|`|uLQIXyMMaa	I think the teachers at playschool will hate you -  also you will never get a mug with the names on!
R9mQNOCnaa	Don't get nervous but go to the doctor.You could be in prelabor.37weeks is almost full term.You should not have any cramping at all...Contractions feel more like a vice grip and it hurts but not like a cramp.Sounds like your baby is ready for his/her  debut.Stay calm but call your doctor.|`|FplTPoAyaa	Your belly may be stretching a bit, or possibly you are just getting more uncomfortable as it gets closer to your due date.  I don't recall having a warm sensation, but all women are different.  If you are having contractions, you will know it. It is unlike any pain you have ever experienced.  And yes, your belly will harden during a contraction.  Good luck to you !
AA10715129	maybe he is going by the heart rate. There is a old wives tale that says if the baby has a high heart rate it's a girl and a low heart rate is a boy. But I know for a fact that is b.s because my baby has always had a high heart rate and he is definetly a boy. :(|`|q51cevqLaa	Whoa.  Way too early to tell.  Get a new doctor.  If this guy is telling you this, you certainly don't want him to be around if something goes wrong.  You can tell the sex of the baby around 18-20 weeks|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	Unless you had an ultrasound to determine the sex then the Dr cannot know for certain. Even ultrasounds can be wrong.  I had an older Dr with my second. He was the best Dr ever. They do tend to guess though. He would always say..."It sounds like a girl" ...just by the heartbeat. It was a boy!|`|xH3cIAuxaa	I think you can tell by AFP or amnio, but unlikely you've had one of those this early...and if he is going by heart rate then he is  a moron, that is an old wives tale...maybe you need to ask why he says that and if he gives you some crazy answer than look for a new doc!|`|wl7tlYOYaa	yea wayyy to ealry to tell the sex he is just probably going by the heart rate older doctors tend to do that it doesnt mean he doesnt know what he is talking about on the contrary he probably knows alot because he has alot of experience. He just believes an old wives tales cut him so slack he is only human.|`|v3LnJycKaa	i don't know i know that my dr is a wonderful older man, but he will joke all the time in early pregnancy (this is my 3rd with him so we do have a Rapport) but by heart rate etc he will say oh i think this one is a___ and it just gives me hope, as him what he is basis his guess on.
P7tue78Aaa	I have the exact same problem! Yes! I started getting the same symptoms as you around week 5. Tomorrow I will be in week 9. I am constantly hungry. It has actually gotten worse. I now have to wake up around 5 to 6 in the morning to go get something to eat. What I recommend is eating smaller (on the healthy side) meals/snacks. I never eat three big meals. Saltines have been great when I don't really feel like eating, but my stomach is making me. Also, try to avoid lots of sugar if possible. I have found that those snacks don't keep me full long at all and I only end up wanting more. High protein foods are also good because they will keep you full longer.    The peeing often is normal too. I did the same thing but I also upped my fluid intake when I found out I was pregnant. I have never had to wake up to pee in the middle of the night, but I do now. So relax! I think it's normal. I have always had a high metabolism but I think pregnancy kicked in into 'overdrive'!!|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Its normal. Some women just experience symptoms earlier than others. I started my stuff before I found out I was pregnant and I found at 6 weeks so it happens.|`|TljXiSNnaa	oooo yes hunny i had increased peeing at that time especially when it was sleepy time i still wake up at least three times a night and i am 11 weeks.....and i was really hungry also. it stayed that way until i was about 8 weeks and then the morning sickness started and i didnt want to eat anything!!! lol good luck|`|azrKKNfTaa	i didnt notice and increase in peeing till much later on but a lot of women do. the appetite thing is exactly where i was i was famished all the time. until about 10 weeks then i was never hungry at all  congrats|`|buoqtZeFaa	I think that is normal even though everyone is different.  I know before I found out I was pregnant (found out right about six weeks) I felt like I was hungry all the time, peeing like crazy, and could not stay up past ten o'clock.      Good luck and congratulations!
b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	Oh I remember those days! You could sew on 100 buttons, even to spell out the school and "100 days". You could use the puff paint and put 100 dots on it. If you want to get really fancy you could put a picture on the shirt of their class or something to represent the school year so far. Make sure to put the year on it too if you want them to have it as a keepsake.    You could also get those iron press pictures to put on it from the craft section in walmart (or any craft store). You could also get those foamy pieces and have the kids glue them on. I wouldn't wash them after that though. If you browse through a couple of craft aisles at the store I'm sure you'll think of something! If you use glow in the dark paint that would be cute so they could use the shirts as pajama shirts too!    Good luck!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You can also buy blank iron on sheets and using the paint program on your computer you can make a decoration, then once you have your design, click on Image, click on Flip/rotate select Flip horizontal and click OK. It will make your image go backwards then you  can print it onto the iron on sheet and then iron on that to their shirts. We bought some of the iron on sheets from JoAnn Fabrics. I'm sure most craft stores would have them.|`|UgX5WeGPaa	hey girl!!! i was thinking about you... haven't seen ya in a bit.. but then i saw on the news that OK got hit with the storm the worse..   have you been home?     oh and i don't have a creative bone in my body so i don't think i can help.|`|oIyXMnmcaa	You could buy the tshirt-any color- and go to the craft store and buy some iron ons. They have tons and then you dont have to paint the shirts. Or you could see if you have one of those shirt stores near you...they put designs on the shirt for you and you can choose what you want to have put on the shirt.    Good luck!|`|n1vKoto7aa	Well, depending on how much effort you want to put into it:    You could sew 100 buttons on a shirt.  You could glue 100 "jewels" (available at any craft store)  You could take a Bingo dabber and put 100 dots on the shirt (fast and easy)  You could use rubber stamps and put 100 stamps on the shirt  You could put 100 stickers on the shirt (another fast and easy one)  You could paint, with puffy paint, the words, "one hundred" in a bunch of different languages all over the shirt  You could think of a list (funny or serious), like "100 reasons why School is Cool! [haha, your kids are still young enough to like school, right?]" or, "100 ways to say I love you!" or "100 things about ME!" and either write it on the back of the shirt with a fabric marker, or buy computer printer iron-on transfer paper and print it out and iron it on.
UUpsa35Daa	I'm 17 years old, and have no children right now but have been working and volunteering in daycares since i was 15.    Just putting that out there.    3 or more kids do take a lot of time money and patience. Kids in general take that. I'm not going to lie and say it's absolutely, without doubt...the easiest thing because we all know it's not. It's constant running, playing, feeding, napping, changing. It will be a lot more calm if you're waiting 4+ years though, your kids will be at a point where they're a tad bit more independent and can play on their own for a bit or they won't need you feeding them. You won't have to vigorously attend to a baby and two toddlers.    Money wise, yes...it will give you quite the hit. But kids are expensive. Only you and you husband know what you can afford however.    Think about how much patience you have, and how well you can juggle each kid giving them exactly what they need. And once again, only you and your husband know if you two can juggle another child.    My boyfriend and i have been talking about our future family lately and we both want a big one. The first number's he threw out were 4-6. I love kids, without a doubt, and i do want a big family. But i think about what kind of mother that might make me and i have some hold backs. While i do want a big family, i'm not going to let that want overshadow how good of a mother i am to my kids.. If that means, having 2 or 3 kids then deciding, for the sake of my children...this is all we can have then so be it.|`|AA12221392	I have 3 of my own and one step daughter-(she is my daughter I have been with her since she was 14 months )    It is hard to raise more kids, it has it's challenges. I think 3 kids is alittle harder than 4 though.     Let me explain- you go to amusment park when they get older, you ride with one , dad rides with one , well one more is by themselves.   Some one is always left out so to speak.     The kids usually group together - the two oldest , the two youngest or the oldest and youngest . ect    One child always feels left out when their is three has been my experience.  The middle child syndrome.....     The oldest gets more, the middle one is left out , the baby gets all the attention ( that is what I heard most of the time ) it wasn't so but that is how he felt most of the time .|`|VR9KhbEgaa	My husband and I have 6 children! And we manage just fine! We do make a lot of sacrifices but I think that goes along with having 1 or 10 these days! We do not take out of town trips but always manage to find something fun locally! We do not make a lot of money but our kids are very happy & healthy ...that is most important to us! Keep in mind that there in no guarantee that baby   3 would even be a girl!  My husband I have 5 boys & 1 girl! I really want another girl but at this stage we are not willing to take our chances!|`|kSZx9cY5aa	I have 3 children, and i'm currently pregnant with  4.  It's a little different for me though, because my oldest is 15, and my little boys are only 5 and 2.5. My daughter is verrry mature, and a huge help, so sometimes it only feels like I have 2 kids! I guess it's because I have different relationships with them.   None of my kids get left out, and I hope they don't feel like they do. We have a different relationship with our oldest because she was an only child for so long, because she's a teenager, and because she's the only girl. We have an equally fantastic relationship with Nicco and Kai (our little guys). Julietta (daughter) is extremely close to me, but is her dad's "princess". Nicco worships his dad, and they love doing "guy stuff" together, and I think he prefers his dad over me lol, but we have lots of fun together too. Kai, our youngest is a total mommies boy, but he thinks his dad is "sooo cool" lol.  They all get along really well. Julietta loves having little brothers she can play with, and help out with and she loves getting to see them grow. Nicco and Kai love playing with each other, and love having a big sister. I don't find it that hard, but my boys are SO energetic, it's hard to keep up with them! I don't know what i'll do with 3 of 'em! My husband desperately wanted a girl too! He was shattered when we found out i'm having a boy, but now he's excited. He will just have to wait for nieces!    Seeing as you say you want to wait for 4 years, I would just wait and se what your feelings are then. If you honestly don't think you could handle it, then don't feel pressured. Just choose what is best for you and your family.  Good luck =)|`|JEfOxpzeaa	my friends mom has 11 kids, she says that it is difficult but easier when the kids are farther apart in age, i suggest waiting until your 8 month old is at least 3, or 4.|`|1uyhFsFsaa	i have 6 children and to be honest once you have had two children i found it really didn't make a lot of difference when more came along. it don't mean that in a horrible way but in the practical way i integrated things like when the new baby needed feeding i used this time as story time where whist i was feeding baby the younger two and myself sat together and invented a story between us this stopped them thinking i had no time for them because it was baby time i found the baby also reacted and fed well due to having familiar voices around. children that are close in age also play well together mix with other children better aren't so clingy to mum and tend to entertain each other which makes your job easier as your attention is not demanded all the time. and as for the general workload it makes no difference cooking one extra serving or an extra load of washing.  having more children is not as much hard work as a lot of people think it is usually looked at as twice as much work but really you will find it isn't  anyway saying all this makes no difference to the fact it has to be your decision and only you know if you can handle it don't have another baby until you are sure yourself as you will possibly resent the baby if you aren't ready  good luck with your decision|`|ejrsSLr9aa	Enjoy the 2 kids you have while they are young! You have plenty of time to have more.|`|rOBTMriCaa	In my experience once you have are used to the demands of having 2 children adding another one really isn't that difficult.  I think going from having just one child to having two is a much harder transition that going from two to three.  It is more expensive, but you can learn to cut corners and make your money stretch.  You might want to wait a year or so until your sons get a little bit older just to make it a little easier on yourself.|`|NdJJuOGIaa	Congrats on your family.  Having kids are not a job and I don't think should be considered as one.  I don't know if having the best of everything is the best idea.  They might just grow up to be that much more arrogant to those around them and expect royal treatment from the parents.  Hence, it will be hard for them to appreciate.  I'm not telling you to have a lot of kids or otherwise but know your situation financially and emotionally.    At the end of the day, God gave women strong emotional attachment to children and gave men the ability to be a little harsh with them, within limits of course.  If dad plays the role of a dad and mom plays the role of a mom, everything will turn out fine.  And your kids will grow up to be good and honest people that contribute positively to society.  Or selfish, greedy, never satisfied, and the list continues.    Don't be afraid to make the difficult decisions because if you don't make them, especially when they're young, they won't take it easy on you later in life.
pDRAciBnaa	if she sleeps better swaddled,and you do...then swaddle her!! you know what,people may judge me but...holly is 9.5mos and is initially swaddled when she goes to bed she like your daughter is a wriggler and will hit herself until she wakes!! over the months however holly has got stronger and i swaddled her more lightly each week,so that now she can break out her swaddle if she wants,and most nights she does and sleeps perfectly,others i get her up in the morning and she is still all tucked in!! i wouldnt rush her,just loosen the swaddle as the weeks go by,and hopefully like holly if she does break out,she will self soothe back to sleep!|`|hGqQIusSaa	There's nothing wrong with swaddling, especially if it helps her sleep. Babies are comforted by being snuggled and swaddled, that's how they spent 9 months in your belly!  I swaddle my daughter and she is 5 months old!|`|jsdDgIuRaa	I swaddled my son to sleep until he was 4.5 months old.      Probably around 3.5 months I started swaddling him withe one arm out (I switched arms each night) so he could start getting used to not having both arms swaddled, then by about 4.5 months he was able to sleep without it.    If she sleeps better with it, then stick with it and don't worry about what your husband says, she'll be fine as long as it is only during sleep.|`|Lgo6UX12aa	according to babcenter.com  "It's fine to keep swaddling your baby for naps and nighttime if he seems to sleep better that way. He'll let you know by crying or kicking when he no longer wants to be bundled up."    So maybe it is time to give it a shot without the blanket? Since you are home all day - it will be easier for you to see how baby reacts. I know that it's going to be a pain listening to baby cry. But sometimes it has to happen. For your sanity and for their well being.     Are you sure there is nothing else going on? I realize that some babies are just "colicky" but my daughter became colicky when her reflux started and her reflux started because she ended up having a protein allergy! So are you nursing or are you bottle feeding? If you are nursing, maybe it is something in your diet? If you are bottle feeding - maybe try switching brands? We used to give our little girl a bottle before bed even though we were nursing because we found she slept better and longer that way. If you are strictly nursing, you could try adding a fast flow nipple and about a tsp of rice cereal per two ounces of formula. We treated our daughters reflux that way and she slept SO much better too.    Anywho - Good luck and I hope that you work this out!|`|tQVBDx5Paa	We swaddled our first until she was four months old.  That was when she was able to rollover.  I'd say it is fine.|`|YVasdve0aa	My  son was very colicky too.  His finally ended at about 4.5 months and he has been the happiest baby every since.  From one parent to another I would say do what ever works.  No baby book or other mother can tell you what works best.  Each child is different and if swaddling lets your baby sleep peacefully then that's what you should do.  You have the rest of her life to give it up but for now by all means swaddle her.  She needs her sleep as much as you do.     PS Hang in there, this only lasts a little while.
T7uFoSUQaa	Do you want your children to have the same letter for their first names? If so I like these "E" names:  Evan, Eddison, Edward, Elijah, Eldon, Elton    I kind of like Elijah Harrison or Eddison Henry    If you don't want "E" names, I like:  James, Lucas, Ryder, Sawyer, Greyson, Tyler, Charles (Charlie)    I think Greyson Dean is a cute name. Also Lucas James.    To Livin Life: You are a jerk. You have no right to criticize other's life choices, nor any right to attack a helpless child. There is no law that says you must be married to have children! Just a religious guideline given by God...the same God that you will be begging for mercy for calling a child that ridiculous name!    --------------------------------------...  Don't listen to the haters hun! Good for you!!!|`|RnS7uVIGaa	Evan Michale   Edward James   Erin Harold   Erin Luke   Good luck!|`|AA10763011	Elijah Harris,  and the answer by livin life is just mean. she was be a hag. don't take her personally.|`|OnbepMFNaa	before i start , LIVING LIFE , my mother wasnt married and i dont see nothing wrong with me and call me a bastard but think your a fricking ***** . this couple care about there kids i think that what really matter!      what about Eliot as the names both start with E and both 5 letters     good luck . xx|`|HurPmgSaaa	Evan Hardy  Elijah Harper  Erik Hanley  Everrett Heath    Nathan Hardy.

lkhCeAdJaa	I completely agree!  I believe that we need to LIVE according to how we want our children to LIVE.   I have made mistakes in the past (not to say I am perfect now) and I don't try to lie or cover them up.  I admit to my children that I used bad judgment in the past and I use THAT as an example to my children of how people DO screw up....don't make the same mistakes I did.    The things we expect of our children now are EXACTLY how we live or lives right now.  We've learned better and any of our past mistakes can be avoided by our children if they learn from us.    **Still agreeing with ya, Des.   Even if not with all of it, I agree with your main point:-)|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I call it being a good parent and wanting better for my child.  You can call it whatever you want.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Oh, I'll let my kids know, if they ask, or if it seems like information that they need to know in order to make a point.      It's OK for my kids to know about mistakes that I made, the path that I took, to get to where I am now.  It's OK for them to know that my life was a work in progress and that it still is.  I want them to know that it's OK for them, too, to make mistakes, to have adventures, to learn along the way.      And, there's always the chance that they'll actually learn from my mistakes & move on beyond them, making new mistakes, I'm sure - but, at least not wasting time repeating the same ones|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I wouldn't lie to my daughter about what i've done, but i also hope she doesn't do the things i've done.|`|DD5CMWfkaa	I think they are reluctant to tell their children because they don't want their kids to make the same mistakes that they did.     I am proud to say that I never kissed any other men other than my husband, and I'll be happy to tell my children that. However, I can understand why a parent would feel the need to lie if they have slept with multiple people in the past, especially if they regret it.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Ok hold on just a moment  First of all in life, you don't stop and say hey! If I do, this will I be able to tell my future kids about it, and not feel uncomfortable.  If you did that, you would never do anything in life.  Ok, so I had underage sex, and got pregnant. I am not proud of it, but I didn't stop to think, hmm by sleeping with this guy, am I going to be able to tell my kids about it in the future?  Why the heck would I want to tell my kids, about my past sex life, anyway?!  I got into a lot of trouble as a teen. Smoking, drinking, sex blah blah blah  Does that mean, I shouldn't tell my daughter not to do it, when she is a teen, because if would make me a hypocrite.  We all make mistakes in life, so don't insult people with your liars and misfits, because we are only human, even you.  Is it wrong that we learned from our mistakes, and want our children to live their lives differently, so they are protected from those mistakes?|`|DxbaEPbUaa	although i don't condone lying in any form, i do believe that there are some things that children just don't need to know!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well ,it's the do as i say not as i do type of thing. I don't think you can go your whole life thinking 'well i better not do this because some day I may or may not have kids I have to answer to' i know when I was younger and I did some of the things that I did I wasn't thinking I would have to explain myself to my children someday. it's not as easy as you cut it out to be. children don't need to know everything, especially when it comes to how many people I have slept with. and i think there is nothing wrong with having different rules for children then adults. you don't let your kids drink coffee but is it wrong because you do? no i don't think so. you just have to decipher exactly how much you tell your children. i don't think lieing to them is appropriate but sometimes kids ask questions that have hard answers and it's up to each parent to decide exactly how much detail to go into. i don't think anyone should be judged for that.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	I will tell her that I made bad choices when I was a young adult and that because of my bad choices I suffered ALOT emotionally.  I will also tell her that at 24 I took a vow of abstinence and waited for her father until we married 1 month before my 31st birthday.  I am not proud of my choices to have sex before marriage but I feel no shame.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	I don't think you understand what a hypocrite really is.  There is a big difference between pretending that you have a certain virtue and wanting something better for your kids.  Someone who had premarital sex who doesn't want their child to is probably not pretending they are virtuous so much as regretting their decisions and wanting their child to make better ones.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I think it's called learning from your mistakes. That being said, I slept with 3 people in my life, 1 was not consentual, 1 was a long term boyfriend, and 1 was my husband. I don't believe in lying to your kids because I don't want my kids to make the same mistakes I did. That's where the saying "do as I say, not as I do" comes in.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Everyone is hypocritical about something.  Most parents want their children to do as they say, not as they do.  That statement alone is hypocritical.  When my children ask for my advice, I plan on being upfront and honest.  Although I made wise decisions as a teen/young adult, there are still some things that I have done that I would encourage them NOT to do.  Its not hypocrisy so to speak, its simply speaking from experience.  I've been through it and I know how difficult it can be.  Why would I want my child to go through it as well?  Again though, I still plan on telling them the truth, I may just encourage them to take a different path than I did for whatever situation we are referring to.  Again, its not exactly hypocrisy...... its experience and wanting better for our own children.    *Des - I couldn't have said it better myself.  I came back to this question to add that I was referring simply to PAST mistakes.  Luckily, you had already cleared that up for me.|`|iSJFWFFkaa	if my daughter asks, i will tell her that i made mistakes in my past.  the ones that weren't resulted in her and her older brother.  and that i hope she will make better choices than i did.  as for a number, no, i won't give her one.  i also won't lie to her.|`|PyV1R4Xzaa	I don't forbid my children to do anything but they have always been bought up with     Don't hurt other (This includes physical/mental pain or injury and applies to animals, plants, humans etc)    Don't hurt yourself (This includes physical/mental pain or injury)    I have done things in the past that I wish I hadn't but giving a huge list to anyone telling them what they can't do is not going to help anyone and this doesn't make me a liar - I just want my children to be happy.    PS I hope you don't help your children with spelling|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	Making errors in your youth and not wanting your child to repeat them is not hypocrisy but teaching.   Ex: My mother smoked when I was a child and at the wise old age of 7 (maybe 8) I took a drag of her cigarette. It was horrible. Later in life I researched the harms of smoking and am adamant against my children smoking. Even if I had smoked throughout my childhood and had the misfortune of continuing to smoke through addiction (my husband is addicted to cigarettes but is currently quitting, it is one heck of a mean feat for some people), me telling my child not to smoke would not be hypocrisy but teaching my children through my mistakes. Now, if I had suddenly decided as an adult w/the complete knowledge AND understanding of the harms of smoking and told my child not to that would be hypocrisy.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	it is hypocracy if you tell your kids not to do something that you still do.    telling your kids not to do something that you did in the past (before you even had children), and now regret, is merely trying to have your kids benefit from your hard lessons.    a parent's past or present sex life, though, is simply none of a child's business, and falls in the category of way too much information.  i would not lie, but i would straightforwardly tell my child that adults don't share that kind of personal information.      *eta -- who says i feel that i made mistakes with my sex life, or that i did anything in my sex life i would tell my kids not to do? no, it's not an area where i'm hypocritical.  but even so, my children don't get the list of the people i've slept with, even if it's a short list.  why on earth would that be any of their business? would you walk up to a friend or teacher or grandparent and expect a list of the people they've had sex with? i think kids should learn that some information is private, and that it's rude to the person you've slept with to share details of your sex life with third parties.  [i don't, btw, believe that sex before marriage is wrong, and i will not tell my kids that, either.  i do believe that sex before you're mature enough to deal with the consequences and before you've found the right person is wrong, and i will teach my children that. -- and yes, lol, i know some of you who thumbs-upped me or said you agree with me now want to change your mind, so you can exempt the part in the brackets!]|`|s4LWmcTjaa	As always, Des has it down!    I completely agree with him (and Carrie and stay@homemomma).    I believe that all parents want their kids to not repeat their mistakes.  And as Des said, it's only hypocritical if you are still doing that particular behavior.    But there are somethings such as teens smoking cigarettes that are lawful issues rather than moral.  If a parent smokes and the teen says "Well you do it so why can't I?", it's not hypocritical to say "Because I am an adult and you are a teenager."  By law a teenager can't purchase or be in possession of tobacco products.  But that's just and example that came to mind.    I will not lie to my kids about anything if they ask or if the situation arises to where I might need to share my experiences with them.  I want them to know that I desire better for them and that if I could have done it differently I would have.      My kids can ask my husband and I how many partners we had before we were married and the answer would be none.  And that's because it's the honest to God truth.    To be perfectly honest, everyone is hypocritical at one point in time.  It's part of being human.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I believe that the majority of parents want better for their children.  They want to spare their children the same mistakes they made.  I don't believe that is bad at all.    EDIT - oh I get it.  This isn't a question about hypocrisy, this is a rant to tell people that if have sex before marriage that they are sinners.  I get it now.  Thanks.  I'm sure God appreciates you playing him for the people of Y!A.  I thought i read something about those who cast the first stone, or maybe thats only in my Bible.
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    Yes i am sure you will, if you've been getting them each year previously xx
L6w8YmoOaa	you have to file a complaint with her boss, a written complaint, that way if their are any future complaints something will be done by her employers.|`|yNbGq4viaa	First of all, if you don't ask the caregiver about the situation you will never know what really happened.  I know our job as mothers is first and foremost to protect our children, but you need to ask the director of the facility about it and find out their side.  Sometimes "rough" to a child is not "rough" to an adult.  I had something along these lines happen at my son's child care center as well.  My son and I were talking one night while we were coloring and he told me that another little boy showed him his "hot dog" and told him to eat it.  I asked him where the little boy got the hot dog from.  He said "out of his pants".  Now, you can imagine my reaction.  I remained calm in front of my son, but was furious, scared, hurt, incredulous inside.  The next day I called the center first thing, I even took the day off work to stay home with my son because I was scared to send him.  After speaking with the teacher in his class room it became all too clear what really happend.  They have plastic food there that goes with a play set they have.  The little boy had stuck the plastic hot dog in his pocket and they were playing cook out and he asked my son to pretend to eat the hot dog.  I confirmed this by taking my son to the center and asking him to show me the hot dog.  He went straight to the play food and picked it up.  Just talk to them before jumping to conclusions.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Do what you need to do in order to get that woman fired. You probably don't need hard evidence in order to do so. Tell the head honcho over there at the school what happened and that should be enough. I'm NOT judging you for bringing your daughter there, but I hear stories like this waaaay too much. And there isn't much you can do about it when you never know who you can trust!! I completely understand your frustration and you absolutely need to talk to someone ASAP about it so this woman doesn't show her face there anymore. Good luck.|`|RQc8fbjbaa	I would bring it up to the woman. Is it possible the woman did not know she even hurt your child? Maybe she was in a hurry to wipe her tears and was a little too rough. Things like that can happen. But, I also think you should bring it up to who ever is in charge of the school so they can make sure they keep an eye on how she is interacting with the children.|`|XXZFf1AYaa	You're overreacting. Come on "she knows where we live"??    If you don't feel that she's getting the treatment you expect from the childcare she's in, definately take her out if possible. But I've also seen alot of parents act all crazy (me being one of them at some point no doubt) when you *think* something is worse than it really is. My neice stepped on my foot several times after I told her nicely not to, so when I bent down and sternly told her "Do..Not..Step on my foot again!" She stopped, of course, and my sister complained to me the next day that my neice said I was very mean to her and so my sister asked if I even love her?!? HELLO...I love my niece and since then and before we are fine. Her mom just took her daughters words and got all defensive and offended.    You're situation is somewhat different, but like I said if you ever feel uncomfortable with your childs daycare, just take them out ASAP.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I am not doubting you firstly, but, a child having reddened eyes, is really grounds to fire someone.  It is possible, that the care giver did not even no she was hurting the child.  Some tissues might be to rough for her, or the caregiver didn't realize she needed a softer touch.  Plus, the caregiver actually cleaned her tears. I feel if she was abusing the baby, she would have just left her there, to cry.  However if you are concerned, talk to the caregiver,  There is not point getting a innocent fired because your are over reacting.  If she is purposely hurting the child, then by all means, complain, but find out what happened first before you jump to conclusions|`|gBAstki5aa	FIRE THE HOE.|`|Y8WDdPCvaa	fire her, but just ask y the hell she did it!|`|IYnxKUH7aa	i jus say a swift headbutt wud solve this situation... lol no o.j    humiliate whoever did it, take your child to the place and infront of every1 ask her to point at who did it, and then ask her wot they did, it will either be revealed to everyone or just make that 1 person very embarrassed and feel awkward|`|EcKLqBnCaa	So all that happened was the teacher dried her eyes too roughly? Perhaps she just doesn't have the gentle touch. If this is an isolated incident, let it go. Just tell your daughter to report to you anything negative this teacher does to her or any other children.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	I would mention it to the school or person in charge that your daughter told you she was rough when wiping her tears and it bothered you.  That way 1) you told them and 2) they can keep an eye out for her to not do this again.  You can also talk to her personally.  Not by blaming or judging her but be calm and ask questions like how was she today.  Did you have any problems, etc. See how she comments about your questions and then if necessary comment my daughter said she was crying yesterday, was everything ok and see what she says.  Keep an eye out for her.  If anything else happens I would remove her from the school or tell the manager.  No one will love your child as much as you or look out for them as much as you.|`|7e700825133cf6328b412b5715dc6692aa	Her eyes were a little red .. i am sorry but this doesn't prove a lot maybe she used tissue to wipe your daughters eyes i have made this mistake with my children and it does make their eyes red, but crying does this too, i think you should ask her face to face why your daughters eyes were 'red' but i think you maybe reading too much into what your daughter is saying children do exaggerate the truth sometimes but this is no means for a woman to loose her job, My son does attend a special school and has come home with scrapes, but i find out what has happened first then take it from there,

Hub1UGqPaa	The hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (better known as hCG) is produced during pregnancy. It is made by cells that form the placenta, which nourishes the egg after it has been fertilized and becomes attached to the uterine wall. Levels can first be detected by a blood test about 11 days after conception and about 12 - 14 days after conception by a urine test. In general the hCG levels will double every 72 hours. The level will reach its peak in the first 8 - 11 weeks of pregnancy and then will decline and level off for the remainder of the pregnancy.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	WEll u can find out ur preg at 4- 5 weeks depends what kind of test u use. The pregnancy hormone HCG doubles every 48 hours.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	You can find out if you are pregnant approximately 2 weeks after conception.

Normally its best to wait (with the standard tests) about 4-5 days after your due.  Basically what the test and the doctor would be looking for in your urine, is the presence of HCG, which very early on in pregnancy is not as concentrated so thats why if you test too early, if might show up a false negative.  When you are testing, its best to test the first pee of the day because that is when HCG is at its highest levels, and don't drink anything to make yourself go because you will just be diluting the levels.  The tests talk about using mid-stream pee which I think is just ridiculous, how on earth are we supposed to do that.  So I pee in a disposable coffee cup and then just hold the test in there until I see a bright and clear result.  I have done four tests in my life and am now on my second pregnancy.    To be honest, with this pregnancy, I started feeling symptoms like a week after I would have conceived, because I had been pregnant before, I knew what the signs were and how my body felt the first time.   And it was really frustrating waiting to take a test.  But if you aren't late yet, then its best just to wait, and if you are late, just wait until you are atleast 5 days late to take a test that you can trust.  And if you are more than 5 days late then...you aren't having your period, there aren't a lot of other explanations.  Maybe try going to another doctor if your local office is making these cockups?    Good luck!
M3maZgdyaa	Your right and I am amazed at the lack of common sense in today's world.|`|TdIbrGYYaa	Seriously, you and I both know that most people are afraid to listen to what others are saying about products, food and such.  Just listen to one of the medicine adds.  This will help you with this this this and this but side affects are this this this this oh and by the way may make your first this even worse.  No one knows what to think anymore so it's more like a better safe than sorry type question.  Don't you agree?|`|eD7qRBKHaa	Most of it is common sense, but there are a couple of things that people forget about.  That's why they ask.

I'm sure I'm going to get all kinds of thumbs down,but it's going to be more for my music interests than me going to a concert,or even the concert,because women freak out over EVERYTHING anymore it seems.

If you have low blood pressure that can negatively effect your baby as well.  Do it now, it will make me feel better.
S5v9I0y2aa	The baseline rate of birth defects is around 4%.  So it's impossible to know if your foundation caused it.    This time around, you should stop using that foundation ,switch to a non-medicated one (including one that doesnt' have salicylic acid in it, double check with your pharmacist because retinol has many names).  It is unlikely that you would have absorbed enough to cause damage, there are much higher concentrations of this stuff in prescription acne agents.  But it is still uncertain (they never do studies because they know it can be harmful), so I would suggest switching foundations.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	I highly doubt that using makeup caused a birth defect in your baby.|`|E2h4QuxKaa	I would ask your pediatrician if that's possible.  It kind of seems far fetched that a foundation would cause something like that...but you never know these days I guess.|`|MbmHripJaa	I am not really sure if it can cause a birth defect, but you can ask your doctor or just not use it for your own piece of mind.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I've never heard of not using it,or it causing issues. If it caused issues,you'd think they'd have to put "talk to a doctor while pregnant". Your poor son may have had a defect just because well some babies do unfortunately :(. I wouldn't blame it on yourself,I would talk to the doctor and see if it's ok though,as I've never read/heard not to use it or to use it.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi listen if it was the make up then they would put a health warning on it and i used foundation with both mine because i never knew it contained that. my 2 were perfectly healthy. its probably not link and was just one of those things. good luck.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Because it contains Retin-A there is a chance that it can cause birth defects.  You have every right to worry.  I suggest talking to your OB right away and discussing this with her.  She will know better whether or not the amount in the foundation is harmful to the baby.|`|zkFuXoNDaa	How far along are you with this baby?|`|Duho7OJRaa	Its simple, if u dont want ur baby

1uyhFsFsaa	sounds like a recipe for success form what you have written. you haven't rushed into anything you have taken it nice and slow with the children giving them time to get to know each other. staying at weekends was a positive move and if everything has gone well then i can't see any problems. by the sounds of it the children are all ready to live together and that is the most important thing. i know we shouldn't let children control the adults but in these cases i think it is more important for them to be able to make that choice whether the adult like it or not. if a stepchild is not happy then there are high chances of everything failing because of it.  i would however keep your house going for a while just in case, as a bolthole it would give you and your children the security if things did go wrong for any reason. which i really can't see happening from what you have said  your children seem to want this and if you and your girlfriend are happy to move in together i would 100% go for it.   hope everything goes well for you all|`|TQW5E6olaa	You know..before I had my daughter, I would say go for it. But now, I'd say after the wedding. Why wait a few years? If you want to get married, get married and then do the family thing. Marriage implies commitment so I would want that before changing my daughter's life. Just me personally, do what you feel. What does she want?|`|lGcpXteaaa	Absolutely nothing wrong with 'trying before you buy'.  Sometimes relationships can change when you move in together. I wouldnt dream of marrying somebody who i had never lived with.    There are some people who are compatible but cannot live together.  I believe you cannot truly know somebody until you have lived with them at least 6 months.  There was certainly a lot of things i found out about my partner when we moved in together...even though we were together 2 years before that.|`|TprIqGhCaa	No!!! It's not wrong at all, in fact it's a great idea! You don't want to get married and then move in with her and find out that you guys can't live together. See what it's like first living together.
LJGzpSmyaa	Its a yes from me... some other indications to look for >    hair loss while washing your hair.  Darker than normal urine  weeing a lot more than normal  Blood tests are usually pretty acurate though so wait a week and if still no period go back and see the doc, It is easy to imagine the signs if you are hopping for a positive result (I've done it)  congrats if so x x|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Some of those are pregnancy symptoms- the fatigue, growing breasts, feeling sick and missing period.  You could have taken a test 3 weeks ago- go buy one today and check.  If it is still negative see a doctor again for another blood test or request an ultrasound.  Tell them all of your symptoms.  They may all be from something else.  The weight loss can cause a late period, fatigue, and leg cramps.|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	Go to the doctor. That's the best answer solution. Not everyone's body is the same.|`|mxixfE3Raa	I'm not sure about the white discharge, but everything else sounds like you probably are pregnant.  I'm not sure why the tests are negative though.  Wait another week and do another HPT with your morning urine.  Good Luck|`|A1q8vA9Daa	Except for feeling sick and delay in period all other things are not the symptoms of pregnancy. By the way if you have irregular periods problem you are definitely not pregnant. Check this out http://www.webyam.com/snippets/pregnancy...|`|YzCPY48qaa	if your bloods are negative,then you are probably not pregnant,could just be late for another reason?|`|zkFuXoNDaa	WELL WELL WELL....   Are they symptoms of pregnancy?  Feeling sick- YES  leg cramps- NO  slight loss of weight? NO  boobs grown? this early? NO --boobs SORE-YES  big blue veins in boobs-  I DON'T KNOW  extreme fatigue- YES  lots of white runny discharge-NO  irritibility-YES  hot chocolate has a metallic taste?- I DON'T THINK SO!!!  3 weeks late on period- DEFINITELY  HOWEVER:  You've taken a pee test AND a blood test and they BOTH came out negative?  Who gave you the blood test?  Your doctor? If your doctor gave you a blood pregnancy test, then it should be correct, right?  Maybe you should go back and ask the doctor what's wrong with you.   Give us more details!  Good luck.|`|KsPp27CYaa	yup...cud be preggers|`|joPJtKemaa	Wouldn't you think it would be better to ease your mind by taking a pregnancy test?|`|fPX1lD8uaa	The only way to know for sure is if you take a test.  But yes, sounds like pregnancy is a possibility.    Good luck!|`|f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	I think the biggest one is the 3 weeks late.  Take a test or two.  If you get negatives, go to your doc for a blood test. You could very well be pregnant!  Good luck!|`|67jA9Wb7aa	yeah sounds alot like the symptoms, if your nipples have gotten darker thats another good sign, and the white discharge sounds bad as in ill.|`|o3zLlogMaa	Yes, these are all signs of pregnancy, however it is possible to have these symptoms without being pregnant. On the other hand my mother didnt get a positive test with me until she was 6 months pregnant! Hope you get what you want x|`|VMASMHX6aa	Unfortunately it doesn't matter how many symptoms you have, unless that test is positive then you are not pregnant. If you've had a blood test and it's negative then you are definitely not pregnant.|`|ycdkngxlaa	Some of those signs do suggest that you could be pregnant but other's just suggest that you may have a cold or something (that could be why food taste's funny). Also the vaginal discharge you are experiencing sounds like thrush to me.    As your period is three weeks late and you are still getting negatives, wait a while more and test again. But maybe your period has just been delayed because you aren't feeling too good.    Good Luck.|`|DoOZrGU1aa	You could be sick and that's holding off on your period...  Periods can be missed up to six months due to stress.     and its called discharge.   it usually gets really heavy when you start your period.     or c*m.
FEKf1Lzlaa	No, when a baby is formula fed they are usually eating approx. the same amount at each feeding and feedings should be about the same amount of hours apart.  When you are breastfeeding there is really no way to gage how much the baby is eating, also the consistency of the breast milk can change from feeding to feeding (being more or less watery depending on length of time between feeding, mom's diet, etc.)  Even with "on demand" feeding, most babies will get themselves on some sort of a 'schedule.'|`|kqlewhJNaa	I demand feed my baby when I was breastfeeding to a point. But once I started bottle feeding her, I put her on a schedule. It's better for them and for you.|`|DS21ekeJaa	I kept my babies to a schedule with formula and gave a few ounces of water in between to hold them over. It was not rigid, but we worked at a 4 hour feeding- with 3 or 5 hours being fine if that is what baby needed. Within 2 weeks they all were having their bottles during our normal meal times with a night bottle before bed and a middle of the night feeding until they were about 10lbs and having 6-8 ounces at a feeding.   I started them on cereal when they started waking at night again- all at 5-6 months of age.|`|5m74HzIWaa	I don't think it works quite the same with formula, I would try to stick to the guidelines on the formula can but if it is only one extra bottle a day it shouldn't matter, all babies are different after all.     It also depends on the age and size of your baby, my son has just been switched to formula after being BF for 6 months on demand, and he has 5 bottles a day and 1 breastfeed, and the formula guide says he should only be having 4 bottles a day. He is a large baby though so I figure his appetite is appropriate for his size.|`|w4u4UW8Iaa	I would assume so if you breastfeed on demand it would be confusing for your baby to switch from on demand to a schedule only for formula unless you are switching from on demand to a schedule. The formula will satisfy your little one longer than breastmilk.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	yes, but it is easier to see how much your baby is eating when you formula feed so you can judge the time between feedings better. i mean really, if your child is crying because hes hungry,,, you gonna tell him its not time yet? hehe|`|AA11600455	yes
dnG7fhnbaa	I have had four miscarriages and with all of them I experienced severe pain and bleeding for 3-4 days which finally gave way to normal bleeding and pain for about 1 week.    I did feel very sick with the pain of the miscarriages, probably because of the mental torment of knowing you are loosing your baby on top of the physical pain. Sorry you have had to experience this.    Hope you start feeling a little better soon. x|`|VxINaY0Eaa	It's totally normal to be in pain & bleeding in a miscarriage no matter how far along you are. From personal experience, I went through "mini-labor" at 10 wks gestation. I was in pain, cramps are the mini contractions I felt, and general nausea and sick. I'd had an ultrasound which showed my baby did not have a heartbeat. The tech wouldn't tell me the truth though I saw him on the screen. She said only the doctor would talk to me. The doctor was cold & hurried as he told me "these things just happen" and that I should come back for a D&C. I was stupified yet wits enough to know that I did not want that. Within almost 18 hrs of that prognosis of a dead baby in my womb, I began having the contractions, heat, and major discomfort of "delivering' my child. I called his Daddy to come help me, I wanted to go to the hospital once the contractions started. The pains were coming in waves, and unbeknownst to me at the time, just like labor does, quicker as birth is more imminent. Apparently a woman's body still works even though she is delivering a stillborn premature miscarriage baby and after all my pains I went to the tub to be clean for the hospital intrusion into my body and there, I dropped my baby still in its fetal sac about 3 inches wide. My dead child who'd not a hearbeat for 2 days I'd known of, was delivered dead there in my bathtub, without surgical means, without invasive procedures. There my own body deliverd forth what it had to do, just in time millenia before had done. Trust your body, trust your instinct, and trust your heart before seeing your doctor to suction out your "tissues." It's your body, it's your baby, and it's your bill. Decide how much you want to hand over to a cold stranger who could care less how much you resemble a case file. Honey, your mini-miscarriage-labor doesn't last that long, only long enough to know you've lost something great.Then it's time to move on. Don't let those so-called "educated" rob you of your time w/ the last of your baby dream. Your body is expelling the end of a beginning, it takes as much time to successfully bring it out as it seems, starting it.My heart is with you. If it takes longer than 2 days, see a doctor. Bleeding will take at least 2 wks or more. Common sense will dictate whether u need extra medical attention, yet know your body has most of the answers itself. Trust your instinct.|`|eksBfc0oaa	normal for the pain, part of it is mental anguish as well. Bleeding should persist for another 5-7days and then your be back on your regular cycle.|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	I miscarried at 10 weeks.  I was bleeding for 16 days before I saw the doctor. I was under the early pregnancy unit of my local hospital. I was bleeding for about 4 weeks in total.  The hardest thing is the mental pain. It takes a long time to get over a miscarrage. I had my miscarrage in 2001 and I had a daughter in 2006. It took me that long to get to the point I could think about trying again.  If you are trying for a baby, it can be very easy to get pregnant again after miscarrage. My mum miscarried and then got pregnant again within a month.
fb61d99b32eb382445becee914185af9aa	I would tell her, because it makes that tie to the family, and it gives your child a tie to family.  And I'm sure she can give you some emotional support aswell when the time comes.  I mean its not just giving her a grandchild, but you are giving your child a grandmother.  I would probably write her a letter, tell her everything about how I felt and about whats going on and that you are just writing to let her know about her grandchild, and you dont want any money or anything, say you would love to meet up for coffee or lunch, without her son, because that is gone and finished with, and you just want to have a relationship with her now for the sake of your child.  Put in all your details in the letter and tell her its up to her to make contact, but you will call in a few weeks if you dont hear anything from her in case for some reason she didnt get the letter, and then thats it.    Good luck!|`|doSdEtqYaa	I am a male. but i cld answer this question bcoz a close friend of mine also had the same problem. But she was not married at that time. She gave a deadline to tat guy. That deadline expired. She threatened him that she would leave a complaint in a police station.HE didnt do anything. Then she went and explained both his/her parents by person and both their parents had a conversation. The problem was solved by then.        But one thing about boys is they would defnitely listen to what  their mother wants them to do!|`|BiixbvkMaa	I think it would be a good idea to let her be in the child's life. Shes not the one who did that to you. So, I would give her the chance to have a relationship with her grandchild. But, it's totally up to you what you choose to do. Good luck with everything. Hope everything works out for you.|`|yNvyuBSnaa	I would say if you like her and think she would be a good role in your child's life then go for it. Forget him look out for yourself and your child. If she likes you which it sounds like from how you describe her i think she would love the chance to be in her grandchild's life.|`|83905a9de542a6f172297328fe300a63aa	Go in person and talk to her. She seems to be a good woman. She'll definitely take care of the child properly.|`|A1S5KNUkaa	My daughters father doesn't want her yet his parents are wonderful people who see my daughter every week and have her for the weekend every other week.  Unfortunately they are still in denial and try to force my daughter on him (I have no contact with him at all) but over the last couple of weeks have realised the full extent of it all and understand he really doesn't want to know.    That said I am happy for them to spend as much time as they like with my little girl as it's her right to know her family.    My advice is to contact your childs grandmother and let her make the choice.  That way at least your conscience is clear =)|`|cj7sSPZEaa	I would call the woman to get a feel for what she thinks of the situation.  Let her know that you don't want to endanger your baby by letting the father around, but maybe the baby's grandmother would like to see him/her.  As long as she is clear on the fact that her son is not to come into contact with the baby, then sure- let her be a part of the baby's life.|`|AA10529334	I think you should consider that this lovely woman raised a son who beat you -- is she really all that lovely?|`|82388b0078348e0dd7d5a4f4001f503eaa	tricky!   i guess it's up to him to tell his family but if that was me (the child) i would like to have contact with my gran even if my dad was a jerk!   if i was in your shoes i would tell him mum... why should she lose out?
nahohzLHaa	you cant feel it yet wait until your 18 to 20 weeks and you should be able to feel it and when you are 18 to 29 weeks try feeling where your uterus is around that area i hope i helped|`|AYLRIMZJaa	Dont' punch your stomach.  And you shouldn't really feel anything for another 6 weeks or so.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	Your stomach gets hard because you're feeling your uterus as opposed to your normal stomach-y insides. And all your normal stomach-y insides get smushed up really tight together. So your stomach won't get hard until your uterus is in your stomach, which is still a long ways off for you. Your uterus will barely start creeping over your pubic bone at 12 weeks, and will grow enough to hit your bellybutton at 20 weeks (and then continue to grow up and outwards until delivery). In this time frame is when your stomach will feel hard to you.    Congrats and good luck!!|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	not till like 14 wks and dont push on it
1Si9RlEXaa	I don't know why people are so rude, it's your decision to co-sleep. I do with my 5 month old. She sleeps between Hubby and me. If that is not an option you can try pushing your bed up against a wall.  Or even bring a crib right next to your bed. (My baby is like yours starting to worm around a lot. I am a light sleeper and wake to the slightest noise.     There are lots of studies that show co-sleeping does not make your children over dependent.  In fact we are one of the one few countries that thinks it "bad" to co-sleep. Check out Ask Dr. Sears web page. They have some great research on the advantages of co-sleeping.|`|AA11004428	i've never heard of the term "co-sleeping" in the states. a child of that age should be in his own bed/crib. you're just asking for trouble. god forbid the child rolls off while you're sleeping.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I am a very heavy sleeper and I still wake up for my baby, before she even cries. I have my bed pushed against the wall. If you really think he will crawl off  and get hurt without you realizing, I would either move your mattress to the floor or put him in his own crib. Good luck!|`|uhj76Fkpaa	Well you can put pillows or a big blanket to his side so that he won't fall during the night.But my best advise is that you should put him out of your bed and move him to his own.It's the best for him not only cause he'll be secure but to be indepented and have his own place.It will be really difficult for him to go to another bed as he grows.Don't use the nursing as an excuse.Many mothers nurse but have their babies in cribs.Take care|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I sleep with my daughter in my arms-Her head is on my shoulder and my arm is wrapped around her and under her butt. This way not only am I holding her on the bed, but if she does move I will know right away.     I'm in favor of co-sleeping and I have done it with both of my children. However, accidents do happen. Last week my daughter (10 months) crawled off the bed in the middle of the night. It was the first time I did not wake up when she moved. She ended up getting "stuck" under our bed, trapped between the bed frame and the floor. I took her to urgent care and x-rays were done-She's OK now, just a big bruise  and a scrape on her forehead. But I really don't want to see another mom go through what I did-If your baby can crawl, it may be time to transition him into his crib.|`|UXhFcHCHaa	you could put pillows down or put him in between you an your guy ( if you have one) maybe you could put some kind of a bell like on his ankle so you will hear him when he moves around. you could also move his crib next to your bed that way you can get him when he needs to nurse and you wont have the fear of him crawling around. i am not co sleeping personally but these are some the ideas i came up with bc in the morning my little one comes to bed with me  edit: just rethunk the bell idea. doesnt sound to good maybe you can put them on his socks.|`|zc9ZhoMIaa	My 8 month old still sleeps with us. I have my bed pushed up against a wall, and her crib is at the foot of the bed. So if she wakes up and i don't hear her, she would have to actually crawl over me to get anywhere. But I sleep super light when shes in the bed with me. She sleeps in her crib sometimes, but she still wakes up at night for a bottle, so I usually put her in the bed with me. Don't listen to everyones opinion on the baby sleeping with you. Its your decision and there is nothing wrong with it. I actually miss her being there next to me when she does sleep in her crib.   You do whats comfortable for you!    One option is putting your matress on the floor and baby proofing your room completly. So if he did get off the bed, it would not hurt him|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I never had a railing and always just slept with my arm around my son, but if you are not a light sleeper that may not work for you. Now that he is older (16 months) he sleeps in between me and my husband, so he can't roll out.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	?????s- I'd love to add a comment to your little "you will not wake up....blah blah blah" tirade.  I have 4 kids, ages 12, 10, 2, and 1. ALL co-slept, ALL woke me when they started moving around. some of us mom's dont sleep like the dead. some of us are very intune w/our children. whoopty doo, don't co-sleep if you don't feel comfortable, or don't trust your body and subconscious to wake you, that's your right, but back off the OP and back off the other posters that KNOW damn well they can and will wake up if baby rouses.     to the OP (originial poster)- Hon, i took my boxspring and frame out of my room and put them in the garage, we slept on the pillow top matress w/a thick foam matress on the floor on the other sides of us incase my kids ever desided to make a swan dive. none did. we kept them in the middle, between my hubs and me. I would put them in the crook of my left arm in the middle of the bed, and fell asleep in that position, and STAYED in that position till they woke to feed. I've never rolled over w/baby. i'm just built that way. some people aren't and those ppl shouldn't co-sleep.   As soon as my children were sleeping through the night we put them in a side car- a bassinet that attaches to the bed. around 4 months is when they usually did that. around 6 months when they were pulling up on their knees, and sitting well on their own we moved them to the crib, which is in our bedroom. as soon as they were 2 yrs old, they slept in their own bedrooms...more so because when we started we only had 1 bedroom...and then we rented a house w/2 bedrooms and were finally able to move my older boys into their own room. Sometimes they'd come back to bed w/us if they had a nightmare, or woke up fussy...like all kids, but i had NO isses getting them to sleep in their own beds all night by the age of 3, and if they woke up we went with them and tucked them in again. my boys are outgoing, friendly, and very independent...they are not "momma's boys" (ridiculous comment from Mikki A). My daughter is 2, (she'll be 3 Feb 8th) and she sleeps in her crib converted to a toddler bed (highly recommend that crib! they last forever), in her own bedroom and she rarely comes to bed w/us.   my youngest son is 1 y/o and he sleeps in his crib in our bedroom. sometimes he wakes around 2am (teething and growing pains) he gets motrin, a cup of warm milk and a diaper and he's back to sleep in about 15 mins. when he is 2 he'll have his own bedroom...once i move my middle son in w/my oldest lol.  Finally bought a house w/enough bedrooms for my rug rats! lol    moving them to their bed is a slow process, and makes it MUCH easier for them to adjust. start w/naps, then work your way up to the bedtime practice of laying him down in his crib. if you want the crib in your room...put it in there! do what makes YOU and your son comfortable, not what negative nay-sayers on co-sleeping say.|`|uKBJniEKaa	Get him a crib, seriously. That, or get ready for a momma's boy.|`|hgbfzGSMaa	I would begin the transition now!  Lots of parents *think* they will wake up and keep their baby from falling off the bed, but it doesn't always happen that way.      I also read this article, and not to scare you...but safety should be your first concern.  Convenience should be a distant second.      http://children.webmd.com/news/20090123/...|`|f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	Are you a deep sleeper?  I am a super light sleeper and I always felt or heard my boys moving around. I'd wake right up!  I'm sure you will wake up.  Our awareness tends to be heightened when it comes to our babies.  Good luck!|`|xc8bnpCvaa	I was there, my son was in my bed until he was almost 4. It causes issues later on. SO I would begin to transition him to his own bed for a number of reasons...  If you are certain you want this, you need to either drop your bed to the floor or possibly add something like a day bed pushed directly up against to your bed. The child is essentially still in your bed but has the safety of 3 sides being closed off.     There was a comment about mother's never smothering their babies from another poster, that is not true, just last year there were numerous news stories about babies dying from being suffocated by sleeping parents.|`|my4GD7YVaa	My daughter is five months and we co sleep.  I don't have a rail or anything I just sleep towards the middle of the bed ( and squeeze my husband off the edge :P )  Anyways, though my daughter hasn't started to crawl or anything.. she does move a lot and it really has started to affect my sleeping.  I like to co sleep because its so much easier to feed.  I plan on putting her in her crib once she is on foods and sleeps through the night.  However if I continue to not get any sleep from her kicking and moving I might have to rethink.    I don't know how long you are planning on co-sleeping, but I would suggest putting him in once he is eating solid foods because thats when they sleep through the night and when some babies start to crawl.  I think you will probably have to do this because Im not sure there is anyway that you CAN keep him in the bed.  I know I will miss my daughter when she's gone ( its kinda like ahaving a teddy to cuddle with lol) but it will probably be better for us both in the long run.  I know that it goes by fast but sometimes we just have to let go : (|`|b6baOLOeaa	I understand you wanting advice from co-sleeping mommies. I am one. I find it comforting to know the baby is safe beside me.    You can get 'baby bumpers' they sell them at Wal-Mart and Babies 'R' Us you put each bumper on the side of the baby and they are stuck in a single position. I find it good for side sleepers(like my daughter) that way they can't roll over!(lol)    hope that helps.:)|`|Lgo6UX12aa	Please don't listen to the people who are telling you not to co sleep. It's so comforting to have you child laying next to you. We would have co slept longer if we hadn't stopped nursing. Now our girl is such a fidgeter that she is impossible to keep in the bed. Sh constantly wants to stand up.     This is going to be my suggestion. Why don't you consider side-carring your crib? Here is a link to tell you how: http://www.freewebs.com/sidecarcrib/inde...  This was something I wanted to do, but never had the space to do it cause the crib we had at the time was too big. Now we have a different one - but now she's in her own room too.     That or like someone said before - put your bed on the floor and things will be easier as well. Good luck - and I hope it all works out. I know people who have co slept for YEARS! Just do what's best for you and for baby.|`|c6e690076ee77af06c3afa06c8c01e83aa	My son is 9 months old and has been sleeping in our bed for awhile now. I'm not breastfeeding but if he's not in our bed he wakes up every hour or so and I can't wake up that many times and be nice the next day.   He has crawled out of the bed once (our bed isnt that high off the floor) without me hearing him or feeling him until he cried for me. Usually when he wakes up he pulls my hair or crawls on me and wakes me up. I think that time he wanted to explore the room so he let me sleep..lol. We put pillows at the end of the bed and on the floor around the bed just in case he tries it again. Also, don't forget to baby proof your room just in case he gets free to crawl around in there.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I'm a very light sleeper.  If he moved, I woke up.  I don't really worry about this too much.  IF anything, you can put your mattress on the floor for a while.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	if your bed is on the floor that would be safer, or put pillows around the bed- i was never concerned because i wake up as soon as my son moves- he has never crawled off my bed and he's 21 months old. of course he can get off on his own now though     more babies die alone in their beds than with a parent- give me a break people- have YOU ever met a person who smothered their child? nope but i have known a few people's babies who have died alone in their crib     people don't want to be bashed for their choices like formula etc. but they will bash you for yours   i didn't say mothers never do it- if you are a heavy sleeper obviously it's not for you, but more babies die by themselves ya know. you have to take the proper precautions     BTW- my son WILL sleep on his own- that is not a problem of getting him out of my bed- i just feel safer this way|`|ad4daf6f7da719b58951682b49e79c01aa	If you have the space you may consider transitioning him to a pack and play. They are easy to set up and close up. This way you still have the convenience of having him close by while not having to worry about his safety. Good luck!|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I moved my son's crib right up against the bed and removed the drop rail.|`|fHjSonssaa	You WILL NOT wake up when he wants to get up and move.  They can be silent little things.  My son occasionally co-sleeps- we keep him in between us and my son pretty much gets the bed while my parner and I crunch over to the sides.  My son is now 10 months old.    There is NO way our son could be over to the side at this point- even if I have my arm around him.  He's a silence stealth mover- you'd never know.    My son usually sleeps in his crib- just because of this.  Lately he's been getting up in the middle of the night and pulling himsef up in the crib-  however due to our temporary living situation (we are staying at my parents house and moved bedroom furniture here)- we have a rather large room, but our son's crib is in our bedroom.  Which isn't ideal, however we don't have a choice at the very moment and it makes for very convenient night-time feedings.  He still gets up occasionally wanting to eat.         Last night he slept with us- and with him in the middle, he HAS to crawl OVER one ofhis to get anywhere- and the good news is while he can be silent, he isn't graceful.      Whatever you do, don't think for a minutes your son will sit still.  Once you know he can move- that's it.  Our little boy already had a tumble to floor because my partner was awake- and I went downstairs to get a bottle.  He fell asleep in the 2 minutes I was gone and there went our son.  Luckily, he was OK.  But we've learned our lesson.    Good luck!
hWc65sEtaa	I was told I was having 3 boys with the ultrasounds, but ended up having 3 girls.  Nothing is ever 100% until the baby is born.  Good Luck.|`|7C9Ett7Caa	Its easier to mistake a boy for a girl on an ultrasound. Its very rare to mistake a girl for a boy. Think about it, girls dont have anything there, boys definately have something that would be very hard to mistake for a vagina. So your probably definately having a boy!! Congrats!!    If you want to be sure, you could get a 3D ultrasound like I did. Thats how I know Im definately having a girl, lol.|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	I found out at 18 weeks it was a boy but I didn't see it for myself.  Luckily for me I got to go for a couple ultrasounds after that!    This was my boy at about 21 weeks...did it look anything like this?  http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn130...    He is definitely a boy...here is the 3D ultrasound picture from 25 weeks:  http://i303.photobucket.com/albums/nn130...    I also had another 3D ultrasound at 31 weeks and it was still there haha!|`|AA10186411	Its never 100%.  Not until birth anyway lol|`|i8Ch743Laa	It's pretty obvious if it's a boy. Finding out the girls this early,I would see a cause for not knowing,being unsure. With my son,I found out he was a boy at 13 weeks,and yes,he was definately a boy!|`|m1RTNmqsaa	I had my ultrasound done at 17weeks and a few days & it said I was having a girl.    About 6weeks later my mother had her 17weeks ultrasound down & It showed a boy. You can see if perfectly clear!    Congratulations!|`|Ra8cdjbDaa	If the doctor said it was a boy, I'd take his word for it.|`|wLe7nBLGaa	lol...i would feel the same way too...but if you saw his little package...congrats to you. i would trust the dr. although their are cases that they are wrong but at 17 weeks i think they are pretty accurate. i'm so jealous i have 2 daughters and im pregnant only 13 weeks and praying for a son.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Well it's fair to say that if you see a penis it's a boy. If they don't see a penis it can go either way. Congratulations! Looks like you have 2 girls with a boy on the way.|`|5WYeHh0paa	I sure hope so because I really want a boy and thats supposedly what i'm having!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	Well not 100% until you give birth    but they may be able to confirm at the next ultrasound  or a 4d ultrasound because they are a little more clear...go about 28 weeks|`|YK8P5rNXaa	I felt the same way when i got pregnant with my 2nd baby cus my first baby was a girl and i wanted to be pregnant with a boy for my 2nd  and yes i sure was pregnant with a boy i even went to go and get a 4D ultrasound and he opened legs for me and i saw everything i was so happy.....,.|`|RMcFVXZNaa	Ultrasound is never 100% but they say if they tell u it's a boy it's a 75% chance that they are right verses 50% if they tell u it's a girl

She still has 2 months to grow till full term 40 weeks.  Also, ultrasounds are not 100% accurate. It can be off by a few oz.  Good luck with the new baby!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	those things can be off but it sounds very normal- there are babies born 10 pounds and some 5. my friend's baby was born at 33 weeks nad he was 3 1/2 pounds|`|rDsKB0uXaa	That sounds good    when i was born i weighed near 10 pounds|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hi yes its a normal weight and babies normally put on more in the last few weeks anyway because they lay down more fat then. dont worry i am sure they would have expressed any concerns they have if there was any. good luck.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	According to What to Expect When You're Expecting, it says at 32 weeks the baby is almost 4 pounds and about 19 inches long so you're right on track!|`|QrZcKRsDaa	I'm 32 weeks as well & I had a growth ultra sound the other day...my baby (girl) weighs 4lbs & 8 oz right now & the doctor said she's at the right weight.

Ar6wD9Oeaa	My son was that bad at 16 months.  I used time out. BUt i made it a unpleasant time out. the head had to be kept in the corner of the walls. I used a corner b/c it's so boring and kep them from distracting themselves.    Now my son is 3, and we rarely use the corner, but when he does do something real bad, he gets a stinger on the butt now. We rarely spank either. Its like occasionally. BUt my daugher is now hitting 16 months and she's been a real pill lately too! she doens't listen for beans. I think it s just their age group, they will grow out of it soon.    So, use a a corner, or spank a naked bottom.  DWhatever you do... DONT STICK HIM IN HIS CRIB as punishment b/c that could cause you problems with sleeping. He may think he's in trouble when you put him down for naps or to bed at night.    Good luck|`|fFqzD3aMaa	Time out 1 minute for every year he is old|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	You must be persistent.  If you place him in time out and he gets up put him back.  He is a toddler this is what they do it is up to you to ensure he learns proper behavior.  That takes time and patience.    Watch super nanny.    While I am all for a good spanking if needed.  Not on someone that young.  It has gotten old for you telling him to stop 100 times but clearly you have to tell him 200 times.  And mean it.  You can not give in one day and be strict the next day.    Patience and consistency|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	I think your son and mine would get along great lol, my son is 2 now but he started his terrible 2s very early also. But the best thing you can do is to not get mad, its hard, i know, but they arent doing these things to intentionally get on your nerves, they are testing their limits and pushing the boundries, its part of them growing up and learning and important for them to learn their independence, when he does something that could hurt him or break something try not to use the word "no", use "stop", and spankings dont really help because it doesnt really hurt and they dont see it as a punishment, as for time-outs, these i believe in, at that age the way i used to give my son a time-out was to hold him in my arms, constrict his arms to his side, telling him he was having a time-out and counting to thirty, they dont like feeling constricted so the more often you do it and explain what is happening the more likely he will stop something he is doing with a threat of a time-out. For me, ive accepted that hes going to make a mess, and i let him, i let him have his fun and learn in whatever way he wants, and now he will clean up his own messes without me even asking! as long as its not hurting him or damaging anything i say its okay. as they get older setting limits is definitely a good idea but for now whatever keeps him entertained, If he is throwing fits, at home the absolute best thing to do is to not pay him any attention, look away, or walk away and when he sees he doesnt have an audience he will stop very quickly...Good luck, and he will get passed it.|`|vexUqMGpaa	Hi, im really not sure whether he would understand time out. When he is ready for time out though do use it consistantly, its brilliant and works everytime for my kids. What about taking him away from whatever it is that he is doing that he shouldnt be (tell im he shouldnt be doing it and why) and calmly give him something else to do instead, its kind of like a distraction technique.|`|kmQqbxpQaa	I understand your frustration, but with the things you listed I agree with "do y our own thinking".  First, I  know many parents who have relocated their trash cans because MOST tots will get into them.  Same thing with the cabinets.  If you don't lock them then you are just teasing him by leaving them accessible.  His nature is curiosity.  This is what he is supposed to do.  At first, I thought you were talking about throwing tantrums and hitting and stuff.  But the stuff  you listed is typical and most parents work around their child and the fact that you are not willing to says to me that you are ignoring his age and what is natural for him.|`|9Z063O5Gaa	I agree with Danielle. I have been having problems with my almost 3 year old for over 1 1/2 years. I think her idea of "time out" for that age is a great idea. My 2 year old would never sit in time out or stand in a corner for 2 minutes. She would just keep getting up or getting out of the corner. I consistently put her back and she consistently gets back out. It is a huge power struggle and after 3 hours of fighting, she usually wins. I actually took her to a behavioral health specialist and parent coach and they had no idea's for me. And don't listen to those who are putting you down. Until they have had a child like him, they don't know what you go through.|`|AA11210211	ohh yeah I know what you mean my son went through his phase it was horrible,I think he is old enough for time out and you could also try taking his favorite toys away from him.Also is your SO deployed or TDY right now,that could be a factor in it too,when my hubby use to be gone my son would act out??|`|68c6B8dRaa	Stop hitting him, for a start.    He may be walking and so on but in many ways he's still an infant. No, he doesn't need time out.    It doesn't even sound like he's misbehaving. So what if he can't sit still? He's a small child; that's what they do. You need to adjust your expectations re. a 17mo listening to what you say; you'll both be much less frustrated.    Distract and redirect with a kind 'no' when he's doing something he's not supposed to; don't smack him. If that's the best you can do discipline-wise now, you'll be taking off your belt when he's six. Come on...
eya1WDS4aa	Its gonna be hard but tons of men and women do it all the time. You can do it, it will be tough but if your waiting for a perfect time, that perfect time doesnt come when you are in the military. Im an airforce wife my husband was deplyed from the time our son was 4 months till he was a year old and it was tough. Im pregnant again with our second and yes its gonna be tough doing it with two kids but it can be done. Im gonna be doing it. My husband at the moment could get deployed at any time. We could get a phone call and bam he could be leaving. IF you really want another child then you can do it. Just have faith in yourself.|`|fMxVDps3aa	When my ex-husband and I decided to have our 3rd child he worked out of town. I know that's a little different than your situation but it all works out. If you have one you can do two. And so on and so forth. I am now a single mom on my 5th child and its not that bad.|`|a3cb80b66a772a6b621fcf095945a298aa	i had done this twice...the first time he left for training on oct 16(i was due oct 22) got induced on the 30..he was at the hospital that night at 7...was here for 3 day and then left again for training....and he didnt get back home from his deployment till she was about 8 months....i was lucky to be statined close to home and  i took my 6 weeks at moms house and everyweekend when home to get help..and we just had our second child on the 16 and he will be leaving again in mar....and hopefully coming back in nov..i can say it is hard cuz you will be the only one to clean feed and take care of the house and kids....but youy can do it...plus of your pretty close to the people in his shop they should be able to help.....my shop and my husband shop were there to help me...i dont kow how it will be with two just yet but im think it will be twice has hard cuz you do have two kids to care for....and yes they would have an older sibling to play with and learn from...|`|SDjrojZXaa	when my husband was deployed we didnt have our son yet and i had WAY to much down time so for me the bussier i kept the more sane i was because i wasnt thinking about how lonely it was without him. yes 2 may be a little more challenging but there a many people who do it all the time. I think it would be fine. Thats that hard part about the military you dont want to put your life on hold because of deployement. Do you have a good support system?well I would try to get a place where you can live on base or in a government housing developement because then you will have some people around who are going through what you are and there are many young families on bases. they usually always have nice safe playgrounds and you can have playdates.|`|XOtOMncwaa	My fiancee has worked away from home since my son was 2 months old, and he's a year now, so I'm here by myself 24-7, with an occasional week where my fiancee comes home... it's frustrating at times, but I'm so used to it now that's it's harder when my fiancee comes home, if that makes sense... we've been bringing up the thought of maybe another child sometime soon more often now and I have a feeling that we will be TTC sometime here soon. I don't think it will be that hard, at least I don't think it will be any more hard then someone who has someone else at home to help. The thing that is hard with my son is that I'm spread so thin, I have to do housework by myself, and I have to take car of my son by myself, so when I'm trying to get things done sometimes he wants to play, so instead of going to get daddy he wants ME to play, and that's the only thing I have a problem with right now, so we figured if I have another one when the new one gets a little older they will be able to occupy one another so I can get things done... of course it would probably be even harder then it is now but everyone learns to adjust to any situation... 3 years ago I don't think I could have spent the whole day with a toddler without losing my sanity, but I've done it for so long now it's just second nature... so my answer is, of course it will be more difficult in some ways, and easier in others, its all in how you adjust.
wzXJOSIeaa	Do the robot instead...lol    On a more serious note don't do anything you are uncomfortable with and you will be just fine. Just hang out and visit with friends. I mean it's not mandatory to dance. Have fun!|`|ySKK7lCyaa	don't dance like that dance how you want.|`|9zwSclnLaa	Just don't dance like that.  It only makes you look like a slut anyways.  Find a group of people you know who are just talking, or doing normal dancing, or go get a drink or something to eat.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Take pride in the fact that you are not a fan of 'freak dancing'.|`|Fp0cN6Miaa	Do what you are comfortable with, most likely many feel the same way and will dance with you or not dance with you if needed.    Another idea would be to not go to the dance and just do something else fun, get a group of friends and hang out at someones house or do something else.     Make your own dance night.|`|uQyrxxmIaa	Well if your not comfortable with freaky dancing then you shouldnt participate in it. Do whatever you feel comfortable with, sit down and chat with others that arent dancing either. There is other things than dancing to do at parties.|`|3varN1KKaa	then dont go|`|FklngtvCaa	I'm not comfortable dancing like that  either, when it gets so hot and the whole  dance floor moves into a big circle with people  grinding in the middle... ugh I hate it.    I usually just talk to some friends off to the side,  pretend I don't notice and get a drink, raise my eyebrows  and complain how disgusting it is to whoever's nearest  to me, or go to the washroom.|`|hstwNjNaaa	Go and get a drink/something to eat if people start 'dancing like that. Go talk to some people who aren't dancing. Just go and find something else fun to do!
rTACLd3Saa	Ok, last question before bedtime, LOL!  Avary will be a year old Thursday.  At her last checkup (about 1 1/2 months ago) she weighed 20 lbs 4.8 oz. and was 28 1/2 In. tall.  (50th percentile accross the board).    Her schedule may be a bit different than some because I co-sleep.      She gets her first bottle (8 oz.) around 8 or 9 AM (Whenever she wakes).  She actually plays with my hair or runs her fingers gently accross my back or face (depending on which way I'm facing) until I wake up, then puts all her fingers together like she's picking something up and puts it in my mouth to tell me she's hungry.  She started doing it becasue I try to teach her signs for different words like "hungry" or "more", etc.  Well, the sign for "Hungry" is to put your fingers together and bring them to your mouth a few times.  I showed her how to do it but she thinks the sign is to bring her fingers together and bring them to MY mouth!  It's so adorable I just had to share that, even though it has nothing to do with your question, LOL!  So, anyway, Avary gets up at 8 or 9 and has an 8 oz bottle.  She usually doesn't want to eat breakfast until around ten-ish. (she's a late day starter like me).  Then she will usually have some yogurt with banana and a gluten free banana waffle (she may have Celiacs).  Then she'll have a snack of something like a handful of her special puff cereal or a piece of cheese, some fruit, etc. around 11:30.  She usually takes a second bottle (6 oz) around 12:30 then we have lunch at about 1:30 or 2:00 PM.  For lunch she'll have whatever I can whip up.  She loves her gluten-free pasta with a little cheese or sometimes mixed with a healthy puree I made and froze (I've always made most of her baby foods), I try to make sure she gets at least 3 food groups at each meal.  Then she takes a nap around 3 PM for anywhere from 1/2 hour to 2 hours.  When she gets up we usually play for about 1/2 hour then I give her some watered down juice or a yogurt smoothie around 4 or 5 PM.  We do dinner around 6:30 or 7-ish depending on how the day went.  For dinner she has some meat (usually chicken - especially since I found these great pre-cooked grilled slices of chicken from Purdue!  They are awsome and Avary LOVES them.  I just cut it up in little chunks and she goes to town.  I also give her some veggie - like a half a sweet potato or sometimes I mix some veggie puree into her brown rice cereal.  She also likes quinoa and other grains.  And I often give her a little fruit or yogurt for dessert.  SOmetimes she'll take another 6 oz bottle around bedtime (9 PM) but usually not.  Then, when I go to bed I go get her and take her in bed with me (usually between 12 and 2 AM) and she gets another warm 8 oz bottle then.  It may not be the typical schedule but it works for us and she's healthy and happy and that's all that matters!|`|8wnvhBQTaa	My twins drink anything between 10oz and 16oz. They get 8oz before bed & formula in afternoon but sometimes they don't drink it tey get cows milk mixed in their cereal.  Breakfast - Bowl of cereal, toast & fruit & drink of juice.  Lunch - Sandwich, scrambled Egg, omelette, pasta, etc followd by a piece of fruit & water.  Dinner - meat, veggies, potato or rice & water.  Snacks - fruit or baby biscuit.    Weight are a guess.  Girl - around 21lb  Boy - around 25lb    I don't know there height they were last measure about 8 months and were above the average.|`|TJusfEnlaa	My son is nearly 11 months and he only drinks 16oz of formula now. He was still getting 24oz but he wasn't interested in the afternoon feed, so I have replaced this with a sippy cup of whole milk, and he usually will drink around 3oz.  He has a 8oz bottle in the morning, and an 8oz bottle to go to bed.   He has toast or cereal for breakfast, yoghurt and fruit for lunch, whatever we are eating for dinner, and snacks on rice crackers, fruit bars, and cheese.  I haven't had him measured since he was 8 months old, he weighs 10.5kg.|`|pXSKSS3daa	At that age Noah was was drinking around 22 oz. but we were also starting to incorporate whole milk as well.    Breakfast-Yogurt  Lunch-Whatever I could find. Usually a meat with some veggies and fruit  Dinner-Whatever we were eating unless it wasn't good for him(fast food).  For snacks he has fruit or crackers    Weight: 22 lbs. Height 29 inches. I'm guessing, though.|`|DLDweOcYaa	At 11 months my daughter was drinking 2 to 3 bottle a day (150ml in a bottle).  Her weight at the time was about 20lbs.  Her food consists of porridge in the morning, pureed meat & vegetables or pasta for lunch, yoghurt, custard and pureed fruit for snacks.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	my son is 10months, 23lbs and I am not sure of his height at the moment.    he has 8 oz when he wakes at 8am   "Breakfast" at 10 is toast with banana/oatmeal or yogurt  8oz bottle after nap  "lunch" around 1pm is fruit/cheese/or tofu  "dinner" around 6pm is chicken/green beans/veggies like carrots, peas, corn/mashed potato/or whatever we are having made baby friendly :)  8 oz bottle right before bed at 8pm.    snacks in between all that consist mainly of cheerios , gerber puffs or yogurt melts.|`|6RkLr3Uaaa	Nath is born 03 may and he has cereal for breakfast ....hates anything mush so we just give him cereal with no milk... wheet bix or nutra grain , something he can pick up , sometimes toast too... then he will have a bottle    Lunch is usually a sandwich with light spread of cheese or vegimite or some sort of spread , fruit , maybe sometimes he will have pasta or leftovers from dinner the night before    dinner is family foods now  we do alot of meat or chicken veggies and salads basically whatever we have ill just chunk it up for him, same as Michelle , unless its unhealthy ( rare! )   we tend to make our own pizza , which he loves , nuggests and chips , baked in the oven and lots of baked veggies or steamed etc ...  snacks he still loves the rusks ( is teething ) and has some rice crackers , cheese chunks ( not a real fan) and some bread ....just about anything going .... he had a bottle after breakfast , one about 3:30 in the afternoon then at about 8 pm before bed another one .... about 220 ml    he is 29 pound 13.5 kg) and 89 cm long ( unsure of the inches)    hope the answer serves you ..    :)  big love
jaP0TANdaa	Well, have you not seen a spike at all? This would most likely mean that you didn't ovulate. Where are you in your cycle? If you have ovulated and haven't seen a spike in your luteal phase (a triphasic pattern or consistently high temps) that doesn't necessarily mean you didn't conceive. Some women have not had any change in temp during their luteal phase when they conceived, other than AF didn't come and their temps never dropped back down. So, there's still a chance! Good luck to you.
Emc2XOJWaa	Ugh, I would be upset too!  If something like that happens the parents of the children should be notified so that they can make the decision for themselves if they want to pick up their child, or if they are okay with leaving them there.  I would say something if I were you, but try to be calm about it. Just let them know that if they have a problem like that in the future you would like to be contacted so that you can make the decision to pick your daughter up or leave her there.|`|AE0nK4Q3aa	Yes and no. it's great you're concerned, and thinking! I would probobly take her somewhere else untill the AC gets back on, but I wouldn't press charges or anything. if it's summer and hot, deffinatly not over reacting! it just depends, but just take her somewhere else until the problem is fixed, if you even like that place anyways.|`|I13UuI9faa	overreacting no way!! When my son was young he couldn't take the heat very well at all.So if it had been me oh yeah I would be upset! A small child can NOT take the heat like an adult, they can suffer heat stroke easily. So yes demand they call you next time ac or heat situations!|`|U6lQVtF5aa	I think you are overreacting.  The heat obviously wasn't dangerous to health and they may have thought the AC would have come on sooner than it did.  Should they need to call every time their power goes for a few minutes?  I think they made a judgment call and it worked out fine.    I'd also note that many parents would have yelled at them for bothering them.  You weren't one of them, but parents in general are finicky...so I think all parents should give daycare workers a bit of a break on the small things like this (whether the parents are yelling about the daycare workers calling them or not calling them).|`|6EnQYZEOaa	Well no not really be realistic I wouldn't want to receive a phone call cause my day cares air conditioner is out I don't have the option to leave.but you can request they call you next time my next question would be did they do anything or attempt to do anything to keep them cool?open windows,fans etc.. if not then yes by all means go off|`|AkFag8tNaa	Maybe a little:) We didn't have air conditioning at all in my elementary 'til I was 10 and there were some pretty hot days. I think if that situation happens, there should be back up fans and lots of trips to the water fountain.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	you are not overreacting...they should have called!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well, yes i think it would have been appropriate for them to call the parents and let them know of the situation so that they could have the option to bring home their children however I think that some parents would be mad if a preschool called for something like that so maybe that's why they didn't make any calls. don't get mad about it, instead when you take her to preschool again just let them know that if there is another situation like that, that you want to be notified so you can decide whether or not to bring home your daughter.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I think I would have complained actually. Your right you should have had the option to come pick her up, if the children where going to be sitting in a sauna all day|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I don't think you are overreacting at all. They should have called the parents and let them know what was going on, that way you had the option to go get your child. I would definitely tell them that if something like that ever happens again you want to be notified so you can come get your daughter.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	Did they do anything to help keep the kids cool? Fans, ice water, anything?     It's too late to do anything about it now but, yes, I would probably be upset. Was your daughter really hot when you came? Depending on how she felt at the time, what the day care providers were doing and how I felt at the time would judge what I did about it.     Just let them know that you would like to be contacted in cases such as this. Many parent's probably wouldn't have the oppurtunity to leave work which is probably why they didn't call anyone.     Make sure she wasn't overheated and that she's feeling okay. DId the workers apologize and tell you what they did to help?|`|gHIEbYM9aa	No,you are not over reacting maybe the kids could get to hot and sweaty    It's not good for the children you should go tell them|`|6cfb6cd3197d1e471020aecf96fc5902aa	I don't think your over reacting.  I guess what I would do is tell them that you are upset that they didn't let you know the a/c was out and to have it put into your daughters paperwork at school that if the a/c isn't working properly they are to call you as soon as the problem arises so you can pick her up.  They have to follow your wishes.|`|3Qxqh68xaa	If when the a/c went out they knew that it would not be immediately repaired, then you have the right to be annoyed.  But if most kids leave at 3pm and they were hoping for it to be quickly repaired, then give them the benefit of the doubt. And depending on how many children there are.  Was it worth calling the parents of each and every one on all their different contact numbers, or waiting a couple hours with the hope that it would be fixed anyway.|`|eya1WDS4aa	I dont think you are over reacting at all. If it where me i would have said something right then and there. They should have called and told you!|`|EcKLqBnCaa	Well, I'm not going to lie, you do sound like you're overreacting. There was a time when there wasn't any air conditioning, and people did just fine. Plus, 3 hours isn't a big deal, at least big enough to bother parents at work over. Now if it was 3 hours in a non-air conditioned bus, yes, there would be cause for concern, but generally, buildings don't get dangerously hot like an automobile.     My air conditioning was out for a whole month last summer, and I live in Texas where it can get 100+ degrees Fahrenheit. My family and all my animals did just fine, though admittedly we weren't too comfortable (but hey, we all need rough patches.. can't get too spoiled living off of today's technology!)|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	I don't think you are over reacting, but if the children are okay and well taken care of, I don't think they would think to call parents.    I worked for a few daycares and we had the A/C go out in the summer time.     We had all the windows open for the breeze, fans going and didn't let them do awhole lot of gross motor skills unless the children had swiming clothes (which many do as we had alot of water activities) and put the sprinkler on or the slip and slide. (Must require sun screen).    You can talk to the director and request if happened again that you would like to be notified just incase.     The only time we called parents if the children had signs of over heating or sick. We always had spray bottles to spray the kids down every 15 or so mins.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	You are not overreacting!  I would speak with the director/owner of the facility and let them know that you are not happy.  Sometimes it takes an event like this to force them to come up with a game plan for the next emergency.  Do not let this slide- EVERYTHING that happens there is your business because you are the one who cares for/protects your little girl!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No.They should of called.I remember in high school and being a senior (last year)our a/c blew and it was summer and 100 degrees and they even called our parent to let them know.And we are talking about 14-19 year old kids.Not little ones.They called them to ask if they could give us ice packs and popsicles and stuff to keep us cool.They should of let the parents know.
AA11048627	hey mandy i think he is the spitting image of you but with his daddys dark features|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I think he looks an awfully lot like his dad.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	You have a beautiful family. I think your son looks like his daddy more.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I think he looks like his daddy, with your eye brows... he sure is a cutie!|`|i2wbADHbaa	Awww he looks like a good mix of the two of you.  You are such an adorable family!!!   Your son is gorgeous!|`|b10aMPdOaa	He is soooo cute.  You must be very proud.  I think he looks more like you than your husband.  But as he gets older he'll probably change.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Hmmm.... hard to tell with the hats.  Honestly, I think he looks like his own little person at this age.  All babies do in my opinion.  Its not until they are older that they really start resembling their mother or father.      He seems to have your face shape and eyes, but he definitely has his father's enthusiasm and smile (or lack there of).  lol|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Aww what a cutie! I think he has your eyes, but it's hard to tell from a picture!|`|f8e72c6f0fb6056040e7f9fa1c5247aaaa	Babies look the same.|`|9Ycuoysjaa	Your son has his fathers eyes but looks more like you.|`|r9gBoBLCaa	NAAAWWW! Your son is a cutie bo bootie!!  I think he is definately more like you. But then in the picture of all of you, he is a spitting image of his daddy. You and your husband don't look THAT dis-similar, so it's hard to tell.|`|9HUjDaBVaa	I think he looks like both of you but has your partners nose.  Lovely christmas photo!|`|f1c3e4fed0bc8c4bf3636c69cd65cebfaa	I think he is a perfect combination of the two of you! He is beautiful!|`|tWP8GDyGaa	I think he looks like both of you!|`|yNvyuBSnaa	A little of both, cant really say you or dad from the pics maybe as the child grows you will see it more then|`|QOITXwDIaa	I think he resembles both of you.  In that picture of the 3 of you, he looks more like his dad though.      You look so young!      Congrat's!  No matter who he looks like, he's gorgeous!|`|wAWDyFr2aa	I think he looks more like daddy but with your eyes.|`|AA10316293	What a beautiful combination of both!  He has your nose and chin and Dad's eyes. Couldn't see the ears. Eyebrows look like they might be yours too.
3EhoJ42zaa	Wait until your appointment tomorrow.  I am also 37 weeks and for the past week and a half I have experienced the PMS feeling, the bad cramps that come and go, and just the overall feeling of crap.  IT's ALL normal, baby is getting into position in your pelvis cause your pelvis to literally spread and widen.  This is what causes the cramping and discomfort in the lower back, hips, inner thighs, pubic bone etc...  There is no point in going to the doctor or calling, all they will tell you is to wait until contractions are 5 minutes apart, when your water breaks, or when you cannot speak through a contraction.  This is all part of pregnancy.  Only three more weeks.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I would wait until your appointment.  The cramping could be a sign of early labor or it could not.  Either way, you're probably not going to go into labor  before tomorrow.    Just hang in there.  This is the toughest part, but it doesn't last forever.  You'll barely remember it once your baby is here!|`|DD5CMWfkaa	I am 37 weeks and 4 days, and for the last week I have been feeling this exact same way. I seem to be getting more and more irritable like PMS! I sure hope this baby is coming out soon..|`|5l0yJWYdaa	first you need to calm down and breathe. your just getting closer to having your beautiful baby.wait for your appointment and take walks. relax the baby is getting in the right position for delivery|`|X2EPEEwbaa	Trust me, when you are in labour, you will know!  It feels unlike anything else.  And hormones are funny things - especially when you are pregnant.   I don't think you have anything to worry about, unless you are in so much pain that you can't handle it - then go to the hospital!    Perhaps the baby has twisted around and that's why you're in pain?  Maybe you are experiencing Braxton Hicks?  Since you have an appointment tomorrow, I suggest waiting until then to discuss it with your doctor.    You could also try visiting www.whattoexpect.com and searching there for some answers.  I found it to be very helpful.|`|ooadGX6Laa	HI, I am 37 weeks and 6 days. I have been feeling exactly the same, also been getting bad nausea, diarrhoea, cannot sleep for more than 1 hour at a time, slwollen ankles, I cant even get up the stairs without feeling breathless. I feel totally and utterly fed up to the point I sometimes sit and cry and plead with my bump for it to hurry up and come out. But its just one of these things that we have to put up with, much to my distress, but baby will only come when it is ready. I have also been getting very bad period pains and backache, but been told its all just natural at this stage of pregnancy.     Good luck hun tomorrow, I go see midwife tomorrow too so hoping everything is still ok. xx|`|8KF9LApQaa	It could be signs of labor. You should wait it out though because labor can start and stop again. If you relax and make sure everything is ready for the trip to the hospital or birthing center then just wait until contractions come on at intervals. If you listen to your body you will know when it is time. If this is your first baby you will have time to get to where you need to go. If this is not your first then labor will probably quickly progress. If you are not high-risk then sit at home and relax because going to a hospital early will probably make labor take longer and be more uncomfortable. I am going to school to be a midwife so if you have any other questions email me at SarahMommy86@Yahoo.com|`|2ihS0wwraa	call your doctor because if you are in labor that would be bad at your home!
zkFuXoNDaa	I colored my hair when I was pregnant.  I probably did it once each time I was pregnant, too.  (4 times)  All four of my girls are just fine.  What you wanna do, is buy the long rubber gloves, the kind you wash dishes with. (They're only 3 or 4 bucks)  That way more of your arms are covered.  And be careful not to get it on your skin anywhere else.  Just try to ONLY get it on your hair and scalp.  Now, once you get it in your hair and scalp, the dye will set REALLY fast if you put a gallon size ziploc bag over your hair!  NOT JOKING!  Just rip the corners a little to fit it over your head, and the color will set in almost five to ten minutes! Then you can rinse it out!  I'm not kidding! Then you don't have to worry about it soaking into your skin for very long.  WORKED FOR ME!!  Hope it works for you!|`|9Ycuoysjaa	I advise you not to dye your hair especially while your pregnant, as your hormones are all over the place at the moment and our scalps are very sensitive too hair colourant. If your really desperate to dye your hair go to your nearest salon and ask them to do a test patch on your hair to see how it reacts.i still would advise you not to do it.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	As long as you are past 12 weeks, and the area is well ventilated, it's perfectly safe.|`|r5wLhpgqaa	i colored my hair when i was 3 months pregnant. nothing happened, i was in a salon too. i would get your hair colored in a salon, talk to a stylist, they would know for sure.|`|96qrn9kLaa	Actully, the reason they tell you not to dye or use any types of chemicals on your hair has nothing to do with the development of your child!     1. If you choose to use these types of chemicals on your hair during your pregnancy, make sure that you are some place that is well ventilated! The fumes are what they warn you about, because the fumes can cause you to pass out or on some rare occasions die.     2. During your pregnancy you have extra hormones that change the texture of you hair and if you're used to doing these things to your hair while not pregnant, you may not get the same result during pregnancy because of the extra hormones.     I have 4 children and 1 more baking in the oven, and i've relaxed my hair and even dyed my hair during my pregnancies and my children were all born, happy, healthy and just fine! Its just a personal choice...its that's what you want to do, just take the necessary precautions when you do. Good luck with your pregnancy.|`|oDY9XqSoaa	I asked my midwife and she said it was fine in a well ventilated area i did it once or twice whilst pregnant but if you have doubts ask your own midwife|`|EwcAR5bwaa	Wait until the second trimester, and I would just go to the salon to have it done.  First of all, the do it yourself at home hair dyes contain more ammonia and chemicals.  Second, your hair during pregnancy is different than usual, it may take the color differently.  Personally I'd rather have someone who can fix it if something goes wrong do it then risk doing it myself and having it turn out all crazy.  I had my hair dyed in my 5th month, I'm 8 months now and baby is very healthy and active.  I also know a lot of people who dyed their hair while pregnant at salons, all their children are perfectly healthy and normal.  I even know some stylists who worked dying hair the entire time they were preg.  I don't know of anyone who dyed their hair themselves at home though, so I can't say for sure about that.|`|FeMJDEcIaa	If you look at the research online about hair coloring,   it's fine there's no findings that state it's harmful to your baby.  As long as you are not bleaching, and make sure to keep the area ventilated there should not be a problem|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Its not recommended to dye ur hair while pregnant because the chemicals can hurt the baby. Would u really take that chance just to change ur hair color?|`|hWc65sEtaa	After the first trimester is fine as long as it's in a well ventilated area.  Use one that doesn't have ammonia or bleach in it.|`|EULVtVDvaa	You can color your hair when pregnant I did all through my last pregnancy and my baby is FINE . If it was not safe my hairdresser would not have done it . Just because you are pregnant it doesn't mean you are dead and have to look frumpy . Geesh some of these answers .|`|i8Ch743Laa	I did mine ALL THE TIME. Even before 12 weeks. My daughter is fine. Women are freaking out about EVERYTHING anymore. It's fine,just make sure you're in a well ventilated area. There's been NO link found between hair dye and anything wrong with babies. My daughter was born at 40 weeks,defect free,perfect lungs,etc. There's no issue while dying your hair. Just really really make sure you're in a well ventilated area :D Happy dying!     EDIT-My Aunt does mine,she's a licensed cosmetologist. Has been for 20 something years,and has never seen anyone have any types of issues from it. I did mine from 8 weeks on with my daughter,(not professional,she didn't do those ones) but all she told me was that some color may not take the right way,because of the changes in your body.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	According to my Dr. she says the only reason not to color your hair is during your first trimester the fumes may make you nauseous. Other than that there is nothing that can harm the baby.|`|UtOVEzG3aa	well i asked my doctor and he told me it's safe as long as it's after first trimester, Still i would recommend to talk to your doctor before you do it, but i heard and my doctor told me it's safe, i already did it and now i am 20 weeks pregnant! good luck|`|hVVALFAPaa	Don't take a chance with your babe's Development. Go natural for the next few months.|`|fPX1lD8uaa	Coloring your hair is okay.... just make sure that wherever you do it, it's ventilated enough so that your not ingesting all those smells.  I would actually suggest you have someone do it for you.|`|GjXEoiMbaa	YES U CAN BUT WAIT AFTER THE BABY MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ARE DEVELOPED. SO WAIT UNTIL AFTER 3-4 MONTHS PREGNANT|`|zc9ZhoMIaa	Ask your doctor! I asked mine about hair color and nails. He said both were fine to do. But to be safe check with your doctor! :)  I always used color at home kits through out my pregnancy.|`|z1YM1Xniaa	If you can dye your hair your natural color and just let it be until after you deliver. But if you absolutely must, like to cover grays and such, then try the level 1 or 2 hair dyes. They have less chemicals in them than the permanent level 3's. You may have to touch up once a month but it is better for the baby! baby comes first!|`|WLtsumGBaa	ive wondered about this too. many ppl have very different opinions about it. many woman do it and many women dont. salon stylists say that its ok. some women say that the chemicals goes into your bloodstream and can harm the baby. some say to wait after your first trimester. i hear pros and cons about it everywhere. and since im on the little paranoid side about things i just perfer to wait it out. i have cut my hair short and my whole head is my natural color now. my ends still have a tiny tint in them but its hardly noticeable anymore. so i might just regrow my hair midback length and keep it my natural color.    u never really know. so just on the safer side i didnt do it at all. but ive known women who have used the non amonia dye. who knows! but im gonna wait =)
v0GwTTsVaa	What about Eva Sloane?  You can still call her Sloane.  My hub goes by his middle name.|`|h57t7FAjaa	Hmmm... that's a tough one to put a mn with.  I would personally use it as a middle name, and find a nice cute first name to go with it!  It could always still be used as a nn too.|`|KM6wXvy9aa	Rosie|`|XRzSxgUnaa	Sloane Marie    Sloane Elizabeth      Sloane Brielle        Sloan Shyanne|`|2Cw0DfaSaa	NOT MARIE!!   every girl/woman i know has that middle name.. thank god my mom gave me a good one.     you might like it...

How about     Sloane Reilly....    For a middle name, how about Jessica Sloane|`|K542Db29aa	rose  danielle  lynn  marie
2WfHLUyOaa	Darling if they ave a problem with it... you can say.... AHH IM PREGNANT AND THE WELFARE OF MY UNBORN BABY IS MORE IMPORTANT THEN SOME STUIPID EIGIT WHO GOT HIMSELF INTROUBLE AND IM EXCUSED BECAUSE I HAVE TO BE AND IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT FINE BUT IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO MY CHILD ILL SUE EVERYONE OF YE,... ITS YOUR CHOICE.. they will excuse you|`|XOnk1rBcaa	Legitimate excuse. Ring the jury service and tell them.|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	If you mail in your letter now with your drs excuse just tell them you need to reschedule your jury duty time to another week. You shouldnt have any problems. I had to do the same but for work I was the only accountant in office that week so we sent in my request along with a letter form my supervisor and had no problems they rescheduled my jury duty about 2 months later.    Good luck !!!!|`|o5Ez7Gyraa	a doctors note will get you out of it, call the courts and talk to someone to be 100% sure, but my mom gets out of it w/ a note has a few times!!|`|AA10953561	Actually, they excuse people from jury duty all the time. I had a jury duty summons last spring, but I was still in college. So I called them and asked to have it delayed. They were really cool about it. If you can't get ahold of anyone by phone can you go in and talk to someone? I would keep calling if I were you, explain that you have a potential for miscarriage and that you would like to rearrange the date of the summons. As long as they can still count on you for jury duty they'll probably be willing to work with you.    Good luck!|`|OMOuxROoaa	you will be excused it is medical the judge will see it your way.|`|EDwlTWLwaa	it's highly unlikely that you will NOT be excused|`|AA10419781	call you can be released on a medical especially if its a high risk pregnacy|`|fPX1lD8uaa	If your doctor writes them a note excusing you from jury duty... then I believe that they will accept that.... but be prepared to get called back shortly after.|`|S5v9I0y2aa	I think you should be fine with a doctors letter.  I am sure health reasons are good enough to get out of it.  But try the office again until you can reach someone.    All the best and congrats!|`|VvU76vJxaa	First of all don't worry or panic over this situation because you need to maintain a healthy stress level for yourself and the baby.  Your medical needs trump all things so the note from the doctor will be sufficient.  If it is not too much trouble maybe you can go to the court clerk's office and drop off the note or explain your situation.  In any event if you don't show up for jury duty they will just send you a new date.  Either way it goes this will work out fine, so don't worry.  My wife miscarried a few years ago, but became pregnant 2 years later.  It was discovered during her first prenatal visit that her (I'm not sure I'm spelling this correctly) pitocin level was low.  So make sure your doctor checks yours.|`|ryvO8DMaaa	I'm sure they would understand.  I got a jury summons at the end of my pregnancy last year.  They didn't give me an exact date...they just told me to let them know which of the 3 following months would work best for me.  At that time I was 8 months pregnant.  I went on their website to respond and told them that I was getting close to the end of my pregnancy and that I would also be having gall bladder surgery soon after the birth of my daughter so I wasn't sure which month would work best.  They sent me an email the next day excusing me from it.|`|grBxTsK6aa	Fax the excuse to the court, but call them first and get the right info on who to send it to.  Or you can drive over to the courthouse prior to the date and let them know.  Take the dr.'s note with you.
QhVCn7rsaa	It's probably just the braxton hicks.you baby maybe engaged  - head down, by now but the contractions are your body's way of getting you ready for the real thing.    Good Luck
wZAeBisbaa	For this child's own good, he needs to learn how to express his feelings less aggressively, and his parents should be on board with this.   He may be jealous or angry.  Children can learn young that everyone has these feelings, but it's not OK to use physical aggression.      I have watched professional early childhood teachers deal with this.  They would help the children verbalize their feelings.  If the kids were too young to talk, the teacher would help them find words.  "You don't want Brody to sit on that chair."  "You want that car, but Brody is playing with it."  They would gently hold the child who was being physical and stop them from acting out.  Depending on how old the child was, they would either encourage him to negotiate for what he wanted, or they might help him find something else to do.  They were letting the children know that physical aggression is not OK, and they were demonstrating alternatives. This seemed to work well.      But I think if Julius's parents aren't with you on this, you might want to find other playmates for Brody.|`|cJ1hizgHaa	Put them in a play pen.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	It's typical behavior, the older child is a bit jealous of the newer one because of all the attention.  Toddlers can be very mean and you shouldn't leave them alone together, even for a moment.  In time they'll work it out but they'll need coaching.  Try to give them things to do that require cooperation.
8aXDhia7aa	Actually now that you mention it...they also feel like water balloons.  In fact, I think they kind of felt like that before anyway....|`|xwMWfuBTaa	mine feel as thought they have sunburn!    My boobs are full and firm, they feel like i did about 2 months after my boob job :P|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	leaking balloons at present. Wait til you get to 32 weeks and your boobies feel like they've been pumped up by a bicycle tyre and are about to pop..
sxecXFgraa	I know most people on here are saying, you're the parent and put your foot down.  And to a point they're right.  But have you tried explaining to her why she shouldn't have it done as a friend not as a parent?  Or explained to her why you don't want her to have it done, other than you don't want her to?  As one poster said, most places won't pierce a 13 yr old's lip, but some will.  And it's not that hard to do it yourself.  My 14 yr old niece just did it.|`|RuyLwzA0aa	Stand firm.  She wont do it herself...and if she tries, she will learn her lesson.  It is ridiculous for a 13 year old to have this done.  When she is 18...she can poke her face full of holes- you cant do anything about it.  Let her know that if she does attempt this herself she will lose all priviledges.  Take her phone, computer, tv, etc.  If you have to- take her door off so you can watch her.  You have a long way to go with the teenage years- you better let her know who is boss now.|`|Vgk8VnXwaa	If you don't like the idea, you have to ask yourself "Who's the boss here?"|`|AA10727113	I would say lay down your rules and stick to them.  If she does it herself or has it done then have her remove it.  If you give in on this one then what's next?  The lip piercing has been found to push the gums down as well as destroy the enamel on the teeth.|`|2WK2UoPyaa	I was almost in the same boat. my 13 year old wanted her belly pierced. I shocked her by saying yes when she could when she turned 15. set a little time to make sure she thinks about it. but don't push every thing to 18 i think it just makes them want to grow up faster and leave. give in on some of the smaller issues and they listen better when the big stuff comes up. If you always say no to stuff like this they will stop asking and start doing it and hiding it from you. tell her when she is 15 or 16|`|xH3cIAuxaa	Any reputable piercer will not do anything but earlobes on a child that young without written parental consent.|`|PMpvtKUwaa	you're the parent. Start parenting and put your foot down.|`|fCo8IwO3aa	NO.  i think im still young, 22, so i can relate and remember how peer pressure was everything in school, but really, at 13, she does not need a lip peircing. if she really insists, fine let her, because i can almost guarantee every school has some kind of rule about facial peircings, and they will make her take it out and it will close..or maybe she can learn the hard way by having it ripped out while shes sleeping because it got caught on her pillow...happened to my brother years ago.  Good luck..i know i am not looking forward to my son being a teenager lol|`|n7uoE9wmaa	She should not be able to at 13 unless he can convince the piercer she is 18 or goes to a back street piercer.  Piercings are nasty and can get infected|`|FswuiOIjaa	let her do it.   Then get the whole family to point at it and laugh EVERY time she comes in a room.  It would be even better if you all make descouraging coments as well.  It'll be gone in a week.  worked with my sis|`|38fe66cc26fd24d41aff94bf6ba97574aa	I agree with the person who said make wait until she is 15 or 16.  If she still wants then, make her pay for it herself.|`|5a4cf9a8abccef7317f553fe72d748ccaa	let her do it.  i begged my parents for an ear cartilage piercing when i was 13. i finally wore them down to let me get, and low and behold, i couldn't keep up with it, got bored, took it out and it closed up. as long as it's alright with the school dress code, i say let her. more than likely she'll get sick of it and take it out. if not; it's just metal. there are sooooo much worse things a 13 could get herself into|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I wouldn't allow it.  I would make her wait but be prepared to hear a LOT of whining about it.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I agree, wait till shes 18.  Shes only 13, and wants a lip piercing, whats next belly button, eyebrows, tounge?|`|7MJSPGnhaa	At 13 she wouldn't be "insisting" anything in my home.  Lay down the law if she goes behind your back and does it anyway than force her to remove it, let it close up and that's her money wasted.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	That you should keep your foot firmly planted on this one.  Maybe compromise and say she can get it when she's 16?|`|1tmX7xbRaa	she's 13 and you are the parent. that's it. first of all most schools won't allow kids to have those kinds of piercings as a part of the dress codes and they could in fact make her take it out or suspend her until she takes it out so first I would read her student hand book. then all i have to say is if you tell her NO and she is dumb enough to try and pierce her own lip then let her put herself through that pain and make her take it out anyway. she is 13 years old NO parent should put up with ultimatums from a child. and if she is going to be a brat about it take everything possible away from her. what I mean is when I was that age my mom went so far as to literally take the door off of my bedroom - her reasoning if you can't respect this houses rules then you don't have a right to privacy- it's something that has to be earned.
9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. Sadly pregnancy symptoms and period symptoms are soooo much alike that you cant really tell just by symptoms alone. I passed many months thinking that I was pregnant and it was always my period and this past month I was like wow i am def. getting my period and turns out i am pregnant! So you never can tell unless you take a pregnancy test!!!! So it could go either way! hang in there tons of baby dust!!!|`|DN6XtoViaa	you would be 10dpo so you very well could be feeling pregnant :)  your BBT rising is a good sign too!     Hope you get a BFP this cycle!   Good luck!
be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	You could have symptoms this early. You can get symptoms as soon as implantation occurs and you have pregnancy hormone in your system.    I always had symptoms before my missed period.    You could be pregnant BUT early pregnancy symptoms can be really similar to AF symptoms (They are caused in part by the hormone progesterone which is present during the second half of your cycle and during pregnancy). And when you are TTC you tend to notice things more than you would normally.    Good Luck!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	sure but usually symptoms don't arise this early but i would wait a couple days andd test|`|UtOVEzG3aa	well why don't you take a test, since you missed your period, honestly i don't think pregnancy symptoms doesn't show up that early though, not 5 days after your conception, that's just tooo early, usually it takes about 6 weeks to start show, but i don't know, try to take a test and see goof luck|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You could be! Go get a first response hpt that has 2 tests in the box. Take one first thing in the morning and if negative, take another one on Monday or Tuesday when you are late. Good luck!|`|S5v9I0y2aa	There is a chance.  Test when you get closer to the day your period is due.  All the best!

jN3pRKkEaa	1. Get her in Sunday school or evening church classes so she can be exposed to a different environment.    2. Spend 30 min of one on one time w/ her a day, like you said doing crafts or whatever.  Tell her that you will work on yours, she will work on hers.  When she tells you how to do it, tell her every time that everyone is diff and has a diff way of doing things.  Find projects that have a lot of creativity and do yours totally different, concentrate on letting her know it is OK to do it different, she will get it eventually.    3. This sounds strange, I know, but it actually works.....watch Super Nanny with her.  When there is a child on that acts like her, point it out to her that she acts like that.  Ask her what is wrong w/ the child's behavior.  Ask her if she likes being viewed that way.    4. Find an activity to do w/ her where she CAN be the leader and teach others how to do something, it would be a good idea to have a family nite where she teaches you guys to play a game only she knows how to play, but also have the same type of day where her brother is the teacher and she and everyone else has to listen.    5.  Look at your relationshp w/ your husband (or ex or significant other, whoever) or mother or other adults you interact with around her.  How do you treat them and how do they treat you?  Can she be getting this type of influences anywhere else but at home.    Just my ideas...I have an 8 yo that seems to go thru ups and downs in the attitude department and it makes me miserable sometimes.|`|AA10757819	I have noticed that my daughter would pick up bad habits from one of her friends if she spent to much time around her. I put a stop to that.|`|hlq3Eo0haa	exactly like my daughter who is a teenager now.nothing worked for me but i am just greatfull that she is honest and does not drink or smoke. u can yell and take away things but as u know it does not work,but what u may consider is jealousy over her brother,my daughter lets it slip that our son is spoiled and the favourite,try asking her if she feels 2nd best.good luck as you are going to need it, the hard years are coming up|`|TK03jZTuaa	I would definitely restrict her friendships until she changes a few attitudes. and I think you possibly need to take a look at the Total Transformation Program. I know it helped me as a parent to learn how to react to my child and do things differently to help her.  I wish you well.|`|PiqojaIraa	Pulling it out, only option.|`|bYAoWnyYaa	Hmm im sorry to say but it sounds like shes 9. Most 9 year olds are begging to feel the strain of puberty but don't quite know what it is. So  they get bossy and evil. Lucky for you this does calm down.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	the problem is YOU. your not doing your job as a mother....and where is the father?|`|r07BwhO1aa	It sounds like your daughter is just going to have to learn how to be a friend on her own, eventually she will tire of not having friends, not getting invited to play dates, and so on.    As for the blatant disrespect she shows you, with the eye rolling and so on, I don't know how you feel about spanking but heck it is never too late to start, you already said talking does not work.    Good luck.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	It is borderline age of no return - almost too late to "reform" her.  Where was the discipline (with love) the first 8 years of her life?  How many electronic gadgets does she have in her room?  Does she get everything she wants?  While I applaud you as a certified teacher (K-9), maybe you need to think about being a parent and not a teacher.  Parents are teacher also, but not in the same manner.  Have you sat her down and told her in no uncertain terms that you are the mother, not her?  What role has her father been in disciplining, teaching her, setting an example, etc.?  Too many parents use "stress" as a cop-out.  We all have stress in our lives and need to learn how to cope with it.  I wish you well with this problem.|`|SDiNKp8oaa	My sister is JUST like that. Really it's phase they go through. My mom has had 5 kids, and almost all of them have gone through it. They were all girls too. For boys it is different. She can't make up her mind about her friends and thinks she knows everything. I have gotten so much bossiness from her and some smacking around.  Even though I am older than her, I still sometimes just wanna hit her. Her friends are the SAME way. Also, when her friends spend the night, they usually get left out or end up sleeping in my room. I was never like that. It was because I was not outgoing, and if she was shy like me, then she would have really good friends like I do. She is at time of trying to find who she is. But, be careful, in middle school, some trouble might come along. Trust me. I've been there, done that, don't wanna go back to Middle School. The people there are just so... like her, but more complicated. I got home schooled, and that was my best option yet. Still getting good grades since 1st grade. Some of the richer kids her age are like that too. They think they are more valuable.  Anyway, good luck.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Oh, my.  Spare the rod, spoil the child....  And guess what?  You should have already had the talk with her about sex, too.   If she is acting out this way, sex will only follow.   I say this as my sister was the same way.   She is still mouthy (plus more) and she is an adult now.    She may also feel threatened by the smooth relationship with your son.  Sit her down and talk to her. She is a preteen. It will only get worse if left to go on.|`|0SeDvhJ9aa	She needs a spanking.  You should give her one the next time she is sassy.  Before you spank her sit down with her and calmly explain what she did to get the spanking and what she can do in the future to avoid getting another.  After you spank her make sure that she understands why she was spanked, that you still love her, and that she will get another much harder one if she ever sasses you again.    By spanking I mean 3-6 hard swats on her butt with your hand.  Definitely do not beat her, but make her spanking memorable enough that she will never do anything to risk getting one again.|`|YCqnmsrFaa	Raise your voice a bit at bad times if you usallly don't. Only at bad times  not always or she will ignore it after a while. She have a phone? email? Computer? Something she loves? Threaten to take it away if she continues to be mean to her brother. Something she plays with in the car, and starts being sassy say: "I will throw that toy out the window." She roll her eyes?.. Be true to your word, throw it out the window. I used to be sassy when I was very little and grew out of it. Now I am strong, sweet, intelligent and helpful. Only because my mom did those things. I realized I was horrible, when you have time go on a vacation and separate her from her friends. As for school I can only say private school. I was home-schooled. I don't adapt to my friends though, I never did.|`|M0KLWw54aa	she's jst a child be patient with her, as long as she's not violent you can explain things.|`|lFlapW8maa	sounds like you are doing everything right except for she is not to old for a good ole pop on her bottom or her mouth with she sasses you.    it is not child abuse.  sometimes children need that physical shock to realize what they are doing is wrong then you can rationalize with them.  i am not saying beat your child.  but she does need to know you are the boss.|`|js5zxWCqaa	Well it sounds like a friend of mine.  When we met she was the outgoing one and I was soft spoken, I didn't quite take to her at first but she kept pursuing my friendship and we end up becoming best friends until one of us moved away.  In the beginning when we finally became friends I noticed how bossy she was to her mother and mean to her brothers and probably still is.  However she never once was mean to me or spoke to me rudely, I think she just needed a friend who was patient and who could put up with her like I could.   My own mother was sure to put me in my spot and let me know who the boss was the minute I sassed or got out of line and not by spanking but just by giving me a good well deserved lecture and it worked.   I now have a 12 year old daughter who occassionally gets an additude and of course, I give her the lecture.  You may not think your child hears you... but they do.  I know because I remember almost every word of the things my mom talked to me about.
BTuFtui3aa	I think we have to find a balanced view of this, like all things. The problem with "determinism" of any kind is that it's so grim, and that's not really an accurate picture... people rise above unfortunate circumstances all the time. I do think that the author has a good point, that having a negative early childhood experience isn't a sentence of doom for the rest of the person's life.    However, I also do believe that the first part of life, especially the first 3-5 years, has a major shaping effect on who we become. Abuse, neglect, and lack of attachment can lead to major issues, including things like trust and ability to relate to others.    I think it has to be understood, though, that 1.) Infants are pretty resilient, so we're talking severe neglect here, not that mommy let the baby cry it out once when she was feeling overwhelmed. No parent is perfect, and that doesn't mean that everyone damages their infant. The damage done in early childhood comes from extreme circumstances, not ordinary imperfect parenting. 2.) Therapy and effort later in life can overcome some of the challenges posed by damage done to young children, so people-- especially older children-- shouldn't be written off just because they didn't have the best start.    Personally, I take the view that early childhood care and attachments are important, but not the be-all and end-all of life. There's always room for healing and improvement, including for people who had childhoods that worked to their detriment.|`|ETcBRko3aa	I tend to disagree with this I think.  The first 3-5 years is extremely important in future outcome of a person's life.    Abandonment, abuse, neglect, etc in early childhood leads to problems in later life.  There is CLEAR scientific evidence that show that people who experience constant "stress" have a damaged hippocampus.  When the body is under stress, it releases a hormone called cortisol, which helps the body adapt to the stressful experience.  However, studies have shown that continued high levels of cortisol actually damage or destroy cells in the hippocampus.      Additionally, researchers have compared the size of the hippocampus between those with chronic PTSD and those without PTSD.  People with chronic PTSD have smaller hippocampi.      Read this  http://www.sfn.org/index.cfm?pagename=br...  http://www.hno.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/...  http://www.ipce.info/library_3/files/gla...    So, the brains of people who experience alot of stress are hardwired differently.|`|nESfk0bXaa	"It may well be the case that extreme emotional deprivation in the first two years of life can have devastating, irreversible consequences."      I would say that losing your mother at birth, as adoptees have, would fall under the category of 'emotional deprivation', and I think the 'consequencess' are 'irreversible'.|`|3mRDSilraa	I skimmed it and i think its like everything else. If you want to find a link between two things you can.|`|2seYOGxNaa	i have 1 biological child and my partner does as well. both are girls and they are 4.5 months apart in age. the 2 fathers are friends we picked to match each birth mom's appearance and manner.   anyway, what i'm seeing is that nurture means nothing, natur/genetics is really the underlying cause of everything.  the toddlers have been raised together since birth, but couldnt be more different! they look like twins to a stranger, but their personalities are polar opposites!|`|ybt605Qfaa	I think that it SUCKS.|`|vwTyihvvaa	I myself was pre-exposed to alcohol and drugs during my biological mother's pregnancy with me.     I was put into foster care from birth and raised by my foster parents who are my adoptive parents and have been so for twenty years for all my life. A loving, caring home, considered one of the best foster homes in the city, and all of us siblings have done well.    However, from the year of two I started suffering from severe anxiety out of nowhere. As time went on so did my anxiety issues. By the age of thirteen I  was suffering from anxiety issues, OCD, panic attacks, chronic depression and mood swings.     At the age of fifteen, I met my biological family, mother, father, siblings and BINGO! My biological mother has many mental issues, one of my siblings has the same emotional problems I have, my biological father also has issues.     So, for someone to tell me that my environment played a role, well once I met my biological parents it seemed more so that my genetics played a stronger role and regardless of where I was raised these issues would have surfaced.|`|c92d48030d0612c8b4dec267d2dd1d86aa	Interesting, but in my experience as a teacher most of the kids I've been in contact with who came to their parents after three years had lots of problems.  Most of the parents were caring, loving individuals, but eventually the kids rebelled against their upbringing.  Not sure if it's simple teenage rebellion or something in their past, but it's definitely there.
b8f0CfSsaa	You can test on the day your period would be due, but my GP previously advised me that if you wait a week until after then and use a brand such as Clearblue you are more likely to get a true reading. The tests rely on the HCG levels in your blood which are produced when pregnant, home tests can only detect beyond a certain level so if you do a test and its negative its advisable to wait two-three weeks and do another.    The early tests are around 70% accurate (or however accurate they state on their packaging). Again it depends on how high you produce HCG, however they won't give a false positive as once HCG is there it means you are pregnant! Beware of false negatives though.    The only guaranteed early result is from a GP blood test.|`|qmslHwj3aa	Wait till 2 days before your expected period.  Those tests are expensive if you take one now it might say negative when you are really positive.|`|pR4nLjyRaa	The tests that say can detect pregnancy 6 days before your period are reliable for some women. It all depends on when implantation occurs. It takes 2-3 days after implantation for there to be detectable amounts of hcG in your urine. It's best to wait until the day your period is due to test to avoid false negatives which can be a real bummer! If you have an idea when implantation occured though you can start testing 2 days after that. For example I knew that I implanted 9 dpo my chart showed that, and I had cramping too. I tested 2 days later and got a +.  (3 days before my period was due.) If your able to handle false negatives theres no harm in testing early. Good luck!
sUysQCxDaa	Hi! We must almost have the same due date because I am 39 weeks and 1 day! I am not sick of being pregnant, but at the same time I am so ready for her to be here! I feel ready. I feel big and tired and just want labor to start now! Last night I had a burst of energy and this monday I was dilated 3 cms, though not really effaced at all... I don't know when she will come and it is frustrating to me. It is so hard to be patient!    Good luck to you and maybe our babies will have the same birthday!|`|7e0e7ff256c190317c5cec259f29a8f3aa	I am 39 weeks 3 days. This will be number 2. I am due on Monday!

Now with my second I have felt great (excep the first trimester I Lost 10lbs because of the morning sickness).  I have all this energy and I have the perfect text book pregnancy.  About two weeks ago is when I started feeling heavy and uncomfortable.  Now at 37 weeks I am just so ready to be done.  I feel like I have been doing the splits for weeks, my sciatic nerve hurts in my back all the time no matter if Iam sitting or if I am active, I am sooooo tired of peeing.  I get contractions in the middle of the night that wake me up and when I get ready to start timing them, they stop and I get so angry, I also have the worlds worst heartburn.    This second pregnancy has definately flown by though.  It seems like not long ago I got the positive on the pee stick and now I Am getting ready to deliver.|`|aLkCxq5aaa	I'm now 36+1 weeks and like you, felt pretty good throughout this time and the past 8 months have really flown by.  Until the last week or so.  Just all of a sudden it came on that I wanted this baby in my arms and not in my belly!  And ever since I've been feeling pretty miserable and uncomfortable. I've been having all sorts of signs that the end is near so I seem to spend my days wondering what each twinge/pain and niggle is!      With my 2nd pregnancy I suffered from S.P.D. from 12 weeks so was in agony for pretty much most of the time and didn't enjoy the pregnancy at all.  This is my 3rd pregnancy and am glad to say it's gone pretty smoothly, the S.P.D returned but it's been managed with physiotherapy so not been in so much pain.      So for me it's now just a case of being impatient and the excitement of finding out if I'm having a girl or boy! Oh and for an end to all the niggles and uncomfort too :)     Good Luck to you for the next couple of weeks, xx|`|ooadGX6Laa	Hi, I am a bit behind you, I am 38 weeks tomorrow, and I am SOOOO excited, but also getting very impatient now and still got 2 weeks to go!

SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    It may not be to early for implantation, some woman can have this around 4dpo, it just depends on your body and how quick things run.  For the wetness, when all the semen leave your body it can be a bit of a mess, as its also mixed with the egg white CM that is around the time you ovulate, and this will be coming out with the semen, because this is what helps them up to the egg.  Also after ovulation you may get cloudy discharge that maybe a bit watery also, so all this together can create a bit of a mess.    Stress can cause cramping, and also prevent the egg from implanting.  Here's a link explaining stress and prevention of conception.  http://www.mesicstraining.com/stress-inf...    I hope this information helps you out.  Best of luck xx|`|AWdUdVD4aa	The cramping could be ovulation pain. However, stress could possibly cause cramps, too.  Since you are unsure it would be best to wait a few weeks and see if aunt flo arrives.    I'm not going to lecture you, but if you are not ready for the responsibilites of a child then wear protection. Not to mention, just because you aren't having sex with other people doesn't mean he isn't. I would rather be safe than sorry.    Good luck to you.
E2h4QuxKaa	It's darn near impossible for a baby to get cold or flu sick during their first 6 weeks of life because they still have such a strong immune system in their little bodies from their mother.  Unless your baby has a weak immune system for some reason, I wouldn't worry about it AT ALL.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	Hi yes your husband should be able to hold her but be careful obviously. yes sometimes it brings on labour. i had a urine infection at 38 weeks and i dilated 1 cm but luckily they caught it. good luck.|`|9ffa956c569429ec4edaa430974fd5a1aa	Maybe they will make you two wear a mask over your mouth and nose when in contact with the baby I was in labor and the lady in the next room from me had pneumonia during labor that had to not be good on her body ,good luck

QhVCn7rsaa	It could have been an embedding bleed - when the fertilized egg embeds itself in the lining of the womb you can experience some light bleeding.

0sJsTN83aa	If you have the SSN, you can do a background search for about $40, this should reveal their address and maybe phone number.  Landlord's do this all the time, and I believe you can go online and do this with a credit card.  Once you find her, she's probably the easiest source for tracking down your bio father.  Without his SSN, it's hard to know how easy/difficult he may be to find.    Be very prepared though, not all reunions go favorably.  Giving a child up for adoption is very difficult and your bio mother has probably already coped with the idea of never seeing you again, so this may be a big shock that she needs time to mentally deal with.  She may also have a new family that doesn't know she previously had a child.  I would very strongly suggest to enter the situation carefully and slowly with a letter.  If it was a closed adoption situation, she has privacy rights in this as well.|`|4TqERLSgaa	I don't know if you are up for this or not, but this is how I found my father after 40 years.

gSteSrogaa	I just took a trip with my 2 kids (almost 2, and almost 3). I thought I had this wonderful idea of having the flight late, and then they would sleep. All that caused was two cranky kids! I would go with trying to find a flight during the day. My flight back was during the day, and went much smoother.    You have two choices here: Get a window seat for the 2 year old. Both mine were fascinated by the window during take off and landing. Or, my daughter was potty trained, and I liked the aisle seat because I didn't have to disturb anyone when I got up a dozen times to take her to the bathroom.     If they like movies. Try to get/borrow a portable DVD player. I was on a 5 hour flight from WI to CA with my two! This comes in handy and kills and hour or two. Bring their favorite movies. Also, a set of headphones. I don't care how low my DVD player was, the stewardess requested that I use headphones for the kids.     A blanket and maybe a small pillow for nap time. Mine took turns napping on the plane. This was nice as I only had to occupy one at a time.    Coloring Book with markers. I suggest Color Wonder markers and a brand-new book so she doesn't mark the plane up and will have plenty to color. Or, get a magna-doodle with the pen attached. Then she can draw without dropping the markers (one thing my daughter kept doing) someone was always handing me a marker they found on the floor. Oh, and I didn't bring all the markers. I only took 3 markers.    Snacks.    My carry on included: the diaper bag for my youngest and a small suitcase with wheels for my daughter. In the suitcase was toys (DVD player, movies, coloring book, crayons, etc...) to keep her occupied.    For toys, I would stick with ones without took many removable parts. Don't take things like megablocks or doll houses with dolls/clothes/furniture or anything like that. Stick with one-piece type toys. For my son, we got a Sesame Street steering wheel with levers, switches, etc...he could play with.    Her favorite toy. My daughter has a stuffed animal she always sleeps with, I brought that.    I don't know how advanced your daughter is, but I have a My First LeapPad book. This or something similar would be great for the plane. It has several pages with several activities she could play to keep her occupied.    Other things to bring would include: diaper wipes/napkins for wiping up quick spills. A sippy cup to pour your daughter's drinks into (they don't have lids/straws on the plane). My daughter got a little scratch before take off and threw a fit over not having a band-aide for the blood, I ended up begging other passangers for a band-aide (haha...I got 5 handed to me right away!)|`|cv5wGV8Caa	get a portable dvd player and pack lots of toys and snacks. use starburst for landing and takeoff to help with the pain of the airpressure. goodluck. i have done the same on a six hour flight and it is hard but can be done. sorry but lollypops do not work it is the active chewing that relieves a childs ears.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	i bought a Leapster.

q1Swxe3qaa	I got my daughter a cradle swing, the rain forest one. It plays music and rocks back and fourth like she would if you were rocking her. I would just wrap her up in a blanket and lay her in there at night for a little while. It used to get me an extra few hours of sleep at night!  Otherwise you could try co-sleeping. Just lay her in bed with you, I used to nurse my daughter laying down, which was great because I could sleep when she did.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Try several different shape pacifiers, she might not like the one you chose.

I just lay in the recliner with her for now. She has reflux so she has to sit up after eating. During the day I put a blanket in her car seat to cover the buckles and wrap her up in a blanket. Once she is asleep I can usually lay her in the car seat and she will sleep for a little while. I pull the blanket up around her so it feels like Im holding her. She hates a pacifier as well but if I dip it in her formula and give it to her she will take it sometimes.|`|VmNR14T7aa	Hmmm well you could try to get her into a routine. Like give her a bath in the evening wait a little while then a last bottle about 9-10 in the evening, go to a dark room maybe with a little bit of light, put some lullabys on rock her, let her fall asleep on you then put her into her crib/moses basket :)|`|SR0hYSqGaa	I got 4 kids and the trick is to not pick them up straight away when they start crying, leave it a litle longer each time.  When you pick them up they are getting a reaction.  It sounds cruel but try leaving her a little longer each time she crys.  As for the pacifier try different types or put something sweet on one.

DKqsFGymaa	She's ready if her pull-up is regularly dry in the morning.    If it is, try panties.  If it's not, but she really wants to wear her panties, compromise for awhile with wearing the panties over the pull-up.  Explain to her that the pull-up has to be dry in the morning before she can quit using them.    If she's still taking naps, I would try just panties during naptime to see if she can make it that amount of time.    A rubber sheet on the mattress will save the mattress, but make sure you have a couple of back-up sets of sheets for the accidents.    Good luck!|`|de641317a0696a8d53df9d1538305a2baa	Pull Ups are one of the reasons why children aren't successfully being potty trained!!!  Plus, have you ever tried to take a pull-up off when there's a big poopy mess in there?  I watched a mother do that once and I gagged!  It's easier to take off the thick quilted training pants.  Unfortunately, it's so hard to find them in the stores because Pull ups have taken over.    If she wants to sleep in her panties, let her! Leave a light on in the hallway so she can make it to the bathroom.  Make sure her bed has a rubber sheet under the regular sheets.    Another FYI - read John Rosemond's series of books on rearing children.  His potty training sections seem strict for today's standards, but are exactly how our parents were trained as toddlers, and it WORKED!  Good luck.|`|o7wGYLZ5aa	They sell extra absorbent blankets.  She is ready, if she told you so please take advantage of her offer.  No liquids after 7 and make sure she goes to pee right before bed when you wash her teeth.  Make that a routine.  She will be fine.  If you wake up at night take her to the bathroom with you.|`|hamdnq5Yaa	Use the panties.  Watch the liquids to late before bed. Put her on potty a few times before she goes to bed.  It takes a few trips to the bathroom to empty there bladder all the way. Hope  for the best. Never get mad if she pees her bed.|`|oDyNiJi7aa	The wonderful stage of potty training. My daughter is 3 and potty trained.  When it is time for naps I put her on the potty and when she wakes up I put her on the potty.  When it is in the evenings I stop giving her liquids at about 7:00pm and when it is bed time I put her on the potty and when she wakes up in the Morning I put her on the potty.  She is doing a great job at this.  If your daughter is having accidents maybe there is change and she doesn't like it.  If you and your spouce is having issues that could be something she doesn't like.  I do wish you the best of luck!|`|gSteSrogaa	My 3 year old is also insisting on wearing panties at night. I have tried explaining to her "not until you wake up with dry diapers"...we put her in diapers. Occassionally, I try to put her to sleep in panties, but she will just wake up in the middle of the night crying because she is wet.     Things that I have heard. Don't give them anything to drink about an hour or two before bedtime. Ask her before bedtime if she has to go potty. If you really want to try...does she have a plastic matress on her bed? I would probably just put her to sleep with a couple of blankets (instead of a fitted sheet) for quick clean up. Just pull the sheets off and a quick wipe-down of the matress to make changing the bed easier if she does wet it.

It looks like you should have had sex just a little sooner in your cycle than when you did to help your chances, but you may have still caught your window of ovulation.  Just wait a few more days and see what happens.  You're so irregular, you may not even really be late yet.  Your period may be just around the corner.

I'm not saying that is what it is, but since you are having pregnancy feelings I would research that and definitely go seek medical advice.    Signs and Symptoms    Ectopic pregnancy can be difficult to diagnose because symptoms often mirror those of a normal early pregnancy. These can include missed periods, breast tenderness, nausea, vomiting, or frequent urination.    The first warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy are often pain or vaginal bleeding. You might feel pain in your pelvis, abdomen, or, in extreme cases, even your shoulder or neck (if blood from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy builds up and irritates certain nerves). Most women describe the pain as sharp and stabbing. It may concentrate on one side of the pelvis and come and go or vary in intensity.    Any of the following additional symptoms can also suggest an ectopic pregnancy:        * vaginal spotting      * dizziness or fainting (caused by blood loss)      * low blood pressure (also caused by blood loss)      * lower back pain        Best of Luck!!

If parents can't realize that children come first in life and before them, then that's pretty bad.

Your Temperature would of spiked due to the hormones all rushing around and your body being confused at how fast it had to change.  The pelvic cramps will be where the eggs attached and things are starting to move fast.    Best of luck and i hope you get the results you want  xx|`|RuyLwzA0aa	It could be!

q51cevqLaa	You need to start charting your cycle.  Day 1 is the first day of your period.  Count from there.  Figure out how long your cycle is.  Most women who ovulate regularly are on approximately a 28 day cycle.  Your most fertile days are mid cycle.  If you are having 28 day cycles, days 13, 14, 15 are your most fertile.  Have sex on those days.  You would think it is easy to get pregnant, but actually, timing has to be pretty precise.  Another way is buy an ovulation kit.  Available at Walgreens, Walmart, etc.   ClearBlue Easy digital is pretty straightforward and easy to use.  But if you don't want to go through that hassle, I just suggest you have sex mid cycle every other day at least.  The problem is the three times you had sex, weren't the times you were fertile.  Good luck!    EDIT:  As for going to the doctor, if you are under 30, you need to try for at least a year.  Over 30, 6 months.  That is most doctor's rule of thumb.|`|HGDVgyJTaa	You have to learn when your ovulating to get pregnant, thats the only time it can happen, heres a link to a web site that has a fertility calendar that you personalize. I suggest that once you get an idea of when you ovulate get some ovulation predictor tests. There Pretty accurate and a good investment  http://www.yourdays.com/ovulation-pregna...|`|YtSGbYqEaa	everyone is different i tried for 2 years and when we stopped trying for a baby it happened and now im 14 weeks pregnant and healthy as far as you period goes im not to sure ask a doctor or maybe its nothing dont scare yourself in sure your fine i wish you the best of luck and god bless you|`|bIMtnIcIaa	G2 THE DOCTOR! And get tht diagnosed! YOu should seriously get tht checked out! stop waiting for answers from here and just G2 the DOCTOR! Plz!|`|nkHFvGNxaa	maybe if it does not work you could have fertize his stuff in you
b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	It is very normal to have messed up cycles after a miscarriage.  I know this because I had one similar to yours and I was having very long cycles afterward.  I was trying to get pg but nothing was happening.  I went to an OBGYN and found out that while i was having periods I was not ovulating.  In your case though it sounds like you may have conceived again.  I would have a blood test to confirm either way.  It could just be hormones too.I wish you the best>|`|8y0837nlaa	I also had a miscarriage which needed a D&C  had a normal period 45 days later on Dec 23 and waiting for my period again i guess af decided to skip all january.. i tested on monday and it was a negative.  will be going to my dr on monday|`|AA12041870	You should go see a GYN.|`|hVVALFAPaa	You were pregnant. Your body had tons of hormones rushing through it. Then those hormones were gone. It is normal for them to be out of whack for several months, up to 6 months after the end of pregnancy or miscarriage. The pregnancy test may have shown a weird positive because you still have hormones from the earlier pregnancy floating through you.  Or there may still be little bits of it left in you. I would go to a doctor and take a blood pregnancy test instead of just the urine test. It will be more conclusive.    And I am sorry for your loss.
gdnL63ngaa	I will NOT say don't think about it. Of course you are going to think about it. Get tested at your MD. Get a full physical, as well as your partner and get his semen analysis.  We tried for 6 months and NOTHING so we got tested and there was in issue. We told the doc we were ttc for a year so he would actually test us, otherwise he'd make us wait till 12 months.    Fertility clinics can have a long wait list so get tested just to ease your mind, and get an u/s of your ovaries. You may have cysts.    Again, even healthy couples can take up to 12 months to concieve, so get tested, put your mind at ease or proceed with fertility treatments.|`|gwuTKiNXaa	try a tea called fertility tea it has high rating and it just might help you|`|vue9NOhYaa	5 months is not unusually long to be trying, and doesn't mean that anything is wrong.      If you normally have a fairly active/regular sex life, and nothing in your medical history to suggest a problem (regular periods, no history of STDs or PID, no excessive bleeding that might suggest endometriosis)  no need to do anything special ... you'll almost certainly be pregant within the next 6 months or so.      If, after a year, you're still not pregnant, see your doctor.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun! I am not trying to sound cold but it can take even the healthiest couples a year to concieve. So don't get down on yourself! I know that 5 months seems like an eternity esp when you want something so bad! I would go to the drs and start charting your BBT's! hang in there hun and tons of baby dust!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!        trust me it took my hubby and I a year to get pregnant and I had to go on Clomid and finally jsut got pregnant. So hang in there!!!!|`|IUnrYCx9aa	I'm going through the same thing and I feel your pain. I"m also 24, my husband is 28.  We've been trying for almost a year.  I ended up having a mc last fall and now I haven't been able to get pg again since.  Also, it feels like everyone I know is pg these days.    You're definitely still in the 'normal' range for how long it could take to get pregnant.  You may want to consider getting ovulation kits to make sure you are ovulating and to pinpoint when...although this could just add to the whole stress of the situation.    I would get checked out by my dr if I were you, but give it a few more months.  I really don't think you need to worry at this point about you or your husband's health baby-wise...but I know the feeling!
SBZOVEueaa	she is not 'needy' she is a perfectly normal baby    it is perfectly normal for a well loved baby to be this way (parents who believe you can not spoil a newborn by holding)    my baby was the same way (husband felt same way) and i didnt breastfeed    it means she has a bond w/you - you did good    no you shouldnt let her cry it out - it sounds if she is a very well adjusted social baby - just loves her mommy - enjoy this time - it passes so very quickly and they will start going to other people and not want to come back to you if they are getting more attention from the other person...(grandparents)    my baby is 11 mos and i have to lay w/her to get her to sleep or rock her to sleep or her daddy has to lay with her - it makes me feel good that she has such a bond with both of us - in fact it is great that she and my husband can go on to bed w/o me while i finish up house work    she will start having that same bond w/your hubby later on (sounds like she has it now just not as strong as yours, it will get just as strong) -     so dont worry - enjoy this time and let your hubby know it is normal and pretty soon he will be the one having to lay w/her to get her to sleep|`|wiAVa1H5aa	The only thing you could be doing wrong is describing your infant as "needy".  She's an infant, she's smart enough to know who her mom is and with whom she belongs, she belongs with you only right now.   In the future she will branch out, but her attachment to you is a good thing - just take her with you to the bathroom if you have to, I did - my sons would often sit in their car seat on the floor when I needed to use the restroom (so I could be sanitary).|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I think you are doing a great job! Your baby loves you and is secure when you are away during the day. After all that time away from you, she just wants your attention and to be close to you. She doesnt know when you will leave again (babies cannot predict things nor do they have a concept of time) so she wants to be near you always. I'm sure once she starts crawling and whatnot she will want some more space in the evenings but until then, I would continue on. Hopefully your hubby doenst get jealous or his feelings hurt in the meantime :( BTW I totally disagree with the Cry It Out methods. Studies have shown that babies who are allowed to cry for 10 minutes or more uninterrupted have decreased oxygen levels to their brains. Good luck!|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	you need to take this with a grain of salt, of course your her favorite, and theres nothing wrong with it. I understand how you would want a break and would love your husband to put baby down for the night, how about you take a long bath while your husband puts baby down for the night. I'm a mother of two and both my children were like that until around 6 months old, and then when they became more mobile, it was like daddy was their favorite person of all! In your case though, I would start slowly, have dad give her a bath, and a massage afterwards, and then you put her down, then the next bath time you bathe her, massage her, then get daddy to rock her to sleep.|`|qStmw7qgaa	She just needs her Mommy right now.  Something that might work is laying her on the floor (on a blanket) and then have you and your husband sit with her and talk and coo and laugh with her.  Keep your husband where he is at, and you slowly inch away, all the while cooing and talking to her, but make sure your husband is keeping most of her attention.  Keep inching until you are out of site, and see if she realizes you are gone.  My aunt and uncle did this.  It took a few times, but my cousin finally got the hang on of not need Mommy 100% of the time, and could be held by my uncle, even if my aunt was in the room.  Sounds weird, but it could work.|`|JvZY0ZS4aa	You're not doing anything wrong at all! Continue to keep her close when she wants to be with you.    My son was exactly the same way. I know that sometimes it can be quite tiring and draining on you, but it is really worth it. My son just turned 3 and is way more independent now. I really miss those cuddle times. He's also been enjoying daddy way more than mommy.    My daughter on the other hand was far more attached to my husband as a baby and often preferred his chest to mine. We each (my husband & I) have a great relationship with both of our kids so there's no need to worry about that.     Your daughter preferring to go to you and not your husband is no reflection on her love or need for him. Encourage him to just 'be there' as a support so your daughter knows daddy is there for her. As she gets older, she'll naturally transition over to him more - you may even be the one feeling left out! :o)|`|tQVBDx5Paa	My friend has a 15 month old that is similar to what you describe.  The only I can tell you is it got a little better when he started crawling and a little better again when he started walking.  Some babies are just like that I guess.|`|P2hhUsoMaa	My daughter was the same way.  She only wanted mommy and daddy though.  No one else could hold her or get to close or she would cry and flip out.  Everyone said it was just a phase, but it was from 3 months till atleast 18 months.  Thankfully she outgrew it and now at 2 1/2 she is not shy at all.  I don't believe in letting a baby that young cry it out either so I'd say just hang in there.  Sit close to daddy and have him hold your daughter.  Or let him try putting her to sleep at night and see how it goes.  My daughter still whines "I want you" to me everynight when daddy puts her to bed.  But she gets over it.  Thats daddy's time with the kids since he's at work all day.  Good Luck! I know it's hard and if it's a phase you may just have to wait it out.  I still remember my daughters 1st birthday party.  She was attached to my hip and I felt horrible that everyone came to see her and she would cry when anyone came near her.  :(|`|75ZxAANkaa	i think the reason to her whininess  is  that as a little baby she might feel that you are going to leave her and never come back. She is probably  so attached because she just wants to spend as much time with you as possible before you go back to work. IT is also natural that she is more attached to you than her father since you are the one that gave birth to her and since you breasfeed there is always a certain closeness between the mother and child. She knows who to get comfort from. you are right you cannot spoil a baby she needs lots of attention. She will adapt in time  once she realizes that you are home at certain hours and work at certain hours. your husband should not feel this way. your baby is only three months old so it is natural for her to only want mommy. when she gets old enough to wrestle with daddy and play with him she will realize how awesome he is|`|rOBTMriCaa	My daughter was the same way when she was a baby.  And we are still very close but she did eventually learn to be comforted by other people.  One thing that could help is letting her have some alone time with daddy at night while you take a shower, watch a show, read a book, take a rest, something in another part of the house where she can't hear or see you.  Let them bond that way, let daddy give her a bath, something that makes him feel like she likes him.  And yes eventually you'll be able to be in the same room and she'll stay happily in her daddy's arms, but right now that just probably won't happen.|`|SbBhTDtLaa	The baby has bonded with you so much, you are very lucky. One of my twin likes my husband, but the other has bonded with me.  Even I have the same condition what you are facing.  Try diverting the attention of your baby by giving some toys.  Give a chance to your hubby to massage the baby, give bath to the baby, and some eye to eye contact may help the baby to get attached to your husband.
qygYwdRpaa	Hi im not sure but i do know that any fluid loss needs to be reported at your late stage of pregnancy, you see IF your waters are leaking then although your baby will be fine now you are at risk of infection so i suggest you pop off and get checked out now!    Good luck hunny x|`|VFUdAtrHaa	you could of had a female orgasm.. You do leak alot when you have one. If no more fluid is comming out its not your water. Your water will continue to leak. I would phone the doctor just to be sure though. Good luck. I wish i was as far along as you.. im only 26 weeks lol
ZBXCz0GLaa	http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...    we used this one for my son who had reflux.  it helped us make sure he was elevated.  this helps digestion especially with infants because they tend to sleep right after drinking milk.      it worked really well, until he started rolling over.  however, that will be the case with any sleep positioner and babies.|`|ZIdhNsxPaa	I used plain nursing blankets rolled into logs laid on either side of my daughter under her chest and tummy away from her face. I don't think it really matters as long as it stays away from their faces and seems cool/breathable. Babies get very fussy if something makes them hot or sweaty.     On a side note. Its best to keep babies on their side no matter what, just try to switch which side you keep them on so their head doesn't get flat on one side. Their skulls are very moldable at infancy.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i can tell u that they aren't recommended...|`|UVwRSpDjaa	The first years brand is good and adjustable. It has breathable material.  I purchased mine at K-Mart. It's like $12 bucks
IXskJPlVaa	Do some research about fertile periods. Normally 3/4 days immediately after the periods and 3/4 days immediately before periods are considered safe - in between is the danger zone. But take nothing for guaranteed. Best of luck.|`|2QejTvhEaa	noo... its nt safe. may b she gets pregnant.  bt if u wnt to do it den ask ur wyf to hv emergency pills widin 72 hrs, available in all medical stores.. so dat she'l nt hv unxpctd pregnancy..
fFtBqFB6aa	yes|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	its one freaking day. WAIT.|`|tn9sL3Ncaa	you could be the best thing to do is buy a test good luck|`|mXYxRsB5aa	There is a chance that you could be but if the condom did not split or anything like that then it is a slim chance, i would wait a couple of days then do a test if your period has still not arrived   good luck
z0tn4PoAaa	If you're not having your period, and got two positives, then you are probably pregnant.    If you have two others, just relax, you know that you just need to start taking prenatal vitamins, stop drinking alcohol if you drink it etc. and unless there are any issues, you can wait for your appointment.    You're a pro!|`|i8Ch743Laa	No,you're pregnant. Tests show up with a false negative all the time,but it's really really rare to get a false positive. You've gotta either be on a fertility drug containing the hormone HGC,have a "chemical" pregnancy (I'm sure you know what that is,where a test comes up positive,you're late for your period,and then you start,so the egg doesn't implant) or the test is defective,whichh if you got two,that most likely isn't it at all. Good luc,and congrats! It's taking OB's longer to get women in becuase of the soaring amount of pregnancies. It took mine about three weeks to get me in as well.I would just calm down,your regular doctor won't be able to do much. Some women don't even realize they're pregnant until they are 3 or 4 months,and you've got other kids,so you know what's "safe" and "not safe".|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	if they were both positive, then most likely you are pregnant. the obgyn didn't want to see me until i was 7 weeks. so you're fine going feb 18th and you don't have to see your reg doctor.|`|lltD8BhAaa	YOUR NAME IS MIKE CORRECT ME IF I AM RONG BUT THAT IS A COMMON GUYS NAME    SO I FINK THIS IS A GUY    SO OF COURSE YOU ARE NOT PREGNANT.    BUT UNLESS YOUR A GIRL CALLED MIKE CHANCES ARE YOUR PREGNANT
s4LWmcTjaa	Not at all.  As long as the parent is a responsible disciplinarian and uses spanking in the proper context, it's a wonderful tool of discipline.    Child abuse is harming a child intentionally for the sole purpose of bringing pain to the child.  The person who abuses a child has no regard for teaching the child right from wrong, only to bring harm.  Spanking does not fall under that category if used properly and responsibly.  I believe it should be used for the most serious offenses only.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	WHEN DONE PROPERLY, no, I don't think it is abuse.|`|iOo9MAxJaa	If you cause bruises, bleeding, extreme hurt, then it's abuse.   A light spanking is alright BUT talking to the child is better and more effective.|`|jnG8sOzWaa	no it is not    there is a big difference between spanking and beating.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	No spanking is not child abuse...    Now if you are leaving bruises on your child this is abuse and shouldn't be tolerated also I believe that you shouldn't spank or scream at your children in public I think that is verbal and emotional abuse...Correcting them is one thing but to humiliate them is another...I also believe that a spanking is not necessary for all situations you can use other forms of discipline to get your point across right now with my son time outs are really working he gets really upset when I tell him no and this gives him time to calm down and let me try to explain my self.  even though he is 2 1/2 it really works for me! :)|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	Yes, spankings can be abusive. When spankings occur without explanation, it is not being used to discipline but to punish, I see that as abusive. I feel discipling and punishing are two different things but can go hand in hand. Punishing is when you simply want someone to pay by sacrificing, their comfort being the sacrifice. Disciplining is an attempt to get the child to see the reason why something they did was wrong, and prevent it from happening again. Discipling and punishing go hand in hand because sometimes extreme measures may be needed to try and prevent it from happening again- hence the spanking.     However, spankings as a last resort and in conjunction with other methods of discipline, and not carried out with excessive force, wouldn't be abuse in my opinion. For example, I have spanked my 10yr old son about 7 or 8 times, during his entire life. With the exception of me spanking him with my hand before he turned 6, he is usually spanked with a belt about 3 or 4 times across his butt. I have never spanked him without telling him why nor have I spanked him unless it something I had to get after him about repeatedly. I do not feel this is abuse. But, if whenever I spanked him, I hit him until he couldn't sit or was bruised or used something heavy like a bat or broom, I think this is abuse.|`|N6vEZVNEaa	HI IT REALLY DEPENDS ONWHAT THE CHILD DID AND HOW OLD IS HE/SHE BUT OTHER THEN THAT NO|`|kbIkVS0raa	No depending on how you go about it. I think that some parents take it to the extreme but if it is a simple spank on the butt then that is not considered child abuse. I learned this in my child abuse class. I don't really spank my daughter though because I have taught her that when I say something I mean it lol so that is usually all it takes.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I feel there is a difference between spanking and abuse.    Abuse to me if walloping your child. If your leaving a mark, causing extreme pain, your child is afraid of you, causing  bodily harm, using a foreign object ie not your the palm of an open hand, things like that, then yes I do believe it is abuse.    However a firm tap, is not abuse, It is disicpline.  If I thought my child, was afraid of me, because I spank her, I wouldn't spank her.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	No I don't think so if its a slap on the butt and the child is clothed. It's when bare bottoms and paddles, belts and other things are put into the mix that should be considered abuse. Also if a bruise or welts show up thenit is also abuse.    You can't always talk to and reason with your child..a spank on the bottom is sometimes needed.|`|7zf05NWsaa	It's not at all.    I was belted as a kid, and i came out unharmed.  I spank my son also.    Its works|`|4S6V4sb4aa	Well,,I am for physically correcting my children,, but a lot of parents can't draw that proverbial line between discipline and abuse.. You CAN'T BE UPSET if you decide that you have to take it to that level....I personally use physical discipline as a LAST RESORT, My father use to beat the hell out of me as a child and it put suck a negative impact on me,, When you deal with your child you are always dealing with the psychological and emotional part of them at ALL TIMES,, so be careful and Love is spelt ""TIME""|`|GqTSa85daa	When my daughters were young @3-5, I gave them over my knee, one swat on their butts...This was done once and never again and it was a light swat at that.  However, from that time on they behaved when I was around, and with their mother when she'd ask, do you want dad to give you another spanking.|`|AA11352641	Spanking a child is not abuse. I don't think it should be the first means of discipline, and should be reserved for major misbehavior. I was spanked as a child and I am grateful for the discipline. I never felt abused or unloved. I knew though, that if my mother ever got a call from my teacher she'd be waiting at the door ready to give me a whoopin when I got home. I never once misbehaved in school. Parents need to be authoritative, not a softie that can be walked all over.|`|JF343E2Taa	if u hit the child with unreasonable force yes a firm tap is ok but ther are other ways of discipling a child then smacking them|`|30PIgrYoaa	no|`|lTAORAPraa	no|`|3AKdZUgLaa	Well, babies don't know much since they don't have judgment yet. I wouldn't hit the child but maybe a nudge or a tap. NEVER laugh then they're doing something wrong, they might confirm that it's a good thing O: If you're parent I'll give you another advice :] Don't baby talk (aw boo boo boo) to your babies O: It somewhat makes them stupider x__x|`|FEb0qWoVaa	No.    In fact, the belt has always worked well on me.|`|dW9pFT9Daa	I got spanked when I was little and I don't remeber any loving moments between my parents and I. At the time they did it they were depressed and I couldn't see that as a kid. They use to let out all their anger on me. Today they refuse to admit they hit me that many times..but I wasn't stupid...  I think it isn't nessesary to do it unless you want your kids to hate you..idk..  Till lthis day I'm still afraid that my dad might raise his hand at me :(|`|2b4OFx5Oaa	Sapnking is fine. Beating a child is not. Too many people get this confused and then they end up raising kids who walk all over them and wonder what went wrong. Define that you will take disciplinary when warranted at a young age so your kids don't slide into "screw you"ville....|`|eYxAMRwPaa	It depends on the child and yourself.. I hope to not EVER have to hit (spank)  my kids.. I might not know my own strength, and my husband really doesn't know his, who's to say that what we think is a tap doesn't feel like a beating to the child. At this point I hope not to have to revert to spanking and swatting    good luck|`|MWym9QCzaa	This topic has become SO taboo. You dont even dare spank your child in public without consequences anymore. I was spanked as a child and was NEVER physically injured by it. (I think my ego was hurt more) :) I spank my daughter who is seven when she needs it. She really doesnt do much to get a spank, but if she needs one, she needs one. I think you should always use your hand to spank, never a spoon or another object, strictly because you will know if you spank your child too hard because your hand will hurt as well. Its harder to tell how hard you spank when you use an object. There is a fine line between spanking and abuse and I think you have to be careful not to cross it, but I seem to remember a certain VERY important saying. . ."Spare the rod, and SPOIL the child. :)|`|AA10665398	no, only if used for a last resort when trying to discipline a child. and i think it is abusive when you use a belt or anything like that. and if it leaves bruses or makes them bleed.   when i think to when i was younger, usually my parents only had to threaten to hit me and that would make me stop. but i know that for some kids actually hitting them might be the only thing that stops them from bouncing off the walls.|`|zWT6J4zTaa	Well imagine this, you know that kids that are never hit before will think they are the best and wont respect anybody, I believe that you should hit your kid but not hard, just like a tap on the hands or something like that, and in latin countries they do that, the US dont allow it but lots of ppl do it.      Check this out ppl.   http://www.piratamundo.com/z/richarjpg.h...|`|iSJFWFFkaa	my husband used to tell our kids "it's not against the law to spank your kids, it's against the law to leave marks".  i think there is a time and place for spanking.  rare and far between.|`|gEx05xSKaa	No. My parents spanked me quite often and i turned out fine. The problem with MOST children now is that everyone is afraid to spank their children BECAUSE they think their children will be taken away. I dont believe in spanking as an only means of punishment however it is occasionally necessary and if someone does not like the way i rear my child I really do not care. It is not abuse. The butt of a child is mostly fat and not alot of damage can really be caused by open handed spanking.|`|f90b4tgEaa	no i don't think it is, if the spanking is not too hard and for a good reason.  i was hit as a child if i was bad and it never did me any harm. in fact, it deterred me from behaving badly A LOT of times. if i did something wrong, all my mum had to do was raise her hand a little and i knew i was in serious trouble and i certainly didn't do the bad things again!  even though it is illegal here now i will still hit my child if they are being really bad as i don't think it is a coincidence that children's respect for their parents and other peers has gone out of the window since physical discipline has been stopped.|`|01422986073bb1352f22e7c8ebaaaeacaa	Most child development experts will tell you that any spanking is considered child abuse. Just like anyone hitting an adult is considered an assault. Besides, spanking children is teaching them that it's ok to hit. And then they often turn around and hit other children copying the behavior. Some states outlaw spanking. Others say if a swat or hit leaves any mark, then it is child abuse.   You can watch experts talk about the effects of child in a Saber Hacer video at www.SaberHacer.com in the Parenting Channel.
EULVtVDvaa	I just gave birth to my 2nd at the age 42 - I had a smooth pregnancy without any complications .I was active all through my pregnancy - exercised up until the end and did not gain a ton of weight . I was VERY blessed to have such a great pregnancy but I'm in great physical health .  The economy is scary whether you are 42 or 22 having a child . .|`|azrKKNfTaa	if your heart says yes then yes is the right thing to do. she will be a high risk pregnancy just because of her age but that doesn't meant that there  is anything wrong. and as for the economy yea it is probably not the best time to have kids right now. but if everyone waited for the right time there would be no one having babies.  so i say congrats on your possible new addition|`|wl7tlYOYaa	A pregnancy at her age can be high risk but is not impossible. She'll have to be monitored more closely by doctors and go through a few tests, but before u start freaking out why dont u tell her to get a test and see if she is pregnant or not? It can be risky but if she takes the right precautions she will be okay. Good luck.
hVVALFAPaa	Not knowing your weight, I went to a medical website for childrens' height predictions and entered your information. It is predicting that you will be 5ft 7in.     You may want to go there and enter all of the info, but remember, the average American woman today is 5ft 4in so you are already there!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I take it you mean you're 14 years old?  You could still grow, but i know by that age i was done growing.  It all depends on if you've hit puberty yet.|`|eeGN977eaa	Consider yourself lucky that you are 5'4" already. I am 27 and am only 5' tall. I don't mind though. In fact, I learned to love it because most people find it charming. It is much easier to be feminine when you are petite. I wouldn't obsess about something in which you can't control.|`|FAv1RYe6aa	Honey, you are not short, especially for a 14 year old. You are still growing. Believe it or not, you just might paa up your brother, it has happened in my case with my boys.  I remember when my boys were teens, they were 2 years apart and very competitive. My  2 son was 4" taller then the oldest for a while, Now they are all grown and the oldest is 6" taller. so no worries, you are growing normal.|`|Vy7AbWg7aa	donot worry u r growing u will get there when time comes there is nothin wrong if u r short.
p07RwZK2aa	I think four is a little young. If there was a problem and your little boy needed help then he would be alone.   I have a three year old son, who will be four in March, and I can't see him going into the restroom by himself anytime soon.     I suppose it depends on the place a bit - if it was a posh place then I would be more relaxed but in a grotty or crowded place I would stick with him.     I think around the age of 6 or 7 I would let him go alone.|`|yNbGq4viaa	I am a single mother and my son will be 6 in February.  Under no circumstances do I allow him to go into the men's restroom alone.  I have read and heard way too many stories of small children being fondled or even assaulted by men in the restrooms.  He will continue to go into the ladies room with me until he is able to understand the dangers in the world today and that not all adults are good people.  As far as the embarrassment factor goes, I'd rather my son be safe and embarrassed than suffer the consequences of my not being there to protect him from predators that are unfortunately in our society.|`|eeGN977eaa	I am with you. I think that is too young still. I understand that it is a difficult situation because he probably feels uncomfortable in the women's room but I would prefer a few minutes of being uncomfortable over something unthinkable happening in the men's room. I started letting my boy use it by himself when he was 6 and even then I stood at the door so I could hear if he yelled.     I would talk to her about it but try to do it in a way that won't put her on the defense.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	My daughter is 5 and her dad, and my husband would still bring her to the mens bathroom, mainly because, she would panic, if she locked herself in a stall and they were outside waiting, and she would mess about with the water and stuff if, they weren't in there with her.|`|105d8bb6a943a812def853bcae69c438aa	Why dont you talk to her about using the family bathrooms. The walmart we have here has a family bathroom. It's just a huge bathroom that a whole family can go to.  If that doesnt work why doesnt she take him to the womens bathroom and let him go to a stall by him self.  That doesnt sound safe|`|jNgh3e3Faa	I take my 6 year old with me unless his brother goes with him or it is empty and I am waiting outside the door. (he has two...an 8 year old and a 13 year old.)  It depends on his comfort level and how many people are in there.   My son knows to yell and if he is not out within two minutes, I come in. And I do.  :)  My son likes to wash his hands really good.  It depends on all of this.   There are so many bad people everywhere.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	7 or 8, at that age you can ALMOST hope they won`t horse around and understand that they need to do their business, and get out pronto..My 9 year old is totally aware that he`s in the women`s washroom, and he won`t go.|`|2HXq1569aa	For me, I started about 4 or 5 for my son as well but not every time. If family bathrooms were available that would always be my first choice. My second choice and third choices depended on the situation. 2 - I would still bring him with me into the ladies. There is no harm in it especially since the girls all do their business inside of a stall. 3 - But, he wanted to be a big boy so I started to let him go by himself.     At first, only when there was very little traffic going in and out of the men's bathroom. Then we graduated to almost anywhere and it would just depend on if I was in a hurry or not. When the kid is with you in the same bathroom it's easier to keep them moving.     When I did let him go by himself, I would stand right outside the door and keep a close eye on anyone coming or going. If it seemed like he was taking too long I would either ask someone going in if they could say "Tyler, you mom says to hurry" or if noone one was around I would crack the door enough just to yell inside myself. Ok, so, maybe I was a little crazy but we are talking about my oldest child.    I don't think it's too young but if you are uncomfortable then talk to her and ask her to wait until he is 5. At that point, I think it's time for them to at least start to go in on their own. By 6, they should be going in on their own most of the time at least and at 7 all of the time. That's just my opinion.     But, only you and your wife know if your son is ready (whether you are or not). I know I wasn't ready but my son was. So, I found a solution where it helped me to feel better about it and not worry so much.    Most of the time, there is nothing to worry about but it is scary especially when you just start letting them to go by themselves.    Good luck!|`|PcQuOmWqaa	Yes, you need to be worried. Why would she let a 4 yr. old go into the mens room alone?  With all the crazy people out here today.  Please tell her not to do that anymore.  Take him in the Ladies room with her, he is still little and who cares what other people think.  You are definetely not way off on this one.  I have a 10 year old son and when my husband is not around I will go home before he will go into a public restroom that has more than one stall before I send him in there alone.|`|js5zxWCqaa	NO WAY.  I don't even let my 7 year old go into a public restroom alone, he has to be accompanied or we go and find a family restroom so I can be there but there's no way in heck i'd send my 4 year old into a public restroom alone unless it was a single toilet bathroom with a lock.  There is too many pervs out there and I love my son too much to take that chance.  I think when he matures a little more and really cares about his surroundings and realizes the dangers that are out there, then I can feel safe with him going in there on his own but not until I see more maturity out of him.|`|FAv1RYe6aa	My boys when they were young went into the bathroom alone around 6 years of age. I am a very paranoid mom. Most parents think the worst. I never let them leave me to use the restroom, I always walked with them and waited outside the door.|`|7uVlYPEIaa	My son is 6 and depending on where we are I will either take him into the family restroom or let him go alone. Most Wal-marts now have a family restroom. I will allow him in there alone if I have the girls with us. It is too much a hassle to take them off of the cart and into the restroom just for him to go tinkle if the family restroom is open. I have also peered into the men's restroom. If it is clear I will let him go in alone. Heck I will walk in there even if a guy is in there I don't care, my job is to protect my son, not care if he is uncomfortable with a woman seeing his winkie. 4 is a bit young, My son is too the point where it embarrasses him to go in with me. So if I am in a good neighborhood I just let him go, keeping track of the amount of time he uses, and if we are someplace of question I do my check or go to the family restroom.|`|8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	I would think 5-6 would be a good age to start allowing that in certain places. If it's a place you go to regularly. If it's a new place then keep them with you. I would think that by 7 they would be fully capable of going on their own with you ex-wife outside waiting. 4 seems a bit young to be doing this unless the child is very mature and not afraid to be going in alone.|`|jN3pRKkEaa	I am a woman (single mom at the time) and I also started letting my son at 4 or 5 years old but then my dad told me that is a really bad idea.  He said men are sick and the last thing I want is some sicko doing something to my son.  My dad said that he has seen some real wierdos in men's washrooms before.  I had no idea, so I never let him again.  He is now 8 years old and I started letting him now because I feel he is old enough to tell me if anything wierd happens and knows what is OK and not OK behavior by adults.  Maybe you could explain it to her like that (if you also believe the kind of stuff my dad told me).|`|yreFf59uaa	Yes they would get so embarrassed to go in the wrong bathroom|`|FqRb2drmaa	For Boys - 5 years. For Girls 4- years. But it should be custom to where you are at, say you are at a place such as Learning express or a toy store you might let him go when he is 4, but at walmart or other large chain stores you should try to find a family restroom or wait until he is atleast 5 or 6.|`|hlq3Eo0haa	do u know how many pervs lurk in restrooms just waiting for the opportunity to strike.imagine putting a little one at risk cause your x is to lazy to take him. hope you going for full custody soon
oXzHvsBpaa	Dr Browns by far. I love them so much and swear by them now. They are great for colic and gas also. They are BPA free and come in plastic and glass. Its the only bottle that my son will use after going through 2 different kinds. First the drop ins and the Avent.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	That's what we used.  : )    My son went through nipple confusion when I went back to work and I wish I found these bottles sooner.  We LOVED them!!!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i used playtex drop-ins bottles- the liners are BPA free|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	We use Born Free, my daughter likes them.  When we were initially buying bottles last year MAM didn't make BPA free or else I would have bought them instead.|`|UV5htpg3aa	we tried every bottle made...we started with the Avent ... then tried Dr. Brown's and even tried the drop in liners...after purchasing all of them we went back to the Avent...|`|Lgo6UX12aa	Playtex drop ins are fantastic! It was great for preventing nipple confusion!|`|nZMcVFUzaa	Im an organic mom and things just like this issue i have researched and made sure to make the best decision pertaining to my child.   Dr. Browns Glass bottles are the Absolute best you can get..  Dont be intimidated by the glass, it is sturdy, just never allow your child to use the bottle unsupervised. Plastic is a horrible material to use for any baby food product.. when heated even in low temp.. you are infusing chemicals into your childs food/drink.. also non stick pans contribute to this factor.. just a few extra tips for you.
60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Ignore it  Distract  Redirect  Avoid letting them get overly tired or hungry|`|l4mMBe5Aaa	Glad to see I'm not the only one with an 11 month old who has a bad temper!  (She's quite the drama queen - she has a habit of throwing herself on the floor, burying her face in her hands and fake crying!).  We either ignore it or turn her attention to something else.  It seems to be working, as her tantrums are less frequent (if she kept this up, I'd hate to see what the terrible 2's look like!).|`|6VbNJOtfaa	My son is also 11 months.  He has quite the temper, as well.  I try to ignore him, or give him something to do (as the first answer illustrates).  This does not always work, and if he cannot be nice, I will put him in his playpen and let him play quietly by himself.  He forgets he is angry quickly and can join the family within a few minutes.    Good luck- I feel your pain! =)|`|xc8bnpCvaa	Prove to them that YOU ARE THE BOSS AKA ALPHA DOG! Do not let a temper tantrum go unpunished unless you want to deal with them the rest of your life.   1. remove the child from the thing/situation that is causing the tantrum (ie quiet time/time out BUT AWAY from you and everyone) and enforce it (11 months/no more than 2-3 minutes unless tantrum continues)  2. set and enforce rules/boundaries (do it now, waiting is bad)  3. spankings, if behavior continues, pop the hand/butt and tell them why in short easy to understand words.|`|7e0e7ff256c190317c5cec259f29a8f3aa	I agree with Amy F's answer! Couldn't of said it better!|`|WmXOfXqhaa	I agree that you should either ignore the tantrum or distract the child.  My son just turned 11 months days ago.  I haven't seen too many tantrums yet, but when he does get upset he seems to be easily distracted.    Amy F - seriously?  Spanking an 11 month old?  I don't agree with spanking at all for the most part, but for an 11 month old especially it seems harsh.
1kZenfZzaa	Your boss is an idiot.    Identical means the same, tell him to look at a dictionary.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Identical means identical.  If they have different genders I don't see how they can be identical.  If they are dividing from the same egg, then you would have an identical set of genetic material in each half.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	nope- not possible they are not idednticle if they have didfferent sex chromosomes- how can you call something identicle when it's COMPLETLEY different|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes identical twins have to be the same sex.  They are obviously not identical if one has a penis and the other a vagina!|`|3a0c551af182343c97509a84971a0d28aa	You already received some pretty good sources and answers, so I won't bother, but I have to say, your boss is a little misinformed. Hopefully, you'll have the ammo to stop him from spreading false information.    CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Impossible.  Identical twins are exactly that:  IDENTICAL.  They are both either male or both  female, not one of each.  Fraternal twins can be one male and one female.  Your boss is an idiot.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	The DNA in girls is different than in boys. The sperm carries the X or Y chromosome and that's what determines gender. In the case of identical twins, the cells separate from one embryo into two and because of that, they have the same DNA. If one was a boy and the other was a girl, the genetics would have been messed up and both would probably come out as hermaphrodites.|`|AA10529334	No they cannot be male and female for then they would not be identical you see.|`|N6vEZVNEaa	YES YOU ARE RIGHT IDENTICAL TWINS MUST BE THE SAME SEX|`|m0DgqEcjaa	Identical twins are always same sex|`|eU5Eth2aaa	Generally, the answer is no. Identical (monozygotic) twins are always same gender because they form from a single zygote that contains either male (XY) or female (XX) sex chromosomes. However, there have been a few reported cases of a genetic mutation in male twins where one twin loses an Y chromosome and develops as a female. The female twin would be afflicted with Turner Syndrome, characterized by short stature and lack of ovarian development. This situation is extremely rare, 99% of the time, identical twins are always the same sex.|`|N1IqgXfvaa	NO!! if one had a tail and the other didn't then they wouldn't be identical would they!!|`|mf2aSyB8aa	For twins to be identical they have to be the same sex. Heres a link to wikipedia    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin    hope i helped :)|`|AQBi862Jaa	You can have a boy and a girl twin but they will not be identical, however. I know this because I have a cousin who had boy and girl twins. It can happen. But they will not always look a like as you say...identical. In fact, some twins dont always look a like, therefore are not identical...even if they are the same sex.|`|azrKKNfTaa	identical twins are an amoeba separation and because of that they cannot be different sexes. only fraternal twins can be different sexes|`|n1vKoto7aa	No, it is impossible for identical twins to be male and female. Identical twins come from one egg (which can only be male OR female) that splits. I know this to be true, but give me a minute while I google some (credible) sources you can use....    EDIT: http://www.multipletreasures.com/facts-a...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin    http://www.pregnancy-info.net/monoamniot...    http://www.mahalo.com/Identical_Twins    http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-ide...|`|3VLvEeRUaa	Of COURSE not. That's retarded. How can they be identical if they're not the same sex?    http://www.keepkidshealthy.com/twins/exp...|`|dfBjPB1laa	Identical twins mean they are identical... "exactly" the same.  One egg splits into two, creating two of the same baby, well not the same baby, but two babies that look exactly like each other.  I've never seen a boy and girl look exactly like each other.  Male/female twins are non identical, called fraternal twins.|`|IYnxKUH7aa	yes ur right lol......u shud b the boss now     http://multiples.about.com/od/funfacts/a...    to prove tha point|`|hamdnq5Yaa	I have never seen or heard of anyone haveing identical twins that were a boy and a girl.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	Identical twins are ALWAYS the same sex.  Fraternal twins can be boy/girl.|`|TpEGKOFNaa	I hope he knows that Identical twins must be the same gender.     Why? Because identical means exactly alike-boys and girls, are they alike? No there is many very *distinct* differences between the two. Identical twins are exactly alike, same gender, same hair color, ect.     I Hope I Helped You! :D|`|CfCv8kjwaa	why yes you can...|`|dbafItLvaa	Yep he's insane.
lyNgNpRgaa	Go adopt.|`|Q87djE0laa	it can take up to 6 months to a year to concieve but if nothing happens after a year of trying you should both go doctors or go now just to find out if you do have problems so you wont think you are pregnant all the time just tell you doc you've been trying for a year hes not gonna know is he|`|WvUP7eJFaa	Two weeks is not long. It is not even long enough to pass a preg. test! Some people have tried for years before getting preg. You are not married to your BF ( I don't think people need to marry for kids) It is not fun to raise a child alone and can be very hard so think about this before you get preg. It changes your life totally and his very little. The baby will consume ALL your money and you will barley have time to shower so think about it and keep a baby for a week or two and see if you still want one.|`|YIy3WqWgaa	If you feel that you are ready to have a child, married or not, I would suggest studying up a little on the "birds and the bees".  If you understand how your cycle works, how you get pregnant, etc, then you should be able to conceive.  Just having sex for 2 wks straight will not get your pregnant.  You have to have sex around the time of ovulation to get pregnant AND it won't show up on a pregnancy test the next day.  Even if you get pregnant during a cycle, it takes 2 weeks or more to show up on a pregnancy test.      You seem a bit naive to the process of reproduction, I hope you aren't naive about what is involved in raising a child.  Best of luck!
s4LWmcTjaa	Oh yes!  All of the above (even sledding) require a helmet.    Head injuries can happen anytime during those activities.  I'd rather be safe than sorry.  My husband got a nasty gash on his head while sledding, lol.  Go figure, huh?    Of all things when I was 17 I got a concussion at church camp from an obstacle course!  The tire tower is not a good idea.....  The students who were supposed to catch me if I fell did not.  I fell straight onto my head and was knocked out.  What a fun way to spend your last year at youth church camp!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Yes, I do.    My boys have not yet gone skiing, ice skating, used a pogo stick, or gone sledding but when they do, they will wear a helmet.  I even have my oldest wear it when he rides his Power Wheel vehicles, for habit more than anything.  He got a new Packer helmet for Christmas from grandma and grandpa and loves it so he has no objections (so far!).      My mom is a RN in surgical ICU and I've heard one too many horror stories.|`|ybt605Qfaa	I only have my children wear helmets while breathing. That **** is dangerous.|`|EQ46eupcaa	I used to used helmets on bike riding until i got good.   But I wear a halmet while roller blading and ice skating.   Biking no b/c when you get good, u learn u can use your feet when you loose balance to keep from falling, wheras w/ ice and roller blading, your feet are the problem when you fall.   Using a pogo stick is half and half.   Sledding and skiing yes if you like to crash or just happen to crash alot.|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	Bike riding - because where we live, it's the law.  We don't ski (yet) and I'm not sure whether I would insist or not.  Rollerblading - they use their bike helmets for this.  Ice Skating - only when they are playing hockey.  Pogo Stick - we don't have one.  Sledding -  no.    I know there is always a risk of injury but they also need to be able to have fun. Sometimes the equipment just gets in the way and causes frustration and then they don't want to try at all.  They could fall down the stairs but I don't make them wear a helmet around the house.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	they used to, but then grew out of it.  My 8 1/2 year old daughter doesn't like too, but then my 6 1/2 year old loves too.  I let them decide.  My 6 1/2 yr old does when she is rollerblading.      Not for skiing or ice skating    They do a lot of horseback riding & don't wear one for that either.  Sometimes I think it's even more dangerous on a horse than it is on any of the other things.  Even in the rodeos the little girls don't wear them.    The horse is higher up & can run faster & step on them too, but they don't wear them.  Go figure!|`|GwXJpZWKaa	no|`|IaK4SRHpaa	I have to say yes to all of them except maybe ice skating.  I'm probably too overprotective but I say why take a chance on something happening.  Using any of those items could lead to a potentially dangerous head accident.  Even sledding and rollerblading could lead the head injuries when you don't expect it.|`|55db1dbbab55471fd7e483514f53d0a4aa	Hi!  Yes for all of the above except sledding. Although, if they were on a rough terrain while sledding then I would make them. My kids hate it but when they go to do one of those things I rarely have to ask them to get their helmets. I usually make them wear sport gloves or a thin glove too....just don't want a bloody road rash and the kids understand that.  Have a great day!|`|sxecXFgraa	Not really.  The only time they wear a helmet is when we go camping and some state parks have rules that kids under 13 have to wear helmets while riding bikes, rollerblading or skateboarding.|`|VU4DLpnlaa	my child doesn't do any of those, shes only a baby. but when i was sk8ing and blading i never wore an helmet unless i was practising rolls then i used the weight of my helmet to help spin my body, good job as well, i always fell when i did them lol.|`|8552a4e84a403e597110d3e39aa0659eaa	I have my son wear a helmet when he is on his bike, scooter or skateboard because in these situations ge is almost always around moving vehicles/parking lots. I require it also when he is in a rink because of the idiots that think no one except themselves belong there.|`|dDVAUA9saa	My daughter is only 22 months but will most definitely be wearing a helmet when the time comes for all of the above activities.  It is not worth the risk.      I saw a poster at a cycling shop once that had a picture of a small child wearing running shoes and a cycling helmet.  The caption read "This child has $100 feet and a $10 head".  My husband and I are cyclists and we both wear good, expensive helmets and so will my daughter.|`|5D0KuT74aa	yes  its the law here  except most kids now, have no idea what a pogo stick is  its sad, really|`|4YJPYqzXaa	Not sledding. But yes to all others.|`|NxNrZksXaa	i've only used a helmet once, with my barbie rollerblades when i was little (lol), but that was only because it came with my rollerblades set. after that i never wore a helpmet or knee/elbow pads with anything else.|`|MMdWfD1baa	I have my kid wear a helmet while she's: bike riding, skiing, and rollerblading.  Sometimes for skateboarding, never for sleeding, never for ice skating, and she really doesn't need one for a pogo stick.|`|443abc47eeff617e8dfb6b03a1b5dc30aa	Only for bike riding and rollerblading/skateboarding.  I don't really know why i don't make them wear them in these other activities.  I guess my parents only made me wear them when bike riding and skating when i was a kid.|`|BWQ8EMzEaa	--bike riding  - YES  -- skiing - YES  -- rollerblading or skateboarding - YES  -- ice skating - NO  -- using a pogo stick - YES   -- sledding - NO|`|FAv1RYe6aa	I would make them wear their helmets. there is a good chance of head injury, I do know way back when, no body used helmets, of course there were head injuries, broken noses, broken teeth, etc.  My thought on this also, way back you can leave an IOU with the doctor,pay later kinda thing. Not now, you pay as you go. So every precaution to avoid hospital trips is a good thing.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	yes to all but using a pogo stick. My kids havent ever tried one. Even sledding my children wear their snowmobile helmets. I have never enforced it as a rule or even asked them to. They know outside fun means helmets required.|`|ddzmEVYFaa	Yes.  Helmets are required in my household.  I wear a helmet myself when doing any of those things, although I personally do not ice skate or pogo stick.    When I was a child, two of my schoolmates were killed while riding their bikes.  One of them may have survived if she had been wearing  helmet, the other would likely have died in any case, as he suffered sever internal injuries.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Brody's so young still, but its interesting, I was never told to wear a helmet for anything when I was a kid.  I will be teaching Brody that he needs to though.|`|bi5lZYZlaa	i have 9 and 10 year olds.  they don't wear helmets for bikes, roller/skate boarding, pogo or sledding even tho' they have helmets. they didn't wear them while learning, either.    we don't ski or ice skate.     i encourage helmet use, but don't demand it.  you can't hover over them day and night; at some point you have to trust some of their judgements and instincts. you have to monitor what they are doing but give some space. so, i don't get too overly protective.  i don't worry over the head injury risk because i trust their judgement not to do anything really stupid since they were taught how watch for traffic and that stupid actions may create accidents.    i think it is hyper paranoia on those parents' part due to the isolated accident they may hear of.  most kids have common sense and their activities are quite normal, not the stuff of potential accidents.|`|547Ln6rNaa	We didn't have safety equipment when we were kids, so as a kid we of course didn't wear it.....but with my own son, I keep thinking 'what if something happened and you could have prevented it?' so he wears it for any activity, like skateboarding and bike riding and roller blading - of course he is only six and he's pretty rubbish at most of these activities so it's wise to pad and protect him, I don't think I have actually let go of him when he's standing on the skateboard yet, he just randomly falls off even when it's not moving, lol, but I want him to have a go and he is very happy telling other people he goes skateboarding, (even though we usually sit on it and go down the hill together, more like sledging!)|`|YqoxcTN9aa	yes, & i do believe the risks for your child are alot less when they wear a helmet|`|AA10730513	Bike - Yes.     Roller Skating - No but she only does it in a rink that has a rubbery floor. She will wear a helmet when she starts skating on harder surfaces.     Scooter - Usually, but not when she is riding on the grass. (scooter that's like a skateboard with handlebars - she doesn't ride anything with a motor yet.)    We don't do ice skating, pogo stick, or sledding. I don't know if I would make  her wear a helmet for those or not ... Guess it would depend on surrounding obstacles.     I personally don't like to wear a helmet for anything. It makes me feel enclosed which makes it harder for me to pay attention to my surroundings. I will wear one to set a good example for my daughter, but when she isn't there - the helmet comes off. Hopefully if I make her get use to one at an early age - she won't get the same "trapped" feeling that I do.|`|80Zlwifsaa	My children are basically trained when it comes to helmets. I don't even have to ask them to put one on before they ride their bikes, or scooters, or skateboards. Even a pogo stick- those things are kind of unpredictable.    My sister is a firefighter/EMT and she has seen some pretty sad results of lazy parents not putting helmets on their kids when riding bikes, etc.|`|cteyFJxhaa	bike riding - it's law here.  skiing - no  skateboarding - no  ice skating - until about 6 yrs old then just when playing hockey  pogo - never had one  sledding - no    I think that sometimes over protecting children makes them reckless.  Like that fool who thinks he can do 120 kms in a snow storm because he's got snow tires.|`|irLnPW4aaa	My kids definitely wear helmets when bike riding.  The few times my child has been rollerskating, skiing and ice skating she has also worn one.  She has never used a pogo stick.  When sledding we don't use one, but realistically we should.      In my state , I believe that there is law stating that children under 12 MUST legally wear a helmet while bike riding.|`|AE0nK4Q3aa	well, when first learning, yes to the first three. once the kids get really good, I dont' think it's too neccisary, but a good idea. no on a pogo stick, that's a little over kill. sledding is debatable. not a helmet for sure, but make sure it's in a sort of open field slope to prevent crashing into trees.|`|VIuvOJoxaa	well, abviously im not a father, but i am a kid too old for a helmet now but i did have to wear one for my bike and rollerblades. thats about it. :)|`|6oy6tQGjaa	umm...i not a parent but i do all of the things you listed and i dont wear a helmet while doing any of them. iv neverr gotten hurt either nd i nv fell. so i guess nope|`|Emc2XOJWaa	Well my daughter isn't old enough for any of those alone, but I went sledding with her recently and I did have her wear a helmet.   There's just so much ice and there could be rocks under the snow.  I mean I was sitting on the sled with her, holding her, but if anything were to happen and she fell off I wanted to be absolutely sure she would be okay.  :)|`|ZfcDh4jqaa	parents are babying their kids way to much these days, when we were growing up we didn't wear helmets to do these things and we turned out just fine.  If the kid gets a little hurt, they will learn from their mistake and become stronger and smarter b/c of it.  if you try to protect your kids from every dangerous thing in this world, they are going to grow up to be complete *******.  Let the kids have fun if they get scraped up that is all part of being a kid.|`|38fe66cc26fd24d41aff94bf6ba97574aa	My daughter usually wears a helmet while she is riding her bike.  I make her do this as she is still learning.  Luckily, she is only 5 and is cool with wearing it.  If and when it gets to a point where she does not want to wear it, I will probably still make her do it.  I don't know what I would do with myself if something happened and having a helmet on would have helped.    Also, when my husband was young he fell at an ice skating rink and ended up with a concussion.  So in that case having a helmet on might have prevented that.

XPnCeJ29aa	GOOD LUCKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Can you PRETTY PLEASE update us!!!  Seriously!  Lol  As silly as it sounds I feel like I know so many of you, I mean Ive been on Yahoo for how long and Ive watched preganant ppl have their babies, one babies turn to  2 on board, babies learn new things, parents learn new things..  Ive been thinking of you and you little boys today, so keep us posted!|`|547Ln6rNaa	Hey good luck, no matter what they say it's still the same kid.     I know we felt weird when we saw 'brain damage' written on his medical record for the first time, though we knew his dyspraxia and hearing loss was caused by his traumatic birth, we always said "he has dyspraxia and a hearing loss in his left ear" - you see? it's the same thing, but how we looked at it made it seem different. Just keep looking at it in a positive light!      Goodness knows in little D's case our "worse case senario" could have involved us sitting here six years later WITHOUT a child with dyspraxia and hearing loss.|`|jVhWIDRnaa	Prayers for you!!|`|RGx530AUaa	Don't be afraid. Whatever the evaluation outcome is, it will work out for your child and your family. All children have special needs in one way or another and if your child's challenges in life include being on the autism spectrum, he or she will still be a totally unique and interesting person with all the potential for a happy life that all children have.     I was in church recently and the priest said that the Bible mentions not being afraid 365 times. One for every day of the year. It's a nice thought.|`|zQAWuMN4aa	I wish you the best of luck. Please let us know what happens.    They will be asking you a bunch of questions. At the daycare I used to work at a couple of the teachers in the 2 yr old room had a questionairre to fill out on things this child did and didn't do. Then it was submitted to the doctor I believe and from there he was diagnosed.   EDIT:  What's with all the thumbs down, people? Gimmie a break. Nobody deserves them.  Let us know!|`|YqoxcTN9aa	best of luck for you & your grandchild!!!!|`|uj1A73ZGaa	Good luck and we will keep you guys in our thoughts and prayers.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Good luck Jamie!!!  : )|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Good luck and my prayers are with you.

I'll be thinkin of ya!|`|0VJE7BXmaa	I just read that they may be linking premies with autism, which in my opinion is good news.  I think that is a sign that it is all about a delay in brain development, and this generation of autistic children may simply be delayed (possibly catch up with extra help and catch up by the time they reach teens and adulthood.) Keep this in mind.|`|AA10811784	Good luck to you and your precious little boy! Stay positive, everything will work out just fine.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Good Luck!!!! Everything is going to be fine :)|`|DD5CMWfkaa	Good luck!     If your 4 year old does have Autism, just keep in mind that it is not the end of the world, and there are plenty of things that can help them function as a normal person in society. It takes patience, love and understanding :-)|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	Good luck...I hope everything goes well.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	All the best!|`|2Hot9EJiaa	I will not only wish you luck I will pray for you and your family, and wisdom for the doctor.|`|vKYdV5r2aa	GOOD LUCK !!!!

I hope everything is ok!!
OrKpKxkHaa	I believe they will do the procedure without the insurance and bill you. The medicaid should cover up to 90 days prior once it is in order. They cannot deny your baby basic medical procedures. I would go to the hospital and see if they have some kind of charity case program. If they dont, I would call like 5 on your side or whatever is in your local area with the news and make it public that they are leave a 3 week old baby's life at risk. In any case, I'd beg, borrow and steal. Write them a bad check. Whatever it takes. Good luck!|`|EeGgovyCaa	Go to the DSHS office, they maybe able to assist you|`|U5RObaBGaa	is there no way you can borrow the money, i'm not sure how it works there as i am in the uk so we have nhs, i can't believe they would leave a 3 week old baby with out having something done just because of insurance reasons there has to be a way round this|`|awRNr2VMaa	look on google for charity hospitals around you. everywhere has one i think. i live in louisiana and we have two. if not go to another hospital. what is the reason for the ultrasound? if you know the reason take him to the ER of another one and tell them whats going on and he needs it done! if they refuse you then go to another hospital and so on.|`|ZIdhNsxPaa	Go to a WIC office and apply for MEDICARE. Skip the regular department of human services. Not medicaid, that's for prescriptions. That may have been your problem.    Also call different hospitals, some create payment plans and others will actually ask you to fill out a medicare form at the ER. And there is always county hospitals. They aren't the best, but its an option.    Don't let money issues stop you from getting your child health care. Especially if its serious. Go into debt if you need to, its just a hospital, they won't take your car or home for owing them.|`|mbGOEZSAaa	Maybe you could talk to a church.|`|vh7J9fFtaa	Talk to your Dr. right now tell him you want the paper work for emergency medicade.If that don't work go in for the test and tell them your medicade is in prosses they should do the test for you.Then they will send you the bill and you take that to madicade that should work.
omegLbOAaa	Noah Gaetano|`|F44b2np9aa	Noah James  Noah William  Noah Isaac    I would choose another traditional name - probably with 2 syllables but others would work! Have fun!|`|UF1obD42aa	How's about Bennet?|`|08d8e4d52f5338ea25059bf9c2474615aa	Noah Bartsalots.|`|vOD4Urzdaa	Noah Donald  Noah Keith  Noah Oliver|`|vvAyfBGCaa	My school did this too, it sucks!     How about Noah Michael, Noah Andrew, Noah Mason?    Oh, and fun trick for when it gets fussy at night: when you have to "rock" the baby to sleep, put a board or something on the floor (has to be something hard and flat). Put the baby in the carrier and tie a scarf or string to the handle of the carrier. While the baby is fussy, pull the string to "rock" the baby from your bed.
IUnrYCx9aa	I'm experiencing something similar right now. I had a mc in early Nov, had one period since and now it's been gone for about 7 weeks!  I felt period-ish around the right time, but nothing.  I guess I don't have any solid advice, just that I'm as confused as you are!    There's always the old stress excuse (but don't you hate hearing that when ttc?)  All you can really do is wait it out and see what happens. Test again in a week or two and if there's still no AF, call your doctor.|`|hVVALFAPaa	You could be pregnant. The spotting could have been implantation bleeding, when the fertilized egg actually attached itself inside your uterus.     Take a pregnancy test.    P.S. not sure what AF and -hpt mean.
OrKpKxkHaa	Zoe is cute Christina is common. Noah and Joel are kinda common too. Are you guys into traditional names? Because Lyric isnt lol. There are a million names out there to suggest but you didn't really give a theme or an idea of what you are into. My daughters names are Jocelyn Marie and Liliana Faith. I wanted I wanted Talia Faith or Talia Paige. For a boy he wouldve been Antonio.....the third lol. Other names I liked while pregnant were Marley, Penelope, Avery, Annaliese, Evangeline/a, Valentina, Dominique, Priscilla, Miley,Valerie, Arielle/a, Charys, Chyler and Sadie. For boys I have Aubrey, Avery and Reese. Good luck!|`|gdnL63ngaa	Actually I really like BOTH those names!!!  They sound very nice|`|InZU5aaxaa	I like Noah Joel but for some reason Zoe Christina doesn't flow as smoothly. Try a shorter middle name. Like a two syllable middle name.    I don't have any suggestions because I am trying to come up with my own baby names. Hope this helps.    Good luck and congrats.|`|2GAmYReHaa	Deep-six that Zoe and Noah stuff.  I can guarantee you that all the Jasons and Brittanys will pound the hell out of any kid with a dumb name like either of those.      Here's the hot set-up, pork chop: if it's a boy, name him Lyric Joe and if it's a girl name her Lyric Sue.  That way the kid's name will fit better on a wanted poster when he or she grows up.    You're welcome.|`|C0GeEv7kaa	I really like the name Zoe but I don't like the combo with Christina. I love the name Noah but once again I don't like it paired with Joel. I just had my daughter on Jan 24th and we named her Marley Paige. Marley in remembrance of Bob Marley and what he stood for. Good luck on your pregnancy!|`|yAG3PFcsaa	I quite like Christina and Joel. I've always liked the name Cameron for a boy, I also like Ty for a girl....not sure what you think of them...you prob hate them lol|`|72SrLDQ3aa	I like them both.  For suggestions...    Noah Patrick  Aiden Charles  Peyton Jacob    Natalie Elizabeth  Riley Savannah  Brinlee Paige
NSHZUQyOaa	hey i see ur baby still not coming, me either! got a sweep booked for the 3rd will be 41+1 then. hope things move quicker for you|`|giEXhSTIaa	Congragulations and good luck. :)    x|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Congratulations it wont be much longer.

gL6h7CCGaa	Ok so if you have had sex before then you need to take a pregnancy test.|`|wQSsw8QHaa	i dont know how old you are but it could be growing pains are you sure you have been carful every time cause you could be pregnant|`|AA10590038	I get those every month about a week before I start.|`|acaddddd976fea5ce3ef78b4ac51f1e3aa	Your going to die in seven days, or your horribly pregnant. Sucks for you.
SaRDq9iLaa	That happened to my daughter a lot too. I bought the next size diaper, so that way the poop wouldn't go so far up the back.  I also put a less expensive short sleeve onesie under her outfit so it had less of a chance ruining her cute outfits.  If the poop did get on her outfits, I washed them out with soap and water then I sprayed "Greased Lightening" (it is actually a product used to get stains out- I buy it at Shop-Rite) on the clothes and wash them.  The spray has always worked for me whether it is poop stains, food stains or any other stains.  Good Luck!!|`|ABWQgoDtaa	buy her a body suit diaper|`|qYbFMRcUaa	rubber pants. they sell them by the cloth diapers.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	Have you tried Pampers?  Huggies seems to run a little small, in my opinion.  Also, I can't think of the brand, but Babies R Us sells diaper covers.  You could look into something like that.  It would probably be a pain to wash them all the time but I imagine much better than constantly ruining her clothes.|`|hVVALFAPaa	This is the best clue that it is time to buy bigger diapers.|`|P25GuvNjaa	Try to change it as soon as she has done it!  I found huggies were the best as well and if you stick to white vests and baby grows you can bleach them when they get stained rather than have to bin them!|`|ddP3klT3aa	I would definitely get her a bigger size. And when she is having a BM lay her down. Don't let her bounce or any thing. Make sure the diaper is on right..tight enough around the waist, but not too tight. Sounds like the diapers are too small. The only time my son ever went outside his diaper was when he was active and having a BM at the same time. Sounds like an operator fail to me. ha ha. We just use parent's choice diapers. Cheap ones are just as good. They work better for us then huggies. They aren't as soft so they seem to absorb stuff better.|`|m7crO0phaa	Huggies are the best. We tried different brands too. You can try to tighten the top(make sure you don't cut her circulation) .    It has nothing to do with the wetness.    One thing, try the huggies stopleak or snug and dry if you haven't yet( not sure how big your baby is)    I know how bad it gets, we have gone through it quite a few times, it is worst when you are out shopping !|`|ncpl2ruzaa	How old is she? Maybe the diaper is to small. My son use to do this as well and then i would always goa  size up and he was fine. Maybe she has diarrhea? With more runny poops its hard to keep it in the diaper, every once in a while my son will have a leaky mess like the ones you describe. If shes old enough maybe change some foods tha she eats that can be causing the more runny like poops.|`|AA11606085	Time for bigger diapers, momma!|`|6cfb6cd3197d1e471020aecf96fc5902aa	Id say to make sure she is in the right size diaper and than to try the rubber pants, should help create a buffer zone between poopville and pretty little girl clothers.|`|vzDmaWqaaa	Usually the poop out of the diaper because either the diapers are a little bit too small or because the diaper is not changed frequently enough.  watch for grunting or red face and change the diaper as soon as they stop.  Try a bigger size in a huggies diaper.  they have good heavy straps you can sinch down to make it fit better.  If they dont work now they will in a month or so so it wont hurt to buy them.  good luck this is a yucky situation.|`|faPKwClPaa	This may seem overly simple, but does she maybe just need a bigger diaper?  Our son was having 'incidents' such as that becuase he was, literally, getting too big for his britches.|`|XOtHsTo0aa	Time for bigger diapers.  I bet that will solved your problem.|`|m3oA5xLYaa	try the next size up in diapers|`|GfphOIdOaa	You sure you're using the right seize? Maybe buy a larger seize.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	How old is she? And what size of diaper?  Sometimes a babies weight is not the best indication of size of diaper  My son would have leaking problems if I moved him up a size before he was ready even though his weight was over the weight recommendation on the size of diapers. She might need a smaller or larger diaper, or you may need to tighten or loosen it.
Kr09aQJkaa	I get the same crap sometimes. Here are some of my responses:     My husband and I are a team. Not playing the same position or against each other.   My husband is a real man and supports our family financially. He doesn't need a paycheck from me.   When you have to work and your child has an important event who do you tell no? Your boss or your kids? How do you give 100% to both?    I love being a mother and I don't feel I can do a good job mothering on evenings and weekends only.   Raising kids with morals is very important to our family. I asked the daycare worker if she thought raising kids with morals was important to her and she said, "I get off at 5:00." I guess it's not in her job description.   I'm breastfeeding for my baby's health and well being. My breasts have to be with the baby in order to nurse. Otherwise I'm just a milk cow.    How well does a household run with two housewives? What makes you think two careers would be any different?   Wow! You must have a great life. Work, pick up kids, make dinner, throw in a load of laundry, feed kids, help with homework, give kids bath, put them to bed, drop dead from exhaustion and start all over the next day. Your lucky not to have play time with the kids, sex with your husband and time for yourself to clutter up your day.|`|jfKvI4wLaa	Oh usually I just stay home all the time so I never talk to anyone else.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	I very, very, very rarely have anyone criticizing my life.  I honestly can't think of one time that I've had a rude or negative comment directed at me simply because I'm a stay-at-home mom (although I'm sure I just invited some troll to send me an email.  lol).  I know that some people on this site like to 'voice' their negative opinions about a SAHM, but that's just their opinion and I don't let it get to me.    As for post-partum depression, I suggest talking to a doctor about it.  Where exactly are you hearing all of these negative and rude opinions?  If you are referring to people on this site, then the simplest solution to that problem is to turn the stupid computer off.  If you are referring to people in public, how do they even know that you are a SAHM unless you tell them?  Why let a bunch of strangers get to you like that?  If its family giving you a hard time, then just simply stop speaking to them until they can be more supportive.    It doesn't matter what your reasons for being a SAHM are.  Its your business, not theirs.  Learn to just tune people out.  Have faith in yourself and your decisions.  What you think of yourself is more important than what everyone else thinks.    **Wow.  Who are you hanging around?!  I'm also a military wife and I've never in my life heard anyone speak to me or any other SAHM the way that people are speaking to you.  Are these friends saying this?  People your husband works with?  Neighbors?  Family members?  Complete strangers on the street?  I just can't fathom someone walking up to you and saying these things.|`|1kZenfZzaa	I always stayed home with my kids.  If anyone says anything to you, just smile and walk away.  You know you are doing the right thing so to heck with them.  Always feel good about yourself and what you are doing.  I was always thrilled that I was raising my kids instead of a babysitter.    Keep your chin up, you have nothing to feel bad about.|`|OgQOVsxPaa	My mother is a single mother, and she is a lawyer, so I go to private school, and she goes to work, so I can't answer your question, but I think stay at hime mothers are lazy who rely on their husband's income only, unless they have some sort of medical reason meaning they can't work, or if they work from hime :)|`|OfHoaWf7aa	If you hate society, you're off to a bad start. What will you be teaching your children? I'm a single, stay at home mom and I own my business. I'm loving it! Who cares what other people say? They'll always have things to say, even if you work outside the home. Then, you'll have questions like : "Don't you miss your kids?", "Wouldn't you want to be with them and see their milestones?" Try to remain positive and be a good role model for your kids; you must lead by example. If you encounter a rude question or comment, just smile and say "Why do say/ask this?" If you're confident in what you're doing, they'll leave you alone. Good luck!|`|6EnQYZEOaa	First I commend you it is not easy I was a stay at home mom can't afford it  or I would . My sister has been a stay at home mom for the past 10 years she is very active with the school and volunteers alot when they where little she did play dates and trips the local movie theater on thurs. mourning's has free movies for mom and tot. Ignore them some people can be rude If I could afford it I would stay home to also try support groups for parents with kids who have aspergers my eldest nephew has it to.|`|qGQCLFinaa	LOL! I was going to say something similar to the first answer ;p  I do that often, just cause i can.  Honestly, i really don't get any criticism for being a stay at home mother, in fact a few moms i know, that aren't are envious of my situation, I am so happy to be able to do this for my son & our next children,  It may get tiresome, overwhelming, frustrating, days of pure HELL,  But i go take a timeout for myself, regain my composer, & go back at it.    Kids are very hard to handle at times, my son is ornery, stubborn, energetic & talkative.    If he gets bored, he's getting into trouble.  He's always been that way, even as a baby he gave me a run for my money once in a while!! You just have to hang on & enjoy the best parts of the ride, and learn how to deal with the bad.  The better you handle yourself the better your kids will behave, I realize so often that my mood & my energy is reflecting onto him.  I get stressed out and have had moments I felt maybe i should just run away & never look back.  But i love my kiddo too much, I wouldn't even get past the front door!!  I have made a few friends in my area (FINALLY! it took me years!) but they are also Stay at home moms, so it's nice to get together & chat with them, we're all going through the same motions, it's so nice to hear that i'm not the only one out there going through the things i go through!!  But it has helped me tremendously having friends I can trust! Even just talking on the phone, or an e-mail is so nice to get! We can't always get together as much as we'd like but it is relaxing when we do :)  Don't listen to what ANYONE says!! I've had so much judgement passed on me, for being an "unwed young mother"  It hurt, but at the same time, this is my life, & my choices, I didn't want to marry someone just because we had a baby together, i wanted to make sure the man I marry is someone i know, trust & will 100% be there for me until the end.  I've found that man.  But now we're waiting for $$!!  I'm not a huge fan of society either, everyone judes on how you look, if you're too fat, your hair isn't perfect, your skin etc.  It's ridiculous!!  So you have to just ignore the comments you can't stand & accept the ones that make you feel good, you know if your heart, who you are & what you believe, if you are a good person or not.  That's all that matters, You & the ones around you that care.  My favorite quote "the only ones i need in my life, are the ones that need me in theirs"|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	Mothers who work get criticized for not spending time with their kids.   Mothers who stay at home get criticized for being lazy non working-contributing to the home.    Can't win either way. Another words, you have to ignore any negativity and do what is best for your life style you are in.     I am going to be a stay at home mom for the first few years of my child's life. My husband is in the military, and even though it doesn't pay well, I rather spend my time in the most crucial development years with my child than trying to get money instead of living within our means.     I would say to them "sorry, that is your opinion to work and not spend time with your kids. I am not just a mother, but I am also a teacher. I also have my college education, I have my hobbies that I do outside the home and my house is taken care of. Focus on your life decisions, not mine".|`|zcZGRPc2aa	well i am a sahm also but nobody has ever said anything to me about their opinions on it. As for J hannibelle, we do not sit around all day and watch television. As a matter of fact, like most other moms, are always busy, doing dishes,laundry,cleaning, cooking, cleaning, cleaning cleaning. And beleive me it isn't as easy as alot of people think. I would rather be a SAHM than anything, I worked for about 2 months before we had to move and never had time to play with my child. I wouldn't ever go back to work unless it was needed because being with my child all day means everything to me. It's the most rewarding job ever. So J before you go calling SAHMS fat asses and lazy why don't you be a SAHM yourself and see how hard it actually is.|`|OThwE3Whaa	What could there be to criticize?  You are obviously an industrious, busy SAHM who is chatting on Y answers.......|`|38fe66cc26fd24d41aff94bf6ba97574aa	I recently started working part time.  Before that I stayed at home even before I had my daughter.  I really truly do not care what other people think.  Even if they say something tacky, I might get a bit angry, but then I realize that the only reason they are like that is that they have something wrong with them and that is their coping mechanism.  So then I feel bad for them.  Does not mean you have to let anyone run over you, just don't let it get to you.    I do think being on your own all day and having more than one child would make it harder.  I hope that your husband understands what you are going through.  Mine works from home, and so he has been there from day one every day and he gets it.      I know Asperger's does make it even worse.  I am assuming that you go to church.  Does your church have a Mother's Day out?  If not that, check your local library to see it they have a story time.  Also, the next pretty day, go to the nearest park or playground and hang out.  That is a good way to meet your neighbors and other Moms or Dads who are in the same boat as you.    Hang in there!  It will get better!|`|0VJE7BXmaa	I don't understand at all.  Why would anyone criticize you for staying home with your baby?  I can understand someone criticizing someone for putting their child in daycare, but why would anyone criticize you for being a stay at home mom.  Could you please give some more details?  Of course the best thing for a mother to do is to stay home with their baby, especially if they have special needs.  I don't care what anyone says about me, I just let things roll off my back.  You have to toughen up a little bit.    I don't know who you are hanging around, or what kind of discussions you are having to provoke such a response, but I blame those answers on a combination of two things.  One- Jealousy, people wish they could stay home with their children.  Second- Ignorance, people actually think daycare is good for children, when it is near child neglect  (i've worked in daycares the nice expensive center ones, and believe me, its all an illusion, children receive very little attention, how could they? Look at the ratios 1 teacher for every 4 infants, 1:5 toddlers, 1:7 preschoolers, etc.  a child belongs at home with mommy if at all possible!).|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	I'm not a SAHM but I know a lot of woman can be jealous that you have the opportunity to be with your kids all day. Others don't really realize all that SAHMs do (well some...).     I just watched the movie 'In the land of women' and it deals with Meg Ryan's stress of being a SAHM. I think it really describes how overwhelming it too can be.     As for unwanted comments... ignore them, they don't know what you do and their comments are just impersonal, uneducated opinions.    As for any depression, do at least one thing a week just for you. Take care of you so you can take care of others.... even if you have to just do it in small steps.    I hope all of this passes soon!|`|vue9NOhYaa	While I'm not a SaH now, I was one for the first 3 years of my child's life.  And I never got a negative comment.  Most mothers, I think are envious of other mothers who are able to stay home with their children. (I know that if I COULD still be at home, I WOULD be.)     The only 'response' that is necessary to rude comments is none at all, or, if you must say something "This is what works for our family."    EDIT:  Sounds like you need to find less obnoxious 'friends.'  And are your friends NOT aware that the economy is in the toilet, and even if  you WANTED a job, it's not just a matter of going out and getting one?|`|AA10390690	I'm a young stay at home mom. I haven't went to college or had a job yet and I get criticized ALL the time. Wanna know what I do?? I ignore them! I know it's easier said than done but I know my focus and heart is taking care of my daughter, nothing else. I have decided when I feel stable enough I will attempt to go to college && possibly find a job but my heart and soul is raising my daughter. It is hard and I agree people can be cold-hearted but unfortunately a lot of parent's don't get to stay home like they use to back in the day so people forget how life USE to be, in my opinion. Hang in there and if you need any one to talk to, msg me =]|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I stayed at home for 7 months before starting a day nanny job that I take Jacob to. before that I only did afternoons. just run errands and get out...even if just to window shop. Honestly..if I didn't have to work I totally wouldn't!    And really... all those comments you got..they are jealous.  Work is put too high up on the priority list these days. If you must then fine.. if you don't have to then why would you unless you wnated to? You know what mothers and fathers are bad examples? The ones who take all the walfare they can and don't do anything else to help themselves.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I think people who criticize stay at home moms do so because of all the negative images regarding women, stemming from antifeminist groups and people who think that women who choose to stay home to raise a family are setting women back to a time when women had no options for furthering her career while raising kids, choosing to have less than 3 children so that women were seen as more than just birthing machines, and be completely independent from men-with dependence being the biggest problem. Women who choose to stay at home to raise children are almost completely reliant on their male counterparts to support their lifestyles, and I think this is what a lot of other women have problems with. I doubt very seriously that it has anything to do with a woman's decision to dedicate herself and her life to ensuring that her children had the best foundation for learning possible. Most people, men and women both, feel that home is where a child's learning should start. My husband is a SAHD and it works out great for us. He has even less to do than a lot of women because a lot of women we've come across think that my husband stays home because he had or can get no job. It never occurs to people that we chose to live to this way. So, there is no support group for him and he doesn't have a the benefit of a circle of friends like most moms I know. I'd say ignore them. That's what I do. Well, I don't really because I always have a smart-mouthed comment to give but ignore them is what I should do. So should you.     Personally, I have no problem with women who choose to stay home to raise a family. However, I don't believe women are or should be complete domestics so I'm only in favor of stay at home moms. Once the children are old enough to go to school, I feel that a woman should be working to be self sufficient in contributing to the financial upkeep of the house and she should not be spending her days cooking and cleaning. If there are no children in the house, she CERTAINLY shouldn't. The whole house should be cleaning and cooking should be divided between the two adults, if both parents are in the home. It's housewifes that I have a problem with not stay at home mothers. I applaud them. I'm sure I'm not the only woman who feels this way. So believe it, there are quite a few woman who aren't so traditional- like me- and still applaud you for choosing a traditional stance.|`|1MgpiqfJaa	criticizing what..good old fashion values?? I have done both and found that going to work is a relief of stress|`|s30Duwdraa	I wouldn't worry too much about what others are saying. People are going to give their 2 cents worth whether we like it or not.  Being a stay-at-home mom, is harder work than any other paying job out there. There is no start time or end time, it is a constant task!  Kudos to you!    I chose to work after my baby turned 1 and people talk.  My hubby is a stay at home dad, and you wouldn't believe the slack he gets.      You can't win, no matter what you do.  It really does suck.    The only thing i can suggest is to enjoy your family and worry about them and their well-being.  Ignore the idiots that have nothing to say and find people that support you, because the rest aren't worth it.    Remember, opinions are like ***holes, EVERYONE's got one!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	listen this is how i deal with it and this is the best piece of advice I can think of...... when someone irritates me with their 'opinions' i simply remember that opinions are like a**holes everyone has got one and they ALL stink!|`|TBNaPkl6aa	Have you considered joining a moms' group in your community (something like preschool PTA)?  I found a stay-at-home moms group in my area through meetup.com too.  You might find that helpful.  That way, you'll have other moms in a similar situation to talk to.    I know it's hard to ignore people's comments, especially when you have PPD to deal with, but honestly, I think people who dare criticize a SAHM are simply jealous of us.  Staying home to raise kids isn't an easy job, but we're lucky that we can do it, given this economy and all.  I have heard a lot of moms who work outside the home say they'd love to stay home with their kids.  I also think moms who work outside the home get some flack from people for their decision to be employed, so perhaps they're bitter and trying to take it out on you (I don't know who's criticizing you though)?      Try to keep your chin up, and if anyone dares make a comment about how you choose to raise your children and your choice to stay home with them, I'd say you have every right to give that person(s) a piece of your mind.  I wish society could accept the fact that every mom is amazing, and every mom does the best she can.    ETA: Cupcake, if you think being a stay-at-home mom is easy, shadow one for a day.  Seriously.  Thanks a lot for calling us lazy.  I'm a SAHM who happens to be getting her Ph.D. right now.  I certainly am not lazy.|`|VU4DLpnlaa	i'm a teen stay at home mum (i recently started college 3 days a week). i don't care what people say about stay at home mums cos i know that i'd rather know my child's fave colour (lilac) fave show(in the night garden) fave song (walla walla bing bang) and my kids fave person (uncle harry, my lil bro) then work all the time and not know that. my mum was a working mum and she knows nothing about me. once my daughters in school full time i'll work school hours, but how many working mums can tell me all their 20 m/o child's fave things? the only thing that really bothers me are people who judge me for being a teen mum, mainly cos i know most are like how they think i am. they do sit around and do nothing.|`|RGx530AUaa	There will always be people that are better at telling you how to live your life than they are at living their own.     You are the only one that has to live with your choices, so don't give them the satisfaction of getting you upset. No one has to defend themselves on a daily basis.     If someone is being rude about you staying at home, just smile and politely say, "Thanks for your concern, but I'm doing great! How are you doing?"     Postpartum depression will pass, but if you are having an especially difficult time, talk to your doctor. He or she may want to prescribe something for you.     If you are feeling bored, there are several things you can do: Start a new hobby (cooking, making jewelry, karate, whatever interests you), you can do lots of reading (Fannie Flagg is a great author and so is Maeve Binchy), call friends on the phone or go visiting, join on-line chat groups, look for a Gymboree Play & Music center nearby to take your baby to. Bookstores and libraries also have frequent reading groups for kids, take your child to the mall and just walk around for awhile. You could try selling on ebay, or Avon or having Pampered Chef parties if you want to meet people and make some extra money. YMCA's are also great places for fun programs to do on your own or with your child. I met lots of friendly moms at the park near my house. IF you want some help organizing your house flylady.com is GREAT! It is also a very supportive community in general.    Do not feel guilty about your choices or if you are sometimes frustrated with being with a baby all day -- we have all felt like that sometimes. It is normal. Take naps if you feel like it. Make sure you make some time for you to do what you like and make sure you get some grown-up time too. See friends, go on dates with your partner, get out of the house without your child sometimes, it will make you a better mother and a happier person.    Hang in there, everything will get better and easier. You are not alone! Good luck sweetie.    I just read your examples of what some people are saying to you, wow! I would respond with this, "You know, if your mom had stayed home with you, you might of learned better manners."  You can then end the sentence with something like "a--munch", "loser", or "idiot"  if you are feeling especially cranky.|`|AA12221392	Please understand that their are good peolpe out there.     I understand what you are going through, my son is being diagnosed with this as well along with many other things, I actually lost my son he is in a treatment faculity because he did something to harm someone and I had to call the law on him.    It is hard to raise normal children but when you throw in the mix of a challenged child then we have even more on our plates. There are many people out there that are going to judge you no matter what you do.  Just know that every one has just that a opionion and dont know your life to judge, just keep being a good person and doing all you can do for your children and let them think whatever
jaP0TANdaa	I still haven't found the answer for this one... but the same thing happened to me for the last two cycles. I'm usually 4-5 days during my period with at least 3-4 of moderate flow. Last few cycles I was lucky to get one full day of "regular" flow and a day and a half or so of spotting. Some say that abnormally light bleeding could mean that you are pregnant... but, that wasn't the case for me. Others say that this (if it continues for more than three cycles) can indicate a problem with your uterine lining not building up enough due to a hormone imbalance or other problem. Then, others say this is nothing to worry about. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.|`|n6OemdySaa	It could be implantion bleeding,   I normally have a 5-6 day period and this month I have no cramps whats so ever and My "period" only lasted like 3 or 4 days and I only needed like 1 tampon a day ---tmi sorry, but of course going to the bathroom like 20 x a day i used WAY MORE!! :)  I hope this is it!. :)|`|FJSHCc8maa	When you eat a lot of hot food because it make the blood run faster out of your body.

I hope that's the case for you, too!|`|Jhkoz18Xaa	A regular, but light and short, period is called hypomenorrhea.   Hormone pills, IUDs with hormones, or birth control pills could normally make your periods light or could normally make them go away altogether too.  Being pregnant can also make your period lighter.   Hypomenorrhea, a light but regular menstrual period in and of itself is unlikely to be a problem as long as you are ovulating regularly.  read more below ......
jaP0TANdaa	The best and most accurate way to do it would be to start charting (using BBT, OPK's and cervical mucus) to help you better understand your body, your cycles, and your body's clues that you're ovulating. If you aren't quite ready to start that, the only other way I can think of is: take your shortest cycle (which for you is 24 days) and divide it in half, then give yourself a few days in case you ovulated early... so let's say CD10. Then take your longest cycle (which for you is 31 days) and do the same... so CD14. So, I'd say your fertile window would be somewhere between CD10 and CD18 (adding a few days in case you ovulate later). But really, to get a better idea for all of this charting is your best bet. Good luck to you!|`|ZF7S7EUPaa	use ur caleder probaly 2 weeks i dont know|`|Jhkoz18Xaa	The first thing you need to do is to calculate the average cycle days.

It could be different every month every body is different.  you need to learn yours to help you achieve your goals.    I never though i would chart but i am glad I did.  It helped me tell the doctors they were wrong.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Your average cycle is 27 days so you should ovulate anywhere between 12 and 18 days. The easiest way to detect ovulation is to get an OPK. You can also learn to track CM, BBT but with the OPK there is no real guessing, it tells you when it's going to happen and when it is happening. Good luck!
iwYu32N2aa	Well I experienced the same thing. I had bacterial vaginios and a yeast infection. When ever I had sex it would hurt so bad, and I would hurt the worst when I went to the bathroom after sex.Then i got some meds from my doc that I had to take for 7 days and I also got a cream for the yeast infection and now it doesn't hurt. Hope this helped.|`|IllWKAUGaa	I would call your doctor, it might not be completely gone, in which case it needs to be taken care of...there's no harm in calling...|`|EDwlTWLwaa	talk to your doctor|`|AA10953561	I recently went through the same thing. I thought it was just normal with pregnancy that sex would eventually become uncomfortable. Then it got to the point where we hadn't had sex for a couple weeks and I still had that tight/swollen feeling down there. I also noticed a funky smell. I talked to my doctor about it last Friday and he said it sounded like bacterial vaginosis (similar to a yeast infection). He put me on some antibiotics and they started clearing up the discomfort right away. We had sex yesterday for the first time in like three weeks and it was good (not painful at all!). So I would talk to your doctor again and see if it could be what I had.    Until abstain from sex. Good luck!|`|YTOrDW3haa	simple, dont have sex.

Dove I've thought is a cute name, and wonder why it's not used.  Indigo is a cool name, though I'd probably use it for a middle and not first.  Same with Blue -- I think it makes a cool middle name.|`|T7uFoSUQaa	These are the only one's i would even consider    Girl:  Shiloh  Calista  Sailor  Coco    Boy:  Tiger|`|TAufQoc7aa	No Nay Never|`|YcLImmyraa	The names that I'd use are:    India  Juno  Rhea  Ellis    I like quite a lot of them, but I think some are a bit too wacky to actually use.|`|XZxNQSlVaa	yes some of them I like and would consider.    Actually I almost named my son Atticus (his name is Oliver)    I don't see anything wrong with Shiloh, Jena (tho I don't care for it), Novalee I really like, CoCo would need to be a nickname, I've known a girl named Brett, I've known a girl named Genesis I thought it was pretty, also known a girl named Dove and thought it was pretty, and I think Juno is cute.    Oh yes and I quite like Rhea.    I like Blue and Indigo but not sure I would name my own child that....I like Tiger but then again I kind of want to name my next son Bear...    I wouldn't do Tyson because it makes me think of the chicken    Lots of those masculine sounding girl's names might be good if paired with a feminine middle name...for instance I knew a girl named Perry Ann and I thought it was cute...|`|UVhCCgcHaa	Yes, some of them!!

AA10730513	I'm going to guess overprotective mom and a fear of the past repeating itself. She doesn't want you getting involved with another guy who ends up hurting you. Plus she doesn't want anything taking from the attention her grandson will need from his mom.    But I have seen you say many times that you plan on taking things slow. And I don't see anything wrong with that. ... There's nothing wrong with a trip to McDonalds. Although the movie will be kinda loud - but I guess Jamie has your tummy to protect his little ear drums from loud noises.     My family had a hard time with the idea of me being in a relationship after Cheyenne's dad didn't work out too. I hate to say it - but I think that seeing you mess up big with 1 guy makes them think you aren't good at picking your own men. ... Which is totally wrong, but it took me like 2 years for my family to even consider the possibility that I might be capable of picking my own man! And now that I have, I think my mom has expected (or wanted) to hear wedding bells with the last two guys I dated. (One of which I have lived with for almost a year now.)    If this guy is a good guy, just tell your mom that you appreciate her caring, but this guy is special to you and you want his support / company too. You know Jamie comes first. But your friend makes you happy. .... In time, she should see that you are right.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	she def. sounds like shes being a little over protective....whether you decide to have a relationship or not...your aloud and need to have friends and support outside of your family and home...or youll go crazy!!.....id break it down for her...your an adult and there is nothing wrong with being friends or even starting a relationship with this guy...she should be happy for you,that your not alone and someone wants to be with you and your baby.....its hard to find a guy these days with wants a women with baggage,per say..... she just needs to get over it....|`|UCwnchlhaa	She saw u going thru a rough time after being hurt by your by ur babys father...so shes simply trying 2 protect u from being hurt again!  i think thats really sweet of her but i think that u should talk 2 her and tell her how u really feel=)  hope ive helped  xxx|`|6EnQYZEOaa	well it could be one of two things 1- afraid you would neglect your newborn and don't need to focus on him right now but what is going on in your life now or 2- doesn't want you or her grandchild to get hurt I will be honest I personally being in the position your in right now would not even think of trying to start a new relationship not for a while newborns can be especially demanding and you need time to get over the ex.|`|aJjV5b95aa	She is worries about you, the baby and your feelings. remember she has already seen you not treated well by your baby's father and does not want it to happen again. Also with the baby coming in a few weeks you have a lot on your plate and she does not want you to be stressed anymore than you have to be. She is just be a mom and a grandmother. You have to see where she is coming from too.

The fear is that she will not give her all to her child, but to the relationship. Or that the child will suffer because of a new relationship.    Mom does have a valid reason to be concerned. Those pregnancy hormones will stil be kicking around and going haywire until a couple months after baby is born. That and caring for a newborn is a full-time 24/7 job,  she may think you'll get overwhelmed seeing someone new and learning to be mommy.     You said yourself, you aren't jumping into a relationship but taking it slow. Mom will adjust better once she sees you aren't rushing things.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I think she's just trying to watch out for you, nothing more.  When Jamie gets here, you are going to be sooo busy, you have no idea.

There's nothing wrong with having a friend to hang out with everyonce in a while though.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	It does sound like it might be a little over-protectiveness, triggered by the fact that you are "going somewhere with him tomorrow night" (you don't specify what that entails -- if there's drinking and carousing going on, she's just looking out for the kid.)|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	She may be concerned for you and Jamie's well being.     I agree that now isn't the time to worry about a relationship but there's no reason you can't go out and have a little fun.     I think you just have to reassure her that you know right now is about you and your son, but you know that when you do have Jamie you'll be really busy, so you might as well spend some time with friends when you can, it will help pass time.... this waiting game is boring and you'll need a distraction!
wzXJOSIeaa	I worked until the 17 and I had my baby on the 20th. I do believe it is a good thing to continue working because it keeps you on your feet and as long as you are on your feet the pains aren't as bad. It also gives you something to occupy your time and keep your mind off of the pain. Once you just stay home in bed you will just get worse. And the pain you are having in your leg is from the baby pushing on your syatic nerve it's completely normal. Stay on your feet, drink lots of water, and eat healthy. Best of luck.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	It's the truth. The only thing you can do is take vacation or sick time if you have it. I was finally put on leave at 38wks because I had the flu and couldn't get rid of it. My water broke the next day so I never did get to rest before the birth. It's hard. What I found helpful was to take a day of vacation each week so I could just work 4 days a week, I found Wednesday to be most useful to give me a mid week rest. If you have vacation time you can also cut down your work day a bit.|`|VFUdAtrHaa	If you are hurting that bad that it a medical reason. and i would ask this doctor too not because of your pregnancy but because of how much pain you are in. They cannot ingnore it. If they do Seek another opinon. I plan on working intill im 39 weeks but thats only if my back and wrist can handle it. Im already going to phsyical therapy twice a weeks and im only 26 weeks lol     Good luck!
njLVIp55aa	It depends on your doctor and the hospital...most places only allow one person..that being the father, in the room but cant hurt to ask....    usually if you have to have a planned c-section they do it 1 week before your due date.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well in most hospitals only one person is allowed in the room during a c sectino and they would start planning a csection about two weeks before your due date and they would set the actual date for csection to be about a week before your due date|`|eDnWMm3maa	I'm quite sure they only allow one person to be in the room with you.|`|fPX1lD8uaa	I've never had a c-section before... but I know they allow the husbands in the room, but I don't think your mother will be allowed in there as well.  Only 1 person will be able to stay with you, then after the baby comes, that person leaves with the baby while they finish doing what they need to do with you.|`|p3NW0Mstaa	Depends on the hospital, but most now have Birthing rooms that become surgical rooms if needed.  And yes you can have them in the room with you if they allow, they put up gear over the area cutting on and block view anyhow..|`|FUeW2EMUaa	I'm in Ireland and i had an emergency section with my first baby, my husband was with me and after she came out he held her next to me until i was stitched up and then we went to recovery room where they put me on my side so i could cuddle her and feed her. I am due to have a 2nd section on Fri 13th Feb which is two weeks tomorrow and i'm pretty sure you can only have one person with you in the theatre. I will be 39 weeks exactly when i have it, hope this helps you good luck.|`|QufZeqlVaa	no it is only 1 person because their is doctor and nurses all around the room what they want is space nobody to be in the way/ i have had 2 c section. and father is allowed on room and hes welcomed to see eveything. but not recommended its better if he stands next to you not to see the whole cutting deal and pulling. good luck. if its your first time man very painful. im pregnant again 6 months this will be my 3rd child via c section
ggfE4rlvaa	Amoxicillin is based off of yeast. Almost every woman gets a yeast infection (or thrush w/e you want to call it, thrush is the form of yeast infection babies get i believe) and you're pregnant so your immune system is down. Get a 3-day cream or egg treatment, and good luck!     P.S get used to yeast infections..they happen alot in pregnancy!|`|v3LnJycKaa	any antibiotic can cause a yeast infection, they kill off both good and bad bacteria and can cause your body to over compensate especially when pregnant, dr recommends you use the 7 day cream as it is a lower dose of the meds, some will say you can use the 3 day, but i think if it is your first you should stick with the 7 day.|`|P25GuvNjaa	Yes, antibiotics can cause thrush, even just being pregnant can cause thrush!  You should get canesten cream from the pharmacist.|`|IllWKAUGaa	antibiotics wouldn't cause it, it would actually help it....yeast infections are very common in pregnancy...you should goto your doctor asap to get this taken care of...it wont go away on its own....and you can't be sure of what it is unless a doctor checks it out...|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Yes!   Thrush is a yeast infection, antibiotics are well known for causing them. Do not let it go away on its own. Since it's your first one, go to the Dr and get him to suggest something/prescribe something. Go as soon as possible. You don't have to wait for the antibiotics to be done.
NeTNnvSZaa	Because it's a hassle for them.  You have to advocate for your child constantly when they have a learning disability.  The school department will do what they can from having to incur the costs associated with testing.  You should contact your states board or education to see what services or testing she might be qualified to get.|`|qq804CE8aa	Probably because she goes to a private school and maybe the principle was not aware of public school testing, or forgot about it?  Contact your local school district and see if they can test children who are in private school.  Your doctor could recommend a good psychiatrist/doctor who does this sort of thing as well.  Good Luck!  Sounds like you are on top of the problem.     My kids went to private (Christian) schools and they were not really qualified to do this sort of testing.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	While I am a Christian AND, have learning disabilities resulting from needed brain surgeries, for the testing, if it were my child, I would ask the public school system for the test.    The principal should have been up front with you.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Given the standards and practices that are in place for these things, I doubt your principal "forgot." I do freelance work for a non-profit organization that is a learning disability advocate and get emails from parents whose kids are being refused services, where the school is reluctant to test, etc. I think what it boils down to is a) money and b) it requires them to do something special for your child that will force them to change their current practices. Not all schools are like this, but when I hear from these parents how reluctant the school is to test, you have to wonder why. It's like they don't want to deal with it because it's easier to push the child through and ignore the problem. I know this is a problem too, because my husband works with kids in HIGH SCHOOL who have profound reading difficulties - because their schools refused to address the problem and help them. It sounds like by referring you to the pediatrician, they want you to take responsibility for it, even though the school should be offering it if you feel it's needed. But it wouldn't hurt to get the peds okay first, and then tell them - "this is what my ped said and now let's test her at school."    UNless the principal and coach are trained, I would say thanks but not thanks and go through whatever local organization you can find that might be able to help you. i.e. Depending on what you think her disability is, perhaps you can find an advocate group who can help. Or  a tutor privately that might have connections or be able to turn you in the right direction.     Obviously, the sooner the problem is identified and corrected, the better. if you're hitting roadblocks with the school, be your child's best advocate and fight for the services you are entitled to.     Email me if you have any questions.|`|zi9knUCGaa	My son has a LD. He was tested by a member of the school board. Yes, public schools have access to all these tests and are required to administer them if there is a question about LD. The principal probably didn't  inform you of the resources because they are only available to public school students free of charge. You can confirm by asking the principal about it. Look up info on community psychological services for your city/county. They usually have programs that offer LD screening and testing either free or on a sliding scale. But first take the principal up on the offer to test. See how your daughter scores on the test first. You might not need to pursue it any further.|`|ePkiOzPSaa	Possibly because you said it was a private school, which is not the same.  If you are sending your kid to a private school, he might assume you have some distaste for the public school system.  It sounds like the principal was just offering you other possible options.|`|be64d009796329cb5ad90ed9c0da483caa	Once diagnosed with a learning diability it is the LAW to provide them with accomodations to help them complete testing and classwork.  Maybe the principal doesn't want to provide these.      LD students can also create a sub group for the school due to No Child Left Behind.  Maybe the principal doesn't want to have the sub group in the school.     I would FIGHT to get her tested.  It is the law that if a parent requests the school has to test.|`|pwfyXL5xaa	... It could have been that she had no knowledge of this service provided by the public system ....OR in the world we live you need to see both sides of the coin. Since its a private school having a student with special need as ADD or any type of learning disability may compromise the school in the way that by law the have to make any type of accommodations necessary for your daughter to continue her studies without her environment being changed drastically, since this could also affect her state of mind. There for she doesn't want this to go into public attention since it can be compromising for her. I still think you should make any tests available for your daughter and help her through any difficulties she might be having.|`|szVvf7Nkaa	It could that at your daughters school that they don't have the qualified professionals to do this test. The best test result you can get for your daughter is for you to see her pediatrician. Your pediatrician will send your child to the childrens hospital where they take more advanced tests and she will be tested by a qualified professional.|`|AA10168889	The principal may not be aware of these services.  The principal may be afraid that you'll take her out of the private school and put her in public school.|`|FAv1RYe6aa	They don't want to deal with the paper work, the principal at you daughters school is being lazy.  I do know that you can go to your pediatrician and he/she will give you 2 evaluation forms, one for you to fill out and one for your daughters teacher, NOT the principal. Your daughters teacher will fill it out on how she sees her and her performance in class. her principal would have no clue. You would do the same on how she is at home. I wouldn't deal with the principal, just her teacher.|`|etzhw4j7aa	he doesnt want his school to be known as having disabled kids in it ....what an @$$!|`|14pjwQPLaa	She is at a private Catholic school, right?  Usually, people enroll their children in private schools because they don't want to have anything to do with the public schools.  So why would the principal refer you, who have obviously eschewed the public school system, to a public school?     ALso, the public schools tend to over-diagnose learning disabilties because the more kids they have with "special needs", the more money they get from the federal government. Amazing how many kids have special needs, these days.     If your public school system is obligated to test your daughter, then by all means, have her tested.  Personally, though, I'd be looking for a private psychologist for the testing, anyway, but it's your choice.    Keep in mind that private schools do not fall under the same rules and regulations that public schools do.  "No Child Left Behind" does not apply to private schools, and neither do state laws regarding inclusion, etc. They are not required to keep kids who have learning disabilities that significantly interfere with their ability to learn -- they can simply say that "we are not properly staffed to handle LD and ED issues" and refuse your child admittance.  You cannot force a private school to make accomodations for your child. Or, you can look for a private schools that specializes in LD/ED issues -- but at that point, you are talking serious money.|`|JzYlcuXzaa	I would think it's because he might lose a student who pays to go to school.  I would definitely take her to a specialist and zoom in on what trouble she is having if any.  If she does have a learning disability, from my experience I would take her to a public school that has a program for students like these.  You will probably be pleasantly surprised as opposed to these Catholic Schools which usually don't have very good programs for this, if they even have a program at her current school.      Good luck to the both of you
R0RnjdnXaa	I don't really have morning sickness but milk sure does help a lot when I do get it. I make a ice cold milk shake almost every morning. I just add milk, strawberries, a banana some ice and a bit of sugar...yummy!|`|T9fek24eaa	I have a horrible time with milk not having morning sickness. I dont think I am brave enough to try that... all thought if I am going to get sick anyways I may give it a try. BUT I do have to say when I was pregnant with my daughter, the cliche of 7up and saltines for when you are sick to your stomach did not work for me, it made it worse. The things that did work were odd things like mt. dew and strawberry oatmeal. SO what I am getting at is it does not surprise me that milk may work :)|`|ZVvVWS80aa	Milk helps me as well with my morning sickness ;-)|`|z7fCaoXbaa	I didn't try it with morning sickness, but when I first started my prenatals they upset my stomach, and milk worked great with those!|`|Yl79igD7aa	Good for you that you found something that helps.  Thankfully, I didn't suffer too much with the morning sickness (just ever-present nausea) but I'm off milk since getting pregnant.  I used to try to drink at least one glass per day and now I can only tolerate it with cereal.  I used to buy a gallon and drink it all myself (my husband can only drink soy milk), now I'm down to a half gallon and I'm lucky if I don't end up pouring half of it down the drain.  Your bones will thank you!  :)|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Heck yes! It worked great for me. Milk coats your stomach sort of like a tums. Plus you get the added bonus of Calcium which is great for you and the baby. (Some people take tums only for the calcium not for indigestion)    My major downfall was dipping oreo's in the milk... I am sure that accounted for at least 10 of the extra pounds I gained during pregnancy. LOL!|`|QhVCn7rsaa	It's really good that you have found something that works for you.    Milk actually makes my sickness worse. Still haven't found anything to help it.    Good Luck with your pregnancy.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I haven't tried that yet, but I definitely will ASAP!  I'm 16 weeks pregnant and still have morning sickness all day and night.  I've tried everything I have heard and have had no luck, but as soon as my husband gets home I'm going to make him go buy me some milk!  Thanks for the suggestion.|`|fE5zMOfJaa	Every time I eat or drink something dairy I vomit!  So yeah....it makes my morning sickness worse too!|`|PwhrTNZraa	I have always found that milk always helped to soothe an upset stomach for me, chocolate milk especiallly.  It makes perfect sense to me that it's helping you and I'm happy to hear you found something that's taking the edge off!!  I think it helps to coat your tummy or something, at least that's how it seems to feel for me!!
szVvf7Nkaa	The ideal waist line for your height is 26.8. The ideal wait line 24 inch is for a 5'1. You might be able to model for that one time but your body is going to suffer for it. You won't be able to live if you only eat salads. And you won't be able to keep a modeling job because you are not a person meant to be with a 24-inch waist line. You are forcing yourself to have a 24-inch waist line but you won't be able to keep it up. If you were meant to have a 24-inch waist line then you wouldn't have to work for it. I think you should give this up. And go for something that is not going to ruin your health.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	1. Who is 'she'?  You never said who 'she' is.    2. A 24in. waist is borderline anorexic.|`|ySKK7lCyaa	talk to your mom and tell her how much this means to you. And make a deal that if she lets you do this that you will do chores around the house or maybe get a job to help pay for everything. It is expensive.|`|9zwSclnLaa	Brownie points.  Start doing stuff for her around the house.  Clean up without being asked, don't argue with her, etc.  Than sit down tonight and have a talk with her about how serious you are about modeling.  Tell her all you need to tell her about this.  Don't get angry or raise your voice.  Accept her final decision and don't throw a toddler tantrum if she says no [no matter how much you want to] because even if you don't like her decision, she has a reason for it.|`|zi9knUCGaa	Talk with your mom.

BfmV2KpUaa	Nothing to worry too much about health-wise. He needs to go to his bed earlier.   Does he by any chance stay up late in his room playing computer games ? It's a common problem. If you know for a fact he's getting the right amount of sleep (About 8 hours), and it's happening a lot, only  then would I consider taking him to the Doc for a check-up.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	It is called Narcolepsy. Read this link and get to a doctor.    Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that causes extreme sleepiness and may even make a person fall asleep suddenly and without warning. Specific causes of narcolepsy are not known but people with narcolepsy are lacking hypocretin, a brain chemical which regulates sleep and wakefulness.     The sleep attacks experienced by people with narcolepsy occur even after getting enough sleep at night, and make it difficult for people to live normal lives. Falling asleep during activities like walking, driving or working can have dangerous results.     Symptoms of narcolepsy include:    Intermittent, uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime   Excessive daytime sleepiness   Sudden, short-lived loss of muscle control during emotional situations (cataplexy)   Narcolepsy may be genetic, but it also appears to be influenced by environmental triggers. Treatment requires a combination of medication, behavioral treatments, and counseling.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Was he really asleep or did something happen on the bus that you don't know about?|`|AA11210405	Well, It's always possible that there is something going on.  He could have just been extremely tired but there could be medical reasons, too.  My son has a sleep apnea. He was diagnosed and now sleeps with a breathing machine. He used to be tired all the time and was very difficult to wake. He could fall aslepp almost instantly and also snored.    It never hurts to go to the octor and have him checked out. It's probably nothing|`|FAv1RYe6aa	He may have been just very exhausted. but do mention this to his doctor. Never just assume that he was just tired especially if he has never done this before.  I don't want to scare you, but sometimes so called "candy" are given to kids by another child and its not really candy. most of the time things don't go on in elementary like this, but I have heard it happening, I have always stressed to my children from day one, Never ever take anything that goes in your mouth from another student, even if you know that person.  Just ask him if any of his friends gave him something to eat like candy.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	no he probably just didn't sleep well the night before.the only reason you'd have to worry is if he fell and hit his hear and did that|`|AA12149303	Take him to the doctor. This could be a serious problem.|`|zGDZjCFVaa	Probley didn't sleep the night before, just be careful, if it happens again speak to his doctor about it.|`|4gzsWCigaa	You should def talk to your doctor about it. Its the only way youll find complete comfort|`|z49jtDTzaa	maybe he just didn't have enough sleep like when my parents try to wake me up in the morning it takes them about 15 mins...so maybe he was just so tired he fell asleep on the bus and went into a deep sleep and struggled to wake up...i don't think its a big problem. maybe just going to bed earlier? hope that helped|`|fee80ea1112f0f01af4280757ecf8929aa	he's probably just tired.|`|AA10645224	HE MAY HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED|`|FqRb2drmaa	Take him to a pediatrician ASAP
MeYILJeSaa	My baby's head isn't flat yet, but I had a cousin that had to wear a helmet to shape his head because it was so flat on the back. His was pretty severe though. I'm sure your baby's will round out with time. If his pediatrician isn't worrying about it, it is probably nothing to worry about.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	my baby is 3 months old and has a pretty flat head in the back . his doc told me it would round out but my sons dad has a flat head also so he just might take after him|`|awRNr2VMaa	my son never had a flat head but usually at 7 months if its not straightening itself out then it might not. i saw a baby in walmart a few weeks ago that was about a year and a half and his flat head was so bad he looked like an alien! poor kid. i would talk to the doc about it if its bad the baby will probably have to wear a helmet. flat head is caused by leaving the baby laying down too much or the carseat if left in long periods of time will do it. make sure you hold the baby alot if its not crawling so that his head isnt down too much.|`|YW72TLapaa	My son is 2 1/2 months and his head is pretty nice and round, he ha always slept with his head sideways, now he is starting to sleep on his back and his head straight but we turn it to one side then the next. We also got him a special pillow that wont let his head get flat.   My husband has kindda flat head but my mother in law says thats how his dad head was, idk if this is hereditary lol.  my daughters head is also nice and round never went flat in the back.
be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I used the one dollar test from dollar general this time. I got a positive 4 days before my period was due. The cheap ones are actually really accurate they just don't have all the fancy packaging and stuff that the more expensive ones have.    I have also had good luck with first response, I used that brand the first time I was pregnant. Got a positive 2 days before my period was due.|`|IllWKAUGaa	they're all the same, the only difference may be how sensitive they are....if it is an early result test then it is more sensitive (25 miu/ml compared to 50 miu/ml), just make sure it says that on the box...i would personally go with the dollar store ones, theyre cheaper and do the same thing...|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Read the side of the boxes when you go to get one and buy the one that will detect the lowest amount of hCG, the pregnancy hormone and buy that one. I personally used First Response, but have heard good things about EPT and dollar store brands. The only one I have heard bad things about is the digital kind because although they are easier to read, their ability to detect hCG is not as good as others. Good luck to you!|`|ddP3klT3aa	They are all 99.9% effective. Pretty sure any ways. Use whatever one you want.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	I used Clear Blue Digital.  You can get a 2 pack for $10 at Walmart.

No lines to interpret..|`|zsrnhstUaa	i took 3 walmart brand test,they all were negative.I knew i was pregnant so i took first response.And it was possitive.I wouldent buy the cheap test.I would buy a name brand.Im now 9 weeks!!|`|NiOjHyfKaa	DOLLAR STORE TEST WORKED FINE FOR ME...|`|BRBPDBvIaa	I've used all three and they're all the same.  I looked it up online to see which is better and it said that it doesn't matter which brag it is.|`|pR4nLjyRaa	Dollar tree test!  I got a positive 3 days before my period with one of these!  You can always back it up with another brand once you get your +!  :)|`|rXMSK2B6aa	I liked the clear blue digital because it gave you the results in words so there is no questioning it.    Good Luck!!|`|T9fek24eaa	First Response is the most sensitive. Depending on what kind of EPT test you are using (EPT certainty, the one with the + or - or the one with 2 lines) the dollar store test may be more sensitive than the EPT. A good site with all this info on it is www.peeonastick.com. I got a bfp  at 9 dpo with First Response Early Results.|`|YK8P5rNXaa	I think they all work the same its up to you on witch one you want.... Good luck!!!|`|rC6gL7KOaa	They all work the same as long as you're testing the day after your missed period. I had a $1 test and I tested 3 days before i missed my period and I got a positive.
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Well, first of all sign language is VERY good for children, and for your family it is also necessary to learn it.    You say in the city-do you mean New York City?  If that is the case, there should be no trouble finding a program.  First, though, just check out your local book store and/or library.  There are MANY books and videos available that would be beneficial to  your entire family.  Look for American Sign Language (some baby sign programs use signs that are not necessarily ASL-I was sure to teach mine ASL).    Next, check any places that hold infant and toddler based programs.  For instance, I know that where I live (in a much smaller setting than NYC) several of the Mommy & Me gymnastics or Kindermusic host sites also have classes/lessons for Baby Signing.  Your pediatrician's office might be another good starting point.    Call ENT or audiologists office and inquire about any programs they can point you toward.    See if there is a school for the Deaf and/or Blind.  They may offer community programs or be able to point you toward some.    If there are any Community Education programs (where I live, hosted by the Parks & Recreation and/or Continuing Education through the public school district) that would be another place to look.    I hope that helps!|`|HB38sMkfaa	ive been teaching my daughter and my self asl since she was 6 months old.shes 22 months now and we are still learning.i just went to the library and check out as many books as i could and started in with the signs.honestly i never used the internet for signs though im sure there are tons of great sites that show you exactly how to do the signs.  i also goto my local community center and the library weekly for the mommy and me groups that have sing and sign classes and toddler play groups. my daughter uses signs when she talks to other children and has even taight a couple kids signs like milk,play and mama! how fun!our childrens museum has the same thing ( but i have to pay to get inso its infrequent)    its really fun to use sign language and so easy to incorperate it into life.your son will love it!he will probably pick up on it really quickly too.  good luck

Keeping the walls plain or adding a border means you're not tied to it all the time and it won't look babyish as she gets older.  Try not to have anything on the wall above your changer as your baby will gradually learn to pull everything down.

NQ2sDQMRaa	shes probably fine, she seems like a great sleeper if before she was sleeping 7-8. its probably a growth spurt, my son slept a lot during them, even at 18 months, for a few months he was taking 6 hour naps after sleeping 12 hours a night. Dont worry, the routine is bound to change once a month or so, because as your baby gets older its needs become different, I say enjoy while it lasts :)|`|7SKVCPcSaa	nope. she'll wake when she is hungry. just rest with her and catch up on your sleep!!|`|qiyLq6CRaa	I WOULD BE SUPER HAPPY IF A 9WK OLD BABY SLEPT FOR 11 HOURS LET ALONE 7-8 YOU SHOULD BE A VERY HAPPY WELL RESTED MOM|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	That sometimes happens.  It is OK.  Growing is hard work and tiring and that is why a baby sleeps so much.|`|wTeJulT5aa	Don't worry if she does it sometimes.  My baby is the same way as yours.  It's nice she sleeps so long.  If she keep sleeping too long, and that's preventing her from eating enough throughout the day, then you should maybe wake her to eat.  As long as she's happy and gaining weight, then I don't think you should worry at all.  :)|`|rt4OnxkYaa	count you blessings!!! shes fine.. you're just lucky.. my son wouldnt sleepthat long at a time but he napped a lot..|`|vh7J9fFtaa	I have five children the first one would sleep 11 hours a night enjoy it now because it could all change.|`|awRNr2VMaa	as long as she doesnt lose weight from the not eating at night let her sleep. alot of babies (lucky moms and dads) sleep through the night from day one! my son woke up every 3 hours to eat until about 3 months then he slept through the night and then at 4 months he stopped and woke up once or twice a night then at 6 months back through the night and hes 9 months now and hes still sleeping through the night.|`|KGnpgBfVaa	if you are really that concerned, call your pediatrician. You pay good money to them, you should be able to call them and ask|`|mgLb5Yohaa	Wow...your baby girl is sleeping on average 7 hours a night...I'm seriously jealous!     Okay, the 11 hours, um, is she a napper? Did she push hard the day before and needed to catch up on her zzzz's? You know on average, a newborn will sleep 16-18 hours a day until after 3 months old, perhaps your baby girl gets hers all in at once!     It seems she takes in a chunk of hours of sleep at a time, anyway, and perhaps this was just an extended night. I would monitor her, check if she is running a fever, if she isn't feeding. If you're really alarmed, all your Pediatrician's office, and ask to speak to a triage nurse who can settle your fears immediately.    Wish you the best...you lucky thing, you!|`|EL3P7YA4aa	She is fine...lol we had the same thing with our 5 month old now but all she did was sleep...lol..she sleeps 11 hours now..but make sure she isn't loosing weight. and keep an eye on her...congradulations.|`|7d632fbyaa	THE MORE SHE SLEEP THE BETTER FOR HER.

kprKXEOSaa	Yes, your blood pressure being high could have just been a fluke that day.  I'm not sure what else would cause you to have protein in your urine, though, maybe dietary issues?  I had preeclampsia with my last pregnancy.  I followed the advice from this book, "Fertility, Cycles & Nutrition" by Marilyn Shannon.  In addition to my prenatal vitamin, I took 450 mg of B6 and 1000 mg of magnesium.  (She recommends at least 50 mg of B6 and 500 mg of magnesium for every pregnant woman, and you up the dose if you get preeclampsia.)  It brought my blood pressure down and allowed me to go full term.  Clear it with your doctor if you decide to try it, I'm not a doctor.|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	You do have a chance not to have it.  Wishing you the best of luck in that.  With my first son at about 34-36 weeks I started having high blood pressure and the protein in my urine.  I had to go in every single week for a urine test and blood test for the remainder of the pregnancy.  When I was admitted to the hospital when going in to labor, I had to have it done again as well.  Luckily I escaped without preeclampsia, and I  hope you are lucky as well! Congrats early on the little one.  Sorry I don't remember why I had protein in my urine? I think it was related to the blood pressure though.  I still had a slightly elevated blood pressure right up until after I had my son, but it never got to the point of preeclampsia.  They just told me to drink 8 ounces of water every hour that I was awake.  So I attribute that to what helped me get through it okay.|`|QufZeqlVaa	Preeclampsia seems to start because the placenta doesn't grow the usual network of blood vessels deep in the wall of the uterus. This leads to poor blood flow in the placenta.   Preeclampsia may run in families. If your mother had preeclampsia while she was pregnant with you, you have a higher chance of getting it during pregnancy. You also have a higher chance of getting it if the mother of your babys father had preeclampsia.   The mothers immune system may react to the father's sperm, the placenta, or the baby.   Already having high blood pressure when you get pregnant raises your chance of getting preeclampsia.   Problems that can lead to high blood pressure, such as obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, and diabetes, could raise your risk of preeclampsia.   High blood pressure usually doesn't cause symptoms. But very high blood pressure sometimes causes headaches and shortness of breath or changes in vision.    Mild preeclampsia usually doesn't cause symptoms, either. But preeclampsia can cause rapid weight gain and sudden swelling of the hands and face. Severe preeclampsia causes symptoms of organ trouble, such as a very bad headache and     You also will have a urine test to look for protein, another sign of preeclampsia.    If you have high blood pressure, tell your doctor right away if you have a headache or belly pain. These signs of preeclampsia can occur before protein shows up in your urine.    How are they treated?  You may be able to keep your blood pressure under control with a balanced diet and mild exercise. In some cases, you may also need to take medicine. You probably will get medicine if your bottom blood pressure number is 105 or higher.    The only cure for preeclampsia is having the baby. You may get medicines to lower your blood pressure and to prevent seizures. You also may get medicine to help your babys lungs get ready for birth. Your doctor will try to deliver your baby when the baby has grown enough to be ready for birth. But sometimes a baby has to be delivered early to protect the health of the mother or the baby. If this happens, your baby will get special care for premature babies.|`|aGxbD6snaa	usually you need both to be diagnosed with it, but it can vary. if you have high blood pressure they need to keep an eye on you, but if its starting to settle it should be ok although remember it does come and go. the fact you have protein in your urine would indicate pre-eclampsia but they would need all symptoms present to be sure. i was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia the day before 38 weeks although id had high blood pressure for almost the 2 months beforehand. i had protein in my urine when i was diagnosed but not after that even with high blood pressure. as long as you rest and eat/drink you can keep it under control up to the birth when by then its usually improved like mine did. dont worry youll be fine just dont get stressed or youll make it worse and it can be dangerous for you and your baby. good luck.|`|T9fek24eaa	My bp did that for a while until at my last ob appointment at 37 weeks it was skyrocketed. They sent me in for a non-stress test and did my bp ever 15 minutes, 24 hour urine, blood and all of those fun things and I ended up having pre-eclampsia and needing induced.     There is a certain level of protein you can have until they call it pre-eclampsia, but it sounds like you have the beginning stages of it to me. Its impossible to tell what your bp is doing all the time by just one reading. They should monitor your blood pressure for a few hours to see how its really doing. Also being swollen is another sign of pre-eclampsia. I was severly swollen to the point I got stretch marks on my legs and arms because I was so blown up with water.|`|DlipUzKAaa	The same thing happened to me.  I went in and had elevated blood pressure but urine was fine, then three days later I had protien in urine and slightblood pressure elevation.  I ended up getting induced, it was not that bad.  After my baby was born, everything went back to normal.
373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Hey hun!!    I know what you are going through TTC is a complete nightmare! After the first month you start torturing yourself thinking there is a problem. Then it seems like everyone around you is pregnant.    I just lost my baby at 19 weeks pregnant. It took me 10 months to conceive her, and I had 3 early miscarriages in that time too! I can't beleive my luck. This miscarriage was just out of the blue! (An infection caused me to go into labour)...    Anyway... You will get pregnant, I was on the depo for a year or so and I remember thinking the same as you. Try not to worry although I know that is easier said than done!    I also seemed to find that the months I thought I 'could be pregnant' were the months I weren't, but the months I just knew I wasn't... I was... If that makes sense.    So a little bit of hope for you there. I really wish you lots of luck and baby dust! It's such a hard thing to go through. I really thought I was out of all this.. but here I am back at square one! Oh my.. It's just like how a nightmare feels. But I'm awake!     GOOD luck everyone!!!! I really hope we ALL get our BFPS xxxxx|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Been where you are in the whole TTC thing.  Sorry I can not answer any questions about the Depo thing.  I can tell you not to dismiss the three days before ovulation because I was 5 days before and ended up Pg.  Keep trying.  Just try (and I know this is difficult) not to get too stressed out about it.  And once you have passed the one year mark make an appointment to have some tests done on you and your husband.  Women tend to always assume it is them.  Male testing is inexpensive in comparison to test that are done on women.  So have him checked first. If he checks out okay then follow up with the tests that your doctor recommends.  Hope this helps a little.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	hiya luvly,    u know what its perfectly ok and normal 2 feel pissed off with ttc and feel down.    people will say it will happen but what we want is a bfp now lol. hunni im sure things will be ok, just relax for a few weeks, i did over xmas, i drank when i wanted, had sex when i was in the mood and enjoyed it.    now im back ttc with a vengence lol. its like a challange for me now, billy might have crap sperm but it only takes 1 little bugger lol xxxxx    chick, we r all here 4 u and u can moan and rant as much as u like and il always listen, and do my best 2 offer u some advice.    lots of hugs  lola xxx|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	I was on the Depo shot for 3 years and got off of it a year before I got married because my doctor said it could take 1-2 years for me to get pregnant because of the shot. I had a miscarriage in September, nothing to do with the shoot just happened. So I wouldnt start to worry till you hit the year mark at this point go to your doctor and he/she can help you. One of my other friends look about 3 years because it messed her periods up so bad.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	I know how you feel! Hang in there hun! It took my hubby and I almost a year to get pregnant. I had to take Clomid cuz I don't ovulate on my own and no1 discovered it at my regular drs office so I got sent to an OB (i would pass months with no menses) So finally last week I found out we were expecting. So there is hope hun! I know that you prolly feel like your at the end of your rope! just hang in there!!!!!!       ps....sometimes it happens when you least expect it!|`|rmse6Mj8aa	Hi sweetie, sorry you're feeling down.  I haven't had the pleasure of being pregnant myself but I do know that you shouldn't lose hope this month. like I said to you the entire premise behind that gender selection technique of Dr Shettles is having sex 5,4 and 3 days before ovulation to conceive a girl. If that didn't get women pregnant then it couldn't be a valid method now could it?   The depo shot, I personally avoided but a friend of mine has been on it for years and she took about a year to conceive since her cycles took a while to level out. they say it takes at least 6 months for it to clear your system and for you to get back to ovulating on your own.    If your cycles are reasonably regular and you are ovulating then I very much doubt that there is any real basis for your concerns over your fertility. You are doing what we all do which is assuming you can't get pregnant because you haven't yet.   I think those thoughts all the time, but it is a natural fear and you have no reason to think anything is wrong with either you or your husband. It's 25% chance each month, they are some tough odds. You can be fertile and get it right on the timings and just not get there. You will get there you have to believe that when the time is right it will happen.     Maybe you need something to take your mind off the two week wait. Go out with friends, have sex for fun, have a nice dinner.. anything. just try to get your mind off ttc and relax. it will happen - I believe that.  xxx

GIIijxELaa	I can ease your mind! With my first son ( he is 6 now) nursing was soooo uncomfortable. Everyone tried to give me advice, but there was nothing that really helped. Once he got the hang of it and was latched properly, everything was fine. When my daughter (now 4) was born, it seemed much easier, maybe because she was better at it, maybe because I was, I'm not sure, but either way, it was less painful. Now with Preston (just 5 months) it is a wonderful bonding experience. There is no pain at all. He had developed thrush early on and passed it to me, so that made me sore, but I used the "violet cure" and it went away beautifully. It is the best experience so far with him. I think you are right when you say that you begin to feel like an expert. I think it may be, in part, due to the stigma that is still often attached to breastfeeding. Either we, as mothers, hear that we should be doing this perfectly and is 100% natural, or the other extreme, that it is a private thing and nobody wants to see it. Perhaps this contributes to the self doubt that may be lurking inside of us. It may be unconsiously hindering our progress. You as a mother and woman know that you are doing wonderfully already, and will do wonderfully (probably better) the second time around. Everything takes experience, no matter how much advice you get. Great job for nuturing your daughter the way you have.She will grow to be a strong and assured woman like her mother.  If you keep stimulating your nipples, you should have no problem with feeding your next baby (Congrats!). Have the confidence--- you are and will be great!|`|tOdjjeAmaa	I only nursed for 2 weeks and after getting all the help I could, it just hurt so bad all the time. I had to quit. I'm going to attempt to do it with my second, but I'm scared to death!! It was so painful and I guess we never got the hang of it. I keep hearing, from my mom and midwife that it's sooo much easier the second time around. So I'm a little hopeful. My mom nursed with me for 6 weeks, but with my younger brother for 6 months. They say you are a lot more relaxed and experienced with the second baby.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	If there is pain associated with breastfeeding, something is not being done right-whether it is your first or third (or more).  If you have trouble, consult your doctor or a lactation consultant.    I nursed all three of my children, and the ONLY pain I ever had was with my third.  The cause of it was my oldest child jumping on the water bed while I was nursing the baby-it caused quite a blister on my nipple and nursing her for a week or so after on that side was very painful.    If there is pain, you should gently detach the baby and start again.  Of course, if there is an improper latch you are going to experience pain and inadequate sucking can cause engorgement which can be painful.  But, again, it should not hurt whether it is the first or subsequent child you have nursed.|`|awRNr2VMaa	im not sure but it makes sense that it would. my aunt told me when i was pregnant with my first son to "rough" my nipples. take a washcloth while in the bathtub and rub against to rough them up. i ended up not breastfeeding but when you stop i would do that just to keep them less sensitive.|`|SONLm2Ilaa	If you are experiencing that kind of pain than your child is not latched on correctly, nursing should not be painful other than the raw nipple in the beggining! Maybe after your sixteen month old stop nursing you can continue pumping, this will help to keep your brest desensitized!
sstNdyYVaa	yeah im so sorry, i think she did cos thats wat happened to me. it was like a clump of tissue and my heart sank.    just advise her to be patient, if it is meant to happen it will..... everything will be ok, just give her some down to earth support.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Only a doctor can tell her if she miscarried, but it certainly sounds like she did.|`|9Ycuoysjaa	Sounds that there may be a possibility that she may of miscarried. sorry hun!!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	sadly sounds like she has  be ready to be a shoulder to cry on she will need u and u sound like u will be a good friend to have  x x x x
mNKboVB2aa	The Doctor will determine when/if you should be induced. I had the same situation as you! Every 2 days I had to be at the Doc's then she always sent me to the hospital! Have you had a Stress Test done? That will show you if the baby is in any sort of distress. Ask the doctor if you could lay on your left side, or just lay down before having your BP taken. Sometimes this will help. I'm not too sure how high your BP (blood pressure btw) can go before they take the baby. My sis in law just went through this as well, but she was spilling more protein in her wee, and they took her baby 8 weeks early.  I wish the best for you and your new baby!|`|T9fek24eaa	140/80. Anything past that is dangerous during pregnancy. If I were you I would start trying to bring on labor naturally (by walking, having sex, nipple stimulation, etc) so maybe you can get it started before you are induced. I dont blame  you for not wanting to be induced.     if you are not going to actively try to bring on labor, you really should be laying down with your feet above the level of your heart. It will help the swelling and the blood pressure. Sitting up in a chair with your feet up is not the same thing as laying down either. I found that out the hard way.
4Dc44BC5aa	Girl, I feel your pain I was the same way! I went 2 weeks passed my due date.

There are many natural induction techniques you can try on your own, with your partner or ask for assistance with.     Sex. Sex is the most well known induction technique because it works the best. Semen contains natural prostaglandins (cervical ripening agents) that can help your cervix ripen. In addition, sex or sexual activities are relaxing and that too can start labor. You may have to use some imagination, as most women are very uncomfortable in the last stages of pregnancy, but the effort might have you meeting your baby sooner rather than later Movement. Movement such as walking, skipping, lunging, swimming or swinging (on a park swing) can help labor to begin. It is believed these activities help the baby rotate into a good position for childbirth. Taking a bumpy car or train ride also has the same advantages Relax. The more you stop obsessing over when your baby is coming, the more likely labor will start. Labor will not begin in a stressed body Foods. Everyone has a favorite food that they claim will start labor. Spicy foods like pizza or sausage can help. But only because they irritate the bowels. Personally, I do not recommend this method because it can cause heartburn, cramping and diarrhea and who wants those things when labor begins? Fruit. Tropical fruit like pineapple, mango and kiwi actually contain an enzyme that may help tone your cervix. This fruit will probably not start labor, though with a toned cervix, early labor may go a little faster.   Talk to Your Baby. Some cultures believe that babies that have not been welcomed will not come into the world. It sounds silly, but talking to your baby and making them feel welcome may bring on labor.   Acupressure and Chiropractics. Some acupressure and chiropractic techniques can start labor. Talk to your care provider, friends or check the internet to find a practitioner in your area.   Castor Oil. Castor oil is an old technique that is not recommended anymore. It does the same thing spicy foods do, it irritates the bowels. It can also cause nausea and is pretty disgusting to ingest. In addition, castor oil rarely works.   Herbal Supplements. Herbal supplements like evening primrose oil (EPO), black and blue cohosh, red raspberry leaf tea and nettle tea are not recommended unless you have the permission of an herbalist or your care provider. Dosages for these supplements have not been determined, and taking too much can cause serious complications, including death, for your baby.|`|aLkCxq5aaa	I ate so many pineapples when I was due with my 2nd my lips, tongue and cheeks were raw!! It really hurt!.  And it did nothing for me I'm afraid.  I think it was the membrane sweep I had on my due date that actually started my slow labour.  But then I was already 3-4cms dilated at the time so I probably wasn't that far off anyway.      You've probably heard of most things like sex because the semen softens the cervix, walking, raspberry leaf tea etc.. so the only other one I can think of is if you've got a birthing ball, get on it as much as you can because the natural sitting position on the ball opens the pelvis for the baby's head to go lower, therefore to get to your cervix which will start off contractions.  Try rocking back and forth slowly and round and round and you may start to feel more pressure down there.    You could also ask your midwife to do a membrane sweep to see if that gets you started, worked for me anyway!    Good Luck and all the best xx|`|3Fma3URSaa	you just sit there until it comes and have fun with ur boyfriend|`|U2wJ4WrNaa	I'm not sure if it's true but I heard spicy foods can bring on labour. I hope it all goes well :)|`|0l7pyBSTaa	lol, yes honey, sex is the answer, you gotta get on that bugger and ride till your so outta breathe you can't go no more...give it a couple days and you should be ok....|`|fHgbL046aa	I heard of Castor Oil. Please do not take unless you talked with your doctor. With preeclampsia shouldn't you be in the hospital under a doctors care. I heard it care be pretty bad.|`|zuZKj3xXaa	there are 1 million ways to do so :) look it up on google haha|`|532XA7lkaa	I was induced at 41 weeks with my first baby.  Induction is not unhealthy and unsafe...it's not even painful!  Don't be concerned if it comes to that.  I understand you wanting things to naturally move along...but I just wanted to alleviate any worries about induction...|`|BlMfOIBCaa	When I was pregnant I had to be induced too my baby was a week late. I tried everything nothing worked but maybe it will work for you. I brought some mineral oil called Castro oil I but a table spoon in a cup of water and drunk it dont worry it's not going to do anything to the baby once you drink  it  wait about 30mins-1hr then go walking it suppose to make you use the bathroom if you feel a lot of pressure and you have to use the bathroom really bad go straight to the doctor because you are in labor.If it doesn't work and you have to be induced get all the rest you can because you are going to need it,once they give you potossin you are in for a ride. Good Luck!|`|MHNFnBzgaa	Sexual intercourse:   Female orgasms stimulate the first uterine contractions and semen contains the hormone prostaglandin, which softens the cervix, so having sex can be a double labour-starting whammy. On the downside, sex can be pretty difficult when your belly gets in the way, and you may not be feeling particularly sexy. Try lying on your side with your partner behind you, or on all fours with plenty of pillows to support your knees, or a bed or chair in front of you to support your forearms.    Nipple Stimulation:   When your nipples are stimulated (about 15 minutes of finger stimulation around the whole nipple area), oxytocin is produced, which can encourage uterine contractions. Some doctors advice against this method because there are reports that it brings on very painful contractions.     Drinking castor oil:   When your bowels are stimulated they produce prostaglandin, which helps to soften the cervix. Try adding a few drops of castor oil to orange, cranberry or grapefruit juice  stronger juice flavours can hide the taste. Bear in mind that castor oil will probably cause you to empty your bowels after about three hours, and can leave you feeling dehydrated so it is not recommended unless your GP or midwife give you the go ahead    Walking around the block:   When you walk your body releases oxytocin, which stimulates uterine contractions, so go for a brisk walk round the block once or twice a day, if you feel you can manage it. Walking allows your hips to swing from side-to-side which also encourages your baby into a good position for labour.     Homeopathy and acupressure:   Homeopathy has been used to help induce labour, but remedies are selected to suit each individual patient. Ask your midwife for details of recommended homeopathy practises in your area.Acupuncture uses fine needles that are inserted into energy points on your body to help induce labour. Again, ask your midwife for recommended Acupuncturists in your area.    Raspberry leaf tea:   Raspberry leaf tea can tone up the muscles in your uterus getting them ready for labour and can be drunk from 37 weeks onwards. They are available in tablet form if you dont like the taste of the tea.    Spicy Food: Some women swear by the curry method, but there is no evidence that it actually helps. Try eating a curry on, or after your due date    Pineapple:  Pineapple contains the enzyme bromelain which is thought to help soften the cervix. Tinned or canned pineapples do not count, so make a fresh fruit salad, or treat yourself to a ham and pineapple pizza.    Have a relaxing bath:   Some people believe that labour starts when your body decides its ready, so the thinking behind having a relaxing bath is to totally relax and prepare your mind for labour.Some women claim that adding clary sage essential oil to your bath can help to start contractions but also relexes you. At the very least, at least you can shave your legs if you can reach) in preparation for labour|`|sfZP0Cz2aa	i have heard the best way to bring on labour is to have sex but im not sure if its true|`|rt4OnxkYaa	these might all be wives tales.... but i've heard exercise helps.|`|acaddddd976fea5ce3ef78b4ac51f1e3aa	have hard insane hardcore sex, it will come out when u ***.|`|1zzhGvrXaa	Walk a lot and eat a lot of dates it will HELP|`|PUsezH7waa	having sex will help you go into labor|`|DVKWp9zZaa	I would call the doctor and see is he/she will stripe your membrane. It's a little painful, but nothing crazy. I had mine done than that night went into labor. I was 39 weeks. I also did a lot of walking, stretching, and sex. Good luck!|`|6621f41e355f2c01c2f2f17b816dc44caa	Use extreme caution with herbs, can be harmful to baby. When the apple is ripe it will fall from the tree. Maybe your exact conception date was incorrect. Go to the mall and walk.  Good luck happy delivery and healthy baby|`|vzDmaWqaaa	the baby is best off comming when it is ready as long as there is not problem.  I know it is silly but I was VERY ready to be done being pregnant and I started having sex with my husband several times that week and it was just a few days when I went into labor ( also its a good thing to do now because you will be in no condition for it for a while after the baby).  Extra sex is what did it for me and hubby liked that part too.    Your can also try massaging your stomach.  This will help the baby move into its correct position for delivery and help trigger labor Also you can call your doctor for other suggestions.|`|LGNyapa1aa	It's meant to be fresh pineapple, but when i was 40 weeks with my son i ate a whole fresh pineapple and it didn't work, he didn't come for another 6 days.    The ONLY one i have heard anything positive about is sex, my sister tried it and she went into labour the next morning (coincidence / the sex - who knows)     The orgasm is meant to trigger off contractions and there is also something in the seamen that encourages you to go into labour so keep it in there for a while :-)     Good luck x|`|65de15f23f2269f4a1cd8334a7b742f9aa	Walking, jumping up and down, spicy food and sex.|`|fxtzVZuuaa	why don't u try spicy food that's supposed to help start labour !!!  gd luck with the baby|`|h9TEL6zHaa	Congratulations and GOOD LUCK!  I know of a couple things...  1. You are right about the sex! They say a good O can induce labor - all those muscles contracting!!  also something to do with the sperm...  2. Walking - A LOT can help!  3. Stair climbing  4. Nipple stimulation  5. Pressure points or acupuncture- you have to go to a professional!  6. Nipple stimulation    below is an article you can read... but to warn you - I have heard HORROR stories about castrol oil - it makes you have diarrhea badly - so I WOULD NOT do that if I were you!    Again - good luck!!! I'll be thinking about you!|`|ooadGX6Laa	Not sure if any of them work, but heard that:    1- Eat a curry, this encourages bowel movement which can bring on labour.    2 - Walking as the pressure of the babies head will encourage your cervix to dilate.    3 - Having sex, as one of the chemicals in sperm is what is used when they induce you.    4. Nipple Stimulation - This increases one of the hormones in your body which can trigger labour, but aparently this only works if you stimulate for approx 1 hour, 3 times a day. (So this is probably a bit too time consuming.)    There are plenty of wives tales, but personally, I think that the baby will only come when its ready. I just hope huni that yours will come soon, I am only 38 weeks and already had enough so can imagine you are MORE then ready to meet your little one.    I am worried about having to be induced, as I REALLY want my baby to come soon, but one of the advantages of getting induced is you can tidy house, get everything ready at home, have a nice bath and pamper yourself a bit before you go into hosiptal rather then labour catching you by suprise, thats the only advantage I can think of. lol.    Good luck. xx

0sJsTN83aa	It depends on the state, but unless your sister and your nieces father agree to terminate their parental rights to you and your husband, you will have a very difficult time.  If she wants her daughter, the courts will not likely ever terminate her rights.  My sister tried to adopt a little boy whose father beat him black and blue (he was hospitalized twice), the state still wouldn't terminate his rights.      If you get custody of your niece, and the parents do not see or pay support for her for over one year, you can try to adopt on those grounds (this is what my sister eventually did, and it worked).    Otherwise you 1) have to be able to prove abuse, 2) prove that you will be a better home, and 3) go through all the hoops of the court to be allowed to adopt your niece.  You will have to have a lawyer, physicals, sometimes a mental health check, a home study, etc - and this is required even if you already have children.    It is a long, difficult road, and the process is set up to protect the parents rights more than the child's, so if you don't think your sister will agree I would tread lightly here.  All she has to do is come to court and say she wants her daughter and they will allow her to try and rehabilitate herself, whether it's in the child's best interest or not.  Also keep in mind that if a social worker can't find any evidence of abuse or neglect, the child will be returned to her, and it is very likely to divide your family.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	I don't know where the daughter is right now, hopefully with you.  Here is what you need to do.  Ask the family services in your area to help you get an emergency temporary guardianship order.  This will give you legal guardianship.  This will only be temporary which gives the family services time to evaluate you and your home for permanent placement.  This usually takes a couple of months.  At the end of that time you will have a date to go to court and if family services find you fit. (Really got to be a screw up not for them to find you fit) the judge will order permanent guardianship.  If your sister agrees, you can adopt later.  But adoption requires her and the father to give up their parental rights.  Guardianship doesn't but it is also permanent.  I kniow this because I had to do the same thing with my grandchildren.  This allows you to put them on your insurance and they are elligible to some county programs.  Red|`|vwTyihvvaa	You have everything working in your favour. However, the biological mother and father would still have to sign over their parental rights which could be an issue.|`|eDnWMm3maa	I would think that all of those things would work in your favour. I have a friend who is raising her fiance's two daughters because child and family services deemed their mother to be unfit (meth addict). In order to get temporary custody of the second, they had to go through the foster parent screening. You may have to do something like that, but it's not something to be nervous about.|`|BTuFtui3aa	The first thing you need to do is to make a report to Child Protective Services. Describe the abuse and neglect, and ask them to investigate. I suggest making a police report as well.    Chances are, they will remove the child from the home and take her to an emergency placement. Relatives are given first priority to take custody, once they're checked out for safety. You can become the child's guardian, and if the mother's parental rights are terminated by the state because of the abuse, you can adopt (all this of course assuming you pass the homestudy and criminal background check.)    Please focus on getting this reported to the authorities before worrying about adoption. Adoption can be a slow, complicated process, and a child who is being abused needs immediate help.|`|984c0feac5fcb2b2527360725a42fac5aa	Largely reiterating what others have said.  Focus on getting the child out of the bad situation and worry about the adoption later.    File the report, or better yet, if you have other people who have also seen the abuse/neglect, also have them file reports.  CPS/DCFS will assign a case worker and determine of the child will need to be removed.  If the child IS removed, the case working will first want to place the child with family.  Unless there is someone else vying for the child, you will be first in line to have the child placed with you.  You will need to be able to prove you can and are willing to provide support.      If the child is placed for adoption, it will be a long process, perhaps as much as 2 years.  A lot depends on the severity of the abuse/neglect, the willingness of your sister to work with the case worker on getting the child back, and if your sister tries to fight the case (i.e. hires a bulldog lawyer).  It is likely that even if everyone agrees the child should be permanently removed, it will likely take a year before her parental rights are terminated, and 4-6 months of paper work, home studies, and negotiations before things are finalized.|`|AXshzI0Kaa	If your niece is with you then you would be or should be the best choice for permanent placement should the child's goal change to adoption. If parental rights have not been terminated, then your sister may be working a treatment plan and may get her daughter back.     Where is dad in all of this?? If the dad is KNOWN then he would be afforded a treatment plan as well....and either one could be reunited with their child.     How long?? By Federal law, courts can move to terminate if the child has been in custody for 15 of the most recent 22 months. Look up the Adoptive Safe Family Act (AFSA) and that by law is in there. Sometimes it can take a long time to terminate rights. Mom and/or dad could be moving right along, working a treatment plan and take a couple of years to do it (not likely) and then fall off the proverbial wagon and that long in to the case....parental rights are then petitioned for termination.     My advice to you.....keep providing a stable home for your niece and stay involved with the juvenile proceedings. If mom (and/or dad) do not reunify with her, then you would be my choice for adoptive placement.....just because you have had her, she is bonded, she is stable, you are stable and can provide the basic necessities and then some....plus allow her to stay connected to her family and kin.     Take care!!|`|Afoabqblaa	Sounds like you are an infertile who is trying to snatch your sis's kid for your own.|`|AKJwWqdZaa	First of all, I want to commend you for doing the right thing and protecting your niece even though it must have been hard to turn in your sister. There are too many family members who turn a blind eye to abuse because doing something would be too hard (on them of course).     The process differs from state to state or province to province, so you should contact an attorney right away. I do believe you would have a strong case for custody as you are family. The only road blocks I see is if the father wishes to gain custody. Also, children's services may also resist terminating your sister's rights and allow her to work a plan in order to regain custody of her daughter. So get yourself a lawyer, and personally, I would also look into getting your neice into counselling as it sounds like she has been through a lot.    Good luck!!|`|i2sMBoPIaa	If you reported it to DSS, then a family member is looked at first so the child will not have to go into foster care. A family member also gets the first choice of adoption if they are finacially capable & stable . The process will take a lot less time, but it is usually tied up in the courts for several months. The child lives with you during the whole process & can't be taken away unless the parents go thru everything required of them to regain custody. Remember the state's main goal is to get the parents back w/ their child if at all possible. If the abuse is repeatedly known, they can face TPR forced by the state if the judge approves.

I4a8zI1gaa	are you my sister-in-law?? are you talking abotu dylan?? lol.. jk...  but some babies have more difficult temperaments than others, and sleeping is also difficult for them.  If he wakes up more than once or twice at night for reaasons other than a bottle (If he is draining a bottle at his feeding and giong right back to sleep, that's fine.. and they should continue to feed him)....  than i'd say it's a separation issue.     If they know he's not in pain, it's nto teething, his ears, hunger, too hot/ too cold, or a dirty diaper - than they can possibly let him fuss a little when he wakes up.  The thing about it is every parent is different.  If he's craving that attention adn affection at night, is he getting enough during the day?  I don't think there is such thing as "too much TLC" for a baby or child.  But if he's not sleeping because he needs his mommy or daddy, then they need to start just going in there, rubbing his back, giving him a binky, etc without picking him up or talking to him.     He's getting older now and the more they respond to his cries, the more he will cry at night to get what he wants.  By all means i'm sure it's hard just to flat out IGNORE him when he cries at night, but not going to the full extent to cuddle him may be something they want to start trying.    EDIT:  babies need to be cuddled.  babies cry because it's the only way to communicate.  if they didn't "fuss" they'd never be able to advance in development, they'd never learn, they'd starve to death, they'd be unhappy and alone and grow up to be very dull/ unintelligent/ depressed individuals.  LOL.  PLus, some babies are more curious than others.  Good for your brother and his girlfriend.. they're doing the right thing by responding to their baby's needs!!|`|pXSKSS3daa	Are your brother and his girlfriend worried about it? If not, I'd leave it alone. This is their baby, not yours, so stop telling them what to do with him.    Some babies just DON'T sleep through the night until they are much older(sometimes not until 2, even 3 years in age). There isn't anything necessarily wrong with them, that's just the way it ends up being.     Also, there is not one thing wrong with holding your baby. So what if they want to hold him? That is their business. I hold my son whenever he wants it, I'm not going to deny him of that just because I think he shouldn't be held a lot(Luckily, for him, I DON'T think this way).|`|68c6B8dRaa	"I tried to tell my brother and his girlfriend not to hold him all the time but they didn't listen."    Wow, loving auntie of the year. Way to go.    Your nephew is normal. Good for his parents for cuddling him.|`|1Mq3Vh5oaa	what is he eating before bed..and yea holding all the time he may want someone to hold him while he sleeps or he will wake up. he is constantly cranky??? if so i just saw a show on CBS about a little boy who was sleep deprived and he had a brain disorder...they had to do surgery, not saying this is whats wrong but its good to know all the options|`|h9tNr8vFaa	have you tried bringing him to the hospital or try not holding him so much my sisters baby never use to sleep and we had to bring him to the hospital. how long has this been going on. his teeth are probably coming in and he cant sleep have you tried putting on baby origell.l|`|aEmdURPTaa	All children are different. Is that child breastfed?  Were the parents able to discover the natural sleeping schedule of their child and work around that?  Some will take several shorter naps, others just a single long one in the middle of the day.      The fact that they hold their child to help him fall asleep may indeed mean that he doesn't like falling asleep on his own, but it shouldn't have an effect on his sleep style and duration.  And he'll grow out of that in his own time too.  He's just a baby after all.      This is a period where it is more important for a child to build a trusting relationship with his parents, than to become an independent human being.  It seems that your brother and his girlfriend have understood that by continuing to hold him to fall asleep.  They are simply providing their child with what he needs.    My niece is only three months old and sleeps about 9 hours in a row, but she's bottlefed.  My 5-month old daughter wakes up every 2 hours at night, and naps about every 2-3 hours during the day, but for only about 25 to 40 minutes each time, but she's breastfed and has a reflux disorder.  So you see how each child is different?    We, as parents, just need to remain flexible and go with the flow.  It's less pressure and less stressful that way, both for the parents and the children.
wi6mkT30aa	I think Emmaly is cute! Why do people thing a spelling of a childs name (First or middle) is going to get them teased? That makes no sense it's a dang spelling!

Good luck and congrats on your lil one! =)|`|HurPmgSaaa	suggestions::  Emma-Leigh  Emmaleigh  Emaleigh  Emilie    I like Brielle as the middle name.|`|utfoP7GWaa	I think the name (in any form) is overused in the last few years.     food for thought: do you want your child to have the same name as everyone in there k-5 class?|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Emma Leigh or Emily -- I do not like Emmaly.  That spelling is the worst.  Classic example of giving the child trouble her whole life having to correct people on the spelling.  Just go with the classic spelling.  It's going to sound the same anyway!|`|ewDKMeJkaa	Emmaly Brielle|`|heC9aQ18aa	It sounds like someone who did want to name her child Emily and either did not know how to spell it correctly or tried to make it look different by butchering the spelling. No, I don't like Emmaly at all. Spelled like that, regardless of your intentions makes you look like you don't know how to spell or like you are trying too hard to be kreatyve (creative). Sorry, did not mean to be harsh but wanted to be honest. Ann is too common of a middle name but you did not ask about that. The name in the end Emmaly makes it different but in a bad way. Makes you look uneducated. Get it? I am sure you are educated so why spell the name to look as if you aren't. If you like Emma Lee then spell it that. Saves you a lot of trouble in the future but most of all it will save the child a lot of trouble when she has to correct people all of her life about the spelling of her name.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I think it looks like something a teenager would do; take a perfectly good name and mess it up.|`|QBKzvw4faa	My bestfriends middle name is emily.. but spelt.. Emma-Leigh.. i always loved that spelling.. I also love the name Brielle.. but not as a middle name.. so maybe Emma-Leigh Ann.. really cute =)|`|TAufQoc7aa	It doesnt look right spelt that way. Go for Emaleigh, Emilie, Emalie, Emmalie, Emalee|`|ygGr1nX7aa	You asked for opinions, so... I don't like it, I'm afraid.  It looks like a misspelling, or two different names crashed together, and do you want people's first impression on seeing your child's name to be 'that's spelled wrong?'  Your child will most likely go through life having to spell it all the time, and people will get it wrong constantly.  All of which can be really annoying.  Yes, It's original, but perhaps you should ask yourself if you're doing that for your child or for you.    Emma-Lee is nicer, even if that one will have to be spelled out all the time too.|`|vOD4Urzdaa	I like Ann as a middle name for that. I like one of the other suggestions on how to spell the name though. I think it was Emma-Leigh. That looks cute.|`|qxnxm0YLaa	Emmaly is definitely a unique spelling of an easy-to-spell name! However I suggest Emma-Leigh or Emma-Lee and the middle name should definitely be Brielle because it's so much cuter than Ann!
fYMWDQLGaa	hi    u should not be this much worried before something is confirmed abt ectopic. dont be tensed it is not good for ur health and mainly to the baby's health. Pls don panic reading some internet posts.. we see that menstrual cramps are more common. also, did u see the posts stating cramps good because the implatation is good. those who didnt have  cramps , miscarried.so its good to have cramps.. pls dont panic.. be patient listen to songa and yoga to relax urself... dont think too many things and confuse ur mind.. this is the time u should be patient and relaxed. if u r going to be worried till 10th of feb, it is no good to ur health n ur kid..    ectopics cases are very few. dont u worry    take care dear..|`|RPszYGXkaa	Congrats!  It is really normal!  I remember thinking I had a molar pregnancy in the beginning...how relived was I at the first U/s to see my little baby, just fine!  Just try to relax and enjoy this time in your life.  All will be well!  I have been pregnant before with my daughter, and felt like I couldn't wait for the next things...next scan, next trimester, etc.  When I finally conceive  2, I am going to promise myself to just enjoy the moment I am in, b/c trust me it flies by.  Best wishes!  Take care of yourself and stop reading about all the "what if" scenarios!|`|2G8lOPN8aa	First off--congrats!  As for the rest--I am sure it is just nerves.  The chances that you will have an etopic pregnancy is less than one in 50.    Since this is the issue currently keeping you up at night--here some of the risk factors that might increase a woman's odds of having an etopic pregnancy--if you don't have any of these factors--then maybe it will help you worry a little less.      How can I tell if I'm at risk for an ectopic pregnancy?    An ectopic pregnancy can happen to any sexually active woman, but certain women are more at risk than others. Your odds of having an ectopic pregnancy are higher if:    ?  You get pregnant despite having had a tubal ligation (surgical sterilization).    ?  You've had surgery on your fallopian tubes to correct a problem or to reverse a tubal ligation. (Your risk is also higher, though to a much smaller degree, if you've had other pelvic or abdominal surgery, such as the removal of an ovarian cyst or fibroids, an appendectomy, or a cesarean section.)    ?  You had a previous ectopic pregnancy.    ?  Your mother took the drug DES while pregnant with you.    ?  You have an intrauterine device (IUD) in place when you get pregnant. Although IUDs are close to 99 percent effective at preventing pregnancy, if you do get pregnant while using one, it's more likely that the pregnancy will be ectopic. An IUD doesn't cause an ectopic pregnancy, it's just better at preventing an egg from implanting in your uterus than outside it. (Having used an IUD in the past won't raise your risk for ectopic pregnancy.)    ?  You're taking progestin-only hormonal contraceptives when you get pregnant. As with an IUD, taking these pills doesn't increase your risk for an ectopic pregnancy, but if you do get pregnant while taking them, the likelihood that it will be ectopic is higher than usual.    ?  Your tubes were damaged by an infection in your upper reproductive tract (this is called pelvic inflammatory disease or PID). PID is often caused by untreated sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. It sometimes has no symptoms, so having had either of these STIs also increases your risk for an ectopic, even if you don't think you've had PID.    ?  You're being evaluated or treated for infertility. Infertility is often caused by damaged tubes, and if you get pregnant while being treated for infertility, there's a higher than average chance that the pregnancy will be ectopic.    Older women also have higher rates of ectopic pregnancy. And a few studies suggest you may also have a slightly increased risk for ectopic pregnancy if you smoke cigarettes or douche regularly.    * * *    Good luck!  Pregnancy is scary--so your fears are normal, but try to adopt the attitude that you can not change anything by worrying--all you will do is stress yourself out.  When there is something to worry about--then you can worry. Otherwise try to relax a bit more!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i did the same thing with both of mine. just don't panic.. and don't worry until you have a reason to do so. there is nothing you can do about any of it. so just chill. i'm sure everything will be alright.|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Ok first of all do you have reason to be worried about an ectopic pg?  Relax and have you scan.  Cramping is not uncommon.  You are pg.  try not to give you self things to worry about until you are given a reason to worry.  And well welcome to the world of parenting.  It begins in pregnancy and never ends.  Best wishes to you.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	I KNEW IT.  I knew you'd do the same thing as me.  Remember me telling you that?  Once you find out you really are pregnant you'll relax and when the ultrasound comes you'll start panicking again wondering if the baby is really there?  *huggles*  Don't worry!  I had the same fears that mine was an ectopic and my son really was in my womb.  So, I'm 100% so will your baby.  Don't worry dear!|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	i know its hard but try to stay as positive as you can . and be strong for your self . everything has a way of working out|`|jrVlzffeaa	Don't worry I think everyone goes through that phase of thinking what if...? Just try to enjoy being pregnant, and just remember that worrying isn't gonna do you any favors. P.S. Just so you know now that you're gonna be a mummy you will ALWAYS be worrying about your child and what could/might happen!! lol. Good luck and congrats Xx|`|ehvzQRkkaa	The worrying never ends!   I thought that once I had my son and I knew he was safe and sound and healthy I would stop worrying, but I still worry!  It never goes away! You are a mommy now and that's just how we are!    Welcome to mommyhood!|`|xpstigPTaa	Your going to be just fine so please be calm...Stressing is not good because the baby feels your stress which is bad. The less you stress and the more laid back you are, the easier things will be. I know it is easier said than done but you should really be enjoying your pregnancy. This is your time to have a child and I have no douct in my mind that it is going to happen for you this time. Try to relax, watch a funny movie and have fun picking out things for the baby. We are here for you! Let us know how your scan goes, I am sure you will be absolutely fine!|`|b97ab27d62fac407e8f40fe52edd9ae1aa	Like everyone else is saying, stay calm and enjoy your pregnancy. Easier said than done, I know. But you are going to worry yourself into problems. It's the "too good to be true" but you will be fine and your baby will show and be a-ok.|`|RE6GBw0Baa	hunni,    ur going to be a mommy, the worry will never stop lol. just shows how great ur going to be.    try not 2 worry hunni, unless something happens, enjoy these weeks as they go so quickly xxxxx    luv ya hun xxx u lill worry head lol. i think u should have a new name lol. worryhead mommy 2 be lol big hugs 2 u and bump xxxx
723QHuicaa	I had an extemely hungry baby. I switched at 6m to follow on, from hungry baby. I had been weaning for approx 2m by this point however, so my LO was eating solids 2-3 times a day, plus snacks.    Id start her off with the solids, dont even let her see the bottle. Then when she becomes full, or disinterested in the food, top her off with milk.  also introduce snacks - soft fruits are great - banana, pear (warm it if its a little hard) melon, etc    Once she gets used to eating solids on a regular basis through the day, she will most likely just be more interested in foo, as my LO was.    As for which milk is heavier, I think the both have the same calories, just different constitutions on pro-biotics, vitamins, immuno fortis etc.|`|73RKIlQkaa	I have just switched to Aptamil follow on because it has the right nutrients to go with when you are first weaning the baby. It is different to the extra hungry I can't remember exactly why (it might be more iron) but I checked out the Aptamil site. ) in fact I joined it and got a free cuddly polar bear too.
CuCrGDuRaa	No, at 5 weeks your baby is just a tiny speck.  However, being pregnant causes bloating, gas, and constipation which give the appearance of a larger stomach.  I'm 16 weeks pregnant with twins and still just have a tiny bump and can easily pass as not being pregnant.|`|W0d6NsGBaa	your not showing a baby but you could be bloated. No bigger then you would be during your period.|`|vzDmaWqaaa	You can see some change in your stomach at five weeks that is a result of pregnancy but its not really "showing"  many women experience Bloating and changes in their stomach while there body is changing from a normal cycle to making a baby.  this bloating like normal period bloating should subside.  Also you may have been eating more which will help with a little extra showing.  the newly forming baby will also be putting pressure on your organs causing everything to start moving around.  You may also start thinking about the possibility of multiples.  Women that start showing earlier have a much higher probability of multiples showing up on the ultrasound.  I mean it just makes sense more babies take up more space.  For now just sit back and check out some names.  You have a baby coming which is something alot of people only dream of.  Good Luck to you.  Enjoy your little Blessing from heaven.|`|N2fIorzGaa	its not possible for the baby to show but it is  possible to be bloated at 5 wks no i haven't been pregnant be for but iv been around 8 different pregnant women and watched the pregnancy process from day one my sister in law is 7 wks pregnant now|`|TljXiSNnaa	well i was bloated and it looked like a lil  pot belly lol!!! every womens different im now almost 3 months and im showin pretty well!!! good luck....and have a safe pregnancy|`|Dhsyroekaa	no, baby is soo small.  maybe she needs glasses? hahaha|`|eDnWMm3maa	No. You could be bloated from pregnancy, but the baby isn't even the size of a grain of rice at this point.|`|158e8f51e731e93ad7f2eb5b83dc2c28aa	No...the fetus is so small that there is no way it would produce a bump.  However, some women can see the "pregnancy glow", that's possible.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	you're probably just bloated. i doubt you're already showing. especially if you can still wear your regular jeans|`|r2EBoqyiaa	am five weeks and am the same I dnt no eaither whats going on I think am just bloating coz baby is only half an inch so doubt thats gonna make much impact lol x gud luck anyway|`|ME62Mtv4aa	well you do get a little bloated in the first few months so yes it is possible.|`|NxNrZksXaa	you are becoming bloated. it's just the water inside you, it's not the baby (yet)|`|DVKWp9zZaa	You can show in different ways besides your stomach. Your skin gets a glow to it, clears up, your moods change, your eating habbits, and you can also seem more excited than normal. If your small built though you may see a slight difference in your tummy. Congrats by the way!|`|7d632fbyaa	IT COULD HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS YOU. BE BLESS
W0d6NsGBaa	Just eat healthy, rest when needed and DON'T STRESS!!! Miscarriages DO happen and they are semi-common but there is nothing you could do to cause one or prevent one (except maybe if you did lots of drugs or something) I was a nervous wreck weeks 5-12 but my little girl is great. Don't read too much of the books either. Those will drive you NUTS|`|AA12107422	I found out I was pregnant at only 3.5 weeks & it was the longest few weeks of my life to get to 16 weeks. I believe its a critical time up until 15 weeks if I am not mistaken. First thing, don't stress! That will only make matters worse, & put you and the baby under more stress. Your body is making alot of changes, so the less stress the better. I know it's hard not to think about it, but try to take it easy & get your mind off of the pregnancy. Get a good book -- watch some tv -- hang out with a friend -- go shopping -- create a new hobby -- or take some long needed naps! Good Luck & Don't fret, you will be just fine ?|`|bAp35x7uaa	Firstly, try not to worry.     Secondly make sure you're taking a good prenatal vitamin    Thirdly try to eat as well as possible.  HOWEVER, that's easier said than done if you're throwing up everything or feeling sick at the mere mention of the word 'vegetable' (as I am - I can't even have brocolli in the same room as me without getting sick at the smell).      If you're having a problem with nausea or vomiting, then eat what you can, when you can but try to cut out sugary and processed foods.       Make sure you drink plenty of water (around 8 x 8oz glasses a day)     But most importantly, try to relax.  Your body is still getting used to being pregnant and these first three months last an absolute age what with all the twinges, strange cramps, back ache, green poo (yes, green poo - apparently it's caused by the extra iron in my prenatal supplements), generally getting used to being preggers and waiting for the 12 week scan; then the 20 week scan; then the birth LOL!.      Take care my lovely. And congratulations to you.      xxx|`|BU1f41Wcaa	Eat right and try not to stress to much. And get plenty of sleep:)   Good luck and congrats|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Eat healthy, no heavy lifting and relax as much as you can.|`|WsUSAgLmaa	Eat healthy and take your prenatal vitamins.
eDnWMm3maa	I like Matthew and Anthony.    I don't think either is overused. People are too busy coming up with ridiculous made-up looking names to go with the traditional ones anymore. Besides, what's important is that you and your family love the name.|`|a1UkVGpHaa	Matthew and Anthony.|`|ewDKMeJkaa	Out of the 3, Matthew    i love lucas though|`|w0eRRsoVaa	What about combining Matthew Anthony or Luca Anthony/Anthony Luca, etc.?  I'm personally a fan of Matthew (my brother's name) and Anthony.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i'm naming the boy i'm carrying now lucaS.    but i do like anthony best. and it is a great way to honor people. oh, maybe matthew anthony. that way you get your favorite and the honor in there!|`|xrJqmRFqaa	I adore the name Luca.  If you want to use Anthony and honor your family, I like Anthony Luca or Luca Anthony.|`|sQYsMbQyaa	MATTHEW|`|IvkNTqDMaa	Luca is the best...it's different. Matthew and Anthony are waaaaaaaay overused.|`|lmGx31vvaa	Luca definitely.|`|vOD4Urzdaa	All very sweet. I think you should use one as a first and another as a second. You could always give him 2 middle names as well.     Matthew Anthony Luca sounds cute. Bit long though.    I like Anthony Luca. But Matthew Luca sounds very sweet as well.    Alone I like all three. Two of my cousins (opposite sides) are named Mathew. I adore them both :)|`|qxnxm0YLaa	Anthony is my fav from your list. I would probably pair Anthony & Matthew together for a first and middle name.|`|80Zlwifsaa	Well, i am partial to Matthew, it is my husband's name and my son's middle name. My son is David Matthew. David after my father and Matthew after my husband, they are both biblical names and they are common but not overused. Not alot of people are naming their babies these names right now.    I really like Luca for a boy or a girl. How about Matthew Luca?|`|l1BG0Y9Daa	matthew is cool. Then they'll call him "mat".|`|O312XoP9aa	Hi,,     I love ARTHUR      Cheers|`|7d632fbyaa	DYLAN I love that name my husband named Dylan to our son. I asked him why that name and he said because of Bob Dylan is a famouse singer.     DYLAN. GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS YOU. BE BLESS|`|Xye9cx5eaa	I like the combination: Lucas Anthony (I think it goes better together if you add the 's' to Luca)    ...Or Anthony Lucas, if you think that Luca as a first name does not suit your son.|`|4GBdRXm5aa	I really like Matthew.  If I were expecting a boy I'd call him Matthew Elijah.  Not so keen on Luca, as that name only suits a certain type of boy. You'll know though when he's born if he caould suit Luca or not.  I wouldn't say Anthony is a favourite of mine, however, if it was a family name I would consider it. Maybe even as a middle name.
kprKXEOSaa	I used fenugreek, as well as blessed thistle.  You can use a couple different herbs together.  Other good ones are fennel, marshmallow, nettle, red raspberry, and milk thistle.    The dosage you're taking should be good, maybe just add another herb and take them together.  And of course, make sure you're drinking plenty of pure water, when I was breastfeeding last time I would drink 16 oz of water every time I nursed during the day, which came out to about twice what I normally need.    And, make sure you're eating plenty of healthy calories.  Cutting calories or not eating balanced meals makes your body think there's a famine, and the milk supply is the first thing to go.  Good luck!|`|k4SlMtYHaa	When I started a breastfeeding friendly birth control I still found my milk supply dwindled.  My gyno had me take two pills 2x per day of the 180 capsules, and nothing more.  Too much isn't the best for the baby.  You only need to take it long enough to establish a good milk supply.  I found that within about 48 hours my milk supply did come back and within two weeks I discontinued.  I was told that you know you are getting sufficient when you sweat the "maple syrup" smell.  My daughter smelled like it too and she didn't seem to mind any change in flavor.  I did notice some cramping similar to when I had just had the baby.  It isn't recommended if a person thinks they are pregnant again (it can cause a miscarriage!)  Fun fact: Fenugreek itself is used in small amounts for cooking.|`|XKfrNzhUaa	i was planning on trying fenugreek or  fennel tea but i haven't made it to the store yet so i eat oatmeal (it needs to be the real stuff, not instant) and that worked. i dont know how but it did for me. also i pump a lot. my milk comes out to slow for my baby to get full. he stays latched on for over an hour at a time. i took a sauna and my milk come pouring out (i had a puddle on the bench) so now i eat a bowl of oatmeal in the morning and take a suana once a day and he eats in a half hour and gets full.     i think you need to take a lot and it might take a while for it to start helping.|`|lFBqeTFNaa	I had no luck with the herbs either.    My experience:  Drink alot of water, get plenty of rest and rent a pump from the hospital.  It's only about $50 per month, but much cheaper than formula in the long run.    The more you pump, the more you should produce.|`|WmXOfXqhaa	Our pediatrician suggested taking three of the 610 mg capsules three times a day.  I did not notice a huge increase in my supply, but I did notice a slight increase.  I also noticed more of an increase if I took the fenugreek for a couple of weeks and then stopped taking it for a week or so.  I would see an increase when I wasn't taking it.    Another supplement I used was Mother's Milk Tea.  You should be able to find this at the same place you bought the fenugreek.  If not, you can find it online.  This also helped with my supply, but again it wasn't a huge increase.|`|AA10167940	The only thing that increases your supply is your baby.  If you feed on demand, then your baby will be getting all the milk they need.  There are no herbs, potions or magic pills that increase your supply.  Pumping can actually decrease your supply-|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I took 2 pills 3 times a day for about two months.  I did not actually notice an improvement in my supply, but there were so many factors involved, it's hard to tell what was causing what.    I do know that it made my breast milk, sweat and urine smell like maple syrup.  Weirdest side effect ever!|`|ehvzQRkkaa	I took Fenugreek with Blessed Thistle, taking about that much a day  I also take Domperidone, it is the only thing that really does anything for my supply! You need a prescription for it though    www.drjacknewman.com    EDIT: Thanks for the thumbs down ladies--MY SON DOES NOT LATCH FOR MEDICAL REASONS AND ALL I CAN DO IS PUMP AND THEREFORE NEED A SUPPLEMENT THANK YOU!
AA12107422	SEX! No lie. That's what worked for TWICE! I had both of my babies a little early. 38w5d & 39w2d. Just slightly early, but I was nice to finally go into labor & meet my loves. I also tried rasberry tea from Target, heard it was suppost to make contractions start -- & boy did it! I wouldn't recommend that until your at least 38-39w tho. It started contractions but they were just annoying & stopped. I think the sex did the trick both times tho. Good Luck!! Not too much longer to go! Congrats ?|`|fMxVDps3aa	It will happen whenever. I lost my plug 1 week before I went into labor and was 4cm. that means not too much.|`|YTOrDW3haa	got to the hospital! if you lost your mucus plug, you need to go!|`|K542Db29aa	walk once or twice a week and sex when is good for you, try and get your belly to drop! im 35weeks with number 3 and trying to get mine going too, i have never lost my mucus plug except at the hospital in labor. i get checked nxt week im hoping something has happened...good luck :)|`|qpbV2VyJaa	lol you dont need to go to the hospital. now you wait. I was the exact same at 37 w. and labor didn't start til 39w 1 day|`|r0M7gVP7aa	You don't need to g to the hospital once you lose your mucous plug. If you want to get labor going you can use castor oil. You put a little bit of it in your drink during the day only and it makes you have a HUGE bowel movement which sometimes makes you go into labor.     You can get your husband (or a masoose) to rub your feet and legs. Right underneath the bump of the bone on the side of your foot (forgot what it's called) is the spot people rub to get labor going. Basically anywhere from there to mid calf will help.    Sex is the other obvious thing.      You aren't even at your due date though, so you shouldn't be trying to get labor going. The best thing for your baby is to just let it come out at it's own time. Remember, a due date isn't THE DAY the baby has to be born by. It's a rough estimate. Just enjoy the last few weeks of your pregnancy and try not to think about getting the baby out. Before you know it, your little bundle of joy will be here!    Good luck! And try to be patient! :)
70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	There are always certain circumstances where a soldier's commander can let them travel back to the States for certain things...wife in labor being one of them.  Unfortunately, it is not a requirement and in most cases will be denied due to "Needs of the Army."|`|eFB2jLVbaa	http://www.dfas.mil/army2/militarypay/mi...    that's all you need to know hope it helps|`|Mjl2ygUiaa	Nope, that's not considered an emergency|`|VFUdAtrHaa	Yes there is. I don't know what its called though. My uncle was deployed in Iraq And he was allowed to come home a week before the baby was born and stay a week after wards. Good luck !|`|T9fek24eaa	No. There is nothing that they HAVE to give you. If it was an emergency he may be able to get home through the Red Cross, but unfortunately the military can not do this for births. If they did there would be entirely too many people coming home on emergency leave.     IF he is state side he MAY get 10 days called "Daddy Days."  But again, they do not have HAVE to give you that.... I know, the military royally screws alot of people, Im sorry. :(    I think these people are thinking of the mid-tour. When you are deployed for 6 months and come home for 2 weeks. There is nothing they have to let him take. Like someone else said its all up to his commander.|`|1CVOHoapaa	In the UK you can get annual, compassionate and paternity leave. I am ex RN and when my wife was expecting our oldest boy I had to tell my CO and request paternity leave and Annual leave with a rolling start date. My wife then phoned in when she went into labour and I was released from duty.|`|2isbOuRhaa	theres nothing set that he definitely gets leave time. that will be totally up to his command, and there's nothing either of you can do if they say he has to stay. however, if he does get leave time, they will take it out of the days he has saved up. therefore, if he has no days saved up, he wont be coming home. unless there's an emergency, then they usually make exceptions. you may want to have him ask him command also, because they told my husband he has to have at least 10 days saved to take leave, they wont accept anything less... good luck!|`|v3LnJycKaa	I know a friend of mine just had her daughter in Nov, and they allowed him home from iraq (he had to be there for a certain amount of time though) and he got to stay for 2 weeks.|`|jQDeTTVhaa	most likely no that's not considered as and emergency    edit:with my first my husband was deployed and he did not get to come home.I tried I made phone calls and still they said that he couldn't come home.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I'm not sure that it's a certain type but he should get to come home for two weeks at or around the birth. It depends on his situation where he's at.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	If I am not mistaking I think he gets 10 days to spend with you and the baby.
hJWjSWYXaa	Co-Ed party with games and music maybe at a skating rink if she/he wants. Sleep over with friends they can (for girl) do their hair, and make up, play game that are just for girls talk about boys, ext. (for boys) they can play sports outside, watch scary movies, play video games, and be boys!|`|keaeuczRaa	Depending on the party!  if it was just a regular average party DO NOT give it a theme unless they want it to have one!!!! order pizza, wings, subs or have it catered.
gM4exZNEaa	Choose Mason, not Maison.    Because maison is french for house, and french people will mispronounce it as May-Zo.    And Really, Mason isnt that difficult to figure out... most people would know that its pronounced like May-son.    Congrats :)|`|MSGixNibaa	I don't see how any sane person would pronounce Mason as Mah-son. Honestly, I would have more problems with Maison. It looks like My-son to me.   Mason is recognizable, while Maison is made-up so people will stubble over it more. Definitely stick to the traditional spelling, it's easier for everyone involved.|`|cfWCrxRpaa	I like Mason.  I don't think it looks like Mah-Son at all.  In my opinion, Maison looks more feminine, and it would be hard to spell.  Love the name by the way, one of my favorites :)|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	Maison looks like a typo and in french it means HOUSE.    Mason is fine because that is definately the way you spell it.  If you want to change the spelling try Mayson or Maeson.        hope i helped.    good luck|`|qBl07nnUaa	Mason definitely. I think the spelling of Maison looks weird.     Good name choice btw.|`|IJTcGIG7aa	I prefer Mason.    Maison is pretentious.....it's French for 'house'.|`|doLyOac0aa	None Sorry,|`|28ZCfGWIaa	Mason is commonly pronounced may-son ( at least here in the US, not sure where you're at). Maison sounds like my-son.    I'd prefer Mason.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	Mason  Maison is pronounced May-Zone and it means "house" in french.|`|a1UkVGpHaa	Mason|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Leave is Mason, everyone knows it's pronounced may-son. Look it up in the dictionary and that's how to pronounce it. Maison looks girlified, in all honesty.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	maison is more for a girl. so mason for a boy. just correct the people who mispronounce it.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	Maison would be pronounced either My-son or May-son depending on where you are located.   I tend to lean toward your sons name being pronounced My-son instead of May-son.  Don't try to make the name "unique" or "uncommon" by spelling it a certain way as it's still pronounced the same and when read off in class, he'll fall in with all the other Mason's anyhow.  As for your boyfriend's workmates, seems like they aren't very well educated or have yet to meet a Mason in the world.|`|zxwUpCasaa	his coworkers are wrong. mason is a common name and thats how its usually spelled. i personally dont think maison looks very good. mason is much better!|`|heC9aQ18aa	Not a fan at all of the name Mason but if that is the name you like then spell it the proper way Mason. Maison reminds me of the French word for house. Imagine your son going to France for some reason and having his name spelled like house. I love Andrew by the way. Beautiful classic name. I would pick Andrew over Mason but that was not the question so as I said I would pick the original spelling. In the end it will save you and your child a lot of headaches.|`|ZmU6ZNhBaa	Maison means house in french pronouced in a differenct way and i think the spelling Mason is fine for the pronouciation May-Son because before even reading the details for your question i pronouced Mason as May-Son so i think that the spelling Mason is fine because without even knowing the real pronouciation of it my first attempt was May-Son.|`|ewDKMeJkaa	i'd say mason, maison looks more girly|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	Both would be great.    I normally see Mason spelled that way as a last name    for a first name I would go with   Maison!     Great name!|`|4SKIE1C8aa	Maison is French for "house" and is technically pronounced may-ZOHN, so I'd stick with Mason. And Mason is trendy enough that it won't be mispronounced.|`|5RJRqNH8aa	mason|`|IvkNTqDMaa	Mason is much better.|`|NxNrZksXaa	they are just being silly. mason is the correct spelling for "may-son"  i don't like the alternative speeling.|`|b0cf194d51a7889f74b6caa215c4087daa	i think that Maison would be uniqe.I for one do not think that his workmates are right.But I would consider spelling it Maison cause it is unique i like it!!|`|rcnFMGIVaa	mason is better than maison.. maison sounds like food|`|2rq2v8weaa	Awww thats my little boys name!  I just looove the name Mason.  I used Connor for his middle name. "Mr. Mason Connor"  =)    Im not sure if I like "Maison"  something just doesnt seem right about it.   But I looove the name!|`|bZN4nRgUaa	Maison also means 'house' in French... and is pronounced may-zon, so that probably wouldn't help. If you really want to invent a new name, maybe Mayson...|`|Xye9cx5eaa	Your boyfriend's workmates are just being silly. I automatically read "Mason" as "May-son"...and most everybody I know does the same.   Maison also looks like "Madison" but with the "d" missing...My eyes automatically interpreted "Maison" as a girls' name for that reason.|`|n7vsfdplaa	Mason is the correct way to spell it but as parents you're welcome to change the spelling however you want. Those ppl who said it looks like Mah-son clearly are not intelligent enough to tie their own shoes.|`|vOD4Urzdaa	Mason! The other one looks a bit more girly.|`|sQYsMbQyaa	stick with mason
rnTNu6MTaa	Yes and they sound nice too !!!|`|4TNavgDuaa	Yes nice names.|`|TAufQoc7aa	Ok i will guess Jill-EE-na and mee-los?    am i right>?|`|r9gBoBLCaa	Jelena = Yell-enn-ah  Milos = My-Loss    ?|`|tQ4tCqDxaa	ye-le-na   ye - pronounced as YET without T   le - pronounced as LET without T   na - rhymes with HA, MA, PA     My-lows OR   Me - lows|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Jelena = "ye-LEH-nah"    Milos = "MEE-lohs"|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Is it "Ja-lena" and "Mi-low"?|`|0Yqjaj15aa	Glenna and Milow?
FAv1RYe6aa	Don't worry, I ran a daycare for 24 years and I can assure you this is normal. I have seen many who start out slow and are in gifted classes in school.  As long as he is babbling, I wouldn't worry, because one day he wont stop talking and your going to miss those days.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	It is a speech delay.  My son was evaluated by a speech therapist at 18 months.  Less than 8 words during the assessment qualifies with a minimum of a 25 percent delay.  Call early intervention, they will assess him, its free and they will provide free therapy.  I have been through this with all my kids and its great.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	They say 20 words by 18 months. I would talk to your Dr. about it.   I wouldn't assume that there is anything wrong becasue he is still communicating with you, but "late talkers" can be a sign of something more serious and therefore you should look into it!|`|jrVlzffeaa	I wouldn't worry, my son's 15months and he only says dada!! and babbles and talks to himself all day. My mum said I never talked properly until I was 2 and a half and all of a sudden I asked 'where daddy gone in car'!! lol Xx|`|CqqH12I8aa	most boys take longer to begin speaking than girls. my brother and cousin didn't talk for the longest time, and my youngest male cousin didn't talk until he was almost two. as long as your son does communicate his needs, he should be fine.|`|qSmCA82Aaa	My daughter is almost 17 moths and doesn't really say too much either.  She says Mama and Dada and I have heard her say Puppy a couple of times and she likes to walk around and point at things and say "That"  But just like you I understand her just fine, I wouldn't worry about.  I'm sure you've heard all kids are different.  My first daughter talked alot at that age and my niece whom is 20 months talks in complete and full sentences, so it really does vary.|`|s7ms1aU0aa	My nephew was the same way, we suggested a therapist and against his fathers will he accepted and it turned out everything was fine, he's almost 2 and talks more but still "babbles" therapist said he had no signs of a disability, some kids are just late bloomers, the way you described your child is the same way my nephew is.|`|oRBi01sbaa	Don't worry at all.  My son didn't talk until he was 22 months old.  When he started, it seemed that it was in complete sentences!  I'm convinced he was just sitting back taking it all in until then.  Your son will talk when he's ready, just be patient and keep working with him.|`|smzDDOJQaa	Sometimes this is normal however sometimes it is a sign of a greater medical issue such autism. unfortunately you will only know in time. talk to your doc if you havent already
UYAhesuvaa	I really like Jenna-Lynne & Melinda!!  not a huge fan of Deann, not sure why.. it just doesn't sound right to me..  Etta is beautiful :)    Congrats!|`|a4dN8qbFaa	Melinda|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Jenna-Lynne|`|wi6mkT30aa	Congrats on your little one on the way! I Love the names you have already my favorite one is Larissa, cute ring to it!!!       here are some more suggestions! good luck! I hope you like them!      Aaliyah (Ah-Lee-Ah)    Aalivia (Ah-Live-E-Ah)    Aalorah (Ah-Lor-Ah)    Kadence (Kay-Dence)    Kalla (Kal-La)    Kyelie (Kye-Lee)    Rayne (Rain)    Willow     Meredith    Gentry (Jen-Tree)    Justice    Karianna (Kar-Ree-On-Na)    Kye    I'Lynn (I-lynn)    Mallory    Ashra (Ash-Rah)    Kachelle (Ka-Shell)    Raelynn (Ray-Lynn)    Rayleigh    Mayleigh    Maylynn    Kar'Myne (Car-Mine not Car-Men)      HOPE these helped! =)|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Not a fan of any, really.    How about Miranda, Minerva, Cordelia, Lysandra, Livia?|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Etta is a much stronger name.  Although all of the names you picked are pretty in their own right they're not as strong as Etta.  Maybe something like Lena or Ella.|`|F44b2np9aa	I am not a big fan of deann, but I do really like Tiana. Etta and Tiana sound really nice together:)|`|twyjXSVuaa	Etta and Deann are nice but maybe if you had two daughters with two unique names it's a bit...too much. There are too many uinquely named children now. Maybe Tiana. Or Jenna-Lynne because if she wanted to she could shorten her name to Jen or Jenny.    Etta and Deann  Etta and Tiana  Etta and Jenna-Lynne      Etta iis a lovely name btw|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Not a fan of any, but either Jenna (just Jenna) or Larissa, or Tiana.  I don't like Deann at all.  Is Etta short for something?|`|heC9aQ18aa	I like Jenna-Lynne (prefer without Lynne) and I think Larissa is a good name too. I hate Tiana. It sounds like a really trashy name. No offense. Really low class. I don't really care for Deann either but it's your baby so it doesn't really matter what I think. Melinda is a nice enough name too and not used much. Definitely would choose Jenna-Lynne or Larissa though if the choice was mine to make. Wish you the best with your new baby.|`|w4EusdX3aa	Melinda & Tiana are my favorites|`|vOD4Urzdaa	Tiana, Melinda and Larissa.    Tiana is my favorite though. Congrats.
215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	We have two children, with the birth of each we have, of course, less time for "us". That is the only thing that has changed. We make the most of the time we do have for "us". We try to have "Us night out" at least twice per month. We go to dinner, see a movie or just do anything to have time to focus on us. We usually do this on a Sunday, one of our mothers keeps the kids for the afternoon and evening and we pick them up in time to take them home and give them baths and put them to bed and then we also make the most of our evening at home with each other. We never had these "dates" before our children were born, we didn't need to, it was just us two and we had all the time we wanted to spend time alone. We really didn't spend much time alone, surprisingly, before we had children. We had a busy social life and spend nearly all our free-time with friends. So having children has made us spend more time alone as we now need that "adult" time for our relationship. We are much, much closer now that we have children. Our lives have changed, not just our relationship. We grow together as a family. We are expecting out third child in July and he/she will make our family much closer, as that is how our relationship changes when we have changes like this in our lives.|`|mgLb5Yohaa	I just had my first, Meli, 3 months ago, and I feel as though I had a 2nd child! My husband, at times, appears to be another child in the house rather than my equal! I love'em with all I've got, but I can hardly take a shower without him coming in the bathroom with the baby and asking..."why do you think he's crying?" OMG!     We're still best friends, more friends than anything! I appreciate our friendship, hugging, watching our fav shows versus going out to the movies...our outlook has completely changed since our dating days!     I deal with the change, still, by going one day at time, and appreciating each day I'm blessed to see my hubby, and new baby boy, all of us together!|`|o23hIdOvaa	Ours changed for the better  my husband instantly became more attractive to me. The way he took care of both me and our daughter was beautiful, and made me fall back in love with him all over again. Since birth, she has been a delight, and we both look forward to coming home to her and each other every day. When it comes to intimacy, we may not be able to make love every night or every other night, but we still find time to give each other intimacy in more ways than just sexual. I couldnt be happier.
eU5Eth2aaa	I tested the day I was supposed to start my period and got a negative result.  So I tested again about a week later and it was positive!    The only symptoms I had other than missing my period was light cramping and fatigue.|`|qmslHwj3aa	I took it 2 days before my expected period.  I was trying to get pregnant.  My first symptom was at 7 weeks..I got nausea|`|dgM66nRBaa	I had the feeling... I tested a week before my expected period was due and it came out a faint positive... I tested 3 more times, they came out positive. Then went to the dr.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I waited 12 days. I was nausea's, cramping, light spotting, back pain, tender breast and headaches.|`|PYySLOw6aa	I tested the day MY period was going to start and I got a positive and my first sign was cramping!|`|pR4nLjyRaa	I tested 3 days BEFORE my missed period.  We were TTC though so I was testing like crazy! :)  I didn't have any symptoms until I was about 5 weeks.  Breast tenderness and morning sickness were my first ones.|`|KdqaGnlwaa	I tested as soon as I realized my period was late.  My period is NEVER late, so when I noticed it was 3 days late, I took a test, but it came out negative.  A few days later I retested and I got a positive. Soon after that I started having symptoms. No morning sickness, thank God!! Just some nausea, tiredness, and sore breasts. I still have sore breasts, but its more like sore nipples now, the are very tender.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	I tested the day my period was due. I didn't have any symptoms (other than a missed period) until I was 6 weeks pregnant.|`|F2cVt5jaaa	I found out I was prego when I was only 1 week!!!! I tested to early to even have any symptoms...but weeks later I was nauseous all the time boobs hurt...the regular :)|`|xRREAemFaa	first pregnancy i waited  7 days  and my second i took the test the day after i was late so on day 29  didn't start having symptom until  3 to 4 weeks after|`|rXMSK2B6aa	I took a test at about 2 weeks after my missed period but it came back as a negative so I waited a little longer about 3 more weeks and it still hadn't come so I took another test and sure enough this time it was a positive, I actually took 3 tests that day just to make sure I wasn't seeing things hehe.  I also didn't have any symptoms the first time I tested but before I tested for the second time I had sore breasts.|`|kprKXEOSaa	You can test the day of a missed period, and some pregnancy tests say you can get results up to 5 days before that.  The chances that you would get an accurate result are obviously better if you wait until your period is late, as the hormone levels rise daily.    The first symptoms for me have been nausea, fatigue and sore breasts.|`|iwYu32N2aa	I waited a whole month after my missed period to test. And a missed period was the only pregnancy symptom that I ever had.|`|UtOVEzG3aa	how many times i already read this question today?? i found out 2 days after i missed my period that i was pregnant, first symptom didn't appear until 7 weeks of my pregnancy, it was morning sickness, i had to deal with it until the beginning of my second trimaster! if you think you pregnant, and missed your period, then take a test and see!|`|0RFUKkBLaa	I waited nearly two weeks before i took a test. The symptoms before i even knew i was pregnant was sore breasts, that was about the only one and after that came the tiredness.|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	My first symptom is always cravings. With my first I had a craving for arby's that got more elaborate as the days went on (started out with just a reg. roast beef sandwich, then a medium, then a medium and a milkshake, then I started mixing different sauces together and dipping the sandwich in it). I always have breast tenderness before my period is due.    Both times I have tested early, 2 days early the first and 4 days early with the second.|`|TljXiSNnaa	I waited about 7 days before i tested. i already kinda knew though. i was really tired.....and i would beleive that my first symptom was i was sitting in the car and someone brought in a paper bag and i got sooooo nauseae that i puked lol!!! im 11 weeks now and my sickness has pretty much subsided. but besides that my breast were extremly sore!!!|`|ddP3klT3aa	A few days. I think. About 3 days. I was hungry. That was my only symptom.
rl1IITqRaa	My doc told me it takes about 3 months until you're totally safe|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	Depends on which pill you use, but it is at least 1 pack before you are safe!|`|ehvzQRkkaa	7 days of taking your pill properly it becomes effective, however don't forget it is only 99% effective and many women still can become pregnant on the pill|`|ME62Mtv4aa	I'd say wait at least 2 or 3 packs first just to be totally safe.|`|akB0gV20aa	I would start the back at the very least a month ahead of time.|`|EZcBe3C8aa	I would start taking your birth control pills now so they can get in your system. i'm not sure how many packs you have to take.

o9nSygbEaa	As hard as it is to hear it, if the baby is staying put, there's not a lot you can do that will affect it (within reason). Turning or lifting or walking or stretching or having sex or goofing off or whatever is fine and healthy while pregnant. Miscarriages happen, generally, not because of something you did or didn't do but, in most cases, in spite of everything mom tried to do to be healthy. Take you vitamins (a regular women multi-vitamin is ok), eat healthy, rest when you can but also stay moderately active (unless advised otherwise by your doctor). Do'nt drink, don't smoke, don't do drugs (duh). Other then that, there's not much you can do.     When I was pregnant with my twins I had a very physical job working nights and my doctor was fine with that. He said eventually I'd have to stop lifting as much as I usually did but that I would be fine up to like 27 weeks. I ended up delivering early, at 28 weeks, which had nothing to do with my job or activity level and everything to do with the fact that i was carrying twins. This pregnancy everything has been as "textbook" as it could get and I'm now 28 weeks and show no signs of early labor. With the twins, my cervix was already "funneling" at 22 weeks. This time it's perfectly normal.     Every pregnancy is different. Don't stress because that is about the worse thing you can do for yourself and baby. Enjoy your pregnancy and listen to your body as far as what you should and shouldn't be doing, activity wise.|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Stress is the worst thing for you right now! Relax and rest!   Also eating healthy and taking your vitamins will help a lot   Try to avoid caffeine, aspartame, smoking, and drinking!
ROJans2Taa	from about 5 weeks till 11 weeks I spotted/bled with cramps, my son is almost 5mths now, as long as the bleeding doesn't get heavy with clots, I wouldn't worry, a tiny tear outside the uterine wall can cause bleeding, it's hard to detect on ultrasound, and it heals itself, no ones sure how it happens,  but it wont cause any problems for you or baby, I experienced  a miscarriage 4 mths before conceiving again and I know that scared feeling, miscarriage after 12 weeks is pretty rare, I believe it's only 1-2% chance, best luck|`|G5Ut9prSaa	Well, I would go see your doctor, whether you can call him or not. Or go back to the ER just to be safe. Spotting during pregnancy is always something you want to get checked out, even if it may be nothing.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	You shouldn't be. I have been spotting and bleeding since I found out I was pregnant now I am almost 9 wks and I was put on bed rest. I have my 2 kids to take care of but I do my best. Keep your feet up and lay down as much as you can. The docs say I have what they call a "threatening miscarriage" ( they are just signs of a miscarriage) but the baby is healthy.|`|K542Db29aa	first stop stressing that will make matters worse, its normal later in the pregnancy at 14weeks i would call the doctor i know you have no phone.. try looking online if its normal parenting.com, google, ask.com  pregnancy.com    but you really need to take a breather and relax so you don't stress the baby and more chance of miscarriage, take a rest sit down with your feet up, stay calm...when is your next doctor visit??     write on the calender when you spotted take it to the doctor and show them the days it happened and how often.... good luck|`|dDVAUA9saa	Why are you at home, pregnant, with a child, with no access to a phone or vehicle???  But you have computer access????    Spotting CAN be normal during pregnancy, but can also be a sign that there is something going on that needs medical attention or observation.  You really need to find a phone and call a doctor.|`|wQSsw8QHaa	http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnan... there is a lot more to read at the website  What are common reasons for bleeding in the first half of pregnancy?  Since bleeding that occurs in the first half of pregnancy is so common (20-30%), many wonder what the causes are besides some of the complications already mentioned. Bleeding can occur in early pregnancy due to the following factors, aside from the above mentioned complications:    Implantation bleeding can occur anywhere from 6-12 days after possible conception. Every woman will experience implantation bleeding differentlysome will lightly spot for a few hours, while others may have some light spotting for a couple of days.   Some type of infection in the pelvic cavity or urinary tract may cause bleeding.   After intercourse some women may bleed because the cervix is very tender and sensitive. You should discontinue intercourse until you have been seen by your doctor. This is to prevent any further irritationhaving normal sexual intercourse does not cause a miscarriage.   Second Half of Pregnancy:  Common conditions of minor bleeding include an inflamed cervix or growths on the cervix. Late bleeding may pose a threat to the health of the woman or the fetus. Contact your health care provider if you experience any type of bleeding in the second or third trimester of your pregnancy.    Placental Abruption:    Vaginal bleeding may be caused by the placenta detaching from the uterine wall before or during labor. Only 1% of pregnant women have this problem, and it usually occurs during the last 12 weeks of pregnancy.    Signs of Placental Abruption:    Bleeding   Stomach pain   Women who are at higher risks for this condition include:    Having already had children   Are age 35 or older   Have had abruption before   Have sickle cell anemia   High blood pressure   Trauma or injuries to the stomach

The first names are all nice but its the Kim that seems odd.  If its a middle name I'd consider using Kimberly instead and putting it first...like Kimberly Juliet.  If its a last name then you'll need a good middle name to tie it together...I think anything with a C or K will being it in together...like Elise Christina Kim|`|twyjXSVuaa	I think Alison Kim or Juliet Kim     Also    Chloe Kin  Jasmine Kim  Christinie Kim|`|0uhRgfcsaa	alison :)|`|XralQ7CXaa	I love Elise and Isabella, the middle name Kim not so sure about. Are you naming her after someone that's named Kim?  Kimmy Elise sounds good. Out of the four though I would have to say Isabella Kim. Hope this helps! :)|`|xrJqmRFqaa	I like Isabella Kim best.  Alison Kim is nice too.|`|UVhCCgcHaa	Elise Kim|`|705dbe30dde9b45b3c57171f93776b70aa	None of them..... find some other names..|`|08d8e4d52f5338ea25059bf9c2474615aa	Juliet Kim .. nick name Jiki|`|zdpp7cubaa	Elise Kimberly or Isabella Kimberly|`|UCkkrhdhaa	I don't like any of them with the middle name Kim.  I think Juliet Elise or Alison Elise would be cute though.
omegLbOAaa	Maryellen Kim|`|uGFzzLYWaa	I like Natalie, Maria, and Elizabeth.     No middle name?   My friend had a daughter, the girl is 19 now. She didn't have a middle name, and it really bothered her that she had no middle name, and my friend had no reason for not giving her one.   So, the girl actually changed her first name, which she hated anyway and gave herself her grandmother's middle name.     Do what you want, but I thought I'd put it out there for you to consider.   Middle names can be important to have.|`|UVhCCgcHaa	Daniel    Nikko    Timothy    Elise    Essabelle    Nikki|`|UF1obD42aa	Do you have a preference of a unique or more traditional name?

zc9ZhoMIaa	Every baby is differnet! My first child slept through the night at 6 months.   I have an 8 month old now and she has slept through the night maybe 2 times.    When she was first born, she would wake every 3 hours. Now she only wakes one time a night. She is even eating cereal in her bottle ( to help with acid reflux) and eating pureed foods. But still no sleeping all the way throught the night!   Just be ready for change! You geting a full nights sleep will be your last priority! LOL  But it is all sooooo worth it! :)|`|q8bJzyUaaa	you're not wrong|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Your baby will be sleeping through at 4 months if you are lucky. My 10 month old is still up 3-7 times a night and I know plenty of other moms dealing with the same. If babies typically slept through the night at 4 months I don't think there would be so many books out there on sleeping methods.     When people tell you to sleep when the baby sleeps it's 100% true. Be prepared to feel like you are sleeping all day because you have to and nothing around the house will get done. It's normal to be up every 2-3 hours and even more the first week or two. My son was up every 2hrs at birth. He would wake, eat, need a diaper change, that would take an hour, then we would sleep for 1.5-2hrs and do it all over again.     There is no way to be fully prepared other than to not expect it to end at a certain age because it might not. You could get really lucky and have one of those babies that sleep at 4wks or you could have one like mine. Keep in mind that both are perfectly normal.|`|SDjrojZXaa	a lot depends on the weight of your child...the more your child weighs the longer they can go without eating...usually the first at least 2 months is a lot of every 2-3 hour feedings until they reach about 13lbs or so then they can go longer. my son started sleeping through the night about 3 months though.with the exception of re-binking.|`|g5RS83paaa	all babies are different, my babies slept really well the first couple months, maybe getting up once a night. The pacifier was a must and I always had an extra one right by the crib. I've heard when you breastfeed they need to feed more frequently, some women who breastfeed supplement with a bottle of formula at night|`|vue9NOhYaa	All babies are different.  But no baby should 'cry throughout the night.' If baby cries at night, it means he needs something, and you get up and offer whatever is needed. (Which will usually be food.) Once his needs are met, baby should go back to sleep for a few more hours.    As for when baby sleeps all night without waking for food -- that varies enormously, and depends on how you're defining 'sleeping the night' and your particular baby.  Most babies begin to go one longish stretch (4-6 hours) by 3-4 months or so. And that's the medical definition of 'sleeping the night.'  But some sleep through earlier, and some need to eat every 2-3 hours at night for much of the first year.      My daughter woke every 2-3 hours for the first 5 weeks or so.  Then she began sleeping 4-5 hours (I put her to bed around 11, and she woke for one feed at 2 or 3, and then slept until morning), and continued that pattern until 7 months, when she began sleeping through MY sleep hours (from around 10-11 to 6-7.)     Please do listen to YOUR baby. You may read books (or your doctor may even claim) that baby 'doesn't need to eat at night' once he reaches some specific weight or age or 'has doubled his birthweight.'  But your baby hasn't read the books, and doesn't know what he's 'supposed to' be doing.  He just knows that he's hungry.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well, they don't necessarily cry all night.  When they are just born they wake up every 2-3 hours to be fed.  Around about 3 months (and for some lucky moms, earlier) they often start having a longer stretch of sleep, like 5 or 6 hours.  But my son still woke up for one middle of the night feeding until he was around 6 months.  Honestly, by the time you've reached that point, getting up once a night doesn't really feel like that big a deal.|`|oUV9ZUsEaa	OH yeah.  be prepared for a serious change around the house. it'll be no sleep for you.    sorry :(  xoxo back,  Sylvia|`|ddP3klT3aa	All babies are different. Some babies never sleep through the night. My son started sleeping through the night at about 3 months I think. Don't co sleep and he will do a lot better as he gets older. I always put the bassinet beside me and placed him in there. He went to his crib at 4 months and did very well. Since he was home he slept 4 hours straight. Now he sleeps at least 10 hours straight. My boss' daughter is 10 months old and still won't sleep through the night.|`|XOtOMncwaa	My son didn't sleep through the night until he was 10 months old. And before then he got up on an average of 3-4 times a night... however right after he was born he never got up less than 6 times a night! After about 2 months he narrowed it down to 4 times a night, and just kept getting up less and less... he sleeps though the night now, but on occasion he still gets up maybe once. (he's a year old) Just sleep now while you can! And seriously when your baby is born sleep when they sleep... as hard as it is, try to do it... Good luck to you! and cherish them while their little!|`|DxbaEPbUaa	babies usually wake up every 3-4 hours for a feeding and diaper change. by the time they are 4-5 months old most of them will begin sleeping through the night, unless of course, they start teething which is a whole other issue. lol!!|`|TBNaPkl6aa	Really, it depends on your baby.  I was up every 3-4 hours the first month, and then after that, my daughter was able to go 5-6 hour stretches or longer without waking up.  She rarely cried when she woke up, but she mostly fussed.  By the time she was about 4 months old, she was sleeping 8-10 hours a night and continues to do so now (she's almost 8 months old).  The only time she wakes up is if her stomach bothers her, since being on some solids has messed with her system.  I'm lucky though!    Congratulations on the baby!  Don't worry about getting up a lot, you'll get used to it, or maybe you'll get a good sleeper like I did.  :)  When I was up with my daughter a lot, I found the middle of the night, when she was eating peacefully, was a great time to just relax and think about different things.  I know that sounds kind of nuts, but I sort of miss the days when my daughter was so young and could just eat and fall back asleep.  It was rewarding to be able to gaze at such a lovely creature in the middle of the night too.  You'll find positives to it, even if you're up a lot.  :)|`|rDsKB0uXaa	babys cry|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Every baby is different.  My daughter has never been much of a crier, even when a newborn.  She got up every 3-4 hours as a newborn and progressed to sleeping about 9 hours through at 3 months.  Then around 5 months she starting waking up more frequently again.  Then teething came and she was getting up every hour or two.  Now at 10 months she gets up anywhere from 3-8 times in a 12 hour period.    But, that is my baby - your baby may very well sleep through at 4,5,6 months - you never know.    Just be prepared that sleeping through the night (6-8 hours) is the exception, not the norm before age 1.  Many toddlers do not sleep through the night - I know I didn't even STTN pre baby....  Also, their sleep schedules change throughout the first year, do not think that because he/she has STTN before that they aren't now waking for a reason and need to eat or need a cuddle etc.|`|87DaOGDIaa	they will cry so good luck!|`|HVEbYuFmaa	Well its not for daddies I pissed off when my missus sprogged.|`|CHPuw61Uaa	I was under the impression that babies were just as variable as adults in their behavior. I have a little second cousin that was born a couple months ago, and he's amazingly quiet. He cries sometimes, but I can't imagine him screaming through the night.|`|jWFeb8jiaa	depends on the baby. By the time my daughter was 2 months old she was sleeping straight through from 11pm to 7-8am. My son took about another month to sleep through the night, but when he did it was from about 9pm to 6am. Try and get the baby on a good day schedule by the time he/she is 3 months old and you'll find that he/she will be more likely to sleep through the night.  Also, try and teach your baby to fall asleep on his/her own. Put him/her down in the crib when they are drowsy but not yet asleep. This will teach them to fall back asleep on their own when they do wake up...unless they're hungry and then they'll cry anyway. I know of other parents who always rocked their kids to sleep and then the baby could never soothe themselves when they awoke at other times.    good luck! and remember that's what daytime naps are for too! When they sleep....you sleep. the dishes/shower can wait :)|`|ox6SXta4aa	I think you might find a better answer if you ask your mom how you were as a baby and the daddy's mom how he was.  Not too strangely enough - they tend to take after the both of you! lol.  Typically however some babies sleep from the first night home for 6 hours or more ( I had one of these) and some of them NEVER sleep more than a couple at a time for the first maybe two months ( unfortunately had one of these too ).|`|BO28Mn8haa	it depends on the baby. i've seen babies that are wonderful and by lights out they are sleeping, wake up once in the night, then sleep till morning. i've seen other babies that cry all night long as long as possible. while pregnant, try setting up a routine for yourself in which you sleep at around 10pm, wake up 8am. maybe you're baby will pick up on the quiet time routine in the belly and adapt the behavior. just a radical idea.|`|WvUP7eJFaa	Every baby keeps their own schedule. Most do like to be awake at night. At first they sleep a lot so you will get up a few times a night but not for long. after a month or so the baby will get a schedule (if you are consistent with the times) and you can nap when the baby does so you get your rest to. When you put your baby on cereal make it the last (late dinner time) bottle at night, and the baby will sleep better. You just need to wait until the baby is old enough for cereal. Congrats on your baby!!!|`|838a01bb0df6225499d20e0502eaf376aa	First: Congrats! Second: All babies are different. My oldest was sleeping through the night (7 to 8 hours) at 2 weeks old. My youngest didn't sleep through the night until he was a year old. Breastfed babies tend to need to be fed more often, but since breastfeeding is so good for your baby, it's worth it (plus the milk is already warm, no wasting time warming bottles! Faster feeding so everyone gets to go back to sleep faster)    If you are fortunate enough to stay at home with the baby for a while it is important to remember to rest when the baby rests. During the day when baby sleeps, take a nap. There are no laws that say you have to be superwoman and catch up on cleaning, etc. when the baby sleeps. Taking care of yourself will allow you to enjoy your baby more and will make the bonding process enjoyable for both of you. If you're tired, you can get frustrated more easily and it won't be as rewarding.|`|rIOD8tgvaa	It typically does but, guess what?  Not all kids follow this norm.  Sometimes it depends on their temperament.  Other times you may face a baby that is ADD or has a problem that manifests itself later but, the sleep pattern is the first signal that something is different about this child.  I honestly did not sleep through the night for about 2 years.  My first child was one challenged by ADD.  When my second child was born I honestly slept better than I had in years.  She slept through the night but, honestly she also entertained her brother as well.  They both tired each other.  Such a blessing!  He was the type of child that provided all the right routines he slept little and it is true to this day.  He is 19 and he requires far less sleep than anyone else in the family.  I think it is important to have new moms be aware of kids with problems that effect sleep patterns.  They are not alone and it is real and there is little you can do.  We had the most structured sleeping rituals and were very informed.  It not not change his nature.  Good luck and blessings.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	This is entirely dependent on the child.  My daughter, at 6 months, gets up 1-2 times a night while my friend's son, at 6 months, has been sleeping from 8-8 since 10 weeks.  I don't believe in crying it out, so I get up with my daughter when she gets up.  It all depends on your child and how you want to handle the sleep.  Until they're 4 months, though, it's probably too hard to get them on a schedule, which is why they say around 4 months is when they start sleeping through the night.|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	I agree it's good to be prepared for some sleepless nights! It's so luck of the draw, some children completely have their days and nights mixed up, some just don't sleep, but some start sleeping through the night almost from the start.   My son started sleeping 8 hour stretches (from 10pm-6am) at 6 1/2 weeks (most nights, not all), and then was sleeping 9 hours by 2 months. Some nights he'd sleep straight through, but others he'd just wake up for a 5 minute bottle and would be out again instantly. At 4 months we stopped giving him his 1 middle of the night bottle though and he started sleeping straight from 9pm-8:30am. His schedule stayed like that for a while, and then we gradually moved his bedtime up to a 7:30/8pm-6:30/7am schedule. Now at 16 months his night time schedule's been pretty solid at 8pm-7:30/8am.   I'd say on average, newborns get up every 2-3 hours at night for a feeding. As long as you're prepared for the worst... you might end up pleasantly surprised :-)
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey i am so sorry for your losses    These signs certainly do sound like pregnancy symptoms, i had exactly the same early on in my first pregnancy with the nausea, tiredness and cramps.  With me my body took a little longer to produce high hcg levels, and therefore i didn't get a positive until i was 5 weeks pregnant.  I knew in myself that i was pregnant, that's why i didn't give up testing it took me 8 negatives before i saw my BFP!!  Unfortunately that's pregnancy ended at 34 weeks and my son was a stillborn, we are ttc again and im having all my symptoms coming back so am hoping i will be getting my BFP again soon but am going to leave it a little while because of last time.    Good luck tomorrow, is it a blood test? These are alot more accurate and detect low hcg levels that a home kit can't.  Let me know how you get on :)    Best of luck xxx|`|xpstigPTaa	let us know how the blood test comes out because you def sound like your pregnant, without a doubt. Keep us posted and good luck to you! Baby dust!!!|`|zWX5GDehaa	those are alot of signs to being pregnant id get checked out again!!|`|OH0JHlxsaa	You could be - the syptoms all point to it.  Some times a woman's body won't produce enough of the hormone (hCG) that the urine sticks read to get a "positive" pregnancy test.  Either blood tests are required or you may need to wait a week or so later to test again with your urine.  Good luck.

0sJsTN83aa	With this scenario it sounds like the man and woman are not together and/or do not often interact.  If that is the case the rights vary a lot by state.    In most cases you have to register on the punitive father's registry if you even suspect that someone is pregnant with your DNA.  If you don't do this, and don't sign the birth certificate, it is very possible that you will not be informed or involved in any decisions unless you push for a DNA test.      If you have little to no contact with the mother, she could say there is no father and do whatever she wants.  The man in this case has to be serious and diligent, and not wait for the woman to tell him what to do or when.      In some states, if you are not on the birth certificate, or the mother is very determined to go the adoption route, you may take your child, but only after proving that you (yourself, not your parents) can financially, emotionally, and physically support the baby, otherwise the baby will go into foster care until these things can be provided by you alone.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	He would need to prove he is the father. DNA.  He would be smart to get a lawyer.  If he is proven to be the father, he has the right to raise his baby.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	Actually the father would have rights when it comes to adoption.  When my husband and I adopted our son- his birth mom had last contact with the father, however, the attorney did everything that he could to get in touch with him, so that there would be no problems later if the father came back into the picture.  If the father wants to raise the child, and has a way to do it, yes, he could legally raise that child.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	if the dad wants the baby and the mom doesn't, dad will get the baby. he will just have to do a little fighting in the courts to get it done. a woman can try to put the kid up for adoption, but if a man comes and says 'thats my kid. im not ok with adoption.' a DNA test will be given and dad will be given custody.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Technically the father has as much right to raise the child as the mother does, regardless of any support or not from his parents.  Where the issue gets sticky is if she places the child for adoption stating she does not know who the father is and nobody takes steps to identify him.  The system is supposed to do so or time must be taken in a process to declare in court that they can't find him but if the father catches wind of the fact that the mother is trying to place the child for adoption without his consent then he can stop the process.  He may have to go through a DNA process to prove paternity but it's possible and it's been done, lots.  Unfortunately, biological fathers have also slipped through the cracks as well and been left either high and dry or struggling for years to regain custody or at least some contact.|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	The father could legally petition the courts to establish paternity.  If paternity proves he is the father and the mother wants to give the baby up for adoption, legally he'd have first choice.  But it's very important tomove quickly.|`|cd962e52b53659b6dacb1df7cbdf7a87aa	i read of a case in the paper in florida where a teen age father got his baby.|`|5Crovdoaaa	He does have rights. He'd need to hire a lawyer and get a DNA test done. If she would be in the process of adopting the baby out, they'd have to go to court to get an injuction stopping the process. After the DNA results came back, they would then have to go to court for custody. The fact that she wants to give the baby up, and assuming the father has a stable life in ALL areas, more than likely the father would get custody.|`|YzwuDRfYaa	Legally, the father most certainly does have rights.  He only needs to prove (via DNA) that he is the father.      Since the mother intends to put the child up for adoption, why should she not want the father to "adopt" ?|`|iVcaB9h7aa	Absolutely.  In order for a child to be placed for adoption, the parental rights of both the mother AND father need to be terminated (either voluntarily or involuntarily).   If the father can provide a good, stable home he definitely has the right to parent his own child.    I live in Illinois and a DNA test is NOT required to establish paternity.  Here's our law:    A man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if:    He and the child's mother are or have been married to each other, even though the marriage is or could be declared invalid, and the child is born or conceived during such marriage.  After the child's birth, he and the child's mother have married each other, even though the marriage is or could be declared invalid, and he is named, with his written consent, as the child's father on the child's birth certificate.  He and the child's mother have signed an acknowledgment of paternity.  He and the child's mother have signed an acknowledgment of parentage or, if the natural father is someone other than one presumed to be the father, an acknowledgment of parentage and denial of paternity in accordance with Ch. 410,  535/12.

It would probably be advisable as a first step to enjoin the wife from getting an abortion - just in case things get disagreeable.|`|7aCH91ISaa	Many states have a putative fathers registry and if someone *thinks* you might be the father of a child you must register or you will lose your rights to your child.     "The Putative Father Registry records the names and addresses of fathers (or men who believe they are fathers) of children born outside of marriage.    Why should a father put his name on the Putative Father Registry? The Putative Father Registry allows a man to officially claim he is the father of a child. A man may want to do this before paternity is legally established if he cant find the childs mother or if the mother doesnt want to establish paternity for the child.    The Putative Father Registry is used in adoption proceedings to identify the childs father, and promptly secure his consent to proceed with the adoption. A man who is concerned that his child may be adopted without his consent should place his name on the Putative Father Registry before the childs birth or within 15 days of the childs birth in order to be notified of an adoption proceeding for the child. Failure to file in a timely manner shall waive a mans right to withhold consent to an adoption preceding unless:  The person was led to believe through the mothers misrepresentation or fraud that:  ? The mother was not pregnant when in fact she was; or  ? The pregnancy was terminated when in fact the baby was born; or  ? After the birth, the child died when in fact the child is alive; and  The person upon the discovery of the misrepresentation or fraud satisfied the requirements within 15 days of that discovery"|`|P2yRAWiJaa	The father has every right to the baby.  If the mother terminates her rights, the father is next in line to take care of the baby.  As long as she agrees he is the father that is.  If there is any doubt then there will need to be a paternity test to determine he is the father.  Once that is established and his name is on the birth certificate he can raise the child.  He has to be asked before she puts him up for adoption otherwise what she does isn't legal.|`|wi6mkT30aa	Absolutely! This is the child's FATHER after all! Of course he has the right to raise this child and take care of it just as much as the mother does. I truly think it gets over looked though, I've see many cases where the mother doesn't want the child and give sit up for adoption without even ASKING the father if he wants to take custody, it's sad.|`|BlMfOIBCaa	If you are the true father which can be determined by a DNA test you have the same and equal rights as the mother just beacuse the mother birthed her doesn't give her all authority of the child.

T9fek24eaa	Oh honey. That book has good intentions but it is absolutely the worst thing to read during pregnancy. I did this my first pregnancy too. I remember sitting out on my porch reading the part of what could go wrong and by the time I was done reading I had pre-eclampsia, HELLP, gestational diabetes and everything else that was in there, or at least I thought.     I have never heard of a baby having hiccups and cord issues being linked together. My daughter had hiccups alot and she came out perfectly normal. If you are that worried, ask your doctor about it at your next appointment. He will probably tell you that the odds of that happening and the baby having hiccups as a sign is a million to one and you have nothing to worry about.     Calm down and dont read that part of the book. I know its hard and you want to know everything about pregnancy and what to watch for, but some things are best not known.|`|v3LnJycKaa	my last daughter was the worst, she had the hiccups from about 18 weeks on, 5 6 7 sometimes upwards of 10 times a day and they never lasted less than 15-20 minutes, all ultrasounds were fine, she was born with the cord 3 times around her neck but the dr said it was due to the way she came down the birth canal, she corkscrewed all the way up... but she is a healthy happy almost 10 month old, smart as a whip... i wouldnt worry too much|`|iwYu32N2aa	Well its says that "the cord MAY be wrapped, and COULD have knots. Meaning that just because your baby hiccups doesnt mean anything. if are are concerned about this ask your doc to check it out. Good Luck|`|jQDeTTVhaa	I don't let things like that worry me in the words of my doctor everything you read may be taken out of context.my daughter also has hiccups everyday seems like it and they last a long time.I am now 40wks today and she is doing pretty good.|`|UtOVEzG3aa	you need to stop reading, sometimes too much info is not good, if you coceder call your doctor, good luck|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I have never heard of that before!

All my babies had hiccups, off and on all day since the time I could feel them.   My Dr also never asked me if I could feel the baby/babies having hiccups. You could reason that if the Dr isn't asking frequently, like at every visit in the end, that it's not a huge risk.|`|winmjHAmaa	Call your doctor and ease your mind.  Better to be safe than sorry!  I wouldn't hestiate to give them a call.  It's so worth it.|`|hamdnq5Yaa	Yes it is true about the umbilical cord.  I would just make sure that you feel the baby move every hour or so.  My daughter had the hiccup all the time and I never had any problems with the cord.  You just have to relax you can't try to  control things that you have no control over.. Just make sure that you feel the baby moving around.  If you are sick over it maybe your doctor can give you a sono to see what the position of the baby is.|`|NSHZUQyOaa	hi i read the same bit in the book!!!! Got me really worried as well cos my baby has hiccups at least twice a day and sometimes they go on for ages and are really strong. I mentioned my worries to the midwife and she said its very rare that the baby would have hiccups from the cord being where it shouldn't and 90% of the time its just from practicing to breathe. I would try not to worry and see the hiccups as a sign ur little one is practicing to breathe and not that anything is wrong.|`|F2cVt5jaaa	My baby girl hiccuped all the time..I'm serious all the time...she was fine..it was just uncomfortable cuz her head was jammed in my pelvic area..sdo i felt every hiccup..lol...i miss that...ddont worry about it!! You don't have much longer to go...just sit back and enjoy these last moments of your baby inside you :)|`|xH3cIAuxaa	I've never heard of that before, and when I was pregnant my daughter had frequent hiccups and she is fine...you know what, I've never read What to Expect before but everyone I know has been scared by it in one way or another...I think maybe you should put the book down and discuss any concerns with your doctor instead...this book just gives you a million things to worry about, which you don't need!|`|XZxNQSlVaa	My mom said I had hiccups all the time when she was pregnant with me and the cord was not wrapped around my neck when I was born.    My son never had hiccups and when he was born the cord was wrapped around him 3 times to the point they almost had to do an emergency c-section.     I would ask your doctor, but I would not worry.|`|pR4nLjyRaa	My son had hiccups all the time when I was pregnant with him, he came out just fine, no complications, the cord wasn't around his neck and he even had the hiccups for about a week after he was born too!  Try not to worry but if you really feel something is wrong don't hesitate to give your doctor a call! Good luck!|`|XO4talxxaa	Don't stress your self out! Calm down, when my sister was preggo with my niece, she got hiccups like 4 times a day and they would last like 15 minutes and my niece is perfect! Don't believe everything you read, remember everyone is different! :) My sister thought it was kind of neat to feel her baby have hiccups in the womb! lol|`|dKQ5oDo9aa	When I was pregnant with my daughter, she CONSTANTLY had hiccups. She was born without any problems and still gets hiccups once a day usually haha    I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.|`|R9mQNOCnaa	That book was designed to give you the worst case.Most woman do go nuts after reading that.If you're not sure,call your doctor.I don't know how you can tell when the baby has hiccups but I would just relax and put that book down.Pray for a healthy baby and when in dougt call the dr Good luck.|`|qpbV2VyJaa	haha. my son had the hiccups all the time inutero. he was born with the cord around his neck. but they just had me stop pushing and slid it over his head. he was completely fine though. if something was wrong you would most likely know. you wouldn't feel him move or anything like that.. babies are born with the cords around their necks all the time. it's not a very big deal... as long as you've got drs. there.   god I hated that book. it made me so friggen paranoid. there's so many things that can go wrong and they list them all... I was sure that there was going to be something horribly wrong with my son because it seemed like there was no way that he could be normal with all the problems there COULD be. but the chances are really low. don't worry so much!
CuCrGDuRaa	No, my doctor told me they are caused by a combination of the pregnancy hormones and an increase blood flow, neither of which you can do anything about.  My nose usually bleeds just a little when I am vomiting.|`|2B2fgmw9aa	no solution so far....They do say humidifiers, which haven't worked for me, and saline nose drops, which are disgusting.....Basically you just gotta deal with it!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I had this problem a bit while pregnant.  I never found a solution, I just dealt with it.|`|kprKXEOSaa	It feels weird, but you can take a little vaseline on a q-tip and put it inside your nostrils to keep them moisturized.|`|v3LnJycKaa	i wish i wake up every mornign stuffed, as soon as I blow my nose it is like my period has shifted locations and is now coming out my nose... gross... puddles of blood.. i have tried humidifiers everything.. nothing works.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	humidifiers. or boiling water on the stove. anything to put more moisture in the air.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	hahaha to Kim I had the same thing, I'll never forget driving and I blew my nose and whoosh blood bath, I had the smallest tissue and and there was a traffic cop that stopped me so a tractor could go by and he was just staring at me with blood all over my face and nose looking like a drug addict with my 2 yr old in the back while hugely pregnant he must've been so disgusted. lmao
AA10953561	We're in a similar situation. I'm a new step-mom. My five year old step-daughter tried to not do the things that I asked her to do at first, but once she realized that I was going to be firm and not let her get away with disobeying she changed her attitude. Now she asks me how she can help me. She rarely (if ever) asks her dad what he needs help with.     The major difference between you and I is the age of the children. Teenagers are always a little more difficult. Personally, if I were you I'd probably show them why they need to start listening. They aren't going to empty out their own pockets? You're not going to wash their clothes. See how fast that one changes (my mother did this to me when I was about 12, worked like a charm!). Not going to pick up their wet towels and put them in the right place? Wash the towels any way, but ask them to pay a rental fee that they won't get back until their towels and clothes are picked up. I know it sounds ridiculous, but you'd be surprised what a kid will do to get their money back.     For the older one, threaten to take his car away if he can't respect the neighborhood. If he keeps doing it, follow through. That's the biggest thing. Follow through, stick to what you tell them, and never cave.     With my step-daughter my honey caves about half the time and I swear that's why she acts the way she does with him. She knows she can push her boundaries with him because he doesn't have them clearly defined for her, whereas she knows where my boundaries are and exactly how far I'll let her push me before she is in trouble.     Good luck!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	You could observe stepmom & see how she interacts with the kids, then try to emulate that attitude, the one that is earning her respect.      Or, you could talk to the kids & let them know that you are feeling disrespected.  I'm sure that, if they love you, they don't want to be responsible for making you feel that way.      Also, stepmom could talk to them about it, let them know that she doesn't like that they are not treating you with respect, that she expects better from them.|`|6EnQYZEOaa	Do you think they respect her more because if they don't or if they get into trouble she disciplines them and follows through or maybe they think you just ask too much all the time and it seems like you are constantly nagging if neither one rings true then sit them down for a little one on one (do not talk to them both at the same time)|`|FAv1RYe6aa	Are you a little more aggressive then she is? Sometimes its your tone of voice that gives teens an uneasy feeling. Do you ask them or tell them? There are many ways to speak to you teens.   To much nagging over little things will not get the respect you want from a teen.    If all else fails, have your wife tell them.
oVxr5B3Eaa	I'd try both days!   You might have problems with getting pregnant. I think after 2 years it's time to see a doctor, because you likely have a fertility problem.   My mom took SIX years to have my brother, but she refused to go to the doctor for any kind of help.|`|RPszYGXkaa	To add to the confusion, it is both days!   According to "taking charge of your fertility", your most fertile time are the two days prior to ovulation and the day of ovulation.    I would be sure to do the BD on one of you pre-ovulation fertile days and then try again when you suspect actual ovuation.  Our eggs only live 12 - 24 hrs, but sperm can live for up to 5 days in the right cervical fluid.  Baby dust!|`|vue9NOhYaa	If you are sure when YOU ovulate, it's best to have sex in the day or two before ovulation.  Sperm can easily live several days, but the egg lives less than a day. If you wait until the day OF ovualtion, the egg may be gone by the time the sperm complete the journey.    Still, if you've been trying for 2 years, it's time to see a doctor.  Minor differences in timing should not be keeping you from getting pregnant this long.  Odds are that there is something else wrong.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	you need to have intercourse starting a few days before you ovulate and even a few days after. you're most fertile on the day you ovulate but as sperm can live in the vagina for up to 7 days, its best to just have a bunch of sex around the time you ovulate so you know you're getting the job done.     and since you've been trying for 2 years. maybe you should check with a fertility doctor to make sure everything is ok.|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	The day before, the day of and the day after are all fertile days.  Sperm live anywhere from 3-5 days.  Just make sure you are not having intercourse too much.  If you are unsure of the fertile days get an OPK test and when it says you are in the fertile zone have intercourse every other day.  Hope this helps.  Good luck|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	i would do it 3 days before then the day before to be safe that away the sperm count can get a little back up for the next try|`|4kJrDvDYaa	2-3 days before, and the day of! sperm can survive up to 5 days so its best to have it there waiting for the egg instead of the egg waiting for the sperm!|`|cDjWONryaa	You can conceive up to 3 days after intercouse if you ovulate. Sperm can live in the Falopian tubes for up to 72 hours awaiting a egg.    Good luck.|`|NxNrZksXaa	you can actually have sex 3-4 days before you actual day of ovaltion because sperm can live inside you for 72 hours.|`|j4lcMGmiaa	its best to have intercourse on the day you are ovulating...you can get a kit to test when you are...however, I think you should just stop trying to have a baby, relax, and enjoy the moment...and before you know it you will conceive...that is if you don't have any fertility problems...I find that most of my friends that are trying take a much longer time to conceive then those who aren't trying at all.|`|KOj8XOHPaa	Actually, you can do both.  Sperm can stay in your system up to 2 days, waiting for an egg to drop.      I don't know if this will help, but I'm pregnant right now.  I told the doctor the exact date of my last period (Oct. 22nd), and he told me that I conceived approximately 2 weeks later (Nov. 5th or 6th).  Perhaps if you wait 2 weeks from the day you start, your chances will be greater for pregnancy.      . . . that, or DON'T plan to have a baby, and I'm sure it'll happen!|`|UVQrNF3daa	We try every other day starting like 3 days before ovulation.  We make it land on ovulation day and then two days after.  This month however, We tried opposite days than normal.  I also tried robitussin this cycle and af should have started monday and hasnt yet!  This is our 12th month trying!  I have never missed a period before.. i would say mix it up.. one month try on certain days and next month try on other days!  Good Luck|`|f5pticCLaa	You should do it a couple of days before and the day of...just to be sure to cover all the most fertile days :)  Good Luck and baby dust !!!|`|QFNvYVtyaa	Is there truly a best time to conceive a baby? In a typical woman's cycle, the window of opportunity for conception each month is very narrow. There are countless numbers of women who have conceived without even trying, or without knowing exactly when conception happened.     But for those of us who are actively trying, and getting to know our bodies better as a result, there is a vast amount of education to be learn regarding the best time to conceive.     An egg is released each cycle when ovulation occurs. This only happens once in a cycle. However, there are rare instances when another egg is released within 24 hours of the first egg. Given the fact that the egg will only live for 12 to 24 hours, the window of opportunity is very narrow for pregnancy to occur. It is important to time intercourse properly, to make sure that there are sperm present when an egg is released from the ovary. From this stand point, a woman has 12 to 24 hours to actually get pregnant each month. However, sperm can live up to 5 days in good, fertile-quality cervical fluid. This gives somewhat of an increase in the window of opportunity. Unless you have been charting, and know for certain that your cervical fluid is excellent fertile-quality, don't rely solely on this. To be absolutely sure of when ovulation occurs, chart your fertility signs - basal body temperature, cervical fluid and possibly cervical position|`|DKyV5CU1aa	just go for doing it every day for a month,  that might work for you.... . .|`|XyQgoSk1aa	2-3 days be4 ovulation gives you a better chance to catch the egg
a3cb80b66a772a6b621fcf095945a298aa	i was 41 and 1 when i got induced with my first daughter cuz i didnt dialate and after about 10 hours of labor i only dialated to 3 and then ended up having a c section...and i was 41 and 5 with my second daughter...i only dialted to one cm and had an other c section cuz i didnt go into labor...some woman just dont go into labor...and i am one of those woman..and you might be too..just try to relax...i know how you feel.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Well, with my previous two pregnancies, my labor just doesn't start on its own, and I've had to be induced.  I'm hoping my body will cooperate a little better this time.  I guess I should just be grateful for modern medicine, rather than feel bad I wasn't able to have the natural birth I wanted!  Edit: they say that having intercourse can help soften the cervix and get labor started.  Something in the semen...  And a nice orgasm is always good.|`|v3LnJycKaa	some women have a hard time going into labor on their own, i know with my first i did, but as soon as it started whew.. i hard true labor for maybe 3 hours... and 3 pushes she was out.|`|jQDeTTVhaa	dont feel to bad I'm 40wks now still hard and closed.I am also being induced on but on the 4th.I was 41wks 1day pregnant with my first and still hard and closed just like you.I had to be induced with him also.It sucks don't it.I guess thats just how it is for some women.
bAp35x7uaa	Yes, it's lack of blood sugar.  I've found since I've been pregnant that I become ravenous with no warning and if I don't eat immediately, I get sick.  Try and keep a bag of nuts, or fruit or digestive biscuits/crackers with you, so when you feel those pangs, you can quickly fill the gap until your next meal.      xx|`|NQ2sDQMRaa	during my pregnancy, the only time i actually felt like i was going to vomit was when i let myself get pretty hungry, so i used to carry around with me snacks in my purse, usually crackers to prevent that from happening. Congrats! and good luck!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	YES, you cannot let your stomach go on empty...drink water...some crackers or fruit. just have some snacks around.|`|W0d6NsGBaa	Yes....while pregnant its normal to feel nauseous at ANY time. Food or not.|`|r2EBoqyiaa	yeah all the time to be honest I have morning sickness in the morning and in the evening it drives me crazy but its a small price to pay x|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Yes, an empty stomach and low blood sugar actually causes you to get sick while pregnant.  It's best to eat small, frequent meals or snacks throughout the day.  Try to keep something in your stomach and it should help.|`|rt4OnxkYaa	VERY normal. fun right? lol|`|WcvsBgLuaa	Yupp, just a little bit ago.  So I made some sausage links and I feel better now :)|`|NxNrZksXaa	yeah... sucks doesn't it!|`|2B2fgmw9aa	yep! I go through it every morning when I wake up!! As soon as I eat, I feel better!!  Try keeping crackers or something with you at all times and munching on them when you feel like that. Graham crackers are awesome first thing in the morning!|`|fE5zMOfJaa	That's when you actually feel the worst!  It sucks!  I'm 12 weeks & still dealing w/ it!  I feel like I can't get enough food!  SOOOO annoying!!!|`|EEP5Z4muaa	Oh yes, it's best to have something little and often when you suffer like this, even if it's just a dry cracker or two!  Try mint tea and or mints, they help me to settle my stomach.|`|afW58le8aa	Absolutely, that is when I was the most sick.  Try to keep something in your stomach at all times.  I found that if I just had a bag of crackers by me all day and took a handful every 30 mins that it helped keep away the nausea.  A few bites of something ever 30 mins will help a lot, try to keep it healthy and you will be helping yourself and your baby.  Good Luck!|`|mn8tFuhoaa	yeap so normal!! thats how its going to be until you go into labor.
9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun! its never to early to start a prenatal vitamin again. It has iron in it that will help your anemia. Also as far as your ? goes, according to my dr spotting isn't your menses yet its just spotting. You may spot for a few days before menses so theres a point in our cycles when we KNOW we have our period thats day 1! I can't explain it but I am sure that you know what I am talking about!! Hang in there hun and Im sorry about ur ectopic. 
654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Despite some people saying there is no such thing as growing pains, our pediatrician says that YES, they are real.  Both of my boys had them, one more pronounced than the other.    Dehydration can also be an issue, when one has crampy legs.  A lack of enough calcium can also produce leg cramps, so make sure your son is getting as much milk, or yogurt, cheese, etc. to get the RDA of calcium.  IF he is lactose-intolerant, there are supplements he can be taking.    The Tylenol should help.  I know it is frustrating to have you child be in pain and not be able to do much to take him out of it.  It does pass, in time, but I know that's not much comfort.      Good luck to both of you!|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Sometimes low levels of pottassium/calcium/magnesium can cause leg cramps.  You can try taking care of it on your own by adding foods high in these to his diet or take him to the doctor and get his levels checked.|`|r9gBoBLCaa	It's been proven that growing pains don't exist, but I still don't believe it. I had SUCH bad leg pain as a kid. So bad! What else could It be?  I'm guessing tired legs. Nothing you can really do.      Norma: Can being dehydrated give you leg pain?  - This would make a lot of sense to me. Around the same age I was constipated a lot. :P|`|AA11352641	He could be getting "charlie horses" which I know I get personally from poor fitting shoes. Is he flat footed or does he have high arches? This also can be caused by dehydration. It helps to increase potassium, so you can have him eat some banana in the evening before he goes to bed. Having him sit in a warm bath or applying a heating pad will help relax the muscles. I would give him Motrin instead of Tylenol since it has an anti-inflammatory effect.|`|eFB2jLVbaa	Mild Dehydration: (increase fluid intake -- and for babies, call a medical professional): Thirst, dry lips, dry mouth, flushed skin, fatigue, irritability, headache, urine begins to darken in color, urine output decreases  bullet     Moderate Dehydration: (call a medical professional): All of the signs of mild dehydration, plus: skin doesn't bounce back quickly when pressed, very dry mouth, sunken eyes, (in infant - sunken fontanel, the soft spot on the head), output of urine will be limited and color of urine will be dark yellow, cramps, stiff and/or painful joints, severe irritability, fatigue, severe headache  bullet     Severe Dehydration: (call emergency number): All of the signs of mild and moderate dehydration, plus: blue lips, blotchy skin, confusion, lethargy, cold hands and feet, rapid breathing, rapid and weak pulse, low blood pressure, dizziness, fainting, high fever, inability to pee or cry tears, disinterest in drinking fluid      since a lot of people say it may be dehydration check this out and see if he has any of these other signs|`|AdIrjmV7aa	He probably is not drinking enough water. It sounds as though he is dehydrated.|`|oDyNiJi7aa	This could be two different things first of all make sure he is drinking enough of water and second it could be growingpains.

I think maybe you should talk to your family Dr. I sent you an email link on postpartum depression, I hope it helps or you could go to mayoclinic.com and get some answers,,,Takr care Rita|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Crying, feeling anxious, dark thoughts, inability to sleep, anxiety symptoms like chest pain and dizziness.

lgcuIFKxaa	There is hope!!! My ex wife and I planned our first baby. We went by the book went to Doc's was advised that because ex wife had been on pill for so long it would probably take a while to conceive. Not to worry just be prepared for a wait. She came off the pill the day we left to go on hols. We had a great holiday because we thought it was going to take a while my ex wife drank booze she did a bungee jump went scuba diving many activities.  Anyhow a week after we got back home she was a few days late for her period. She was like saying perhaps its mucked up because she had come off the pill  well she did a test anyway and wow bang she was pregnant. We has a lovely baby girl who is now 12.  2 years later we decided to try again. Bang 1 month later she was pregnant. she had lots of pain cramps etc with second pregnancy she was sick alot was really not well at all.  a while on Because of erratic periods we were unsure of how far gone she was so we went for a dating scan. Thats when everything went wrong. Turned out the pregnancy was ectopic. She was 14 weeks and we were advised she needed emergency surgery as obviously it was life threatening to Carry on with the pregnancy. The hospital did so many things wrong to many to list now. To cut a long story short the botched the surgery and my ex wife almost died  was in intensive care and her heart actually stopped 3 times. Turned out they  severed a major artery which resulted in her losing her right tube. her left tube turned out to be damaged had scar tissue from a previous un identified incident. To cap all this off she developed severe endometreosis sorry don't know how to spell it. We were told that our chances of conceiving  a baby were virtually nil zilch Nada nothing. She had a large cyst in a place that would also have made conception virtually impossible as-well. We decided that because of everything it was best to not even entertain the idea of more kids. decided any help was not for us. We saved hard " 2 years later had a wedding worthy of being in Hello mag went on Honeymoon to Dubai in the best hotel in the world. Guess what when we got home yes she was pregnant was conceived on honeymoon. Doctors warned that it was risky as the cyst was in a bad place could cause alot of probs if we carried on with the pregnancy. But we talked about it and decided that this little miracle deserved a chance . We were told that the only hope was that the endometreosis cyst would shrink at the same rate as the pregnancy progressed. Luckily for us it did! My son is now 8 years old and a very special little man he is too. Both my kids are special obviously. So never give up never give up at all. Please don't hold to much stock on all these medical advances. Relax and let nature take its course. I am not saying don't try all thats out there I am saying don't let this consume all your life. Good luck and God bless X :)|`|fBpZ9b9iaa	Hey there girl,  I know its hard and believe me when I say I KNOW what your going through. I feel the same with my situation. Me and my husband have been TTC for 3 years with no luck.  I feel bad that I can't give him the family he deserves.  But he is always by my side and loves me anyways.      We currently have stopped trying and we desided taking a break and focusing on us and bettering our selfs.  Im going to start going to school and we want to purchase a house.  Maybe its time to take a breather and try and focus on other things.  I have heard many women say the moment they stopped trying thats when it happend.    Now, I can't tell you to stop and you will stop.  Only YOU know when its time to take a break.  All the women around me just said stop trying and stop thinking about it.  I couldn't do that because I longed for a child so much.  It wasn't until NOW 3 years down the road we  have desided to just take a break.      Don't get me wrong we still want a baby and we are NOT preventing it by any means.  We still have unprotected sex, but we are not timing everything.  The stress with starting a family was getting to both of us and we didn't think it was healthy on our marraige.  So taking some time off is like having a well earned vaccation and its been nice.      If we get pregnant through this wonderful but if not we will try agian when we decide its time agian.  I can't tell you what to do but I can say that if you want a baby just hang in there.  Maybe try thinking about what you could to to better your relationship. Spend time together like you never have before.  Once baby comes a lot will change and I had to remind myself of that.      It will be you, your boyfriend and the baby.  Can't just skip out and go out for the day without planning.  You will have to plan just about everything.  Try to stand back and look at the big picture. Trust me, it took us a long time to see it ourselfs. We were so wrapped up in baby making we didn't really think about how much him and I were missing out on eachother.      Just think about it.  It may help you out a lot.  I don't know if its going to work but in the last 3 years I have done everything else except for stop trying.  We will see if this does the trick. Good luck to you! Hang in there! Good things come to good people!|`|RE6GBw0Baa	oh hunni.,    big hugs and lots of love.    ur baby will ocme my love, and it will be so worth the wait. i know how much it hurts and how it feels lik things will never get any better but hun u will cope and u will have a lovely baby i know it xxxxx    best wishes my lovely and please cheer up, i like happy jo lol xxxx|`|c97b62c8660b1041d9759f33d466797faa	awww, hun. i know how you feel...there is hope dear...hang in there|`|U5RObaBGaa	your get there, why don't you stop trying for a bit, you never know it may just happen when the pressure is off xx|`|IhhvG1Cnaa	Aw am so sorry so you are feeling like this hunny! But like you said, you already have a problem with 1 f tube so it may take longer. Stop worrying hunny, i think it is definately going to happen soon. I have also been ttc for 13 months and have got nothing so good luck to us both eh.    **********BABY DUST**********|`|AA12123844	I can understand your pain and despair but you have to remember STRESSING isnt make it any better, I know its easier said than done BUT RELAX, quit tripping on it and just make yourself think I HAVE GOT TO STOP STRESSING OVER THIS, I dont have one f-tube and have heard you ovulate on every other side every other month....Are you paying attention to your periods and when you are ovulating? Most women, but NOT ALL ovulate about 10 days before their next cycle is due to begin, you will notice a thick egg white like discharge the day before of and after you are ovulating, it is best to have sex those 3 days, me personally we did the baby dance every single day for the week I was expecting ovulation and BINGO we were pregnant. I know how hard it can be, a very long time ago I made a decision to terminate a preg for several factors, and was terrified I would never be given the chance again it literally killed me to see others pregnant, and for the longest time the more I stressed and hated each month was the same, i wasnt preg, but when I actually just said you know what, whats gonna happen is gonna happen and I had to force myself to not think about it and I am serious the minute I stopped stressing so did my body and here we are today 35 weeks, fat miserable peeing all the time and expecting a baby girl. Dont fret honey, good things come to those who wait, you can try the home ovulation predictor kits but again dont stress over it, just enjoy making love and do it often, they say it can deplete your mans sperm count but I talked with my doc and she said doing the do for 5 days straight is NOT gonna deplete the count and its actually a good thing to have enough sperm in you as it lives for about 72 hrs in you, so you are keeping a good 8-9 days worth of live baby makers in there! Good luck to you, And if going around prego people only upsets you THEN STOP, stress isnt good for you and isnt helping you get prego any faster!!!!! Be happy for them but be happy from a distance, you are what matters most remember that!|`|hX7zhyIoaa	hi..  im trying to and no exactlly how your feelin all the grls in work r preg and im not it gets so frustrating.. i just keep telling myself that im not trying so that when the little mirclle finally happens ill be shocked and even more excited than i would normally be.. i think that because ur HOPING 4 a miricle if you concieve and its a grl you call her hope....xx|`|LGNyapa1aa	Well, i don't have just one f-tube but i do know how you feel - i got pregnant with my son at 18 without even trying, but then when my husband and i started trying for a second child, we couldn't believe how hard it was! The worse thing for me was that i had told so many people we were TTC, so everyone would ask me all the time "are you pregnant yet" and it killed me to have to constantly say no.    Both my husband and i were doing everything "right" and according to "statistics" we should have got pregnant straight away (both in our 20's, healthy, not overweight etc) but month after month i was devastated when i came on.    Anyways, i become OBSESSED with getting pregnant and my closest friend then told me she was pregnant - i cried so much and felt so guilty that i just felt pure jealousy for her rather than being happy for her!     There is hope though, after 2 years of trying, my husband and i just decided to give up, and THAT MONTH i got pregnant - everyone says that stress makes it harder to get pregnant and they're so right, as hard as it seems, you have to give up and CHILL OUT and then you will get pregnant - stop counting the days, don't have sex just to conceive, stop using fertility tests and just enjoy life together, it WILL happen!!!!!     I am now 39 weeks and 2 days pregnant ~ there really is hope!|`|MHNFnBzgaa	hey hunni    i was on the same boat as you.  me and my other half was trying for 1 year and 5 months. and i just found out my best friend was pregnant, my sister in-law was pregnant and 2 girls from my work were pregnant i couldn't stop crying and was hurting SO much then i gave up for 1 month and stopped using ovulation test and guess what i feel pregnant sadly i miscarriage at 6 weeks but 4 weeks later i found out i was pregnant again and i now have a healthy 6 month old baby boy.    don't giver up but relax and enjoy the time with your boyfriend x
93d1272e676f48f0eee8d8378c0b91f2aa	well, to stop confusion i would look at it like this; she wont be a year old until the 31st of July, so go by the 31 of each month ( if the month has a 31st) i know what you are saying, i thought about the same thing with my kiddos but at the end of the day they are a year old after the whole year has passed and if you have a leap year.... i wont go there! :) just go by months and you will be just about right! :)|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	She's too old to count in weeks now - go by months.  So on the 31st of each month (or the last day if not 31) she gains another month.  If you keep counting in weeks her birthday will not land on July 31st, 2009!  Remember that there are not 4 weeks in every month but 4.3 months.|`|tmh42R6Caa	I would say she'll be 6 months on January 31st.|`|IEdgfQAMaa	No, she'll be 6 months old on January 31st.|`|n1s9jbnNaa	depends if your going on months based on weeks or actual months based on jan, feb, march and so on. Usually most people go based on months because counting weeks gets very complicated. It up to you how you want to count. But when your baby is one year old will she be one or 52 weeks? its up to you...|`|TqOdbhNAaa	My daughter was also born on 7/31.  Technically, she's 26 weeks today but officially 6 months on Saturday.  It's sorta like pregnancy being 9 months and at the same time 40 weeks.  Since not all months are 28 days (4 weeks), it really just depends on how you want to track the time.  After a certain point, it's just easier to look at the date and not worry about the individual weeks.  I have a great baby book, "The First Year Week by Week" and it goes by week but after 4 months, it has the month as well.  If you want to track her age by weeks, that's fine!  Just remember that in the end, it's the actual date that doctors look at.    Good luck and happy 6 months to you, too!
QhVCn7rsaa	Your body can take to to re-regulate itself when you are on the pill. If you are still worried about being pregnant take a digital test they will give you an exact pregnant/not pregnant answer. Also if you are under any kind of stress that can upset your cycle.    Good Luck|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Your body needs to get back on track since you were on the pill and now you are not. Give it some time until it regulates.|`|1Sf0MzHTaa	Go to the doctor and have a blood test done.    Anytime you miss more than one pill in a row the pills are no longer effective. It says that on they package. You could be pregnant or it could have just really messed up your cycle.     Good luck!|`|4eurlgWCaa	It sounds like your body its a little lost with the hormones, just to be sure you can get another test
6DQSkKgWaa	That is very low.  The normal sperm count should be at least 20 million per ml.  According to your question, there are only 800 per ml.  (There are about 30 ml per ounce, to give you an idea of how much a milliliter is.)    However, if you are being tested because of fertility it also depends on the shape and size of the sperm, what percentage are motile, and how much ejaculate is present.    You need to discuss this with your doctor.  There are methods available to concentrate the semen to increase the percentage of sperm.|`|xpstigPTaa	I'm not sure but you should really talk to your doctor about that. I'm sorry I couldn't help. Good luck and call your doctor.|`|BU1f41Wcaa	Maybe you should ask your doctor?
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	There is nothing to worry about, cramping is actually pretty normal throughout pregnancy. As long as it isnt severe cramping or accompanied with bleeding then it sounds like your pregnancy is progressing like normal. Good luck and congratulations.|`|gNaxbSFXaa	aww hunny this is natural, its your body adjusting to the amazing thing happening to it. good luck and all the best with the bab babs xxx|`|83905a9de542a6f172297328fe300a63aa	No its normal. My mom had it too when she carried me|`|uDdEN2tTaa	I have had two children, and with both pregnancies I also had the cramping... Its just your uterus stretching from the baby growing the the fluids....  Plus the muscles in that area...  Sweetie, you will be fine.. and Congrats!!!!
DDswEgtZaa	must be exactly the same (first, middle, last).  my parents didn't want my brother to be the 3rd so they changed his middle name.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	Every one wanted me to name my son after my husband but instead of making him a II or a Jr we gave him My husband Initials and we have done the same for our 2nd boy who is also due in may...just something to think about! :)    Our way of giving something of the dad  Lucas Wayne (dad)  Landen Wyatt  Lane Westen :)    Just a thought if you didn't want to do the Jr thing! :)|`|72SrLDQ3aa	I think the names all have to match.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	To be JR he has to have the same name as his father  First middle(if had one) last    If a different middle name is used, he will not be jr|`|heC9aQ18aa	A jr is only a jr when the name matches the father's name in every single way. It used to be slightly different in the past but not anymore. Now if the father is named Richard Blake Prentiss, the baby in order to be a jr will have to be named Richard Blake Prentiss too. If you were to name him Richard Andrew Prentiss, he would not be a jr at all.  I would go with the option of different middle name. Many boys hate being jr's and it has caused many problems for many. A friend of my family had a son who was a jr and when the son got speeding tickets, the father would be the one getting them on his record. It was a real pain. Have heard many horror stories about sr and jr. Plus every kid deserves his own name and identity.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	Jr. requires all 3 names to match.|`|gdnL63ngaa	You can have a different middle for sure, perhaps honouring someone else, like your father, perhaps?|`|IvkNTqDMaa	If the baby's name does not match EXACTLY, then he is NOT a Jr.|`|5uwfpC8oaa	maybe use ur BF first name and give your little boy a middle name unique to him, im not sure what the rules are as far as using jnr, i would though, he is still named after his dad    congrats!|`|yxgoG4wqaa	I think traditionally, Junior is the full father's name.  But I think you can do whatever you like.  If you want to just do the same first name and have a unique middle name, I think it would be ok to put the Jr on the end.|`|vOD4Urzdaa	Does he need a Jr. ? I think it needs to be the whole thing if you're using that. But it would be cuter to just use the first name and use something else for a middle name.|`|wi6mkT30aa	The child has to have the exact same name, if it's not the exact same name as the father then it's not a JR.      JR Example:    Dad: Joseph Benjamin Miller    Son: Joseph Benjamin Miller JR        Not a JR Example:    Dad: Joseph Benjamin Miller    Son: Joseph Micheal Miller        I hope that helped and congrats on your having a baby boy soon! =)|`|M2e4kkEuaa	you should try and change the spelling around on your BFs name with your sons.       =]|`|l1BG0Y9Daa	match excactly|`|rOBTMriCaa	To be considered a Jr all three names have to match.  If you aren't into the baby having the same name and being a junior a friend of mine named her son so that he shared the same initials as his daddy.
QhVCn7rsaa	The yellow stuff is Bile your stomach acid. It's possible it may have burned your insides on the way up therefore the blood.    Nothing to worry about. Try to keep a bottle of water with you when you feel nauseated that way if you have the water in your stomach you will only throw it up.    Good Luck|`|gx4s68s8aa	Since there was so little then there is nothing to be concerned about.  Likely since it is winter your throat might be a little sore anyway.  Along with that and since you have been dry heaving frequently this could make it rather raw in your throat.  If the bleeding is quite a bit heavier or if it happens all the time, then you might need to be concerned.  Until then, drink some herbal tea with honey and it should sooth your throat.     Sometimes when I have been throwing up a lot or dry heaving a little bit of blood comes up.  It is rather common.  So don't worry unless it get much worse.  I know it can be scary the first time that happens though.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Since u hadnt eaten anything its more than likely that ur stomach acids just burned ur esophagus a lil and thats where the blood came from. When u feel like u wanna birth fool ur stomach and stick at least a piece of candy in there so when u barf u'll barf something and not acids. If u are really worried call ur OB again and tell them the situation. Good luck.|`|YseGAHIfaa	oh my god..!! iv had blood in my sick before, i went to the hospital & all they said is that as i was heaving/straining to be sick one of my blood vessels popped..!!    relax & enjoy your pregnancy..!!    lots of luck x|`|rIOD8tgvaa	Yes, you can damage or rupture blood vessels in your throat and they can bleed because of throwing up so much. The yellow fluid tells me there is not much left in your stomach except fluids.  I just spent days with a family friend who was throwing up with strings of blood in his vomit.  You need to be careful because you are pregnant.  You may need IV fluids and you also need to be checked.  I threw up while pregnant with my second child and had abdominal pain. I had my appendix removed while I was pregnant!  Take care and take the advice of your boyfriend.|`|zuZKj3xXaa	the yellow in it is Acidic.. The blood is from your throat being burned from puking and gagging so much :(your throat is just raw .your Fine :)
SnVwHG3iaa	Hey    I know exactly where your coming from.  I fell pregnant with 3 months of being with my partner, sadly that ended in my son being stillborn at 34 weeks beginning of December.  My dad and step mum were trying for my little brother for 2 years, and when they decided they would stop trying, and just let things happen she fell pregnant the next month.    Me and my partner have decided we would like to try again, and i'm trying not to think about it too much, because i know it won't happen, so i'm trying to let things happen on their own like last time, it's just hard not trying to think of it.    Best advise i can give for high chances of conceiving are having regular sex every other day, keeps the sperm count high and healthy.  Laying down 20-30 minutes after sex with a pillow under your bum, helps the sperm swim to the egg.  Deep penetration when a man ejaculates helps bring the sperm closer to the cervix for a higher chance for them to get through.    Hope things work out for you soon, best of luck xx|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	I think that we just get to stressed out about it, Have intercourse too much and it just becomes a chore.  When the pressure is off our body's are more relaxed.  So when you do try again. Don"t try..,LOL|`|IUnrYCx9aa	How long did you try for?  I've heard that too...when you stop thinking about it, sometimes it happens.  I guess for the future, try to calculate when you are ovulating and have sex around that time. I've heard you should have sex about every other day to have the best chance.  Good luck.
OrKpKxkHaa	Ugh I know how you feel! My baby is almost 3 months old and all day I try and nap but she wakes up as soon as I settle. She sleeps through the night but once I get her down....I'm wide awake! I get hungry, I go online, try and watch tv, nothing works! I just end up staying awake until around 1 am. Sorry to say there is no end in sight anytime soon hun so get used to it! Good luck!|`|UXhFcHCHaa	well i know how you feel. last night i was dreaming i was driving in a circle and i crashed and i jumped out the car but they caught me but i kept seeing myself getting higher and higher then i woke up and all i could think about was work. im having some issues here. i stayed up for an hour just thinking of work and im so tired of it. then i had a dream i was at the hospital and there were all these drug addicts coming up to random people to get thier blood to get high on. they poked me 3 times and i could see my hand swell. then i had another one where i was gabby solis from depserate housewives and i was having sex with a guy and i was orgaisming. omg i could feel it everywhere. i had those dreams when i was prego but last night omg it was awesome.|`|YW72TLapaa	I know exactly how you feel!  i went throught he same thing at about the same time, i coudlnt go to sleep but when i did i had the most outrageous dreams, even very very scary dreams i would wake up sweating and feeling horribly scared, a few times i had to ask my hubby to hold me from how scared i was then i was afraid to just fall asleep and during the day i could just fall asleep at my desk.  It did go away eventually but then it was just hard to sleep and i woudl only sleep 4 hrs at a time, everyone told me it was mother natures way of preparing me for what was coming and i think its true cause since i had the baby i have never had trouble sleeping only 2 hrs at a time, everyone was surprised cause when i came home from the hospital i never spent a day in bed, i did everythign for my son and in the apt.   Now he is 2 1/2  months, still waking up every two hrs to eat. he goes to sleep at 11 pm or 12am and i have to be out of bed by 7am the latest and im pretty much ok, i do feel tired but not like i should.
79001534b8f79771dce5eae9d3d448a7aa	Sorry about your brother.    Janelyn is cute.|`|7RQDM1HGaa	That's a beautiful name. And the meaning behind it is also great. I think he would really appreciate that.|`|9iXGakohaa	That's not dumb at all it's very sweet. Personally Janelyn doesn't roll off my tongue well. It's a very unusual name. If you are trying to get something similar to John maybe go for Jonna or Johanna instead. Good luck!|`|T7uFoSUQaa	That is not dumb at all! That would be a great way to honor your fallen brother. You could do Janelyn Johnna or something .|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Sorry to hear that...   I do not care for Janelyn.  Actually, Jack is an old nickname for John, and Sean is the Irish form of John.  To give you ideas to spring off of.  Therefore Jacqeline is the female version of John (however you'd like to spell it, there are many spellings, like Jacqelyn, Jacklyn, etc.).  And with Sean, you could name her Shawna or Sinann (pronounced Shuh-NAWN).    Or, simply name her Jane.|`|twyjXSVuaa	That's a lovely idea but I personally don't think Janelyn is close to John. I know Jane is the female version of John but why not call your baby Sian which is the Welsh version of Jane and is pronouned Sharn. It's a nice twist and ir would still be named after your brother.  Janelyn is nice too though|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	how about Johnna  or Johanna|`|QBKzvw4faa	i think thats a cute idea.. what about Janelle.. kinda sounds like john at the first.. i also really love the name Jaelynn.. =).. sorry about your brother and congrats on the baby..|`|qeT182Ooaa	I think its pretty cool to honor your brother but Im not a big fan of the name Janelyn. What about just  naming the baby a name that begins with a J.    Jazmine  Jocelyn  Janell   Jaylin|`|vOD4Urzdaa	It's definatly not dumb to. I personally don't adore that name. Maybe something more like Jeanne or something.     Try this site. I have it linked to all the names linked to John. Male and Female unfortunatly.     http://www.behindthename.com/php/related...|`|sQYsMbQyaa	i think jonie and sorry to hear that|`|RqhTnwMkaa	Hi! What about Joanie or Joaney, it does sound like Johnnie!!! So sorry bout your brother.
xzh8r0jIaa	i also had braxton's alittle early for a while, around 25 wks and then they slowed down , but now at 37 wks for the last week they have really picked  back up....but right now i have this warm crampy feeling in my lower abdomen, kinda sore feeling above my butt, alittle on my sides...    this has been going on for 2 hours since i have been at work. something is different, something is going on here....|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Braxton hicks don't mean labor isn't far away.  Some women have them from the early 20 weeks or some women get them at the end of the pregnancy.  It means absolutely nothing when you get braxton hicks.  Now if you have 6 or more in an hour or they start coming in a consisten pattern, then you need to call the doctor.  I have been nesting on and off this entire pregnancy and I am still pregnant.  Again it means nothing at all.  Your term for your pregnancy, so really it can be any minute or it can be a couple weeks.  Make sure your walking, doing squats to help engage baby, and have sex if you can to help soften the cervix.  Goodluck|`|fMxVDps3aa	I had braxton hicks from around 5months along with my 4th child. It does not mean anything really. Just wait to see what your doc says when you get examined.|`|zuZKj3xXaa	Braxtons don't really mean anything, they just happen lol ive been putting up with them since week 20.. So if they meant that labor was coming, id be screwd ha ha. if they get stronger, and closer together.. They could turn into Real contractions :( so watch out for that..were Due the same day! Feb 19th :) im having a beebee GIRL! and i have an appointment today :) lol im EXCITED!!!! sorry, got off the subject..have you been paying attention to if you've lost your plug yet? you can lose it slowly..or all at once, ive been losing mine slowly.. all that means is that its more likely to go full term :)
JhcOeplZaa	My back did not start hurting till i started to show and the weight has taken a toll on my back now(36 1/2 weeks prego). But I realized I was pregnant 2 weeks into it b/c my boobs where sore and I gained an appetite.  Good Luck|`|AA12107422	It's a possibility. My back did hurt early in my last pregnancy. Were you trying to get pregnant? If so, just wait a few days past the day you were suppose to start, & take a test. If its neg. & you think you still are preg. -- go have a blood test done! They are most accurate! Good Luck!|`|YK8P5rNXaa	Well my back never herded in any of my pregnancies but idk just wait for you period to get here then you will know or take a test 5 days before your missed period... Good luck!    If you have that kind of pain then i think you may be pregnant cus i had the same thing that happened to me when i was about a month pregnant when the pain came from the back to the front.... So take a test i think you might be pregnant.....Good luck again!!!!!
9a3sNrEqaa	YOU ARE NEVER SUPPOSED TO REUSE A VACUTAINER EVER!! Even if its the same patient! Your also not supposed to attempt a draw twice in one arm. If you can't obtain the sample you must ask someone else. (ie. the patients median cubital is notaccessiblee) If your having trouble obtaining blood sample make sure that your following the correct steps.Make sure that you are not trying to obtain the sample without the vial connected into the vacutainer as it won't suction. GOOD LUCK!!!!
ZNhP3mpUaa	Everyone takes things differently, give him some time, it's VERY life altering information to take in... he stuck it in, he can deal with what comes out!! It'll be ok... I was shocked at first too, and then realized it's going to be the greatest thing in the world!! Good luck!|`|0VJE7BXmaa	You will have to look to your immediate family, parents, brothers, sister, aunts and uncles, etc. for support.  What kind of reaction did you expect?  You're not married, and the baby is unplanned.  Of course he's going to be shocked and nervous.|`|UgvLTFmSaa	Well,maybe he will come around, maybe he's scared. He probably wasnt expecting it.|`|v3LnJycKaa	men go through the same range of emotion that women do, just in a different way, his "atittude" may just be shock and his way of "getting used to the idea" give him time, be there to talk if he wants to, and try your best to understand. Basically treat him the exact same way you want him to treat you when you start complaing about the uncomfortable-ness of pregnancy, you know they will never "understand it" but you want him to make you feel like he is right there with you as uncomfy as you!|`|C4ibOR7Laa	ask him if he wants this baby or not, how old are you both? how long have you been together? do YOU want this baby? could you do it alone?|`|kJ4g1vujaa	It will all turn out ok.  Its a big shock but it will be fantastic.|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	He should of thought about that before he got you pregnant.|`|Dhsyroekaa	its a huge deal, his life will be changed forever. you just need to sit down and talk to him, see how he feels|`|w0eRRsoVaa	When it's not a planned pregnancy, you have to allow the shock factor to wear off before determining whether or not he will be in your lives.  Try getting him to sit down with you, ask him what he's thinking and feeling.  Just be sure to listen, attempt not to get upset if he says things that aren't what you want to hear.  I always live by the motto of, "Hope for the best, expect the worst" which allows you the mindset to prepare for all possibilities.|`|8G8ZbNLQaa	Most men only think of the sex, but if he was having unprotected sex then he has to face up to his responsibilities. Some men are so grateful to be having sex that the last thing they think about is infections or a baby. I guess everybody makes mistakes and maybe you weren't thinking properly either as now you're in a dilemma with a man you're not sure about. I would say immature man, but most men are like that until they're old. I hope it works out for you.|`|pkZBBvlzaa	the most important thing you need to ask yourself is: Do i want the baby?    if you're sure you want a child then you need to ask a second question:do I really want to be with him?    if yes, try to have a nice chat with him.ask him what scares him about having a baby and all sorts of questions relevant.    maybe he is just in shock and just needs some time on his own to think about all the adjustments he needs to make in his life    good luck.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	I got pregnant and when I told the father, he left the state before she was born. He didn't want a baby, and I wanted her. The writing was on the wall.   I knew in my heart that I was going to have to do it myself, and I did and have. She is now 15.  If you want this child, you will HAVE to cope whether or not the father supports you. It's called getting tough and growing up. If he does not want this child, there will be NOTHING you can do other than try to get child support. NOTHING.   The sad fact is, there are a lot of women out there who get left by their men when they get pregnant, and leave the woman to be the responsible party, and you need to realize that you may in fact, become one of those women.|`|qStmw7qgaa	This is a very big deal and he is probably scared.  Give him some time, but also make sure he understands just how important his support and love is to you.  But most likely he is just scared, and hopefully he will come around soon.|`|aEgYElA8aa	From experience dont get an abortion because you think its what he wants. You will adore and take care of this baby with or without him. Please dont make the mistake i did, its true what they say, it really does stay with you forever :(|`|QufZeqlVaa	it might be difficult the same thing happen to me when i was dating my husband back then he dint like the idea wanted me to have abortion told him the heck with you if you dont like it then leave. it takes two to bring a  baby to this world. anyway after a week he got over it and we got married 6 years now and have 2 kids and am pregnant again.|`|Acwau1Esaa	One of two things. You either wait and see if he comes around as guys dont think about what the girls going through they just panic and want to run unless they are older and ready to settle. I have an 8 year old with my ex girlfriend and when she was first pregnant I ran a mile. I then saw the error of my ways and we where together for four years, three of the first of my childs life and though it never worked out we both do all we can for her. Second if he is not interested find out what help you can get from medical to financial so you know you can be as ready as possible to raise your child alone. Have you a brother/sister or good friend who you can take to appointments and such.This way you wont feel so alone.|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	was the baby planned? Guys don't do well when they realize how little control they have over pregnancy, except for the stupid obvious part of having sex. That's the biggest problems about getting pregnant before marriage as the commitment part of the relationship is not solidified and this is quite a test. You CAN cope without his support. Unfortunately an awful lot of women do. It won't be easy, but you won't be alone; you'll have this wonderful baby who might inspire you to be something greater than you could have imagined before tihs.|`|zuZKj3xXaa	Next hes gonna Deny that its His :) happens All the time...  Happend to me.  dont expect him to even stick around, he might be all up for it for a while.. then it'll occur to him " o ****, my lifes over.. i have a responsibility now!" it'll scare him... then he'll Bail...your pretty much on your own..:) im sorry.....    Due Feb 19th!|`|KGnpgBfVaa	straight out talk to him about it. He's going to have to face to sometime, why not now? You deserve to know if he's going to be there for you and your child, and if he doesn't want anything to do with the baby, say screw it, you don't need your child around someone who doesn't care, I'm sure their are plenty of other people(suck as family) who will love this child just as much as you do. Mothers raise babies all the time with no help what so ever, and if you do need help, you can always take him to court. It's his responsibility to help cover the costs of this child, if he doesn't want to be involved, the least he can do is cooperate and it he doesn't have to be.|`|AXEqOEloaa	I think having a baby will shock anyone, we were TTC and when I found out I was pregnant we both freaked out. Don't jump to the worst case senario and assume anything, you need to give him a little time to adjust and then sit down with him and ask him what he thinks and feels.|`|rt4OnxkYaa	well he needs to step up and be a man, not matter how old he is.  if he cant do that then oh well... you can cope w.o his support.. you were mature enough to have sex,..now you will be mature enough to deal with a pregnancy. everything will be OK.. he might just need some time.|`|LGNyapa1aa	Well, i can imagine he's just really shocked YOU NEED TO TALK, then you will know how he feels.    Good luck
0ZnX6Qjyaa	nope, if it did they would have laws against it|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  Not at all.  Babies have traveled in cars for as long as there have been cars.|`|AA12041870	No.  Someone is trying to make you alter your plans to keep the baby near them a little longer.  Babies love to sleep and ride.  Good luck on your move.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	it's fine...just stop every so often. My son was 1 1/2 months old the first time we drove an hour and a half to my uncles for a clam bake... it ended up being longer because of traffic though..he slept the whole time!|`|IEdgfQAMaa	no, it won't harm the baby as long as she's properly hydrated, and the temperature in the car is not too hot/cold.  Let her move/walk around during your stops, and she'll be just fine.|`|BY4ZVyRHaa	no there is no harm in it at all. my husband travel from NC to Ohio all the time with our 2 year old and 5 month old they both sleep the majority of the way and only wake up once or twice to eat. some times my oldest won't wake up but the youngest is breast fed so she'll wake up maybe twice to eat. our last trip she only woke up once. we tend to travel at night because they'll usually sleep the whole time.|`|vzDmaWqaaa	Travel with a baby will not harm her.  Especially since its only one day.  You will need to stop frequently to let her move around because like anyone she will get tired of sitting and get grumpy.  It will probably be way more trying on you lugging all her stuff, driving and worrying about her.  Carefully strap her into the center of the back seat.  Give her all her favorite stuff and she will probably sleep alot of the time.  Good Luck that night.|`|5yq4oV56aa	i moved from nh to sc 6 months ago i have 5 kids 9,6,4,3,and now 10 months old it was a 17-18 hr drive and i stopped often though and they all did just fine|`|ncpl2ruzaa	There is no harm in traveling with your baby, as long as you do take frequent stops to change them and let them get alittle room to relax without being strapped in a carseat. I traveled with my son when he was 3 months on a 5-6 hour drive we left at night though so he pretty much slept the whole way. Just a suggestion mayb leave around her bedtime so she sleeps most the way.|`|I4a8zI1gaa	Definitely no harm.  I'm sure if you spent every day and every waking hour traveling in a car for endless hours, yeah it would definitely affect her development, etc.  But for one trip back home - she'll be fine!  She may even sleep.  What I would suggest (what we did with dylan for a 5 hour drive when he was like 3 or 4 months) .. is leave at night or when she'd be going down to sleep.  That way, she's sleeping anyway and it's like the drive never occured for her!      Just be prepared if she gets fussy, hungry, etc.  Have something semi-mapped out so that if you need to stop, you know a safe place to stop and take care of her, feed her, change her, let her stretch out a little, etc.  Is someone going with you?  IT may help to have someone drive and someone sit in back with her.      Just a thought... but yeah you'll be fine!!  Enjoy the drive and drive safe!|`|OrKpKxkHaa	No. Thats crazy. I had to do it when my oldest daughter was just under a year old. I pulled the airbag fuse out from under the hood of the car and kept her next to me in the front. She was happy to see me the whole time and I could get her pacifier for her, hold a bottle for her or just talk to her. We stopped every couple hours to change her diaper, me to pee and eat and I would just let her crawl around the backseat for a few minutes. If anything, it will be a time to remember lol. Good luck!|`|HvALvdc7aa	I just took my 8 week old baby on a 4 hour trip last weekend. She did fine . She actually slept longer in the car then she does at night. Go figure.........|`|vue9NOhYaa	It's fine.  You WILL need to stop a couple of times for feeds and diaper changes, (and for YOU to eat and pee) so that will give everyone a chance to stretch and move around a bit.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	No it wont harm the baby just make sure you stop pretty regularly to feed her and check her diaper.
IsnHXRo4aa	that doesn't sound like a tantrum that sounds like a normal toddler exploring his newly acquired motor skills|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	That's not a tantrum, he's probably just having fun.  My daughter hits her head all the time and laughs about it.  A tantrum is when she is arching her back screaming, won't sit up, won't stand, won't lay down, etc.|`|XOtOMncwaa	My sons also entered the tantrum stage when he doesn't get what he wants... he throws himself on the floor and flails around while screaming... I just give him "the look" and he stops... It's normal... kids around that age tend to get frustrated easily, they try to express themselves and don't know how, so they easiest way for them to express themselves is through a tantrum... just try to figure out what she wants, and if she wants something she can't have just let the tantrum pass, or try to distract her with something else.|`|3Qxqh68xaa	Kids experss their frustration at not being able to communicate their needs mroe efficiently in different ways.  My son lies on the floor and repeatedly bangs his head into the floor until I can figure out what he needs.  Don't be too worried.  As my son's doctor told me... they will never do it to the point of doing damage to themselves,... but i have trouble believing this.

AA12324049	You definitely have cause for concern!  My son was 7 weeks premature but he still crawled by 8 months and walked at 16 months.  It is sad that the parents of the boy won't seek help for him - they are either naive or in deep denial.  Here is a suggestion: maybe you could have a peditrician visit the class to take a look at all the kids to see if he sees any problems.  Since you probably can't do this without consent, you could send a permission slip to all the parents for them to sign that their child can participate in a free health screening.  Hopefully, his parents will be one of the ones to grant permission as it is in the best interest of their son.  Hope this helps!|`|97e755fe7f3c18b6cabd7abbcfa7ba43aa	That is strange and his parents need to realize they need to get their child checked out. Maybe you could find a book on the stages of development and give it to the parents. If they get offended and remove their child, most other day cares will tell them the same thing.|`|N2fIorzGaa	i think they need to spend more time with him. most babies iv seen that do the barley get any Ation from the baby's parents.|`|I4a8zI1gaa	His parents need to start being concerned.  It sounds like it could possibly be autism - or even cerebral palsy.  I feel horrible for the little guy because his parents are neglecting his needs right now.      However, I have no idea what the situation is because I don't see this boy and i'm obviously not his parent, but if his doctor recommended it, and he still is suffering - there has to be someway to convince his parents.  Can you contact the health department?  I don't know.. I just hope he gets the help that he needs!  All you can do is work with him and play with him adn try to get him to respond.  He may need special attention, and you may be just the person to give it to him! :)|`|EL3P7YA4aa	Well the way you described him my sister Alyssa is like that..she can't crawl, stand, feed herself, the only thing she can do is roll over n hold her bottle.she is 7 years old and she is handicapped...she has brain damage and severe cerebral palsy... honestly he may have some type of something like cerebral palsy or something...i would call his parents and ask them to take him to the doctor and see if they can find anything wrong...i would be very concerned too...|`|XKfrNzhUaa	my friend had a boy at 15 months didn't crawl, she thought there was something wrong so she brought him to the doctors but the doc said he was fine he scooted around on his butt, but never crawled he just started walking. it may be that he wasn't put on his belly at a younger age so he didn't tone his muscles and he might have just been held all the time. I also own a home daycare and i would talk to the parents about it but dont be to pushy they will get offended and think you are calling them bad parents. he is their child and they need to make their own choices in raising him. but while he is in your care try working with him. you can try having the other children crawl while your helping him move his arms and knees. he might start doing it on his own after a while.|`|7s7TKHtKaa	yes my niece didn't walk til she was 22 months. she went to therapy they told us she was able to but that's the only thing she could Control herself. but she scooted on she butt all around the room she just would not crawl.
6VbNJOtfaa	If you want to be responsible and take care of the child then it sounds like you need to get the courts involved.  Your ex cannot tell you that she will raise your son- you have just as many rights as she does.  If you love the woman you are with I suggest trying to make her a part of your sons life as much as you can.  What may seem like a terrible situation can also turn out well- a child cannot have too much love.  DO NOT get back with the ex just because you want to be part of your sons life.  Marriage/commitment based on children does not work.  You can accomplish this while still living your life with the woman you love.      With so many men out there who want nothing to do with their children this lady should be grateful that you want to be there!  She needs to count her blessings!  You need to be persistent and whatever you do remember that this is your child, too, and you have all the rights that she does!    Good luck!  Everything works out in the end- it always does!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	It really doesn't matter if you are romantically involved with your child's other parent.  It is still your child.  You are still that child's parent.     The two of you need to get lawyers & work out a custody agreement now, one that is very detailed & does not expect you to cooperate with each other.  One that tells everyone exactly what is expected of them and of their interactions with each other.  One that has very clear guidelines for what should be done when changes are needed.    Then, you need to stick with it throughout your child's life.   The sooner you do this, the sooner you can both get down to the important responsibilities of being parents to your child.     Your current girlfriend will have to accept that your life has changed permanently.  She can continue with you on your new path as a parent, or she can move on, continuing on her own path in life.|`|p3NW0Mstaa	First be sure this child is yours, get a test.  If it is, and you are honorable by wanting to be a part of his life, see if there is a chapter of ADAM in your area.  they handle divorces from the male side, but also cover child / dependent situations at a cost you can afford.   YOu also have rights even if she is mad and don't like it, take those rights for a walk, exercise them!  Keep your GF on board, and aware of what you are planning, she loves you enough she stay and help you fight for what is right.  I did with my man 25 years ago with his daughter and we now have her two children as grand babies and my two sons with him are great uncles!  Good luck!|`|AA10727113	You could get the courts involved since it is your child as well.  Depends on how far you are willing to go to be a part of your son's life.|`|6EnQYZEOaa	First things first you need to get a lawyer and get your visitation/custody rights which ever you want,second you will love and get a great bond with your son no matter what that is your child and for your girlfriend to say it doesn't bother her LIAR she is probably very hurt but doesn't want to admit it maybe in fear that it would hurt you and you would feel like you would have to choose put yourself in her shoes and say she was pregnant to another man....As a parent you have rights|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Just be a dad to the child.I do not know what to say really.Just make sure you are their for the child.
2gUBpC62aa	When babies are born, the bones that make up the skull are intentionally soft and separated.  This allows the child to be born through the birth canal, as well as allowing the the head to grow and expand after birth.  The fontanelle should close after only several months, so this definately should not be a premature closure if your child is almost a year old.  I would recommend taking your child to your pediatrician, or call and ask to speak with a nurse to help answer any of your questions.  Also, your child should be due to receive vaccines soon, so you can always ask during your visit if you are scheduled to see your practitioner soon.  Its better to be a parent who asks your Doctor/Nurse too many questions than not enough.When it comes to anything suspicious regarding your child's head development, I would seek out a medical source.|`|HHTLpwrgaa	gfsgfssdg|`|6E9sQbIcaa	a yeah mostly it will close and be a boon together. So dont worrie and if you dont trust go to a doctor but i think it normal|`|UV5htpg3aa	At 4 moths old the doctor thought my son's soft spot was fusing together, after multiple head x-rays, turned out to be within normal range.  I would ask the pediatrician to be certain.|`|6cfb6cd3197d1e471020aecf96fc5902aa	If you honestly think that the babies fontanelle has closed you should definatly take the baby to the pediatrician.  My sisters daughter has the same thing and if you dont take care of this now the babies head will be misshapen and can lead to other medical problems down the road.
PbCvWgC7aa	i know, its COMPLETELY frustrating. why did our bodies have to be so darn complicated?? but yes, i've had weird things happen with my ovulation, especially timing. i always use OPK's (ovulation predictor kits) and so i KNOW when i'm ovulating. and i've ovulated just a day after my period, and also just days before. i've heard this could be a sign of pcos, which will make getting pregnant much more difficult. i haven't gone to the doctors yet to find out for sure. but yes, ovulation can be different every cycle, so keep on trying and dont give up. because you may just have had a normal ovulation cycle during that one time that you didn't try. be consistent. and best of luck to you!! i hope you get your little miracle baby!!    baby dust*********
G5Ut9prSaa	I think you should take a pregnancy test just to be safe (clomid is NOT to be taken while pregnant). If it comes up negative, I'd believe it. Maybe though you should call your doctor or a nurse hotline and ask them if you should start the clomid, I'm not sure if spotting for one day counts as a beginning of a cycle or not.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I think you should.It might regulate your cycle.

Jhkoz18Xaa	There are many women with pregnancy symptoms, even when you are not pregnant.  Early Pregnancy symptoms are different from one woman to the other but for most women, missing a menstrual period is usually the very first sign that they are pregnant. Nausea and morning sickness are usually among the earliest pregnancy symptoms. Even before missing a period, some pregnant women report having to go to the bathroom more often. Tiredness and exhaustion could be among the very early sign of pregnancy. Breasts may often become tender, similar to the way they feel before your period. Having a typical biphasic or triphasic temperature chart.|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Yes it is possible to begin having symptoms before a missed period.  Women who produce a lot of the pregnancy hormone HCG see to have a little more of the nausea.  Since you had sex prior to ovulation most likely the egg would have implanted already.  The fact that your Temperature is high is a good sign.  if it is in the high 98 - 99 degree mark sounds good.  But pregnancy is one of those things that we just do not know until we test and get a Positive result.  Sometimes we want something so bad that we have symptoms.  Good luck.  Hope this was your month.|`|ox6SXta4aa	I think they all are good indicators of being pregnant.  I had all these symptoms too before I found out I was.  I think if you really are paying attention to your body then you will notice that they aren't premenstrual symptoms but something a little more...Good Luck!|`|tdNfQWaAaa	It could very well mean that you are pregnant! But it is to early to tell. If you wanted to you get take an early HPT, but to get the best results I would wait untill the first day of your missed period. I have heard that it take some women weeks to finally get a positive. So if you think you are and you get a negative, dont get to discouraged. And if your AF shows up, try not to get to discouraged then either.. It will happen when the time is right, but for now, I'd go get an early detection HPT!! Good luck!!!! Lots of baby dust!!!|`|J42Q48cAaa	How strange that you and I are in the same boat, exactly to the day almost,  I have been feeling the same way the past few days. AF is due Tuesday for me though. Last month I stressed so much about TTC that I made my cycle 3 days late (this has never happend, always on time) so I took a PT and it was Neg. Af came the next day. I do agree with waiting until you are at least a day late, then test. Good luck and keep us posted. BABY DUST!!!!
G5Ut9prSaa	I'm guessing you are trying to get pregnant. When my husband and I started trying, I too had a whack of new symptoms that would go on, and I figured I must have been pregnant. Sadly, never was, it was just new symptoms for my period. I think sometimes we want to be pregnant so badly we can cause ourselves to have pregnancy symptoms... or at least I can!|`|gwuTKiNXaa	yes it is.. It's not really normal to have all of those symptoms so early but every women is different so it is very possible. I would wait until maybe tuesday and if you don't get it take a test. I would tell you to test early but there's a chance you may have ovulated late so you never know plus the test can be costly and money is tight in the world right now. if you can wait I would wait until Tuesday|`|rDsKB0uXaa	idk|`|YK8P5rNXaa	You could be pregnant maybe you should take a test now.... Take 5 days before your missed period first Response it always worked for me. Good luck!|`|EoawVhBTaa	Yes it is possible. Check out this site    http://www.estronaut.com/a/pregnancy_sym...|`|giEXhSTIaa	Hmm. The heavy breasts indicate a period. The nausea can indicate pregnancy. It's a tough one. I'm guessing you haven't missed a period yet? I would wait till the day your period is due, or maybe a few days later (if you don't come on and are late) to test. If your concerned see your GP. Good luck. :)
xpstigPTaa	of course there is a chance you are pregnant. You didn't give any details though so we don't even know if it was around your time of ovulation. Sorry.|`|4DoXomHZaa	20% in any given month.    However, it's going to take more than twice in 1.5 months to get the job done. Sperm can live for up to 5 days inside, but your egg is only viable for 24 hours.|`|Jhkoz18Xaa	Anytime you are making love without contraception there is a good chance getting pregnant.  Take some of the quizzes to find out your likelyhood.  http://babymed.com/quizzes/|`|AjwXFXiVaa	Yes, If your not using some kind of birth control, there's always the possibility of pregnancy. It just depends on when it happened and if you were ovulating around that time.
H74F8jxuaa	You can count 14 days before you expect your period and it can give you an idea.  I have 32-38 day periods, so I know how you feel about not knowing when ovulation occurs.  I bought the Clearblue fertility monitor and I know when I am ovulating now.  It is worth the money.  You can get good deals on ebay.|`|4DoXomHZaa	They have tests called Ovulation Predictors (OPKs) that you can buy at any Walmart. There are instructions for which day to pee on them. When it turns positive, you will ovulate in 24-48 hours.    I can't believe your doctors didn't tell you about these. Not very good docs.
lkhCeAdJaa	Just to let you know, not all pregnant women vomit.  And out of those that do, most are not that bad.  A lot of women exaggerate how bad the vomiting is for whatever reason.    there are a very few who do get the vomiting part of pregnancy VERY badly, but for the most part, most don't.    Pregnant five times....vomited ONE time.    And oh yeah...you WILL be able to lift things, you WILL be able to push your grocery cart around the store, you WILL be able to take a walk around the block.  You also WILL be able to carry your own bags and bend over to tie your shoes.........please don't be one of the whiny ones;-)|`|AkFag8tNaa	Not everyone experiences morning sickness. I only vomited once and was pregnant twice.....however, there are some safe anti-naseau medicines for those expecting moms who have a really hard time. My pregnancies were pretty uneventful aside from some digestive issues w/my second (but nothing that needed medical intervention). Staying calm was a bigger issue w/my first (he was the first afterall and I didn't know what to expect). I just read about what to expect (symptom wise) each month and felt better after each ultrasound. Just keep in mind that complications are rare and modern medical technology is a wonderful thing!|`|r07BwhO1aa	Every woman is different sweetie, just know that what ever your journey to having a baby is it will be sooo worth it.    When I found out I was pregnant, I told myself NO JUNK only fruits and veggies, and that lasted maybe a month or two, then it was Taco Bell and 7-11 hot dogs!!!      You have to eat, you can not just not eat, you will kill the baby!!  DER!! You just have to try to find the combination of foods that work for you, also you can use Pepto Bismul (ask your doctor first) but I have had friends who used it under their doctors care in moderation to help with nausea.|`|dDVAUA9saa	No sense in stressing yourself out over something that might not even happen to you.  Not everyone gets morning sickness.  I never had it with my first.  I had it with my second but not to the point of vomiting.  There is medication you can take for morning sickness if it gets that bad.  Many women lose weight during the first trimester due to morning sickness, nothing to worry about as long as you don't get dehydrated.|`|mbh3eex7aa	I am one of the lucky ones who does not have morning sickness. But there are many things you can do to help control it the main thing is to take your prenatal so the baby can still get the proper nutrition and to drink lots of fluids so you do not get dehydrated. Some people can learn how there morning sickness works. One of my friends who recently had a baby just ate very small meals frequently and it helped her control her morning sickness. But there are times when you try everything and nothing work. My best friend who is currently pregnant was sick for the first 10 weeks and tried everything to help her and nothing worked. But the doctor was able to give her a prescription to help with this.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	First, not everyone has morning sickness. I have only got sick a few times. I never had the daily vomiting that some people get so maybe you'll be a lucky one and not puke that much either!  Secondly, once you get pregnant, you will find strength to take care of that little baby you never knew you had.   Lastly, there were days that I got sick and that was it, I couldn't eat, but you'll get hungry soon, the baby will make sure of that and you just have to find that comfort food. That one thing that makes you feel better no matter how sick you were. For me it was jello, but not just any jello, I would put a pack of jello into a big cup and add 2 cups of really hot water and drink it like it was hot tea and that coated my stomach and took away any problems I had. There are still certain foods that I don't try to eat again, but you'll find other things to eat. Many people, like my sister, could only drink tea and eat dry toast through her entire pregnancy and she has a healthy 14 yr. old daughter.    You'll get through it!|`|MSngi4wHaa	not all women get sickness during pregnancy, but if u do just stay clear of the foods that turn your stomach.   Good luck anyway|`|qGQCLFinaa	I just got use to it really, and by that time it was over, it sucked big time but all i could think about as i was throwing up was the day i'll hold my baby in my arms, honestly it all boils down to everything i've ever gone through, good or bad has been worth it to see the smile on that little boys face everyday!  I would throw up for my whole pregnancy if i had to ;p honestly the morning sickness comes & goes differently for all women, maybe you'll get lucky & not have much morning sickness at all, but i think there are more things you should be worried about than vomiting if you want to get pregnant, they take blood often (i had a fear of needles & got over it FAST, by the end it was nothing) and giving birth was what i was worried about most, and that wasn't bad at all for me personally but i got lucky & had a great pregnancy, labor & birth.  But my next one could be way different.....  It's different for every woman & every pregnancy (as i hear from women who have multiple children), so i would honestly just suck up your fears (so to speak) and keep it in your mind that you can do this!! if you want a baby that bad, you're going to have to get over it!  I wish you the best of luck!|`|6EnQYZEOaa	Every woman is different I never threw up i just got nausea I ate a lot of crackers and for the first month or two I couldn't eat solid foods I ate like pudding,jello,etc. it went away
h5OYD8TIaa	That's great that you are educating yourself prior to starting a family.    That is a great start, and that's exactly what I did.  I asked tons of    questions.    This is my first pregnancy, and I did not know I was pregnant until I was nauseated and a Whopper Sandwich just disgusted me, then I took a pregnancy test, and it was positive.  That was my first nauseous spell.    AND that was at 6 weeks!  I was almost afraid I wasn't pregnant because I really didn't have morning sickness.  But not everyone experiences morning sickness.     I'm 9 weeks, don't have morning sickness at all.  Just nauseated at times, and it is very tolerable.        I have found that if I am nauseated, I have to eat to settle my stomach.      I NO longer think about myself, I think about my growing baby inside of me.  You and your baby are the priority now.  Your motherly instincts will kick in, and you will end up eating......TRUST ME, I hate to eat when I'm sick, but now that I am pregnant, my entire point of view totally changes. And I used to be like u, before I became pregnant  when I get sick, I do not put anything in my mouth.       I am very tired and very hungry!  I crave a lot of fruits and vegetables, and To be honest with you, my diet now is a lot more nutritious and healthier now than it was before I was pregnant.  I never ate fruit or vegetables before my pregnancy.    My husband massages me to keep me relaxed during my pregnancy.  I also pray.  I pray that God gives me a safe and healthy pregnancy, and I pray for my baby.     Exercise (walking) relaxes me also.    Take care!    PS DON"T be afraid of the unknown!  It won't be as bad as you think it is.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	Not all pregnant women get morning sickness when I was pregnant with my daughter I was horribly sick and throwing up all the time with this pregnancy  I feel okay most of the time but I do have times I feel nauseus, but dont actually throw up. Morning sickness fortunately does not last forever and although there will  be things that make u sick there will be things that dont and thats what u will end up eating so I wouldnt worry about it.|`|fG7LmB7Kaa	Well for one not all women experience morning sickness you could be one of the lucky ones like me (only 3/4 of pregnant woment experience morning sickness). I am actually sick of eating i have been constantly hungry since 6 weeks. It gets really hard trying to be healthy but really what gets you through all the tough stuff is just thinking i'm doing all this for my unborn. Really your mind set changes so fast after finding out you are bringing a child into this world, you would really do anything for them and you are in constant worry for there life and health not fear or disgust what it's doing to you body. Best of luck to you|`|W0d6NsGBaa	First of all you cant just NOT eat. We do it because its healthy for our babies. I was sick and threw up every day for almost 9 weeks. I would throw up in the morning and just be on with my day. You need to realize that when your pregnant its not about you anymore! You eat not because your hungry but because your baby needs you to eat to survive! Even if you throw up right after! Pregnancy can be a very very hard 40 weeks but it doesnt last forever. Its all for a greater cause. I wouldn't get pregnant until you are totally ready for ALL that pregnancy brings! its much easier to get through the 40 weeks and if you TOTALLY up for it.|`|fHgbL046aa	I have Panic Attacks and they can be brought on by a number of things,and puking is one of them. I am 16 weeks pregnant and I was nausea's from the first month to 15 weeks. I never puked I just felt sick. By the 15 week I was fine, but now I don't even feel pregnant. I'm still waiting for the baby to kick me. Pregnancy is scary,but if a baby is what you want you just go through it.   Besides some people don't even get sick. You could be one of the lucky ones.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	Hopefully you will be one of the lucky few that doesn't have morning sickness!    If you do have morning sickness, it's just something that you learn to deal with.  There are so many tricks that can help with morning sickness.  But really, It's all about finding the one that works best for you and your body.    There are going to be certain foods that will repulse you...even if you have eaten it or loved it before.  But there are also going to be certain foods that you could eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner without a problem.    The main thing to realize is that every single person is different and each person has to find their personal solution..    Good luck to you!|`|fec437cc10865a2198816c7d894542a6aa	I just had a baby four months ago and experienced quite a lot of sickness at first.  To be totally honest, the sickness you feel is a lot different than the nausea you're used to.  For me, it wasn't like having the flu because I wasn't feverish and felt fine.  But a couple times a day I would feel the need to be sick and it was over with very quickly.  So much so that it didn't even turn me off of the foods I was eating like it can with food poisoning.  It's very different in that respect.  Plus, the VAST majority of women stop feeling sick after the first trimester so it's only a few months.  You never know, there are lots of women who don't feel sick at all so you might be one of the lucky ones!!    good luck!    :)|`|ANsznbWsaa	Morning sickness varies for every person. Some never have it at all, some have it severely. I had what I call All Day Sickness, but I only ever threw up a couple of times. There are plenty of remedies to ease mild nausea safe for pregnancy, and designed for pregnancy. Of all the things we have to go through, don't let something small as morning sickness throw you off.|`|YK8P5rNXaa	Well im on my 3rd pregnancy and i never had morning sickness with this pregnancy and my other two and i always feel good and i feel about the same i just have a baby in my belly that's it....Well with all my pregnancy's i eat what ever i want and i have healthy babies who went home from the hospital the day after i had them and they only get sick once a year..... But my pregnancies are good and healthy and easy i love being pregnant.....|`|JMrtn0Fkaa	I had a pretty rough first trimester. Im not sure anyone out there is a fan of vomiting either. Its just something that happens when you decide to grow a life. I really didnt worry about staying healthy those first few weeks, I just worried about keeping food down and my doctor agreed fully. Just eat what you can till your poor tummy is ready to settle and take what you give it.   2nd trimester was MUCh better. My energy came roaring back and most of the time I didnt even feel pregnant..aside from the ever expanding midsection.  Now that Im in my thrid trimester I feel like Ive hit the wall. Im tired and hungry... all the time. I just eat apples in between meals cause I got a little ahead of myself with the weight gain in the 2nd and need to be careful now.    A lil advise... take all that 'What to Expect' stuff with a grain of salt. I was scaring the **** out of myself with the 'what ifs' after reading all of the things possible while pregnant. My doctor even told me to lay off that **** for a bit. i advise you to do the same. Stay informed but dont go crazy...its hard but in the end a less stressed mama is better for the baby.    Good Luck !!!|`|d6dzoHvvaa	I am currently 13 weeks pregnant and hopefully finally out of the morning sickness stage, it has been rough for me, some people get it bad and others are lucky and don't get any sickness. I Had it probably off and on from like 6 weeks up until now. I drank a lot of liquids to keep myself dehydrated and crackers helped with the morning sickness. I pretty much had to keep food in my stomach constantly in order to not get sick.
zUZRPmYAaa	Yes, you can, many factors can occur but still get it checked out.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	You need to take a test to make sure  IF you are, you need to go to the police, so they knew what happened    I missed my period for three months, I thought it was due to stress, due to my husband death.  I was wrong.  Something was wrong, and I almost died    You need to see a doctor for blood work  Your ob/gym or your PC could get the blood work you need  They need to check several things    You need to see a doctor, if it does not come soon    Since you have no clue on that night, take a pregnancy test, use the first urine of the day.  I hope you are not pregnant|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	I had the same problem but I was not pregnant so i went to the ob/gyn and she told me that if i was over 200lbs that you would have a irregular period but i wasnt over 200lbs so she said that it was just the way my body was.|`|NxNrZksXaa	period's can be unpredictable, so you could be experiencing an irregular period. if you don't get one in the next few weeks then you may need to see a doctor because it could be more than just an irregular period.
AA12324049	While no one can say for sure whether you are prenant, the fact that you last had unprotected sex the day before your period may have been your lucky break as it is the least likely time of the month you could get pregnant.  I think the symptoms you are describing are likely being manifested from nerves because you are worried you may be pregnant.  In my experience, the first symptom I had was tender breasts followed by horrible morning sickness at six weeks.  Take a pregnancy test just to be sure and if it is negative, please don't have sex again until you get some protection!  At the very least, you should use condoms, though they do have a failure rate of between 11% - 17% so they are not the best form of protection (but definitely better than nothing).  The best forms of birth control are the pill or an iud.  I'm not lecturing but if you don't want to go through all of this worry and stress every month and possibly end up with a baby you're not planning for, the best solution is to prevent it.  Good luck!    P.S. And you are right about the fact that you can get pregnant even if he pulls out due to preejaculate.|`|JGOeJOFDaa	Any unprotected sex can lead to pregnancy, even if he did pull out.  TAKE A TEST!|`|kdPPQIBfaa	probs

TvYX1yXWaa	i changed my son to gent lease cause he had alot of gas and was fussy and it did help him alot|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	my son was on similac sensitive which worked great but WIC in NY only covers Enfamil so now hes going to be on Enfamil Gentlease as of tommorrow when hes done with his similac can.  i would talk with his doctor before switching his formula.|`|tmh42R6Caa	It could be the formula.  Does he seem uncomfortable?  If he's not unhappy, you can probably stay on the Lipil.  I believe it's cheaper than the Gentlease.  However, if he's uncomfortable due to the gas, then switching might be best.|`|TqOdbhNAaa	I switched my daughter from Similac Advance to the Sensitive.  This is comparable to the Enfamil and Gentlease.  Make sure you give it a few days after switching to make sure there are no problems.  It can take up to two weeks for your baby to get used to the new formula.  Also, try not to go the soy route unless you've talked to your doctor.  Well, you should talk to your doctor before any change, but it's not a problem to switch.  My daughter did amazingly well once we switched her to the Sensitive, so good luck and I hope it helps!|`|mgLb5Yohaa	YES! I tried Enfamil Lipil AR in the beginning, and noticed my baby was awfully gassy and spitting up, and I took a chance and changed to Gentlease...night and day difference! He's 3 months old, and has been on Gentlease for a little over a month, and no more spitting up, or gas pains. The Gentlease breaks the milk protein further down, and removes some of the lactose, a main cause of digestive intolerance to the immature systems. I also talked this over with my Pediatrician regarding the change, she encouraged me to change his formula.    I am a believer in this change, my little guy appears to be a lot more comfortable after meals!    I wish you the best, darling!|`|jVhWIDRnaa	My baby was having the same problem so we put her on Gentlease. It has really helped her-she is a lot more happier.     Good luck!

I was all up front and was told that is how you carry if its a girl,but (everyone is different).  I am 16 weeks pregnant with my second and I have a feeling its a boy. I just know it is and I wanna girl. My boyfriend doesn't care what gender it is as long as its either a boy or girl LOL. I'm showing a bit in the belly but can't tell if I'll be up front or all around.  Silly old wives tails. I don't wanna know the gender of the baby until its born. There are very few surprises in life and I want this to be one of those surprises.|`|LZ6ZsqM3aa	I had a feeling I was having a girl. Other members thought it was a girl but I just knew.    And I was right. Had a scan at 22 weeks and found out Was having a girl. My partner was so happy as he had already had a son.|`|JDacwQ4Raa	I did.. mothers intuition is usually always correct.. Congrats.|`|fec437cc10865a2198816c7d894542a6aa	we kept ours a surprise but i knew from day one i was having a girl.  everyone said the 'old wives tales' pointed to me having a boy but i was right!!  now we have a beautiful baby girl...    :)|`|OTWx0RhCaa	Everyone kept saying I was having a boy but I knew I was having a girl. They were all coming up with boy names but I just knew! They were telling me the same thing about how it was a boy because of how the baby was positioned, my cravings, etc. Seven months later (she was early) out popped my little girl! Congrats on your little guy!|`|4YCsXqMDaa	well i thought i was having a boy and everyyyything pointed to a boy by old wives tales and then i ended up in the emergency room with some pain and the tech even told me i was having a boy.      but 4 weeks later i was getting and ultrasound and they said surprise its a girl!!!!!!( i guess the ER tech always gets the babys sex wrong) but there is no doubt about it...im def. having a girl lol|`|T9fek24eaa	I was so wrong on my "feeling" or guess on what I was having with my daughter. I just KNEW that she was a boy. Every one else kept saying girl and I just knew otherwise. Had the ultrasound and I was like ok where is his penis!? LOL! I was in denial. I was still worried about it all the way up until I gave birth because I just still felt that she was supposed to be a boy and surely with me buying all this pink stuff the baby would come out and be a boy... when she came out the first thing I asked was "Is she still a girl?" So I had the most wrong, mixed up feelings all the way up till I saw for myself. I am pregnant again and have a boy vibe this time too, so it must be another girl LOL!|`|O182rdRyaa	I thought i was having a boy, but it turned out to be a girl. lol but i am soo happy its a girl.|`|Xv7xz33laa	I was convinced I was having a boy, but had my 20 week scan last week and its a girl! I'm so happy and excited! My mum was right, l.o.l.    Stacey
QFNvYVtyaa	First off, having a late period and a negative test result is not necessarily a paradox. There are a few possible explanations. Indeed, in many cases there may be explanations other than pregnancy for why your period is late or has gone missing. There are also possible situations where a missed period is indeed caused by a pregnancy, and you nevertheless receive a negative pregnancy test result. Let's take a closer look at these two possible scenarios, and explore some of the possible causes.    Let's say that you have a missed period and have already noticed a few early pregnancy symptoms, etc, but your pregnancy test still tells you that you are not pregnant. What could be going on? Are you experiencing a "false negative pregnancy test"? If so, what causes false negatives?    Assuming that you are pregnant, the most simple explanation is that the test you have purchased from the drugstore is of a lower-sensitivity. This means that the test is capable of detecting pregnancy only when the level of hCG reaches a certain threshold, and the test is simply not sensitive enough to yield the positive result. Many test brands still ask you to wait at least until the first day of your missed period to test. One solution here it to simply use a more sensitive brand - and ensure that you follow certain pregnancy testing tips that will increase the accuracy of the tests by guaranteeing that the hCG level in a particular sample will be at its highest potential|`|DN6XtoViaa	a blood test would tell you for sure i think.  i'm kinda in your situation... i'm 3 days late, but i actually don't have symptoms at all and had a -hpt this morning.  i'm worried because i did have period symptoms on the day i should of started but now don't have any!?    anyways yes it can take some women a long time to get enough HCG lvls in your urine. some women actually never get enough!    Good luck! and hope you get your BFP very soon!
rDsKB0uXaa	See a Doctor|`|AA11981363	Are you burping him right? after every feed? You could also try some soy milk....Breastfeeding could also help solve this, his still new digestive system may be having a hard time digesting all that formula. Just my 2 cents.|`|3af544c64c1a18f83fe38882654d08e4aa	you need to go and see your gp he is the only onr who can help . good luck|`|vh7J9fFtaa	I'm a mother of five,I think you should ask your Dr. to check for acid reflux.If treated not a big deal,if not treated soon enough big problem.my newborn went un treated for two months and had to go to a childrens hospital for treatment.For some resoan they don't check for that.If your baby is spitting up during and after feedings,crying belly hurts it sounds like acid reflux.Lay your baby on it's belly it helps with the pain.I hope I have helped.|`|YW72TLapaa	I had to change my sons milk a few times, the first time we gave him Similac Sensitive and the first few days he was great then went back to having problems, he woudl be very fussy and cry when going to burp and constipated.  then we gave him Alimentum and he was great the first few days then developed Reflux.. it was horrible, he woudl eat fine but we could not leave him unattended for one minute cause the reflux came and he would be in pain and he woudl like stop breating for a second i was so horribly scared to leave him alone, my mom and i took turns always holding him up  never flat on his back or on his tummy.    the doctor gave me the ok to add cereal to his milk at 4 weeks , this helped a little , i also was feeding him every two hours on the dot to help reduce the reflux, he gave me zantac but the baby woudl spit it all up i tried different ways to give it ot him but it didnt work so i found Colic Calm and it did help a little but everyone just kept telling me that it woudl get better with time.  I did change his formula and he is perfect now.    what you need to do is call your pedi againa nd if he doesnt pay attention to you get another doctor (i changed mine twice until i found one who actually listened to me)  he might be lactose intolerant and be alllergic to milk protein.  have you tried Similac Alimentum? or Similac LActose free? u have to find the formula  thats right for your kid, my son didnt tolerate good start or efamil, but he takes the similac sensitive just fine.  Some doctors want you to stick to one brand of formula i think because the company pays them or something, i dont know,,,, but look for a doctor that listens to you.    if you feel it in your gutt that he is in pain then follow your gutt, you are only his mom ... who better than you to know if your son is sick or not?  i checked on the american association of pedriatricians, go online and research and again, take him to the doctor and insist that your son in in pain and you want him cheked out. If it is reflux he needs meds. In the meantime feed him in a quiet place, relaxed, burp him very frequently, and hold him up for at least 30 minutes after feeding. and do not move him too much, try to keep him as still as you can, i woudlnt let anyone hold him because they would move him too much and he would get stressed too...everytime we had people over and there was too much noise around him his symptoms were worse!  Good Luck and please popst and let us know what happened.
I4a8zI1gaa	This is a tough one.  My son suffered a severe reaction at his 4 months reaction from DTaP. But I know that a lot of the reactions come from the Pertussis.  Hib is typically very safe with minimal reactions except mild pain at injection site.      Defintiely take him in... but honestly, I think it may be something to do with him being traumatized by the shots.  Maybe he was so scared and in so much pain, and now he just wants you all the time because it hurt him.  IT possibly still is causing him some pain, so he is continuously reminded of it.      Could it maybe just be coincidentally his ears or teething?  Maybe he picked something up at the doctor's office?  I'm going to look into this more for you, but they are supposed to hold off giving vaccines if they're sick.  They're immune system is so much more susceptible to actually getting the disease theyre getting immunized for.      This just made me realize something - if he was sick - maybe it's related to that too?  Maybe it's moved into his stomach or something?  SOre throat?  Give him motrin and see if it helps him    EDIT:  TAKE HIM TO THE ER.. seriously.  if hes having a severe reaction like this - whether it's from the shots or not - constant crying warrants urgent care.  I'm saying prayers, keep us updated!|`|AXEqOEloaa	I will say I have a very strong opinion about vaccines but no here for debate, I just hope this is not an effect from the vaccines. Has he ever had any reactions to his past vaccines? And I think your dr should have waited  if your boy was indeed sick.  I hope he is ok.|`|qpbV2VyJaa	they're not supposed to give vaccinations when children are sick. their immune systems are so concentrated on the illness that their bodies don't know what to do with it. vaccines are only 'dead' forms of the disease.|`|SRuMAjSpaa	My 2 year old was the grumpiest grump, crying all the time also.  For her, it was because the area around the injection site was very bruised and extremely sore/sensitive from (her)muscle tension during the injection.    Oh, her fussiness went well into 3 days after receiving her vaccinations.  But you are very wise in seeking a second opinion.  Hope all turns out well for him!|`|YW72TLapaa	I can imagine how frustrated and scared u must feel..  my 2 month old had his first shots 3 days ago and like 3 hrs after he started crying inconsolably and i got so scared.. i called the docs office and the nurse told me to give him tylenol every 4 hrs and try warm baths and stuff.. thank god the tylenol worked wonders and he has been pretty much normal since then.  im not against the vaccines either but next time i will ask the doc to give him one vaccine at a time, instead of 3 at one shot.   My doctor did tell me that if the baby had a little cold or sick he would not vaccinate.  he must be in some kind of pain.   i hope he feels better and what you can do is ask the doctor ahead of time which vaccines he needs and how many and try giving him tylenol before the shots.  Good Luck|`|tmh42R6Caa	I don't have any personal experience, but I know that all vaccines have side-effects.  Could he have a fever?  I think fever, diarrhea, etc are common side effects of vaccines.  I would go ahead with your checkup to see what's giong on, but don't worry too much.  Read up on side effects of HepB shots and see if it matches what's going on with you son.  It's probably nothing to worry about.|`|qStmw7qgaa	Well the hep. B shot hurts.  My 2 month old just got her 2nd one, and the area where she was injected was really soar.  She was really fussy for a few days after also.  It could be he is just out of sorts from the shot.  But it's good that he is going to the pedi.
b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Well honestly there is not enough info here.  If you have had intercourse with out protection there is always a chance that you could be pg.  I would wait till you have missed a period to take a test.|`|eemmWU0Haa	Im due to start my period on the 2nd of Feb as well I gave in this morning and took a dollar test it was negative. I'm going to wait until I actually miss my period to take another test.|`|xxaFwwBgaa	try taken the test... but period do get irregular after you stop any kinda birth control ..be safe take the test .. be safer for the baby if you are so you can get your prego pills
kprKXEOSaa	You need to see a psychiatrist.  It's not arachnophobia, that's fear of spiders.  It's not agoraphobia, that's fear of being out in public.  It's not pyrophobia, that's fear of fire.  A "fear of having too many sperm in your body" well, that might be a new one, maybe they'll name it after you.|`|HTkGvWYAaa	it's called masterbating...stop using master bathing|`|ehvzQRkkaa	Self control?|`|xpstigPTaa	oh my lord|`|AA11210405	Wow.  Go ahead and keep master bathing..... that way you won't be with a woman and you won't be given the chance to reproduce....I think that would be for the best.|`|eemmWU0Haa	lol you sound like a packy dude!|`|CXN90i4Iaa	HAHAHAHAHAH dude........ its called self controll|`|gb8JpBLtaa	Have something to do with your life.  I wack it all day when I have nothing to do, but when I got work or studies, don't even have time to think about it.|`|RgNs6Tsdaa	I dont know the answer, but I think the term your trying to write is 'masterbate'....masterbathing sounds pretty different|`|zuZKj3xXaa	Ha haha.  Masterbathing?  Stop thinking DIRTY thoughts and it might STOP! lol  good luck little Buddy :)|`|qesRq5Aeaa	hahahahhahah. first of all just stop doing it and its masterbating
38fe66cc26fd24d41aff94bf6ba97574aa	I would definitely check with a lawyer.    Sorry and hang in there!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I would get a lawyer.
AA10167940	Doctor, Nurse, Medical Assistant CNA|`|xbISxnmfaa	Neonatal Nurse Practitioner  Ultrasound Technicians  You could teach Lamaze classes.  You could be a nutritionist for pregnant mothers.|`|Dhsyroekaa	a nurse.  they help with the baby and after to maek sure mom is ok|`|vue9NOhYaa	A nurse would be the obvious choice. You could work in an OB office.    Or you could become a doula. That mostly focuses on childbirth itself, but many doulas help during late pregnancy and during the post-partum weeks.    Or consider something like learning yoga or massage and specialize in working with pregnant moms.|`|fHgbL046aa	You could be a Doula. They support the mother during the birth.The course is not as long as nursing and it sounds pretty cool. You can check it out on Google.|`|r0M7gVP7aa	Ultrasound Technician   Neonatal Nurse   Labor and Delivery Nurse    Postpardum Nurse  Midwife (there are some who don't do births, but rather work doing Gynecology and Prenatal Visits)      Seeing births is an amazing thing! Before you really make sure you don't want to be anything that revolves around delivering babies, see a birth! I was like you, thinking I wanted to be a Labor and Delivery Nurse, not wanting to have to deliver a baby but then I saw two births one at a hospital and one at home and I decided I wanted to be a midwife.     Good luck! Happy to see there's someone else who wants to do something in pregnancy!
SRzswqTeaa	Well it just depends on the certifying organization and how many births you can get to meet those requirements.  Some have done it in a year or less.  You also need to consider the time limits given by each organization, and what they consider as a qualifying birth.  You need to research the various organizations and see which one fits your philosophy the best.  Here are a few certifying organizations, but there are many more!  (Each organization has their own reading list, their own philosophies, birth requirements, prices etc)..    http://alace.org/   http://dona.org/  http://childbirthinternational.com/  http://cappa.net/  http://birtharts.com/      I'd like to tell you that this is not a career in which you can expect to make a decent, and steady income.  There may be months where you do not even have any clients for a long time until you are well established.  It is also not a good idea to have more than two clients in a month without a backup doula.   But if you want a good side income, and you love birth - you'll love it!          If you would like, you can IM me (yahoo IM labordoula4u), or email me if you would like to chat about this.
hgbfzGSMaa	You can't just throw your hands up, walk away and declare that this child is not your problem anymore!    In the state that I live in (and I think most states are like this), a parent CAN NOT sign away parental rights and be released from child support obligations unless the other parent has a suitable person adopting the child in question.  That's because this child is then being supported by only one parent.  This means that if mom applies for state aid, the taxpayers are then helping to foot the bill, all because somebody who has a responsiblity to financially support this child didn't WANT to.  As a taxpayer, I say to YOU...this isn't my baby, it's YOURS.  I take care of mine, you take care of yours...sound FAIR?  I think so.    Be a man and take care of your child!    REGARDING YOUR EDIT:  Your recourse is to contact an attorney and start Paternity proceedings.  The Court could then order a DNA test, and custody and visitation rights would be established and on paper.  Then you could see your child, and know for a fact that this child is yours.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	IF, and only IF your state will allow you to sign over your rights, then child support will stop.    It really depends on your states laws.  Here, someone would have to be willing to adopt my son and take over responsibility before they will allow my son's father to sign over rights.  If that were to happen, he wouldn't have to pay child support anymore.    You need to talk to a lawyer to get the correct information in regards to where you live.|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	You can buy your way out of child support and sign away your rights but unless the mother signs a statement saying you don't have to pay, then you will pay until the child's 18th birthday.     It's only fair.... the child didn't ask you to bring them into this world and it is your responsibility to make sure he/she has everything they need.|`|wENdWT5kaa	You can sign away your rights, but you STILL have to pay child support. The only way you can stop paying is when the child is 18 years old.     Sorry, guess you are going to have to grow up and become a MAN.|`|158e8f51e731e93ad7f2eb5b83dc2c28aa	Even if you sign away your rights, you'll still have to pay child support...it's still your child!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i think either way you still have to pay child support. you'll haev to check out the laws in your state.|`|a0e64779677c884ea4ca4c17390ea954aa	Wow is blue eyes your ex?  You need to speak to an attorney you are due a paternity test.  It is a part of the law.|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	lol. silly boy, you can't do that. Especially if your name and dna are all of "this childs" who i'm sure has a name and you are just being ignorant and not using it.    You made the baby/child/kid, and how can you neglect and walk away from that?    Better man up fella! Cuz the baby is yours for the rest of your life whether you like it or not!|`|fPX1lD8uaa	This is your child, your blood.... and you can just sign away your rights, walk away and never see him or her again?  How can you can make a baby, and walk away forever?  Don't you want to know your child and have your child know you.  I think if you do what you are saying, that you will regret it for the rest of your life.        Please think long and hard before making this decision.  Not just for you, but for your baby.|`|mGU0h3O3aa	Wow.. How about you take care of the child you created? Instead of walking away from it! I'm sure this child will love to grow up to find out their dad didn't want anything to do with them.     So selfish..|`|AXEqOEloaa	I think the only way you can get away without paying child support is if the other parent agrees to the terms and that parent cannot be on any public assistance or for sure child support will track you down. But why would you want to do that anyway, you would really give up your child just to not pay? That really is sad and really shows that you are a true coward. But in the long run maybe the child would be better without someone like you in their life.|`|7uVlYPEIaa	If you sign away your rights so another person can adopt the child, like a step parent, then yes child support can be ended. We are actually looking at doing it with my step sons. Her 150 dollars a month isn't needed, and she hasn't seen them in 7 years anyway. She still pays semi-faithfully, but it is more important to us that if something were to happen to my husband that I would gain custody of them, not that they would have to go live with her.    I would say just make sure it is what you want to do. Also think of the child and what it will mean to them. Will they be hurt by you not wanting to be there for them anymore? The courts will not allow you to sign over rights without the consent of the other parent just so you don't have to pay support.    Edit: In most states if you sign the birth certificate then you are committing to that child, regardless of DNA. If you were uncertain whether she was yours then you shouldn't of signed on the line. Unless she coerced you into believing it was yours, then you really have no case to get a DNA test done. Go to a family lawyer. If you are court ordered for visitation and she is denying you then she has been in contempt of court and you need to figure out which way you want to go with it, either tell her to sign the paper work to sign over your rights, or get her in trouble for the contempt.|`|WfpUUX2Iaa	In my own experiences with the family court system. It was ordered my ex take a paternity test and he had a time limit (we did) he had to pay for it because he was the one who petitioned for it. I think it's probably a bad idea to terminate your parental rights, because you don't know if your child is actually yours or not. Terminating your right is the absolute end. I would definitly go back to court explain to the judge that your ex has neglected to get the DNA testing. He will force her to!  GL in whatever you decide
mbprjCSiaa	i love the name penelope or addison|`|YYAu9lFDaa	Danielle over Allison|`|9iXGakohaa	I love Abigail and Danielle. Alyssa is a cute name too, but there isn't a nickname that will come easy with that (Lyss, Lyssie?) so that goes against what you wanted.     My least favorite is Jordan. It's cute but it's a little to popular for me if you know what I mean?|`|7SKVCPcSaa	a love abigail for a little girl|`|xrJqmRFqaa	I like Allison (although I would suggest spelling the nickname Allie.

bAp35x7uaa	Sorry to hear that.  I haven't had trichomonas, but found this article which may put your mind at rest; it confirms what your doc said treatment in the second trimester.    Good luck xx    http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/ate/pregnancy...|`|5puE2Qfpaa	I had a friend that was in the same situation. Your doctor knows best. That basically is a bacteria infection. You can get it from douching. Yes, you will be ok until 2nd trimester and if you have a reaction to the med. there is other meds. You will be fine. Docs, know what can wait or not. ( trich- can also come from sex yes, by different bacteria from sex partners)
fE5zMOfJaa	Nope!  You're stuck!  Should've thought about that before!  Sorry but it's true!  People today just think sex is no big deal but you personally know that's not the case huh?  Hopefully this will get you to think a little harder next time....and w/ your mind not your junk!  If you're not in love w/ her then obviously you won't be taking care of the baby, she will.  You'll just have to send her a check every month.  She was irresponsible too to get pregnant, but at least she's making the responsible choice to keep it.  Hopefully you will make the responsible choice too & step up to help out.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	Man up and take responsibility.|`|r2EBoqyiaa	Not been funny love but it takes two to tango and you must no the risks wen having unprotected sex all av to say is that u should stand up and be a man and face your responsibilities !!!|`|Dn251zLyaa	If you weren't ready to have a child, you shouldn't have had sex.  You need to step up and be a man and care for your child.  Don't be a pr*ck.|`|NxNrZksXaa	nope! it's her decision to have it or not. so why not take the option of just accepting YOUR mistake, grow up, and deal with it. you're the one who let your little army inside her. next time use protection or pull out (even though they're def not 100% effective)|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	Here's an idea...Grow up. You had to know that having sex with this girl could potentially lead to a baby, that's how they are made! So, step up to the plate and be a man. You had sex, now deal with the consequences.|`|fPX1lD8uaa	Sorry buddy, I think your gonna just have to get used to the idea that your going to be a daddy.|`|eemmWU0Haa	ha-ha sucks 2 b u boo...You got yourself into this mess and your going to stay in it, she didn't get pregnant on her own and takes two and if you bail out now your a coward. Mistakes happen honey!  Why don't you just support her she needs you!
Mq9LeKfuaa	if they scraped your cervix it could be anytime now. losing your mucus plug just means that your cervix is now open to allow the baby to come down and your body ready for the labor process. you could go in a few hours or in a few days. but if you do start cramping in stomach or in the middle lower part of your back then most likely the labor process is beginning:)   wishing you a safe delivery and healthy baby good luck!!|`|AA12107422	Ah. The dreadful wait. My sister in law had her 'membranes scrapped' around 38-39 weeks or so, she lost her mucus plug that night, & still had to be induced on her due date, she was 40 weeks. So that doesn't mean a thing. Everyone is different. I hope it means something for you though!! Good Luck -- & Congrats on the baby ?|`|j4lcMGmiaa	the mucus plug is a very tricky thing...I lost mine and went into labor two weeks later.  Some women lose there's and go into labor right away...its an indication that labor is near...but it may not be as near as you think it is...or it may be closer than you want...I know that's really not helping you...but I just wanted to give you some insight because I went crazy once I lost my mucus plug...and called the doctor's non stop...|`|r2EBoqyiaa	I Would probaly go to the hospital if you have lost your plug you maybe going in to labour or slow labour ?>|`|532XA7lkaa	You don't go to teh hospital when you lose your plug...it can happen up to 2-4 weeks before labor begins.  It's usually a process anyway...    I was induced with my first at 41 weeks.  I know how you feel...just ready to meet the little guy/girl!  When they rupture your membranes...I just want to let you know that it sounds much more painful than it actually is.  It is really non-invasive and not painful...just like a pelvic exam really.  They used a plastic hook to break my water...I was completely terrified, because I was in the hospital...we were inducing that day...and it did not hurt at all.  The tool scared me...but the process does not hurt.  And trust me...I'm a wimp!      You'll see that baby within the next 3-5 days!|`|AA11442702	sounds to me like theres a baby on the way. lol|`|AA10624543	It can be a week or it can be two hours.  I would monitor your "cramps" aka contractions.  If they get consist ant say every 10 minutes you may want to think about going in.  If you get up and walk and they go away, you still have time.
0ebeadfc05507c25a34209b1ae74798aaa	I found out yesterday and I'm beyong exited. It took us 8 long months of many disappointments. It still hasn't registered with me yet. I just hope that I carry my mini me full terms    5 wks|`|3DI0ZJS5aa	You sound like your going to be a wonderful mum! It's great to hear about someone so excited about there pregnancy!    I'm 22 and found out last week that i'm pregnant - i'm 6 weeks tomorrow. I was very shocked when I got a positive result but am very pleased. I had two years of negative results! I am super excited but still a little nervous! - Yay for us!    P.S - this is my first pregnancy too!|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Well done.  It is the most exciting thing ever,|`|yznZqcznaa	Im 26 soon to be 27.

My husband and I have a 19 month old son, so we are happy to now be expecting a girl (however our son doesnt seem to like all the pink stuff)|`|EAzyjftKaa	I couldn't believe what the doctor was saying i had a shocking moment i was there to get a procedure done ( pelvic something i forget) she did the routine check possibilities of preg well no that's why i'm here, So she said i will test just as procedure i said don't waist a preg test on someone who can't get preg. she did and she said hold on it's broken let me re test i said ther is no need so she did and she said CONGRATULATIONS  for what i said YOU ARE PREGNANT i couldn't believe i had her repeat it 2- 3 times, i call my boyfriend at the time know my husband and tears just drop and off course my next question was so how long am I . I knew i hadn't had a period for a while which was pretty normal for me. She said about 8.3 weeks i was so exited o by da way this was Dec 28, 2005 and i was 20 years old. They gave me a due date of July 23. On my next apt. there was no heartbeat and i had an ultrasound done, just to find out i was 8.6 weeks preg not 12.5 weeks that the doctor said. My new dd was Sept. 4 My husband was Sept. 6 and mine Sept. 22 i went to labor on Sept 6 and deliver Sept 7 a perfect little girl.|`|NxNrZksXaa	i'm 19 too and i think (hope) i am! so far i'm a few days late, but AF loves to trick me :(   blow some baby dust for me & my fiance!    congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!|`|eemmWU0Haa	The first time I ever got pregnant I was 14 years old and I was scared sh!tless I didn't know what to do   4 months later I lost the baby, this may sound stupid now but honest to God I was so frigging happy that I wasn't pregnant anymore, like frig I was 14 years old and on the pill..  Now I really want to get pregnant and its not happening for me I've had many miscarriages and it doesn't wanna stick..|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I was 21 and very, very excited as well.  Now that we know its twins, we are even more thrilled.  However, I have been sick in bed for over two months now and am absolutely miserable.  I was so much happier before when I could actually eat and go out and do things like a normal person!  Now I'm getting a little depressed but am hoping I will feel better soon.  Hopefully you have a more enjoyable pregnancy!|`|r2EBoqyiaa	I am 21 and just recently found out that am 6 weeks pregnant I was over the moon as I had been trying for a baby for 6 months with my partner|`|eU5Eth2aaa	My husband and I are both 21 and we found out a couple of months ago.    We were very excited and a bit shocked that it happened so fast for us!  We both wanted to be younger parents and we felt so blessed that God gave us this opportunity!    Good luck to you as you begin your pregnancy journey!  :)|`|9b36cd20c83580627b271744d6046be0aa	The first time, I was 19-going to be 20 in  a month, and my boyfriend was 24, my boyfriend and I got engaged at Christmas and we decided in January to start trying to get pregnant. We thought it would take a couple months...my periods were irregular, so we just started having sex without protection. Well 2 weeks after we started, I missed my period and I thought nothing of it because I was irregular anyway...but I took a test and it was positive! We were both REALLY excited! Surprised it happened so fast, but really happy. With my second one my periods were still irregular and it took 2 years to get pregnant. My now husband was sleeping and it was like 3 weeks after I was supposed to get my period, but again, I didn't think anything of it because I was still irregular and every month for the past 2 years I was taking tests-I should have bought stock in them I bought so many-I decided to take one right after I woke up in the morning, thinking, okay, another day with a negative pregnancy test...but when I looked at it I was in shock because it said positive. I just couldn't believe it! My husband is usually really hard to wake up, but I went in there and said that it was positive and he just jumped right out of bed and we started screaming! I was 24 and he was 29 for our second baby.|`|KPuDlWFiaa	i'm 24 and i was over the moon as my lil man was planned conceived after a month of coming off the pill!! cant wait for him to be here :-)  (my first)|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	To be honest, when i first found out i was pregnant, i was petrified. I've suffered 3 miscarriages, so i was scared of it happening again. As i got further along my excitement grew. I'm now 32 weeks, 2 days into a twin pregnancy, and excitement doesn't cover it! I cannot wait to meet my babies. I've suffered a lot with this pregnancy, as the symptoms and pains are awful.. but i still wouldnt change it for the world. I love feeling my babies move, poke and kick inside me, and i'm addicted to my doppler as hearing their heartbeats is very soothing! I haven't completely enjoyed being pregnant, but for the most part i love it, and know when i'm not, and can actually see my own feet again, i'll probably miss it!|`|qB9pFqmUaa	guys will never find out they are pregnant !|`|FeMJDEcIaa	I am 21, turning 22 in a month and I am 7 months pregnant.  I couldn't be happier either, I figured out I was pregnant about 4/5 months along.|`|rl1IITqRaa	I felt scared and shocked but eventually verrrrrry happy.

ifUB8Zziaa	i had a planned c-section with my daughter 7 months ago and i had no problems though my pregnancy at all, i had the section because she was breech, they took her out 1 week before she was due, they don't wait until your in labour because this is classed as an emergency   c- section and hospitals try to avoid this at all costs. as for the weight its just an estimate it could be plus or minus 25% but as far as i remember my daughter was 3lb odd at this time she was born 7lb 8oz. don't worry about it|`|pXSKSS3daa	I am not sure how big he was at that point but I was measuring ahead of where I was at. I think I was measuring 32 weeks at 28 weeks.    Your baby has PLENTY of time to turn head down. Most babies don't until closer to 34-36 weeks anyway, so I wouldn't be worrying about a C-section this early. And, no, you won't go earlier if you need to have a C-section. Your doctor won't even talk about a C-section until you're in labor and they see which way the baby is facing.    The only time C-sections are performed earlier are 1) if they are scheduled ones(these are usually reserved for mothers that have had previous C-sections or if mother and/or baby is having complications and doctors figure the baby would be better off outside the womb than inside).|`|awRNr2VMaa	it depends on your doctor usually you go around 38 or 39 weeks for a c section bc of the risk you could go into labor and be too far into it to do the section. the 3lbs is just an estimate could weigh more or less and sounds perfectly fine to me =)
AA12123844	DO NOT take castor oil...been there done that, it only made me sit on the potty all freaking night!!!!!! It is just an old wives tale and doesnt work, I am 35 weeks and would give anything to go into labor RIGHT NOW as I am so freaking uncomfortable but even though I AM READY my baby isnt so I just gotta bite the bullet and hang on a lil longer....look at it this way, we have already come further than the amount of time we still have to go.....babies come when they are ready and if it doesnt come before you are induced let it be and let the docs do what they do best, you dont wanna take any silly chances and possibly harm that lil one, so just hang in there....Sunday isnt that far away and you really dont wanna have runny bowels when they are trying to induce now do you? fecal matter has lots of bacteria and you dont want that to complicate matters when they do induce....if I were you, and I wish I was cuz I still have a few weeks to go, I would spend time plugging up outlets installing those lil things on cabinets to prevent toddlers from opening them, wind up all lose cords, wash all those cute brand new outfits do the things now that you know you wont have time or energy for when that lil bundle of joy comes! Get things ready for the babys room, baby book, start making things practical and within reach for when you come home with that lil baby, or do like me, get on the computer and offer words of hope and incouragement to others in our predicaments and before you know it Sunday will be here! Congrats to you and good luck!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	do not take castro oil!! or even caster oil :P  let them do it they know what they doing u may end up just making urself really ill not what u gonna want when baby voming at all|`|42L4T1Zsaa	I tried castro oil before I was induced with my son. It was disgusting, and it didn't help at all. So unless you feel that it will help,  I wouldn't do it. It's gross.|`|JhcOeplZaa	If I where you I'd wait and get induced. Castro oil will make you so sick if he/she is not ready to come out.  Congratulations! and Good Luck!|`|afW58le8aa	Castor oil doesn't work.  At the best it will make you sick and clean out your bowels.  Just wait to get induced and if your baby is ready it will come before then.  Your doctors know what they are doing and so if they are inducing then that is what they see is best for you.  If you want to do the castor oil thing it won't hurt but it won't help and it tastes really gross!|`|mgLb5Yohaa	Castor oil can be quite...messy. If you've never taken castor oil orally, you don't know how your body may react. It can cause severe cramping, uncontrollable diarhhea, and can cause the unborn baby distress if not taken in appropriate amounts.     I would get to walking, sister! Walk, walk, walk! Some sex with the hubby/boyfriend can also get those going!    Try to avoid the castor oil route, sugar, that may cause more grievance than results.    I wish you the best with your upcoming arrivial! Many blessings to you!
giEXhSTIaa	I couldn't have put it better myself. Well done girl! :D x|`|mTyu7CKoaa	I had my son at 18, about 15 days after I walked at graduation.... u should see how it feels to have about 2,000 people watch u walk (graduation) and all give u the same look... But I was happy and I got my son and hes my world.... so honestly how cares what people think... Im never going to have to see them again|`|532XA7lkaa	We shouldn't judge anyone, that is correct...it is however, human nature to judge.  It's actually a protection mechanism believe it or not!  I think pregnant teens get a bad rap because, generally...and I mean that, teens are more selfish and immature in nature because their brains are still underdeveloped.  There is actually science to this!  It is not right though for people to be mean or offensive to the brave teens that choose life...thank God!...and decide to go it alone.  As adults with children, they know how hard it is on them...fully developed brained people...and they can't imagine how a teen could possibly do it.  That's the truth of it.    With that being said, getting pregnant does not make you a mother or father.  Any female can get pregnant.  Fish get pregnant.  Dogs get pregnant.  Cats get pregnant.  What's hard is being a mother...being a mother means putting yourself aside for awhile and dedicating your life to someone elses.  This can be difficult for teens...especially since their lives haven't been that long...they haven't had the appropriate time to be selfish, which is part of our brains development.  Babies are the most selfish creatures you will ever meet...and this often clashes.  However, there are plenty of great teen mothers that have made sacrifices and are just gifts to their children.  It's great that you support your friend...the mark of a true friend will be if she gets that support in the middle of the night when she hasn't slept for 36 hours and he baby is vomiting, has a fever and won't eat.  Or when she quits showering and caring about herself and smells like Desitin and baby poop for weeks on end.  Or when she has to find babysitters because the baby is sick and she has to work or she'll get fired.  Those are the times she will need you most.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	First of all, its one thing to have an accident but quite honestly I am sick of seeing questions about a 15 year old CHILD asking how come she isn't getting pregnant. Some young girls use abortion as birth control and that is insane. Young girls are having WAYYY 2 much unprotected sex.I am not an unreasonable person but there comes a point where enough is enough. If your going to have sex use protection. What are you going to do when your exposed to HIV or HEPB or MRSA. all of these infections you can very much get from sexual contact. MRSA isn't nec. a STD but yes you can get it from bodily contact with the sore. If I were you I would focus on what you want to do when you grow up. Plan on a career that you can be a proud independent women. Not trying to play house at such a young age.        EDIT: its one thing to be 18 but we are talking about 12 and 13 year old girls trying to get pregnant. Its actually very sad....|`|j4lcMGmiaa	Its not a judgment thing.  I am a 24 year old single mother to 5 month old twins...and I adore them.  I have the means to take care of them, and the emotional stability.  Not everyone my age or older has that...and yes there are some people younger than me that have that ability.  The problem is most of the time that's not the case.  When a teenager becomes pregnant and they have a supportive family a lot of the responsibility falls upon the supportive family.  A teenager who decides on there own to get pregnant needs to be prepared to finish school, and in this economy further there education, and get a good paying job with insurance to support there child and themselves.  That's a lot to take on.  Especially when I can honestly say from the age of 10 - 24 I am a completely different person...I am different now then I was a year ago...way different then I was when I was 18...and light years away from the immature person I was when I was 16...now I know all teenagers feel like we adults don't know what we are talking about...but have a baby at 16 and when you are 26 with a 10 year old and you still feel the same way about teenage pregnancy then more power to you...but for some odd reason I don't think you will.|`|4Z3oIc3Raa	As a teenager people are not ready to take proper care of a child. That is why people judge. However I do wish for the best.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	i feel the same im sick of ppl looking down at young girls  some of these young mums put the mature ones to shame  age has NOTHING to do with how good a parent u can be|`|AA12107422	Well, its just an aspect in life that happens, people have & will always judge. Its hard not to, but it happens. Doesn't mean they think the person is a bad person. I know people judge me & my life, but I don't mind it, cause I probably do the same. Its not fair, but it happens. I think you are doing a great thing by staying by your best friend at a time like this, its going to change her life forever. & I am assuming people judge young mothers because majority of them don't take full responsiblity to take care of the baby, but that's not fair because not all teen mothers are like that, like your friend for instance. Good Luck & Congrats to your friend ?|`|6eGZGEw4aa	I don't judge teens that are pregnant. I just don't agree with teens that get pregnant and COMPLAIN to everyone that they got pregnant because they were being irresponsible and weren't mature enough to actually THINK about what they were doing.    It's not fair to the baby or to the others affected by her.|`|Dhsyroekaa	because they think about that poor baby life that you will ruin. Your not even an adult an expect to raise to kid? Do you have a vehical? a house? a svings? a job?   Teenagers seem to rely on their paremts and dont even consider the cost of a baby. And at a young age the dad will skip out to party because he doesnt want to be tied down.|`|a3MSSvdcaa	I don't respect the teenagers who purposely get pregnant.  I also don't really respect the teenagers who get pregnant mulitple times when they're young.  I don't respect the teenagers who slept with mulitple guys and don't know the father of their child.    But accidents happen and I can respect those teenagers....and the ones who actually step-up and accept the responsibility like getting a job and making sure they finish school.|`|RgO3Sn38aa	Is there anyone who gives any thought about the baby anymore?  Is it all about selfishness?  How will the baby be raised?  Where is the income coming from?  Who is going to raise the baby while mommy is in school or working?  Will baby have a two parent family?  Where will baby go if something happens to mommy?  Foster care?    It's all well and good that someone stands by mommy when she's pregnant, but where will her friends and family be when the rubber meets the road?  Will our tax dollars be supporting your housing, car insurance, food stamps?  Where will daddy be?  Riding off to the sunset?  Or will miracles of miracles happen and he will actually marry you?  You really need to think about these things.  We have enough Caylee and Casey Anthony's in the world.|`|fE5zMOfJaa	Are you serious?!  Well...I guess that's a typical teenager's way of thinking.   Do you say that when a teenager gets a disease like HIV?  Because that's also a possibility when you have unprotected sex.  But you probably think that'll never happen right?  Maybe you should talk to people who did become pregnant when they were teenagers & see what they think now.  I'm sure they love their children more than anything...but I guarantee they will say they wish they would've waited.  And anyways....you're a freakin' teenager....you should not be having sex!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	" i always will be!?! " why the question mark?    people have a problem with it because these teen moms usually have to go on welfare, food stamps, and what ever else the government will put them on.. and then we worry about the teen and the baby.. who is taking care of them? are her parents going to support her AND  a baby? is she going to living on the street or in a shelter?     thats why people 'judge'.. its not really judging.. its just common sense and worry.|`|K7f3B4scaa	Well it just concerns me when young girls are having babies and they can't even spell simple words correctly. Besides, why rush it? Enjoy your youth, there is plenty of time to have a child. Go out and experience life, travel, meet new and interesting people, go bar hoping when you turn 21.....that's a little more difficult to do when you have a baby that is depending on you.
ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	It sounds like she is getting enough sleep.  If you increase naps she may start waking up at night.  Leave well enough alone.|`|pXSKSS3daa	If she isn't bothered by those napping times then I wouldn't bother trying to "fix" them.    You didn't say how old she is or how much she's sleeping during the night but some babies are cat nappers and can do well on a short amount of sleep during the day.|`|awRNr2VMaa	then dont worry about it unless you want to give her one nap a day. how old is she? if my son only takes one nap its about 3 hours but he usually takes 2 naps and they last about an hour to an hour and a half.|`|ZIdhNsxPaa	That's normal. No need to lengthen the time. If she needs more sleep she will sleep longer. You may notice when she starts teething and having growth spurts she'll sleep longer. My daughter slept 4 hours for a nap once due to teething.     If she doesn't seem crabby or tired, then that's fine for her. She probably gets very good rest at night and doesn't need all that much in the day. Every child is different.
EzkGVZ1Yaa	An Ultrasound is usually preformed between the 16th and 20th week of pregnancy. If there's any sign of problem it can be done as early as 7th week until the end of pregnancy.|`|gx4s68s8aa	I would say 30 weeks or after is great.  Don't do it before 24 weeks, because your baby will likely not have enough fat on the face to get a really great picture.  I have had 3D and 4D ultrasounds every 2 or 3 weeks since my 18 week since I am high risk.  I am almost 31 weeks and I had one yesterday.  Yesterday was by far the best as of yet.  The one three weeks ago was good, but not as good as yesterday's.  The image was very clear and a few pictures almost looked like a photograph of a newly born infant, instead of an ultrasound.  Likely my scan in two weeks will be just as good.    I wish I could tell you where to get yours.  But since I get my at my high risk doctor, I don't know for others.  But you will enjoy it.  Have fun.|`|SDjrojZXaa	between 28-32 weeks if you get it too soon the baby may look skelatal and you wont be able to tell what they look like because there body has not developed fat yet and if you wait too long then there will be too much fluid. it depends on where you live...if you dont live in the city chances are you would be best googling the biggest city that is close to you but  chances are there is a private clinic within an hour radius. good luck and congratulations.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	between weeks 18-34.. and you'll have to google around for places in your area.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	This one is near me but you can use their calendar to see a best time for your ultrasound http://www.preciousimagesultrasound.com/...|`|MkCTwE95aa	It depends where you live. The one around me said the best time was between 26 - 32 weeks if you are a little thicker they advise to wait until 28 weeks. i had one at 26 weeks and it seemed pretty good to me. You should be able to google places in your area that offer them and since they aren't considered medical ultrasounds they are usually done in a store like setting. The place i went to had big screen tv's and leather couches for everyone to sit and i brought 10 people with me.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	they say the best time is 7 months    so 28 weeks    good luck     google search 4d ultrasounds and the city and state you live in|`|eDnWMm3maa	between 29 and 31 weeks. Google for  private clinics near you.    fyi - 4d simply means a VIDEO of a 3d ultrasound.|`|zuZKj3xXaa	around 30 weeks :) and anywhere near you, they should have one...4d is the best..:) u can buy dvd's of the ultrasound!!     due Feb 19th|`|5puE2Qfpaa	At 25 weeks it was to late for me, the us. tech said it could be a waste of money because there would be a possibility of it being blurry.
4lHJEq5Haa	she has this Fisher Price thingy that she likes to chew on. It plays songs and lights up. she's always playing with it. This woman sings all these songs like "Hey Diddle Diddle" and the alphabet. She sounds like a reject from the touring company of "Rent."|`|33h5R8nTaa	We have this bin kinda thing on the side of the couch with diapers and lotions and no stink bags and stuff like that so we dont always have to run back and forth every time we change her. She has a ton of toys but always seem to go to this bin and pull it over and take all the no stink bags and they are everywhere all the time no matter how many times we take them away from her he keeps getting them. like right now  the box of wipes with the exta packages of them are all over the kitchen. She has no intrest in her toys.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	My daughter got this monkey that sits on a ball. It rolls away as to encourage crawling. She is not even 3 months old yet and it is still in the box yet it is so annoying! When you bump into it or even sometimes walk by it, there it goes, spinning and spinning. My seven year old has an idog. It's cute but she blasts it. And during the day it goes off by itself....it barks and taps its foot and I don't know how to turn it off!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I can't stand the LeapFrog toys. My sister once bought my son one of those lap type toys that you press buttons on and read the book at the same time. The voice was SOOO annoying that we gave it away. Same with the learning train or whatever it was called - we tried hiding it in several places, but they kept finding it. LOL So, that toy is now annoying some other parent somewhere else. LOL|`|62R21NzNaa	Twirlin Whirlin Garden! I hate it so much!|`|qGQCLFinaa	I have to go for all the annoying noise makers everyone thinks is so funny to buy my kiddo for Christmas or his birthday, he has a monster truck that makes music & all sorts of noises & it is SOOO LOUD!   He also had this toy that had a steering wheel & a gear shift like driving a car toy, but it would go off in the middle of the night, it had this evil sounding laugh on one of the buttons & i would be laying in bed alone (cause my fiance was out of town working) and just be getting to sleep then hear that laugh UUUGGHH! it make me crazy!!! I was SOOO happy when the batteries went dead.... until we got new ones... but it quit going of randomly like that.....|`|njLVIp55aa	Well i only have an 8 month old baby girl but i hate this one rattle thing that she likes cause its hard and when she gets excited she starts waving it and has on several occassions smacked my in the eye with it pretty hard making around my eye sore...But she loves it so i, like you, always give it back...    I agree that the noise maker toys dont really bother me much!|`|5Crovdoaaa	Can I just cover all of them and say anything with batteries that plays music? :0) My son has the Leapfrog green plastic caterpillar, it's so loud and annoying I keep trying to hide it. That music is like nails on a chalkboard.|`|723QHuicaa	A fifi and the flowertots musical tv, the song it sings... urgh! And it seem s like it never stops, pressing the button once makes the song go about 4 times! we conveniently left it at grandma's|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I really don't mind his toys noise or not. What I do find highly annoying though is when my 7 year old starts banging on the music keys over and over and over. It drives me crazy!!!

3a8d8200494dea80c8e22d328cd4879aaa	The company should know. Call them and ask.
7SKVCPcSaa	yes. i agree. i do not want to see abortion pictures!  maybe put "in the womb at 16 weeks" and that may get you better results.    but i do think the pictures should be allowed and viewable online. its a great way for teens and 'abortion lovers' to see exactly what happens when they kill their babies. it is upsetting but i know a few women who have went for adoption versus abortion because of pictures on the web.|`|a0cec08ffbd6cf10f87ca2426641db05aa	No offence but if someone is willing to have an abortion I think they should know exactly what it entails and yes if that entails them looking at the baby they aborted then so be it. It might make them think twice about doing it again! If these woman are looking to get over what they have done they need to face the facts first! Sorry I know alot of people won't agree with me but it's my opinion.    I'm 6 weeks pregnant myself at the moment, so I can undertsand how upsetting the pictures can be, but I think they should be there for people to see. At the end of the day it is a reality in todays world so the more people are aware of what actually happens the better. Again just my opinion.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Babycenter.com has a week by week look at fetus development. Yes, there should be a warning on the pictures that pop up, but then they wouldn't be able to make women feel guilty about past choices.|`|K6rZmVmAaa	I'm 13 weeks pregnant and have come across this too, but they're trying to stop so many babies being killed, this is a good thing. At least you can feel that emotion the babies that are killed never will.    They should of used condoms|`|Ia0ZivJMaa	teenager,boys and girls|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I am sorry that your searches have been filled with that kind of material, and I personally think that only women who wish to remain pregnant should do so - it's hard enough to have a desired pregnancy.   The link below is for a 16 week information, and they have some pictures of living fetuses but not full body pics of every week (hard to get), none are terminated (if it helps).|`|3a8d8200494dea80c8e22d328cd4879aaa	There's a pro-life booth that's set up every year for our State Fair where they show HUGE pictures of aborted fetuses for everyone to see. It's pretty disgusting to look at, especially for kids. It's just ridiculous shock/fear tactics.    It's illegal to display (tasteful) nude artwork or photos in public, but it's very legal to show graphic abortion photos. It doesn't make much sense.    I'm not saying that those photos should be censored, but they should not be shoved in people's faces whether it's in public or at the top of an image search on the web. And yes, people can manipulate web searches to suit their agenda.
fkuKHXqJaa	Mylicon drops work great for gas. My son doesn't have gas to bad either but I usually give it to him after feeding him. My son gets hiccups often and the Gripe water works wonders for that!!!|`|49nm71oCaa	My son was gassy- i gave him mylicon and it helped ALOT!! he was colicky.. also, my son is on formula and we had to switch formulas and when we did he wasnt gassy anymore!|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	Mylicon always worked for me but your child could be different . i used it before a feeding i just gave it to my daughter in the dropper|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I had a colic/gassy baby.  I used both.  Gripe water to calm an upset tummy, and Mylicon to get rid of gas in his digestive tract.  Since the Gripe water isn't medicine, I didn't think there was a problem to double up.  He always seemed to get releif from both.  Leg exercises can also help with gas.  I would dose him usually after his feedings.|`|OPloDbxvaa	i always have used gripe water and it always worked for me , i given it after feeding if he's coliky , or if it gets really bad, my doc recomended that i put a little like 5 ml with and oz of water heated up , and burp him after he's in heaven..     good luck
TAIlyvgyaa	I can't put my finger on it, but there is something about them that is making me think of a lawfirm, or shoe manufacturers or something like that.  I think it's because they are both also surnames, together they sound like letter heading.    Someone else mentioned this, since you are questioning it, you kinda know yourself it's not the sound you are looking for for the names.|`|ace1da8d9697bcba6a616faa6d80b4b0aa	No, not corny at all.  They are strong names, but there isn't anything wrong with that.|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Yeah, I wouldn't do it, you're already hesitating.|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Way too corny.

oOyXJtNvaa	Maybe he is just shy?  Have you ever had a conversation with the guy?  And people tell you he doesn't like you.. Don't belive what people say unless it comes from his mouth!    Do you have feelings for him?|`|kxIopSI8aa	I think he likes you but is afraid that of he tells you you'll say you don;t like him. Just make the first move and tell him that you like him.|`|drI1vsJdaa	He's either immature, or embarrassed about liking you. It sounds like he's in denial.|`|SWOeg0jFaa	"he also knows my name my lunch and all of my friends."  sorry dear, but that doesn't necessarily mean he likes you, I know those things about a lot of people who I don't like.  And are you sure he is looking at you and not at someone/something else around you. Maybe he's looking at you for a different reason than you think....sorry to be a downer, it's just what I think.  Either that or he does like you and he's just immature.  PS I don't need to look at your picture, what does that have to do with everything, do you want us all to tell you how pretty you are?|`|aNtlzmAHaa	ya someone does that 2 me 2. most likely he does like u but is 2 embarrassed b/c he thinks his friends will make fun of him 4 liking u, especially if he is super popular. my advice? if he is 2 embarrassed 2 admit he likes u, he is probably a jerk. u could do a lot better. 4get about him!|`|4DoXomHZaa	Your link doesn't work.    Your lunch has a name?     Sorry, knowing your name and friends names is NOT "all the signs" someone likes you.     Be mature and ignore it. But I think you like the attention. Otherwise you wouldn't be wasting time asking about him.
2G8lOPN8aa	I agree with being safe by not having soft bedding in the crib with an infant--we used the blanket sleepers too... but the risk of SIDS is greatly reduced after five months... if he doesn't need a blanket to keep warm--I don't see any reason to introduce one if you are more comfortable with him not having one for safety issues...though at 7 months I would think he is perfectly fine having one if you'd like to give him one.       Once children have reached that developmental milestone where they can roll over at will--you are fine with giving them a blanket.  Most 7 month olds can already sit up unassisted.  Some are even crawling at that stage.    I don't think there is any particular consideration to be made in giving them a blanket...just cover him up with one when he goes to sleep...and voila!  They tend to wiggle around a lot in their cribs anyway--so it probably won't end up on him for long anyway.  Alot of babies become really attached to their blankets|`|pXSKSS3daa	Really? We had blankets and cuddly toys in our son's crib when he turned 7 months. We've also always had a bumper in there(I know, I'm a horrible parent).    If you feel comfortable with doing it let him have a blanket. Of course, this is only if he's rolling/moving around and has good control of his neck but I'm sure by 7 months he does.|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	I started with bumpers, a sheet and a blanket.  You need to keep the little guy warm.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My son still sleeps in a naked crib at 7 months.  He does like to suck on burp cloths and things so when he's a year old, I'll probably let him have a little comfort blanket.    For those that are curious, an empty plain crib reduces the risk of SIDS.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Very slowly. =) I recently gave my son a mini blanket. It's maybe 6"x6"... velvety on one side and fuzzy on the other. It gives him something to hold on to if he wakes up at night and helps him ease himself back to sleep. I got this at Wal-Mart for about $10.00. It was in the blanket section. =)    We also have a breathable mesh bumper fo him. I got this at Babies'r'us for about $30.00.    I wouldn't put to many things in at once though because he'll be so interested in all the new "Toys" he will never fall asleep. =)|`|wTeJulT5aa	You can use a cellular blanket (the one with holes, like crochet).  If he manages to get the blanket over his head, he can still breathe.|`|PSI3mNgcaa	May i ask why you dont have nothing in it ?|`|PbBWJGsTaa	My 9 month old little girl's cot looks horribly bare too.  We use grobags, so no blankets, and we've never put a bumper up..  I think theyre only meant for very young babies.  I have put a couple of little soft toys in there now though, if theyre small they are supposed to be perfectly safe.  She plays with them when she wakes in the morning.  7 months is OK to start using blankets provided your baby is strong and mobile enough.  Mine loves her grobag though.  I use a blanket at naptime but she always winds up kicking it straight off.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	I would just make it comfy and see how he reacts    Find a bumper -- it's useful when they start trying to stick their feet and hands through the crib slats (also when they start rolling around, a bumper is kinder on their heads than the slats are)    When you put him in his bed at night, and for naps, try covering him with a little blanket and see what he does    Does he have a "lovey"?  Something he's attached himself to during the day?  You could put that in with him    I always try things and see what happens.  If my son doesn't react well, I try something different.  It's all you can do =)|`|5Crovdoaaa	Once they start rolling over and move their head side to side when sleeping, they can have blankets and bumpers. This is usually only advised for little babies, who don't move themselves while asleep. By seven months, your baby should know how to move his head if he's got his face in a blanket or bumper. My youngest son is 8 months and has had blankets and bumper since almost 4 months, when he started rolling.|`|ZIdhNsxPaa	I've always had a blanket on my daughter, a small one, but one nonetheless. How else would you keep him warm? Stuffed animals aren't necessary until they form an attachment to them when they get older.|`|4eurlgWCaa	I know about the risk od SIDS, so what i would recommend its to have just like i stiffed animal, make him sleep on one of those sleeping saques, i don't know the name, to keep them warm and what i have used its a crocheted blanket with lots of holes... it still keeps him warm, but even if he covers his face he can breathe.
ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Pick the one that is best for you.  Look at the hours, pay, location etc.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Forget which one pays more.    1. A grocery has the possibility of being held up.    2. Would you be able to get home from a drive-in after work since, they are usually open late.    3. Can you handle the responsibility of working in a nursing home.|`|3FKMMoXkaa	I think a nursing home...if you plan to do a job like nurse or doctor...it will look good if you tell the employers or whatever.    I think grocery store if you want to be a dietician or a p.e teacher.    A drive in..I dont know why.    I will choose nursing home, I LOVE to help people.|`|ySKK7lCyaa	what one pays more?|`|3LEPfzVhaa	Pick best pay, closest to your house, best hours for how much you will be payed, the place that looks most enjoyable and interesting, and the place that would work best with what you want to do when your older.

We do all sorts with them. At first I was reserved and thought "this will be so boring" but it's amazing! The people are just so wise.     So, yes, I'd say the nursing home.|`|BktjgS2naa	Apply for all of them and then find out which one pays the most and has the best benefits.

Ccq8zEcnaa	The way I look at abortion is this: That baby never asked to be created in the first place, and then it IS a living breathing human from the day it is conceived. I think it's unbelievable how someone can just casually decide or even think that it's not murder. It is a living human, that never chose to be created. You should take responsibility for what you've done, and give a human life a chance. You may not have the means to care for a child for the rest of your life, but that's what adoption is for. And, finally, they are millions of women out there that would make GREAT mothers, and can not get pregnant for anything. Then there are these women and young girls that get pregnant oh so easily by mistake. Think of how those millions of women feel, what they would give to be able to be pregnant! I strongly feel you should reconsider adoption over a careless abortion.|`|4lKc0gCfaa	Abortion has become a big political issue in the US and the republicans are trying to make it illegal, without thinking that women can do it in other countries or can do it illegally, also they do not think if abortion becomes illegal "because it is a murder", does it mean a women who had illegal abortion should be charged as a murderer and go to jail?   I think of it as a personal issue, not political and women should be able to choose, there is nothing wrong with abortion. Also the risks are same risks as delivering a baby.|`|QufZeqlVaa	If a woman dont want children or think they dont want it and prefer abortion why not use a condom in the first place.to prevent pregnancy. i hate the fact that many woman are getting rid of their child .|`|lnUrm4sGaa	people object as they feel its killing a innocent life but what i say is it all depends on that persons circumstances,|`|dPULl5hjaa	IT'S YOUR BODY DO WHATEVER TO IT - IT'S YOUR DECISION.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	people see that as murdering a child . and taking away a life and that life has no choice and will never see the world .|`|9ionkBvuaa	How would you like if you were killed in your mom's wound.|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Well i'm personally with abortion because of all the people willing to **** each other for the pleasure, not thinking about the consequences. Just with the thought of two dumb-asses like that raising a child...it sickens me. As the kid grows up he/she will most likely be wishing they were dead anyways..so might as well do it now painlessly.|`|nXxtBkguaa	the problem is that the baby has a life.  It's a person.    The most horrific thing is that by the time most abortions take place, the baby is smart enough to struggle away from the doctor that's trying to murder it.  It has a heart beat, it has a partially developed mind and probably kind of even a personality and it's debateable weather it has the capacity to feel pain!    And if you kill it it's dead, and we lose all that wonderful light and that wonderful person.  It's terrible.|`|ycNt74yyaa	It hurt like hell. They punched me in my tummy. My man wouldn't even pay. Meanipants. :(|`|gli7SbBoaa	There are no right or wrongs answers.  Though some people will tell you that you are horribly wrong if you have one.  You do what is best for you.  If you cannot support a child and cannot stand the idea of carrying it and bonding with it just to give it up then you abort.      Some will say you're wrong and some will say you're right but what matters is what YOU think is best.|`|GGBDkOuFaa	I would never kill my child, how could anyone do that?    I think its sick that women use it as a form of birth control. Just SICKENING!|`|6ypnDnvLaa	Abortion is a very controversial subject.   You may not think there's nothing wrong with it, but they do.  Some people pair Abortion right with Murder because single cells are living things.|`|6e72fe5eaebe0f66961aa766d452c09faa	like alot of people i see it as murder but also at the same time understand that every person has the right to make up there own mind. if your friends see it as murder then this is probably why they were so shocked. please dont get yourself in the position where you have an abortion as it can ruin the rest of your life if you regret it after. have fun but stay safe|`|fE5zMOfJaa	Why don't you think it's wrong?  At 5 weeks the baby's heart starts beating.  And when you stop a heart...you are killing it!  Why people don't understand that I'm not sure.   They just want an easy way out.  But it's the cowardly way out!|`|Ys10tX6Yaa	lol i just did an essay on this you know, but yes i thought it is counted as murder and also if your religious it murder in some of them, but come on your going to risk an innocent life?|`|2QpCk8V8aa	So you didn't think there's anything wrong with killing your child?  Think about it|`|u18GBKmiaa	some people see it as murder i personally think theres nothing wrong with it  its not murder its not even a properly formed foetus when people have an abortion|`|sfZP0Cz2aa	its murder huni x its another life living in you i would never kill a baby|`|YTwimNJJaa	People object to it because they think it is murder.     I think it's a personal choice, and one which nobody will take lightly... Nobody should use it as a form of contraception, just as a last option when things go wrong!    I think it is important that people feel able to make the choice for themselves and would much rather a woman not bring a child into the world (and be unable to take care of it) just because she thinks she has to.    It obviously isn't an ideal situation, but I think it needs to be an option... So long as girls realise their mistake and take steps to not let it happen again!    There are laws as to how long into the pregnancy you can have an abortion and this is in place to try and ensure there is no (or minimal suffering) on the behalf of the foetus... I hope they don't feel anything but I guess I will never know 100%    As for other dangers - it can cause damage to a woman's body - it can create difficulties if the woman ever decides to have a baby later in life but as far as I know, problems don't happen too often...|`|a0cec08ffbd6cf10f87ca2426641db05aa	It's so bad cos it kills a baby!!!!|`|9973c6e02e14ba355b22d50b1410ec1baa	If you don't know the risks or the immoral/moral arguments, then I would say you are not mature enough to have a sexual relationship - therefore, no need to worry about it....|`|bHjxnGyOaa	I think I would raver my child not go through pain and suffering all it's life so if it's a serious case yes I would have it.      But im only a 12 year old smiley nothing I need to worry about right now :)|`|t2QEgxJlaa	I personaly hate abortions. I would never kill my child|`|a7xuzUPeaa	Having abortions is a personal choice. Having them causes scar tissue, some women that do it over and over again can't have children when they finally decide they want them. No one can judge someone for getting an abortion, because they don't know that persons story. I would personally never get one. I have three kids and I would keep having them. Everyone makes choices and other people should not judge or harass people about it.|`|4SVZ84LNaa	Some people think it's wrong and their religion forbids it because they believe it to be murder but in the early stages the baby is nothing but a a few cells so it's not like killing a baby.  A lot of people think it's a stupid thing to do incase having the abortion makes you infertile but there is practically no risk of the abortion making you infertile. The only thing likely to cause infertility would be an infection caused by the abortion but infections can be treated easily and would have to go untreated for a very long time to make you infertile.  If you get pregnant and you know in your heart you're not ready for a child and can't offer it the life it deserves then I think abortion is a very sensible option.xx|`|LofOjmeMaa	Ok now reported ,goading for peoples reactions on abortion and this is not allowed 'chat'|`|JhcOeplZaa	I have had one before and feel that there is nothing wrong with it at all but, now Im 36 weeks pregnant with a baby girl and Im so thankful that I listened to my fiance and didnt abort her.  Good Luck on your choices.|`|djFYf3qUaa	babies are innocent...and to take their life away, just because you don't want it, or don't wanna deal with it, is STUPID.  At least put them up for adoption or something.  EVERYTHING IS WRONG WITH ABORTION. If you think nothing is wrong with that....you need to go to mental hospital.  And it doesn't help that our president is democratic, he supports abortion....which is sickening.  GET A LIFE people who see that there is nothing wrong with abortion!

S54gceW8aa	Congrats to you both!<br>  I really like Eliana Avery and Harleigh Savannah. I think if you choose Aaliyah you should pair that with Aubrianna. Eliana and Harleigh are pretty and unique. They both stand out. Aubrianna and Aaliyah are both common. So I think it's a matter of whether you want them to have more common names or more unique names. Either both of their names should be common or both unique. Not one of each. <br>  Either way, it sounds like you're on the right track! Congrats again! |`|HasWwt7Uaa	The two names I really like, taken from your list are<br>  Gabrielle and Eliana..... They are very nice, pretty, a bit exotic, and classy. I would urge you to choose one syllable names for their middles names IF your last name is 2 or more syllables. <br>  <br>  For instance, Eliana Grace & Gabrielle Jane<br>  <br>  {if I HAD to pick your 1 syllable names, it would have to be Skye and Jayde}<br>  <br>  My daughter, now 16 - always chastises and teases me for naming her Abigail Elizabeth Montgomery!  ^_^|`|VF7IgCQcaa	Oh tough choice, those are some great names!<br>  <br>  I think my favorites for first names would be Aaliyah and Harleigh, although I really like Eliana, too. (Don't like the capital A in it though)<br>  <br>  Aaliyah Ariana and Harleigh Makena.. Those sound great!|`|OHhsm7aQaa	pretty names...to choose from your lists I would have to pair Eliana Avery with Harleigh Savannah or Harleigh Makena.<br>  a name I like more, again selecting  from your lists, is Morgan Rylie.<br>  congrats and good luck!|`|IQWsxkVXaa	I don't really like any of them.  They all look like a mouthful.  I prefer smaller name combinations like my daughters names...Lily Mae and Eva Jinx.|`|71cDkcrxaa	Harleigh McKenna and Savannah Jaide<br>  <br>  Good luck! :]|`|AA11834952	Aaliyah Skye and Harleigh Morgan<br>  |`|U3krV70Raa	I like Eliana Rylie and Harleigh Savannah the best. I think the names are beautiful and wish you blessing. |`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Aaliyah Skye and Elianna Morgan. Very pretty. Ally and Ellie could be their nicknames. They sound so cute together. :-)|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Aubrinna Morgan and Makenna Skye|`|bzkSIJYnaa	from each set...<br>  Aaliyah Gabrielle and Harleigh Skye.<br>  <br>  Harleigh Madelyn and Aubriana Skye<br>  <br>  EliAna Jaide and Aaliyah Skye. <br>  * i prefer the spelling Eliana Jade, unless there is a particular reason you chose those spellings like family names, etc. <br>  <br>  but out of those 3 i like EliAna Jaide and Aaliyah Skye. They are absolutely gorgeous! feminine, classy, and elegant. <br>  Eliana Jade is actually one of my favorite name combos ever!<br>  <br>  good luck :)<br>   - Eva |`|UJaCObdyaa	Harleigh Savannah & Aaliyah Makena<br>  <br>  Harleigh Morgan & Rylie Makena<br>  <br>  Makena Rylie & Morgan Savannah<br>  <br>  Makena Skye & Rylie Jadyn<br>  <br>  Makena Rylie & Jadyn Savannah|`|5sYzlAjPaa	I love the name Eliana. <br>  <br>  i choose<br>  <br>  Eliana Morgan and Aubriana Makena|`|doLyOac0aa	Sorry i don't like any of those names,|`|NePgB9b2aa	To be honest, I'm sorry but none of the sets are totally legit or look like real names. How about these ideas instead?<br>  <br>  Gabrielle Skye and Hazel Morgan<br>  Harper Skye and Aubriana Jade<br>  Madelyn Jade and Aubriana Morgan<br>  Avery Skye and Jade Makena<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  |`|UI04rrWVaa	I love the names Aubriana Skye and Aaliyah Makena those are beautiful names and they go together perfectly........I love them good thinking|`|4863f8dd77952e57a9c03006243c12c6aa	Harleigh Makena and Aubriana Skye<br>  Eliana Jaide and Aaliyah Skye<br>  |`|DX5LC3eBaa	I never heard the name Aubriana before it is really pretty. I like Aubriana Skye and Aaliyah Gabrielle<br>  or<br>  Harleigh Morgan and Eliana Jade|`|SBJFaICkaa	Harleigh Savannah and Aubriana Makena|`|dwOLnFnlaa	Eliana Skye and Aubriana Makena :)<br>  <br>  Congrads!|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	EliAna Jaide and Aaliyah Skye, different put beautiful <br>  |`|v6DRUwH7aa	Aaliyah Makena & Eliana Jaide
AA11185897	It is VERY possible that he NEVER thinks about the Abortion.    It is something you will live with your Entire Life.    As for him being on and off with talking to you, He's a MAN, they do that sometimes.    Find a way to forgive yourself and turn it over to God or it will always be the hardest thing to live with.|`|pS02JGTUaa	don't get an abortion.  not only is it murdering your unborn baby, but it will scar you for the rest of your life..|`|flqAr30laa	This was a decision you yourself should have made regardless what anybody else thought. One should ask herself  "Can I live with myself if I do this?"  Some women can, others cannot, and you my dear are the latter.  Forgive yourself.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Yes, did you have to ask?|`|9ionkBvuaa	NO!  no   no  no.|`|fFqzD3aMaa	He's probably pretty damn thankful you got the abortion. You did the right thing|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Well if he's against abortion then next time tell him to keep it in his pants..if he's gonna get "scared" every time a girl he slept with gets pregnant. Actions have consequences, if he can't handle a child then next time use protection or take care of your baby. What the hell is it with people these days? Control your damn urges if you can't handle the consequences..see this gets me really mad. Flamed, actually. And if he does "hate" you now tell him to suck it up, he let you know that it was your decision and you can do what you wish..which you did, so he has no reason to be mad. Seems to me this lost little boy is too immature to be sleeping with anyone. I'm not against abortion though, If both parents were drunks/ druggies..then the child would have to live a life wishing they were dead anyways, so good thing you got an abortion. Who cares whether "the whole baby thing" would have played a part in it, he told you that you could do what you want..which you did, so if he's gonna ignore you like a little school girl with a grudge then so be it. He shouldn't say its OK next time..and for the record, please do tell him to keep it in his pants if he's gonna act like this.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	abortion is murder and tahts the only answer you're going to get here.. if you don't want to keep the baby, you really need to consider adoption.|`|ace1da8d9697bcba6a616faa6d80b4b0aa	It probably does have a part in it.  When you are pregnant you have hard decisions to make and he's probably wishing he'd manned up about it.  You made your choice, and if you are having troubles with the emotional aspects, maybe someone at the physicians office could provide you with phone numbers to get some counseling.  Good Luck.|`|iZDsMCghaa	Sounds like it. Sounds like he was scared but didnt want you terminate and it just never left his mind. For him, theres a loss that he wont ever forget, regardless of the scary I dont know what to do feeling he had in the begining.|`|GGBDkOuFaa	Abortions aren't a form of birth control    Adoption is the answer.     Get a grip|`|QhVCn7rsaa	He told you he was against abortions adn you got one. His ex was pregnant does he not know how to use condoms.    Are you looking for a relationship with this guy??? If not then i suggest you forget about him and move on|`|NSFuIeZYaa	I've been in that same boat and it does haunt us. I think guys think about it from time to time but I dont believe it impacts them as it does us. I dont think thats the reason hes off and on persay I think he just doesnt know how to handle being around you because of how you may feel about the situation|`|RgO3Sn38aa	For killing a baby because you didn't want it?  Disgusting!!!  What about you?  What do you think of yourself?|`|6ypnDnvLaa	"could the whole baby thing have played a part in this?"   Absolutely. What happened was the lad's childhood flashed before his eyes.  He's traumatized and a little scared. On top of that he might feel guilty for the baby because he sees abortion as murder. (single living cell)     He said: "i understand you cant ruin your life", but having a child(the act alone) doesn't ruin your life.  In fact, its what makes life worthwhile.|`|WcvsBgLuaa	That probably killed him that you had an abortion.|`|enUbhPX3aa	If you kill your baby before it even has a chance to live, you will never forgive yourself. in 10 years time you'll still be thinking about what could have been. I was in your same position when I was 19 and if I'd have gone through with it, I know I'd never have been the same person.  The first time you hear your baby cry, you'll wonder how you ever considered aborting it.|`|fnk27F8xaa	He sounds like a winner...knocking chicks up, left and right. I'd try to hang on to him.|`|iupKQv1Maa	he probably said he was okay with it because he was scared.  now he regrets ever letting you do it. he probably feels guilty.  just make sure he knows that youre sorry and you never meant to hurt him.  if he wont talk about it.. then you need to make the move and make him talk about it. holding in the hurt wont help.|`|6k61JQfRaa	possibly..but personally it was your choice to make because you were carrying the baby, and if he didn't want you to have an abortion he should have told you not to and should have been more involved in the pregnancy.|`|fE5zMOfJaa	O definitely!  And I actually think you'd be a good person to talk to these other pregnant girls who are contemplating abortion.  They seem to think that when they have an abortion that's it!  They don't think about the long-term emotional effects it will have on them.  They just act on impulse.  Just like you think about it everyday...I'm sure your guy friend does the same thing...especially since he was against abortion.  It seems like he was trying to be understanding & didn't wanna force you to do anything but I'm sure he's wishing he would've spoke up more.  So he too probably feels a lot of guilt.  Just talk to him about how you feel & maybe he'll open up to you.|`|a732cc20369212fe385773a398cdf5b8aa	i am sure the abortion has a lot to do with it. its a tough thing and i am assuming that you both were kind of young so it may have really caused him some emotional damage but dont feel bad about your decision but yes im sure the abortion does have something to do with how he is acting. good luck|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I think that if you didn't want to have a baby, you should have used birth control and if he didn't want to have a baby, he should have used a condom.  I think it's ridiculous that he already accidentally got someone pregnant and didn't learn from it!  I'm pro-choice, but for people to just be reckless and then use abortion as birth control is completely irresponsible.    And no, I don't think he ever thinks about it because apparently he didn't learn his lesson the first time it happened!|`|7d632fbyaa	Probably he is doing that because of what you did, in the beginning he told you he was against abortion. Why you did not listen to him.?    This is for every girls/women out there: Abortion is not the solution to the problem. If anyone get pregnant find help and there are allot of women out there that can't have babies. There's always a choice for putting the baby in adoption.  GOOD LUCK GOD BLESS YOU BE BLESS TAKE CARE|`|PhkLLwVbaa	I think you having the abortion was a mistake just because it sounds like you did it to please him and then your stuck with the after effect of that decision you will never be able to forget about it especially when you get pregnant again and have that baby. It sounds to me like as much as he was against it he was relieved that you did it but it doesn't make it any easier on him to be able to face you because he knows what you had to do and why you did it and he knows the bottom line is that you didn't keep that baby because of him. I would let him go completely that is the only way you will be able to come to at least a little bit of peace with it all. Good luck best wishes|`|srf8MllRaa	abortion is not always a good thing. but when you know you are not ready for a baby than what else can you do BUT also you should use CONDOMS to prevent these type of decisions. IT WAS WRONG FOR HIM NOT TO GIVE YOU SUPPORT AND HELP YOU OUT WITH THE DECISION YOU TOOK. BECAUSE IT WAS ALSO HIS RESPONSIBILITY AND HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE TO HELP YOU OUT! SO YOU SHOULD NOT FEEL BAD ABOUT IT. IF HE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO ABORT THAN HE SHOULD HAVE SAT DOWN WITH YOU AND TALKED ABOUT THE SITUATION. MAYBE HE DID WANT THE BABY BUT HE WAS AFRAID DIDN'T. LIKE I SAID YOU  TWO SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION. DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT IT HE SHOULDNT TREAT YOU LIKE THAT IGNORING YOU IS NOT THE ANSWER..
k0QRfQ00aa	That is absolutely perfect! That is normal to me. When I was in the same situation you were in with my youngest I she was 6 1/2 pounds and I had her exactly at 40 weeks and she was close 7 pounds 10 ounces .|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	My son was 6 pounds when I delivered at 37 weeks...so this would be average I guess... :) Congrats!!!  And the ultrasounds for the weight are not always right! :)|`|vKEYa8aeaa	babys differ but i would say average is 6-7 pounds      at my 28 week u/s appointment my baby weighed over 3 pounds, he is a chubber|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	i think thats normal i had my daughter at 37 weeks and she weighted 7 lbs 7 ozs|`|njLVIp55aa	Every baby is different but that sounds about right...My baby girl was born at 36 weeks and weighed 6 pounds 9 oz and still had to go to ICU for a week because her lungs werent developed!     When she was born they said she was average weight for a baby that old.|`|QhVCn7rsaa	A friend of mine would love her baby to be that weight. She is 35 weeks and her baby is already 9lbs    Your baby sounds normal weight. My baby was 5 1/2 lbs at 35 weeks and only gained 1lb in 6 weeks as i was late having her.    Good Luck|`|7C9Ett7Caa	According to the best selling pregnancy book "What to Expect When Your Expecting", at 35 weeks, the average is 5 1/2 lbs, and at 36 weeks, the average is 6 lbs. So I would say your over average. Your baby may be pretty big. Your baby gains about a half pound a week, so I would estimate your baby being around 8 1/2 lbs or more.. Wow, you've been eating good, your going to have a very healthy baby!! Congrats!!|`|Xct8kXLsaa	when i had my little girl at 36 weeks she was right at 7 lbs. and she got to go home with me the very next day.|`|P2hhUsoMaa	My daughter was born at 36 weeks and was 4lbs 12 ozs.  Every baby is different though.  I bet 6 1/2lbs is normal.  My daughter was small from the getgo.|`|YK8P5rNXaa	They really don't know they are just guessing.... With my first and 2nd baby they told me that the baby is about 8 pounds at 36 weeks and my baby came out to be 7 pounds lol the same with my 2nd.... But 6 pounds is normal start walking alot....
f6qbRAmvaa	mine was the same she would move at times and then stop for a few days they have their lazy days like us but now at 26 weeks she moves and kicks hard all day long u can try drinking oj and layn on ur side if not than i would call the dr and ask him or her or go to the er better safe than sorry.. good luck and congrats :)|`|0fe4f3702c5dd1a403524194d3e9fabdaa	Some babies arent very active. But thats not the case for me im 24 weeks & my baby moves around like crazy! If you are really worried though ask yur DR.|`|KK3RkRjxaa	I didn't start feeling my baby until 28 weeks. My placenta is in front of the baby so it makes it harder for me to feel her. I can feel her now but it isn't like I feel her every second of the day. I'm sure everything is fine but if you have doubts contact your doctor.|`|JhcOeplZaa	My baby didn't become active till about 26 weeks now im 36 weeks. Cherish the unactiveness. lol. Good Luck.
5HGDhEjyaa	Yes, Alec is a nice and unique name.  Good luck.|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	Yes, I do like it.  What middle name are you thinking?|`|zXSjBHAAaa	It's okay in my opinion you should name your son that if you like it...it is your child.|`|wi6mkT30aa	I always thought his name was nice! I like it a lot! =)|`|vvAyfBGCaa	I don't really like it very much.|`|FrkF7PaRaa	I don't like the name, no. Sorry.|`|cHEGf8Hcaa	I absolutely love the name.|`|UYAhesuvaa	I really like the name, there was a boy in my grade all through K-12 and every year the teachers would always pronounce his name "alex" so he had to always correct people, but I think it's a lovely name :)|`|HurPmgSaaa	I love the name Alec! I would use the name but I have a cousin Alec so its off limits but it's just a cute name.|`|SF1uPJZhaa	Smart Alec.     I prefer Alexander, which is also Alec Baldwin's actual full name: Alexander Rae Baldwin III|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	No, I don't, sorry.
gSteSrogaa	kix, and flavored cheerios (I make mine with handfuls of all kinds of cereals I happen to have handy)  dates  I don't know if sunflower seeds would go well with a 16 month old.  bits of coconut? Like the kind in the trail mixes, not the kind for cooking.  Ok, it isn't healthy, but what about chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, marshmellows, yogurt bites? yogurt covered raisins.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	You could add pretzels  Chex cereal  Dried bananna|`|mxrlZEweaa	That sounds really good, but the peanuts. You shouldn't give your 16 month old peanuts until they are 3.|`|shKc7lZcaa	My mom did this for us when we were kids and it was always a hit with us too!  Fun!!  She did always add a *few* M&M's though...it was nice to have that little dash of sweet in there.  Enjoy!!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I would not use any nuts do to allergies.    Cheerios, chex mix, kix, goldfish, pretzels, dried bagel bits, raisins, dried figs, yogurt covered raisins    I have my doubts that the American Pediatrics are right.  My son attends a small elementary school with 20 classrooms, all are nut free due to allergies in each class.  I understand most schools have gone nut free due to this from seeing questions posted on yahoo.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i would use all the stuff you did. but chex mix. my son loves that stuff! and maybe a few chocolate chips. a few wont hurt. or some M&Ms.. just a little sweetness to go with everything else. give the kid a little pep.    thats a great idea though. thanks so much for sharing!
QhVCn7rsaa	You need to go back to your doctor asap|`|AA10063059	how far gone are you?|`|da226878178305e69798e83c0c9aa3d8aa	you need to call the doctor again and tell them that happened  that's not a good sign at all...
MkCTwE95aa	The only way to know really is if you are trained in identifying your baby's body parts. I still cant tell whats a bum and whats a head but at my last appointment (30 weeks) my midwife said she felt transverse (sideways). But thats just a guess on her part, makes sense because i feel and see the baby move mostly towards the sides of my belly. ask if your doc can tell at your next appointment...but dont worry about that yet, there is still LOTS of time for the baby to move head down and even if he was head down now he could move to any other position at any time.|`|f6qbRAmvaa	i had asked the dr and she said that right now the baby still has room to move to there really isnt a way of knowing unless a ultrasound is done... this was at my 24 week apt i have another one next week ill be 27 weeks im going to ask again good luck and congrats :)
peMRRQHFaa	Personally i think you want to be pregnant , i have had all these feelings myself in the past, even to the extent where i actually talk to my belly!! I would say that you just have a case of to much wheat in your diet. let me know anyway :-)|`|NSFuIeZYaa	Hun you sound very pregent I wouldnt wait any longer, you need to know so you dont drink or do anything else you shouldnt|`|9Ycuoysjaa	It sounds like your pregnant. Take the test and find out hun. good luck. xx|`|MZPuDifYaa	You sound like it, go to a doctor to make sure though.|`|JhcOeplZaa	I realized i was pregnant 2 weeks into it because my boobs where sore and my appetite increased.  Good Luck.|`|mNKboVB2aa	Take the test and go to the doctor|`|lnUrm4sGaa	take the test i think you really could be  pregnant|`|VaA74PCZaa	Take to bloomin' test.|`|Dhsyroekaa	you wont have a belly yet. its way to small to even show.  Could be your period, fuller boobs, sore, sickness. I always get so sick to the point where i need to be by the toilet.  Also test wont work until 5 days before your missed period. So if you take it now, most likely get a negative result.     Either way good luck!!!|`|QhVCn7rsaa	Take the test, sounds very much like pregnancy.    I'm 12 weeks and i have all those symptoms.    Good Luck I hope you get the result you want|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Sounds just like me early on! :o) Good luck, hope you get the result you want! xxx|`|Acwau1Esaa	Large belly.|`|y2AlaCnfaa	just freaking take the test. ha|`|9973c6e02e14ba355b22d50b1410ec1baa	Why on earth are you waiting to take the test and relying on a load of guesswork from us lot!!!!|`|wAWDyFr2aa	dude just take the test.|`|4eurlgWCaa	Always I think that I am pregnant, I cant wait, get a blood test done...
tfTQ6Cuuaa	You can try an early test now....but your best bet would be to wait until next week, if you can! I hate seeing BFN's but I constantly pee on a stick "just in case".     Our minds have a terrible way of tricking us with the PMS/pregnancy symptoms being similar but I pretty much convince myself that I am pregnant every month and then of course I'm not or I wouldn't be posting here lol.    Hope it's your month!! If you do try an early test and it's negative, don't get discouraged too much just yet...it is still a little early for even First Response.|`|R6IYY4miaa	You just have to wait and take a pregnancy test. I'm sorry to have to say that but when you're trying to get pregnant people tend to exaggerate symptoms in their head. I know from experience. I'm sure this isn't want you're wanting to hear, but pregnancy test is the only way to go. Good luck, I hope you are!|`|AA12123844	I had my period on the 5th of June and shoulda started again around the 4th of July but around the 29th of June I noticed headaches and constant potty trips and incredibly sore breasts! Normally before a period my breast became tender but this was a different kind of tender, these suckers actually HURT! And sure enough when I took the test on the 9th of July I was pregnant. Sometimes our minds can play tricks on us and make us think we are having the symptoms we think we are having, but my biggest sign was my boobs, and when they were hurting like that I just knew it was different and I knew we were pregnant. Good luck to you!|`|enokoZ6Uaa	Your best bet is to get a pregnancy test after which, if the result is positive, go to the doctor. I have read, in my physiology books, that as women age their signs of menstruation change so just make sure you check with your doctor. Good Luck!|`|JhcOeplZaa	The nausea and watering mouth but not puking is exactly what happened to me but what really gave it away at 2 weeks was the sore boobs and massive appetite.  Good Luck
P2hhUsoMaa	Yes, I'd definately pack your bag now.  My first came at 36 weeks and 3 days.  I was so unprepared and I went to the hospital without my bag.  Only to find out I was in labor and I was staying.  I thought they would send me back home, but I was wrong.  On the other hand my son was born a week late.  So you just can't tell.  But I was definately prepared that time.  Good luck!|`|FXaHv4lgaa	Yep|`|AA10186411	37 weeks is full term, not 36.  But yes, you should go ahead and pack now, because you could still go early.
MSGixNibaa	I don't understand why you would change your name at all. There is nothing wrong with it. Are you getting judged unfairly because of it? Do people treat you wrongly because of it? No? You just don't like it?     I'm sorry, but that's not the greatest reason to change your name. You won't be the only Hans to walk down the streets of LA, but I can guarantee you that you won't be the only Ash Coco, either. Keep it simple, keep your name.|`|4399c07972a648f71f027f601137b670aa	take up a telephone directory and search|`|ace1da8d9697bcba6a616faa6d80b4b0aa	You are always going to be German.  There isn't much you can do about it, and you should be happy with who you are.  If you insist on changing your name -     Hansel Milo Kasmir|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	HAHA, very funny.|`|M2e4kkEuaa	Cedric is a unique name.|`|b957bvCsaa	Cedric is a little less standout then lots of those names...I  live in America and Apollo and Prince would definately stand out! But really, Hans isn't such a bad name. If it's way overused in Germany, then it probably won't be in the US!!|`|RnS7uVIGaa	I like Luke first name/or Lucas/ Logan   Please don't use sky walker in your name, really not cool.Having a new name should be carefully considered. I do like the following for a last name   Burke   Delany   Dante is o.k   Reagan   Tough[ kidding]   Good luck in your quest
0ebeadfc05507c25a34209b1ae74798aaa	I don't think you can because ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory drug and it can stop a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. When I took clomid I had severe cramps also, I just lay in bed and curl with the pain so hang in there k|`|vue9NOhYaa	Check with your doctor to be sure, but there is no reason to think an NSAID (which is what Ibuprofen is) would have the slightest effect on your hormones, or the effectiveness of Clomid.    To add to Jenn's comment: If you  have just started taking your meds and you're on  your period, you haven't ovuated yet, so there is NO egg to implant and no endometrium to be affectged.   Ibuprofen will do no harm.|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Motrin (ibuprofin) will not interfere with clomid.  zSo releive those cramps and feel better.  Good luck with the clomid.
ykrJB3NGaa	If possible, take him outside to "explore".   Leaves, bugs, twigs, crack in the sidewalk, anything.  Also, include exercise times of dancing, playing running, jumping, etc.  If there's somewhere you can take him to swim, that would be great.  The more exercise games, the more likely he will calm down for quieter play as well.|`|keaeuczRaa	You should make something up or play a certain game that he would like to play and then soon you will enter his own little world and you will also understand it!!!  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!|`|fe8RxYsfaa	If he wants to run around - let him.  It makes him more managable and makes him sleep better. Some kids don't do well sitting and playing, they need the physical activity.  Perhaps you could play catch, and play counting games while you catch.  Take a walk around the block. Take him to the park or a play area.|`|dcd11iUwaa	play things like hide and seek, if he likes to be be active let him. then he will sleep well :)|`|XNnx8aquaa	Pretend you're a lion and attack him...  play mini-tag, I don't know- be active yourself.|`|rjac15O0aa	So get up and play with him.  He won't want to stop just because you do.  Take him to a park with some slides and swings.  Even in a big toy store if its too cold out.|`|286158035f0bdbcd6406fc818ecc200faa	if you can't get out because of the weather, clean out a counter cabinet and put back only a couple of old pots and pans and their lids and maybe a couple of wooden spoons; show him that he can open that door; and let him play with the pots and pans.  try teaching him "pat-a-cake."    it's amazing the things that will amuse a small child, and a lot of them are things we have at hand.    if you can go outside where you live, have a sandbox and introduce him to large plastic cars, etc. and show him how to build a little town or race track in the sandbox; or go to a park that has infant swings and introduce him to "flight."  It's also possible he may meet other young children there and they can spend their energy playing together.|`|8dREUd2xaa	"to busy"- Wow- whatever the game is DON'T teach him how to spell. It's TOO busy. Sad.|`|sqaRnidQaa	peek a boo   pretend hes flying   make goofy sound effects.  to entertain a kid you dont have to think just do it|`|kAVdBqs8aa	get him outside and have him tag along while you do some sort of chore than needs to be done.     There is a website that is fantastic for toddlers too.     Starfall.com    if you can get him to work the basics of a mouse he is sure to get interested in this site. Its very well put together to be as forgiving and as easy as can be for preschoolers/toddlers.    I found the graphics and audio keep their attention and its a fantastic learning tool.|`|wAWDyFr2aa	My half-sister just turned 3, she as well has a really short attention span. She loves playing play-doh and catch, dress-up, hide-n-seek (hide in an obvious spot and jump out to tickle him), try coloring (but that doesnt work to well if they're not in the mood.) She likes to "play cards". We have this book with pictures and words in it. She loves to show off that she knows what the pictures are. OR just lay next to him and read him a book and show him the pictures (let him choose the book).
AA11091233	Once the tooth comes in he shouldn't be as cranky.    Please look into buying **homeopathic teething tablets**. I'm sorry I don't remember the company name..I believe it's Furman's. You can buy them at a health food store. That way you aren't using Tylenol all the time . For a 4 month old, just get a tablespoon (the kind for baking) put 2-3 little tablets in there and add a bit of room temperature water. Let the tablets dissolve and use a syringe (like an eye dropper or one you get from drugstore) and pull it up into the syringe and squirt it slowly into your baby's mouth. These tablets are totally harmless and work wonders. When your baby is older, you can then just put the tablets in his mouth...they are tiny, tiny and a bit sweet and they just dissolve in his mouth.    As far as teething rings...he is too young to hold them himself and keep them on his gums...you have to do it for him, if he will take it.    Orajel...doesn't really work all that well.    His screaming may be something else going on...is it possible he is gassy? Even with teething, unless they are all coming in at once...that seems a bit much. This sounds a bit more like colic...but you don't say if he stops crying when you pick him up...it's just a guess on my part.    Make sure of other things like if he is warm enough, put some white noise on...or beautiful soft music.    If all he can do is suck on his blanket...so be it. I just wouldn't use fabric softener on the blanket...as he would get that transfer of chemicals if he is sucking on it.    Please do try the teething tablets and they also have something called 'Calms Forte" for sleeping..I would mix the teething tabs and 2 Calms Forte before he goes to sleep at night. Calms Forte helps calm babies and help them sleep...it is homeopathic and can't harm him. I don't mean forever..but just try it and see if it helps.    Good luck...once the tooth cuts through, he won't be so cranky.    Take care. Sorry you are going through this!|`|pXSKSS3daa	It will go away when the tooth breaks through the gums. Unfortunately, though, he may be this way with EVERY tooth that comes in.    My son has had five(with possibly two more coming) come in in this past month and it hasn't been fun, that's for sure!|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	my daughter was only cranky til they broke the skin but she didnt cute her first tooth til 9 1/2 month old .|`|jVhWIDRnaa	Oh, I wish it would! Taylor is almost three and a half months and is cutting one. She has been such a crank! If she's like that with all of them its a rough road ahead!!    The thing that she likes the best is a cold teething ring.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	well my daughter just went through that she was sooooooo cranky for a week only. she'd cry day and night literally nothing helped. and i htought it was something else but the doctor said it was teething. and well after the week of hell she suddendly went back to her happy self and slept again and i was so happy but still no tooth but last friday i took her to the doctor for her 6month check up and yep the tooth is cutting through already but no more crying or anything. so i dont think it will last soo long. only when the gums get swollen and its ready to cut through i think.. but all kids are different i guess|`|1c8b3f1b010227dade0229a14ba8bd73aa	It should go away when the tooth breaks through the skin.  And then it will start back over with the next tooth...........and on and on and on.    But that's NOTHING compared to the "seedy" diapers that my daughter's produced for me during this time!!!  Oh me God.  You want to talk about going crazy!!!  I pray that you don't get that too.  Otherwise, it sounds like you're doing pretty much all you can do.  Maybe you could put a wet/damp washcloth in the freezer for him to chew on?  Try that??    But soon this too shall pass.........good luck sweetie!!  It won't last forever.   I promise.  ^_^|`|5rFua92paa	I'm going through the SAME thing with my 4 month old! Drool everywhere (LOL my little drool bucket!) and she's so fussy. The cold teethers don't work for us because I don't think she likes how her hand gets cold when holding it...what HAS helped is a wet wash cloth that she can bite...she LOVES it!
MDGRFBoRaa	The ultrasound can vary up to 10 days with what you calculate. Generally, it's best to wait until the 12th week for a dating ultrasound because it's more accurate in size and date. I wouldn't be too worried. especially considering the trans vaginal was within 6 days.
a8IRxC4raa	Mr. W, are you really a preschool teacher?<br>  <br>  Many preschool kids are terrified of the restrooms...they do fine at home and with their parents, but not at school.  It is your job to figure out how to help this boy be more comfortable, not to get angry at him.  If you plan on continuing in this career, you will be dealing with pee, poop, barf, runny noses, and blood.  So, get your anger under check and learn some compassion for four year olds.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	You need to have the parent keep this child home till he is fully potty trained. Four year old's do have the occasional accident but not every day.<br>  If this makes you feel like knocking a child's teeth down his throat, you are in the wrong profession. Please resign before you do something you may be sorry for. <br>  <br>  Oh just read anouther question where you say your a high school student ??????<br>  I think your a Troll. Get a life.<br>  <br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )|`|ZncV5gc0aa	I think he isn't fully potty trained. I'm sorry but I have a 6 yr old that "sometimes" has accidents because he's too scared to go alone or too busy playing to want to go and as long as I keep up with him make him go after breakfast, after lunch, and after snack *which I'm sure you do as a teacher, I have no problems at all. If the kid was fully potty trained it wouldn't be happening. |`|BRT2teSqaa	Pre-schools require that the students be potty trained.  Accidents do happen, but he is obviously not trained yet.  <br>  <br>  Contact the mother, and request that she take her son out of the program because it is against guidelines.  It takes away from the other student's learning when you must stop and clean him and the mess around him.  Also very unsanitary for everyone.  Call the mother ASAP.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Also, from the looks of your other questions and answers.  You are not a teacher.  You are a high school student.  What was the point of asking this?  It's not a funny question or off the wall.  It seems serious enough.  I don't get it.|`|0c330dc5c7e321c8e8dfd2f50ecea522aa	I agree he should be trained by 4. Tell the mother that he will not be allowed in class till he is. It isn't liek she coudl do anythng about beisde scontatc teh school borad and i dn;t think she would overs something so small. he is showing other kids taht it is ok which it is not.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	What happened to you being a high school student who almost got killed by some weird kid coming at you with a razor?<br>  <br>  troll!|`|AA10912211	I don't agree with the knocking a 4 year olds teeth down his throat.  However I would reconsider a teaching career if I said such things.  Boys are naturally harder to potty train than girls.  Maybe try having him go to the potty every 2 hours if it continues request the mother take the child to the doctor.  Maybe their are problems at home and it is the only way the child express himself. you could even try reading or watching a potty training video example "Potty time with Bear" |`|8oltT6Spaa	First of all, I'm so sorry about this. I work for a pre-school as well and one of the requirements for the students is that they must be potty trained to attend. Once in a while there will be accidents but that just sounds ridiculous. The director of the pre-school should have a meeting with the parents and the student might have to wait until he's 5 to go to school. Hope everything ends up alright.|`|yL3b77dhaa	First of all, have compassion for this poor baby whose mother obviously isn't spending the required time with him to teach him even the most important life skills. I agree that you should persist in telling his mother what has been happening, if she still denies your claims, have the principal contact her. Please resist your urge to be angry with the child, children are especially cognizant and sensitive to your moods. |`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	Sounds to me like the mom wanted him to go to preschool and led people to believe the boy was potty trained when he wasn't.Three weeks of accidents is not "being a kid".I would talk to the person in charge of enrollment and get him out of there.Cleaning up daily "accidents" should not be your job but the moms.|`|lXTA58vsaa	he should not be in "school" when he is not fully potty trained baybe this kid needs to start school when he is 5 and fully trained this matter must be addressed asap|`|JXa1yaXraa	I would try to find out more about his home life...scared kids often for go there training if they are feeling frightened or are being treated poorly. He could be being abused emotionally at home and that is the source of his problem. It could also be that he is not properly potty trained. I would find out if he is having the same potty issues at home as at daycare... Yes children are suppose to be "mostly to fully" potty trained before entering day care but that doesn't mean they always are, and for heaven sake your a teacher keep a level head cause you can't "knock his teeth down his throat". and on the janitor should just suck it up and do his job cause thats what he is paid to do.|`|cEw3V7Blaa	Ask him frequently if he needs to use the bathroom.  If he is there for a long time each day, make him sit on the potty at different times.  It seems like most preschools require their students to be potty-trained.  If that is the case at your school, I would bring it up with the mother and point out that a 4 year old should NOT be having habitual issues with this, and that he could get "kicked out" of school.  Suggest that she take him to the doctor.  How does she know he doesn't have a problem?  Maybe he has developed one.  It sure sounds like it!  If all else fails, make the mother clean it up!|`|rkYsrEHdaa	Tell his mom to pick it up, not really but that'd be funny, talk to your boss about it because honestly i don't think picking up **** is in your job description, besides aren't the janitors expected to clean up vomit in the lunch room? I always remember the janitor picking that crap up when one of my classmates pooped or threw up, explain how your not willing to risk getting a disease from this because really look in your contract if it ain't there don't do it,you can argue it if they try to fire you.<br>  Or have him switched to another teacher...i could honestly keep going with the reasons but i'll stop.|`|hWHNV92kaa	Poor kid. He obviously isn't potty trained, so he probably shouldn't be allowed in school, as it has become a distraction. The janitors should be cleaning it up when it happens though, as it is part of their job description.|`|Ecy1R7yNaa	The school should have a policy for dealing with this, but if you feel like knocking the teeth down a four year olds throat for any reason, maybe you're in the wrong profession.  |`|5v7l70rsaa	TRY TO GIVE HIM A PEP TALK THAT WHAT THE BATHROOM IS FOR OR  TELL HIM HE WILL START USING DIAPER IF HE DON'T STOP POOP IN HIS PANT I THINK THIS WOULD WORK|`|GLrpBS76aa	Hey Mr W...dont be to hard to judge a kid you dont know whats happening, the kid might not be toilet trained and the mother might be to shamed out to say..My son is 5 on sunday and i have been toilet training him for this for 2 long years we are going through a lot of hard ship.... it not my sons fault he cant help it.if you new everything you would understand its not nice. !!! and if i heard you talking about my son like that you would have more to worry about than cleaning up his poo....  GET HARD! try beeing in my shoes ....|`|NmQxuwBOaa	Is this is first year in a school setting. If so he may be nerves; not knowing how to handle the new surroundings. Other problems could be things at home, I would insure him that he needs to use the bathroom. Try to put up a chart and for everyday he gets a star for no accidents in his pants. At the end of the week if he has a start for each day and no accidents than give him something special maybe a small toy, an extra few minutes in his favorite area in the room. It doesn't have to be something hugh just something that motivates him to use the bathroom instead of going in his pants.
b74B4aGKaa	Mmm I love chex puppy chow! I might have to make some tonight!<br>  I've been craving cinnamon rolls. Yum!|`|hVUseUFkaa	early on in the pregnancy is was pork chops lol ( I was vegetarian)<br>  then it went to melt cheese wih bbq sauce on toast<br>  now everytime my bf goes out and asks if i want anything its a damn Freddo frog lol (the giant ones) haha.|`|a98nJlnEaa	so far i've craved alot of things.. i've craved fruit punch, chili w/ chicken, curry, shoyu potatoes w/ cucumber kimchee, ice cream cones and now its chicken pot pie.. i just ate my last pie yesterday... :-(|`|YbnMcP9yaa	No food, I crave smells.

I drank a gallon of limeade every single day! The urge to have it was overwhelming. He's two and a half now, and his favorite things is eating raw lemons! I was due with #2 yesterday, and I have also craved sour with this pregnancy, but not to the extent that I did with my first. This one is going to have my husband's taste buds. I was at the store the other day and actually thought, "I really want sausage with cheese on it", that's so something my husband would want! :) I'm a fruits, veggies, yogurt, type myself.|`|4ec27dca9c261de9c39abd8e0dd218f5aa	I craved lemon flavoured lollies with both of my pregnancies, also gingerbread, doritos and salsa, and steak.<br>  <br>  Weird because I HATE steak and lemon lollies and I very rarely eat gingerbread or salsa. I had a girl and then a boy by the way, so I don't think it determines what you'll have.|`|e798f19c1275c151df83b4aed61c0872aa	Puppy chow??? are you serious?<br>  <br>  I craved Doritos and guavas. That's about it.<br>  <br>  Whew...LOL...sorry, Mexican here, most of the time I do get things clearly, but when I read puppy chow I was surprised. Thanks for clearing that up!|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	My first craving was spring rolls ( at 4am!!)<br>  Then vegimite and cheese toast...<br>  Now its McDonalds cheese burgers (which i have EVER like before!!)<br>  Pregnancy does weird things to you!!|`|kJVjqO4Vaa	With my daughter I craved mostly for hot dogs from 7/11.Now, I'm pregnant with my second baby and I crave mostly for steak tacos.
b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Well first of all if your period is not due till the 31, I would wait till then to test.  As far as the symptoms they could all be pregnancy related or not.  Some times because you want it so bad we have the symptoms.  As with all of these questions. Only time will tell and I know that does not help when you want to know for sure right now.  Good luck I hope this was your lucky month.|`|N3IEHeIyaa	its possible but you should get 3-5 different pregnancy tests   remember they are not 100% correct you have all the signs so it could  be possible that you are pregnant|`|P42BmBudaa	I would say yes, i took 4 pregnancy test until i didn't get positive. And knew i was pregnant even tho tests were showing negative! Just take a few more|`|gwuTKiNXaa	I'm going through the same thing. I have had a negative and everything. It sounds like you are pregnant. wait another week and take another test
BG3i83dUaa	It is TOTALLY understandable!!!  From a woman also trying to conceive I will tell you I have taken a test every day from the day I ovulated!!! LOL... It can take over and totally consume your every thought!  But honestly one month is really nothing... make sure you are charting when your ovulation date is.. try going on line and doing a ovulation calculator that will give you a good estimate of when you should ovulate.  Then have intercourse every day for the four days before your expected ovulation and four days after.  Dont jump up after intercourse... just elevate your hips and relax for a bit.  Also watch your discharge consistancy...when it is very slimy like an egg white then you are most likely ovulating!!  Oh and you should start taking your prenatals at least one month before getting prego anyway so if you havent done that get started!!  :)  I know how hard it is to wait but you will be fine.  Try again next month... I know it will happen for you!!  GOOD LUCK!!! |`|Fh4B88ZGaa	You need to set more realistic expectations, or you're going to spend a lot of time being disappointed. It can take anywhere from 6-12 months for a healthy couple to conceive. After a year of trying you should see a doctor to be evaluated for fertility problems.<br>  <br>  Try to enjoy the process, and don't put so much pressure on yourself.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Feelings aren't right or wrong.  It is normal and understandable to be disappointed, but DO try to keep things in perspective.  It usually takes a few months to conceive, even if you do everything 'right.'  |`|avx7bLnKaa	if you've only been trying for a month.. don't stress so much... if you were on birtth control before it may take a while for you to get your cycles back to normal....<br>  with my first pregnancy it took me 8 months<br>  with my next planned pregnancy it took me 6-7 months<br>  <br>  stress will just make it harder to concieve...<br>  <br>  remember you only ovulate once a month.....<br>  look up charting ovulation and fertility<br>  sperm lives I think 7 days in the woman's body BUT i believe the egg is only viable 48 hrs after it is released from the ovary?|`|z6BtwSE8aa	A month is nothing. We've been trying for a year and a half with no luck.|`|MtC3CWZraa	It’s understandable, but it has really only been one cycle. That’s not long at all in the TTC world. |`|Xc02z608aa	only a month so far...don't stress so much.  Just do what you normally do and it will happen when it's supposed to.|`|AA10667190	Yes its understandable, but everyone is right, try not to stress that can hinder the process,  just enjoy the trying!!!!  Here are a few facts that may make you feel a bit better!!!  Very good luck to you, hope it happens for you soon!!!<br>  <br>  There are some interesting facts that couples should know regarding how long does it take to conceive. These facts include:<br>  <br>  - Only 25 percent of couples actually conceive within the first month of trying.<br>  - This chance is raised to 60 percent after six months of trying to conceive.<br>  - Within nine months of trying to conceive only 75 percent of couples are successful.<br>  - However the largest percentage group is with 90 percent who conceive successfully between one year and 18 months.|`|TzLe0GEEaa	It's not realiatic to expect to get pregnant your first month.  There are only about three or four days that you can optimally get pregnant each month.  You have about a 25% chance of getting pregnant each month IF you are trying during the optimal times (12 hours prior to ovulation up to 3 days after ovulation).  If you want to get pregnant faster, chart your ovulation.  But most of all, just relax and enjoy the process.  It will happen when the time is right.  Don't stress about it.|`|nZBtm3meaa	It is understandable to be dissapointed when you find out you aren't pregnant right away.  Keep in mind that it usually takes months of trying to get pregnant, and that is for people who don't have trouble concieving.  I tried for a year and a half for my first and have been trying for almost two years now for my second.  Just try to keep positive and remember to have fun.  It should be about you and your partner as much as TTC.  Good luck!  Baby dust!|`|ErCJnABBaa	From my point of view... after spending 4 years trying to concieve our 1st... NO!!! it's not understandable.<br>  <br>  Further more, get this strait right now... even if you have no infertility issues AND you manage to do the baby dance during your fertile period, you only have about a 20% chance of getting pregnant in any given month.  There are loads of other factors outside of your control, including the genetic viability of any products of conception, as well as implantation being something of a hit or miss.|`|qifANYDfaa	I actually find answers such as "It's only been one month," "It will happen when it is supposed to happen," and "An average couple takes 8 months to conceive," more hurtful than they are helpful.<br>  <br>  We hear stories about our friends and family members getting pregnant the month they begin trying, we read stories about how people conceive within the first try.  The media is full of stories about people "accidentally" getting pregnant... so why can't we?<br>  <br>  Besides, as a woman and a human being we feel we should be able to  conceive.<br>  <br>  Of course you would get your hopes up... I know mine are up.  Every single month they are up.  The first month no less hard than the second, the third, and so on.<br>  <br>  So instead of telling you (or any other woman) that how long you have waited is a means to measure how disappointed, hurt, and/or sad you are allowed to feel....<br>  <br>  I will tell you that I am right along there with you.  And that there are women all over these boards, other boards, and in your everyday life, that feel your frustration.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you <3|`|J6IOqzL0aa	a month is the shortest possible time you could get pregnant in from when you start trying so i think you need to be a little more realistic and understand that most people can take up to a year if not more to  get pregnant. its all about timing and luck.  Keep trying it will happen for you but just realise it might take a little longer than expected. Apparently only young teenage girls who have sex once without a condom get pregnant first time.  Everyone else has to keep at it|`|z5SeIQtwaa	sometimes it takes a healthy couple up to a year don't be stress out yet ..|`|ZoYPbHj3aa	I hate to burst your bubble, but!!!!!!!! after you have been trying for 8 months then write back.  <br>  <br>  That is not enough time to try and get sympathy from anyone.  <br>  Give me a break!!!!!!!!
bAp35x7uaa	Hmm...  morally no; biologically, yes.      Unfortunately our bodies say one thing while our society says something different.  Ideally, you shouldn't be physically capable of having a child until you're 20 or emotionally ready but try telling your body that!      Unfortunately we live in a day and age where people are quick to judge and pretty ignorant - at 13 years of age, that's gonna be quite tough to handle.  That's why it's better to wait until a time when you are emotionally able to handle a child.|`|QhVCn7rsaa	Normal is not a word i would use to describe that situation, but if that the situation you are in, then i suggest you have a lot to learn.

I am so sick of all these teens!!  I'm sorry!  But seriously....why are you having sex in the 1st place?!!  You obviously do not respect yourself otherwise you would wait!    It's just so sickening!  And so many poor babies are born to these little girls who can't even take care of themselves, so their poor parents have to do everything!  It is not that hard to be responsible.  Do you really think it's worth it to possibly ruin your whole life for a few minutes of pleasure?  Learn to say "no"!!  It's not that big of a word!!  And no...it's not normal!

paLhHGmcaa	I wouldn't fight over taking her pacifier away. It may even help comfort her more than anything else you could give her at bed time, I would just try and restrict use to bedtimes. My daughter's(4, 3, 1.5, and 6 months preggo) all do their own exaggerated dances before passing out. Usually reading a book, or 2 or 3 will convince my animals that it's time to sleep. Sometimes I find the more boring the book the faster they drop. Other than that, I just keep things dark and as quiet as possible. Hard when 2 are bouncing off their beds and the baby is watching from her crib.    We deal with them getting up and out a lot of nights, but the times that I'm most successful is when I stick to a routine and schedule... dinner, brushing teeth, read a book, bed. And if they can't follow the rules then no stories, no nightlights, and if they're being especially bad I'll threaten to not let them brush their teeth(luckily they get excited enough about it that this is actually a punishment!). When they feel like they're being rewarded for doing what they're supposed to be doing, they usually don't put up as much of a fight as when we just usher them off to their room and call "Good night" after them.    Just my experience, good luck with your daughter.|`|AA10972821	Like everyone else is saying let her have the pacifier, at least until she is able to go to bed with no problems.  Also, you may want to try a night light, soothing music (my son loves James Blunt for some reason!) and maybe even stay in the room with her until she drifts off.  Let her know that you are right there if she needs you....I know it's hard but it takes time.|`|dm6K4xRGaa	She is evidentl aware of the move and the change of her room and her bed, adding the bear may not be good until she is already calming down over the move . My experience is that the change of room color the change of bed nad the unfamiliar home may all be part of the puzzle. Try playing with her so she is a little more tires, and maybe consider the painting of the room to a color closer matching her old surroundings. My children after moving were very aware of the changes ,so some things were needed to stay the same for comforts sake. On both sides hers and yours,and for sanity you may have to reinstall the crib ,for a short time, as too many changes may be causing the problems.|`|keaeuczRaa	Her screaming and banging on the door is ridiculous and she should get punshied!! it may be very hard but mabey give her a tap on the butt, get in her face BUT very gently make your face stern and say you need to stop and go to bed. If she continues, if she has an activity or a favorite toy you take this away and if she still continues........ no offense but you should go to a parenting counceler, and if it goes that far your are getting a big sign that she ia a just a tad spoiled. With the pacifier, you use the pacifier fairy when pacifier fairy comes and the pacifier goes away the fairy brings lots of toys or lots of candy!!!! GOOD LUCK!!!!!1|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Too much change at once.  Give her back the pacifier until she's feeling better about the bed.  You might even make a deal with her that she can have the binky if she stays in bed.  One step at a time.    You also might want to try, "Teddy is tired and needs to sleep" and see if she buys that.|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	my son did the same thing you just have keep with it i know its alot of work put her to bed at the same time every night and she will get used to it dont keep going in and checking on her because then it jusst starts all over again|`|62R21NzNaa	How old is your daughter? You should ease her into it with her pacifier because doing both extremes at the same time can cause frustration for her.      Are you closing her bedroom door? Maybe block the door with a baby gate instead.  Also, do you have a nightlight in there? She will get the hang of it if you keep doing what your doing. good luck!|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	You need to realize that your child is going through a lot of changes right now.  A move can be very confusing for a child, and to have the bed (crib) she is used to sleeping in and a pacifier taken away at the same time might be traumatizing her.    Honestly, while I am not a fan of pacifiers I recommend giving it back for the time being.  If possible, set the crib up also.  Then, try to get her to take daytime naps in the toddler bed but put her in the crib at night.  Slowly transition to the toddler bed at night, after she has had a chance to get used to her new home.  Then work on that pacifier!  One big change at a time is more than enough for a little one.    Also, she might not like the teddy bear-perhaps it scares her?|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	You didn't say how old she is, is it possible that she doesn't quite understand the concept of staying in her bed and going to sleep on her own yet?     If she is old enough to understand this concept just have a discussion with her prior to her every night bedtime routine about how when you put her to bed she has to stay in her bed and go to sleep if she wants to continue to be a "big girl" and sleep in her "big girl bed". This helped when we moved my daughter to her toddler bed. She moved into it on her 2nd birthday and is almost 3 now and goes to bed great. She never threw tantrums when we put her in bed but she was able to open the door and come out which she did a lot at first.|`|hcRGqk2gaa	There's too much going on for her. You've moved, trying to take her pacifier and putting her in a new bed. One thing at a time. I think the best solution if it's possible is to move the toddler bed in the room with you and let her fall asleep with the pacifier. That way if she opens her eyes, she will know that you're there. Take the pacifier out at night when she's unaware. Work her into her room. Get her excited to have her own room and bed. Good Luck.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	Keep doing what you are doing. She is trying to push you. Just do as you said it may take a few days but she will get the hint and stop. Dont give in|`|c9NuCZnaaa	try not to do 2 things at once. let her keep her pacifier and work on the sleeping first. Before you put her to bed, ake sure theres a routine so she gets used to it. shower then brush teeth then read her a book for example. that way when she does these things in the evening she realises it's time to sleep soon.   When she does get out of bed. first time say to her nicely  "It's time to go to sleep now" and pick her up and place her in the bed.  if she does it again say it firmer  "you HAVE to sleep now" but dont yell...just firm. and put her back in bed  After that. dont say anything to her. just pick her up and place her back in her bed. When she realises it's not getting her anywhere she'll fall asleep. It may take a while but keep at it. don't give in and after a few nights she'll go out really quickly.
XiT8q49Daa	check with your doctor to increase your dosage..also, try excercising or doing something really tiring the night before so that you could get to bed early..you'd feel better the next day...|`|ySKK7lCyaa	talk to your Dr. about getting your dosage increased.|`|etzhw4j7aa	higher dose|`|8chxrFFQaa	Eating well and exercising well can help you concentrate. Drinking enough water can also help the brain. If that doesn't work, see your doctor and see if you can get a higher dosage.
nzY94B7waa	I found out I was pregnant when I was 17 and had my daughter when I was 18.  It is VERY hard, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  Having and raising your child is the most rewarding experience.  She is now 7 and I have a 3 1/2 year old and my 3rd is due in August.    In the end you have to decide what to do.  You also have to live with that decision forever.  Think long and hard before doing anything you might regret.|`|AA10186411	Too bad.  You should have thought about that before you laid down and had sex.  Time to grow up and be a mother!|`|PhkLLwVbaa	I got pregnant at 16 and was 17 when my baby boy was born I was scared just like you my bf was just a year older than me. I had him because I could not bring myself to give him up i'm so glad I didn't i'm not saying it was easy financially it wasn't but the mom part was amazing I was afraid because of my age that I wouldn't make a good mom but i'm an amazing mom and by having him young I have such a special bond with him. I went into home schooling because he was born in dec and I wasn't supposed to graduate till may by going into home schooling I graduated in feb I was done with my schooling in jan but it takes a few weeks anyways i'm now 19 I will be 20 in july and i'm expecting twin girls at the end of march. I'm not telling you that you have to keep your baby but me getting rid of my son would have been the biggest mistake of my life he is my world he is amazing and has taught me so much. Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|a732cc20369212fe385773a398cdf5b8aa	ITS YOUR DECISION you can give your baby up for adoption if you feel you cannot give the baby all that it needs or get an abortion if you think carrying it for nine months and then giving it up will be too hard. wither wa its your choice, you know yourself and if you are ready to have a child and if you can care for it the way you need to. go with what your gut tells you. good luck|`|fE5zMOfJaa	You just deal!  You'll be fine!  It will be hard...but that's the responsibility you take on when you decide to have sex.  Try not to focus on the negatives but be positive!  And enjoy the experience.

zhJOZhKEaa	Normally, your child can only have a blood type of 'O' if they get an 'O' allele from each parent.  In this case the father has no 'O' to give.  The mother has a 'B' and an 'O'... the father has an 'A' and a 'B'... so it is unlikely.    You can 'play' with this in this blood type calculator: http://www.biology.arizona.edu/human_bio...    *However*... there are very rare cases of blood type mutations that do not completely rule out this possiblity.  I would have a DNA test done if there is any question.|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	well me and my husband have o + blood and my daughter was born with A type blood go figure lol|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	me and my baby have O positive, not sure what my husband is.|`|PbBWJGsTaa	No.    Ignoring the rhesus +'s    mother's blood group is BO (i know that because you said the maternal grandfather has group O blood)    father's is  AB    To be blood group O, you have to inherit two copies of the O gene.  The mother has one, but the father does not.|`|leGfABH4aa	it is possible, just not as common as having one of the parents. blood type can actually skip generations, just like any other gene out there. my blood type isn't the same as either of my parents, but i know i'm my dads b/c i look like him|`|o2ehEqinaa	Both my parents are A+ and I was born 0+
EzkGVZ1Yaa	If you are looking to conceive a child with your new husband, you need to consult a doctor. You have many factors to deal with including age, the condition of your tubes, egg quality and so on . . .     The doctor needs to check the condition of your tubes to see if it is possible to repair and reconnect them. They may be beyond repair meaning that you will never be able to conceive a child naturally . . . BUT - don't lose hope. There are other options including IVF. If you go the route of IVF, you may have to accept that at your age . . . you might not have a good egg to conceive a child and may need to consider using a donor egg. This will give you the opportunity to carry and give birth to a child . . . the only thing is that it will not be genetically yours . . . but it can be your husbands.    Science is amazing and there are options out there . . .but you will not know what is available to you until you meet with a fertility specialist. I also recommend that you seek counseling. There are counselors and support groups that specialize in infertility . . .you are going to need to be in a good emotional place if you opt to go through with a tubal reversal or IVF cycle.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Burnt?  Your tubes have been burned?  How did that happen?  I mean, anything's possible, but it sounds unlikely that such a person would be able to conceive.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	there is always a chance, but it is very very very very small. if you have your tubes tied and want to concieve your best bet is to go to a fertility specialist.       good luck =]|`|QufZeqlVaa	no|`|QhVCn7rsaa	I doubt it.

If it continues, see your family practitioner, who may recommend physical therapy to ease the process.
