zwJbUbWMaa	They can attempt to turn him from the outside before you deliver but my sister in law had to do this and she said it hurts like hell.  Hopefully in the next few days he will turn on his own.  If not you might want to prepare yourself for a c-section.  Good luck!|`|UtOVEzG3aa	what's back labor??? you guys using terms scared me, is there a back labor??? OMG! now I am freaking out!|`|zuZKj3xXaa	same here.. shes not in THAT position.. but shes sideways digonal in my belly lol he flipped her head down tho :) and shes dropping wonderfully!<br>  <br>  Before you start pushing, but when your dilating, the doctor can and MIGHT reach up in there and turn him around for you. its kinda painful.....but worth it.<br>  <br>  <br>  39 weeks today!!|`|OPTDFRuzaa	it would be hard for baby to turn not as there is so little room left. i will keeo my finger crossed though =D good luck and yes you would have back labour and may take longer because of the postion.|`|AA12240972	Yes he could turn and probably will at this point and all labor is back labor (lol).  Way to scare a new mom by telling her you've never seen something like that, I'd say she lacks bedside manner.|`|AA10745032	u might have to have a c section with no pain|`|3NoDjKLoaa	back labor is common in most labors... no matter what position the baby is in.. my son was facing the right way and all i had was back labor..your baby could turn, you could try out some different positions to try to get him to turn, the doctor may try to turn him, himself.  Otherwise you are looking at a csection.|`|wZtv16syaa	Babies move positions all the time. If your doctor was worried they would have mentioned it to you or taken care of it right then. Anyone can have back labor and trust me it SUCKS! Good luck and congrats.

So be careful!|`|WB7sFVxAaa	when in doubt, take a test<br>  <br>  and then<br>  <br>  <br>  go to the doctor|`|AGlpdpAKaa	they can be pregnancy signs, but if you only ovulated on sunday you woudn't be experiencing this yet.  it takes usually at least a week for the egg to implant.  the bleeding could be ovulation spotting, or maybe somethign else . who knows, perhaps you are pregnant! wait and see if your next period is late.  don't test before your period is due, cause you'll probably end up with a false negative.  wait until the day of or the day after your period is due, then take a test :)|`|zhk8o514aa	:drops my spoon:<br>  <br>  Care for the rest of my tomato soup?|`|yMTCaB8qaa	i have no idea! i have no idea! i have no idea! but i think so!
ZDqdYhdGaa	If you are at risk for a uterine rupture or some other complication than yes. Your doctor will tell you what is best for you and the baby. However if you aren't at any real risk than it is best to wait. The babies lungs are the last thing to develop, usually completing the development process during the last month. Having the baby at 36 weeks obviously takes out the last month of development making a chance that there could be problems. <br>  <br>  As for the medical professional who is recommending it, unless he/she is a licensed OB and is treating you, they don't know what is best for you and your baby. It doesn't hurt to mention your concern to your doctor, but in the end your doctor knows what is best and is the opinion you should count on.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	36 is too early i would say 37 at the most- some babies are ok at 36 weeks but some are not and some need to be in the NICU. obviously your health care professional has the decision on this one but i think 37-38 they would be mroe likely to do it unless there were some serious issues|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Why is this medical professional not your Dr? I would bring this person's theory to your Dr, and see how your Dr responds.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i was advised not to do it that early, 38 weeks was the earliest.  I was told that uterine rupture isnt really a concern in early early labor only during the intense stages and pushing, and if i started having contractions to head the hospital and they would perform the c- section then but that they wouldnt schedule it until 38-39 weeks because of the possible health risks of the baby being to early.  i would double check with the doctor that is treating you for this pregnancy, i am sure this other person wants whats best for you but the doctor that you are seeing has been following you more closely and will know best what is right for your situation.  good luck.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	yes because if your uterus ruptures and they cant stop the bleeding in time you will die. if they do you will need a blood transfusion and perhaps a historectomy which means having no more kids. i know this because my sis in law nearly died when she went into labour naturally and had to a an emergency c section and she lost 6 pints of blood and nearly died and needed a blood transfusion so next baby she is having will have to be a c section which is a shame.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	If your doctor said that it was best then you should do it. They are professionals and know what is best for you and your baby.|`|QTWGaT6gaa	I would voice your concerns to your doctor. It's likely you may get your wish at 37 or 38 wks, but I doubt at 36 wks they will do it. Are you getting your tubes tied as well?|`|wZtv16syaa	Personally I believe that your doctor has been with you throughout your pregnancy, knows your history and knows the risks of uterine rupture also so if he/she thinks that it is necessary would advise you to that also. But if you feel like your doctor has not addressed the issue with you then by all means at least ask. Good luck with all 5!!
WIEPISyeaa	Prometrium can help to thicken your uterine lining and up your chances of hanging onto an embryo if it implants.  Clomid has a tendency to thin lining, so Prometrium just counteracts it.  It's probably not a bad idea to take it after ovulation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|H9t63i4Kaa	I agree with still waiting, It sounds like a good idea to me!!!!!
AA12127693	My son's diagnosis was just changed to ODD from DBD (disruptive behavior disorder)...on top of ADHD.  Charts (amazingly) do not work with him.  We have a very strict routine that he follows amazingly well -as well as a discipline schedule.  We only allow so much time with Video games / tv he gets very little of - if not he would be in front of a screen all day long without moving!  He is only 7 and is still in that "I want to help" phase which is saving my sanity everyday - so he helps cook / clean / brush and walk dogs anything to keep his little mind wandering and active to combat the massive fits that he can get into.  We have him in therapy and he sees a phycologist on top of all of it.<br>  <br>  WOW - Celar - amazing how you are so well educated but still believe that every disorder is BS.  Let me tell you something - my son DOES have behavior issues - but they stem from an absent / drug abusing mother who lost her rights to him.  This IS real to him and his little mind doesn't know how to handle the ANGER that he deals with.  I am VERY happy that you have the perfect little angel - we aren't talking about children who act like children and misbehave - we are talking about a disorder that DOES exhist as I see it almost daily in my home!|`|w9TzZCt8aa	my brother is Special needs|`|3WWHWsHOaa	My 10 yr old son has ADHD, ODD and OCD. Quite the tricky combinaton. Routine and scheduling help a great deal but using it without incorporating new rituals is a tricky task.<br>  <br>  Edit: cellar door if you didn't even know what ODD is how the hell can you have an opinion on what a child with ODD needs? Ignorance is not an opinion and you are not entitled to it.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	(I think by posting this link, I have adequetely educated myself about the "disorder")<br>  <a href="http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_families/children_with_oppositional_defiant_disorder" rel="nofollow">http://www.aacap.org/cs/root/facts_for_f...</a><br>  <br>  I have never heard of this, does this sufficiently describe what he has? In my opinion, the kid is just a brat and needs an *** whooping. <br>  <br>  EDIT: I have a college-level psychological background and I am truly disguted at all the disorders and syndromes. Everybody who has a quirk has a diagnosable syndrome or disorder. Doesn't anyone wonder why all of a sudden these diagnoses' exist? To make money for pharmacutical companies and private therapy practices. Its all BS.<br>  <br>  And to answer your question, yes I am a parent. My child has no diagnosable disorders, personality disorders, on any medications and is a very happy well-adjusted child with no discipline problems- he receives punishment when he misbehaves.<br>  <br>  EDIT#2: No, he's no angel. Trust me. My point is to try to clarify to you that maybe your child is just more difficult than many. But to diagnose and claim he is in some way inferior or requires medication or therapy is excessive. I do not believe that. Based on the definition of this disorder, I have about 5 friends who's children have it as well. How about 100 years ago? Do you recall ever hearing accounts of this disorder? Didn't think so ;)
WIEPISyeaa	Well, I've heard that over-doing it can be counter-productive (ie it doesn't give your hubby enough time to regenerate his sperm count.)  I've heard that you can do it as often as every day, or as little as every other day....but you really shouldn't do it more than once a day (maybe twice) or it's not doing any good. <br>  <br>  I'm on 50 mg clomid days 3-7 this month.  We BD'd almost every day, but at least every other and I think that that might do the trick. :)  (Assuming I ovulated.... :))<br>  <br>  A couple other tips:  After you BD, put your hips up on a pillow for 15 minutes or so, just to help gravity let those little swimmers get deeper. :)  Also, some advice I got from a friend who recently got a BFP...tell your DH to "hold it in" as long as he can before he...you know....lets it go, because this is supposed to give it a little more pressure and help "shoot" the sperm further up. :)  (I hope I put that delicately. ;)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!  Clomid baby dust to us both!!!!|`|smsUZG4Iaa	well ill tell ya if you BD every other day youll be covered for ovulation and it wont lower your hubbys sperm count|`|H9t63i4Kaa	Having sex every 2 days will give the sperm time enough to build up again, when my sister in law was trying on her first round of clomid, they would have sex every 2 days and 1 hour before they did the BD, they would place a cold compress on his testicles, and then get frisky to warm him up and get him in the mood, and then do the BD, the cold compress helps to build sperm count!

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	She has "nipple confusion" otherwise more accurately known as bottle-preference (or breast preference when the baby refuses bottles instead).  Most babies with nipple confusion will accept the non-preferred choice when they are sleeping.<br>  <br>  Also at about 4 months babies become more distractible, and generally you can see more when bottle-feeding than breastfeeding.  Though I have found many breastfeeding positions that let the baby see more of the world so they will actually nurse.  The easiest is for mom to lie on her back on the couch and baby to lie on her side with her back resting on the back of the couch (or mom's arm against the back of the couch depending on size of baby, size of mom's breasts, etc).  <br>  <br>  A 4 month old is old enough to drink from a cup (actually a newborn can drink from a cup BTDT) but 4-6 months is a common age to introduce a cup or sippy cup rather than a bottle.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Help -- My Baby Won't Nurse! <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby/back-to-breast.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/baby...</a><br>  <br>  Wakeful 4 Month Olds<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/4mo-sleep.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/...</a><br>  <br>  The Distractible Baby<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/distractible-baby.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/dis...</a><br>  <br>  Late Nipple Confusion<br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org//NB/NBMarApr99p43.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org//NB/NBMarApr99p43.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Nursing Through Confusion<br>  <a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/bf/confusion.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/b...</a>|`|9hggEdf1aa	Try breastfeeding her when she is really hungry.

Good luck|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	Maybe just Don't give her a bottle in the evenings or on weekends. She obviously knows how to breastfeed, but chooses not to. She also will not starve herself.

Or do you mean - learn to build a fire, kill a hog, and make a house out of leaves?<br>  <br>  I think both are great skills to learn.<br>  <br>  So, No. It is not wrong to teach your child how to be a survivor.|`|7e9bce7df6b13d448cd20f1bff3d3cf3aa	IT depends - in what context?<br>  <br>  The thing is, if you 'arm' your child to be a 'survivor', their initial thoughts on the world around them will be that 'it's a war out there' or 'it's a bad evil place where the odds are against me'. Even though you and I know that sometimes this may seem the case, we still want our kids to feel positive and safe whilst having the confidence to know that they can explore out of our safety net with ease but with the knowledge and comfort that we are still there for them.<br>  <br>  Being a 'survivor' is a little extreme. However, being strong and logical whilst keeping your wits about you will get you pretty far with that subconscious 'survival instinct' without it being too obvious or a primary sense.<br>  <br>  We want to create a protective sense of being and assertivenesss, not fear and a placid nature.|`|w9TzZCt8aa	no it will teach them how to stand up for themselves and not let anyone else take the mick out of them|`|OpVysSzQaa	I don't see why not. why do you ask?

12d2985d31f5412abf063b81b892a2d5aa	I would first ask my doctor but it is okay to take him off the one with DHA and ARA. These are added nutrients that are not really needed being that the body makes its own. These are added to formula so that companies can say that they are similar to breast milk, which nothing really is. <br>  <br>  Always talk with your doctor before changing formulas. <br>  My son was on Nestle Good Start with Dha and ARA when born. We found out he did not take too well to the DHA and ARA. He was constantly having tummy issues and diarrhea. <br>  <br>  Reason::These nutrients are made synthetically and are derived from algea/fungus!<br>  <br>  He is now on the regular Nestle Good Start without the DHA/ARA and better than ever!|`|vue9NOhYaa	There is no real evidence that the added ARA/DHA in formula has any benefit.  If he's doing well on the formula there's no reason to change it.  OTOH, if it's upsetting his tummy, or is too costly, he can have any formula that agrees with him.  (DHA/ARA aren't found in normal foods, so his solid diet, unless you're offering foods that are specifically fortified with it, make no difference in his intake.)|`|abT0o6hHaa	Ive always understood that they are suppose to be on formula with DHA and ARA until or year old (or breast milk of course). This is their primary source of nutrition.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Only fish, plankton, algae and certain oils contain DHA or ARA which are important to brain development.<br>  <br>  On the other hand the DHA and ARA found in formula are highly processed and may actually be bad for baby, they certainly cause a lot of side effects in infants.|`|5EFc1QYbaa	For the first year formula and/or breastmilk is your babies main source of nutrition and should still be the staple of his diet.  Check with your peidatrician before making any changes with his formula.  They may have him on this special formula for a reason.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I think it would be fine, especially since he is eating baby food. I would discuss it with his doctor before switching his formula. It can be easy to find the right formula with your doctors help!|`|c3eb9cc5af710aa695ddf32e0b5e463aaa	DHA and ARA are essential fatty acids... in other words, they are a form of fat. They are a very -special- form of fat, though, in that they are what are called "long-chain fatty acids" or "essential fatty acids". The body can't make these itself, and depends on sources in the diet in order to provide these for the body.<br>  <br>  These fatty acids are also critical for the development of things that are growing -very- fast in babies, like nerve cells (in particular, the brain). Unless your son is being supplemented some other way, one of the best things you can do for him while his brain is still growing so much (nerve cells in the brain increase by over 10,000 times the number at birth in the first 5 years) is to keep him on the DHA/ARA supplemented formula.<br>  <br>  The greatest source -anywhere- of ARA is breast milk, and as the baby gets older and the volume of breast milk consumed decreases, the percentage of fatty acids in what -is- consumed increases, as long as mom is getting enough in her diet. If you -do- want to go off the formula, make sure that his diet has -lots- of sources of long-chain fatty acids. Wild-caught salmon, egg yolks, deep-sea halibut are good sources of DHA. ARA, though, is -very- hard to find in foods, so since you aren't breastfeeding, if it were my child, I'd leave him on the DHA/ARA formula until he was a year old, and then switch over to a DHA/ARA supplemented toddler beverage (the same as I would recommend to a mom who stopped nursing at a year).
AA11085356	When the baby first starts to 'show', it kind of below your belly button. But once he starts getting bigger, it's your whole belly! You belly button will stick out!

The baby starts low and as it grows your uterus expands up. Each week of pregnancy corresponds closely to the measurement of your uterus in centimeters.<br>  <br>  At some point the uterus is at the level of your belly button and then it continues to expand. Depending on the size of your torso the baby might take up more or less room. My belly is now rounding out just under my breasts. My belly measured 31 centimeters at 32 weeks!!<br>  <br>  I didn't show until I was close to 6 months. Before that my belly was bigger but just kind of soft and mushy.

The uterus doesn't reach the belly button till around 20 weeks.|`|QTWGaT6gaa	Depends on how far along you are. It's where the uterus is, and the uterus stretches as baby grows.|`|jZPv153Jaa	its a bit lower like where your abdomen area like the place where you get cramps at during your period|`|ucbEyEApaa	This is such a cute question. I have no idea.
WIEPISyeaa	You could have enough HCG, but you may not as well.  That sounds like it could have been implantation, but it would probably still take a couple of days to generate ENOUGH HcG to show up on a home pregnancy test (most can't detect it until it's at a certain level.)<br>  <br>  I have really irregular cycles, and so it's really difficult for me to figure out when I'm "expecting" AF, so I just usually tell myself to wait until day 30, and then test and see what happens.  It's to heartbreaking to test early, because you test and then you just tell yourself "Oh it's too early...." and crush yourself either way.<br>  <br>  I would wait until Sunday, and if AF doesn't show, I would use first morning urine on Monday to test.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Lots of baby dust to us both!!!|`|9a3sNrEqaa	you could try to test!!!!!! But HCG usually doubles around every 48 hours. But If your like me you will test now!!!!! GOOD LUCK HUN!!!!!! TONS OF BABY DUST!!!!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	if you are pregnant, you are right your hormones will be increasing quickly after implantation, its still a little early because you havent missed AF yet but it wouldnt hurt to try, i got a positive test 5 days before my missed period with my recent pregnancy, worse case its neg and you can retest in a few days.  Those tests are not always accurate before AF but sometimes they work so try it, if you are you will know and if neg then you still could be. good luck
q4rG5Dwtaa	After her first set of shots. I wouldn't not wait till she's 6 months old, you need to do them really early so she will be used to them and not want to pull at them. I did Emily's at 8 weeks old, she's now 5 years old and I have never had a problem with them, she loves them.<br>  <br>  edit: also make sure they don't get snagged on her clothes, and be sure to clean and turn them, I would do this everynight till she got a little bit older.<br>  <br>  edit: its sad how judging some moms are, I sure hope they don't judge their kids this way when they decide to make a decision life that they don't agree with.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	lol!  Love the ones who have to criticize.  No babies are NOT dolls, but learn to pick your battles.  This is hardly something to basically call other woman a bad mother.<br>  To answer your question I had both my daughters ears pierced at about 3 months old.  I got it done at Claires, and everything turned out great.  No infections, and most importantly they didn't constantly mess with them like a 5 or an 8 year old would do, which can hinder the healing|`|nhgQKvwEaa	How ridiculous, I'm not even going to bother with this question. Go ahead and put your newly born daughter through unnecessary pain, just because you think it looks "cute" or "stylish". Why not wait until the girl is old enough to voice her opinion on that???|`|yCwPxulYaa	Where I live, the baby has to be at least 8 weeks and have there first set of shots.  <br>  <br>  I got my daughters done at 3 months and she did great.  She didn't even cry.  She has never messed with them and I have been able to make sure that they stay clean.  I had hers done at a piercing place in the mall (Piercing Pagoda) where they used a disposable gun and the lady DID was her hands.<br>  <br>  I guess I am horrible mom for deciding to get my daughters ears pierced *rolls eyes* and I wish people would just leave their opinions to their self.  I dont think you ask SHOULD I GET MY BABIES EARS PIERCED?|`|pCZPtegeaa	I know in Colorado, the baby has to be 2 months with 2 month shot records. I wanted to do it, but chose not to yet.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  -------------------<br>  I love the thumbs down for answering the question. But those that don't bother to answer the actual question and decide to basically call the mothers who pierce their daughters' ears idiots, expect a million thumbs up. How naive.|`|NHF98xDwaa	my baby is 5 months old and i just got hers done at a place called peircing pagoda... she didnt even cry at all, i dont even think she realized it was done..but anyways i advise you to please wait until your daughter has gotten her 4 month shots which includes a tetanus shot... dont get her peired b4 that..and to everyone who says it's wrong or evil, dont pay that any mind, there's absolutly nothing wrong with peircing your baby's ears, everyone should worry about there own kids.|`|3NoDjKLoaa	if it is possible to get it done at the hospital i would do it there.. too many places that do ear piercing use dirty needles or "guns" i always got an infection from going to a place.. you can just tell your doctor.. It would be the most sanitary.. plus like others have mentioned.. the baby wont be moving around a lot and will forget the pain.. it will be easier to clean and care for.|`|XSmkmwohaa	I got my daughters ears peirced at around 2 months, After her Vaccines. I love the time i got them done, because she was too young to pull/play with them. They never got infected, And i cleaned them two or three times a day. I hate that people judge about ear peircing. If you want to get it done, Its your choice. No one elses. Ear peircing will never "go out of Style", Your daughter will feel pretty with them, And if for some reason she doesnt want them when shes older- She can take them out. Go for it, if that is your decision. Dont worry about other peoples Ignorance.|`|ivhnVbbraa	My first daughter I got hers done at Claire's at 1. She did not cry at all. My second daughter I waited for her to ask, because my family thought it was mean. So my second daughter asked at 4 and she did a wonderful job as well. My step daughter is 6 and just got hers done and was fine as well. All 3 girls got it done at Claire's. They are good, safe and sanitary. I personally liked doing my first daughters at 1 or younger.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	The sooner the better when she is old enough to move her head it will make it harder to clean & do<br>  wen she is little she wont feel it as bad|`|ckxpknr0aa	Just my opinion but babies with pierced ears is awful!<br>  <br>  Let her decide when she's older rather than making her look chavvy/trashy!|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	There certainly are differences in cultures. For example, in some African cultures, they do all sorts of amazing things starting at a very early age, makeup and jewelry and head dresses, piercings and the like. A few earrings on a baby in our culture is totally acceptable. There will always be nay sayers, and they certainly can make their own choices as parents. For me, I'd say yes, and I'm pretty sure you will do the right thing to take good care of your daughter. I'm also sure that the medical professionals will advise you best on any aspect of this process.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	I got my daughters done at Claires when she was three months old. They use a disposable gun and I watched her wash her hands. I'm a bit anal so I even counted how long she washed her hands for and if it hadn't been the full thirty seconds I would of asked her to wash them longer. My daughter never had any issues with her's. <br>  <br>   I've never heard if them being done in the hospital, but your pediatrician might do them.<br>  <br>  And as far as letting her decide when she's older, that's great. But have you ever known anyone who was mad at their mother for getting their ears pierced as a baby?

y6g0RnuAaa	Well most likely designed by a man who never had "mommy brain!"

DRb4Qlypaa	I started my period when I was 7 going on 8, but I didn't have to shave until I was like 13. It is the same with guys. They don't get it all at the same time. They may produce sperm before their voice changes, and they may start shaving their face before they produce sperm.<br>  Just all depends on the individual.<br>  There is some speculation though, as several boys are now saying that they slept with her around the same time, too. So they are doing DNA testing. He may not even be the father. If he isn't, his reputation is still ruined. It is a very sad situation.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Yes they can have sperm at 12  - I do wonder about it in this case though because he is such a small and young-looking 13 year old and must have been even smaller 9 months ago. The results of the DNA test would have been interesting, sadly due to the recent gag order on the case we'll probably never know!<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	Just as some girls start their menstrual cycle that early, boys can be fertile that early.  It happens.|`|i8Ch743Laa	sometimes,they get it early. Same as girls with periods.|`|3NoDjKLoaa	boys do start creating sperm at about 12.. sometimes a little younger.. boys can ejaculate even earlier (just might not have sperm in it) usually around the time puberty hits which is coming on younger and younger these days, even for females.|`|XRX6vKNmaa	It is possible for boys to have sperm at that age.

Social has round the clock help. While it is true that they have more staff on during the day, well emergencies happen. So she COULD be telling the truth.|`|vqmAaT7gaa	she is lying. And if she is still living with her ex, she is probably lying to you about more than just that.|`|JClRxC8iaa	Why would you even date someone who is still living with their ex? That's bad news.|`|ucbEyEApaa	she's living with her ex husband? but pregnant with your kid?<br>  I'm not allowed to judge but...huh?
t4HXotwEaa	My new internal alarm clock is set for 4:30 AM.  It is very obnoxious because i am exhausted by about 1:00 PM.  This is my third pregnancy and i never had this before.  I have been trying to stay up a little later at night.  The crazy thing though is when i wake up in the morning i am completely refreshed?!  I have been sleeping like the dead.  Hopefully this is short lived because i only have more six months of possible good sleep...and i want it!|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	I've been going through this- I don't even need to set my alarm clock anymore. I rarely sleep past 6:30, and this morning I was up at 5. Not sure what is causing it, but I know that insomnia in pregnancy is not uncommon. Just another lovely pregnancy development!|`|miPubuDYaa	I think that is just normal. Before i was pregnant i would every morning wake up at 2:30 for no reason other than i just woke up.<br>  <br>  If you can't fall back asleep and it making your day bad due to lack of sleep. Go to bed a little later each night. Until you don't wake up in the middle of the night.<br>  <br>  I wake up about every hour & half now that i'm 29 weeks because i'm very unconfortable with back pain. Some nights i wake up at 2:00 And just look at the clock all night until i get up at 6:00 to get the little one ready for school.<br>  <br>  Trust me when the baby comes and you have to get up to feed him. You will some how adjust. I used to do everything with my eyes close literary. And i would take naps when my daughter did.|`|AA10953561	Yep, I went through this almost exactly! Starting around 15 weeks I would wake up at 2AM for a bathroom break, then again around 4AM and I wouldn't be able to go back to sleep. It was exhausting. Now days, I still wake up around 2AM and 4AM almost every night. I think it's your body reacting to your little one moving. My baby girl is always moving at 4AM.<br>  <br>  My sister-in-law has a theory that if you wake up regularly at the same time that's around the time your baby will come. I don't know, this is my first pregnancy, but I'll be finding out within the next nine weeks or so.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your pregnancy!|`|AA10147946	I've been up like, 4-8 times EVERY SINGLE NIGHT since about 8 weeks.  Mostly it's to pee, and at least once I have to get up and eat something because I'm that hungry.  I'm 10w4d right now, with no relief in sight.<br>  <br>  I've heard of the baby preparing you for a schedule before he/she's born, so that could very well be the issue, especially if it's not your bladder or stomach waking you.|`|1X4Rbrvxaa	I'm 9 months pregnant and I cannot tell you how many times my "sleep schedule" changed throughout the pregnancy. You really just have to roll with it. I went from waking up at certain times. To waking up once a night. Then I would wake up atleast once an hour. Now I barely sleep at all and I am up by 730am when I am resting. So yeah being pregnant and sleeping sucks but your body gets used to it. Good luck!|`|3236f5358eeeaca5a9260bfc660166abaa	Yes, Insomnia is normal.  I had that with both my kids, but more so the closer I got to the due date.|`|2HeHPHaoaa	do you have to get up and pee at this time? you might just be getting uncomfortable because of your growing belly. make sure you are sleeping on your left side because it gets more oxygen to your baby and it might be more comfortable if you get a body pillow to kind of hug and wrap your legs around at night. =]|`|zCqtnImUaa	I had my baby 6 months ago, but every night I would wake up too. It's so weird. I woke up about 4 times a night. I am still trying to get back to normal. I only do it about once a night now, and the sad thing is, my baby sleeps better than me. lol. I have no idea why I would wake up so much. and my doctor didn't know why either.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	maybe it is your body getting ready. when i had my first i was up and down all through the night and i was so happy it did when i had my baby! it made one or two hours of sleep between feedings seem fine! near the end of my pregnancy of course once i got to sleep almost NOTHING woke me up.|`|7fPuUT3Daa	Well iwake up EVERY morning between 3:30-4:30 and i have to pee.

First off congrats are in order.  That stuff just happens.  It's really an unknown.
rstJrY3jaa	There is a very good chance of her becoming pregnant.<br>  <br>  Obviously if you were using a condom, you aren't wanting a pregnancy right now, so your best bet would be to have her go to the pharmacy (if she is at least 18) and get Plan B (emergency contraception) within 72 hours, but the sooner she gets it the more effective it is at preventing pregnancy. If she is under 18, she needs to visit a Planned Parenthood clinic or her regular doctor and get a prescription for it.<br>  <br>  Also, think about reasons the condom may have broken to prevent it from happening in the future. Was it put on correctly? Did you remember to leave some room at the tip? And always make sure there is enough lubrication. Dryness easily leads to the condom breaking.|`|7w2kCTDJaa	Gee. I would say 50/50. If you JUST had sex, I'd suggest getting Plan B as soon as possible.|`|jZPv153Jaa	if yall arent ready than make her take the day aftr pill.........|`|5LyhDC8waa	ok let me help you if you had sex when she was fertile or ovulating there might be a chance?<br>  ok ask her the date of her last period from that day count 14 days and if you had sex during that day then she might be pregnant. also you are fertile 2 days before ovulation.<br>  <br>  if you need a better understanding here it is. <br>   my last period was on feb 1<br>  count 14 days and feb 15 iam ovulating so feb 12 i was fertile.|`|LQKW39SEaa	u have to wait it out and see<br>  in nine months if there is a baby then yes<br>  <br>  lol...just kidding<br>  <br>  but u really have to wait a few months before if you can find out...|`|VJ7RH9Tpaa	50/50|`|CpzlUpEnaa	Ew.<br>  Why would u tell us u just had it?<br>  We dont need to know or care to know.|`|fC9lljKaaa	depends on if you came or not. and if her ovulation was recently then its a pretty good possibility. but don't stress about it because it will usually happen if you do. go by her a test together. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ps:<br>  <br>  your ****** ***** hahahahahahahahahahahahah|`|k9fu1KEQaa	If it was 10 to 14 days after her period, chances are 50/50|`|NO4mktI8aa	Depends on where she was in her cycle|`|BQEjpIibaa	you should take a test
6783eff5fcc328b9527aa61f6d84bcf2aa	sorry for the lack of capitals, sprained wrist here.  it sounds like your daughter isn't feeling well and doesn't want to be touched.  when i have a cold my body gets sore and i get irritable.  this could be what your daughter is feeling and she just doesn't want to be touched or talked to.  she's not sure what is wrong with her but it's making her grumpy.  watch her carefully, give your nurse a call to let them know what's going on.  they will let you know whether they think it's something she needs to come in for.  let her know that she had a temperature on tuesday.  good luck, to me it doesn't sound like the terrible 2's, not something coming on so suddenly like that.|`|FplTPoAyaa	If this type of behavior is out of the ordinary, then she may not be feeling well.  Does she have a fever ? Hives ? Rash ? Perhaps she doesn't want to be touched because she doesn't feel well.  If she didn't eat her breakfast, her appetite is down.  My baby gets irritable like that when she has an ear infection.  Maybe your baby has something going on.  I would take her to the doctor to rule out any illness first.  Good luck.|`|1enIWBGnaa	When a child begins acting this way - just ignore her and walk away.<br>  Once she discovers no one is paying any attention to her - she will stop what she's doing.

3TjiJls7aa	if you don't have an STD then you can't spread one. Still be careful!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	WHAT?   WHAT?   UGH!   It's not really blood, your shedding the endometrial lining, it's totally clean - you are more likely to get an STD then anything, and if you have an STD you're just as likely to transmit it during your period as any other day in your cycle.|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	If neither you or your partner have an STD you cannot pass one to each other. The only way this could happen is if you or your partner are having sex with someone else (cheating) who may have an STD. Or if one of you is lying about having one. Be smart and safe anytime  you have sex until you are married! By then you should have enough trust in the person that they are being honest with you and you can do it whenever you want!|`|paHbLR9aaa	Yes, it is true.  You are less likely to conceive while having unprotected sex during menstruation.  However, you are more likely to catch an STD during menstruation.  It has something to do with the pH balance.  The change in the alkalinity makes it easier for bacteria to thrive.  Either way, be careful and use protection!|`|smsUZG4Iaa	why ae you worried if you dont have an STD and neither does your partner.. you can spread STDs andy time you have sex because when your having unprotected sex small cuts are created and you have the possibilty of passing on what you may or may not have,,|`|shKc7lZcaa	There is always a chance to transmit an STD at any time of the month if you are having unprotected sex....|`|VGueFw4gaa	If neither of you have any STDs, you can't give it to each other.  <br>  <br>  The acidity/alkalinity of the vagina changes during menstration, making it a more hospitable place for bacteria.  But if you aren't exposed to someone who is infected and don't have one yourself, don't worry about it.
claUGpVRaa	Not being married, you will not be allowed to put his name on the birth certificate unless he accompanies you to the registry office to register the birth. It can be added later on by joint choice of you both but won't automatically go on after a paternity test.<br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  If in doubt google your local council website and you can email the registrar|`|nKXTjqQWaa	Here in Indiana after you have given birth and are still in the hospital someone comes in to talk to the mother and father. They give you pamplets to read about putting the fathers name on the birth certificate. If the father chooses to sign that's fine. But he can also ask for a paternity test before signing.|`|AA11784984	It depends where you live. In WI the name does not go directly on the BC if your not married. He will have to take a paternity test for you to get child support and then his name will go on the birth cert.|`|0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	You do realise that child support is not offered if the mother refuses to name the father on a birth certificate.|`|bH1DYr5saa	Not completely sure - but I think the father has to be present when the birth certificate is issued, so if he's not there with you his name won't go on. If he requests a paternity test after you file for child support from him then I expect it will be court ordered.|`|dYI2r7Ylaa	If you know who the father is - of course it should be official and be put down on the birth certificate, for the child's sake if nothing else!|`|pz09LoOyaa	The name will be put on ecspecially if you are going for child support!|`|uP08b6K4aa	If you are looking to claim Child Support (UK) then paternity has to be established.

And unless he signs a paternity affidavit (admitting paternity) a paternity test will be required before ANY court will issue a child support order.  After paternity has been established, he or you can request that the birth certificate be revised to include his name.  It's not automatic, you will have to request it by contacting the Dept of Vital Statistics in your area.  They will need a copy of the paternity order or affidavit.

That happened to me with my ex, just after we broke up a skipped a whole month! I wasn't pregnant though so I assume it was stress. Take a test asap just to be sure though.|`|88bc21306118ca0ec7a15aa0586ee0dfaa	Don't worry, I doubt it that you are pregnant but just make the test so you get off the whole thing off of your mind. And your ex is a total jerk by the looks of it. <br>  <br>  =)
WIEPISyeaa	If you aren't even expecting your period til Sunday, then you DEFINITELY still have a shot at being pregnant.  Some women don't get a positive HPT til a week AFTER their missed period, and very rarely do women get positives beforehand.<br>  <br>  I would not lose hope yet....wait until Sunday and see if AF shows, and if it doesn't, then use your first morning urine on Monday morning and test again.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!  Baby dust to you!!|`|SbafPUEaaa	Go see a fertility doctor. It is unlikely that your abortion caused you any damage. It can happen, but it is highly doubtful. It is possible you are pregnant. However, even a healthy couple with no problems at all will try for a year without success. You only have a 20 percent chance of conceiving even if you have sex at your most fertile time. Also, stress does not help at all. Good luck!

1thzSbS8aa	People are not giving you the correct answer. You were molested. There is a world of difference in brain development and maturity between 10 and thirteen years of age.<br>  <br>  Did you know that it is a FELONY in most states to have sexual contact with anyone under the age of twelve? I'm not talking statutory rape, I mean a felony. That's because the physical and mental development simply isn't there to even comprehend the concept of consenting to sexual activity. Children of that age are very easily manipulated, and often keep quiet because they believe they're at fault, which is why they're the targets of predators. And you were pressured. He took advantage of you.<br>  <br>  Yes, he was also under the age of consent. That doesn't mean that he isn't guilty of sexual assault. It only means that he would have been charged as a juvenile, rather than as an adult, and if found guilty he could have spent some time in juvenile detention. I am telling you that it COULD have been a criminal matter, if you had spoken up at the time.|`|AA11210211	No it wasn't sexual abuse,both of you were willing.You knew exactly what you were doing.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	I would consider it more like curious kids that took it a bit too far. He was too young to be considered capable of sexual abuse...|`|l1STgPyRaa	well from a legal point of view yes it was as he was older most often they will allow up to 2 years differences in age anymore then that is considered abuse more often then not but then really he was of age if he know what he was doing  was wrong then  he could have been charged yet at the age you where you could not have been so from a legal point of view i would say yes.<br>  but then there is the part that you have said you wanted to know what it was like also so i would say it is a maybe but i would lean to the no side given what you have said <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|4DoXomHZaa	No. Because you were both under the legal age of consent, it falls under the catagory of mind-bending ignorance and stupidity on the part of two kids and 2 sets of parents that didn't teach them any better. It's not illegal tho it should be.|`|j9mN8Sz5aa	maybe, if you really didn't want it. i know a bunch of 13 year old guys they say they do crack and stuff, but back then it was different. you were just kids that took it too far.|`|ejelObdJaa	u werent old enoughh !! 10 yo dont kno  wat they are doin...<br>  <br>  & i think thats not consider sexual abuse because u were both under age.|`|dB6MR0wYaa	it doesnt matter how old the person is, any time someone touches you sexually without consent its sexual abuse|`|8e5YBwd7aa	No because YOU gave in
oVxr5B3Eaa	In high school, yes. Within reason. If there was TOO much action, the teachers would break it up, but I don't think that happened often. Maybe one that i went to. People were fairly tame, though I did grow up in the country. In middle school (aka, public school for me K-8), no one really even danced together. <br>  The catholic high school near us didn't allow it. You had to be 15 inches away from your partner at all times, and they had a special ruler they would use to make sure people were the appropriate distance apart. <br>  Now that I'm in college I go to clubs where I can do whatever I want and removal of clothing is encouraged (not that I've ever done that, haha, but I've seen it happen).<br>  I just keep thinking.. If I were to go back to a high school dance now, i sure would teach THEM a lesson!|`|4DoXomHZaa	No, psuedo-sex in public by minors was not tolerated. We were expected to have some pride and leave any sluttiness/imitation of empty pop stars for the backs of Escorts parked on the side of the road.<br>  <br>  Any parent who either allows/doesn't know their kids are going to raves getting naked should 1.) be sent to jail 2.) pay for the STD and pregnancies that inevitably result 3.) be sterilized<br>  <br>  Good god, don't women have any pride anymore??|`|K7H1zrCbaa	i graduated high school fiver years ago and we were not allowed to "grind" on each other.  but we also werent as slutty as girls and boys are now.  Not be able to rub all over each other didnt bother us at all.|`|HJbZHS2uaa	LOL<br>  <br>  Here we can do what ever we want<br>  <br>  This year i went to the 8th and 9th grade formal and there was hoe trains, and grinds all over(:|`|j9mN8Sz5aa	yes, even in middle school you can|`|hR1LlS2Haa	Not at all. The principals break it up|`|qbbwm7E8aa	noooooooo|`|hUdKYtegaa	no were not allowed tooo but....we do it anywayy!|`|5f705ad7991862332d2d084df541c9faaa	Yes, it's totally disgusting! People are literally on top of people.  The prinicipal and vice principals are there and they don't even do anything! It's nasty.|`|jbjoO4V7aa	We werent allowed to do it but we did anyway. The teachers basically decided to punish us by making the dances unbearably lame.|`|OefiQHiOaa	The world is getting more perverted by the hour.|`|OYLv9sJRaa	no schools allow that...sorry|`|zrO4h1hqaa	yesss. we do even in middle school|`|2LpWgU20aa	omg no! at the dances there are security guards lining the room and they litterally come in between the grinding kids, if they continue they get suspened! its crazy! once at a school dance, kids wouldnt stop grinding and the security guards were pulling the kids away from eachother, so this kid punched a security guard and they had to call the cops. it was a whole mess.lol. grinding is a big no-no at my school.|`|o0Q7LmMsaa	no we can't<br>  they break it up<br>  and i'm somewhat glad they do<br>  most people go to dances to have fun and to hangout with friends<br>  i just don't think that grinding at a school dance is appropriate!|`|JduQHocdaa	Not allowed,but all the administrators are out numbered by the students so they can't do anything about it.|`|Q9GFKzg3aa	we do at our middle school dances...until the teachers turn all the lights on.|`|1gVDZrPuaa	No, but we have too many people so they don't catch us.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	yes that is what happens at dances.

'Is she a good baby?'  um, like there are 'bad' babies pfftt    At the graveside of my deceased baby a woman said   "oh, you can have another child dear"   I turned to her standing next to her husband's grave and said " oh, right, and you can get another husband dear"  she didn't seemed insulted but still didn't realize what a dumb thing she said.|`|A5MXPeO4aa	going back 30y ago when i had my son i felt so intimidated by the midwife who asked me if i had fed my 6 hour old baby, my reply was "i have given him some breast milk" she replied "milk milk u do not give new born babies milk" she made me feel really stupid and i was quite upset by it at the time.|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	While that can happen LOL my son had a reaction to my milk it is rare.. what an idiot.. I had my friends daughter tell me 14yrs old mind ya.. she said she dont want to have kids cause you can die and the baby can die and you both can still die after delievery.. I wanted to knock her out I was about to pop with my first child scared enough and she is bringing up stuff you dont want to hear.|`|hGNvbC6oaa	"Ooh you're 9 weeks pregnant?  That's wonderful.

I wanted to say "no b*tch I'm going out of my way to lie to you"  I finally just started saying (especially to the fat people knocking on me cause I was big)  No, I"m not having twins, are you??  And they'd get offended forgetting that they insulted me first.    I mentioned to also to a girl, that I was going to breastfeed and she said to me "Awww your poor boobs"|`|2dxlnfJYaa	Wow I needed a laugh today! Some of these are pretty funny. In my own situation the stupid comments people have made usually have something to do with me breastfeeding. Like for instance one of my friends said how old is your baby now, I said 5 months and I said I was planning on breastfeeding for a year and she said "YOU'RE STILL BREASTFEEDING"? Like I'm breastfeeding an 8 year old or something. Ahhh people.|`|63bxt86taa	on the day i told my 'friend' i was pregnant she told me, "dont worry if you have a miscarrage you can always try again...."- b*tch!|`|d587552c069a9566f3cb4046a79c1035aa	I have identical twin girls and people always say "Oh are they boys?"

The kicker is that she has three kids!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	When I told my friend I was breastfeeding, she said (her words exactly) "ew that's gross, why do you want a baby hanging off your t*t?". I was quite offended.     People ask me; "is she a good baby?".... no, she's a 2 and a half week old with an ASBO.     Her gender was a secret when I was pregnant, and people used to ask me what I was having, and i'd reply that it was a secret. So then they'd ask, "what name have you picked out?".... yeah cos i'm guna tell you that....|`|KWHiJbhaaa	I had a nurse comment to me two days after my son was born that I should only feed my son 1.75oz or I will "explode" his stomach....  just dumb.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	oh what a handsome boy when she was in a pink carrier and girl clothes|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I got so sick and tired of, "You haven't had that baby yet???" OBVIOUSLY I hadn't because I was still extremely pregnant.    I finally started telling people, "Oh yeah... had him last night. I just left him at home" That just drove me crazy!        This isn't stupid but it is really funny. When I was pregnant with my first my niece who at the time was 7 walked up to me, pinched my boob and said, "Do you have milk in them things yet?" I about died laughing!|`|AykczQleaa	When I was in labor and having a contraction, a nurse told me to " Get a grip"   This was after the other nurse was trying to place the catheter in my cl*t, and not in my urethra!

It's nobody's business...drives me nuts!|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I had someone ask me if my kids are mine because they look nothing like me. They actually said I should get a maternity test to be sure.

So most people did not know about our baby until I was over 23 weeks pregant because my fiancee would not tell anyone after what his mother said. I was excited and wanted everyone to know.    Also she started to go in to the number one causes of babies dying in the womb and mothers dying during pregnancy or birth!!! As if I wanted to hear anything about my baby dying or me dying????    I am 31 weeks pregant and my baby and I are healthy, happy and fine and have been this whole pregnancy...

DS is almost 22 months and hasn't bitten a chunk out of either of them yet. my son had a stomach virus at 9 months and my fiance's aunt told me i shouldn't nurse him because it would make him sicker though his doctor said the opposite        i ddon't give my son juice once because he doesn't need it and another because it gave him diaper rash- that said oh that's too bad because he needs it, it's good for him. like water isn't.   OH and this one made me mad- me a one of the doctors (vet ) at my old job had our babies about a month apart- my son was a month early. anyway her son was almost 8 pounds at birth and lost no weight. my son was 6.6 at went down to 5.13 well we went to a picnic when my son was almost 2 weeks and my boss said doesn't he eat? why is he so little? umm he's a newborn der der der     also when i first got pregnant i was telling people at work and one girl goes " oh i'm sorry" i was like what? i know i'm young but you don't have to be rude|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	when I was pregnant with my first son my husband showed his mother a ultrasound of the baby I think I was about 22 weeks pregnant and she said her words exactly "he doesnt look like you he has a round forehead and you have a flat forehead" i wanted to punch and say are you a morone the baby is still developing and when I gave birth my son looked exactly like his father. someone also asked me if my pants were to tight cause if they were i was squishing the babies head. another time i went to an indoor pool and a lady sitting there said to me your going to drowned your baby submerged in all that water , I just laughed and walked a way.
VC7PyH53aa	It's painful and they don't know how to react to the pain.<br>  Once the tooth comes in she will settle down. <br>  <br>  You might want to try a cold teething ring, they help sometimes or<br>  at least distract them from the pain.|`|hVVALFAPaa	I don't think her behavior is caused by teething. I think it is caused by being 9 months old.<br>  <br>  Babies at this age are starting to 'discover themselves' and are learing all kinds of new things--crawling, standing, walking, feeding themselves, new foods, words, etc. She can get frustrated trying to learn and do all of these things and may take her frustrations out on toys, crying, not sleeping, tantrums, etc.<br>  <br>  That is a lot to take in all at once. Her personality may go through changes as she learns all of these new things. This may be her 'new' personality' or she might calm down once she has mastered a few of the new skills. <br>  <br>  It is cute, but now is when you need to start being firm with her. Decide what behavior is OK and what is not. When she does something that isn't on your list of OK behaviors, pick her up and move her away from the area, speaking firmly to her about how that was not nice. No spanking or time out is necessary, just getting her away from the situation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

You do not have actual milk yet, you have colostrum, and the baby needs that all to his or her self.<br>  <br>  Umm assuming you are still pregnant, that is. You might have even already known that. He probably won't like it, and you wont have to worry about it any more lol.|`|WPI0Z47saa	If he just wants to taste it then he is just curious like most are and there is nothing wrong with that.

Might be something funny to watch. <br>  But its all up to you =] G&B|`|CpiLHcTlaa	i have a lot of friends who either have them selfs or know guys who had. personally i think its a little weird.. but to each his own.|`|901f6618ea3fa1d1b7c9ed4a27d40a3daa	I don't believe thee is a man who hasn't wanted to know what it taste like..  let him have a taste, then laugh hysterically when he makes a funny face...  And reply,,,  "Want Some More"...|`|pdQUfINraa	hahahaha...a mother can never run out of breast milk, in her cycle..so daddy can drink anytime..haha|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Just to taste it or to drink glasses of it? Sure let him taste it and actually if anyone in the family is coming down with a cold have them drink a few ounces, it's very beneficial. Other than that, it's for the baby!|`|VHHis05Naa	My husband insisted my whole first pregnancy that he wanted to try it, but when it came down to it, he was too freaked out.  He never did.|`|pkdDEJd4aa	I would just let him, it won't take away from the baby, you will produce more, he's curious and probably wants to feel close to you, actually. Think of it this way.. your breasts are both a maternal tool AND a sexual tool.. when your husband plays with them it's not about being maternal, and when your baby drinks from the it isn't sexual, right?<br>  <br>  Same with our mouths, we use them to speak but also to do sexual acts.<br>  It's up to you but really I don't think it's a big deal.|`|uuHPneEcaa	hey if he wants to drink it pump it out and let him have a sip.. lol.. he might like it he might not.<br>  <br>  He probaby won't like it. i think some men say hey those are my breast and they don't want the baby to have them all to them selves. my baby's father told me I couldn't breast feed because THEY WHERE HIS!!|`|4e67Pdfvaa	its not a big deal, it doesn't take away from the baby either.. he's just curious. :)|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Mine wanted to, so you know what?  I let him try a little... that cured him real quick, he has no interest in it anymore!
3WWHWsHOaa	I'm a bit weird. I threaten to let him divorce me. That way he can trade me in for a newer model.<br>  <br>  It has been an ongoing joke since we wrote our vows.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	A better question is what don't i do. I am a SAHM so I spend my days caring for my children and doing all sorts of things for my husband. I of course tell him daily that I love him but in the meantime he has clean underwear and socks, breakfast, lunch and dinner, a clean house to come home too, often times a clean truck inside and out as well. I take care of his dog while he is gone, not to mention his children. I do all the finances so that he doesn't have to stress over them. Basically I do anything I can so that he doesn't have to. I know that being a stay at home mom means that I am here to do these things always but to be honest it wasn't the reason I became one so the fact that I take time away from my children during the day to do these things so that he can come home and we can all go do something really shows how much I love him.|`|cteyFJxhaa	He brought me flowers once and I said....awwww, Boo Boo, you totally don't suck today!.....Kind of an ongoing joke between us is that we're perfect and everybody else sucks.....sounds dumb but that's one of the great things we have together is this almost "secret language" when we take the time to speak in stupid inside joke riddles we know we're connected.  <br>  <br>  We can carry on a whole conversation in a crowded room and everyone else would think we're going to kill each other and then we burst out laughing like fools and they all think we're crazy.<br>  <br>  It's kind of cool.<br>  <br>  When my hubbies home sick I call and the conversation goes like this:<br>  <br>  Hey, you dead yet?<br>  <br>  Not yet, WTF do you care for?<br>  <br>  Don't wanna clean up.  Need me to stop at the dealer (drug store) on the way home? <br>  <br>  No gotta couple hits (cold pills) left....<br>  <br>  K, go to sleep you talk too much....then I hang up.<br>  <br>  <br>  How whacked is that?|`|YBQvzEhGaa	I send him text messages that say "I loved you today". We have always said that to each other.  I also sneak and make his coffee in the mornings and start his car before he leaves for work so it will be warm.  He likes to fill up my gas tank in my car and surprise me like that.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I rub his back at night, it helps him fall asleep. I pack his lunch for him, tell him that I appreciate all he does, and other things that you just don't say! lol|`|AA12145826	I generally call it out to him as I'm running out the door. Oh and I'm letting him get a new bass boat. If that doesn't say "I Love You", I don't know what does!|`|um29wkUPaa	Put out.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Wash his underware. I mean really----who else would? (-:|`|PGiOSIBkaa	Idk .. I jus .. Show him ;)|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I get up at 6am every day instead of staying warm and cuddly with my baby to make breakfast and lunch for my husband. If that ain't love, hunny nothing is.|`|j2mRop0laa	I try to get a *thinking of you* card every so often and sneak it in his briefcase when he is spending time away from home. <br>  A few times a month I make a little day package for him, when he's going to be out all day (a pack of gum, a bag of peanuts, some flavor packets for water etc) and sneak them on his seat before he goes out to the car. <br>  We are normally always together because he mostly works at home. He got a call yesterday from his company telling him they are flying him out of state in a few week for 5 days. I'll be lost...<br>  He does sweet things for me throughout the day. My favorite thing is that whenever I go to bed, he comes in 5 minutes later to "tuck me in" because he stays up half the night. lol|`|A7SJT50Kaa	that is so sweet! <br>  <br>  when i was sick, hubby waited on me hand and foot, doted on my every whim on top of taking care of the girls. <br>  <br>  on a daily basis, hubby tries to make me feel sexxxy (doesn't always work)<br>  <br>  and this past Valentine's Day, he left little notes around and sent me on a scavenger hunt to find a little gift<br>  <br>  i like to leave notes here and there (shower mirror, cell phone, computer)<br>  <br>  and i like to make little unexpected treats<br>  <br>  Nic: that's true love, babby!|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	Lately I've been sending him text messages calling him my sexy little babymaker (since we've decided to have another) and tell him I love him. <br>  I also pack his lunch & make him coffee in the morning additional to getting myself & 2 children ready. <br>  <br>  I also scratch his back when it's itchy, massage his back when he's sore, I also help him when he kicks into *cleaning-mode* or *fix-it mode* at 11:00 pm at night. <br>  <br>  And of course there's always the bedroom....|`|4e67Pdfvaa	I don't think i should write what I do for my husband if you know what I mean ;)|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Send him sexy emails at work....then act on them later;-)<br>  <br>  (or wait....maybe that's how I take care of me)

fMilDRgLaa	My boys would not take a sippy cup until I found the NUK sippy cup.  It is around $2.00 for each one at walmart or target.  The key was to have a "soft" like sippy top....not the hard sippy tops.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	They have the "nuby" 3 in 1 at wal mart.<br>  <br>  It has a bottle nipple<br>  <br>  sippy spout<br>  <br>  and then straw.<br>  <br>  The spout attachment is the only one my daughter would drink out of.  We had a horrible time transitioning her for a while.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	A nipple is a nipple.  A bottle with handles is just a bottle.<br>  <br>  There's no benefit to sippy cups, some studies show they are worse for speech problems than bottles.  Sippy cups are sometimes useful for teaching a baby to drink from a cup, however the leak proof ones (except the straw ones) teach babies to tip cups to a point that won't work with open cups.  Of course the leak proof ones are very convenient.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I used the Nuby brand with the silicone spouts for both my kids and highly recommend them they feel enough like a bottle and my daughter transitioned to a regular sippy cup pretty easy after that. DOn't expect her to love them right away, a lot of babies just play with sippy cups just keep giving her it to get her used to it, it also might help to have a child similar to her age use a sippy cup in front of her (we did that for my cousins baby and she just picked hers up and drank out of it)! Good luck!|`|955YoHvVaa	The ones with the nipple tops are just like bottles..if you are going with this choice don't get the nuby sport one..it is a bottle and it didn't help my daughter get used to it at all..I have used the other nuby ones with great success..really all you have to do is try different ones til you find one that your child will take..|`|jNHbw3PMaa	my step-mother-in-law has the avento or watever they are called she said they are expensive for a cup but it was well worth it she has cleaned and re used it for all 3 of her kids but i have also heard the gerber graduate cups work well|`|tAFPbAUaaa	The kind that I've used to get my babies used to sippy cups is the Nuby brand. The top is soft and they're less than $2 at Wal-Mart.|`|7ee2e58a43d3c7214fd3e8cb1f2c131eaa	I tried several before trying the Nuby kind at walmart.They have a soft nipple and it doesn't hurt his gums.My son loved them & they are cheap too.I think they are under $2.|`|lcuxD3qlaa	You could probably find some of them at your local shopping center. Also just go to baby's r us...I'm sure they have it
AA10475412	When I was 15.which was 25 years ago I made obscene phone calls to businesses, and recording them on the tape recorder, I also called residences, and what I did was blow heavy into the phone, played with the buttons, burped, remained silent into the phone and other nasty things, but I never spoke. My mother found the tape by accident when she came home from a meeting, because when I left the house, I left the tape player running, and she pushed the wrong buttons, and found out the phone calls, and when I came home she was irate, and was screaming at me.  A day later I had 2 complaints from the prank phone calls from ladies from the obscene phone calls, and she grounded me for a week in a half, and I was grounded me from using the phone for a whole month.<br>  <br>  I don't think your punishment is harsh, I feel you deserve this punishment.|`|IGcS9K62aa	Welcome to your teenage years. You'll thank them for it when you have kids.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	when I was 12 I stole some things from k mart.. I got 2 months grounded. <br>  How old are you> 4 months is reasonable based on your age,.|`|PGiOSIBkaa	My mom tried grounding me for a week or two but forgot about it.  BUT after I got my tattoo, I was in trouble for a few days because I was 17 .. But that punishment went away quickly.  I didn't have a phone during that time .. Plus no computer.|`|LU96bnCdaa	gosh ur parents r 2 strict....<br>  i would never do that 2 my kids!|`|w0eRRsoVaa	I'd say it's kinda harsh but at the same time, I also don't know what all the offenses are against you in the past year.  If you've got a smart mouth, bad attitude, failing studies, etc. I can see where your parents are coming from.  However, try to see if you can be helpful around the house, offer to help with chores, etc.  They may reduce the charges if you start being helpful around the house.<br>  <br>  I was grounded for 3 weeks about 10 years ago lol, which wound up being about a week because I lied to my mom about where I was going to be, who I was going to be with, and all that.  It was only made worse by a friend of mine doing the same thing so that neither of our parents knew where we were and yeah, needless to say.  It could have been worse but because I felt so terrible about it, mom laid off.  I wasn't allowed out with friends for a few weeks but, I lived.  What's worse is had I been truthful, it wouldn't have even been a big deal.|`|MWVipC01aa	I got grounded for 3 weeks during Winter Vacation.<br>  I left one of my conversations up on Windows Live && my Mom read it.<br>  She was like horrified,<br>  and she gave me back my computer Christmas Eve ):<br>  I'm grounded AGAIN<br>  Right now,<br>  For bad grades. sucks being grounded
72SrLDQ3aa	Most women who fail the 1 hour, pass the 3 hour.<br>  The 3 hour test really sucks. You get poked 4 times and you can't do anything. No eating, no drinking other than water, but I don't remember if even that was okay. No chewing gum, no sleeping. Just sit there for 3 hours.|`|HW89eJEZaa	when you went for your 1 hour was it a fasting or did you just go in and have your blood tested? if you just had your blood tested, you will prob fail because for the 3 hr test you have to drink a glucose based syrupy drink that measures how well your body breaks down the sugar you ingest. and that is not a bad thing, you will just have to watch what you eat and test your blood too see if your glucose is where it is supposed to be. you can  keep it controlled with diet, i did, and mine was off the charts!|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I failed the one hour test, my points were in the 170s. The day before I went to take my 3 hour test, I avoided white starches, sugars, and carbs. I ate baked chicken and salad, and drank a bunch of water. Of course I don't know if me doing all that helped or what, but I ended up barely passing the 3 hour test. I have heard that women that usually fail the one hr test, will pass the second test, unless the points were like in the 180-190 range to begin with. Don't stress over it, and if you do fail, the diet isn't so bad. My cousin ended up being put on the diabetic diet, and it actually helped her out with heartburn. The baby had to be delivered a little early, at like 37 weeks..|`|pMaoOhULaa	the first one i took i failed and i had to do the 3 hr and before this one they said no eating or drinking after midnight and I said was I not suppose to eat or drink after midnight with the one h ad they said yes and I had eaten after midnight with the one hr because I was not told otherwise till the 3 hr so I passed the 3 hr the drink was nastier and they took blood 4 times but I passed and thats all that counts! Hope this helps!!! =) and congrats on your baby!|`|nfLyS1toaa	i failed my one hour yesterday. my blood sugar was 144 and she told me it needed to be 134 or below. i have to take my 3 hour in 2 weeks and if i fail that then i will have diabetes. but only while i'm pregnant. just see what happens after your 3 hour test and go from there. also make sure you call them and ask them what you need to do to prepare for the test. the nurse told me that i cant eat after midnight. good luck|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Most women fail their first test but go on to pass the 3 hour test. However, I was one of the unlucky ones :( Chances are you'll pass just be prepared that you may fail it. Good luck!
pOhrdjgYaa	For the most part, my natural labor felt like menstrual cramps- and not nearly as bad as the monthly ones, where I felt like I was going to pass out, getting light-headed. It wasn't even that bad, so when labor started, it was definitely doable! A few things to know: fear and tension create extra, unnecessary pain, so educate yourself and practice relaxing. That'll kill off a lot of the pain on its own. Work with your body, instead of fighting it with tension and anxiety. For another thing, those docs aren't eager to share the fact that epidurals carry their own risks! I've heard of epidurals that wore off late in labor (when pain is more intense, and mother is unprepared for it because she hasn't felt it up until that late point); for one of my friends, her epidural worked on only half of her body, and the other half felt everything! There are other, more serious risks, which I'd probably get sued for mentioning, but look it up- they're there. Most epidurals contain NARCOTICS, for crying out loud. No thanks! I'll take a few hours of sporadic cramps to avoid all that mess. It was NOT the worst pain of my life, not worth complicating things with drugs. I'm obviously not every woman, but if you're concerned, learn all you can, and not from movies and stereotypes, which over-dramatize everything. Read, read, read, and talk to various professionals- not just one, who may be biased in one direction or another.|`|hWN7L8l3aa	to be completely honest. I think almosttt everyone here can say that it's not the absolute worst pain in the world. I definitely feel that way now. I can't even remember it hurting at all. but I remember being in labor, and thinking at that time, that it was the worst pain I've felt in my life.. and begging for an epidural. it hurts. but you forget about it. and you do it again. and you remember through labor, why you believed it hurt so bad the first time. and forget it again. it's a vicious cycle. buttt.. there is so much pain management.. some women barely feel a single contraction.|`|90zcKChJaa	It all depends on how you want to take the contractions. So many women go into labor only expecting the worst pain ever, and they get it. Try to stay positive... Yeah, it's uncomfortable, but it's really not as bad as some women make it out to be. It all goes away soon after...|`|oZEPi0nuaa	I have low pain tolerance. I did not get an epidural, and I made it through o.k.! If you are unable to manage with the pain, the nurses will help you through it. Yes it hurts, but our bodies can handle it. Don't worry!|`|8mchLCQhaa	It depends on how hard the labor is and each persons own perception of pain. I was induced with a 14 hour labor and it was awful. But my sister had hers without meds and said it wasn't that painful.|`|Ks7lENScaa	It is bad. Sorry.  I don't care how tough a woman claims she is.  It doesn't apply when in labor.  Now if you get pain meds that is another story.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	does feeling like a dump truck is running over your middle section and crushing you sound painful, you decide.|`|gPYTkIW2aa	yeah it changes from person to person. <br>  but seriously...GET AN EPIDURAL!!!<br>  :)|`|3ZiHhc3Faa	It does depend on the individual.  It also depends on your mindset.  I think it is ridiculous for women to suggest getting an epidural without considering all the facts.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	It depends on the woman's pain tolerance. I am not one to handle pain very well, so my contractions were very painful and opted for an epidural to help ease the pain for a little while.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, and yes.<br>  <br>  Labor hurts.  Some women have more pain than others, and some women have greater pain tolerance than others.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	they are usually worse than anyone can explain.  i know of no one that said their labor pains didn't hurt.  i generally have a pretty high pain tolerance & they are like nothing i have ever experienced.  you can't move, think, breathe, or walk.  it's bad don't let anyone tell you any different unless they are under an epidural.  :)|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I think it depends on the person, how they handle pain and the size of the baby. My sister has had 7 kids and 3 of them (her boys) all weight over 11 lbs and she had them all natural and never screamed once. Other women have a 6 lbs kid and you would think the world is coming to an end. I can't speak from personal experience yet, but I'm hoping I am similar to my sister!|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	I think it depends on how much pain the woman can tolerate.  Many woman have a high tolerance for pain while others do not.  Plus it is a matter of mind over matter and once you lose that the pain will seem worse than what it really is.|`|oojO4WAraa	It depends on the woman.  I didn't think they were that bad.  I had my baby with no pain killers.  But, he was fast - only about 30 minutes of labor.

wHOQXToHaa	My son is just 2 now & he is the same way. Computer cords, buttons, gadgets, screwdrivers, house keys, resetting our dishwasher, you name it he does it- if it's not toy related! I know it certainly makes it harder when you go somewhere and you just want them to play with toys but they want to do everything else! I find it hard at the playground sometime because he doesnt want to play on the playsets, he wants to find everything else to do-LOL. It's totally a boy thing. Weird, but they are smart & like figuring things out. I encourage it in a safe environment- they learn quick! :)|`|KNxs4PrZaa	my 2 year old daughter couldnt care less about toys. she wants to play with just about anything she is not supposed too. tools, DVD player, my makeup, batteries and cords as well, etc.  if he seems like he is not developing well in other areas such as communication adn speech talk to your doctor about it, but other than that  i wouldnt be concerned if i were you sounds normal to me.|`|AA10063059	my grandson was exactly the same at this age ,he would tie everything together and tape everything up,he is 6 now and still prefers tape measures and hammers|`|CNZn1qhJaa	2.5?|`|pqzKlNudaa	Ok, I had this problem with my son too, first it was Thomas the choo choo train, then Mc Queen, and know the trash trucks. He has five trash trucks like the real ones that pick up the trash bins, he also got the trash bins like the real ones, But every certain time they get a new obsession, hell get out of his obsession after a while or when he finds a new thing to be obsessed with. But this is the way kids are just let him play but not with things that can harm him, Just have fun while he is obsessed with his little constructing thing.|`|1enIWBGnaa	The behavior is NOT annoying - it means he will be an engineer when he becomes an adult - which is a GREAT sign!<br>  Get him toys he can build things with, some places even have 'child sized' tools which come with a tool belt.  Once his motor skills get him to the point of actually using tools properly (school age) then give him pieces of wood and let him create!|`|Xxz9ihH2aa	no he dont have to be interested in things like toys but dont let him grow up too fast.|`|AldxcKwnaa	Get him tested for the PDD spectrum|`|F2JEvYX7aa	That is great, you should encourage him.

1S7uXsInaa	Warm steamy showers, vaporizer and baby Vicks.|`|hVVALFAPaa	No medicine will really help.<br>  <br>  You can try warm steamy showers to help clear her nose, then suction the stuff out. A vaporizer or mister in her room could help her sleep. Vics Vapo-rub might soothe a cough and clear her nose. Sleeping more upright can help her breathe easier too -- like in her car seat or prop up the legs on her bed.<br>  <br>  Give her extra liquids, especially juice. Try to keep her on a normal schedule and let her eat her normal foods, though you may want to cut back on dairy (it makes the mucus thicker and harder to clear out) though of course she will still take her formula or breast milk.<br>  <br>  If she starts running a fever, some tylenol can help.<br>  <br>  If anything changes color-- mucus becomes greenish, ears are red, eyes get crusty, etc, she may have a secondary infection so a doctor can decide if she needs an antibiotic, but the antibiotic will not help with the cold itself. (Colds are caused by viruses which do not respond to antibiotics)|`|bebe9c739d0b1ba65bd5c996c40ee2eaaa	My son got sick this week, and it started Sunday with runny nose, I mean it was running like every two seconds. I used a lot of kleenex and wipes and was suctioning him a lot . His poor nostrils!<br>  <br>  We went to the doc they said he had ear infection, gave some amoxicillin.<br>  <br>  Well a day later, he woke up and temp was 105. We took him to Childrens Mercy and the doc there said he had  viral illness, and we would have to let it run its course. She said he didn't have an ear infection. They suctioned him out to test for RSV or the FLu, results came back negative ( thank God). <br>  <br>  So needless to say, we wasted money getting prescription. Hes better now. I had to give him Motrin a few times for the past few days.<br>  <br>  NOW... hes coughing more, it started last night. The doc told me that he would start feeling better by now, but stated a cough may start, and the cough can last for a few weeks. <br>  <br>  NOW, this morning he broke out in hives, and I read where a baby can do that if they've had a viral infection... GREAT... :)|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	My son gets sinus infections quite frequently, he doesn't sneeze a lot but he coughs and has a runny nose, I use saline mist in his nose and then use a bulb syringe to get out the snot and I run a humidifier in his room, If it is a sinus infection his snot is green and he has to be on antibiotics.|`|a9btWYKRaa	My 9 month old daughter has been ill quite abit over winter, we found that if we rubbed Vick's (6month +) on her chest and back then sat in the bathroom with her, all windows and doors closed and a hot shower running, it really cleared her nose, chest and throat. We done this every night before bed and it really helped her to sleep better.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ySTDkd5iaa	I put baby rub on my daughters chest at night, because she always chokes on her mucous when shes asleep..steamy baths with Johnsons VAPOR BATH works wonders for her.<br>  <br>  <br>  My mom used to give us Dymattap (not sure on spelling) when we were young & I have tried this on my baby. Its a cough & cold over the counter medicine...but you need to buy the one that says TODDLERS. I only gave my baby 2 drops every 4-5 hours. It helps
WIEPISyeaa	November 8 is my birthday. :)<br>  <br>  Anyway, my husband and I had similar intentions (we went off of birth control the month we got married.)  But that was 6 months ago, and so far no luck.  I have insulin resistance and PCOS, so my doctor already started me on fertility treatments.  I take Metformin (which helps to regulate your cycles) and I started taking Clomid this month (which helps you ovulate.)<br>  <br>  Do you have regular cycles?  If so, then you probably just haven't gotten lucky yet.  If not, then you should talk to your doctor about why you aren't having regular cycles.  The most heartbreaking situation are those people who have been "trying" for a year, and then they find out they were never even ovulating!!!!!  That's so depressing....<br>  <br>  Anyway, I would suggest giving it another month or two and then speaking with your doctor about checking things over (making sure your fallopian tubes look clear, making sure you don't have any cysts, and possibly even checking your husband's sperm count.)<br>  <br>  Just remember, this is your life, and your future, and your future baby, so don't let doctors push you around.  If you are forward enough, they will do what you want them to (ie prescribe you clomid even though it's only been 5 months, not a year, haha.)<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust to us both!!!!!|`|JOmecV0jaa	I am real glad that you are going to the doctor, i wish you can go sooner or to a fertility specialist to see what is going on with your body as soon as possible. That way if there is a problem with you or your husband then you can start treatment for it. I have been married 4 years and didnt go to the doctor until 2 years ago and turns out i have pcos in which i can not ovulate on my own and irregular periods. But now i am taking treatment for it. SO hopefully i can get pregnant soon. But good luck to you. And if i were you i wouldnt wait for a year go as soon as possible the more you wait the less your chances are to get pregnant. Good Luck and God Bless!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Trying to conceive was the hardest thing for me. It was just awful. My husband and I tried for 2 1/2 years before we finally became pregnant in July and are now expecting a lil girl next month. Really I don't think there is anything that would've helped me cope. I was completely depressed the whole time and sex was not even fun for me anymore. All I thought about was if I was going to get pregnant this time. If your doctor won't check your fertility until November then you may want to try buying the clearblue easy fertility monitor. My husband and I bought that and only used it one cycle. (also was on clomid for one cycle). I know a lot of women that have tried the monitor and it worked for them. I know that this is really hard and the longer it takes the harder it gets. Just don't listen to people when they tell you it will happen when it's suppose to happen. That just makes you feel worse. Try to remain positive even though it's really hard. Good luck to you and baby dust!|`|eytlIKITaa	I know it's frustrating!  My husband and I have been TTC for 10 cycles now!  I'm at the two week wait now, and I'm trying not to get my hopes up...  The best thing I can tell you is to know your cycle- Mine being really irregular it's been hard, and somewhat confusing!  I only wish that I knew when I was younger that it's normal to have a 28-47 day cycle!  That would have been nice for someone to tell me that I wasn't constantly "late"!  Just relax (although that's probably the hardest thing in the world to do!) and have fun trying!  : )<br>  <br>  Good luck!  And LOTS of baby dust to us!!!|`|smsUZG4Iaa	try going to www.fertilityfriend.com.. that site is awesome.. i wish you the best of luck.. keep me informed
1G3XPiq3aa	I generally wouldn't call anyone a slut. I think it's a pretty disgusting double standard our society has that is never applied to males, and you shouldn't let anyone make you feel like you are.<br>  <br>  They were people you knew, and you were responsible for how much you drank, so I wouldn't start throwing accusations around about being "scheemed on", unless you were making it really clear it was something you didn't want to happen. It makes people take rape cases less seriously. Just be careful of how much you drink next time and make sure you're around people who will watch out for you.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Yes you behaved like a slut.<br>  <br>  YOU got tanked and put yourself into a very dangerous position, and you know it. Not to mention the illegality of this and how it could ruin your life forever.<br>  <br>  "I don't remember much"....so you allowed yourself to be not in control of yourself. What a frickin disaster you could have had.<br>  <br>  "Schemed"..............hahahahah!!!    No honey, this is YOUR fault. You put yourself into that position. You allowed it to happen.<br>  <br>  STOP GETTING DRUNK AND LETTING STRANGERS PUT THEIR HANDS ON YOUR VAGINA. That's disgusting. And slutty. Get some pride.|`|sz5J9V6aaa	You shouldn't have gotten drunk, sorry, but thats what happens.|`|If2ww2i9aa	scheemed.<br>  guys are weird.lol.<br>  it could happen to anyone, so i dont judge you for having fun.|`|ZN5bBNevaa	you were drunk and they took advantage of you. they shoul of known that they had to respect you and your friend and if that was a fantacy they had i mean they got what they got|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	Everyone makes mistakes every now and then, but if you make "mistakes" all the time, thats another story. Besides, its not like you slept with him.|`|hq0SecvTaa	Your telling me you sucked his dick, that's pretty hoeish activity to me or drunk chick activity.|`|j9mN8Sz5aa	no, don't worry, you were intoxicated|`|TWiOp0xLaa	3rd? Ehh.<br>  <br>  <br>  Americans have such strange names for things :p|`|BiHbT9pTaa	Eh, your not really a slut, but that was a stupid decision. Dont worry about it tho..|`|smsUZG4Iaa	uh is this a real question.. lol|`|ejelObdJaa	nahh but dat was a lil dumb haha.!<br>  <br>  btw how old r u ? <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|9NfLuHo9aa	Some of these people are dumb...one its not a stranger someone you knew, if its a guy you were talking to then you prob gonna go full with him anyways. You didnt say he went third base, you said we so its mutual is what that implies so the guy hand was on her or w.e but she reciprocated also so its both at fault. Idk if it was a stranger maybe it would be rape but a guy you like and no then nope. Does it mean u a slut, like i said guy u know. Would u rather it was someone else doing that or even more? No i don't think so, you're not bad just had guys being guys. Though some guys might have took u home and let u sleep i guess signs got crossed or u got schemed..either way better than being a stranger|`|P9S5wlLyaa	No, if you were drunk, they took advantage of you. I think you're dumb, and should have known better, though.|`|Nt1Tz3zuaa	noo honey your not a slut but just dont let it keep happening, you dont want all your firsts to be something you dont rememberr :) love ya pooks!|`|OYLv9sJRaa	Next time you drink you should stay away from boys|`|K4Ncf5Pyaa	woww<br>  you definitely got schemed on<br>  and this guy was just someone you talk to?<br>  not even a boyfriend?<br>  wow you whoreee|`|r39EDGhPaa	I think you're dumb for getting so drunk that you "couldnt" control yourself.  Although, I refuse to believe that's an excuse.  I've been really drunk before and have never hooked up with anyone, no matter how many guys are there- even if it's my boyfriend.<br>  <br>  You're not a sl*t though.|`|A3zAXntxaa	They did take advantage of you, but you weren't scheemed on, you were drunk, but you sort of knew what was happening, so it's part your fault too. You're definitely not a $lut though.<br>  <br>  A $lut being someone who sleeps with numerous guys.
6xf1GfbUaa	No. Don't just let him pick the name unless you actually "like" the name he's choosing. You guys will have to come to some kind of understanding.|`|VHHis05Naa	I'm so glad my husband isn't one of those guys who insist on having a junior.  I don't think you are forced into anything.  I think any parent is entitled to veto a name if they don't like it.  Also, the junior thing gets confusing in the future when bills start coming in under the kid's name.|`|hOWNwpCLaa	There has to be at least one other name that you agree on.  Try 20000-names.com, they have a ton of names from all over the world that you can look through.  <br>  <br>  I would never suggest letting one partner be in charge of naming your baby.  My brother-in-law named their second child, and his wife hated the name so much, that she's considering legally changing the girl's name, and she's never called her by her real name, only the name she wanted her to have.  Not to say that you or your husband are anything like that, but it'd be terrible for your boy to be stuck with a name that you don't really care for.  So, I think it's best to work it out, before your baby's born.|`|34VXCyvVaa	Obviously the girl's name was more important to you or you wouldn't have made the deal with him.  Since the boy's name is very important to him, I think you have to honor the deal you made.  However, boys who are named after their fathers often use a nickname their entire lives and you can certainly have a hand in choosing that.|`|0BC2WTyoaa	That is why you don't make deals.  ;)<br>  Unless you HATE it I would say a deal is a deal and next time you get to decide.|`|OHfZFR31aa	You should have thought about that before you made a deal.|`|0aEYjVzMaa	talk to him about it again.  your baby will someday be a man, and does he really want to have the name jr. all his life?  even when he's an old man?|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	You need to either stick to the deal and let him name him what he wants or he gets to help you with a girls name. I did the dad pick boy name I pick girl name with my daughter (we didn't know what we were having) and I was SOOOOOO glad when she was a girl, he wanted to name her Patrick Micheal. I let my husband pick our sons name and I'm not a big fan (Jaxon David- I wanted Owen:() I'd tell him that he could name the baby after himself by giving him a middle name the same but it's not fair to make your child be "jr" Ususally guys change their minds a couple hundred times anyway, good luck and congrats|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	No.  The child is a product of both of you.  I don't care about "making a deal" when it comes to the name of your child there are no binding deals IMHO.  Just think about the fact that whatever name is chosen you will both be saying pretty much everyday for the rest of your life. You should BOTH love the name.  And I think that is the case with the girl name too!  Work together just like you did to create him!|`|2a726b94b1136e6caf4d74c8981c9e24aa	You did make the deal with him.  Perhaps your son could have his first name and a different middle name?  That way he would be named after your husband, but not be a "jr."  He could even have the same initials, and you could call your son by his middle name if you wanted to.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	You made a deal, you should stick to it. Next time you will know not to do this. Just tell him if he wants to name this one no matter what you get to name the next one, boy or girl. Good luck.|`|0Of1i0Ruaa	You should definitely be prepared to compromise, but be prepared to compromise on a girl's name later, if necessary.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	you made the deal and now you'll suffer for it.|`|JqPbyEmIaa	tell him how yu feel about it
6783eff5fcc328b9527aa61f6d84bcf2aa	hi hon, sorry for lack of capitals, my wrist is sprained. <br>    your son could very well fall on the spectrum, but like you said, it's not a bad thing, in fact, knowing it this early will help him be more successful.  my brother is autistic and we didn't find out till he was in high school because he was high functioning.  we continued to get different diagnoses for him until i was in a special ed class in college being trained to be a teacher.  that's when i realized my brother has aspergers.   speak with a doctor, when he is diagnosed with being somewhere on the spectrum, you can then have him go to weekly sessions to help him with his struggles.  this seems like a lot to put on a 19 month old, but this is when his brain is making connections and they will be able to help him make more connections in the way his brain needs to.  plus he is going to have fun during these sessions.  this way he can be more high functioning than low functioning later in life.  and he can also find ways to express himself if he ends up being non-verbal.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	I dont think he has autism, from one mom to another, I have a 22 month old, and he just started saying things such as boat, chocolate (which is super cute to hear) caca for helicopter, and he is just starting to mimic words when he watches a baby einstein videos. I remember a couple months ago he was just jibber jabbering all the time we would go for a walk and he wouldnt stop jabbering, I too thought he was autistic. But if he makes eye contact with you, I doubt it he has autism, take him to the doctor if you really think he's autistic but he sounds just like a healthy almost 2 year old!|`|AA11104372	I am no expert on autism, but this sure sounds like it.  I'm not sure what you mean by "people make it out so bad", but maybe they are concerned that you haven't gotten a professional diagnosis, and are just going on your gut feelings.  Kids with autism do much better,the earlier they are diagnosed, and begin intensive therapy. Good luck.|`|BHkaULukaa	I don't know if what you've described is autism, but it sounds like it is a possibility. Follow your gut.  Go see a doctor and get him tested.  The earlier you do this in his life, the better chance you have of making progress in teaching your son how to do things.  <br>  My nephew was the exact same way at that age.  Because we all saw the signs, his parents got him in to see specialists and eventually he was diagnosed with autism.  I have worked in child care for many years and I have found that children with special needs are really very smart, they just are unable to communicate easily with others.    <br>  I think people make autism out to be so bad because they don't know how to deal with it.  My sister-in-law felt that people were annoyed by her son being involved in things like a preschool Christmas concert.  People seems to forget that children with autism are still children who need to be loved and involved with things.|`|uRKZkBfjaa	I think that 19 months is far too young to make any firm diagnosis. One of the main autistic tendencies is not to want physical contact or have the ability to show emotion,.But you says he laughs and that is a good sign. He is only young to be talking and he is talking in his own toddler way isn't he! <br>  I am not sure why you think he has any disorder he sounds like a normal toddler boy to me, fascinated with wheels and doors and throwing things.<br>  Let him grow at his own pace and don't be worried if he appears to be different from your friends children, they all learn new skills at different times and I would not mention Autism as I feel this is an over reaction at this early age.|`|yxl6GHbRaa	Although i am not Autism Expert I work with those who are....and have obviously picked up a few things.  Autism Can Come at any Age.  Surprisingly Even up early teens.    If started early is at that age that we start noticing  especially if we have other children or have our children around others the same age and see that there is a slight difference although no 2 children are the same even if they are of same age. I  think you should express your concerns with a doctor.  Even though your child might have autistic traits doesn't necessarily mean he is Autistic. He might have some thing else.  I have a 2 year old now, who at first thought she was autistic, Not in the same case as your child but in reverse it is thought that all autism is slower skills, and learning but my daughter was very very very very active....to the point that it was a concern. She did her thing with out any concerns....didn't respond to her name,  at around the same age as your baby.  But Doc said i had nothing to worry about.    I really think that speaking to an actual Expert is the key.
a9btWYKRaa	I think you had every right to react the way you. Yes ok she has medical problems but that does not give her an excuse to treat people the way she does. And as for the way she was with your new born child, There is no person on earth I would let smother my baby as if it were her own.  She has no right at tall to act as if she is the baby's mother!!  Yes you may be feeling jealous but that is more than acceptable and I totally agree with what you said.  She had to be told and she couldn't understand and accept it when you tried the first time, she seems like the type of person who has to be told straight or they will never understand! even if it does seem nasty!!<br>  <br>  I had exactly the same problem with one of my relatives and they are no longer part of my life as they could never accept my daughter wasn't hers.<br>  <br>  You should try and make her understand what she is doing and how it is affecting you and your relationship with your baby. It will more than likely be very hard to do but its worth a try.<br>  <br>  Good Luck anyway and enjoy bonding with your baby, don't let anyway try and take that away from you, its too precious to lose. x|`|9S3Phnf2aa	Apologize so you can be on civil terms. I don't blame you for feeling like you do. She sounds unstable, I'm not sure I would trust her with my baby! However, she is family, and hopefully through this blowup she will get the message and give you some breathing room. It is sad that she does not have a child of her own to love. Can you suggest that she adopt a baby of her own? Be supportive, but stand your ground. Your baby needs YOU not a crazy relative filling her head with negativity. Good luck :)|`|uJ439OrTaa	You are your child's number 1 advocate in life. Therefore all bets are off when it comes to dealing with what other people want. You are your child's mother and you and your husband must absolutely put your baby's needs first and foremost. <br>  Your sister-in-law sounds very mentally unhealthy and should not have much influence on your child. Everyone has a few "nuts" in their families, and we teach our kids to love our family and respect them, but we don't put them in a position of spending great deal of time with those relatives. <br>  I believe you and your husband (he should be dealing with this as well!) should jointly have a conversation with the sister-in-law where it is said that you love her but you feel that she has become too involved in your family. Your family is You, Your husband and Your child. Anyone else is extended family and their needs and wants should not be so essential anymore.<br>  Tell your sister-in-law that if she wants to know your child, she is welcome to come and visit your family in an appropriate way at appropriate times (set a guideline, such as, once per month or once per week, or only at holidays). Let her know that her behavior of possessiveness with your child is not OK and if she can not respect you and your husband's wishes, then she will not have the opportunity to know this child. It is essential that you do this as your child's best advocate for a healthy and nurturing environment.<br>  If it is not possible to have a sit-down chat with the sister-in-law. Write a letter and both of you sign it so that she knows that you and your husband are a joint-force working in the best interests of your child. Protecting your sister-in-laws feelings should not be your first priority.<br>  Good luck!|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I think that I would have done the same thing as you.  There is only so much that one can take, and clearly from what you write, she was overstaying her welcome.  <br>  I would have felt the same, probably said the same and likely would have ended the same(I have a SIL who is controlling and moody and I wish she could take a hint)<br>  I wouldn't feel guilty.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	I think that you could have been a bit more gentle, but I think that you did the right thing in telling her where you stand. She's family. You will work things out in the end. It sounds like she really needs to get her own life. Maybe what you said will help her to realize that.|`|nhgQKvwEaa	Yes you did the right thing, that woman sounds like a freaking nutcase to me...|`|FLpMShKNaa	Don't feel guilty. Her behavior is bizaare, and I would be threatened by someone that possessive of my child. Babies need their mothers, not a confused sis in law with clearly unresolved emotional problems. You are going to have to set some clear boundaries for the sake of your self and especially your daughter. Good luck and God Bless.|`|JV0i77uiaa	You don't have to feel guilty, you did the right thing.  Who want negative people around and let along with your baby.  She is going to spoil your baby.  I think you should keep her away.  You put up with her enough, I don't think I could.  If she get mad at you let it be.  No wonder her mom kicked her out.  She need professional help.  Sometime we have to remove ourself form people like that so they can seek help.  How can everybody be wrong and she is right?  Do me a favor and keep the baby away from her.  God bless you, your family and your baby.|`|c3eb9cc5af710aa695ddf32e0b5e463aaa	I think that it was definitely time to assert yourself in this situation, before your sister-in-law's unhealthy behaviors started impacting your own household and your daughter.<br>  <br>  One thing that I would do, if you haven't done so already, is to sit down with your husband and with a family counselor (your minister may work as well), and discuss what happened. Having your husband's support is going to be very important, and you don't want this to be something that comes between the relationship you and he have. It is important that he see how his sister's behavior was affecting your family, and the potential damage her behavior could do to your daughter, so that both of you can provide a healthy counterpoint, and he can support your breaking away from the unhealthy situation your sister-in-law presented.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend that your sister-in-law get some help in developing herself as an adult, but you can only lead a horse to water...
jvW3a5GYaa	This is not typical behavior for a 9 year old - even given his past. You say he's been through counseling and medication - what was his diagnosis? I'm assuming, since he's been on medication that he has seen a psychiatrist. If I were you I would take him to a different psychiatrist - preferably one who specializes in kids, I would also search the web - look up disorders such as bipolar, ODD (oppositional defiance disorder) ADHD and see if any of these sound like your son. In the meantime, while you are waiting for his doctor appointment start keeping a journal of the events that concern you. Before meeting with the doctor write a list of any medications he has been on in the past and is currently taking (be sure to include dates when the meds were started, when/if they were stopped, how they worked good/bad to relieve symptoms, and any side effects) Once you meet with the doctor it might be a good idea to request a complete mental evaluation to pinpoint the problem.<br>  *edit* It might take some time to find the proper medicines that will help him - my 12 year old daughter has issues and doesn't fit nicely into 1 disorder, it has been a challenge to find the proper mix of medication - I can only encourage you to not give up - remember that your son can't help it - he doesn't want to be this way. You realize he has problems and are seeking help for him at a very young age - this is a very good thing. If his current doctor isn't making a positive difference please get a second opinion. Whatever you do, no matter how bad and hopeless it gets, don't give up on your son.<br>  There is a book on bipolar disorder that has helped us so very much - here's a link to it on Amazon - <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Works-Bipolar-Kids-Parents/dp/1593854072/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235155535&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/What-Works-Bipolar...</a><br>  if you are able to get it I would, it will help.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	Don't let your son hit for gosh sakes spank him<br>  he should know hitting is wrong.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	Hunny, there comes a point in time where you need to know the difference between abuse and discipline.  You are not keeping your son in any type of boundary situation.  Put his butt in military school if you can't bring yourself to punish him.  You also have a responsibility to protect your youngest.  While I have all the sympathy in the world for kids who were abused, you have allowed him to get his way by not taking a stand against him.  You are the parent, he is the child.  I have seen military schools whip kids like him into good kids because it is a strict environment.  Think about it.|`|xQJjTuEWaa	My six year old son was like this bad grades hard time concentrating and the hitting other students and so on and angry outbursts towards me.  I know you said your son is on meds but it does not say what for?  My son was diagnosed with ADHD I had no idea that these could be symptoms of hyper activity but my doc told us that sometimes when they are hyper and can't control themselves they get angry with themselves and lash out at others.  Long story short he has been on med for 6 months now and no more behavior problems and he even made honor roll.  If you have not had him tested for this I would consider it.|`|AA10727113	This is a very serious matter and especially with his age.  Whatever it takes to help finding him a way to deal with his aggression is key.  Counseling is a big thing and getting the root of the problem.  There has to be some reason behind his violence.  Once that is figured out then healing can begin.|`|8580a00b8928b21b7e2a1300aeb99f4faa	I have a nephew like this, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 10, but nothing was done about it.  Now he's 13 and the police have been called at his school and at his home and has spent time in juvenile detention and a psyhiatric ward.  Still, the mother, single, won't put him on meds and blames the father for the problems.  This is a kid that's going to end up in jail shortly and no one can help.  Get the kid to intensive therapy, cause this will be a life long problem.|`|Mm5NsrF8aa	yes I think you need to find a better, or different counselor and doctor...your son does not just have to be this way as that doctor said...and in my non-professional opinion, you should not just take it when he hits you...he needs to find an appropriate outlet for his frustration, anger, etc...do not allow his history of abuse become an excuse for his behavior...do not feel so sorry for him that you do not expect him to be able to learn how to change his behavior...you should expect and insist upon better behavior from him and better counseling and guidance from the professionals|`|pT7jrsAgaa	Hitting is NOT a reflex reaction, but it is understandable in your child considering his horrendous past.  My heart goes out to you and kudos to you for being such a strong mom...do not give up on him!  You mentioned the meds but not if he is actually taking any.  Some meds might can help control his anger.  That's a tough call for any parent deciding to medicate their child.  Behavior redirection counseling might also help him, so he could learn to channel that aggression in a positive way.  Good luck to your family!|`|v0l1JEloaa	You should spank his butt every time he hits you or anyone else and then take a privilege away, like access to television.  He needs to know that it's not ok to hit you or anyone else.  If you're allowing him to hit you and his brother, then you're letting him be in control.  You need to take back the control so spanking is definitely a part of your job as a parent.  Meds won't do anything to him except make him crazy so stop seeing the shrinks! If those meds were really working then he wouldn't have to take them the second time around! Quit wasting your money!<br>  If he doesn't learn who's boss while he's this age, he will probably kill you in your sleep before he's 16.  Not spanking children hasn't helped anyone's child behavior or problems.  You may think he's 'out of control' but you still have authority over him.  Don't let him bully you! He's way smaller than you.  Once he sees that you won't tolerate this behavior any more, he'll stop.  Be the parent, not the child!|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	Next time he hits you or the younger child...take him to the police station. I'm quite serious. It may scare him into straightening up or he may get some actual help. It sounds like no one he is currently seeing has cared to find the RIGHT treatment for him. You are absolutely right in that you need to do so NOW.<br>  I have a permanent scar on my shoulder from when my then 6 year old bit me while driving. I drove straight to the police station where she was determined to be a danger and Baker Acted. <br>  She also, was being abused. Although, even with this Baker Act (her first of several), it was not discovered until years later.<br>  Dig deep for solutions and dig now.|`|Bo4oGgf8aa	I wish I had some advice to give to you, but fortunately I haven't been in that situation.

8t8NjjnVaa	It's okay to eat it.  <br>  <br>  IF your baby has some sort of reaction after you eat it, like she's especially gassy or fussy, then you'll want to avoid it for a while and then try again and see if she has the same reaction.<br>  <br>  Most babies don't have any issue with what the mother eats.  With my first, I could not eat eggs.  They gave my daughter painful gas every single time.<br>  <br>  With my second, nothing bothered her at all.<br>  <br>  Ignore the post that says it won't be in your milk.  That's absolutely false.  Anything you consume can get into your breastmilk, which means your baby may get some MSG in her next feeding or two, but again, unless it bothers her, there's no reason to avoid it in your diet.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	It's 100% OK. The only things that will enter your milk are things that enter your blood-Alcohol. tobacco, etc. MSG does not enter your blood stream and will not be passed to your baby!<br>  <br>  EDIT: The article from "Loves Christmas Lights" simply states the Glutamate is found NATURALLY is breast milk. It does not say that it is "concentrated" in breast milk, nor does it say it enters milk because the mother consumed MSG. It says breast milk contains more glutamate than cow's milk. Not sure how she made the strange conclusion the MSG is passed through a mother's blood, to her milk, and then concentrated.|`|vC4nWjQ4aa	MSG is just fine.  All it is is a combination of salt and meat flavoring, and it has gotten a bad rap.  Research has shown that it has no potential to cause harmful side effects, It has long been thought to be harmful because of one scientist's findings from the 1960s, which has since been refuted.  Eat your Wheat Crunchies without fear!|`|FLpMShKNaa	MSG is fine when nursing.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Read this statement on it, it says the baby will be fine, but it is in your breastmilk, ten times more than in foods, it gets concentrated actually, but that baby will be fine. Read this article, the info is way down towards the bottom. Almost everything you ingest goes into your breastmilk, thats why we stop if you we take certain drugs, or we alter our eating habits sometimes to get someout we eat out of our babies diet.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	While it certainly would be good to avoid MSG it is practically impossible unless you grow your own food.  Every so often I try to do it and I usually give up within 24 hours.  MSG is also listed as:<br>  Accent <br>  Ajinomoto<br>  sapore <br>  wei jing <br>  Monopotassium glutamate  <br>  Glutamate<br>  Glutamic Acid<br>  Vegetable Protein Extract<br>  Hydrolyzed protein<br>  Autolyzed yeast<br>  Hydrolyzed corn gluten  <br>  Natrium glutamate <br>  <br>  <br>  It is certainly true that MSG isn't good for mom, and may be particularly bad for babies because they don't have a mature blood/brain barrier, however most hypoallergenic formula have added MSG.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/mom-foods.html#msg" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/mo...</a><br>   Can I eat foods containing MSG (monosodium glutamate)?<br>  <br>  Human milk normally contains free glutamates (avg. of 22 mg/100g milk). Breastmilk levels are only modestly affected by moms ingestion of MSG. [FSANZ 2003, IFICF 2001, Stegink 1972]<br>  <br>  The American Academy of Pediatrics considers MSG to be compatible with breastfeeding [AAP 2001]. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:NYHMqtFrvqcJ:www.truthinlabeling.org/FDAasked.html+msg+ingredients+other+names&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=ca&client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:NYHM...</a><br>  Some District offices supplied the surveyor with identical lists of some of the ingredients that contain MSG. Some offices said they had no lists, and that when they inquired of their liaison in Washington, they were told that there were no lists of ingredients that contain processed free glutamic acid (MSG).<br>  <br>  A number of FDA representatives suggested resources that they thought might prove helpful. The International Food Information Council (IFIC), an organization paid to promote the sale of monosodium glutamate, a product that contains processed free glutamic acid (MSG), was recommended. Recommended, also, were a number of other groups that represent members of the glutamate industry. But no consumer group was recommended.<br>  <br>  While minimizing the extent and severity of human adverse reactions to processed free glutamic acid (MSG), the FDA officially recognizes that some people react adversely to the substance. The FDA also recognizes that mono and dichloro propanols are produced when processed free glutamic acid (MSG) is produced by acid hydrolysis, and that mono and dichloro propanols are carcinogenic. In the late 1970s, responding to research that demonstrated that free glutamic acid caused brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders, with the greatest risk to infants and young children, baby food manufacturers "voluntarily" removed processed free glutamic acid (MSG) from baby food. More recently, others in the glutamate industry have have responded to consumer concerns by promoting products that carry the advertisement "No added MSG" on their labels -- even though those products contain processed free glutamic acid (MSG). A prime example is the Campbell Soup Company. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askahealer.com/monosodium-glutamate.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.askahealer.com/monosodium-glu...</a><br>  For example, there are quite a few ingredient names used to disquise the presence of monosodium glutamate ( msg ) in products but so far the FDA has not gone after any of the many manufacturers who still use one or more than many ingredient names that contain msg.<br>  <br>  As a person very allergic to msg (monosodium glutamate), and as a person who also has done her homework and knows that msg is an excito-toxin that is poisonous to the body, I am offended that the FDA still allows manufactures to hide this ingredient under so many other names. Here are just a few of the ingredients that "sometimes" contain msg:<br>  <br>  hydrolyzed vegetetable protein, enzyme modified, autolyzed yeast extract, broth, bullion, calcium caseinate, natural flavoring, hydrolyzed oat flour, gelatin, barley malt, pectin, potassium glutamate, malt extract, soy sauce, soy protien, stock, textured protien, maltodextrin,whey protein, yeast extract and natural meat tenderizer.
AA12156890	colic<br>  Severe abdominal pain caused by spasm, obstruction, or distention of any of the hollow viscera, such as the intestines. Often a condition of early infancy, colic is marked by chronic irritability and crying.<br>  <br>  Acid reflux<br>  A burning sensation, usually centered in the middle of the chest near the sternum, caused by the reflux of acidic stomach fluids that enter the lower end of the esophagus.<br>  <br>  Acid reflux treatment:<br>      * Control your weight. Being overweight is one of the strongest risk factors for heartburn. Excess pounds put pressure on your abdomen, pushing up your stomach and causing acid to back up into your esophagus.<br>      * Eat smaller meals. This reduces pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter, helping to prevent the valve from opening and acid from washing back into your esophagus.<br>      * Loosen your belt. Clothes that fit tightly around your waist put pressure on your abdomen and the lower esophageal sphincter.<br>      * Eliminate heartburn triggers. Everyone has specific triggers. Common triggers such as fatty or fried foods, alcohol, chocolate, peppermint, garlic, onion, tomatoes, caffeine and nicotine may make heartburn worse.<br>      * Avoid stooping or bending. Tying your shoes is OK. Bending over for longer periods to weed your garden isn't, especially soon after eating.<br>      * Don't lie down soon after a meal. Wait at least two to three hours after eating before going to bed, and don't lie down right after eating.<br>      * Raise the head of your bed. An elevation of about six to nine inches puts gravity to work for you. You can do this by placing wooden or cement blocks under the feet of your bed at the head end. If it's not possible to elevate your bed, you can insert a foam wedge between your mattress and box spring to elevate your body from the waist up. Wedges are available at drugstores and medical supply stores. Raising your head only by using pillows is not a good alternative. If you need to raise the head of your bed most nights, talk to your doctor because it may indicate GERD and require stronger medication and evaluation.<br>      * Don't smoke. Smoking may increase stomach acid. The swallowing of air during smoking may also aggravate belching and acid reflux. In addition, smoking and alcohol increase your risk of esophageal cancer.<br>  <br>  Colic treatment:<br>      * Feed your baby. If you think your baby may be hungry, try a feeding. Hold your baby as upright as possible, and burp your baby often. Sometimes more frequent - but smaller - feedings are helpful. If you're breast-feeding, it may help to empty one breast completely before switching sides. This will give your baby more hindmilk, which is richer and potentially more satisfying than the foremilk present at the beginning of a feeding.<br>      * Offer a pacifier. For many babies, sucking is a soothing activity. Even if you're breast-feeding, it's OK to offer a pacifier to help your baby calm down.<br>      * Hold your baby. Cuddling helps some babies. Others quiet when they're held closely and swaddled in a lightweight blanket. To give your arms a break, try a baby sling, backpack or other type of baby carrier. Don't worry about spoiling your baby by holding him or her too much.<br>      * Keep your baby in motion. Gently rock your baby in your arms or in an infant swing. Lay your baby tummy down on your knees and then sway your knees slowly. Take a walk with your baby, or buckle your baby in the car seat for a drive. Use a vibrating infant seat or vibrating crib.<br>      * Sing to your baby. A soft tune might soothe your baby. And even if lullabies don't stop your baby from crying, they can keep you calm and help pass the time while you're waiting for your baby to settle down. Recorded music may help, too.<br>      * Turn up the background noise. Some babies cry less when they hear steady background noise. When holding or rocking your baby, try making a continuous "shssss" sound. Turn on a kitchen or bathroom exhaust fan, or play a tape or CD of environmental sounds such as ocean waves, a waterfall or gentle rain. Sometimes the tick of a clock or metronome does the trick.<br>      * Use gentle heat or touch. Give your baby a warm bath. Softly massage your baby, especially around the tummy.<br>      * Give your baby some private time. If nothing else seems to work, a brief timeout might help. Put your baby in his or her crib for five to 10 minutes.<br>      * Mix it up. Experiment to discover what works best for your baby, even if it changes from day to day.<br>      * Consider dietary changes. If you breast-feed, see if eliminating certain foods from your own diet - such as dairy products, citrus fruits, spicy foods or drinks containing caffeine - has any effect on your baby's crying. If you use a bottle, a new type of bottle or nipple might help.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Colic is best defined as 'excessive crying in a young baby that cannot be explained by medical causes such as reflux, allergies, excessive gas, etc.'<br>  <br>  So .. if baby has reflux, and, when treated effectively baby no longer cries excessively, then baby does NOT have colic.<br>  <br>  There is no real cure or treatment for colic -- just doing whatever you can to make baby feel better AND keep mom sane. <br>  <br>  Reflux can be treated with medication, changes in feeding patterns and, occassionally, special thickened formulas.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Acid reflux as in adults is acid from our stomach coming up into the esphorgus, heart burn. Colic is a term for a fussy baby, but usually is used when the baby is suffering gas, they can have horrible painful gas. There are many techniques for burping and its best to learn and explore them.  Breast feeding moms need to speak to their pediatrician and see if the dr wants them to alter their diet to try to help less gas be in baby.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Colic means they do not know what the cause is.  Its a diagnosis that can only be made in the absence of all other conditions and even then its probable there is no such thing but rather that colic is many different things which we have no tests for.<br>  <br>  Treatments for colic have ranged from sedatives, to simple changes in parenting practices.  Largely sedatives have been abandoned.  Mild drugs and herbal treatments like simethicone (gas drops), gripe water, teas, etc are often recommended though studies show they make no difference.<br>  <br>  Holding the baby, or using a baby carrier for most of the day has been shown to reduce colic.  So has feeding more often and in smaller amounts.<br>  ==================<br>  GERD -Gastroesophageal reflux disease, is a two part condition in babies.  There must be frequent reflux from the stomach and that reflux must be causing discomfort and usually physical damage.<br>  <br>  Reflux is normal in infants, their stomachs are not full developed so food can easily slosh back up into the esophagus and even out their mouth and/or nose.  Unlike an adult they don't fight it and don't care.  Most adults resist throwing up.<br>  <br>  There are many treatments, and many causes of GERD the three main treatments are:<br>  *Acid reducers, which reduce the production of acid in the stomach which reduces the pain from reflux, but not the frequency or amount.<br>  *Drugs that increase gastric emptying, this reduces the amount of time the food is in the stomach and therefore minimizes how long after a meal reflux can occur<br>  * Allergies, many cases persistent reflux is caused by an underlying allergy.  In that case that food must be removed from the diet.<br>  <br>  However the most important, and so often neglected, treatment for GERD is always behavioural.  Crying must be limited as it makes GERD worse.  Babies must be fed carefully to ensure they don't swallow air, and carefully positioned after feeds to prevent reflux.  They should be fed small amounts more often, smaller meals leave the stomach faster, are less likely to come back up because the stomach isn't as full, and breastmilk in particular is a powerful antacid so frequent meals reduce the pain from reflux.  Sucking can reduce reflux.  Etc|`|hVVALFAPaa	Timing essentially.<br>  <br>  Acid reflux will occur after each feeding or when the baby is laying down. In general, they don't seem happy and they may not gain weight or even lose weight. They may even not want to eat. It will last well into baby hood until the baby is more upright (like about 6 months, when they learn to sit up alone.) though it may last into toddlerhood. Treatment is to try to keep the baby upright even sleeping in a carseat or swing. Changing formulas perhaps and even some medications.<br>  <br>  Colic shows up at about the same time each day and lasts about the same length of time each day. The baby cries and cries and seems to be in pain but nothing you do seems to calm him. The rest of the time, the baby seems absolutely fine. Colic usually stops on its own and  ends for good at about 3 months. There is no tried and true way to treat colic. You could try putting your baby in a carseat and putting him on the washing machine (the jiggling sometimes works) or going for car rides or playing music and some parents give them mylecon (to help with gassiness) but there are no guarantees.<br>  <br>  For example, my son had colic and he would start crying every day at 6:30 pm and cry non stop until 9:30, then eat and fall asleep. He gained weight and was healthy and normal in everything else.<br>  <br>  My daughter had acid reflux. She spit up a lot after each feeding, was miserable around the clock and stayed at the 10% in weight until she was 2 years old.
vue9NOhYaa	With a 28-30 day cycle, you probably ovulate between days 12 and 18 -- so I'd start 'trying' in about 9-10 days, and continue until you are certain you've ovulated. (No more fertile mucus, or BBT shows ovulation.) Or use an ovulation predictor kit starting around day 10.<br>  <br>  (It's best to start trying before ovulation, because sperm can live several days in your body, but the egg dies in about a day if not fertilized.)|`|VHHis05Naa	Today is Day 1 of your cycle.  On days 10,12, 14, 16, and 18 since your cycle isn't long.  It's impossible to tell when you are ovulating, but those dates are a good place to start.  Pick up an ovulation kit or start charting.  Track your basal body temp and cervical mucous every day starting the day after your period has ended.  <br>  <br>  Sperm can live up to 3-5 days inside the body.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	2 weeks from today|`|e12a1f2ed505be8021ede0df33b7238faa	Start BD'ing every other day beginning March 4th (CD12), with actual ovulation taking place around March 6th or 7th.  You will probably ovulate around CD14-CD17.  Chart your temps starting now and refer to the FAQ on www.fertilityfriend.com to help understand the changes.  Pretty much, once your temp rises for several days in a row, you've already ovulated.  Watch your cervical mucus and be sure to BD when you notice clear, watery/stretchy, egg-white-like mucus.  This is the most fertile mucus and prime for conceiving.  When you ovulate, the cervical mucus tends to dry up.  Also, checking your cervix helps to pinpoint when you ovulate.  When you're most fertile, the cervix will be high, soft and open.  After ovulation, it will be low, firm and closed.  I hope this helps!!|`|QB5D0rG4aa	Ovulation occurs 14 to 18 days before the next period|`|8mchLCQhaa	14 days form today should be around the time you ovulate.|`|c3eb9cc5af710aa695ddf32e0b5e463aaa	Ovulation occurs 14 days before the next period, and the most fertile time is during the day of ovulation and the 2-3 days following ovulation.

Let me tell you something. I was 6w3d and I was diagnosed with a blighted ovum. The doctor pretty much said that I was in the begining stages of a miscarriage.

1F6KJt0oaa	Not often if it is taken exactly right (same time every day never miss a day and all that stuff).  It does happen though.  I have several friends whose children were pill babies.  2 days late though isn't anything to be worried about.  You can go a head and do a home pregnancy test.  We have figured out that until you are a week or more late you can't get too worked up and there isn't anything you can do but test it.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Not often, no.  But occassionally.  (Taken correctly, it's better than 99% effective -- meaning less than one pregnancy per 100 women per year of use.)  So the odds are low ... but SOMEONE has to be that one woman per 100....)<br>  <br>  If you haven't missed any pills and are having no pregnancy symptoms, you are almost certainly NOT pregnant.  You could be a bit late this month, or even miss your period this month.  You could do a test to set your mind at ease, or just start your new pack on schedule.<br>  <br>  If you miss another period, or have preganncy symptoms, stop the pills and see your doctor to confirm or rule out pregnancy.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	Pills are supposedly 99.9% effective.  However, certain things can interact with the pill and make it not as effective. Antibiotics for instance can counteract the effectiveness of the pill.  Or if your body has grown accustomed to the dosage and a higher dosage is needed (if you've been on the same pill for years).   <br>  <br>  It could just be stress that's delaying your period.  Or if you've been sick with a cold or the flu or something like that recently -- that can cause your period to be late.  You may want to go ahead and take a pregnancy test to be sure though.|`|uIlmjJjhaa	*****!! you preggy!! dont worry, if you are and you want to abort, eat a tub of butter a day, it creates a natural abortion, also try drinkin lots of alchol, mixed with bleach.|`|AA11784984	It is possible.

You can't ground an adult.|`|AA11210211	Legally no he can't if he bought it with his own money,but most don't think legally in this situation so I would say yes he can be.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I have an 18 year old in the house and he has to follow our rules OR ELSE....and if that OR ELSE includes grounding him from something he bought, so be it....it's a privilege to live in our house and be fed and clothed etc.<br>  <br>  Is your 18 year old whining about your choice of restrictions?  GOOD, it will motivate them to become independent.  That's what you tell him or her, "when you are out on your own, you can set your own rules, but this is my house, my rules."|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	If he lives in his parents house they make the rules so yes.|`|AA11104372	If he is being supported by his parents, yes.  Their house=their rules.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	yes, as long as he's still living at home he can.<br>  Parents Rule!|`|FiUprYsvaa	They are 18, they bought it legally, they own it legally.<br>  It cannot be taken from them.<br>  <br>  Things that were bought for the teen can be though.|`|AA11784984	If he still lives in his parents house they can pretty much ground him from anything, even if he bought it.|`|ZN5bBNevaa	if he is living with his parents yes they do but he pays rent or house bills than ibelieve no because he is supporting himself or herself|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	If he is living in your home, off of your income..then yes. But if he isn't living in your home..or if he is paying you rent...then no.|`|AA10475412	If they bring home something inappropriate, yes, if they are under the same roof with their parents.|`|sv4guUQNaa	When I was 18 my parents could try but I don't think they could've successfully grounded me.|`|MCTyWCu2aa	Well if hes living under his parents roof they can do whatever they want.|`|g8NiwNKEaa	If he still lives at home with his parents, you darn skippy!!!|`|c3eb9cc5af710aa695ddf32e0b5e463aaa	If he's still living at home, and is still under his parent's authority, yes, he could be. If he doesn't want to accept being grounded from whatever it is, he may find that he has to take on other responsibilities of being a full adult (things like paying rent on his own place, or paying for his own school, etc.), where he would no longer have the advantages of his parents household, but he would also not be subject to their authority on their own turf.|`|6ztG71Zvaa	No, certainly not! an 18 year old is too old to be grounded anyway!<br>  You are an adult, not a child! i think you may have to remind your parents about this fact!<br>  If you have done something wrong your parent's should discuss it with you"like adults"  and they should treat you like one too instead of treating you like a child.<br>  we all make mistakes in life, that's how we learn! your parents should be there to support you through the mistakes you make in life. not lock you away! fight your corner.<br>  Good luck|`|cteyFJxhaa	Like if he works and buys a car and has his own insurance and so forth?  Then no, I personally don't agree with that.<br>  <br>  If mommy takes away his ipod that he bought with the birthday money that she gave him?  Yes.<br>  <br>  18 is a tricky age.  Some 18 yo's are adults........some are not......|`|8580a00b8928b21b7e2a1300aeb99f4faa	If it's in the house and taking space at the person doing the grounding, yes.  When you live on your own, you can make the rules.|`|F3BRG72iaa	well if the 18 year old still lives with his parents of course he can.. he's the one who wants to live with them and has to suffer the consequences.|`|4231f37a6ec49e1a93dc5bc1df21349daa	if he's living under an authority figure, in their house/rules, not his own. Yes. Definitely.|`|z0gdLgQ4aa	Time to move out!
FvGABavNaa	Absolutely gorgeous, I love the name Sophia! It seems very sophisticated and will definitely last her through the many stages of her life :)|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	yes.  it sounds very peaceful and elegant|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Yes|`|tu7aqUoxaa	yea, it's ok|`|7Dpz81d5aa	I love it!!    Hope I helped :-)|`|TRkpG3MPaa	yes. its sounds simple and pretty.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	VERY beautiful! Sophia Grace is much better than Hannah Kathryn.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	It's classy and beautiful.  It's definately a name that will grow with your child, too.  I love it.|`|1OKx4TYpaa	Sophia is the 6th most popular name for girls in the US.  Enough said?|`|WsqrkZL1aa	Yes, and do many many other people. Sophia happens to be one of the most popular names in the country and Grace is the most popular middle name. So pretty? most definitely. Unusual? Not a tad.|`|IvkNTqDMaa	Sophia Grace is MUCH prettier than Hannah Kathryn.|`|1veacHkjaa	That is so beautiful! Good job! I love it!
Kr09aQJkaa	If I had 14 dogs in a 2 bedroom home the police would be carting me off to jail and giving me a hefty fine. Something is truly wrong with this world if someone gives her a tv show.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	This is my opinion...Jon and Kate disturb me.If they only wanted one more, ( which she states in the intro), they could have had ivf. Do they really need 8 kids?? And why the tv show?And they never use reg plates they always use paper plates to eat on, ( anyone notice that), what a waste on the environment, ( my opinion).And the women with the 14 kids,needs a job to support her offspring cause the american public does not want to be responsible for her stupidity.|`|29Lrkdunaa	I think the whole thing is disturbing. The doctor should lose his license. The worst part of this deal is that there is now 14 kids who are going to suffer. I don't want my tax dollars to be spoon fed to this irresponsible woman but it's hard not to help out the kids.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	What I don't understand is why this lady thinks she's all special.  I mean, who cares? I wouldn't buy her book, watch her movie, or buy anything she was paid an endorsement for.   This woman sold her ovarian eggs at 10 thousand dollars an egg to support herself. She has 2 houses. Can you imagine the number of children on this earth that share half of her DNA?  I think it's pretty narcissistic of her.  I mean, who does she think she is? She's nobody. If we all ignore her maybe she'll go away.|`|TQW5E6olaa	The whole situation disturbs me so much, it disgusts me that she has an agent, she hasn't been released from the hospital and she has an agent...|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	Yeah I think that the woman with the octuplets has some kind of mental illness. Seriously!? why on earth would you have IVF when you already have 6 kids that you need help with? And now she wants her own show? Please. The last thing that woman needs is more publicity. I have a hard time thinking that she even deserves help. It's not like she was taking care of the 6 kids she had on her own before she decided she wanted more. More then anything though I feel bad for those kids.   As far as Jon & Kate-I'm pretty sure that they're just used to the cameras at this point and I wouldn't be surprised if TLC bothers them to keep it up because it's such a popular show. I believe they got the show because if public interest at the time and it being a weird unique situation.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	these people will have soo much money given to them  just for having 8 kids that lived  ontalk shows and baby product sponsors and community fund raisers   they are set|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Jon and Kate were approached about doing the TV show.  They never considered it beforehand.  The mother of octuplets considered it on her own- no one approached her about it.  I love Jon and Kate plus 8 because they actually seem like responsible parents, though sometimes they do make mistakes.  (What parent doesn't?)  But this lady with 14 kids- I have no respect for her.  I think I might watch an episode just to see- but one episode is my limit.
j2mRop0laa	Awesome! Well, as you know I'm getting my *second* laptop today, since the first time was a bust.    I checked the ups tracking and it says *out for delivery*. woohoo. I can't wait to download a bunch of stuff on it and break it in.|`|KHZLPldraa	YES!! I am waiting on the acceptance from the IRS because I e-filed my tax returns this morning!!!    Congrats on your phone.  I like the shine!|`|AA10186411	I have an LG shine, and I absolutely love it! lol  I am not looking forward to anything right now...just hoping my daughter's father disappears off the face of the earth! lol   But I know what you mean, if I am expecting a package, it really gets me excited! lol|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	a house literlly !

We're currently sharing a car while mine gets fixed, so I'm often trapped at home (there's nothing in walking distance).|`|dq04utMoaa	I am looking forward to alot of things,  1. getting my husband's last w2 ( so we can file our taxes and pay off our credit cards and buy some baby stuff..  2. Having my last child this month hopefully..  3. my son behaving at school  4. enjoying my life !!!!!    Congrads on your new phone...

YAY!|`|zAKFuGGiaa	I can't wait to get home to spend some time with my daughter!|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	Yep, my 8 year old should be bouncing up the driveway any minute. My 6 month old is waiting patiently in the front window for her. When she gets home, we are going swimming at the y-center.|`|OxFV92hJaa	Not today. I'm waiting for tomorrow though! See the surgeon to get a date booked to remove my darn gallbladder! lol It's gonna suck, but I'm going to be happy to not be in pain and so sick anymore. (once the suregery pain goes away of course) It's been a pain in my side (literally), for almost a year.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Warning...  We got an LG Shine a few months ago.  The LCD screen broke on it within a week.  Husband just had it in his pocket while grocery shopping - didn't drop it or anything...  Turns out it's a pretty common problem if you search it on the internet.      What am I looking forward to?  Saturday!  Kids are going for a sleepover at friends while husband & I go to our own grownup sleepover at a nearby hotel, in the hot tub suite, across the street from a retro disco.  Ahhh!  I'm like a kid waiting for Christmas!
AA11694281	You need clothes that are at least newborn but usually 0-3 months because they do not move like real babies. They can be stiff and hard to get into clothes. So I would suggest if you are buying clothes for it you buy bigger than newborn.|`|glYQY52maa	it had clothes and also an extra pair. and get prepared to not sleep at all its really annoying!|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	idk...mine had clothes.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	We didn't do that at our school. They didn't want to promote teen pregnancy.    Hey, it wasn't my choice!|`|Jn7bt3JTaa	We had an egg.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	My egg cracked and went bad.|`|3ec2dc9c564affe4311fe2b01585ad71aa	Mine is wearing 3-6 months clothes. But i'm not sure if we have the same type of child.|`|zhrGiQsKaa	people in my school had those! they used to cry all the time during class. it is like a newborn baby or infant size clothing. only the people who took child care in my school got those babies. child care was the daycare in the school for the teachers kids in preschool and the students would teach the kids for 2 periods in a row a day.|`|01vMpHkWaa	IF your school offers it, it will be about the size of a 5 month old  i have held a fake one before...  they are expensive dolls though so many school parenting classes do eggs or flour bags    depends on your school's budget though|`|LnL2T4oIaa	In high school depending on what classes you choose to take. and clothes are provided.|`|sDHxandWaa	Ours had clothes on them already.
92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	Since my miscarriage at 5 1/2 weeks in December, my cycle seems to reset, for the better.  My cycles last fall were 37 to 40 days long, with ovulation not happening until 23 to 27 days into my cycle.  (I BBT, etc.)   Since my miscarriage, my next period came on Jan 26, 32 days after my miscarriage,  and I ovulated around day 19 of my cycle.   Again now, in February, I know I ovulated on day 18 of my cycle, which I am very happy about.   Those long cycles were really getting me down and frustrated, and I wondered if that was the reason I miscarried - because the cycle I conceived, I didn't ovulate until at least day 24!   So, I am hopeful this month as we really started trying again.|`|vGRSTarTaa	this isnt exactly the same, but my son was stillborn on jan.18th, at 22 weeks. amid the horror of that event and the my recovery, i had retained placenta and so bled for 3 weeks. 1 week later my cycle returned. exactly 28 days after his birth, it was very strange i thought to return so quickly, so i can relate to your confusion over it.<br>  perhaps it is resetting its self?
A5MXPeO4aa	sounds like congestion or wind to me but get it checked out by your dr if u r unsure.    hope you and your baby are well and that you are enjoying him. congratulations|`|r5R2nstRaa	either asthma or mucus. take your baby to the doctor. that's the only way you will know what it is.|`|AA12057835	how old is he now?  My son was like that for the first 2 months of his life.  The pediatrician had me take my son into a specialist, saying it could be something with his throat. (I forget the medical term for it).  Specialist checked it out and confirmed that it was just that....basically that the muscles in the larynx weren't as strong as they should be and it causes the throat to sort of "collapse".  They assured me that this was quite common in children and would go away by the time he is 1.  He is 6 months now and it went away by the 4th month.  If it is a cause for concern, talk to your doctor.  But it sounds just like my situation.|`|mW2HP40Raa	my baby also had this. she snored, she had a rattling chest, she sounded mucousy when she nursed--all that.     my doctor told me this is normal in new babies. shes 4 months old now and it has pretty much gone away.    what you describe sounds normal to me. run it by the doctor if it worries you though. you could also google this--there are a lot of parents out there with the same concern.
UiXJLrDWaa	just dont eat too much cause the salt makes you swollen.|`|ZF02ozgLaa	NO!!! youll explode! lol jk.... if its not affecting you before you were pregnant then its not going to do anything but feed your baby lol|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	omg thats all i ate when i was pregnant with my first son. stay away from some cheeses like feta and sushi, shell fish, deli meats unless you heat them to I believe 160 degrees|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	You sure can.  How do you know you're pregnant at 3 weeks?  That'd make you about 5 weeks then. Pregnancy is counted from the first day of your last period.|`|AA11981363	yes, you can eat anything, just in moderation. If they are salty make sure you drink plenty of water after..|`|9FbcLKsfaa	oh i loooove olives, just dont sit there and eat them all day! Its a healthy snack actually! Just stay away from shell fish, cold cuts etc. im sure there are more but a lot of the times i dunno what im talking about and i dont wanna tell you the wrong thing.|`|SO3aE2RMaa	yes you can...i love them !!|`|DWLfKACYaa	Yes, you can eat them
bzkSIJYnaa	I like Miranda better! That's my favorite name EVER! I love Mirabella, but I prefer simply Mirabel/Mirabelle. But I still prefer Miranda - I love it!!|`|CxRJwJsraa	gah, I like both of them. I think I slightly prefer Miranda.    However, I think I'd prefer Mirabel to all.|`|TRkpG3MPaa	I like Mirabella. its unique.|`|7Dpz81d5aa	Miranda.    Hope I helped :-)|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	Miranda.

I don't like Miranda at all for some reason....sorry.|`|UXoTCL98aa	Mirabella is really cute and different. Plus there are a lot of different nicknames you could use for that one  Mira, Belle, Bella, Miree|`|536af1d5775b5f4d1ee77ec280e3bcd1aa	I LOVE Mirabella. It just rolls off the tongue so nicely, and I've never known a Mirabella. Miranda is kinda common and I don't really like it personally.|`|5wt0En1Zaa	I prefer Miranda. It's easier to say it.  Mirabella sounds a bit more uniquie, but I think people might make fun of that name. Not that they will, just my personal opinion.  Just choose what your heart says :)|`|FfyVPvEYaa	I've always loved the name Miranda, still do!|`|Q9BNAK7waa	Miranda is classic and beautiful while Mirabella is really ugly|`|MuKiALlwaa	I like Mirabella, but I like the sound of Mirabelle more.

vue9NOhYaa	Advil is catagory B (same as Tylenol) in the first two trimesters.|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	Advil should only be avoided in the third trimester because it can make your blood pressure high.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	She should be fine since she's so early. but if she's trying for a baby, its better safe than sorry. Tell her to take tylenol instead. Thats the only pain reliever my doctor told me is safe to use during pregnancy.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	Wasn't it you asking if you could take advil just a second ago? If you took advil... you'll be fine. Just don't do it again.|`|6mhFHSRSaa	I had the same situation in my first pregnancy - I was in very early pregnancy, didn't know it, and took ibuprofen (the active ingredient of Advil) to bring down a fever. When I went to the doctor, I was told not to worry about it, but I was also advised to use acetaminophen in the future.    Fever is potentially quite dangerous to a developing baby. Depending on how high the fever is, sometimes a fever will be more damaging to a developing baby than a fever-reducing drug. That said, drug of choice for most doctors is acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol), and it's best to get medical advice before taking any medication in pregnancy.    For future reference, Ibuprofen is a class D drug in the US during the third trimester, which means it has known teterogenic effects -- it can cause defects. Class D drugs may also be used in pregnancy if the positive effect of the drug outweighs the risks. That is for a doctor to decide, and they will usually advise you to take other drugs that accomplish the same thing if there are choices available.  The good news is that during the first two trimesters, it is class B, which means that it is considered fairly safe.    As for how much damage a little Advil would do to a baby at that stage of development, I'm not sure, but I doubt it would be much, if any. A doctor may be able to provide some insight. I think the advice I was given may be the best thing to keep in mind for now: don't worry about it! Women do all kinds of things they "shouldn't" when they are first pregnant and don't understand the risks or don't know that they are expecting. Quite often, the baby suffers no harm, and worrying about the mistakes we made won't fix anything.
Uu9qXGGuaa	first you need to talk to her about what she wants to do about location...whether she plans to stay there when you leave or come with you.  then if worse case scenario you will have to decide to stay there or leave and work something out with the mother about seeing your child and how you are going to provide for him/her. btw, congrads|`|kZRTekoJaa	you should talk to her, and ask her what she wants to do. you still have a year left to figure it all out so be thankful for that at least...  no one on y!a can really make this choice for you. and it seems like your only choices are to stay in europe with them, move back to the US without them, or convince her to move back to the US with you..    if you really want to move back to the US talk to her. she might be open to moving here as well.  if she doesn't want to move i would recommend you stay there b/c i am not the "run away from your responsibilities" type, or supporter. but again, it's obviously your choice so good luck with it.  who knows, she may even be open to some kind of shared custody arrangement (like the kid lives with you summers, her during the school year, or something similar). it would be difficult, but doable if it's what the two of you really wanted. but it would most likely cost a small fortune over the years unless airfare gets cheaper.|`|A8OVGLdiaa	talk to her that is she wants to move with u...u gotta sort this out cuz one of you will have to move if u really love each other.|`|DWLfKACYaa	stay with her
8c2b5ce01a4c3f933b69d72b899c6d2caa	awsome thanks for sharing!
FkGh0LuWaa	Thank You!  I will check them out.
SRsFkNBBaa	i answered your other one too. i can't beleive this even happened-i know you were totally horrified! yes, i would contact the other parents. they need to know what went on over there. they need to see the tape and be there to back you up. i think it will help you decide what to do from there. you could all go together. you could also guage the parents reactions as well. if one of them thinks that it is no big deal, then you know from then on, that your daughter can steer clear of them too. good luck!|`|9LWuWHiMaa	I believe that our children are being exposed to sex before they are mature enough to handle it. i would notify who i need to notify. your child is better off out of that circle of friends. she will survive. if you know the truth then you have to alert other parents about it. this father needs to be outed. let ppl know, he is a pervert if he sat and watched the boys undress themselves he might be a pedophile for all you know talk and clear your conscience|`|29Lrkdunaa	I would rethink letting my daughter hang out with the 16 year old from now on. Seems she might not have much parental guidance at home.|`|xcEWVJB0aa	if your daughter will give you the video you can always make a new email account if you want it to be anonymous an use a different name an send the school principle the video because the wrestling coach is in it and allowing it to happen him and the boys should get in trouble and why would the parents even let boys be all over their daughter like that an if you want id contact the parents just to ask about it an be as nice as you can an just ask why it happened|`|h6b4kNm4aa	OMG yes that is so rong that would piss me off NO WAY you should  your daughter see that smut .|`|ZabDX17Oaa	You have to protect your daughter first and foremost.  This type of behavior is completely inappropriate for kids of that age.  If it was my daughter I would be calling the parents of the other kids and letting them know exactly what happened when they weren't with there kids.  This videotape can be used as evidence if the parents think you are making it up.  Your daughter may get mad at you and may have to deal with her friends being upset with her for a while but it's the right thing to do.  Her true friends will stick by her and one day when your daughter has her own children she will understand just why mom reacted in such a way.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I wouldn't let her attend any more parties there.  If the parents ever should ask why she's not allowed over their house anymore then you could let them know how inappropriate the behavior at party was.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	totally in appropriate  kiddy porn at a 16 yr old party  irresponsible adults incouraging it  I'd call the cops|`|C22jeMVhaa	File a report with the police and I would ssssoooooooo give those parents a piece of my mind. OMG.|`|0MY2pm5Xaa	well me being a teen, I think u should tell the parents through a note with no name or anything dropped in their mailbox! They should get a piece of ur mind but without ur daughter having to pay 4 it! Hope that helped!|`|LNnRSLdtaa	its just a bit of fun   lighten up  and she will get **** from the other kids if you talk to her parents     its not like they were naked  its just a bit of light hearted fun|`|2BhDBYDPaa	my thought is why would a FATHER encourage his daughter to watch that..she isnt ready for sex!! if she saw his penis the dudes that were dancing got hte extra "PARTY" i would give thos eparents my mind...thats just sick AND basically CHILD PORN!|`|A8OVGLdiaa	i would have talked to the parents atleast once...tell her parents not to involve kids in that...i mean kids don't have to know abt things that parents talked abt in this case.|`|H67nCOyHaa	DONT YOU DARE!!!!!!!!!!! If you love ur daughter at all u will not put her through that... so what she saw a penis, it was not that she planned it, those parents were fine with it what are parents problems anymore??? so strict about everything.......|`|q6TSRzr7aa	I think you should call the parents and tell them off. Because I don't think that your daughter should be exposed to that. If the kids at school tease her you could just tell the principal. She'll be okay if she knows that she has loving parents.|`|5ZbFdcwdaa	Let this one go. Don't embarrass your daughter by complaining, I'm sure she would have seen worse than that. If things like this happen again with the same parents you should consider contacting the parents. The kids were just having fun and probably didn't mean any harm.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	yea i would call there is something seriously wrong with that|`|qImMwhUHaa	Wow, that is completely inappropriate. i would not only contact the party attendees parents but also the wrestlers under this guy's supervision's parents. I would want to know.|`|GuK9yLGJaa	as far as what you should do to save your kids social life im not sure but that father sounds like a serious weirdo
VTwirbhUaa	Sophie Eve defenately, it is a pretty name and it sounds modern, yet it is an older time name|`|Uu9qXGGuaa	I like Sophie Eve.  It just flows better.  But the best thing for her to do is to yell the name out like you were calling the kid or if you were mad.  It will help with the flow of the name|`|coVZ1uqCaa	Sophia Eve flows better in my opinion. I like it. It's a really calming name in my perspective. Oh, did you know, those two names together means 'Wisdom Life'? It's a beautiful combination, by the way. I wish. your friend the best (:    edit : I just found out it's actually Sophie Eve ; Try asking her to change it to Sophia Eve.    -----|`|kZ9TTWZ9aa	sophia eve by far eve sophia is really flashy and trashy|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I like Sophia Eve.|`|J6WSMpTlaa	Sophie Eve  sound better  but, try changing it into Sophia Eve|`|vsoYHMq0aa	Sophie Eve really but heres another Sienna Autumn|`|7Dpz81d5aa	Sophia Eve!!    Hope I helped :-)|`|X9T9iVVhaa	Sophia Eve would be beautiful!  It flows well together and sounds really pretty.|`|A7Aa4ycPaa	Eve Sophia! The 'ee' sounds in Sophie Eve run into each other and make it sound like one word.   Anyways, Sophia/Sophie is really popular right now - much as I love it! You don't meet many Eves though!
ibeYAlwpaa	i love the name holly... but perhaps i am a little biased. (my name is holly)  Camden holly grace sounds good.|`|hSTNMnFPaa	Aaren~ I much prefer the spelling Erin (my name). Aaren looks like a misspelled Aaron, which is a totally different name than Erin (Erin is Irish, meaning "Ireland" and Aaron is biblical, meaning "lofty").    Abigail~ Extremely common and overused. The name has never sounded pretty to me in the least, anyway.    Aimee~ Kind of pretty. I like French names and, though this one is pretty popular, I still don't mind it.    Anabelle~ I like the spelling Annabelle better, but I'm not the biggest fan of this name. I always think of the Christmas movie "Annabelle's Wish", in which Annabelle was a cow (literally).    Anne~ Very pretty! I love this name, plain as it is. There's something graceful and elegant about this one.    Bethany~ Eh, not a huge fan, sorry.     Brooke~ Nice, but only as a middle name.    Caitlin~ Common, but still quite pretty. And I love that you used the traditional spelling.    Camden~ I prefer Cameron and I like both much better on a boy.    Carolyn~ Quite pretty. I like Caroline a bit better, though.    Cassandra~ I really adore this for a middle name. As a first name it always reminds me of the Greek story in which Cassandra was a prophet who no one ever believed.    Chloe~ Really like this one.     Clover~ Not a fan, at all.    Daisy~ Again, a bit to "cowy" for my liking.    Delilah~ Oh, gorgeous! My favorite girl name! So elegant, classy and underused! Plus, it has the adorable nickname option of Lila.    Derryth~ I've never heard of it. If it's pronounced how it looks, I don't care for it at all.    Diana~ I quite like it. It always reminds me of the Roman goddess of the moon.    Eden~ Another one of my favorites! So pretty!    Ellen~ Don't like this one at all.    Esme~ I prefer the spelling Esme, which is lovely. I like it best as a middle name though.     Genesis~ Really can't stand the Trinity, Genesis, Nevaeh names. They're trashy and overused.    Grace~ Too common and bland as a first and middle name.    Hannah~ See Grace. I really couldn't picture a grown woman with this name being taken seriously.    Holly~ Not bad. I don't personally love it, but it's okay.    Hope~ No, don't like this at all.    Jasmine~ Not my favorite flower name, but it's okay. It reminds me of the princess from Aladdin.    Jezebel~ You do know that this name is synonymous with harlot or floozy, right? Not a good association at all.     Joy~ A little plain.    Kahlan~ I'm not sure how to pronounce this, so I can't really form an opinion.    Kimberley~ I like Kimberly better, but I don't like it to begin with.     Leslie~ Ew, no not at all!    Lilith~ I really don't care for names that end in "th". This is a bit of a mouthful.    Matilda~ Ew, ew, ew! I can't stand this name! It just sounds like a bunch of harsh consonants mushed together and isn't very pretty at all.    Millicent~ Ew.    Naomi~ Pretty, and I really like its meaning ("beautiful").    Natasha~ Lovely!    Niamh~ I didn't really mind this name until I had a dream that it was my name and I despised it, lol.     Pearl~ Much too old-sounding.    Quinn~ For a girl? No, definitely not. A boy? Yes, lovely.    Rachel~ A little plain and 70s sounding.    Rhiannon~ No, not a fan.    Romany~ I like Roman for a boy, but Romany is just weird.    Ryana~ Don't care for it.    Seve~ No!    Shannon~ A little common, but I guess it's okay.    Sian~ Not a huge fan, even though I like a lot of Welsh names.    Skye~ Don't like it at all, a bit trashy.    Tamsin~ Actually, I don't mind this one.    Vanessa~ One of the few 80s names I like. Vrey pretty and classy.    Violet~ Stunning! Simply gorgeous name!    Verna~ No, definitely not.    Willow~ Very pretty, another one of my favorites!    Zoey~ I prefer the spelling Zo or Zo?. The "y" seems unnecessary.    Aaron~ Don't mind it. A little common, but okay.    Atticus~ Sounds like abacus, which is a 16th century Asian counting device.    Basil~ Ew. Very pompous sounding.    Caden~ The only "-aden" name I can tolerate, save Haden. But it's rapidly getting extremely overused.    Caleb~ Don't mind this at all. Very handsome.    Daniel~ A bit boring, to be frank.    David~ See Daniel.    Elliot~ I adore it! Very masculine and underused, although I do prefer the spelling Elliott.    Freddie~ Kruger? No.    Harrison~ Ford? Lol, again, no.    Harry~ Potter? Haha, okay, I'll stop. This name, on one hand, I like because, let's face it, I'm a bit of a Harry Potter nerd. But on the other hand, it's too much like the word "hairy".    Isaac~ I always picture a 60s guy with a huge afro and gold, bell-bottom pants whenever I hear this name.    Jake~ I prefer it only as a nickname for Jacob.    James~ Wonderful! Strong, classic and masculine!    Kenton~ No, don't like it.    Kenyon~ Again, don't like it.    Liam~ Very nice, this I really like.    Matthew~ Much too common.    Nathan~ A bit wimpy-sounding to me. But that's just because I know someone with this name.    Nicodemus~ ??? I have no idea what that even is.    Oliver~ One of my favorites!    Ryan~ Very common. Every other guy I know is named this.    Zacharias~ Much prefer Zachary.    ? Q???|`|mH5jEhbHaa	LESLY|`|3ec2dc9c564affe4311fe2b01585ad71aa	Millicent is horrendous. The nickname Millie is cute though.|`|pLcUFBl2aa	Millicent is super cute when the nickname is Millie! I like Clover and Cassandra too!?|`|GZRHJBT7aa	I love Anabelle for a girl & Caden for a boy.

Out of your big list, personally I would choose Naomi Jasmine or Romany Willow, Isaac Harry or Aaron James!!    Hope this helps :)
aQ8o4w3Xaa	Yes, you can. Without knowing your cycle it will be hard to determine when you should take a test. I'd suggest just waiting maybe 3 weeks. Then take 3 on 3 separate days first thing in the morning. <br>  Yes, you can get pregnant from unprotected sex at all times. Obviously, there are days which the chances are much higher. The week prior to beginning your period is probably the highest chance. The week after is the least, but like I said, there are no "safe times". <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  :)|`|sz5J9V6aaa	Of course, SHAYNE|`|91sbAzoaaa	yes it's possible to get pregnant if you didn't use protection<br>  yes some ppl get their period even though their prego<br>  wait until you miss a period and take a test, if  you don't miss a period but you get morning sickness, or sour breast, ect. go to the doctor <br>  there is a possibility of getting pregnant everytime you don't use protection... but it doen't mean you will get pregnant ...me and my husband where trying to have a baby and it took 6 months to get pregnant... but others get pregnant the first time(everyone is diffrent)<br>  here's the thing if u don't want baby have him strap up or get on the pill - but still those aren't 100% either so be careful|`|Vjem5OJhaa	If you are between puberty and menapause, and you have had sex (even protected), there is a chance you could be pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Take a pregnancy test or consult your doctor.|`|mr5BoOwZaa	If he ejaculated in you, then there is a high probability that you are pregnant. You can take it after the 26th.|`|ejelObdJaa	yea take a test as soon as possible if u dont get ur period by the 27th or so ;)

It sounds so fake. And being heaven backwards, that's just asking for trouble. I hate the name Nevaeh, if you can even call it a name. Ugh.    How is Kiara pronounced? Like Kierra or Kiarra?     Aubrey is actually a male name, and no cute spelling will ever change that.    I like both Jayden and Rylan.

a8c1ec2782f2cbb1944ac1b3fd537fa6aa	The only way to know for sure is to take a HPT, there's a chance you could be as your period is late. What are you waiting for, test now!! Baby dust to you ;) x|`|eRlNQxbNaa	Actually increased discharge COULD be a first sign of pregnancy.  Girl, your period is already late, what are you waiting for?  Take a test!! :) You should be able to get a good result at this point in time.  I hope you are pregnant.  Let us know!|`|4UhSsISBaa	did you have sex?  if not, no. ...|`|eV5E9MhUaa	Yes... that's a very big sign. For me at least. You should go to the Dr. and get a blood test. What is ttc?|`|ayiCDGhNaa	you could be, i would wait 2 more days then take a pregnancy test. screw the old wives tales, have pregnancy test/doctor tell you. if so Congratulations!!!|`|5031cb559a6c3c75778b421b4a8a73e5aa	Yes, you could be. I got the same thing when I was pregnant and by my third child I knew I was pregnant by that alone. It could just be your period coming though.|`|FakmKM71aa	it's too early to know, wait a few days, and if u notice any other symptoms you should take a home pregnancy test and then go to your doctor to confirm it.|`|9QyrW2iCaa	White and creamy discharge is not known to be a sign of pregnancy.  Take a urine pregnancy test first thing tomorrow morning.  Good luck in your attempts to conceive.  : )
seU9VwIJaa	You may have to have another shot after you deliver if the baby is RH+. Everything will be fine though!|`|XE45S6OTaa	You don`t have to worry about the fact you haven`t had the shot yet.  If you have any spotting though, you will need the shot.  You and your baby will be perfectly fine once you get the shot.  You`ll have a tender spot, but other than that, there is no negative from getting this shot.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	Yes. It's an immunoglobin shot that tells your immune system that the different RH factor in the baby is not foreign and won't attack it. My wife just had her standard one at 28 weeks. Its very routine.|`|AA11981363	yes, you and the baby will be fine. Medicine nowadays is pretty amazing, your ob/gyn will take steps/measures to have you and the baby healthy.|`|CuCrGDuRaa	I am Rh negative too.  All you need is a shot of Rhogam and then you have nothing to worry about.  The shot keeps your body from making antibodies that will attack your baby at birth or a future pregnancy.  You will be fine.|`|He1sIjeyaa	I am also RH negative.  its not as scary as they make it seem at first so don't freak out.  all it means is that your blood and your baby's blood are more than likely not compatible. there is no real risk to your baby unless you have an invasive procedure done like amniocentisis...which they won't do because youre rh neg.... its more of a risk to a second baby...but not your first.  once you give birth thats when your two bloods will mix and your body will start to make anitbodies to your babies blood which will affect the next baby... but the shot they give you is just a quick shot called Rogham...its done in your hip and its no more painful than any other shot...then they'll give you another one right after you give birth so that your body wont fight off another pregnancy.|`|AR683Nz6aa	im RH negative and ive had the anti d jab aswell. both will be fine, its stops your body producing anti bodies that attack forgien blood cells, and protects you with future pregnancies. good luck
EHY3FnAmaa	yes.      how cute he is playing peek a boo lol|`|okp0CMc3aa	i never understood this milestone either, my daughter clasped her hands together not long after she was born. Whenever she was hungry, she would wring her hands together.|`|spwARELEaa	Love how he's peeking through his arms hehe :-)  I would def say this is "bringing hands together".|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	I would say YES!! congrats|`|5BNGu0Mkaa	My almost three month old does the same thing but she has been doing it for a while.  I'm not sure if its a 3 month old skill or not.  But I'm pretty sure its considered that.|`|0zkCGlNUaa	Yes. I would defiantly say that is bringing hands together.   My triplets do the same thing =]    Adorable picture by the way!!!|`|WlU3NFu6aa	totally! adorable!   congrats mom!|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	yes his hands are together (not to be sarcastic)|`|r5R2nstRaa	cute pic! i'd say so!|`|HSe6n5Tlaa	I would consider that bringing hands together, but I don't know where you read that that is advanced at 3 months old!  I have pictures of my kids doing that in the hospital when they were born! And they did it daily after that.|`|3NyM1cq5aa	Adorable!  Yes, I would say this counts!
smsUZG4Iaa	A female is born with as many as 2 million follicles, each of which holds an immature egg. That number is greatly reduced to 300,000-400,000 by the time the girl reaches puberty. Only around 400 follicles ever mature, since a woman produces only 1 egg each month, during her reproductive years.<br>  So, a woman is born with all of the eggs that she will ever have and they will deteriorate as she ages. The eggs will stop being released from their follicles when menopause is complete.<br>  Dont worry you have many to play with.. just try to relax. its hard to concieve when stressed|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	If you're concerned, ask your doctor if you can do an ovarian reserve test. You are probably fine, the other answers are correct, you are born with far more eggs than you need. I was 36 when I did fertility treatments, and if I had been on Clomid for more than three months I would have done a reserve test, to make sure that we weren't going through them too quickly. Bring it up to your doctor, and see what he/she says.|`|vue9NOhYaa	You are born with WAY more eggs than you will ever use, even if you have fertility treatments and hyperstimulate some months.|`|WIEPISyeaa	By the time women reach puberty, they have around 300,000 eggs.  Without fertility drugs that means women lose one a month (or 12 a year).  That means that even losing 10-15 eggs a month you have PLENTY of eggs. :)  <br>  <br>  Baby dust!!!
tXeqSv5Qaa	what 9 years old you got a problem or your lying get help|`|bnwS8X9yaa	Your kidding,,,,,,, right? If your not well then, you should go to a doctor for yourself.

It has to be.. do have a baby that you are breast feeding, and the 9 year old is doing it as well? Anyway..if you are seriously breast feeding a 9 year old i think you have deeper issues than getting him off of your breast! If not and it's a 9 month old then do what my sister did and bottle feed/ baby cereals..he/she will get used it.|`|0yLrQUdsaa	your 9 year old is still getting breast fed by you.  jesus. no idea.|`|QNGzjvRKaa	Um...I think you waited a little too long to ask that question here.    Maybe just keep your shirt on ??|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Do you mean 9 MONTH old?  Just switch to formula.  They need formula or breast milk until they are 1 year old.  Just DON'T breast feed.  The baby will still eat- as soon as he or she figures out that he/she isn't getting the breast mild any more they will take the formula.   If you actually meant 9 YEAR old, then you are a troll.|`|pdzfq7ojaa	Ouch!  That must kill.  Tell her that a nine-year-old should not still be breastfeeding.  It's just not right.  Just don't do it anymore.  She can eat on her own.  Just stop. You don't have to wean her off like a baby.  She's 9 years old, for goodness' sake!    To everyone else answering this question: this is most likely a joke, but there really are people in this situation, so you never know.    Edit: Oops, sorry.  I just realized you never said it was a girl.  I just assumed so because  a) that would be REALLY awkward for a boy, and  b) I saw something like this on YouTube, and it was two girls, so I just made an assumption.  Sorry.|`|SRIaRm08aa	this must be a joke.  You need a psychologist both you and your child if this is for real.  don't ask stupid useless questions.|`|eya1WDS4aa	9 year old.....what the heck? a nine year old shouldnt even be on breast...you have some issues.

I understand that you would like to keep your old friends as i'm sure you still have great fun with them doing other things .So why don't you try joining a club . You can still hang out with your friends but have other interests as well and trust me when you take a step back and look at things you'll be glad in the long run that you thought like this now.I know its stuff but I really think you sound like a normal 16year old and have a good head on your shoulders|`|PS83gPGoaa	lol u sound jus like me. wen ur out talk to different people expand ur group and then u keep every1 happy. also by doing this you get the best from both worlds; going out with old mates, doing new things with new mates|`|v05RzzCEaa	obviously these friends arent good for you so just remember the memories you used to have with them and then move onto new friends!|`|sKmQVwQMaa	get new friends|`|EHY3FnAmaa	who cares if you lose your friends?  honestly you need to turn your life around for the better.   there has to be some decent kids at your school to be friends with, give it a try for yourself!|`|hhtrayA3aa	just do what youur heart tells you.|`|09xCfB9Faa	Dont get involvd in it if you aint the one who has been involved in the drama then u shouldnt sort it out, or jus go out with different group of friends. cant you tell them that they piss u off wen they do it or stick to one other person who dont like it either n when the drama starts happenin leave with one person to go home! If they were your true friends they would understand and not make your life miserable!!|`|QGP930C6aa	yer i know what you mean (kinda) i' m one of the ones though that still do sllepovers and shoppin and one of my old mates made friends with a new crowd an gets pissed most weekends and has alot of drama in her life and only hangs out with us when her other friends aren't around.     but yer i'm glad i stayed with my lot and i wish i could help but you can still see your mates you hang out wiv now you'll just have people that you can hang out with doin the things you like to do     good luck wiv everything :)|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	Get a bf and go find normal friends. lol just kidding my head is running out of good advice though|`|cqW3NhqVaa	MAYBE YOU SHOULDNT BE DRINKING AT 16.  IF YOU WISHED YOU HAD DIFFERENT FRIENDS, GO   OUT AND MAKE SOME. IF YOURE TOO SCARED TO MAKE  NEW FRIENDS, QUIT BEING A BABY AND DO WHATS BEST  FOR YOU.    YOU SOUND LIKE THOSE KIDS ON MAURY. PATHETIC.|`|1tkFGhU6aa	dont drink, u'll always find new friend as long as u're doing the right thing for urself, u dont have to do all this nonsense just to proove something to others and in notime u're life is gone, u're pregnant and a single mom, study and get a job and do what u feel is good for only u, and there are always better people waitin to be a friend with the better u, being sick and crying, with mornings like hell is an ill way to start ur life, what u do now counts, start well,  best of luck|`|49LiABmvaa	don't listen to these people who say "obviously go get new friends"  they obviously don't remember what it's like to be a teenager - things aren't that simple anymore like they were back in the day  i see you're situation - you don't like what your friends do but you're afraid if you try to make new friends that your friends will get mad at you and you've been friends with them for too long and don't want that to happen  my advice is make new friends but also still hang out with your old friends  hang out with the old ones during the day because im sure they won't drink in broad day light  then hang out with you new friends at night and you won't have to worry about drunkies  good luck =]|`|FIALhwlKaa	Nobody tells you to drink that much at this age. If you dont like it, stay at home or look for a job. So you can get out of the way of those dramas. A good side effect for working is... you could save the money and go on a trip. I can tell you, youll loose the most of your so called friends anyway. If you want to change your life style, you have to look for people who behave like you want to behave yourself. There is nothing to be afraid of... only the stupidity of your friends by drinking, maybe driving drunk or doing stupid things ( like you wrote ). Do you want to wake up one morning in jail or as an alcoholic?  I dont think so... so change it now. If you dont know what you want, stay at home and make a pro and contra list of going on like that or not.|`|n3h9Byhpaa	Yeah, I'd definitely try it! Make some new friends and hang out with them on weekends and stuff. Have fun the ways they do, because there's plenty of ways to have fun without drinking and drugs.    Good luck!|`|yUgg0lPjaa	Its kinda the other way  round with me..   im 16 too and all my friends are like "goody-goodys" there not nerds but there agains smoking and drinking, in the summer we did loads of what you would call "fun" stuff like buying water slides and chiling and picknicking and stuff but tbh i really want friends that will go out with me and party and drink and smoke withough being frowned upon.   I guess everyone is different. Try mixing a bit more, dont ditch your friends just try mingle with a close crowd every nown again :)|`|WzKrZoHQaa	Are you in UK ?   There are heaps of things you can do.  Yes you are growing up and maturing - that's a great move foreward and you are now looking around and saying this is just not for me.  You have outgrown them - it happens even at the tender age of 48 !! We are all different and want different things, ppl move on in life and what once was acceptable is no longer acceptable.  WELL DONE for recognising you need to break away.  A Tip - but you know I bet you are not the only one to think like this in yr group but no one wants to be the first !!  Well someone has to be the alpha female - so why not you ?    You need to break away for your own dignity and respect.  Pls don't go out and do somehting REALLY stupid that can effect rest of yr life.  You have chance to do something about it, and right now.  Many have already crossed the line and wished they hadn't just because it seemed like a good idea at the time.    Thsi is yr moment to start breaking away.  Call CONNEXIONS & visit the website I provide below they are fabulous support for young 13-19 yr olds and they will also be able to point you in right direction for other organisations which offer support too.   There are others in South of England in Southampton "No Limits" help young from 11-25yrs so there are grps with chill out areas and siupport - you have fine opportunity to break away and thin about maybe college and training for a career and get paid for it with EMA - yes you get 30 for going to college and getting a skill, you even get help with transport costs and any uniform you may need too.   It is in yr hands Hun.  You have outgrown them but let them down gradually if you must - just don't be as readily available, you have coursework or something else to occupy yr time and then join a Tai Kwon Do group or badminton, basketball team and get away from them.  You will find the grp will break up anyway - just make sure yo udo it before any more risks are taken.      LIFE IS FULL OF CHOICES AND YOU HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE.    Each decision has a knock on effect so consider all consequences before youdo anything .  If in doubt write a line down middle of piece of A4 paper and write for and against - this will help to clear yr head of why should do or not do something.  But justby asking this question you know in yr heart you have sadly outgrown these friends - it just takes one and you could be doing the other's a favour in the long run too - possoble even saving odd one from pregnancy, sexual disease, rape, liver damage, alcoholic poisoning etc etc.   You need to start with yourself as you will not change them.  I wish you well.  Call connexions check out the site and take next step into adulthood.|`|zB2PIUmzaa	get new friends!
l4mMBe5Aaa	We love our high chair because it allows our daughter to sit at the table with us while we have dinner.  We have, on occasion, had picnics on the living room floor (with a blanket or towel underneath!) in her Bumbo seat with the tray attached.  I'd say as a temporary measure, it would be a fine choice.  <br>  <br>  OR, you could get one of these numbers: <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=8465713" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a> and use it both where you are now, AND in Texas - it wouldn't take up much room, and it connects to a regular chair so your child could sit at the table with you!  <br>  <br>  EDIT: My daughter has tipped the Bumbo seat over by leaning too far, so I would advise against sitting the Bumbo seat on a kitchen chair.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Sure, why not. We've used it from time to time up at my parents' house for snacks and such with Noah.<br>  <br>  I don't know if I'd use it for an older infant, though. Not sure how old your daughter will be while your husband is deployed but Noah is 10 and a half months and if I even tried to put him in his bumbo now he'd lean all the way over and make it difficult.<br>  <br>  We have the space saver high chair and it's great. Have you looked into the prices of shipping a high chair? I'm sure a bumbo seat would be fine to use, though, if you're really in a bind.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I used something like a bumbo seat for my son at first and I used it for a few months (actually, when he was very young I started feeding him baby food and rice cereal in his bouncer....it sat up higher and was easier for me to just sit on the floor). try it out for a while and it should be fine but once she is eating real foods with the rest of the family I'd get her a high chair.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I've never used a high chair to feed either of my kids.  Rarely I used a product similar to a bumbo with a tray with my first.<br>  <br>  Really though if they are old enough to eat then they are old enough to sit up unassisted.  So we have picnics on the floor or more often they eat sitting in my lap.  I also have a small table with chairs for when they are old enough to sit still, the chairs are small enough that if they fall off (which hasn't happened when they are actually sitting) its not a big deal)<br>  <br>  I find just putting a small table cloth on the floor works best to start, if you use a highchair the food is going to end up down there anyway.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	Honestly I loved the idea of the tray for the bumbo seat, but my 6 month old would almost flip the whole thing over when we were trying to feed him, he's so nosey when he would turn to see his brother or sister it would almost flip over. Temporary yes, but watch her really closely.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I have a high chair, but I go to my moms alot for supper because when my fiances gone it's just me and my son, so I don't see any since in cooking, so I just go there... and she has a bumbo seat for him... he's 13 months old and still fits in it... actually I have a 6 year old cousin that sits in it too... just for fun of course, but she actually fits! I didn't get the tray because I could never find one (all we have is a wal-mart here, so a trip to babies r us requires a whole day) We just put him in a chair on his own and slide him up to the table, and that works out great... the little table for the bumbo seat looks like it's really hard to keep on, and it looks like the baby could easily just take it off... I wouldn't invest in a high chair, just scoot the bumbo up to the table, of course watch your child because the older they get they will eventually learn how to get out of it, my son can't get out of his if he's scooted up to the table... but he can climb out of it any other time.|`|oZEPi0nuaa	I suggest a booster seat with the tray that attaches, it has two belts to strap it to a chair. It is fantastic for any age, and it is easy to carry somewhere with you, or pack to bring on a trip. It is sooo much safer then a bumbo. I know there is mixed feelings about them, but in the end they are really not safe to sit a baby it, unless it's on the floor. If a baby pushes with her feet, she could tip over. You can get the portable booster/highchair at toys R us. I love mine!|`|jNHbw3PMaa	i think you will be fine with the bumbo until it gets too small for the baby
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	My first baby was a c-section very similar to yours.  I dilated to 10, pushed for 2 hours, but she just wouldn't budge.  She wasn't completely sunny-side up, but she was facing my side.    My 2nd baby was an induced VBAC at almost 38 weeks due to mild pre-eclampsia.  It was a long labor, and I ended up getting an epidural (that I think ended up being part of my problem).  Right as I dilated to 10, baby's heart rate dropped, and they rushed me to the OR.  Thankfully, I was able to calm down, and baby's heartrate settled, too.  I delivered her flat on my back with help from a vacuum.  It was not a great vaginal delivery, and I did have an episiotomy and a painful recovery, but the birth was still amazing, and I was glad I'd done it.    With my 3rd, I had another induced delivery at almost 38 weeks due to pre-eclampsia.  This time, I had hired a doula, and she really helped me do what I wanted to during labor.  I wore my own clothes rather than the hospital gown (for my own comfort), and I even labored in the shower for 45 minutes that took me from 5cm-9cm after having been stalled at 4-5cm for several hours.  I did not get the epidural, and I was able to push on my own whenever I felt like I had to.  It was an amazing delivery, and I had only a tiny tear.  My recovery was phenomenal -- other than being tired and having some muscle soreness in my arms/back b/c of the positions I'd labored in, I felt really great!    I absolutely recommend a VBAC.  If you haven't already, check out www.spinningbabies.com to help get baby into a better position for delivery.  You also might want to consider hiring a doula and think about a natural birth as they can help make your VBAC more likely.    Good luck to you!|`|nLFr9csfaa	I did have a VBAC although my doctor really wanted me to have another c-section. I was stubborn because I felt like I was missing out on a beautiful experience. Well I went against my doctors wishes and had vaginal delivery. It was not a beautiful experience to say the least. If I could do it over again I would of had another c-section. I say this because my delivery was unbelivable painful plus I had to have the worst episiotomy. But I'm not sure if I got my epidural too early and it wore off or what, because it seemed as if I felt everything. I stayed longer in the hospital having one vaginal than c-section. On top of the episotomy it almost broke my tail bone. I couldn't walk for about 3 days. I was so sick that I could not hold my son to breast feed him. Had to let the nurses give him formula. But don't let my story scare you because every one else I know seems to have had a wonderful vaginal birth. Me on the other hand thought I was dying and had a son with a head shaped like gumby. That's because they of the suction thing they have to use to help extract the baby. Hope yours is better!!|`|KHZLPldraa	I wish.  Where I live at all the hospitals are once a c section always a c section, no VBACs allowed (insurance reasons) anyways so I am sheduled for my third and last in June.    I think it is great that you get to try and do a vbac though! CONGRATULATIONS!|`|txbZujeRaa	My girlfriend just did that and it was very successful.  I think she had trouble finding a doc who would do it though.
2oN7WrVKaa	Ahah, no its actually Unisex.<br>  Everyone thinks its a females name because the Disney classic, 'The Little Mermaid.'<br>  Theres a CD by a band named Kamelot, and it sort of follows a plot line. And the main character in the story is a man named Ariel.<br>  Shakespear used the name Ariel.<br>  Back in history, Ariel, was used as a boys name.<br>  So yes, its more of an old fashion type of name for a boy.<br>  <br>  I like Arielle for a girl, just because its different.<br>  It looks more feminine and attractive.<br>  <br>  Ariel for a boy.|`|eBKJRmEgaa	It's a unisex name.<br>  Traditionally, it is only used on boys - e.g. Ariel Sharon, a former (male) Prime Minister of Israel. The feminine would be Ariela.<br>  It is generally only seen on girls in English-speaking countries because of the Disney film, probably.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Unisex<br>  Ariel (ar-ee-elle)- Boy/Girl (My sister's friend's a girl and my mom's friend's son is a boy)<br>  <br>  Arielle (ar-ee-elle)- Girl (my summer camp)<br>  <br>  Ariella (ar-ee-elle-uh)- Girl (my friend)<br>  <br>  Arie- Boy (my grandpa)|`|IFDfpbFJaa	It sounds feminine.....could be just from the littler mermaid made it girly but I've never heard it on a guy nor would I ever name my boy Ariel.|`|Od73sfkxaa	It sounds feminine. If you are considering this name for a child, I would only name a girl that because of Disney's movie Ariel. The child would be harassed his whole life. My husband's birth name was Dana, and he was named after his father but the abuse (school, work, etc) was so severe that at 18 he legally changed his name to Daniel.<br>  <br>  However, I went to school with a girl named Ariel and it was a really beautiful name =) AND it was unique...!|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	It sounds feminine to me, I have thought about using this name, but I decided not to, it is cute, but reminds me of the word Aerial and too many kids can say Arielle the Airhead.|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I think it's a female name, I've heard Ari used for a guy, but never Ariel.

In modern American movies, it has been used for females.<br>  <br>  Check out the following link:<br>  <a href="http://www.mybaby-name.com/baby-name-full-detail/ariel/5150/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.mybaby-name.com/baby-name-ful...</a>|`|Gfj24Tb6aa	I know of one guy who has been named Ariel. And he was definitely NOT happy with his name. So I believe Ariel is a name for a female. I may be wrong, but regardless of what the book's describe 'Ariel' as, it definitely sounds feminine.|`|JmM8xCbLaa	Ariel is a girls names. It reminds me of the little mermaid, but it also reminds me of an aerial, like a television aerial. <br>  <br>  Arielle is lovely, but I would pronounce it like airy-elle, I think that sounds pretty, and different.|`|XZ8zBBpbaa	Haha.. didn't you ever watch the Little Mermaid? she's a girl!!<br>  <br>  Ariel.. no matter how you spell it... is a girls name.|`|AA11940306	Its a definite girl name....Arielle looks more feminine to me as well but both can be used I suppose..It sounds girly,trust me!|`|QS5QnHpbaa	It sounds pretty feminine.|`|PGiOSIBkaa	Female|`|WP36jh6Zaa	sounds feminine... Arielle has a unique spelling and sounds prettier.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	female only.|`|CacQW7rBaa	i think its feminine like ariel in the little mermaid|`|ZW1ohMP3aa	unisex, but id use Ariel for a boy and Arrielle for a girl.|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	I think it's a girl name and sounds girly. No I don't care for it.|`|NxAj44lFaa	ariel is female<br>  at least anyone i ever known with the name<br>  is a girl|`|ZCT2mKmaaa	its a female name|`|1f0e6416cfa85891b3ccda8816a22a1caa	IT IS UNISEX. I have a guy friend (he's Native American) named Ariel (before the movie came out).... and he got picked in elementary school like ohhh mermaid lol but in high school and on everyone thought he was really cool. So I mean girl or guy really it's not a bad option..<br>  <br>  And I would stick to Ariel , rather then Arielle. Everyone keeps picking confusing names where you have to think of all different spellings blahblahblah just keep it simple and your kid will be happy!|`|ftvxAS3saa	UNISEX<br>  <br>  I NEW A GUY NAMED ARIEL<br>  BUT THEN AGAIN HE WAS PRETTY FEM<br>  <br>  FEMALE

IyLp4Klwaa	I say tell your friend to go and see another doctor and to keep going untill they give her a blood test. Thats her best option plus to re test!|`|IBVWEzYzaa	I tend to skip a couple months about 1-2 xs per year so I think its normal.  Pregnancy tests are almost always right on unless she is only a couple wks prego.  Maybe she skipped due to stress. Ive heard that delays your periods.  opps. think I misunderstood that. Maybe its just too soon to show up if she is prego right now. strange...|`|4kX61Y97aa	it may be her hormone levels are low best thing is to go to the doctors that way she will know|`|fZgqzPSNaa	she could actually have a cyst on her ovary which causes women to not have their menstrual cycle. Has the doctor checked for these or has she had them before? There are very common in women. Hope the helps somewhat?
UiXJLrDWaa	sorry bout that you should have put coco butter lotion since day 1, cause im 33 weeks and thats what i did and i have not 1 stretch mark in my belly, try using coco butter that should help you. good luck!|`|vwuMTm7Saa	Time will make them lighter, but nothing will make them go away completely.   I'm putting money away for a tummy tuck in the future!|`|AA10186411	The only way to truly get rid of them is plastic surgery.  Otherwise they will always be there.  Stretch marks are hereditary, and no amount of lotion will prevent them if you are meant to get them.  They will definitely fade over time, and become just shiny, but they will always be there.|`|AA11981363	I know the feeling, I was a hot girl before I got pg LOL, then I got very bad stretch marks and used to be so upset about it. Then, after my baby was born I started doing everything I could to shed pg weight, also used some expensive products for stretch marks, and with time an dedication they have been dissapearing (fainting) and are not as noticeable now as they used to be. It doesn't matter though, once that baby is born you'll see everything has been well worth it.    Congrats|`|eRlNQxbNaa	Your skin is damaged and you won't make them go away.  They will fade with time.  I think you should be proud of them! Your body housed and nurtured another human being for nine months-that is soooo awesome!    I really liked almond oil.  I didn't get very many stretchmarks and I don't know if it was because of the almond oil or what but I heard it's good at helping them lessen in appearance afterwards.    Good luck and congrats!|`|82niQjyCaa	I have had three kids and i swear by bio oil it is not the cheapest of products but my stretch marks have virtually gone and i have got back my confidence and am back to my normally bubbly self and feel more secure about my looks x  everything is worth the stretch marks though and i love being a yummy mummy as my hubby calls me x  congrats x  i could live with the stretchmarks but not without my baby x|`|em8A42Bqaa	They have lotion specifically for stretch marks.  I use it and I havent gotten any yet. (28 1/2 weeks)  It started to look like they were coming on my side and I bought it right away.

I would suggest waiting.  But that is just me, in the end it is your choice.|`|sKmQVwQMaa	i would tell them.  so they know not to have a kid at that age, and make the mistake like you did.|`|htSZsds7aa	Yes tell them, maybe use this time to expalin how this pregnancy will mess up your life. and try to teach them to save sex for marriage. You are a baby yourself, I hope you are well prepared to work hard at being a mother and raise this baby yourself..dont expect your mom to do it.  Good luck|`|glYQY52maa	i think you should tell them anyways they are goin to notice soon.  and wow your so young but goodluck with the baby|`|JduQHocdaa	You probably should since it'll be obvious when you get bigger.|`|RvOilUZjaa	if you'd be OK with blab-mania, sure, tell them. if not, don't.  my experiance says that 10-13 year old girls cannot keep a secret.|`|mxixfE3Raa	Wow you're so brave taking on this responsibility, I wish you so much luck! x  I think you should tell them, they'll be so excited to know that they're going to be aunts!  I hope everything goes well for you :) x|`|zB2PIUmzaa	they will find out weather u tell them or not! so i would tell them now!|`|oDGpmkMaaa	My parents made my little sister(17) tell my younger brother (11) that she was pregnant.

I even tried to take him for ice cream and it didn't help. I think you should its always better comming from the person.|`|MHj1lFgOaa	You gonna need all the help you can get so tell your mom immediatelly and tell your sisters if you want.|`|iHykTY1Jaa	Do they tell secrets,if they do NO!!!  If they don`t yes you should.      P.S.who`s the farther...  lol|`|wohGR1Nkaa	you could and then you could explain how that they shouldnt do this however much of a gift it is they shouldnt do it themselves. And how some things are going to change.  :D
4Bgw5xs8aa	When she started to cry whenever anyone else held her. I know it's horrible and selfish, but it also kinda made me glow on the inside. lol.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	For the first few weeks I felt like there's no way this baby could be mine. Even tho I knew he was. Just didnt think I could make something so beautiful( even tho he gave me a rough way to go during labor lol). Bc he would just lay there and let anyone hold him for a little while. But then he was getting used to me getting up with him and rocking/singing him to sleep. Sometimes no one could settle him down and I would wrap him up and talk softly into his ear and he was be totally quiet even if he was hungry or not. But now that he's almost 9 months old and when I go to get him out of his crib every morning and say his name he instantly looks at me, smiles and gets all excited. This little boy has changed my life.|`|S8L983JBaa	Hi, I have a 6month old baby. Some people say that its when you hold them but for me it wasnt untill about 3months. The reason I felt like a mom was because I went into her room while she was crying and she looked up at me with her beautiful eyes which made me feel like she needed me. Thats when I felt like a mom to Gracelyn.|`|fMilDRgLaa	I understand how you feel.  It took awhile to "really" feel like a mom.  I would say when my baby got sick the first time and I felt scared even though it was a small fever.  Also, I think when they start recognizing you as their mommy.

I think because seeing him cry from being hurt made me upset and I realized I would do anything for him.    I don't know why it took me that long to feel it...guess it's just me.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I'm not sure, really. It'd be easy to say "Right away" but I think I was still in shock at that point. I mean, I fell in love with him right away but I didn't necessarily feel like his mommy yet.<br>  <br>  It was kind of an out of body experience the first month or so. Like I was "watching" somebody else's baby and they'd be over to pick him up soon. I think, just with time, I started to realize he truly was ours and wasn't going anywhere.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	My baby is 11 weeks as well, and I still don't quite feel like a mommy yet.  I agree with raisinet in that I feel like a student because everyone keeps telling me what to do with my baby.  I feel like I am in child development class in high school, and this is my homework.  I love my baby very much, and I can't imagine my life without her, but I still don't feel like her mommy just yet.<br>  <br>  <br>  Whats up with the thumbs down????|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter is 7 months old....and I'm not sure. I've always had such a desire to be a mom, and it feels so wonderful to know that I'm finally one, but I don't know when or if it's already hit me. I know that when my daughter falls asleep while nursing I think it's the most precious moment in all of the world, I treasure that.|`|n3IoftMFaa	When I walked into the living room and announced to my son and husband "This place is a disaster area!"<br>  <br>  Haha! My husband laughs and goes "Uh oh - mommy's mad at us!"<br>  <br>  It is kind of surreal, isn't it? It will come. I am a lot like my mom - despite all my best efforts as a teen!

Probably about 4 1/2 months.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	Even after 9 months of pregnancy and all of labor I still didn't feel like I actually produced a baby... I somehow thought that I went through all this work and then someone just handed me a baby, but I couldn't possibly have actually made one.<br>  <br>  Everybody laughed at me, but that is how I actually felt for awhile.  Even though I was 100% breastfeeding and being the mom, I still sometimes felt like I couldn't possibly have done this... it got better over time...<br>  <br>  But when I started taking my son to daycare at 10 weeks, it hit me like a brick.  He was my baby.  As soon as I knew somebody else was caring for him, I got the "itch."  Don't do anything wrong to MY baby.  Don't ignore MY crying baby.  Please keep MY baby happy all day, etc.  It was about that time that he started to prefer mommy and daddy and didn't want anyone else.  So that solidified all my motherhood feelings.<br>  <br>  Sounds crazy, but that is the truth.  :)|`|XOtOMncwaa	My son 13 months old, and sometimes I still feel like a full time nanny... it's still so unreal to me that I created this little boy and he's mine! Sometimes I still feel weird when I say the words "my son" and when my fiancee or my in laws or mom and dad call me "mommy" I still think it's kind of strange... <br>  Sometimes I do have moments where I'm like "wow I'm such a mom" like when I went out with my friends for the first time in years, they were all dancing and having a good time, and here I am in the corner calling and checking on my son, that's when it really hit me. <br>  I think it will always be strange, and I think it takes a long time to get used to the fact that you are a mom. I still haven't yet, but I do know that it's the best feeling in the world when your baby says "mama" for the first time!|`|UghJ0XROaa	I have two kids, a two year old and a 4 month old, i honestly felt like a mom for the first time 3 months ago.

claUGpVRaa	I don't think you will be sorry.<br>  There is a new grant available to all pregnant women however of a one off payment of ￡190 for a 'health in pregnancy' grant. It is only for babies due on or after April 6th this year though (I am due next week so typically I don't qualify!)<br>  Go to www.direct.gov.uk/money4mum2be<br>  <br>  It will tell you all about it. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Also, a tip I have found useful - Asda and Matalan for baby clothes and bedding/linen etc, and then for all other things you need to buy try amazon to compare prices after looking at the regular stores. I have found so many bargains that way whilst buying things ready for my baby.|`|uP08b6K4aa	The link below should give you all the information you need.<br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|E6obQSpraa	No you wont qualify unless you are on benefits or getting child tax credit already with the disability premium.|`|86PuYgDJaa	Probably not... people like us who work hard don't get anything from the government... if you were on benefits you would get everything you wanted!|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	no unless you are claiming benefit you don't qualify for the maternity grant sorry
jLYTKr33aa	My son was just beginning to crawl at that age.  He could pull up to a standing and walk with his hands held, but would not cruise along furniture just yet.  He was saying a few words, used several baby signs, and rolled a ball back and forth.  I don't know what "stage" food he was on, since I made all of his food at home.  He was starting to like lumpy foods, especially firm tofu.  He was drinking water from his sippy cup; he never had a bottle, as he was breast fed.  He had no teeth at 7 months old; he got his first at 8 months.  Most importantly, he was a happy, healthy baby boy.    Enjoy your little guy - it goes by way too quickly.|`|DPegPYRPaa	My daughter was the same way. She didn't really crawl until almost 9 months old. She would sit up, play, smile, rool over, keep herself busy, but crawling she would not do. Friends babies were crawling at 4-5 months. But she did it soon enough and then before I knew it she was walking at 11 months. She also got teeth late, I think at 8 months. I don't think you have anything to worry about but if you are concerned enough, ask your pediatrician.
e88d2d2d98ed34d4a785a69b0406b4acaa	two and a half is pretty young for boys to potty train, so congrats on getting the peeing part accomplished already!    I think you're on the right track with offering rewards. Of course keep trying to watch for "the face" when he's about to go, and joyfully whisking him onto the potty to drop his load.    also, when you change his poopy accidents, maybe you could put his poops into the potty, to show him that's where you want them to be.  The visual cue might help.    Besides potty training my two kids, I've also litterbox trained bunnies and paper-trained puppies, and they are a lot less smart than a two year old. I take their "accidents' and move them onto the paper/litterbox everytime until one day, poof, they start putting them there by themselves and promptly earn a little treat. (lettuce for bunnies, Snausages for puppies.) Ice cream is a good idea for toddlers, but remember, he's gonna' want that ice cream every time he succeeds! Maybe try something smaller, like a fruit snack (the kind that are soft and safe for toddlers.) That way you can keep the rewards close at hand even if you're not at home.    good luck!|`|AA11795652	If you are home, take away the underwear and let him run naked.  He won't have the security of his underwear holding in his poo so he'll be forced to use the toilet.  Worked for me.|`|hE2gRG18aa	ok look im not sure wat you should do but tell him if he has to go poop to make a sign or to tell you......and im going to have a baby sister in may so im still learning about the feeding and the diaper changing and the potty traing ......so good luck hope wat i said helps. OH AND I ALMOST FORGOT WATCH HIM FOR SIGNS THAT HE HAS TO GO.....OK?|`|oDyNiJi7aa	This is a common problem.  This is going to sound weird but when it comes to pooping it is as if they are loosing a piece of them. This is one thing they can control and when he is ok with it he will do it!  I had the same problem with my son and he is now a teen.  My 3 year old however did great.  When your child does it make a big deal out of it and give him a ton of praises.  I wish you the best of luck!|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	My son Liam is 2 and he started with just pee. He didn't like how it felt when he pooped on the potty. We did stickers, for pee and rewards for poop like [going out for lunch, going to the park etc.] he loved that!!|`|9DQjfmFvaa	Is there a certain time of the day he will go poop.  My daughter goes poop in the morning and once in the afternoon at a certain time.  See if you can catch the poop when you notice what time he usually goes poop.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	For some reason boys are just harder to train when it comes to pooping.  Hang in there, it'll happen.  Be consistent w/rewards.  If he does it in his pants, let him flush it away.  Maybe that will help.  My 1st son didn't fully train until 3 1/2.  My 2nd son at 2 1/2.  It'll happen, promise.
eRlNQxbNaa	I felt crampy for a month before my period came back! I for sure thought I was pregnant again.    You can still ovulate without expecting a period though, so it's best to check.  My guess would be that your system is getting back on track and that's causing a bit of cramping.  :)|`|01vMpHkWaa	pull out method isnt being careful    i should no|`|fPAlfokHaa	It is possible to get pregnant even though you haven't yet started getting your periods again you never know when you'll start ovulating again..which happens before your period obviously.
ctra63V6aa	The percentage effaced and the cm reading are two separate things.  Effaced means how thin your cervix gets. When it is 100% effaced, it is open.  The cm refers to how big the opening gets. It starts at 0 and gets to a 10, which is when you're ready to push. So, at 1.6cm, you are 16% of the way.  Hope that helps!|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	actually i thought effacement was the level (in percentages) above or below the "0 point" in your pelvis your babies head is, and the CM is the amount the cervix has dialated? I was always told by the dr with my wife they are two completely different things... maybe go hand in hand, but not exactly the same thing? maybe someone can correct me?|`|3EhoJ42zaa	You have to be 10 cm and 100% effaced to deliver.  So your 1.6cm (basically 1cm) then you still have 9cm to go.  Did your doctor give you a percentage at all?  If he did then that is how much effaced you are.|`|AA11981363	it's very hard to say, only your ob doing a pelvic exam can tell you how effaced you are. If you are almost 2cm dilated you could be 20-30-40% effaced, there is no way to really know. Dilating & effacing go hand by hand.
IFDfpbFJaa	No, it's not bad to sleep on your stomach that early. Sleep anyway you can right now. After you start getting bigger people say it's better to sleep on your left side. There is the vena cava that the baby can lay on and cut off blood flow, you have more organs on your right side to squish, so if you lay on your left the baby is only pressing on the intestines.  But just sleep how ever you're comfortable. Get a body pillow too, those are super comfy when you're pregnant belly is in the way|`|d76b933acafc2fee8fc3c072d2e15141aa	it is recommended to sleep on your left side so that there is more bloodflow to the uterus.<br>  later in pregnancy they do not advise you to sleep on your back|`|3hUR2SQ9aa	It won't hurt the baby, you can sleep on your stomach until you are to uncomfortable to do so.<br>  There's quite a bit of cushion in there to get baby safe.|`|6VZGYCZcaa	It is not dangerous to sleep on your stomach at first but once you start getting bigger it is recommended to sleep on your left side so that there is more bloodflow to the uterus.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	I am 12 weeks and still sleep on my tummy sometimes.  I heard that once you start feeling uncomfortable is when you shouldn't.|`|paHbLR9aaa	I slept on my tummy until it was no longer comfortable!  It won't hurt the baby to sleep on your tummy.|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	I'm about 8 weeks pregnant and have a 17 month old... last time around my doctor said it was fine to sleep on my belly as long as it was comfortable (once you start showing it'll be so awkward you won't be able to). Throughout the first trimester in general most any sleep position is safe. Once you get into the second trimester (some say closer to 16-20 weeks, but I go with 12 to be safe), I'd be more conscious of not sleeping flat on your back because of the possibility of cutting off circulation to the vena cava. At the end of my pregnancy, no position except my back was comfortable, so I slept propped up with lots of pillows so I was more in a sitting up position. Some doctors also recommend only sleeping on your left side, which keeps the uterus from putting pressure on your liver etc.<br>  <br>  Tummy sleeping isn't dangerous at 9 weeks though, you're fine :-)

kZRTekoJaa	it really depends on how long she can stay..  but generally speaking, i'd recommend a week before your due date.  my sister lives about 10 hours from me as well, and she stayed with me for like a month when i had both of my kids. she arrived about a week before each were due. of course, both of my kids were born 3 days before their due date so it worked out well for us.  on the other hand my sister's last baby born was actually "late"- born about 10 days past her due date. so me and my mom didn't get to stay as long as we'd have liked after the baby was born since we hadn't planned on her being ten days late and had been there since about a week before her due date.  so whatever you decide, just try to be flexible and maybe have a back-up plan incase the baby is late or early.  congrats on the pregnancy, and good luck with baby! :)|`|85PmFNp3aa	I would want my mom there two weeks, so she can help get everything ready, and let you REST for the LAST time in a LONG time. Since you are a first time mother, usually in labor longer- like 10 hours or more (usually, more) sorry, don't want to scare you. In my experience, my first was born a day late, they induced me because I lived two hours from the hospital, and I was slightly dilated on his due date.They didn't want to send me home, and have me return, so we opted for induction. They took me in on Oct 31st, told me to rest, and they would induce labor in the morning.They started the Pitocin at 8 am, and my son was born at 4:30 that afternoon.. They say induction goes a lot faster than natural labor.My second came two weeks early, and I was in what they call "false labor" for two weeks before. When she came, I was only in "hard labor" for 4 hours. She was FAST! I would get people there early, but only for my own selfishness- I love company!It's a great chance to have some extra time with them.Congratulations!|`|AA10980961	1 week sounds good.

145RUNQHaa	Has she got a cup aswell?if so then thats good but i m not suggesting take the bottle away.does she have a bottle while on your knee before bed or is it a special comfort to her?then let her have it i don t know what the big deal is with bottles they re just a container to drink out of!just avoid putting anything too sweet in it.18 months sound fine but it doesn t make you a bad parent if your child has a bottle beyond that age many older toddlers enjoy a bottle and a cuddle on mum or dads knee it can be a special bonding experiences.i m sure people will disagree with me but it s just my opinion.x|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Everyone has there own opinion w/this.  Too early, I believe is not good.  I'd rather they wait until after 18 mos.  However, you can taper off after a yr.  Try giving  bottle just at nap and bedtime, then eventually just before bedtime, finally none.|`|AA10186411	I think you should at least eliminate it during the day.  My daughter is 16 months and drinks a sippy cup during the day, and only has a bottle at night.  I plan to get rid of that bottle at 18 months.|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	Start convincing her that the bottle is bad and get her a new, 'Sip Cup'. No one ever became like Bernard Madoff because they were taken off the bottle too soon.|`|ovgxECKsaa	If your daughter is showing interest in drinking from a cup (such as trying to get a sip of whatever you are drinking), now is a good time to start the transition from bottle to cup.  Both of my boys were totally off bottles by one year, my daughter by 16 months.  Different children accept the cup at different ages.  Next time you give her juice in between meals, put it in a sippy cup and see what happens.  You'll have to guide her the first few times because she will still try to turn it up and suck it like a bottle.  Don't panic if she makes a big mess and is more interested in playing with the cup than drinking from it.  Let her discover how the cup works in a relaxed setting.  She'll accept it more readily if she feels like it is a fun time (she'll take her mood cues from you) and can explore the cup almost as if it is a new toy.  Within reason, there is no right or wrong time to take the bottle away.  Just make it exciting and fun for your child and she'll be more than happy to try new things as they come along.  Good Luck!|`|m7lga8jOaa	Hi, I am a mother of a nearly three year old and do not believe that I do everything right, but I do believe that no one knows a baby like its mother.  Listen to the advice but take it with a pinch of salt, if you need to wait a bit don't stress, but if your little one is ready then go for it.  I followed some rules and broke others or at least bent them and my son is just fine.  Have fun!|`|eya1WDS4aa	Most dr.s recommend there first birthday. I did it and my son did great. I juts switched him to a sippy cup never had a problem.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	Most pediatricians recommend that you wean from the bottle at 1 year.  I'd start now working with your daughter to drink from a sippy cup.    If you do give your daughter a bottle (or a sippy cup) at night, make sure you brush her teeth afterwards before she goes to sleep.|`|ibeYAlwpaa	My daughter has been off the bottle since before she was a year old. I introduced her to a sippy cup at six months, the kind with the soft bottle like top. i think Nub makes them. But the transition is really easy when using the kind with the soft top because really she barely even realized she didnt have a bottle. After giving her that particular kind i started introducing the regular sippy cup with the plastic top. She still at 14 months uses both (kinds of sippys). But i defly think you should introduce her to sippy cup.|`|Z971opTYaa	By the time my son was 11 months old he was eating enough solids so therefore i was able to eliminate bottles very easily and give him a sippy instead..I never let him just have a bottle unless it was feeding time...First i took away the afternoon bottle and then a week later i took away the morning bottle and a week later i took away his bedtime bottle...He transitioned very well and by the time he was a year old he was completely off the bottle....I waited a month and i then took his pacifier...With that there were no tricks to it..I just put them up and about after a week of some serious craziness lol he was doing fine without it...So by 13 months he was off everything and on to a cup.. Just start taking them away but make sure your daughter is  getting enough food to replace her feedings and just keep giving her the cup..she will eventually get the hang of it..good luck|`|I4KE3KBjaa	I took my daughter off of the bottle at her 1st birthday. The longer you wait, the harder it will be. Believe me, mine is 2 and still has her pacifier at night!|`|oDyNiJi7aa	This is a personal choice. One thing you have to remember is that the longer they are on the bottle it can have a bad effect on there teeth. If I were you I would start with a sippy cup at one of the meals, then the next day replace it for 2 and so on and so furth.  Then before you know it the child is off the bottle!  Best of luck!  Mom of 3 and 1 step daughter.
G2auAv1Saa	What the school teaches is not always what the parent wants them to learn. These discussions should not be allowed in school as it doesn't relate to reading/writing/math/science or history.     I would support mine 100% if they wanted to take a chasity pledge and kudos to you for your abstinence decision.|`|UUpsa35Daa	Parents like their kids to know their opinions on the subject. And some parents would like to tell you more than the school does. It's not like it hurts you to talk to parents about it...you're here so obviously they know a thing or two.|`|jLYTKr33aa	Oh yes, the schools are doing such a wonderful job at teaching children about sex!  That's why there are so many "could I be pregnant" and "could he knock me up if I give him oral" questions on this site.    I knew a girl in high who firmly believed in abstinence.  She gave birth before graduation.  Some kids change their minds - that's why it's important for them to have the correct information.  Of course I would support my child if he took a chastity pledge.  That won't stop me from making sure he has the correct information about STD's and pregnancy, though.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	My children will be getting the sex talk from me when they are older.  I don't care how awkward it is. It is not the schools/teachers job to raise my child.  I would much rather my children hear the facts from me and atleast I will know they know ALL of the facts.  If they get the chance to take sex education in school that's fine too, they get to have the talk twice then.  And just so you know, children do not open up more to teachers when it comes to the sex talk.  Kids are too embarassed to ask questions infront of the entire classroom so they will not get the answers they need.  When I give the talk, my children will be very well educated in ALL aspects of sex.  I wont have to wonder "gee did they learn that in school?"  My children will know no matter how awkward something is, they can always come to me.|`|SKJb6eLKaa	My children can do whatever they want, but my daughter will be on birth control at 13.    I was 14 when I got pregnant with her.    My bestfriend is 14 and she is sexually active and due to the "age of consent" being raised from 14 to 16, the schools teach abtinance which doesn't always work and rarely do teenagers follow that statement. (I didn't!)    The sex talk you give your children should be about birth control and how to prevent pregnancy and STDs, Not to do things they don't want to do, along with other things..   My mother did not give me the sex talk, and I am now 16 & I have 2 children under 2. And when I was 14, that was the age of consent so they taught it in schools, but they did NOT go in depth what so ever! (They said use condoms but never taught us how to use them, hence my daughters birth. My son was concieved via Broken condom.)    All children are different, some choose abstinence while some do not, and in which case you should inform and prepare your children for the physically and emotional changes that come with being a teenager and being sexually active or not sexually active.|`|s1zitZMOaa	Schools don't do a very good job with sex education and since it's something most parents a) have strong opinions about and b) know a good deal about (unlike science or math for example) we tend to want to discuss it with our children.     My parents talked to me about it because I had questions and I certainly felt more comfortable talking to my mother about sex than I would have talking to a teacher about those types of things. Kids tend to have different questions about sex at different times and parents are available at those times. The sex ed only happens once and kids are probably going to have questions beyond that.     If my child wants to take a personal chastity pledge that is her choice. I would not be in favor of her making a public declaration of such a thing or wearing virginity jewelry because I do not in any way believe that the status of your gentiles should be made public. It is a private matter. I also am well aware that virginity pledges and abstinence only education has been statistically shown to be ineffective.|`|eya1WDS4aa	most schools dont talk about SEX anymore. And apprently not to many parents talk to their kids about sex because if they did their wouldnt be some many 13-15 year olds getting pregnant. Why wouldnt parents talk to their kids about sex if it could prevent a teenage pregnancy.     For the second question if my child pledge chasity i would support them 100 precent.|`|uoPG3Y0saa	because they care about their kids and they want their kids to hear it from them and not some misinformed kid.      you might not realize it now, but the reason you have good values is because your mom cares about you enough to teach you about what's right and what's not.  which you are lucky for, even if it can be "weird."  not all parents pay attention to their kids, and those are the kids running around getting pregnant at age 15.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	Believe it or not, some kids would rather talk to their parents about this stuff than to a teacher. They'd probably rather talk to their friends about it than their parents, but at least I know that when my daughter talks to her friends, she knows what she is talking about.  And yes, if my daughter wanted to take a chastity pledge I would support her.|`|nopHdd9Kaa	I think it depends on the parents.  If I had the talk with my mother that you did with yours I would feel the same way, but I appreciated having "The Talk" with my mother and hope to have it with my children.  I found that what I was taught at school was not as complete as I would have liked it to be and now a days with more and more schools teaching abstinence only I feel that it is important for children to learn that yes, abstinence is the best way to avoid pregnancy but there are ways to be safe if you choose to have sex.      My mother was very open with me and our "Talk" started with the basics, don't have sex until you are ready, and when you are do it safely. By the time I was 16 we had a very open relationship that I was able to ask her any sex related thing no matter how awkward it made either one of us. For instance, I know her history and how she was one of those poor girls that lose it to the guy that they thought loved them and really he just wanted sex and as soon as he got that he was done with her.    *extra question answer- I would fully support my child in it and would make sure that I was available for them to talk to if they started to have doubts about it or just needed affirmation that they are doing the right thing.    For the record: My sister is married and has a daughter and I am almost positive that my father is still convinced that she has never had sex.  Which probably explains why he has never had that active of a part in "The talk".|`|9LWuWHiMaa	Okay hon, i am a mom. i am also a christian and my home is a christian home so when i give the talk i do not want my child to be misinformed about sex. sex comes with responsibilities that young, single and unmarried children are just not ready for. i want to clarify the myths and misconceptions that are out their.   it also is my responsibility as a parent to teach my child about sex. that includes the changes in the body, how to care for the body and abstaining.   i teach my child about the STD's and unplanned pregnancy. i teach them how sex tends to make a relationship more complicated that it needs to be. you believe you love a guy and when you grow up you realize it was all sex because that guy never loved you.   i teach them what love is and explain the difference Between love and infatuation.  so as you can see my sex talks are more like sex education and i believe i am the best person to teach this. i was very open with my child so he had no reason to feel awkward cause he sees love in his home.   i tell him never let sex trick you into believing it is love.  yes but as long as he knows that it is about keeping his body pure and being obedient to the will of god. such a oath i would encourage him to keep with god.
Z7V7AbBQaa	My son is not on a nebulizer normally but has been admitted to the hospital twice for 3 and 4 days with breathe treatments ever 3 hours plus going to the ER about 5 times for breathing treatments.  My son hates it and screams the whole time the Respiratory therapist  at the hospital says it's better if they cry because the medication is drawn deeper in to the lungs so it more affective but if he didn't cry it's ok.      What  worked best for us was if able was put a movie on and sit my son on my left leg (so his right side was next to me) with his right arm under my left arm kind  of behind my back then with my left hand I held his left hand so his head was kind if on the inside of my elbow  so it's hard for him to turn his head while I hold the mask in my right hand. some times my son would watch the movie some times he would scream like he was being murdered I just kept telling him he was ok and how good he is and he's being a big boy  and that this will help him breath better and sang to him.   I do the same thing with is inhalers he used daily.    I hope you daughter doesn't have to stay using the nubulizer for very long.|`|z4byzsGLaa	My son was about that age and it took 2 of us each time such a pain!  One would hold him and the tube to his face and the other would do anything and everything to keep him occupied!!  Feel your pain!!  Good luck hope she feels better!!|`|8DnIXwnyaa	we give his treatment whilr he is sitting in the high chair|`|ibWLdXlJaa	My son is 8 months and on one right now to. He did a lot better at the hospital than he did at home. At first he would cry but I hold him and let him play with a toy or the tubes from the nebulizer and he does pretty good now. He loves to put anything he can in his mouth so he chews on it to. He likes to hold it before we start to. That helped him quite a bit. Good luck I know this is not a fun time for you but if it can be for her you'll be ok.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	The best way I got my son to use his was to put him in his car seat in front of the TV.  I know it sounds ridiculous but I would turn on something with bright colors and lots of singing and noise.  After a minute or so I would start up the machine and he would not even pay attention to the fact he was getting it.  Its worth a try.  GOod luck hun|`|S3WeYrVgaa	I have to hold my baby in my lap and sing a song to him (the apples and bananas song to be exact, any other songs and he will throw a fit, and I have to sing it the whole time).  I also pat his tummy (helps somehow) and kinda bounce him up and down a little bit.  I have to do all 3 of these things otherwise he throws fits.|`|q595MhH8aa	My daughther was on a neubulizer starting at about 5 months until about 9 months.  The best advice I can give is to be patient!! Turn on the TV and make sure you have some cartoons on, that helped her some.  It was funny, some days she would do great, others she didnt want anything to do with it.  She liked to play with it first before she got the treatment...you can try that too! Good luck!!!
AA11327039	Call the parents NOW and explain to them that she tripped over your foot and fell into the toy and that you are sure she will have a bruise.    Call the urgent care/emergency room and just ask about signs of a concussion. And keep an eye on her.    When they get to the day care explain what happened again and apologize.    Tell parents how baby reacted  Tell parents what you did to make baby feel better  Tell parents that she is currently showing/not showing signs of a concussion and that you called the er/hospital.  Call the parents  this evening and ask how the little tyke is doing and again apologize about the baby getting hurt.|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	I think you need to get on the phone with the parents right away! Nothing is worse than picking up your injured child without knowing before hand. This happened to me and I was so upset. Not because she was hurt but because no one told me before hand. I think I was more mad about that then the injury itself.    The reason why is because even though kids will be kids and stuff happens I want to have the chance to pick up my child if I choose to. Also, details start to get fussy if it happened at 10am and your trying to tell me what happened at 6pm.     A phone call shows that you are concerned about the parents feelings as welll as the welfare of the child. With my daughters old daycare the would call if anything would happen and I appreciated that. I never ever got mad because like I said stuff happens.|`|nbSp469Waa	Call her parents right now and let them know exactly what happened and what procedures you are taking to make sure she is okay.  Be sure to tell the that you are just making them aware of the situation.  My son use to get hurt all the time at his preschool, and I appreciated the fact that they would call me everytime, whether it was a scrapped knee or a bloody nose.  Even now that he is in school, they call us to let us know if there was an injury|`|AA10186411	I know at my daughter's daycare (a facility, not a home daycare) they are required by law to fill out a accident form, and explain to the parent what happened.  If it were my child, I would understand.  Children (especially those learning to walk) are always getting boo-boos, and I wouldn't be upset with you over it, unless it became a frequent problem.|`|Mx2hzWgTaa	you should have right away iced, and called the parents immediately, if it was my daughter id understand accidents happen.. after all as babies are they're not very stable on their feet. but some people have a different opinions.. but i suggest you call them right away|`|eeGN977eaa	I would wait until the parent comes to pick her up if she is okay. When the parent gets there just explain what happened. I think any reasonable parent would understand. My daughter gets bumps and bruises all the time whether at home or at daycare. If you call the parent at work she may think it is worse than it is and panic so I would wait until she is picked up unless it is really bad.|`|InZU5aaxaa	Follow first aid rules. Put ice or heat on the injury. If cut, clean properly and put band-aid on. Then call her parents and explain that there was a very minor accident, daughter is fine, and that you followed all first aid steps. Then explain what happened. What ever you do, never try to cover up. Always be honest and upfront.|`|5031cb559a6c3c75778b421b4a8a73e5aa	Call them immediately and let them know. I would want to know as soon as it happened.|`|XwPyne6Raa	I use to work at a large daycare and when a child got hurt we would call the parents and inform them so that they have the option to come check on their child if they wanted to.  Also, we had forms were we would put the details of the incident on paper then have the parents sign it when they picked up their child.  The paper was for CYA, it was our own proof that the parents were informed of the incident.|`|oDyNiJi7aa	I have done in home childcare before.  If I were you I would document what has happened and have the parents sign when they come for there child so it can't haunt you later. After you document what happened I would call the parents and inform them what has happened. The reason what I said to have the parent sign it and if you were ever to go to court over this you have proof.  You need to protect yourself, the child and your business as well.  I hope that this has helped you.  Also I would contact a lawyer to see what else you should do.  Take care and best wishes!

eV5E9MhUaa	There's absolutely NO way to tell if your baby has brain damage. You'll just have to wait until the baby is born. But then again, how will you know if you "developmentally" did anything? Every baby is different. Did you not know you weren't supposed to be in hot water?|`|AA12345219	What temperature was the hot tub? If it wasn't too hot, you wouldn't have to worry about it anyway. There isn't a lot you can do to check if everything is fine, but the main concern would be if your body temperature got so high that it could impact your baby, but if you weren't in there very long and it wasn't TOO hot, I bet the one time will be okay.|`|fPAlfokHaa	well the only reason it's advised to stay out of jacuzzis steam room etc is because it raises your body temp which is bad for the baby..i'd say things will be fine raise your concerns with your doctor and just avoid jacuzzis in future!
SEzIkGNiaa	Yes, there is such thing.  My little brother has them on his waist line.      A Mongolian Spot, Mongolian Fleck or Mongolian Blue Spot is a benign flat congenital birthmark with wavy borders and irregular shape, most common among East Asians and Turks, and named after Mongolians. It is also extremely prevalent among East Africans and Native Americans.[1][2] It normally disappears three to five years after birth and almost always by puberty.[3] The most common color is blue, although they can be blue-gray, blue-black or even deep brown.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	Im Mohawk  my kids have no bruises ..never heard of that birth mark EVER|`|YMcidP50aa	Both my boys have these mongolian marks as well and they are african american n creol so truley a lot of people have them. There nothing to be alarmed about as a matter a fact my youngest sons but is covered with the mark|`|G65M35Viaa	My 2 kids are half mexican and half white and they both had dark spots right around their tailbone (mongolian spots).  It is totally normal and almost all mixed race kids have them. They fade over time.|`|k0qTaSceaa	No it is definatly a Mongolian Blue spot, blue spots only come from Mongolian blood no Indian Or Mexican.  what kind of details? they fade over time. I bet the daughter is really young cause they should be gone around age 5 or atleast before age 5 i think my brothers was gone around age 3
FkGh0LuWaa	Contact a lawyer so the can sign the proper papers and then the niece can't come back and take them away from her in a few months.|`|5031cb559a6c3c75778b421b4a8a73e5aa	Your aunt should get it done legally so she can't play games when she feels like. This way your aunt is in control.
G2auAv1Saa	6 weeks PAID is very very generous. If your employer falls under the guidelines of FMLA you are allowed up to 12 weeks, this is unpaid of course.   http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fmla/|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if i am not mistaken i think u could use fmla; although you probably  won't get any money during that time, i believe you get up to 90 days a year....gl, hth....call your human resource dept and ask them about fmla....|`|aJLx0nhNaa	You can't extend your paid time.  Under federal law however, you are eligible for 12 weeks off, unpaid, for the birth of your child under the Family Medical Leave Act.  This only guarantees that your job will still be there when you return.  No pay is involved.  It's important to realize that those 12 weeks don't just add onto your six weeks making 18 total - they would run concurrent with your six weeks paid, making a total of 12, 6 paid, 6 not.|`|3NyM1cq5aa	Depending on where you work, you may qualify for short-term disability and get a portion of your wages.  You must use your paid time off first.  I received 60% of my wages for 8 weeks total following a c-section, but I had 4 weeks of paid time off accrued, so I received 4 weeks of pay at 60% my normal rate.  Does that make sense?  I don't know if it varies state-to-state or by your employer.  If you have a benefits coordinator where you work, ask him/her what the regulations are at your place of employment.  Take as much time off as you can!!  It is worth it.  I took 12 weeks (4 were totally unpaid) and it was completely worth.  Good luck, and congrats!|`|5DJcir9saa	In regards to wanting to spend as much time with your newborn as possible, I understand where you're coming from.  I was in a similar situation, so what I had to do was save money in advance for the extra time off.  When I found out I was pregnant I started a savings account and put money aside out of each of my paychecks.  Now I have heard that some states have maternity leave for their residents, but I'm not sure if California is one of them.  Hop on your state's website and check it out.  If you do take extra time off, make sure your employer is aware of your plan.  The Family Medical Leave Act has guidelines as to what employers have to follow it.  So if you work for a small employer, you may not be covered under that so you'd want to make sure that your employer is ok with you taking the extra time off.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Its inhumane but I believe that is just the way it is.  You can take the 12 weeks but other than your vacation pay and the 6 weeks paid you're screwed.    I'm in Canada we get 50 weeks of paid leave and between mom and dad you can take 85 weeks of job protected, but not necessarily paid, leave.|`|MPavjXO6aa	So let me get this straight...you want to spend more time and have your employer pay you for staying home to care for a child on a decision you and your partner made...hmmm    Take your 6 weeks of vacation and hope that your coworkers don't despise you for already shifting your work load to them.    Since you live in California, maybe you might care to pass this on to the other minions who want to bankrupt your state. Thank God I left there.|`|PR42HDjraa	Jesus Christ in Europe a woman can get a year of paid leave!!! 6 weeks is so not enough, especially if you get the after birth depression! Jesus Christ, you'd have to go back just as soon as you pop the kid out!|`|OtbbKdITaa	I think "Former Recruiter" must be a man. The US has the WORST pregnancy rights for women. Women in China and Canada get one year off work for maternity leave.    FMLA - make it work for you!     Enjoy the time you spend with your new bundle of joy!|`|2LflHv23aa	I live in California and this is what you can do to maximize your stay home. You are entitled up to 16 weeks off total. Your employer has to keep your job. You can take up to 4 weeks prior to delivery and 12 weeks off after, that is what I did. If you have vacation you can use that. Disability will pay you from 36 weeks of pregnancy to 6 weeks post par tum for a vaginal delivery and 8 weeks post par tum for a c section. After your 6 weeks you can take paid family leave for 6 weeks. The pay is less than you get now but it is something. If you decide to take only 2 weeks prior to delivery you can take those 2 weeks later and use vacation time. You can not exceed 16 weeks though and keep your job.   If you have more questions about pregnancy leave in California e mail me. I have spoken to the labor bored multiple times about this stuff.|`|bc9inzicaa	Here is what I know:    State Disability Insurance provides financial assistance for four weeks before and six weeks after (eight if you have a c-section) the birth of your child.  The amount SDI pay depends on a calculation based on your last four quarterly earnings.      FMLA does not provide any financial assistance, only job protection, for twelve weeks; however, the twelve weeks run concurrently with the SDI program.      The State does provides 6 weeks of financial assistance through the Paid Family Leave (PFL) program.  The pay calculation is similar to how the SDI amount is obtain from what i understand.    Thus, you can get up to 12 weeks (14 weeks if c-section) off of work with some pay after the birth of your child.    However, make sure to check with your HR to confirm the information and see if your employer has its own policies about your leave.      Good luck!  :)

EtCRnDJMaa	my daughter is int he 3rd grade & they've already started it|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I'm not much help here considering I'm old and my children aren't in school yet but I learned it in either 4th or 5th grade.|`|j2mRop0laa	Woah! That is very late in the game, IMO. <br>  <br>  I home schooled my oldest daughter, at the time, but we covered basic division in second grade. <br>  She went to public school the next year and they started teaching right about 3 months into the school year. My daughter had already learned it so the teacher kindly jotted down a few "tougher" problems on her worksheet for her to work out. <br>  <br>  I'm amazed though, that in 4th grade they haven't been doing this for awhile. I think maybe *you* should go ahead and give her a head start.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I don't remember when the school started to teach it. They were using some weird way to do it and it didn't matter if the answers were right or not. Somewhere around 4th or 5th we just started teaching him like we had been taught. Tables and flashcards.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	My son is in third grade and is doing it now.  He started about two months ago and now they are working on long division.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Nursery.|`|prqrQcd1aa	My oldest is only in first grade and they aren't doing division yet. My youngest brother is only 13 years old, I do believe that he was doing simple division in either 3rd or 4th grade. <br>  It may depend on what level of math your daughter is in, as to when they start to introduce division. I was in "middle" level math, I think we started going over it the end of 4th grade and then really went into it in 5th grade. My youngest brother is in "high" level math, and I know they started showing him division earlier than I was taught.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	It really depends on where you are.  It may be *introduced* by third grade, but typically it is not focused on until fourth...often pushing it toward the end.  For example, in the state I'm currently in...fourth grade standards are that they be able to find the quotient of two whole numbers with a one-digit divisor.<br>  <br>  You are always welcome to pull up the mandated curriculum and standards of learning for your state (if you live in the US...don't know about other countries.)|`|a9YfUGzSaa	We learned long division in 5th grade.  3rd and 4th grade were spent heavily on multiplication, both the tables and double digits, and I also seem to remember learning to count back change in 4th grade.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I believe i did that in 3rd grade.  My daughter is only in kindergarten so i can't tell you when her school covers that information.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	My child isn't old enough for school yet, but if I remember correctly I didn't learn that in school until the 5th grade.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	I went to Catholic school and we started division in third grade.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	4th grade is when  long division is first taught in my state.|`|zHRWklEWaa	We did in it 5th and 6th, maybe just starting in 4th.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	3rd grade, but, they ignored it until 6th grade, when they FINALLY started it again<br>  i have no idea why they refrain from such basic math skills for so long|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Mine started in second grade. By third grade they were working on long division. My sons 4th grade class is currently learning how to multiply fractions.|`|5lFppGAVaa	they start the end of third but they definitely are doing are covering it in 4th grade.|`|73808e403987212ba673162fcda0802daa	We started in 2nd grade and learned all by 3rd.|`|ysUg2Rgraa	My 9 & 10 year old who are both in 5th grade learned it in third grade.|`|wNOSCfTJaa	yea i didnt learn that untill like grade 5 or 6--and i was really good at math(i still am by the way)
p2Njf5gBaa	Around 9 -10 months.  My son was getting close to walking and I didn't want to delay his walking.  Plus he was trying to pull himself out, and the time he almost succeded was the day I put the saucer and walker and jumper in the basement,|`|XOtOMncwaa	When my son was crawling he began to loose interest in it... he got in it occasionally but I think I put it away when he was about 9 months old. We went into the garage the other day to get something and he saw his exersaucer, he freaked and ran over to it, and tried to get in it! He's 13 months old!|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I don't remember how old my son was, but we stopped using it when he wanted to be out crawling around rather than be in the exersaucer. He would only play in it for a couple of minutes and then want out.|`|u94HOVz7aa	when my daughters would try to climb out and hurt them selves i would take the seat out so they could crawl in and out throught the bottom, but still play with the toys.  then i took it away when they quit playing with it.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	my daughter started pulling herself out of it, that's when we stopped! it was around 10 months or so i think|`|jwGkGaiCaa	My parents stopped using the exersaucer when the baby got bored of it (for one of my brothers it wasn't until he was two). He just loved it so much they didn't take it away. Its a nice place to put a baby when you're really busy and can't chase them around.<br>  <br>  I suppose a more normal thought would be around walking time because they have so much else to do|`|GognIJnBaa	You are supposed to stop using the Exersaucer when your baby becomes mobile for himself, so once crawling/walking begin.  My son isn't at that point yet, so I don't know when I'll quit using it exactly, but it will be around the time he becomes mobile on his own.<br>  <br>  I don't know why Pumpkinsmommy got a thumbs down either.  It's a good answer!!!<br>  <br>  Take care!|`|28QPS6V9aa	My daughter is almost eight months and now that she's crawling and standing she doesn't enjoy her exersaucer much anymore. Now I only use it if I have to shower and nobody is home to watch her. She usually throws a fit if I put her in it though. I'll probably stop using it within the next month or so.|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	My daughter is almost 8 months, and she's already started to get bored with it.  Now that she's crawling, the world (well, the livingroom!!) is calling out to her to explore!  I still use it occasionally when I need to cook or use the bathroom.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	After he was mobile (crawling well) he was done with his jumperoo. That is the closest we had to an exersaucer. He was a little over six months and he made very clear that he did not want to be confined he wanted to be all over the house!
BaXruEcqaa	Its nothing like a pap.  they put some jelly on your tummy and press a device on your stomach used to see inside your uterus, and they just move it around.  Thats a pelvic ultrasound.  If you're having a trans-vaginal one too, they will have to insert something in there...but its not uncomfortable and it wont hurt or scrape like the pap.  Dont worry, its nothing to get anxious about. You do have to have a full bladder for the pelvic, that might be a little uncomfortable, holding in the pee, but thats it.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	"Not going to get anything shoved up me"     Do you have any idea what you're in for? What's going to be coming out of you? They are going to "shove" a tampon size wand in there to find the baby....don't worry, they are gentle with it, I wouldn't call it "shoving" anything inside you......|`|I7sS4w0maa	Hi again,<br>  <br>  It really depends on the doctor.. They may do what is called a Trans vaginal ultrasound where they do stick a probe up your vagina to get a better look around. or they may do a regular Pelvic Ultrasound where they use a Device that looks a little like a computer mouse and they run it over your abdomen ( PAINLESS) <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK and again keep me posted|`|ic7sy50oaa	Depeneds how far along you are... if youre really early in your pregnancy they have to do an internal ultrasound! Its not as bad as a pap. Its all worth it when you see your little kiddo for the first time... and his or her little heart beating! Its awesome... youll forget what it even feels like!|`|6igjX2cnaa	If it's related to ttc, then yes, the ultrasound will be a transvaginal one.  That's the only way they can really see what's going on inside of you really well. Good luck hun!|`|iMY2fgYdaa	are you pregnant? how far along? depends on those<br>  <br>  then yep..you'll get an internal ultra sound...its not bad..doesn't hurt just a little weird..but they will be inserting into you
MxhNzW7Oaa	Did you figure that out?<br>  <br>  Last time I tried going on there, it confused the heck outta me. I got signed up & then didn't know what to do!<br>  <br>  I think you should flood her page with comments (if its like myspace). That'll teach her. Kinda like one word comments that make a sentence.

SaRDq9iLaa	Last week I had a dream that someone tried to take my daughter, which is my worst fear in the world.  The next night I had a dream that my husband's aunt and grandmother tried to take her.  I guess they were more of a nightmare than a dream.  The first one scared me because I really thought she was gone but the second one was kind of funny.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	Right now, because we live next door to a drunk...I have fears of our apartment catching fire from him falling asleep with his stove on(has happened twice)  When we move I'm sure there will be more fears!|`|xXnFx6qLaa	I'm scared to pass 18 wheelers on the highway when Johnny's in the car.  I will seriously just follow them all the way down the road until I get home.  I'm scared that the one time I actually try to pass them they are going to swerve and smash into my car.|`|zQWNb6neaa	I cannot handle them using glass bowls. I had a glass pitcher break when I was 12 and it made a gash that opened up most of the back of my right hand. It makes my skin crawl if I see them holding a glass bowl, and only bowls for some reason. I don't mind them having a glass cup. My husband gave my 3 year old son a glass bowl to throw up in a few days ago and the whole time he held it my back was tense and I couldn't wait until he was done to clean it and replace it with a tupperware one.|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	My husband thinks I'm weird for this fear.....<br>  <br>  I worry about war coming to our country, like 9/11 with an invasion and they storm our houses and harm us and take us as prisoners.  No law to protect you, my son is in danger, they don't speak english and I can't communicate and loved ones are missing and taken and I can't help anyone. Everything goes into ruins and there is no civilized US and I live out the remainder of my life and raise my son in a war torn country. <br>  <br>  Also on a sillier note...the dark in general, and walking up stairs!  I constantly get this feeling while walking up stairs that something is coming up behind me and it freaks me out!!  If I'm in the dark I freeze and have to keep my eyes closed.  Very weird for a grown woman, I have to say!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	yeah my son doesn't mind sleeping in another room but i am terrified that there might be a fire or someone would break in and i couldn't get to him. when i was little ( about 3) someone broke into my house and came into my room and pinched my butt and woke me up. i remember it so i guess i am paranoid. i lost my mom when i was little too andd i guess it had a big impact on me and i am jsut afraid of those things. when i watch my brother for my dad  ( he get home at about 3:20) i call at like 3:30 to make sure he hasn't got into an accident. same with my fiance. my yeah i am paranoid|`|YmEGCGtnaa	I don't know if it's "strange' exactly as my fears seem to be pretty common among other moms, but ehre they are:<br>  ---getting rear-ended with my baby in the back<br>  ---somebody on the road getting mad at me, and then taking it out on my baby (think man who threw woman's dog over the freeway bc she cut him off type things) or purposely rear-end me out of rage<br>  ---being a victim of crime while out with my baby---thievery, mugged etc., and somebody threatening to hurt my baby if I dont give them what they want <br>  ---basically, somebody hurting my baby in order to hurt me/get to me, that has got to be my WORST fear right now, and mostly of a random stranger doing it, bc at least if it was some1 i knew (which no1 i know would ever do such a thing, but hypothetically) I could try to talk to them and reason with them<br>  ---and of course, fear my baby will get kidnapped when i go out to the store with her, that if i even turn my back for ONE SECOND, and leave both hands on the stroller, somebody will still snatch her and I'll look and she'll be gone, out of her car seat.  <br>  ---Also, I don't let anybody ever drive my baby in their car without me along bc I just feel too scared they're not as careful of a driver as I am and will get into an accident with her in the car.|`|xnhwmontaa	LOL I never thought about that! Now I do and will too be putting hot food in the trunk lol. I worry even though my windows are locked and have that guard so they can only open like two inches i still worry sometimes my three year old will get on the roof with her one year sister and play up there! I know its crazy but i think about it!|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I hate driving across bridges with my son. I'm always afraid I am going to have a blow out and go off the bridge and not be able to get my son out of the car. When he was little I used to almost have panic attacks if I had to drive across a bridge.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	I have the same fear as Johnny's mommy. I hate passing them and almost have an anxiety attack while doing it. Its not so bad in the summer, but now its winter and we are having constant storms and I just freak. Even with my husbands driving I have to shut my eyes while he's passing.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	not strage but the normal <br>  SIDS is my big fear <br>  or me accidently steeping on him and squshing him|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I have fears of my 3 year old drowning and being hit by a car....I've had visions of both...very detailed. It scares me but I think I got those from when I was a sheriff dispatcher and I had to hear the calls. If I hadn't I'm sure I wouldn't have. <br>  I don't let my son eat in the car very often. Too much of a choking hazard, I'm not sure I can get out of the car in time to save him AND when I took and EMT class they said a lot of people choke on their gum when they get in accidents and end up dieing so I don't let him have anything whether he chokes on his own or we get rear ended and it gets shoved down his throat.....no thanks|`|lGcpXteaaa	I have never even thought of your fear before, but you have made me think now! lol<br>  <br>  I am a crazy worrier and sometimes it takes over my life but i just cant help it!!<br>  When i was pregnant i was terrified being in the house overnight by myself, just in case somebody broke in and they hurt me and the baby. I still have that fear now!!<br>  <br>  Now i hate every time i get in the car with her, i just always think there is no way that tiny little body could survive a major car crash!<br>  <br>  I hate thinking that i might get mugged while i am out. Just thinking they could hurt her makes me so sad! I often have nightmares about this...its horrible.<br>  <br>  I get scared thinking she could get sick. It is something i have no control over and it scares the hell out of me!|`|y6g0RnuAaa	My biggest fear is that something will happen to me and my son will be without me. Until my son was about 6 months old I has this intense fear of SIDS and I would barely sleep and check on him constantly. Car rides are very stressful for me now too. I am afraid that someone will pull out in front of us or run a red light.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Wow, you have just made me completely re-think hitting up a drive through! <br>  <br>  I don't really have any strange fears when it comes to my son, but when he was first born I was always scared he was going to get sick, for approximately the first month of his life I took his temperature every hour on the hour! <br>  <br>  I do have a strange fear myself, and that would be deer, one caused me to get in a very serious accident (well my own stupidity of swerving caused it) but now every time I see one I have an anxiety attack!|`|iSFI6igbaa	I have tons of weird fears not never thought about the fear that you have.. I have fears that my kids are going to be switched at birth, come up missing or dead, i hate driving with my kids period i am afraid if we get in accident then something bad will happen to them i have fears about anything and everything but that's what moms fear...|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I am one of the most neurotic worriers ever! I worry that i will fall down the stairs while holding my child. I worry that I will forget that he's in the car or at home and leave him there. I worry about silly things like the tree in my backyard that leans just a bit and if it fell over it would hit right about at my hallway between my kids' rooms. Then what?? I make my  daughter walk her bike across bridges fro fear she'll fall over the dies. Please don't tell me I need help! I completely understand!!|`|6Zdfx7QOaa	"Just me" - I worry about war coming to our country all the time, too. I mainly just worry that Texas will be the point of a terrorist attack or something.<br>  <br>  My one fear is that my daughter will get some kind of life-threatening disease or some kind of ailment that will hinder her ability to have a normal life. I am especially paranoid about autism, I guess because 1 out of 150 kids has some form or another and that is a lot of children.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	Yes, I do man I thought I was the only one. My husband says I'm weird because of this. My worst fear is that my 8 year old son will pick up the baby and start walking with him and trip and the baby's head will hit the ceramic tile, so anytime Alex goes to try and pick up the baby I freak out.|`|776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	Bees.  Neither of my kids (1 and 3 years old) have ever been stung so I don't know if they're allergic.  I'm so terrified that they'll be stung and have a life threatening reaction.  I actually punched a wasp out of the air one time because it was flying around the baby.|`|DnBMRRXaaa	i fear that he will choke with in his car seat and i wont be able to get him out intime.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	When my daughter was born SIDS was my biggest fear. I was scared of her rolling over and suffocating. It got to the point where I would wake up the minute she rolled over then I would roll her back over. Once I heard that pacifiers reduce the risk, that made me feel a little better. Im scared to take my daughter near the celler that is in our backyard because my brother in law said there are black widows in there. So I dont take her near it unless Im holding her because Im scared the she will get bit. That can be deathly. Im also scared of her getting into the back bedroom of our house because that is where the cat litter box and she doesnt need to be eating anything in there. My daughter also scares me when she is on the couch with us. She gets close to the edge and Im scared that she is going to fall off and hit the coffee table. That is all I can think of. I know I have a ton of fears but those come to mind mainly.|`|3rda58OCaa	What a cool question!<br>  <br>  I have sooo many fears!  Before i had my daughter i was never afraid of anything-i never even thought about safety!  Now I am a real "geek" when it comes to safety!  My biggest fear, though, is loosing my daughter not so much death loose, but lost or kidnapped lost.  I totally panic if i think she is gone, and i check on her all the time at night thinking someone is going to come in and get her.  It is just the worst feeling to me to think that if she were lost or kidnapped and she were crying for me and wondering why mommy isn't there to help her or comfort her or protect her, ugh, that is just my biggest fear!!!  I freak myself out when we are out and about she can be standing right next to me and I will just will have a panic attack thinking she is gone-it only last a split second but it totally freaks me out!  I swear i should take like a prozac or something when i go in public with my daughter!!  <br>   <br>  I am too afraid to let other people take my daughter out and everything.  She has never gone anywhere without me, but once with my mom.  <br>  <br>  I also have a huge fear of something happening to me, and me no longer being around to take care of her.  I have never feared death o9n any way until i had my daughter, and now things are so different!  I worry about myself knowing my daughter needs me to be aaroundto take care of her.|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	I'm pregnant with my first so i have no experience to go on but i have a few fears- nothing too crazy.<br>  <br>  I'm worried:<br>  ..about the epidural<br>  ..that the baby will be too hot or cold and i won't know<br>  ..that my mother in law will be as mean to my baby as she is to everyone else and i'll have to ban her or my brother in law when they start screaming for no reason<br>  ..that when my baby is born, if something is wrong, they'll hold the baby up for me to see them instead of taking them straight to the oxygen or whatever they need. (saw them do this twice on tv in one show.. premie babies that couldn't breathe and they took their sweet time getting them there so mom could see) i can see them in a second, help my baby!<br>  <br>  that's pretty much all i'm worried about so far|`|BKRhanxoaa	-I am always afraid that someone is gonna break his window and steal him during the night.<br>  -I don't trust anyone to drive him around but me<br>  -I am afraid he will be stung by a bee in in case he is allergic<br>  -I am afraid of dogs being around him<br>  -I am afraid I will die and not be there to take care of him<br>  -I am also SOO careful not to leave anything in the back window of the car in case we are in an accident and it flies off and hits the baby (or anthing dangerous on the floor.)<br>  -I thought of another one....I am always afraid that if our house caught on fire...me and my baby would be seperated by the flames!!! Or if the house was on fire and a fireman forced me to leave the house without my baby....I think about that a lot!<br>  ......and many more....I am such a worry wart!!!|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	1. our apartment catching fire and not being able to save or get my son out<br>  2. someone breaking in..kidnapping him and or hurting me and him<br>  3. I have intense fear that someone will hit us while in the car either by rear ending, running a red light, Or just being a stupid driver<br>  4. Or getting really sick( infection,cancer, or some other disease) that I could possibly prevent.<br>  5. The fact that we have a few sexual offenders, molesters that live in the same county. So I have to watch for everyone that comes near him in a store or parking lot etc<br>  <br>  <br>  But then again I really dont want my son thinking he cant go or do anything or live in a bubble. Its going to make me go gray way before I am 30 =)|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	My personal weird fear;<br>  In every place I have lived, or even stayed short-term, I work out my fire escape route in my head before I go to sleep. I even work out alternate routes in case a certain area is blocked. I was in a very minor house fire when I was younger, I wouldn't think that would be the reason, but it's the only thing I can come up with! Either that or I'm plain weird...<br>  As for my children... after being burgled a little over a year ago (stole smaller items downstairs but didn't wake anyone), I'v become paranoid that someone could come into the house while we sleep and take one or both of the children. I can't sleep unless I know every part of the house is locked up and secure, and I still panic at little noises in the night. I'v lost count at the number of times I'v stood at the top of the stairs shouting, 'i'm calling the police' to try and scare away the intruder I'm convinced is down there, only to see one of the bloody cats wander up looking all smug...
VMXl7Up1aa	Dunno but I like your play on names,I feel the same about Obama|`|9aRvkwLyaa	Hopefully you are. But don't hope for it to much!<br>  <br>  I am saying that because, before i got pregnant, for 4-5 months earlier, my mother-in-law kept asking me if i am pregnant. <br>  If i was one day late, she wanted to know. So i gave her the details. And it didn't happen, it kinda did hurt finding out that i wasn't. I kept getting my hopes up. <br>  But when i stopped hoping i am and saying it to my mother-in-law, that's when i found i was.<br>  And another thing i took a test about one and half months after. To be sure... Keep your mind off it that you are or maybe.<br>  <br>  All i can say is all in good time!!!<br>  And i do hope you are, but leave the test for a while. And be extra careful in what you do. NO heavy or minor lifting!!|`|Rgj6kTOwaa	of course this is normal hun considering how it has been for you in the past your like this because even tho u want to do the test to find out, u dont because then it mite come back negative again and u will be heartbroke again! i have a friend in the same situation and i feel so bad for her especially as i am pregnant, it is a nerve wracking experience! maybe do the test and see what it says, if its negative again then maybe look at other options like adoption etc! i really really really really hope its positive hunni and please let us knw!! sending lots of baby dust good luck!! xx
IFDfpbFJaa	Google a partial abortion.......it's gross, you'll see what they do to ensure the baby is no longer alive. I can't personally stomach it. I'm okay with abortion as long as it's done before 7-8 weeks when the baby is still a sea monkey.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	Yes, sadly this happens all the time. The babies are left to die.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Legally, if it is alive when it exits the womb the doctor must save the baby.  There are some adults who are alive today who are the result of failed abortions.  <br>  <br>  HOWEVER, it is no longer legal to do an abortion at an age where the fetus is viable for life.|`|i8Ch743Laa	They need a lot of life support if they survive that early on,and are on some type for a long time. The chances of it making it? VERY slim. I don't know if it would live or not,but I don't agree that it's ok even that late term.I just say it's mother's choice,not something I'd ever do..|`|Tc23KWgzaa	OMG  I knew that China was doing that sort of thing.  But I didn't know UK could get an abortion up to 6mo.<br>  That's cruel and criminal.

Usually the fetus is terminated inside the uterus. This doctor left the room after he induced the patient and she birthed a live premature baby and him and his nurses put it in a trash bag and disposed of it while it was living. This is not an abortion at this point since the baby was breathing so he actually did kill a baby. He lost his liscense and they are facing criminal charges.  But no, they are not alive after abortions. This was just a really bad thing that happened by a doctor who is screwed up.|`|fHgbL046aa	I always thought 13 weeks was the maximum even that seems wrong. I know different countries have different laws. That is kind of a scary thought. Some babies can be born at 6 months, but unlikely the baby would be breathing on its own. I guess when your not that far along they vacuum it out. I have heard when you are further along the doctor injects poison to the baby and the mother delivers the baby, and it comes out stillborn. You could Google it or YouTube, but I must warn you YouTube has very graphic material on abortions.|`|VEi3R0craa	no its not true.  My cousin had a late abortion years ago I am not even sure if it is still legal but they have her a vaginal thing almost like a pill and stuck in her uterus and sent her home.  She was in so much pain and bleeding and everything but she had to go back in three days and the did this suction thing to her.  So in that three day period the baby passed.  I am still upset she did that to herself and the baby.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Im very pro-choice...but even that has a limit with me.  And that limit is about 16-18 weeks.  <br>  I would imagine a baby aborted at 22-23 weeks would trry and breathe.  And from what I understand, it is just left to die.|`|be9f617f5a598e41354941dbb40d5e3eaa	Yes it can and it has happened many times throughout the world.  Very sad too because they can feel the pain of the abortion as well, at any stage of abortion.|`|AA10147946	Who the hell has an abortion at 22 weeks?  That's just wrong.  I'm all for being pro-choice and all, but make up your mind before then!|`|DNygQdmVaa	It is very likely.<br>  my son was born at 24 weeks,<br>  <br>  It depends on who did it and where its done as to what theyd do.|`|xzh8r0jIaa	i think it is sooo gross that people would have an abortion that late in  a pregnancy|`|yKS2UI87aa	Unfortunately yes aborted babies can survive. If the mother is past a certain gestational age they put her into early labor and most babies die during delivery some do not and are left to die. In the U.S., there was a story on it because at the time a nurse who worked at the hospital wrote to a paper, they used to leave them alone in the soiled linen closet, now they have a room and someone has to be present, but they still die. They tried to pass a law "No child born alive" but our current president voted no. It is very depraved to just sit and do nothing. If a Dr. did save the innocent baby I would hope they would not be prosecuted. We have a Safe Harbor, Safe Keeping law that you can drop off an infant and not be held accountable. I think they should try and pass it like that. It is not humane, decent, or logical to let someone die. If it were an adult and you just stand there and do nothing they charge you with criminally negligent homicide, depraved indifference. And at 22-23 weeks the baby is fully formed it's just small.|`|GnFCTnRCaa	According to Obama, the abortion must be completed. Which to him, the baby would die. <br>  It urks me that there are so many people out there who can't even have children, and there are people out there aborting their pregnancy when other people could raise that baby. I understand health concerns for the mother, but if the baby can survive outside the womb, it should be given that chance.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Yes. And they leave it to die. They got paid to kill the baby, and do you really think they care how long it takes to die? If you are sick enough to perform abortions, then you are sick enough to watch an innocent baby lay there and finish it's sad life. They just stick it in a jar, alive or not, and dispose of it in a biohazard bag.<br>  There have also been several speculations over the years about experiments even being done on these babies while they were still alive.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	If you really want to know how about you google failed abortions and see what really happens. Its just sick. Most doctors are not allowed to perform an abortion after 2 months, because by then they claim a baby is now viable. The baby is viable from the time it is conceived.|`|h4UzjZVnaa	You can hear your babies heartbeat at 5-7 wks, right?That's a living being. It should be TOTALLY illegal ANYWHERE. That's murder.|`|LcOPL8gCaa	The doctor isn't allowed to abort a baby after 2 months. its murder. (either way i think its murder.) But i think the parent would know, i mean. its breathing... look it up on google.|`|ftMjmp8Eaa	u know what i've read they do is that if they see that its still alive they just leave it there till it dies which is horrible
IFDfpbFJaa	Omg you are SO right....even when I answer something as best as I can and as sincerely as i can, I get thumbs downed like crazy! It used to really affect (or effect?) me but now I'm like whatever. I can be really rude at times....I can't stand when people say "how old were you when you got your cherry popped" or "I had sex with a dog, is he pregnant?" stupid questions like that just make me angry.   I'm always on here answering questions and getting ideas so my boyfriend thought it would be a cute idea to post a question in the pregnancy section asking me to marry him and it got reported and deleted but some other girl posted a question saying "Should I name my baby Phuc Mi? Middle name would be endabut"   and it's been up for weeks......I'm honestly getting sick of it on here because of things like that .....|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I rarely give thumbs down but I always seem to get them. I always wondered who went around and took the time to thumbs down everybody.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	I think that the thumbs down are because as parents most of us believe that they why we parent or the information that we know is better then someone else's. Parenting is a big subject. Everybody wants their child to be perfect and no body wants to be the parent of the child who does really bad things. <br>  I think this section is very personal to a lot of people. <br>  I give thumbs down when the information i read is incorrect based on a medical point of view.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Totally! I solidified my place on this site when I said I fed my baby formula. *Oh my God* not formula! When certain people read that, from then on out it is THUMBS DOWN *****! I could say I was knitting blankets for the homeless and I would still be a "bad person". Oh well, life goes on. I still use this site for useful answers since I am a new mom of my first child.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I know I do for the most part. Lol i'll probably get one for this to. It's ok though. I don't know anyone here so it doesn't bother me.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I always do too, but hey they are not raising my family, i am!|`|qesCemuRaa	It's so weird how judgmental people are!! A lot of times when people hear that my daughter is on formula I always get "the look" and they automatically start the lectures.. But they don't take the time to find out why my daughter is on formula.. I actually intended to breastfeed my daughter but a month in my milk completely dried up & there was nothing I could do to get it back.. So I had to start formula.. I was devastated to not be able to breastfeed but physically I couldn't do it.. Even though I would love to have been able to breastfeed I don't think that women who bottlefeed are terrible mothers at all!!|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	A lot of people give thumbs down to others who don't support THEIR particular brand of parenting.  For example, I always get thumbs-down when I'm talking about feeding formula to my daughter.  It never fails.  Or if I say that not everyone can or wants to breast feed.  Holy cow, you should see all the thumbs-down I get for that!!  It's silly really.  I guess there are a lot of insecure moms in this section lol|`|AA10949064	I get them constantly.  I really don't give sh*t.  I'm over the thumbs down trolls on here.  The only time I ever give a thumbs down is if someone is giving wrong factual info - otherwise everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  That's what this place is.|`|077c6d4e4b9978f72bfc78160c727f2aaa	Yes I have also noticed there are a lot of self-righteous parents on here.|`|AA10063059	you dont take any notice of the thumbs downs,half of them are only silly kids that do them,they dont mean anything
uVxajsfIaa	People kept telling me to eat dates in order to help to start labour. It didn't work for me, but I have several people claiming that it helped them to start labour. Pineapple is also said to help bring on labour. Didn't help with me either, but I guess it can't hurt to try.|`|NfbDQ1tYaa	with my son at 34 weeks i ate a chicken vindaloo and durning the night i had a bleed, i was told my uterus was contracting, i had him healthy at 38weeks, but i blame my bleed on the vindaloo haha :P maybe it will work :)
RvddYKqjaa	You need to call the local child welfare agency (Or whoever is in charge of fostering)  In MD they actually came to the house and looked in every room, telling us what we needed to do, including not just gates on the steps, but railings that a child couldn't get through. Our water heater temp had to be lowered too. There are a multitude of things they look for if your state is anything like ours. Good luck to you.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	if your seriouse about that then when you call child servcies they will give you all the info.

aiDV9FgGaa	They think it makes them grown. That is not a supposition. That is a fact. Any thumbs down I receive (and I count on many) are from teens who deny self-enlightenment.<br>  <br>  Or they are media-whores and think having sex makes them cool and suave. And grown. Then they have consequences and become pregnant.|`|1enIWBGnaa	For some reason, they think if they have a baby - someone will finally love them and they think it means they are now an adult.

You are very close minded. My baby was NOT a mistake, merely a happy surprise. I did not ruin my life, my future, or my education; actually, having this baby will only make me work harder, and give me more reason to do something with my life. I'm 15, and I'm 21wks5d pregnant. Of course I love my baby, and of course I'm happy about having her. I am proud of myself because instead of going out and getting an abortion, I chose to save my baby's life. Before I got pregnant all I did was drink and do drugs, so actually, I'm better off. I'd rather hold my daughter's hand for the next 18 years and beyond, than wonder what she could have been, and what I could have been.

A life off welfare? It's foolish to think that you could manage on your own. But it's not the girls you should blame: it's todays society. If sex hadn't been made a tabu, if it was spoken about openly, people would be aware of the dangers of unprotected sex.<br>  I want to scream everytime I see someone writing it's really hard to get pregnant when you're a virgin- I mean, that's a load of crap! Educate these girls and boys for future life. Sex IS a part of life, and it should be handled as one.|`|iPszwd8Baa	the only problem I have with it, is that you shouldnt be haing sex in the first place... Ugh! I think the requirement of having sex before your over 18 should be that you have to go out and take care of a baby totally by yourself, or with your partner while you go to school and have a job for at least a week, if the baby is okay, after the week, then you can think about wether you want that responsibility... <br>  <br>  most girls and guys dont relize it, but sex is horrible if your not in love, you get emotionally attached then you have your life and your baby possibly taken from you when you break up.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	The mistake is made, it is over, its done.

They should have pride they found an adult solution for an accident.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I think they realize by now that having sex wasn't their brightest idea. But choosing to keep the child,instead of aborting because it's "easier". Is a very mature and commendable decision in my book. Whether or not they decide adoption is the best choice for them,they are giving their child a chance at life instead of continuing to think only about themselves. <br>  <br>  They are proud of their babies,not necessarily themselves.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	I'm proud of myself for choosing to keep and raise my son, instead of being irresponsible and getting an abortion.<br>  No, I'm not proud of the fact that I had a baby at 18.<br>  But I did finish high school, I'm starting college soon, and I have a job.<br>  So please don't lump us all in to the same category.<br>  <br>  And my username is my son's name, and his birthday, because I love him.

If you go and look at their previously asked questions most of the time you will see that they are lying.  They do it to get a rise out of people.  As for the ones that are really pregnant and "proud," well they are moving on.  Why sit there and focus on how they made a mistake that effects the rest of their lives?  They are paying for their mistakes and are looking at the bright side of it all rather then sitting there like a bump on a log, pouting, and constantly thinking what should've/could've/would've been.  With every mistake you do, do you move on or do you constantly sit there and focus on it?  They move on|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	For me, teens being pregnant is not the immediate problem.<br>  <br>  It is what they do before(and after) getting pregnant, that annoys me beyond belief.<br>  <br>  First, The fact of having sex so young.  But also, if one or both parties are not the 'Age of Consent', it becomes a matter of, having broken the law and, depending on the age difference, it may be a felony.<br>  <br>  That is the first irresponsible act.<br>  <br>  Second, When they find out they are pregnant, there is the inevitable 'What do I do?' question which for me, is like nails on a blackboard.<br>  <br>  Third, When they think the answer is abortion.  Abortion is not a way of taking responsibility for irresponsible behavior.  It is only a way of 'enabling' that irresponsible behavior to happen again.

Modifying the behavior and increasing attention span/communication through tutoring/study/other therapeutic efforts are a perfectly good way of promoting psychological health and academic success.<br>  <br>  Long story short: Kids may not like to study, they may have bad habits, they may have emotional issues, but they still need to study, learn self control and learn to focus.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, this means parents just have to say "Sit down and study" or "Why aren't you studying?"<br>  <br>  Is it annoying? Sure. But, it is something a parent has to do.

qM1qoDhCaa	I keep a few pieces, then had the rest sold. <br>  <br>  Tell your friend the truth. That you need the money and were planning on selling the furniture. People should understand these days with the economy. Offer to help your friend go shopping for good deals on baby furniture for her. For a $100 she might could get some good deals from thrift stores or the Salvation Army.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	I think selling the furniture is fine. Your friend has a baby, she should understand how tight money can get, and seeing as you have given her so much, she shouldn't expect you to give her something worth so much for so cheap. I give away little thing, but bigger things I either keep if there is a next time, or I sell it. (Unless of course, someone really really needs it, then I would give it to them, but only if I knew the situation was dire)|`|1S7uXsInaa	I give some stuff to family, but I do sell most of it.

As far as your furniture goes, I would definitely sell it on Ebay if you think you can get $800 for it.  I think it is really selfish of her to offer you so little, especially since you have given her so much already.  Explain to her that you really need to get at least $800 for it in order to have the money you need to purchase the set you want.  If you don't get that much, then you won't be able to get the new stuff, and will need to keep the old.  She should understand and either offer you $800, or let you sell it on Ebay.  If she doesn't understand, then she isn't much of a friend.|`|iIJm5JToaa	You were more than generous, and she should appreciate that.  You gave her necessary items, for feeding and clothing.  I personally sold most of my stuff, so I could afford the next size he needed.  For her to offer $100 is either her being selfish, or not knowing the true value.  Furniture is not a necessity, she could go spend her $100 on Rubbermaid totes and accomplish the same thing.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would say use craigslist to sell furniture locally, it's so much easier and faster, and you  don't have to move it.|`|xy0W50Lqaa	Well my family bought me a lot of things for my baby like baby swing, bouncer, nursery furniture, toys, etc and I've packed away the baby things including her clothes.

A  friend eh...yeah right.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Well, you can list it on ebay and have her bid right along with everyone else. She should already have those things anyway. I have the same problem except she never offers any money. Always says she's poor. I finally just started giving her only the stuff that didn't sell on ebay, because I did not want to waste the clothing.

And you already know someone who will buy it for $800 or so. So you would love to give it to her, but then you wouldn't have any left over money to buy new furniture. She should understand.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Ya I wouldn't give her the bedroom set...NO WAY!    I would sell it on Ebay before you gave it to her. Times are hard for everyone right now and you need to think about yourself. Put it online and sell it.

Giving good furniture away is nice for the recipient, but not prudent.<br>  <br>  Tell your friend that you'll discount the furniture off the prevailing worth...maybe 25%...but can not sell it to her at such a loss. Go on ebay to establish some value, then let her know.|`|thoMmZAvaa	Set the price your looking for (either ebay or otherwise), then let her know that while you have no issue with selling it to her that you need to get more money for the items. Let her know the price you've decided upon and that if she still wants the items, their hers otherwise you're going to try to sell it elsewhere (I'd suggest Craigslist if your EC-free and you can keep it local so no delivery charges or having to drop it off somewhere). While I've been graced with a very generous friend who has given me a lot of what you've given (plus two cribs), I don't expect it from her and will always offer to pay her for the really big items. When they refused, we took them out for a nice dinner instead. I think if you want to sell something that's yours, then do it, offer her first dibs (at your price) then move on, she should be able to deal with the reality that you might want to sell your things and reinvest the money into your family. If she needs any explanation (which she shouldn't), just tell her that they're very expensive items and you'd like to re-coup some money to help with other expenses for your child.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	The economy is tight, sell your stuff. <br>  <br>  She should be thankful for what you gave her already.  I do a little bit of both.  I give some things away and I sell some things.  You might need that money for diapers or who knows what down the road.<br>  <br>  If she is terribly strapped for cash, then she can buy those things at yard sales or consignment shops for a much lower price.|`|QTSsGbubaa	I sell some , keep some and clothes i dont want i give away to friends. i have sold stuff online and honestly i think u should sell it on craiglist instead. ebay charges you to put it on there. if u do it on craiglist u dont have to wait for an auction to end if someone responds that day u can gt rid of it that day <br>  good luck|`|TWYkVjiJaa	i would just tell her the truth,that youve seen the bits that you realy want to get but need to get the money to get them! then tell her shes more than welcome to buy them but at the price you need!|`|2a726b94b1136e6caf4d74c8981c9e24aa	We have sort of a barter system.  Almost everyone I know is having children right now.  They gave us a lot of stuff when our son was born, and now that they're having children we give it back to them, along with some new stuff we bought.  I'm sure that when/if we have a second child we'll get stuff back and more.<br>  <br>  That being said, I'd just be honest with her and tell her that the set is worth a lot more and you need the money.  Any true friend would understand about that (I know I would).|`|89b9b79c918cf6555bea31d3d7be7d94aa	i kept almost everything all of my daughters clothes are washed and packed away for the next child i dream of having in the near future. i thought about selling the swing and play mat or giving it to my friend who is pregnant, but in these days and times when money is so tight it would be better for me to keep these items. the only thing i sold were some baby toys, the walker, car seat, and pack-n-play. these things can be replaced easily and they also have an expiration date so it would be better to buy these things new. as for your situation, try craigslist.org if you want to sell them for a good price rather than  giving them away for free, because just imagine if your friend sold them and made a big profit off of the crib ext. you paid for the crib you shouldn't feel obligated to sell/give them to your friend|`|IWinNj2saa	You should definitely charge for the furniture. Little things like bottles, slings, and clothes aren't things I would charge for, but the furniture, I would. She shouldn't expect to get it for free...but since she is a friend, maybe less than you thought you would be selling it for. Determine exactly how much you would like to get out of it, and then drop the price for her a little. You might have better luck selling it local in your newspaper, then you would selling it on ebay. Shipping for a crib and changing table is expensive, and might deter buyers. Good Luck|`|hSJnaysiaa	I don't think you should feel bad about not giving it to her for only $100. We bought a used crib and paid $150 just for that (its beautiful, antique white four-poster) and then had to buy other furniture also (dresser, nightstand, rocker, etc).<br>  <br>  I would be realistic though about ebay, many people don't want to pay shipping on such large items, and as a seller shipping those larger items might be a pain in the behind also. You might try craigslist.org in your area. That's where we bought our crib from and didn't have to pay shipping because we picked it up ourselves.<br>  <br>  I would just tell your friend that since you are hoping to buy another crib set (or toddler bed, or whatever you plan to use the money for) you were going to look online to sell your used stuff to make back some of the money you paid for it and that you were hoping to get more than $100 for it. If she has priced new baby furniture at all, she should know its not cheap.<br>  <br>  Don't feel obligated to give anyone anything for less than you think its worth, but also be realistic on its worth. Just because YOU paid $800+ for it brand new doesn't mean someone will pay that much (or even close) for used furniture.|`|nhgQKvwEaa	I gave away all of my first son's stuff, but when i got pregnant again 2 years later i felt stupid for doing that... I had nothing left so i had to start all over again, and waste another ton of money when i pretty much had everything plus more to begin with! Now, I just seal all of my 5 month old's stuff (things he outgrows, doesn't need) in bags and store them away for any future kids we have. It is your stuff, you should sell it for whatever price you want. Just tell her how much it's all worth, and you won't go any lower than that. If she's your friend she'll understand!
Fa130w6Gaa	They throw the poor innocent babies into the garbage. I think it is horrific!|`|pCZPtegeaa	Not the place for that question. People with happy healthy babies don't want to wonder what they do with the babies that weren't given the opportunity to be healthy and happy.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	They put the "fetuses" in bio-hazard bags and throw them in the trash.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	They throw them in the trash can.|`|a9btWYKRaa	No, not something I wana think about thanx.|`|O6DSFJbTaa	I can give you a link to show you!!!!!!!!!!!  GROSS!|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I always assumed that they disposed of it like they did any other medical waste.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Nope, never thought about it.  I assume they are disposed of as biological waste.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	I've seen movies. I do know what happens. Took a sociology class and this was discussed. But I'm only pro-choice for the sake of the pregnant girls who are going to have them anyway. I'd rather keep it pro-choice so those girls who are going to have abortions anyway stay safe. Because those girls are just as important as those babies.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	i already know what is done to the fetus. i don't have to wonder. still doesn't make abortions wrong or murder.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	Aislyn's mommy is right!

Xp2De933aa	hmmm defiantly sounds possible. i would say implantation occurs anywhere from 6 to 12 days after you ovulate, so like i said it sounds very possible.<br>  good luck to you! hope you find the answers your looking for!|`|smsUZG4Iaa	normally a woman has implantation bleeding 8-10 days after ovulation.. now this depends on your cycle..|`|XO4talxxaa	I hope you are preggo, i heard a lot of poeple get implantation spotting!

DRb4Qlypaa	Maybe anywhere from 20-25 weeks. Maybe more, depends on if this is your first pregnancy or not. You usually show later with your first.<br>  But don't worry, THE DOCTOR is the only people that you should be listening too. If the doctor has not said anything about it, then you are fine. And when people tell you that you are too small, ask them when they got their degree in medicine and that if they didn't it is none of their business.|`|MG7S22iMaa	5 or 6 mths<br>  <br>  I didnt start showing with my first pregnancy until I was almost 6 months and when I was 9 mths it only looked like I was about 5 mths. I was really tiny but my doctor kept telling me that I was fine and that my son was fine and that everything seemed to be normal. My son was really tiny when he was born but healthy. My second child I got to get big and was so happy and now with my third (due April 10th, 09) son I am a normal size that I should be.|`|fHgbL046aa	You look about 20 weeks -23 weeks pregnant.  You have a nice baby belly and I'm so jealous cause I don't have one. I am 19 weeks and 6 days pregnant and look over weight. I lost 6 pounds and I'm 147Lb. Congrats you look good|`|Zb7AGTwAaa	you look like your about 5 months....don't worry you dont look small...i just gave birth to a baby girl that weighed 7lbs, 3oz and everyone told me i looked small throughout my whole pregnancy.|`|M5HyStReaa	well you look bigger than me and I am due on the 30th June and my baby measured at scan last friday was spot on dates apart from 2 weeks longer legs<br>  <br>  so you are not too small at all!|`|OU9xnW86aa	26 weeks?|`|BnpEoMD4aa	you look perfect size.|`|7DQaZ9LYaa	that was like me at id say 4 months...|`|m3qSZelkaa	Do not worry about how big you are because I did not even know I was pregnant till I was 5 1/2 months along due to me not getting any bigger than just a little pudgier. I grew slow untill about my 8 month then I got big fast. It just depends on your body. You ook like you are small as well as I am. I barely weighed over 100lbs before I got pregnant. Just be sure to use lotion, bathe in it. I had my son last year and I am now 20 and I have stretch marks and HATE them! But do not worry about it you are growing GREAT!|`|jSn8Vd1taa	5 1/2 months?

fMilDRgLaa	I remember those days with the baby monitor.  I would wake at every little sound and then some. I think you should take a 20 minute power nap.  No more than that.  They really do help if it is cut short before deep sleep begins, but if you do not want to that excersise gives you more energy. It is hard to do when you are already tired, but it works.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Take a nap!<br>  <br>  Seriously, with a newborn you'll be tired again by tonight. The golden rule while having a newborn is to sleep while your baby sleeps.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	Take a shower. shave your legs.  By the time you get done, the baby will be awake, and you'll have no time to feel tired.  lol<br>  <br>  EDIT: just a thought here, but if the pillow shifted over his head, why is it SIDS?  Seems to me that the baby got suffocated.  SIDS means sudden infant death syndrome.  Which means the baby dies for reasons unknown.  It just pisses me off when people like Mystic throw $hit out there and scare the crap out of people for no reason.  SIDS is the baby dies suddenly and without cause.  Not because a mommy left him alone in his crib, not because a pillow got shifted, not because there was a teddy bear in his crib.  All of those are causes of suffocation, not sids.  And a mommy leaving her baby alone in a crib is NOT  a risk factor for SIDS!!!!!|`|0IPxeDJiaa	Take a nap.  Trust me, you'll be tired enough to sleep well tonight too!!  Just laying down for 10 minutes can a great pick-me-up.|`|AA11784984	COFFEE!!!|`|AA11795652	Coffee!!!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Yes you can have coffee, particularly if your baby is nursing as caffeine levels peak after about 1 hour after ingestion.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/health/lifestyle/caffeine.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/health/lifestyle...</a><br>  Most breastfeeding mothers can drink caffeine in moderation. Some babies, particularly those under 6 months, may be more sensitive to mom's caffeine intake. Babies whose mothers avoided caffeine completely during pregnancy seem to react more to caffeine in mom's diet. Even if baby is sensitive to the caffeine now, he may not be when he's a little older -- so if you do have to stop or limit your caffeine intake, you can try again when baby is older.<br>  <br>  Caffeine is approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics for use in breastfeeding mothers. Per Medications and Mother's Milk (Hale 2002, p. 100-102) caffeine is in Lactation Risk Category L2 (safer); milk levels are quite low (0.06-1.5% of maternal dose) and usually peak 1 hour after ingestion. One study has indicated that chronic coffee drinking might decrease iron content of breastmilk (Nehlig & Debry, 1994).<br>  <br>  If your baby is sensitive to caffeine, it will typically become less of an issue as baby gets older. Newborns have a much harder time metabolizing caffeine than older infants. Preterm or ill infants might also have more problems with mom's caffeine intake.|`|1S7uXsInaa	1.  Take a nap.  If your body is telling you that it is tired you need to listen to it.<br>  <br>  2.  Turn the monitor on the lowest volume possible.  That way you do not hear all the little noises, but will hear the crying-if he does cry.|`|jNHbw3PMaa	i think you should take a nap. i love naps! get them while you can<br>  <br>  <br>  **you can have coffee i breastfeed also and i drink it. just not a whole bunch all of the time
q4rG5Dwtaa	I have always used LUVS, with all three of my kiddos. No leaks, no rashes.|`|pXSKSS3daa	The same reason why any brand of diaper may cause babies to get rashes. Skin sensitivity.<br>  <br>  It's not just Huggies diapers, we used them for months without one problem.|`|xK6wehG7aa	Every baby is different. I can't use pampers because they make my son red. I don't have any problems with huggies or Target brand diapers though.|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	I used to work for Kimberly-Clark, the company that makes the antibiotic agent inside Huggies diapers.<br>  <br>  Your kids are probably allergic to that ointment inside it.  Other diapers use different types of antibiotic ointments in the lining of their diapers (to prevent UTI's), with different ingredients.  Kimberly Clark is using something in theirs that your baby is allergic to.  Stop using Huggies.<br>  <br>  Also, contact them and report the rash.  The more people report it, the more likely they are to investigate and make changes.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	I use Pampers and my brother uses Huggies for my nephew and he always has a blistering diaper rash too! I have not had that problem with the Pampers on my little girl although she is only 3 weeks old so who knows down the line but I have never put two and two together that the diapers were causing his diaper rashes. I will have to let my brother know and have him try different diapers and see if that helps.|`|AA10615926	I have never had that problem with huggies.|`|HYFIyANBaa	Im not sure about the rashes, but I have heard of that before and PLEASE do not toss the diapers,,donate them to some one who will be able to use them, maybe even a local daycare center or goodwill. Not all babies get rashes from certain diapers. They are Sooo..costly, maybe someone can use them!!|`|iSFI6igbaa	i think its the material they use for huggies, i use luvs and pampers and never had that problem with any other kind of diapers except huggies|`|qesCemuRaa	I had the same experience when my 4 mth was born.. Plus they leaked like no other!! I absolutely despised Huggies diapers.. I use Pampers & Ive never had any problems|`|yKS2UI87aa	Every baby is different, I use huggies b/c Pampers makes my son break out in a rash,|`|VNQHUIo1aa	They did that to my son also...poor thing.....my doc told me that it was a allergic reaction..

1S7uXsInaa	My daughter has always been fascinated with babies.  When she was 4 she became a big sister to my son, who is now 11 months.  She is a little mommy.  She carries, feeds, plays, changes clothes, etc with/to him.  She says that he is her "best friend" and I think she feels that she takes better care of him than I do.  She often offers advise and suggestions to me and my husband.  It is cute, but tough to take from this very grown up 5 year old!!! :)|`|PDHCOrOSaa	My daughter kisses and hugs but also pushes and hits...sigh....|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Children do this-my son used to kiss his baby sister till she cried sometimes-|`|FLpMShKNaa	Yes, its normal-there is a new baby at my 13 month olds daycare, and he is fascinated with her which also includes touching and pulling her hair, I have seen this with other older babies, they "love" the little ones just don't know the right way to go about it.|`|5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	My kids were never in daycare but it sounds ok to me.|`|Kmrl0FX8aa	Awe!

ev8ZZYx2aa	with the obesity rates in this world. I can understand why your doctor told you this. Juice is really nothing but sugar and water.|`|1S7uXsInaa	Water is always recommended.  It is good to get kids as young as possible use to drinking beverages without a lot of sweetness.  We alternated between water and 50/50 juice (100% juice w/out added things like sugar) to water so it would not be as sweet.  As a 5 year old, she loves to drink water, many times over things like juice.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	My ped told me that it wasn't necessary and I could give my son 2-4 oz mixed with water but do it sparingly because that's how children get obese and it can decrease their appetite for other foods|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	My pediatrician told me no juice for my baby.  She is almost 8 months old and has never had a drop of juice.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	yes, because juice is just sugar pretty much and water is more important, fruit is better than juice. i give my son juice only once in a big while as a treat basically he usually drinks milk or water|`|DDIBEvUTaa	our pedi calls it "sugar water"  it's all of the sugar & calories from the fruit w/few nutrients & no fiber.
CJ3XHvIDaa	well it's probably normal that u dont feel pregnant that much anymore. it totally happens but if your pains get serious then you should immediately go to the hospital. but if it's just alarming then just tell your doc, he/she is the best person that can tell you what's really happening.|`|AA10458750	It is normal at this stage....when it happened to me, I thought something was wrong too. It's hard to be comforted bc you can't feel the baby moving yet or anything.Your symtoms will be pretty much gone for the next month, so enjoy it! The pains is your uterus streching out, the pains will get stronger as time goes on.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	could possibly be a UTI or round ligament pain, or  worst case SPD (symphysis pubis dysfunction) although it's really early for that... Your morning sickness may just be gone for now. but the shooting pains could possibly just be a UTI. tell ur doc. simple weeks worth of pills. (if its bacterial)<br>  <br>  by the way, when someone says shooting pains up my vagina, usually you think of a UTI. when they say it's near my uterus you think of round ligament pain. don't knock my answer without thinking of how the question was worded. Thanks.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	round ligament pain maybe. I think it usually comes a it later. Ask your doc at you 12 weeks but that's probably all it is!|`|21LiTNVsaa	you are fine, it is just round ligament pain, which is normal as your uterus is stretching out, good luck and enjoy being symptom free for the time being!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I don't know if the shooting pains are normal but everything else is. Would you like your morning sickness back? haha just kidding. It goes away and now you're about to go into the second trimester where it's the calm before the storm of the 3rd trimester....which isn't that bad really until you're so pregnant you can't stand it anymore :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck and congrats!!!|`|uuHPneEcaa	Its normal. but if u will feel a lil more better u can call ur doctor. I always call my doctor if I feel a change during my pregnancy. I really didn't start to feel pregnant until I started showing and until I felt him move. Even with the ultra sounds didn't convence me.
02hspQaBaa	well it is different for every team.  When I played Little League I wore shorts and a t-shirt.  But now that I'm older, my High school team HAS to wear high black socks, gray baseball pants, long sleeve black shirt and a practice jersey we bought.  You can never go wrong with a simple pair of shorts and t shirt.  I would try letting him decide, because maybe he knows something about it that you may not.  Hope This Helps!|`|2gstVBcMaa	Why not just go buy a pair of  practice baseball pants.  just get a white pair...they do not need to be nice or anything.  but it is better then him destroying jeans or sweat pants that he already has.  just pair it with a t-shirt some normal socks and his baseball shoes|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	Uniforms are usually worn only at games...  <br>  <br>  He should wear jeans he can move in (no shorts or sweatpants he will likely try to slide into base at some point (all little boys do), shorts or sweatpants are welcoming slide-rash.. A light long sleeve tee-shirt (more protection from slide-rash) and cleats..  <br>  <br>  This part is going to sound really weird but it works..  Have him wear 2 pair of light socks.. With all the running, sliding and general mayhem 2 pair of socks will help him avoid blisters from the cleats..<br>  <br>  Another bit of advise..  Invest in color safe bleach..  He is going to get grass stains in places you never thought could get a grass stain...   Also unscented baby powder (Corn starch will also work)  a dash (get a large powder puff for application) between his legs before he puts on either his jeans or his uniform will help him avoid inner thigh rash...|`|6jAJ9ncMaa	I coached little league for 10 years.  The coach should have given you some info on what to wear and bring to practice and games.<br>  <br>  For practice, dress appropriately, comfortably, and with the weather.  He should also wear an athletic supporter or as most people know as a "Cup".  He will also need to wear his cleats.  Of course bring a glove and bat if he has one.

LoP2CRE2aa	Ok I am a little confused by your mulitpile spellings. You are trying to choose between Rowan, Rohnan, Ronan, and Rohan??<br>  <br>  Well, I personallyilke Ronan the most. It is very unique but sounds great! Rowan is adorable too, but for some reason I have always liked that for a girl (maybe I'm weird:) ).<br>  <br>  Ronan Tanner<br>  Ronan Quinn<br>  Ronan Xavier<br>  Ronan Tracy<br>  Ronan Cormac<br>  Ronan Everett<br>  <br>  And sice Ronan, Rowan, Rohnan, and Rohan all sound so similar. I'm sure the same middle names would work for them all. Good luck choosing! They are all great names.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	If it's between those two, Rowan.  'Rohnan' is, alas, one of those names that looks like a typo.  'Ronan' is fine, Rohan is (as far as I know) the name of a kingdom in The Lord of The Rings and nothing else, so I wouldn't reccomend it.|`|XZ8zBBpbaa	Ronan is an awesome name!<br>  <br>  Rowan is a terrible name... it's the name of the university in South Jersey... it's not a baby name.<br>  <br>  Go with Ronan... it's modern and yet timeless <br>  =]|`|0uhRgfcsaa	rowan.|`|99c7da01a300b1a3640f273390df38e2aa	I like Rohan the best - It is of Sanskrit origin and means ascending, healing, medicine.<br>  <br>  For a middle name why not choose something personal to you for example, your fathers or grandfathers name. <br>  <br>  Rowan means little red one - Good for a red haired child. <br>  <br>  Ronan reminds me of the character in Stargate Atlantis. <br>  <br>  Names :-<br>  <br>  Rohan James<br>  Rohan Thomas<br>  Rohan Tyler<br>  <br>  Good luck choosing.|`|C3aviMmyaa	I like Ronan the best. <br>  <br>  Rohan is from LotR, just in case you didn't know. There isn't anything wrong with it, though. I LOVE LotR.<br>  <br>  Rohnan does look like a typo<br>  <br>  and I always thought of Rowan as a girls name. But I do like it.|`|Gfj24Tb6aa	Rowan sounds a bit better.<br>  <br>  Rowan Mathew<br>  Rowan Tyler<br>  Rowan Seth<br>  <br>  If you were looking for middle names of the same origin as Rowan (which is Gaelic) here are some...'<br>  <br>  Rowan Aden<br>  Rowan Kael<br>  Rowan Kaelan<br>  Rowan Manix<br>  <br>  Hope I helpped :)|`|cvjPQ9tTaa	I love those two names, but I think i slightly prefer Rowan more.<br>  How about names like Rowan James and names like that. Good Luck : )|`|xmgMke5caa	Rowan! I really dislike Rohnan/Ronan. It makes me think of that anime Ronin Warriors.<br>  <br>  Rowan is a really nice name.|`|rGXrh38aaa	Rowan|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	i think of Rowan as a girl name for some reason.|`|A1S4X0DJaa	McDoom is right i'm afraid.|`|6d8da438bae03fbd57c6b9d8b3b83ff5aa	Rowan...<br>  <br>  With the middle names <br>  <br>  Alexander<br>  <br>  Christopher<br>  <br>  Nicholas|`|4fC6EJWfaa	Rowan<br>  Definitely not Rohan, I know a Rohan.... <br>  you really would not want to know this person.|`|34VXCyvVaa	Ronan -- strong and masculine.  Rowan is also okay.
LoP2CRE2aa	I like Finley, but not really Fynnley. It looks too misspelled that way. Fynn is such a cute nickname, but I think you could use it even with the spelling Finley.<br>  <br>  Finley Tanner<br>  Finley Xavier<br>  Finley Elijah<br>  Finley Reed<br>  Finley Channing<br>  Finley Warren<br>  Finley Hudson<br>  Finley Thatcher<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DCJAMtkHaa	I don't think the name sounds feminine at all!  I actually really love the name - it's on my list of favourites.<br>  <br>  I don't like Fynnley - it looks really strange because of the lack of vowels.  And I just don't like the whole 'y' replacement trend in names.  I just think it looks a tad cheesy.<br>  <br>  My favourite spelling is the original Finley.<br>  <br>  I don't know what to use for a middle name.  Finley Connor?  Finley Everett?  Finley Dawson?|`|UjsQRzAfaa	This is wild... I am pregnant with baby #3 and this name is the name we have chosen for the baby regardless the sex. I just love the name. My other two children (both boys) have Irish names, Brody William and Riley James. I think we have pretty much decided Finley Joseph if it's a boy and eith Finley Harper Rose or Finley Rose if the baby is a girl. I like the traditional spelling the best, althou others in my family do not.<br>  Congrats!<br>  <br>  Lyn|`|e67e5dfc74c396a718533bd7b4a5f8fbaa	it doesn't sound girly maybe a bit la de da, but not totally la de da, like the finley spelt way, the fynnley looks too much, and middle names jordan, morgan,max, spencer, ross,duncan,travis,wayne, price,mason, thats all i can think of and its got to go with the babies surname too but hope ive helped a little|`|cvjPQ9tTaa	I like that name. I don't think it is to girly and it is also unique. Spell it the way you want to spell it. <br>  I'm not sure about middle names if you don't want very common names because I can only think of common ones that go! But good luck in choosing : )|`|61NKzPzMaa	Finley is a masculine BOYS name. There is nothing feminine, girly or unisex about it.<br>  <br>  Fynnley is just awful.|`|pRbx4Y5Waa	How funny!  I was just answering another question for a favorite boy's name.  I LOVE Finn.  I like the name Finley.  I don't think it's too girly at all.  I like it spelled "Finley" as well.|`|pDrdCRQcaa	I don't like it for either sex. I think it sounds country, especially the nickname Fynn.|`|WIEPISyeaa	Finley is a LITTLE too girley for my taste, but it doesn't mean it's not cute.  I DO think spelling it "Fynnley" makes it EXTRA girley, though.<br>  <br>  If it were me I would spell it Finley or even Phinley to make it more masculine.  <br>  <br>  Have you considered Fineas or Phineas?  Those are masculine and you could still use Finn as a nickname.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!! :)|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I've heard it for a boy! I like it for a boy actually way better than for a girl. I'd stick with the spelling of Finley. The Fynnley spelling looks a bit weird - too many y's for my liking. <br>  <br>  Finley Cole<br>  Finley Noah<br>  Finley Brennan<br>  Finley Liam<br>  Finley Elijah|`|b36IZl3taa	that name is not so bad but what about remy or jwan and that name is kind of girly <br>  middels names beatiful or daen|`|cCXGEZxaaa	I'm sorry but all I can think about is Huck Finn|`|5ikuJsY3aa	I think thats a good name lol it could be FINN LEE lol what ever but i think it sounds fine!|`|u7o75zipaa	Finley is a really cute name for a guy. <br>  Fynnley looks really girly :S I'd avoid that.<br>  <br>  Finley Joshua<br>  Finley Craig<br>  Finley Damon<br>  <br>  ^ I like those. :)|`|DHwPgw9iaa	I don't think it's too girly at all. I think Finley is cute especially with the nickname Fynn.<br>  <br>  Finley Gavin sounds adorable, as does Finley Brian. Here are some other suggestions:<br>  <br>  Finley Noah<br>  Finley Jason<br>  Finley Alexander<br>  Finley Gage<br>  Finley Statton|`|8DF64P7Gaa	I love the name Finley, as a boys name. i dont get it when its a girls name... to me its just a boys name. <br>  <br>  I think if you do the Fynn or Fynnley it makes it more fem. so i would stay away from that if i were you, save the extra y's for girls.<br>  <br>  Well since Finley is irish and scottish i would keep with names that are irish or scottish<br>  Finley Kieron<br>  Finley Seumas<br>  Finley Donald<br>  Finley Kenneth<br>  Finley Shane<br>  Finley Monroe<br>  Finley Micheal<br>  Finley Callum<br>  <br>  Personally if i were to ever have two sons, i would name them Finley Joseph and Callum James.... middle names are after my dad and g-dad. so maybe you could use a family name as the middle name...?<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|T1qzML1Zaa	I like it as Finley. If you spell it Fynnley people are never going to spell it right and may even mispronounce it.<br>  <br>  Middle name suggestions - Liam, Connor, Wilder, Morgan, Grey, Wilhem, Mason, Monroe, Lysander, Marshall, Everett|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Sorry don't care for the name at all.

QLopvWKDaa	Did you try tea and honey? Steaming in the bathroom=close the doors and heat vent amd then run the shower on HOT.  You can even put Vic ks Vapo rub in the tub to add vapor to the steam.  This should help!<br>  <br>  But clean the tub well after, so nobody slips!|`|3EhoJ42zaa	a cup of hot water with lemon and honey always helped me.  Gurrgle warm salt water|`|Fa130w6Gaa	Run a humidifier in your house, especially the bedroom at night while you are sleeping. Dry air can cause a cough and since you say it's a dry cough, that is probably what is causing it. You can also use a saline nasal spray to help moisten your mucus membranes. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water as that will also help. Sucking on hard candies can also be helpful. Good luck! You're almost there!|`|9QZ9Ie1Jaa	try spermint tea and congrats on the baby ! get plent of rest now while you can!|`|DcrGonO6aa	My wife used one of those cool mist things... she said it helped with dry cough...<br>  <br>  Don't cough too hard!!!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://gripnpop.com" rel="nofollow">http://gripnpop.com</a>
AA11210211	lol yes I have!! Except the wipes didn't make me raw I use them when I have diarrhea,but one time I had a heat rash on my panty line and I used her creme and it cleared up.|`|lzivF4Idaa	i used the baby wipes all the time for random things, and i used his A&D ointment when i got a tattoo cuz i didnt feel like buying the crap you're supposed to use. works the same lol|`|a6f60f36c91e3044fa79431d1128c39baa	Yup.. I have used them one time I had diarrhea.. and it seems to work better than TP. I haven't used them since.. but once in a while I will. I tell my husband since they're so useful.. I'll be using them long after my son is potty trained.. ha ha.|`|cw2qwk9Uaa	4 sure! my daughter is turning 9 next month and I still have baby wipes in my bathroom.They are great to refresh urself...I like to stick some in the freezer in summer to take along when going outside...|`|7DQaZ9LYaa	you should get cottonel wipes. You can get the pop-open container & refills. Also they have mini travel packs. they work great!|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	I did indeed use baby wipes a few times... <br>  <br>  The most memorable was when my sister and I were shopping I used the restroom only to realize there was no T.P. my sister looked in all the other stalls still no T.P. thinking quickly I grabbed the diaper bag used a baby wipe and went on with my day...  <br>  <br>  I used my babies Desitin (unscented) once while at the lake water skiing.  I had forgotten my zinc oxide thinking quickly I remembered Desitin is mainly zinc oxide and I avoided a sunburned nose...  I did have to live with the indignity of my husband calling me "Butt Paste Nose" for a few hours until his nose began to burn and he wanted some Desitin...|`|wP0AjcQ1aa	Love using baby wipes! Have way before I had a baby. Not sure about the rash creme but if it is gentle enough for a baby, it is for you too!|`|fsHgUrcAaa	LOL I will admit, once I had some chafed skin "down there" and I used my daughter's Desitin...sure enough, it did the trick :)|`|6r6s5AfXaa	I've used wipes when I was out of TP.
ZZzQLjaKaa	It depends on your definition of success. When a family is caught up in only the basics, ie paying the mortgage and feeding the kids, sometimes things are lost. For example a single parent that must work 2 jobs to survive, may count on an older child to help raise the younger ones. Or even simple things could be lost, like reading to your children, or serving fresh fruits & vegetables instead of canned, boxed meals etc. However there is no shame in being poor...it just can cause a lot of additional stress upon a family unit.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	My husband grew up fairly poor, at one point his mom was raising 4 kids all by herself and he says some of his best memories are from that time.....having things does not equal happiness
Y32zA5Mfaa	I agree with Kaley.  These people obviously aren't going to feel any remorse, so I would not expect to receive any.  I would also consider letting them know that you are not available to babysit anymore.  Perhaps state that you fear for your own child's safety?  The other girl obviously did not mean to do it, but that doesn't mean that she won't 'accidentally' do something again.<br>  <br>  If you need another babysitting charge to fund the dance lessons, perhaps find another child that needs babysitting.  There are always parents out there who need child care.<br>  <br>  BTW, I am the same as you.  If my child did that, I'd feel bad and offer my help with anything (especially something as little as picking up some Motrin).  You are not wrong in thinking that.|`|VHHis05Naa	I'd stop babysitting her and look for other ways to fund the dance class.  Can't dance with broken bones...|`|tDb3osk7aa	hey chica its me ur cuz i agree with what everyone in here is saying if i were u i would not babysit that little girl again at least until the parents show some respect and remorse towards you and your little girl so what it was an accident they should have taught her better manners than that and if it were my son that did it u know i would be so upset and crying and asking or begging u to let me do something for u or the little one even pay for a dance class or 2 i think they have done u wrong by not calling and at least acting like they care and are conserned.good luck call me chica ok luv ya....:)|`|MG7S22iMaa	If the parents have not apologized or even offered to pay for the medicine then they will most likely never apologize. If I were you I would stop babysitting their child and just not have any more contact with them.|`|0IPxeDJiaa	I am so sorry for you and for your little girl!  How painful!!  Well, as for the rest I would set some strict rules for both the girls :<br>  <br>  Rule #1 SHARE<br>  Rule #2 ABSOUTELY NO PUSHING, HITTING, KICKING, BITING.<br>  <br>  Rule #3 Have fun.<br>  <br>  Dont' take it out on the parents, but I'm with you that they could have apologized and taken the chance to teach their daughter a lesson in compassion.  I think you caught the father at a bad time, plus you were probably upset - who would't BE????!  This isn't excusing his behavior.  It seems quite unforgivable.<br>  <br>  Big hugs to both of you.  Good luck|`|JsqMSU9Haa	you can't change people.  that being said, if they haven't apologized or even picked up motrin - most people would say f- the ice cream cake.  i would have nothing to do with these people anymore - certainly not babysit their child.  and if it comes up, it's not so much the childs actions, moreso the adults actions - that's where the child learns it from.  no, they aren't good friends.|`|1uEbQ4OSaa	If it had been my lil girls faught I would have done anything you would have asked for!  Accident or no accident I would have paid you, got your motrin, and said I am sorry a hundred times and def. make sure my lil girl knew that even though it was a accident that you cant play ruff like that.  I would be honest and tell them how you feel.  Tell them your not looking for a hand out but you would like to see some remorse.  Also make it clear to them that you are still interested in keeping their girl but you feel you deserve to be respected!
QLopvWKDaa	As your uterus grows, the placenta should move up. <br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor- they should keep an eye on as you near that all important day- Good Luck!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Sometimes a low-lying placenta will correct itself. How far along are you? As your uterus expands to accommodate the baby, the placenta will move too, so it won't necessarily be a problem then.<br>  <br>  You would have to have a c-section if it completely covered your cervix, meaning the placenta would come out first - which it's not supposed to do. I don't think it would affect an internal exam because they are only going as far as the cervix, not into the uterus.|`|AA11100500	I had a low lying placenta too I was going to have natural labor but it turned out at the last min I needed a c-section because the baby's heart rate was dropping and my blood pressure was all over the board but if it wasn't for that they said as long as her head was clearing the placenta I could have her.<br>  <br>  She's 4 months old now.|`|c3eb9cc5af710aa695ddf32e0b5e463aaa	The placenta -may- move up, especially if you are less than 24 weeks pregnant when the low-lying placenta is diagnosed and it is only -slightly- low-lying. Whether you need a c-section will be decided by how low-lying the placenta is as the pregnancy progresses. This kind of placental placement is called "placenta praevia", and there are different grades, based on where the placenta is lying in relation to the quadrants of the uterus, and whether it is covering the cervix.<br>  <br>  A low-lying placenta that is not covering the cervix at all, and where the baby is positioned in a way where his or her head won't put pressure on the placenta during birth -may- be able to be born vaginally, if you have an experienced practitioner.<br>  <br>  A placenta previa that is partially covering the cervix almost -always- means a c-section, and most babies are born by scheduled c-section so that the mother's dilation doesn't cause the placenta to start bleeding or separate from the uterine wall.<br>  <br>  A complete placenta praevia completely covers the cervix. These babies are always born by c-section, because there is no way that the cervix can dilate and no way that the baby can get to the birth canal. These babies are always born by scheduled c-section, usually 2 weeks or so before the 'due date' to make sure that the cervix doesn't start to dilate and the baby's head isn't forced down onto the placenta (which can cause a deadly hemorrhage in the mother, and oxygen deprivation in the baby)<br>  <br>  The fact that they've told you that it would be a bad idea to do an internal exam indicates that this may be either a partial or complete praevia, where an internal exam might start bleeding from the placenta. If that is actually the case, then a cesarean is going to be necessary for this birth. On a positive note, having a c-section for praevia is not considered a 'repeating' condition -- so you may be able to have a regular birth with a later baby.|`|sXCSVFBaaa	My sister-in-law was diagnosed with minor placenta previa in her 2nd pregnancy. They put her on bed rest and it fixed itself. It is possible, but that doesn't guarantee it will happen. If it poses too much of a danger to yours and the baby's health, then they'd probably have to do a C-section. Just take care of yourself and rest as much as humanly possible.|`|PumDOQC9aa	if the baby is not facing the way they should  for example: if his or her head is facing upside down you will need to have c- sections|`|Fa130w6Gaa	It is possible for the placenta to move higher but you won't know for sure until closer to your due date. Good luck!

Of course you would have to pay for that.<br>  <br>  If the baby was buried then its customary to have a grave marker.|`|XOtOMncwaa	If the baby was buried in a grave yard then it's actually appropriate to do so. It wouldn't be any different than putting a head stone up for someone, all you would have to do is contact the person that owns the graveyard and ask for permission.

Blissy<3|`|pz09LoOyaa	I would assume so I don't think it is illegal, i can't see anyone making a law about something like that.|`|KWaTVVpGaa	Yes. Sorry for your loss!
Fa130w6Gaa	I do exactly the same thing! The harm with baby powder is if they inhale it but putting it in the diaper away from them is fine. I think it helps make them smell good and probably feels good on their little tushy after being in wet diapers!|`|a9btWYKRaa	I have never used it. I have always been too concerned about them inhaling the powder. I always used creams at the first sign of redness, otherwise I have just kept them clean and dry.|`|xydJejapaa	well I would put the powder if needed for rash or something on the Dipper first away form the baby then gently set the baby's bottom down on it so they didn't breath it in.|`|1xNVPECpaa	no.. i didn't put anything in my son diaper unless there's a redness then i'll put a little cream...<br>  <br>  once, my MIL put baby powder when changing his diaper.. he got rashes..|`|XSmkmwohaa	Ive never used it. I usually just use penaten before bed. She has never had a rash. I just think that cream is less messy than powder.|`|5pgVIlLFaa	I love the smell of powder on my baby , so yes i would use a little.|`|ycvpRM3Oaa	I use it, especially over night when they sit in the pee|`|ySTDkd5iaa	I have always done this.|`|pCZPtegeaa	I don't use baby powder because I read something my daughter's pediatrician gave me saying that baby powder can actually seal in the moisture instead of locking it out. I don't know how true it is, but I use A&D ointment with every diaper change and Aquaphor healing ointment when Aislyn gets a diaper rash. Aquaphor works amazing, but it's soooo expensive!|`|YKCIubvKaa	I use baby powder whenever. I actually go right on the bum. Both babies are fine by the way. I don't use it ALL the time for EVERY changing. Usually before bed time. If they get a diaper rash of course but sometimes I will switch to the cream depending on the rash. They used Baby powder on babies for YEARS and only a few cases showed up which caused them to say "BABY POWDER BAD" I don't drown my kids in it.. it goes on their bum and than is put away.|`|Sz8KiJuvaa	i just use diaper rash cream on my baby a few changes a day to keep rashs from starting. thats what i was told to do. my doctor told me not to use baby powder because of the risk to the baby by inhaling it but they have talc free baby powder that as long as u put it on your hand or diaper first and arent letting a huge cloud of it get into your babies face you will be just fine.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I've never used it a whole lot, sometimes in the summer when my kids were real sweaty in the diaper area but not much more than that, don't have a problem with it just personal preference. Congrats on the new baby!|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I do the same thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  to earth angel, if you search long and hard enough, you will find something wrong with EVERY manmade product out there.  But in my opinion, that is just a whole bunch of added stress that we as new mothers don't really need.  Somewhere, some mother accidently poured WAY too much powder on her baby, the baby couldn't breathe, and now all of a sudden, guess what, baby powder is bad.  Like I said, take enough time out of your day and you can find a problem with everything.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I don't use it, the powder doesn't do anything other than make a mess, why bother.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	I use baby powder and I'm totally satisfied with it.It helps the skin not to get dry and prevents burning.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	I always used the cornstarch, never the powder.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I never used it. not for any particular reason, I just didn't!|`|3Z4YFz29aa	we used cream early on and then powder. Always cream if there was any redness.
JOVWBOOCaa	You still have plenty of time hun! Take the next few months and save up for something better. A crib is something you need to invest in, this is where your child will be sleeping for the next couple of years and often times longer for the ones that change to a toddler bed. There are reasons why some cribs are expensive and others are inexpensive. I bought my daughters crib at babies r us it was definitely one of the best (also quite expensive) however she will be 5 this year and that crib is in perfect condition not a loose bolt anywhere and I feel comfortable in fact would not use anything else for my new arrival! Research anything you buy for your baby but ESPECIALLY their beds and toys! I was trying to find something similar to what you were looking for and the first thing that came up when I looked into it would explain why you can no longer buy the crib you had wanted. This is what I found:<br>  Choosing the right crib for your family is probably one of the most important decisions you'll make for your new son or daughter. The crib is where your child will sleep most of the time, so all parents need to keep in mind the dangers a crib may pose on a sleeping child. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is only one of the dangers a young child can face. Many children are injured or killed due to poorly made cribs. Thus, you should take great care when choosing your infant's bed. <br>  <br>  My husband and I bought Simplicity's Nursery-in-a-Box about two years ago from our local Wal-Mart for about two hundred dollars. The Nursery-in-a-Box set consists of three major pieces of furniture: a crib, a changing table, and a dresser. Having a very tight budget for purchasing our baby essentials, we chose the Nursery-in-a-Box believing we found a great deal. <br>  <br>  The crib has the ability to convert from a standard crib to a toddler bed, which was another reason for making the purchase. The dresser has four drawers and the changing table has two shelves to put supplies. Since a mattress is not included, we purchased a standard size baby mattress (Kolcraft Pediatric 800). <br>  <br>  That night we began assembling it and found it very difficult to put together. Some of the holes drilled in the parts would not line up correctly with the corresponding pieces. We also ran into difficulties when we had to put together the crib's mattress support consisting of several rows of bars. Anyway, the whole assembly took several hours and it was long into the middle of the night that we finished assembling it. But it is not the assembly for which I regret such a purchase. Once assembled, I found some of the dresser drawers would not close all the way, probably due to the misaligned drill holes. When we put the mattress inside the crib, we noticed there was a gap of about 1" on each side (I can easily stick my hand in the gap without any resistance). I was afraid my daughter would be injured from it so I stuffed some blankets on both sides and hoped for the best. During my daughter's first year, I was concerned about it since my daughter rolls a lot while she's asleep. I became extremely concerned when I heard a report on the news about Simplicity's Nursery-in-a-Box. <br>  <br>  You may have heard about the recall for Simplicity's Nursery-in-a-Box in June of 2007 for 40,000 cribs. A second recall was released in September 2007 for one million cribs. Many cribs were incorrectly assembled due to poor instructions. The instructions told parents to install the drop side upside down causing the side to fall and the metal locking pins to pop off. The second recall states that the faulty hardware allowed the incorrect assembly. If the drop side was installed upside down, the drop side could become detached and children were at risk of becoming trapped in the side or falling. There is a handful of infant deaths reported due to the poor quality of the cribs. <br>  <br>  Our crib was part of the recall but our crib came with the new bottom track. However, that did not put to rest my fears that something could be wrong with the crib. Parents should refrain from buying Simplicity's cribs due to their unreliability and history. Children face a lot of dangers, so spare them from this one. <br>  <br>  For more information on the recalls, visit the US Consumer Product Safety Commission website at www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml07/073...<br>  <br>  I know times are tough but a crib is very important and if you find the right one it can be a great investment! My daughters crib goes all the way up to a queen size bed, a BEAUTIFUL one at that and will last her many many years (if not, I will have a very nice bed!) Hope this helps, just do your reasearch. Some good places to check are babies r us and burlington coat factory! Good luck!|`|iIJm5JToaa	Go on craigslist for your area, you can probably get your set cheaper.  Or you can find an all wood set for the same price, that will have better quality, and you won't have to assmeble.|`|xK6wehG7aa	Here's a few links:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GSQE0U" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GSQ...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.albeebaby.com/sicrnchcoelc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.albeebaby.com/sicrnchcoelc.ht...</a>
0ctwJF47aa	I havent tried it myself, when I saw the commercial for it I wondered if it really worked and considered buying it but after talking to my sons doctor she said not to worry myself with buying it, babies and young toddlers shouldnt be watching television they should be playing and learning to interact with other children and if you really do want to teach them to read when they are that young the best thing to do is open up a book. <br>  Goodluck!|`|wgAQK2GNaa	I was already reading at the time I bought my first one so it didn't help me too much - however the series is very interesting.<br>  <br>  A great read for any book enthusiast.
FASzVGrraa	i just bought some this month to try! i will soon have an answer for you! good luck and baby dust to all of us TTC! ((: <br>  <br>  <3|`|meJVXXhmaa	I tried the Answers Ovulation stips and found them to be ok.  I since then bought the Clearblue easy fertility monitor and love it.  It's a bit pricey, but worth it.  It's easy and tells you exactly when your time is.|`|tdNfQWaAaa	I used the Answer Ovulation kits for 2 months and I found them not to work on me... My doctor said some women have to low of LH to get a positive or some women have to have LH and get a positive for along time. But I would say its worth a shot, try them out. But I've also heard alot of women say they have no luck, so try not to get stressed if they dont work for you.. You can also chart your temp. But try not to stress and good luck!!!!|`|ispGAeDtaa	I have been using them this month. I used to be very regular, then I had a bug just before Christmas and then AF has been completely random!<br>  So I'm on CD 20 today, and have been resting since CD 12 but still no results. They say they don't work for everyone.<br>  I've also been using a basal temp chart this month - which looks the most reliable.<br>  I would also be interested in other peoples experiences with ov strips.
m3qSZelkaa	Don't be nervous. Just let the Dr do what he does best. He will probably check to see if your induced and do the normal checks. If your baby is in no harm he will probably wait to see if you go into labor by yourself, which you probably will. Then after being over your due date he will maybe schedule an induction. But he will probably wait as long as he can to induce you. Just ask him questions that you have. Believe me when I was pregnant I wrote a list of questions out and brought it with me to the Dr and ask EVERY single one. They are use to that, that's what they are there for. Calm down and relax, for the sake of your baby. It will be the best day of your life when you see your baby! Believe me it changes everything. Makes you such a great person. After you have your baby you will feel this warmth and kindness. You will feel complete. Its weird. But really neat!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I'm sure that like any other induction-happy doctor, he will mention it if you don't. It seems no one realizes that a typical pregnancy can go as long as 42 weeks anymore. <br>  <br>  And just because you have a doctor appointment scheduled, doesn't mean anything - I had my last appointment with my second child and wasn't dilated or anything, so we made another appointment for a week later. I couldn't show up that day because I was giving birth. So don't worry about - it's not like they're not going to know where you are. <br>  <br>  You can easily be dilated and go weeks before delivery, or not dilate until the last minute. So checking you over and over again won't accomplish much, either.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	All those things. Don't worry. The doctor knows what to tell you to prepare you. Just relax and enjoy the arrival of your beautiful daughter.|`|n8Db77zbaa	Relax. You shouldn't worry yourself about the questions you need to ask. Obviously you are confident about your doctor, because you've stuck with him from the beginning. If he's a good doctor he will cover all aspects of your upcoming due date, what to expect, when to expect, procedures (vaginal, c-section) he will check you as well, to see if the baby's head is poitioned the way it should be. From experience, if they feel the baby's head its almost time, if they barely feel it, but it feels as though the head is still "bouncing" or "floating around" you still have some time to kill. You can be a week later than your due date and still be okay. Congrats!|`|gklH61Uiaa	You will have another appointment after your due date (if you haven't had your baby yet)<br>  You won't need to be induced for 10-14 days after your due date, so don't worry about that yet.<br>  Your doctor will probably talk to you about the possibility of induction, just so you have a bit of an idea what to expect. But it's really best if you can go on your own!|`|BnpEoMD4aa	don't get induced, please. that's ridiculous. your baby will come on his/her own time.|`|1cqRsgHvaa	i am due on the 28th with a midwife app on the 23th aswell ; you will just have the usual urine , blood pressure , doppler and go home - wait till the baby comes naturally ; they will only discuss induction after 10 days or if the baby is to big, etc i am fed up aswell, but i guess stressing is not going to help at all <br>  and about questions, just write down whatever u want to ask( i always forget) <br>  good luck :)))
VCIZJQCJaa	richard yes but cash-what if he doesn't live up to expectations.buy yourself a baby book with names and see what compliments richard?|`|VHHis05Naa	Cash sounds like a porn star name, no offense.

Cassius with the nickname Cash would work.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Cash I would as a middle name or nickname<br>  <br>  Charles and Richard, Cash could be used<br>  Acastus and Richard, Cash for short<br>  Cason and Richard, Cash for short<br>  Cassius and Richard, Cash for short<br>  Caswell and Richard, Cash for short<br>  Lucas and Richard, Cash for short for Lucas(this is cleavor, Lucas and Richard sound good together, both classic names)|`|ODvnyAdlaa	no i dont like that name, this kid in my school was constantly made fun of for that name.

I don't like the name Cash at all.|`|0edad872accfa7019b8218de1c740bcbaa	Richard can also be called Dick.  Just think twice before you choose.

1cYPOJkqaa	Oh no. I'm not even a parent, and you telling me the story line was enough to seriously freak me out. <br>  <br>  And to the two who said they wouldn't send their daughter away: you really think boys are safe where girls are vulnerable? Dear god, I hope you are slightly more careful if you have sons.|`|VHHis05Naa	Just reading your question I know I will never click the link or watch the film.  No thanks.|`|c2kopbo6aa	WTF....I DONT ever want to see that again............<br>  i would choose the boy...only because of the bad things that can happen to a girl..... :(|`|ptRButDmaa	I have seen it - and funnily enough I was thinking of it today. I actually would also have chosen my daughter (I do not have one - this is just hypothetical!) because I would have assumed that she would have been raped many times in such a situation, and I would at least have wanted to spare her that.<br>  <br>  It is absolutely heartbreaking of course - that is the sort of situation that we all dread - I don't suppose there will be another holocaust, but I bet similar things still go on in some parts of the world.|`|4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	Yes, what a film.... I think it scarred me for life!<br>  <br>  It is an unimaginable position that the mother is put in and now you have watched it, you will ask yourself that question so often.... who would you choose.....<br>  <br>  Horrible but a film I don't regret watching - well acted too.  Have a good weep - will do you the world of good!<br>  <br>  :)|`|ODvnyAdlaa	no i havent seen it because i heard the storyline and i think it would keep me awake at night xx|`|yMMcSKvQaa	ive never seen the whole movie but after watching that clip it is pretty sad, i would hate to be that woman... is it a true story ?
0QYIbn1saa	Eli is running, running, running (*sigh!*), climbing, saying about 10 words along with his "made up" conversations that we can't understand, building blocks, playing with trucks and cars, turning pages in his favorite books, starting to use a fork on his own and still learning the spoon thing.<br>  <br>  What a fantastic age!!!!!!|`|xXnFx6qLaa	My boy will be 16 months next week.  :)  I can't believe how much he's talking now!  When he's done with dinner he'll say 'No more Mama' and he's trying to sing songs now... He just learns something new everyday!  I love it!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	everything she isnt suppost to lol <br>  she was soo busy then and know she is almost 21 months now  i love this age dont you
mndpyoV1aa	Jared sounds good. when I hear Ian I think of short fat guy. but you cant do what you want to do. You have to tell the bosses  your real name and fill your paperwork out with your real name. the only people you can lie to about your name is just your co workers.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	i don't like either name but i think jared is the better of the two.|`|xOwafDqYaa	i like jarod.|`|LmlIzdwsaa	Jared !|`|DyTFo9vJaa	i would go with ROB!!!!!|`|A1S4X0DJaa	Jared I suppose. Ian is fine though. I wouldn't go out of my way to chose a new name if I was called Ian because it is average and normal. Thank your mum you weren't called Archibald.|`|TWiOp0xLaa	Most deffinitly Beth :).<br>  <br>  <br>  Nahh, Jared.<br>  Ian reminds me of that stingy get from eastenders, and its a rubbish name... No offence to anyone called that xD|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I think Jared, just by what you're describing yourself as. I love the name Ian though.|`|Gfj24Tb6aa	Jared
Xp2De933aa	first of all, i hope you feel better. i too am TTC and have been sick off and on for the past 3 weeks! defiantly not what i need while ttc! anyways about your question, implantation takes place between 6 and 12 days after the egg has been fertilized, with that being said, if you felt these pains etc, on the 11th,  and ovulated on the 7th, that would only be 4 days after ovulation, which seems a little to soon for implantation. but you could have ovulated a bit sooner than you thought? anything is possible though so keep your head up and test on the 25 and i hope you get the positive result you want! =)<br>  good luck
Rgj6kTOwaa	well yes u cud be pregnant if u had sex on your most fertile day, and te signs do seem to point to pregnancy, but again it all could be that your due on, especially with the stomach cramps! your right waiting a bit to do the test as you might get a false answer, i waited 12 days to do mine lol dont know how i lasted lol! but gud luk huni sending lots of baby dust your way let us knw how u get on :))|`|GxlkhRfoaa	Well it's sounds to be on the 20th was when you ovulated.  I could always tell when I was ovulating by my discharge.  But it is possible.  If you aren't look for your discharge to look like that again and that's def when your ovulating.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	While the signs are promising, you won't know until you do the test.  Good luck.
iMULlxdgaa	thats cute that your so family orientated!  and might I add not that consumer minded because most women just shop whenever with opr with out family.  thats cool that you make it a whole family experience.  I thin  I want to go shopping this weekend and check out IKEA with my friend that has the same due date as me!  Feb. 24th (unless she or I happen to land in the hospital before than)  but it'll be our last big shopping trip if we do before the babies come.|`|OU9xnW86aa	I'm 18w3d and haven't gone baby shopping yet.

I guess you can say all 3 of us. I have a 2 year old and I'm 30 weeks pregnant as well as it's my birthday today. My husband spoils us.|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	I'm going shopping today!! Our 12 mo. old needs a convertible car seat (the one we have now is going to be for his new brother), puzzles, a potty seat, and two new pairs of shoes. Our other son, who will be here soon, is getting a portable crib, a mattress for it, and I'm getting a new baby sling to carry him around in (:<br>  <br>  For me I'm buying a few things I'm going to need when I go to the hospital and when the new baby arrives like nursing pads and maxi pads.<br>  <br>  Oh we're going shopping for new apartments too. A growing family means we need more space...this will have to do until we can get a house.|`|2gyKORCbaa	im not going shopping today as i am stuck in hospital and i am not allowed out|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I haven't started shopping for anything yet, really, since I don't know what we're having. I have clothes from my older kids (boy and girl) but they are totally opposite seasons, so I will need to buy things. While the anticipation is slightly killing me LOL I am looking forward to it! I haven't really bought anything for my labor bag or even thought about packing - I'm 35 weeks so soon but not quite yet - but did buy some toiletries the other day. I've still got mongo pads left over from the last time, so that helps. Probably in a few weeks I'll start packing - I'll never have been so excited to purchase maxi pads in my life! LOL
1bf2f9586d3ad537a73d55b79612e926aa	I expect my children to be independent and true to themselves. To always do what they feel is right for them and above all to be kind.

Honestly, who would want to spend time with people who are constantly putting you down?  Let your parents know that you expect them to be civil and polite or you aren't spending time with them, and that includes being civil and polite to your husband.|`|AA11210211	Well it is hard to say what I would have done if I was in your parents place as I don't know the man you are married to.If they don't like him based on his religion then I think that is wrong and wrong of them for that.I do however see where they are coming from maybe they see something in him that they don't like and don't think it is best for you,but they should be happy and accept it and let you live your life,my children are still young so my expectations of them aren't really appropriate for this situation but I when they are older I expect them to be productive members of society and kind to others,I also expect them to succeed in things that they feel passionate about and never to give up.I do in some ways want them to find a certain kind of mate,I would like them to pass down our values and traditions to their children if they chose so but it is their life and I will let them live it how they see fit.Sit down and talk to your parents and tell them how it makes you feel by them doing this and tell them if they really love you they will accept what you have chosen in life.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	I don';t expect anything...other than that she may hopefully be happy...I have to admit though...I might find it difficult if she were to marry someone who was from what I considered to be an extreme religion....
MFsuN8Doaa	Used correctly, a condom will be all you need. Just make sure your partner is using a condom that is the right size for him, because if he uses a condom that is too big or too small, then you could experiance problems - a sexual health clinic should be able to give him some condoms to try if he has a problem.<br>  <br>  Why the thumbs down? I work for a company that makes condoms, and when you look at the data for condom failure, the biggest root problem is from people using the wrong sized condoms. Everyone is different sized, and a Regular condom might fit one bloke, but not another. <br>  <br>  It's worth being educated about these things.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	For most people, a condom is enough.  However, people can and do have accidents with condoms.  That has to be weighed against the serious side effects of the pill.

Even on the pill and condoms you can still become pregnant.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Used carefully and consistantly, condoms are VERY effective -- but not 100%. So yes, if you're able to use them carefully, (esp. if you can use PlanB as backup) then your odds of having an unplanned pregnancy are extremely low.<br>  (Condoms are about 98% effective used correctly -- which means that out of 100 couples using them, there will be about 2 pregnancies per year. It does NOT mean, and some seem to think, that they break 2% of the time, or that you will get pregnant after 2% of sexual encounters.)<br>  <br>  If that risk is too high, and pills aren't an option, then you might consider using vaginal spermicides as well.  They aren't very effective used alone (about a 20% failure rate!) but are good as an extra bit of coverage with condoms.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	No. Condoms are not enough. My daughter is proof of that.<br>  I'd suggest using something else with it.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Condoms are great but nothing is 100%. My friend and her husband just found out that they are expecting and they used a condom so they are a bit baffled. They didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, had no reason to suspect that it ripped so the doctor said that it was possible that there was a tiny hole that wasn't visible to the naked eye and sometimes it is just a manufacturing flaw. It is rare but does happen. If you really don't want kids right now then you can either double up meaning two types of protection (which still won't be 100% without risk) or refrain from having sex until you don't mind taking that chance. Hope this helped.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	I'm sure ANYTHING is possible, but when the pill and condom are used correctly they are pretty effective on their own.<br>  <br>  I was on the pill for a year and I made sure I took it every single day around the same time.  My husband and I never used condoms and the pill worked 100% for us.<br>  <br>  I decided to stop BC and we used only condoms.  We were very careful and they worked on their own 100% of the time also.<br>  <br>  Then we decided to not use anything and got pregnant on our first try!  Baby #1 is on it's way!|`|AA11853447	Condoms have a higher rate of pregnancy prevention (99%) as opposed to the pill (98%), so it's a good choice to choose condoms. The condoms will work as long as you use them for the whole time you're having sex (not just at the end) and that you use them everytime. <br>  <br>  You don't have to go on the pill too. Some women have complications with the pill and are better off without it. Good luck!|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	condoms are the highest % for protection and if you added the pill well your almost fool proff.. many people have gotten pregnant on the pill alone and a few on condoms breaking. so if you want to be 99.999999999 sure then use both.
dKMBiUPvaa	Whenever there is a chance you might be pregnant it's always good to get checked out with your doctor just in case!! Better to find out earlier than later!! Best of luck to you sweetie!!|`|jLLkSWyiaa	possibly are|`|7QuuVx9naa	are you seriously asking if you could be pregnant when you guys used the pull out method?!  When you have sex, there is this stuff called pre-come, all guys do it.   A little bit of semen comes out, and YES there are swimmers in it.  So pulling out does NOT work.  Yes you could be pregnant.  That could be implantation spotting.  You should take an EPT to find out.  Or go to your docs and get a blood test.
8WRnqs08aa	Has your cycle resumed?<br>  <br>  I would still give a 50/50 chance because the pull out method is not affective 100%, as preejaculate could've been introduced which I hear is just as potent or more than a complete ejaculate.<br>  <br>  My baby was 5.5 months when I got pregnant, so it can happen.<br>  <br>  Good Luck & Baby Dust<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mother of 4 beautiful children with Twins due 09/10/09|`|5yAsj29Vaa	You could be, but it was only "the other night" so way too early for symptoms.  Also, I don't know where people get this from, but going to the bathroom between ejaculations doesn't not reduce the risk of pregnancy, and neither does the pull out method.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Sounds VERY possible to me!|`|d943d3885193abf4e1885268f2764356aa	very good chance!
q1b7170caa	Just remember its only one day that you will be uncomfortable for and then you have a lifetime with your child.  Mine are 20 months apart and I wouldnt change anything.  Enjoy them and Good Luck|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Actually it made it easier for me.  Since I knew what to expect and how it all worked, I was able to stay home as long as possible and wasn't even at the hospital for longer then three hours before my baby was born.  Knowing what to expect helped me deal with it easier and I was able to have an all natural child birth.  I strongly suggest standing and leaning over your bed when you go into labor.  Make sure your belly is hanging and that helps relieve a lot of the pressure in your back.|`|RzYePezkaa	LOL I was when I had my 2nd and let me tell you it was no big deal the 2nd time around did not hurt they kept telling me I needed the epidural so I finally accepted to shut the nurses up but pains were less then with the first because my water broke with first one I had back labor and stomach contractions it was horrible with my 2nd they broke my water but labor was not that bad with my 3rd now I find myself worrying because it has been 2 years between and they said this one was a big baby and I could go early again.|`|ded4210b2d8375997cd6719be107446baa	When i was pregnant with number two i was petrified about the labour. The first time was so long and traumatic, however I was pleasently suprised with the second one. I thought I was hours off giving birth, but then needed to push and half an hour of pushing later arrived my second son. i felt so good afterwards that i was up and about within minutes and felt great. So try not to worry, its usually alot easier second time around. good luck.|`|rV8bRfEkaa	Maybe since I am only 15 weeks and I am having a scheduled c-section... I am actually EXCITED. I am looking forward to the labor and stay at the hospital as a nice BREAK. Someone will watch my son and meals brought to me... I don't even have to get out of bed except to pee. I want to go into labor naturally instead of c-section (my babies are just close together and it will be healthier to have csection because my uterus has not healed completely...) But as time approaches I may start feeling more anxious too! GL and congrats!
zZXRRQS9aa	well if you feel nauseous just get a lemon cut into 4 pieces and suck on the juice and stick the other 3 in the fridge for later it always took away my sickening stomach every time in just a matter of seconds ...it always worked when I was pregnant.  Also of course your body is pumping more blood so your heart is going to beat faster and that will make you feel more anxious..I did the same thing....it was exhausting...just take one breathe at a time and it will be ok...|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	well if you having a serious problem with your anxiety then maybe you should take your meds.. just try cutting the dose, you dont want to stress your body out for the baby, thats even worst.<br>  <br>  and yest i had morning sickness all the way up till 17 weeks. most people stop around 12 though so hopefully it gets better for you.<br>  <br>  i was also extreamly exausted the whole first 3 months and now am feeling so much better. so dont worry it will get better..<br>  <br>  but talk to your doctor about teh lexapro if you are having a problem staying calm|`|B5EgyPlpaa	i do not know what the question is but here is some advise. <br>  <br>  when you are in allot of stress your baby will be born in allot of stress too so just try to relax and get some rest.|`|VkzmH1GKaa	Consult your doctor again,there may be something they can do. may sure you tell them your problems and your concerns for the baby's safety those concerns may be causing your anxiety.|`|YMxuenU7aa	Women handle pregnancy differently.  Some are never sick, some are sick so much in the first three months that they actually LOSE weight.  I would just try to stay in contact with your doctor and let him know your symptoms.....but being sick and tired is very common, especially in the beginning.  It usually goes away in the second trimester - so hang in there!  As far as your anxiety - it's good that you aren't taking medication that could hurt the baby, but make sure you are taking care of yourself too.  Maybe you could see a therapist or have a close friend that you can rely on when you start to get anxious.   Congratulations on your pregnancy!!|`|GxlkhRfoaa	The sickness and horribly vivid dreams are very normal.  Unfortunately I haven't found a cure for the dreams lol.  But for the morning sickness take vitamin B6 25mg 3x a day everyday.  After about 4 days you will notice it starting to work.  It's what saved me.  And also eat 3 normal meals and drink water.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	Being tired is normal. You'll feel really tired the first 3 months as well as the last three months. Rest as much as you can.

cYRZpGkqaa	Yes, it's very important for them to be involved. My mom's relationship with my grandmother was like that. When we were still young, we didn't notice it that much. Once we got old enough to notice and to be there without my mom, she would sit in the car, a lot of times crying. It got to a point where my siblings and I didn't want to go anymore because of all of the hurt it caused our mom. <br>  A few years later, she was put into a nursing home and we went to visit her occasionally. At this point she couldn't shut out my mom anymore. But their relationship didn't mend.<br>  When she passed away, I cried at her funeral not for losing my grandmother then, but for having lost her so many years before she was actually gone.<br>  I'm not telling you what to do, but see if you can make it civil around your children, and maybe your relationship will mend itself in time. Good luck! I wish you the best!|`|VHHis05Naa	If your parents overstep the boundaries at all, you just curb the visits.  Do not let them belittle you in front of your children.  If they are following the rules, let it be.  You sound like a good mother who keeps her children's best interest at the very top of her priority list.  Good for you for being the better person here.  Keep up with the visits as long as your parents treat you respectfully and maintain boundaries.|`|4eTyCuRSaa	In one breath you say they are loving and playful and the next you say you don't trust them.  You need to decide which is the truth. <br>  <br>  If they can't be trusted because they would harm them I wouldn't even consider taking them.<br>  <br>  It's time to stop the silliness and either have a relationship with your parents so your children have their grandparents or... have none at all.<br>  <br>  I hate to use the term silliness but since you don't say what the problem is between you and your parents I can only assume it is so ridiculous that even you don't want to talk about it.|`|AA11616240	I don't know the ages of your sons, but if they notice then they must be old enough to understand that your relationship with your parents is YOURS and their relationships with their grandparents is THEIRS.   Not everyone has to like each other, you love your parents but prefer to remain loving them from afar.  This is all young people need to know.|`|PumDOQC9aa	Don't show your hate towards your parents when your son is spending time with his grandparents .|`|K7H1zrCbaa	dont display your negaitve feelings toward your parents in front of your child.  simple as that.
0ebeadfc05507c25a34209b1ae74798aaa	First round of clomid 50 mg and I did not ovulate even though I thought I did because I had severe side crampings. Secound round was 100 mg and I ovulated on day 16, I know this because I used OPKs and had some minor cramps nothing severe.<br>  If you think you ovulated then take an HPT test 14 days after ovulation for better results.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	It could have been. I ovualated right around day 18-19 when I was on Clomid. Take an HPT two weeks after you think you ovulated and it should be accurate.<br>  <br>  If you don't get your BFP this month, I would urge you to take steps to identify ovulation. I am assuming that your doctor is not monitoring you, so you need to monitor yourself, otherwise you could be taking it for months and not know if you are actually ovulating. You can either use OPK's or chart your temps, but please don't just wait and see what happens every month, because Clomid shouldn't be taken for more than six months in a row, and you can't take it an indefinite number of times. You want to make sure you're making the most of it!|`|ITfBQzg6aa	Hey it wont hurt to try.. Good Luck hun|`|smsUZG4Iaa	Clomid is generally given on days 3-7 or days 5-9 of your cycle. (Three days after your period starts or five days after your period starts) If you are not having a regular period, your doctor may prescribe medication to induce a period. Clomid is taken orally and should be taken the same time each day for five days. If ovulation occurs it is generally a week or so after taking your last dosage of Clomid. you should probably keep a bbt chart or use an ovulation prediction kit to see if you have ovulated. your doctor may also perform an ultrasound to check the number and size of the developing follicles.<br>  i hope this info helps ya.. Best of Luck|`|SbafPUEaaa	I was told that you ovulate 5 days after you complete your clomid. I would think you would have ovulated long before days 18, 19 and 20. That might have been implantation cramping. You know when trying to conceive we feel every little cramp that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. I would just relax and take a test in a few days.|`|iQUeWhb7aa	I don't have an answer to your question but I was always told that Clomid could give a false reading on a hpt..|`|MmQi03oXaa	I didn't ovulate on my first month of clomid, 50 mg days 3-7. I'm currently on cd 19 of my second cycle, this time taking 100mg. I haven't ovulated yet (that I can tell) but I've been temping & using opks.<br>  <br>  I was told by my doctor that you can expect ovulation between 8-13 days after your first pill, so cd 11-16, but I have also heard of women who don't ovulate until cd 23.<br>  <br>  Clomid definitely makes you ovulate later than an average cycle.<br>  <br>  I would say do an hpt a week or two after your cd18. Sounds like the cramping could definitely be ovulation.|`|9osFXKPyaa	WHEN YOU ARE THERE WILL BE SOME CRAMPS THAT IS ONE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS OF THE MEDICINE AND WHEN I WAS ON IT MY DR.

ptpLHJAnaa	If you really are 13, then just please wait a while. I have a kid, and trust me, it seems like it would be fun and enjoyable, but the first few month suck a lot (for both the mom and myself.. moreso on the mom, as she's really grumpy lately...). No sleep, not at night, not during the day, you'll get maybe 4 hours of sleep a day if you're lucky. Your parents would probably disown you. They won't help you at all. The father too. He would probably be forced to get a job, even if he's your age (and he had better be your age... if he's 16 or older, then dump him immeidatly...). Also, your parents may make you go to school still... and actually, worst case, your parent can force you to give up your kid for adoption. There would be nothing worse than to have a kid, and see it be given away to someone else.<br>  <br>  Trust me, it really would be best if you wait at least until you move out of your parents house for a year or so. It would make everything so much easier... even if you have to wait till 18 for that to happen (which you likely will), waiting would be better than your parents forcing you to give up your child.|`|7ZMmQhWraa	Newborn babies do not let you sleep.

I am very glad that I waited this long to have a baby, it gave me time to finish schooling, live a single life and party with my friends, travel around the country and see places that I have wanted to...and work for 10 years in a job that I loved.  <br>  You need to live your childhood, have fun with your friends, study for exams, enjoy going to school and get your diploma.  You won't have much of a life to offer your baby if you have no diploma to back yourself up with.  Your reasons for wanting a baby right now are selfish.  Being a mom has to be selfless.

Who cares about the stupid cats (sorry pet people) get those babies out of there and into homes that will love and support them.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Quite honestly, I really think that they should. But what is the most sad is that if that happens, there’s no way in hell someone can take on ALL 6 kids or ALL 8 kids. And it’s best for those kids to stay together if at all possible. <br>  <br>  I think this woman needs help. She’s got some serious mental issues. And what REALLY gets me is that when custody cases are going on, the number one thing (at least in ours) was “each child needs their own bed/bedroom”. So why doesn’t that apply in HER case? CPS would have already been involved if this was any other incident because you can’t have a total of 17 people (Grandma, Grandpa, Mom, + 14) in a 2 bedroom house. <br>  <br>  I visited her website: I didn't leave money, and I didn't leave a sweet comment either! <br>  <br>  I would love a second child. But my budget doesn't call for it. End of discussion!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	When I see the pictures of her big belly like that, it reminds me of a mama spider carrying her sac of babies on it's back. I can't help but cringe and gag a little bit knowing how uncomfortable she must be...her skin looks stretched to the max...I was upset with the few stretch marks I got with my one child let alone having a belly THAT big.....<br>  <br>  I would NOT donate money to her, she's crazy and wanted this for herself....I'm living paycheck to paycheck, do I get to make a website to ask for money to help me and my son? NO!|`|uLeg1Aniaa	I just threw up a little in my mouth from looking at those pictures.  Disgusting.  I wonder how she can even stand with that belly.  Anyway, its hard to say whether she should take care of those children. I guess if she was able to provide for them and take care of them then yes.  I honestly don't think she can though which makes me want to cry because its ultimately all 14 children that are going to suffer.  If I had the money I would probably donate to her but not money.  I would probably send clothes for the children(tags taken off that way she can't return them for the money).  I wouldn't send money to her because obviously she doesn't spend the money she gets from the governement on what she is supposed to so how do I know she would use it on things for the children.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I don't think foster care is the answer. My wife spent a short stint in foster care (a couple years) and they ran out of room to place her so she had to go to a special ward in juvenille detention (called the "E" wing if curious) it is specifically meant for foster kids that did nothing wrong, but just need a bed to sleep in. <br>  <br>  My guess, is that she is getting a lot more donations then people realize or want to admitt, because she is checking out million dollar homes to buy. She probably will have plenty of money by the time people are done dontaing from around the world. What does confuseme though, is that she is looking at a 4 bedroom house only, yet she has 16 children and her mom living there, I think she's missing a couple rooms there, lol.|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	I think those kids are going to suffer and it makes me sad, because if you look at them, none of them wanted more.<br>  <br>  You know, I'm 36, I have two kids, 8 and 13, and I'll admit, I'd love to have another baby. I really miss my boys being babies. But I don't, and you know why? Because I'm stressed enough with the two I've got, not to mention we can't afford another one, our house isn't big enough.|`|eQFUFAZaaa	I think everyone should leave her alone and mind their own business.  Who gave you the right to condemn her or make her feel bad for doing what she feels is right for her family?  If you are suggesting that she have her children taken away, are you also lobbying for the crack heads and prostitutes to loose their children?  Are you going down into the projects and having the children taken from all the mother's who keep popping them out to get that state aid? <br>  <br>  Why don't you tend to your own problems and leave that woman and her family alone.  It is nosey people like you that provoke others to do stupid crap like camping out on some woman's yard just to get a tabloid shot to decorate you supermarket check out lanes. <br>  <br>  Back off and find a better way to waste your time!|`|o34YHLiraa	I guess if she can pass a state-administered test of psychological well-being and if she can provide for the kids (food, clothes, school, place to live, being a mom, etc) then she should be able to keep them.<br>  <br>  I mean I do not support her decision to have that many kids and frankly I think she's a little batshit but she does technically have as much right as anyone else, which means if she can be sane and keep the kids all safe and sane, then she's got the right to keep them.<br>  <br>  The way I see it, other peoples' reproductive tracts aren't my business, and although there may be some unorthodox situations regarding childbirth and rearing, if no one is hurt then it's not my place to say "eew that's weird and therefore wrong".|`|PumDOQC9aa	.I DON'T THINK SHE NEEDS TO HAVE THAT MANY KIDS .BUT AT THE SAME TIMES ITS NOT RIGHT FOR ANYONE TO TAKE HER BABIES AWAY IF SHE'S A GOOD MOTHER AND ALL. BUT IF SHE'S A BAD MOTHER DEN I CAN UNDERSTAND . THAT'S HER LIFE THAT SHE'S HAVE TO DEAL WITH NOW. .|`|t1fx6kXcaa	At least in those pictures she looks her age.....
q1b7170caa	It sounds like they are getting ready to be born.  You should rest as much as possible as walking may make them move down further and it is too early.  If you have any more contractions, phone the hospital - they may want to take you in and give you drugs to stop labour and strengthen the babies lungs.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	How does lying to your MD benefit you or your baby.  he or she is here to help you lying makes things worst.

STAY IN BED. <br>  <br>   I watched  my sons go through hell.  They both have CP because they were born so early.  They are almost 9 now.

028xaZCeaa	I have always heard when babies are growing they sleep the have spurts where they will sleep a lot, but you say your son has slept like that for months so im not sure if that would apply to your situation. I would probably try to get him to one nap a day around noon or one and then keep him up as long as you can, going to bed at 7 sounds really early to me. My daughter takes one nap around one and sleeps for an hour or two and then is up for the rest of the day till nine or so but she still generally wakes up at night for a bottle (which we are trying desperately to break her from) so in all honestly you are lucky that he is going to bed and sleeping all night even getting up as early as 7. Good luck!|`|tOdjjeAmaa	At that age, my daughter was taking one nap. When she was an infant she would take two per day, but at around 13 or 14 months she only took one. She is now two yrs and has that same schedule. She naps at around noon for an hour or two and goes to bed at 8. She wakes up between 6:45 and 7:30 usually. It's a pretty good schedule. <br>  We decided to give her one nap when she refused to take another one, really.<br>  It could be because he is teething. Or he could be ready to just take one. You could try giving him one nap and see if that helps... I bet he is ready for that change, honestly.|`|PkjZA2o9aa	i say he is prob. cutting more teeth or something. but i honestly dont know.|`|f2ca550ba141680eff4abf0b4511313caa	Sounds like you are doing everything right, maybe he is just at that age aswell as cutting teeth that he just wants to play even though he is tired but he is fighting it more now, all 3 of my kids have been different, my eldest son was always an early riser, my middle son he likes to sleep in, as for my little daugher shes only 5 months so well have to see, Maybe after he gets up at 6 you guys can play for a bit and then you can take a nap too, good luck %-

9e11df00019ad57ae83fd8ebfdfbc709aa	It all depends on the woman.....my cousin was induced super early (36 weeks) because she had diabetes and the baby was already ten pounds.<br>  <br>  Some women get induced so they can have the baby on a certain day (my doctor will not do this).  I was told that if I was two weeks late (carrying the baby for 42 weeks) then I would be induced, otherwise it is not a good idea to do it. Unless it is a planned pregnancy who is to say when you due date is FOR SURE, and how do we know when baby is ready to come out?<br>  <br>  I was induced using pitocin, in a IV drip.  It was very painful, made my contractions start up with a bang----I would have much much much preferred to have it start on its own rather than by artificial means.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I was induced at 41 weeks 1 day with my daughter (still torked it took that long hehe) They put a pill of some sort into my vagina to soften my cervix because it hadn't softened at all and then started pitocin a few hours later. I was admittede at 10am and had my daughter at 1am. (I had to wait 3 hours in between each pill thing and I had 2!) With my son I was 39 weeks 2 days and I went in at 8 am. Started pitocin at 10ish and they broke my water around noon I had my soon at 8:30 thatnight.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	I was 40 wks . They started with pitocin and also  inserted a pill the name escapes me, and I started contractions within a few hours. I went in at 2 and had the baby at 10:45|`|w7FSmSTnaa	i was 39 1/2 weeks with both and they gave me pitocin. i had my first 8 hrs latter and my second 12 hrs latter|`|uVxajsfIaa	I was induced at 40 weeks and 1 day. My daughter showed no signs of planning to come on her own anytime soon and I had very low amino fluid at that point, so my doctor thought it best to induce me.<br>  I came to the hospital on a Wednesday and they started out with vaginal tablets to ripen the cervix. I started to have some mild contractions (in hindsight mild I actually thought at that point that they were the real thing - I was so wrong)<br>  On the next day they put me on the pitocin drip and nothing really happend. So they took me off it again and continued with the tablets in order to ripen the cervix. My doctor told me that unless the cervix was ready the pitocin drip would be useless. Well I will fastforward the rest of Thursday and Friday where I sat in the labour room waiting for labour to start, while all the other women who came in there seemed to leave practically after only 30 minutes with their new babies... The waiting was the worst part of the whole being induced thing.<br>  On Saturday finally labour started and after aprox. 4 hours I had my baby.<br>  With induction it is really like with everything else in pregnancy: No two women are the same and what goes smooth for one is very difficult for another woman. Being induced can make contractions very strong and fast, but others have said that it is not bad at all.<br>  Anyway as with all other 'artificial' things, I would only have it done if it was really necessary and not merely to choose the birthday of the baby. I guess in a normal and complication free pregnancy the baby still is the best judge on when it is ready to come out.|`|m3qSZelkaa	i was induced at 34 weeks but my son had gastroschisis(intestines on the outside) and they used pitocin on me as well. They put the medicine in by IV. However, my labor was much longer. How about 21 hours! It wasn't that bad. I'm glad that they did induce me because I was always worried about going into labor with my husband not there.|`|AA11210211	I was first induced at 41 weeks and then again at 42 weeks,They used a cervadil and pitocin on me.They tried for over 24 hrs each time and neither worked.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is some good info for you to read:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_inducing-labor_173.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_inducing-lab...</a>|`|miPubuDYaa	i was induced ar 37 weeks because the idiot specialist said my daughter was in fetal distress, even though my normal OB/gyn said she wasn't and the hospital agreed she wasn't. All that because i did not want him to do an internal exam(with his hand) on me<br>  <br>  I was given pitocin and 8 hours later i ended up had a c- section because i just wasn't ready at 37 weeks to have her.<br>  <br>  She was born 4lb 11oz and if she would have stayed in the womb her estimated birth weight was gonna be 5.5 -6.5 pounds.

X3rQJhVMaa	She could be getting teeth. For this I would suggest baby motrin for a night. I`m guessing by the screaming a frequent waking up that shes in pain of some sort. So you may want to give her some baby Tylenol or Motrin. Tylenol only works for 4 hours but Motrin works for 6 hours. Make sure shes not cold or to hot. Also make sure her room is super dark.<br>  <br>  Sleeping patterns  change lots with babies. Try giving her a bath a 6:30 and putting her to bed at 7.00.  Baths and messages can be very soothing before bed. I wouldn't purposely wake her up for a feeding. This could throw of her whole eating and sleeping pattern. Let her tell you when she wants to eat.<br>  <br>  Have you let you daycare provider aware that you would like her to take more naps? Does she have a favourite blanket to make napping easier? I would increase her day time naps by half hour - 1 hour then you dont have to put her to bed so early.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|f2ca550ba141680eff4abf0b4511313caa	6.30pm is a really early bed time, maybe you should not put her to bed to sleep until the 8.30 feeding or 9.30 which ever, she is probably coming to the age now where she is really missing you, i see that she goes to daycare, just go with the flow mom, routine really isnt that important, My 5 month old baby girl sleeps through the night she has done since she was 1 month old, i bathe her at 8pm every night bottle directly afterwards, and she sleeps until 7.30 am, however i give her a bottle while she is asleep around 10.30, 11pm.  She stays asleep and i just place her back in her crib.<br>  <br>  <br>  She will sleep if she is tired i wouldnt be worried about her getting what the doctor said, she will get the sleep she needs dont worry.|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	Could be teething.  Try a little Tylenol and see if that helps.  My baby did the same thing at 6 months: frequent waking up, etc.  She was teething.  Good luck.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I would call your doc if it continues usually around 6 moths is when children start getting ear infections. My son wakes up constantly when he has an ear infection.

81b66915f3744172134e7c6c41b7cebdaa	BC is 98% effective when you take it properly (at the same time everyday, and no antibiotics) <br>  <br>  so if you have been talking it properly you should not get pregnant b/c once you start your placebo week (rest week) your egg is already "dead". what BC does is release hormones into your body to make it believe you are already pregnant that way it doesnt release an egg into your uterus , and it thickens your cervix fluid to make it harder for sprem to get through.  Once your start placebo pills/rest week your body realizes you are not pregnant and starts to break down the uterus lining that was and your period begins but there should not be an egg in your system b4 that to be fertilized|`|Yn2n26zXaa	If you are standing, sitting, leaning, bouncing, yelling, on birth control, on your period, in bed, in the tub, on the moon or in a bus... YOU CAN GET PREGNANT. Period. Don't have sex if you can't handle an unwanted pregnancy. I'm not being nasty, just honest. The only way to 100% protect against pregnancy is not to have sex. THE ONLY WAY. So, either stop having sex or learn to accept the fact that you could get pregnant. I got pregnant during my period while on BC and using a condom. It does happen.|`|73808e403987212ba673162fcda0802daa	It depends on how long you were on this BC. It takes about 3 weeks before your body gets used to it (I've read) so if you were in the middle of a switch, I imagine you could get pregnant.|`|Rgj6kTOwaa	erm if your on BC then prob not no, im not sure if you mean during your 7 day break can you get pregnant is this what u mean?? then on most pills no you cant as you are still protectd, but if you have been on so many different forms then best thing is to go bak to your doctor and ask them the exact outlines of when you are and arent protected just to make sure hun x|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Birth control is supposed to suppress ovulation, so even on the days where you are not taking active pills, you are protected.  However birth control is not 100% effective so you could still get pregnant on them.|`|AA10972821	I don't know when your ovulation cycle is but I DO know that you can get pregnant while on birth control- that's how I got my little girl!!
vTfEYeKQaa	If your period is late, you can probably take a test and get an accurate result. Things could just be delayed from switching birth control methods.  Take a test anyway to ease your mind. More than likely it's just from switching birth control.|`|uuHPneEcaa	it might be an irregular period. but I mean u could take the test to see. CAUSE u dont wanna mess around on this situation|`|GXm20LUKaa	I think your just having an irregular period since you switched over to the pill, don't stress out about it. But just to calm yourself you could go out and buy a test if you like it's up to you. Good luck :)|`|qM1qoDhCaa	Just go out and buy a test, the cheapest will do. It is the only way to know for sure. The dollar store test are just as accurate as anything else.|`|Rgj6kTOwaa	no if u have got your period then i very much doubt you are pregnant!! it will just be an irregular period as you kind of disrupted the normal birth control thats all! if you are late next month then do a test but i think your pretty safe this time :)|`|R5od6HRBaa	It's probably just an irregular period due to switching birth control..but if you are that worried, just go buy a test to put yourself at ease:)|`|Dp1Oku2vaa	i would say its an irregular period due to changing to the pill, if you were pregnant you wouldn't get your period at all. take at test anyway to put your mind at ease but im sure there's nothing to worry about
Ccq8zEcnaa	Call your doctor, it might be your mucous plug.
oA8Rtyxuaa	it all depends, some women don't get their period while breastfeeding. have you talked to your doctor about it? im not sure if you are supposed to be on bc while nursing? I got the mirena, i had it while nursing, but it doesn't release any hormones. I have had it for almost 4 years now and i never got my period back! yay! i think its pretty awesome and it lasts for 5 years. heres a link if you are interested!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mirena-us.com/index.jsp?WT.srch=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.mirena-us.com/index.jsp?WT.sr...</a>|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	not necessarily- sometimes it will still not come- i was on BC pill for a little while and nursing and i still didn't get mine- i  got mine back when my son was 9 months<br>  <br>   i started taking the mini pill when my son was 5 weeks and then didn't get a period until 9 months do i think other women getting their period is just circumstancial|`|rAkWoweOaa	If you get on birth control pills, your period will come back post haste! Mine did the first cycle I started them after the birth of my son. It has to come back eventually, it is just unfortunate. lol|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	It did for me.  I went on the "mini-pill" which is safe for nursing moms.  I started my period right away.  <br>  <br>  Just wait until it returns and then start.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	My doctor wouldn't let me start the pill again until after I got my first period.  He wanted to make sure that my "system" started functioning properly again until he put me on birth control.  I'm not sure what would happen if you started birth control before you got your period.  It may trigger it to come back with the fluctuation in hormones.|`|AA10645637	My son just turned 7 months and I breastfed him exclusivly until he was 6 months and I have been back on a "regular" birth control pill since, I still haven't gotten a period yet. Im not complaining either but boy its weird not knowing when its going to show up!|`|AA11210211	I have been on BC pills since I was 13 and I am now 25 and I have always had a period,so I would say yes,there are however certain types of pills that make you not bleed or have one every so often.|`|zQWNb6neaa	I started the mini-pill (safe for breastfeeding) at 2 weeks postpartum after my son was born and I did not get my period back until he was 9 months old. It is not the same for every mom, and breastfeeding alone will delay the return of your menstruation regardless of your using birth control or not as long as you are doing it exclusively and have not introduced solids yet.

I was very upset all of her clothes were name brand in in excellent condition. I now sell them on e-bay or have a yard sale. Kid to kid is not worth it.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Their goal is to make money. They have to pay rent and employees and taxes and insurance and such with the profit, so they are giving you as little as possible.<br>  <br>  If your plan is to turn around and buy some clothes there today you might walk out of the deal happy.

I am sure it is frustrating, but be patient, laugh at how silly it can be, and in time maybe she will get over it.|`|GXm20LUKaa	My sister is asking the same thing about her 5 year old boy Lol.

L2IU8kNTaa	getting free formula is not a good excuse for bottle feeding...obviously breast milk is free, too. <br>  I have never encountered anyone who has called breastfeeding disgusting. How do they think the human race survived before formula? <br>  Congratulations on offering your child the very best. I think you have made a wonderful choice and it shows that you're a great mama already for being determined to stick it out for your baby's benefit. It may hurt in the beginning (many say it shouldn't, but it does for some, and did for me) but you can get through that time by realizing that in a couple months, when it becomes really easy, you'll have it made. No washing/sterilizing bottles in the middle of the night. No worries about bringing enough food w/you when you go out. It's all right there, ready to be eaten, at just the right temperature! :) And it really becomes an amazing bonding time.<br>  If you pump and feed, your baby is still exclusively breastfed. That term means baby's food is only breast milk. <br>  I'm sorry to say it, but people who think breastfeeding is gross, whether in private or in public, are ignorant. They should become much better educated on the subject before making that judgment. They wouldn't be here today if their ancestors believed that!|`|KWaTVVpGaa	Don't listen to them! It is a wonderful thing to breastfeed your child. You form a special bond that you don't get from a bottle. It will feel uncomfortable at first but it gets better. Then, there will be no pain. There is nothing gross about feeding your baby.<br>  <br>  Good for you!|`|Ye88kT6Uaa	I am 23 and have a 4 year old and a 2 year old and I breastfed them both.  I didn't feed in public as I didn't feel comfortable but I have seen women who have.  When my husband and I would go out to eat I would pump and take a bottle with me.  It does hurt some (mostly sore nipples and chapped skin make it tender) but you don't think about that because you are giving your child nourishment..its not like excrutiating or horrible like the women said.  You are doing the right thing for your child and pumping and feeding through a bottle is just as good!  So go for it and stay away from those women who put you down...you are about to start the best thing you will ever experience in your lifetime!  Good luck!! :)|`|eldgxVPFaa	My wife and I decided she would breastfeed since mother's milk is ideal for humans (cow's milk is for cows). She did so for our three children. We pumped for the first, but she resigned to be a full-time mother after. (My wife went back to work after our youngest reached primary school age.)<br>  <br>  I have a friend, a professor at Duke University, who adopted a child. She was so sold out on breastfeeding that she was able to stimulate herself and breastfeed. I understand quite a number of adoptive mothers do that.<br>  <br>  In my country breastfeeding is encouraged at all hospitals and formula milk discouraged as a matter of policy. I think your ideas are really admirable.<br>  <br>  Go, girl!|`|oZEPi0nuaa	A lot of people are against it. I breastfed my baby! I did it simply because it was the best thing for her! I was uncomfortable with breastfeeding, but I did it because of how much better it is then formula. Not that I have anything against formula! <br>  It's hard when people around you don't understand, and don't support you! Try not to let that discourage you! You know you're giving your baby the best! All the best to you!<br>  JG|`|ANHsv4ENaa	This site has great support. Those women sound ignorant and insecure. Ignore them and surround yourself with people who support you. You know you are doing what's best for your baby.|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	I don't think this is a common reaction.  These women may feel threatened in a way by your choice...they know breastfeeding is best and have chosen to not even give it a try.|`|vue9NOhYaa	I don't think it's a particularly common reaction, but obviously some people feel that way. Just ignore them and continue to do what's best for your baby and your life.|`|0ZfZulnzaa	Breast feeding is a very natural process, I have breastfed all 3 of my children and still breastfeeding my 20 mos old daughter. I commend any mother who chooses to breastfeed and I commend any mother who chooses to bottlefeed. We all have our own reasons for why we do the things we do. It is not my place to tell anyone what they should do in regards to their own child.  Whatever a mother chooses to do in regards to feeding her child, it is her choice and I don't think anyone should criticize her. <br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with pumping  your milk to feed to  your baby, the longer your baby gets breast milk the better it will be for your baby. Do not let anyone make you feel bad for wanting to breast feed or for breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  Breastfeeding in public I agree completely with you, discreet and with respect for yourself. When I have had to feed my daughter in public when she was younger I would cover myself just for the fact I do not appreciate other people giving me the look, and it makes it more comfortable for all concerned. Most of the time they do not even know what you are doing. I would never take her into the bathroom to feed her, but if there was a mothers room available and it was clean I would go there, it is more relaxing.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	no but welcome to the westernized world- people in america are just nasty.( i am american) i personally don't associate myself with people who think that way. it's one thing to choose something differently but to belittle and call someone nasty is ignorant. my best friend is a bottle feeder andd she's one of my biggest supporter in fact she often come to me with advise since she wants to nurse her next child. she openly admit she was afraid when she had her first, hasn't known anyone who breastfed, was afraid of failure. IMO if i were you i would shove it in their face and be damn proud. breastfeeding was something that made me feel proud and that i accomplished something every day. People like this have a lack of education so excuse them and be about your way. BTW if breastfeeding hurts terribly then your baby is not latched right adn that is something that can be fixed. i still nursing my 22 month old and i worked he got nothing but breastmilk- i pumped until he was a year old- when i was not at work he was only on the breast. i alos breastfed anywhere i wanted to be and if someone didn't like it then they could feel free to cover their head or leave the room or go to the bathroom- i never got comments though when i was nursing in public. most people either didn't notice or smiled.<br>  <br>   BTW- you CAN eat thigns like broccoli and chocolate and garlic while nursing- the biggest culprit to tummy problems would be dairy<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/food-sensitivity.html#watch" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/foo...</a>|`|iH2whFkHaa	I think most people don't think it's nasty, although there is a wide variety of attitudes about breastfeeding...I have gotten weird looks simply because I kept breastfeeding past a couple months old. Then there are those weirdos who think breastfeeding spoils the baby. There's a lot of stupid ideas about breastfeeding out there. <br>  <br>  Of course I do not agree with them; I think they are being tacky and rude. They can do whatever they like with their babies but they shouldn't force their ideas on you.<br>  <br>  Also exclusively breastfeeding means the only thing the baby eats is breast milk. It doesn't matter if it's in a bottle or not.<br>  <br>  ***oh and breastfeeding in public is bound  to get you lots of dirty looks and comments when you go about it. I 100% believe it's the  mother and baby's right to breastfeed in public but I think that most people think it's rude and don't like it so be prepared to be on the receiving end of some rude comments.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	The opinion on breastfeeding has a lot to do with a persons maturity level. The benefits to breastfeeding are so amazing for both baby and mother that I can't believe everyone wouldn't at least want to try, If you have someone working with you then you may never experience any pain with breastfeeding. <br>  It is proven that less educated a person is the lower their chance of breastfeeding is.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	It sickens me that women think breastfeeding is nasty, wtf that thought is nasty.  It's funny how an artificial nipple and bottle (which have BPA warnings) is the "norm" and breastfeeding is such a shock.  Thank God I never ran into anyone who acted grossed out or oddly surprised that I nursed my daughter but I did some some reaction when I was "still" nursing past a few months old.  It didnt bother me in fact it made me feel sorry for the ignorant people and their babies.  I never pumped and bottle fed, I nursed in public WITHOUT a blanket or nursing cover, I had nothing to be ashamed of, there is no reason to bottle feed when out and about.  My advice, just ignore those women because they obviously know nothing about breastfeeding, you are doing the best thing possible for you baby and that's all that matters.|`|AA10615926	I am sorry but they sound really uneducated and misinformed to me!  No I do not agree with them, they are wrong!  It is fine to pump and give by bottle if you need to be away from your child, they are still getting breastmilk and that is what matters.  I think it is great that you want to give your baby the best possible, formula is no where near as good as your milk!  Also there is nothing wrong with nursing in public, I have done it many times very discreetly.  Don't listen to them...they don't know what they are talking about!|`|Q7jMH5praa	I don't agree with those women at all. BF is the most natural thing a woman can do for her baby. I BF my son for 6 weeks before stopping and had people react that way to me too. Mainly my brother. He was the main reason my sister-in-law didn't BF. He say breast milk looks like horse ***. I don't want to know how he knows what that looks like. Keep your head up and just know that your doing the best thing for your little one. Good luck.|`|UghJ0XROaa	Most people don't react that way about other people doing it, but don't feel comfortable with it themselves. I don't understand that feeling, but it's not my place to tell someone they have to love breast feeding. But basically the women that thinks it's gross, don't normally think that other people doing it is gross, they just can't stand the idea for themselves.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Yes if your baby is getting breastmilk, you are breastfeeding. I consider myself breastfeeding even though i work everyday and my daughter gets expressed milk while i am gone.|`|bVkIEpyGaa	While everybody is free to chose their own methods of feeding their child, criticising somebody for their choice is just not on. Breast milk is breast milk whether it is from a breast or a bottle and it still offers the same nutrition and health benefits. I much prefer to see a baby being breast fed in public than being bottle fed. Also any pain should only be an initial thing, and once you are through it you seriously will not regret choosing to breast feed. <br>  <br>  You go girl. These neighbours seem ill informed and very judgmental|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Depending on where you live (I am guessing you live in the Southern US) depends on what percentage of people think breastfeeding is gross, think its normal, or don't care one way or the other.<br>  <br>  It shouldn't hurt if you are doing it right, though it can be a bit achy like if you overuse a muscle.<br>  <br>  Its best not to use bottles, there are other ways of feeding a baby if you aren't there.  Depending on your definition of exclusively breastfeeding depends on whether its only "from the breast" or only breastmilk (no vitamins, supplements, water, tea, etc).<br>  <br>  I think you are going to need thick skin to nurse where you live.<br>  <br>  There may be laws to help you:<br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/Law/Bills36.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/Law/Bills36.html</a>|`|s6qgkfLxaa	Don't listen to people, we've become such a .. weird.. country when it comes to taking care of your child. <br>  <br>  I breastfed my daughter for a year, and believe me, I got a lot of weird and RUDE comments from my daughters family at least. I never used a bottle especially when she was newborn and her dad's mother was EXTREMELY opinionated when it came to that.<br>  <br>  Yes, sometimes it does hurt. Like the first few days with my son it was very painful but I got used to it. <br>  <br>  I might have gotten a lot of rude looks/comments/suggestions but let's face it.. their kids were sick constantly and I have NEVER gone through a single ear infection, she was sick one time when the flu went around, but never got a cold like her cousins who lived with us did, and she NEVER had constipation, or any bowel movement problems.  I never even had to experience colic, ever.<br>  <br>  My mother breastfed and she had problems but she also ate things she wasn't supposed to while breastfeeding. example: Steamed broccoli, large amounts of chocolate, garlic, ect.<br>  <br>  As for breastfeeding in public, I think it's natural and beautiful and there is nothing to be ashamed of. My mom breasted in public with everything "hanging" out though- for two years. And I found that inappropriate and weird. She got a lot of rude looks too.<br>  <br>  I breastfed with the blanket over my shoulder in public and I never had any problems with strangers though.
smsUZG4Iaa	ok i gotta warn you this is gonna be long... ok here i go.<br>  figure out when your next period is due to begin and count back 12 to 16 days. This will give you a range of days when you will probably be ovulating. For women with a 28-day cycle, the 14th day is often the day of ovulation. To use this method, you must know how long your cycle usually lastshe best way to determine your most fertile time, though, is to pay attention to your body and learn to spot the signs that ovulation is imminent.<br>  <br>  Change in cervical mucus. As your cycle progresses, your cervical mucus increases in volume and changes texture. The changes reflect your body's rising levels of estrogen. You are considered most fertile when the mucus becomes clear, slippery, and stretchy. Many women compare mucus at this stage to raw egg whites.<br>  <br>  Normally the mucous is a protective barrier, but during the most fertile time of your cycle, it allows sperm to get through the cervix, up to the uterus, and then to the fallopian tubes for a rendezvous with your egg.s a woman approaches ovulation, her estrogen increases, causing her cervix to become soft, high and open, and producing a very wet, fertile quality cervical fluid. A fertile cervix feels like your lips: soft and somewhat mushy. A handy mnemonic to help you remember this concept is the word SHOW, for Soft, High, Open and Wet. Right after ovulation, under the influence of progesterone, all the above signs reverse. That is, the cervix becomes firm, low and closed, and the cervical fluid dries up. An infertile cervix feels more like the end of your nose.<br>  The changes in the cervix are what is referred to as a secondary fertility sign, as opposed to the two primary fertility signs -- waking temperature and cervical fluid. Primary fertility signs are those signs that all ovulating women experience all of the time, whereas secondary fertility signs are those which only some women experience, or only experience some of the time.<br>  ok thats all i can think of at the time.. i hope this helps you..

7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Hi there.  Sorry for your loss, I have been there.<br>  You would bleed for the first few days...stop, then it will be brutal bleeding for a few more days.  Mine was hell, with cramping and everything.  I felt like ****.  <br>  I believe you were not to have sex for 2 weeks though because you run a high risk of infection.
92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	TALK to your OB and Psychiatrist, please, before you stop taking anything!  Also, I would caution you against attempting getting pregnant while on all these drugs.   I was on a small dose daily of Prozac for anxiety when I conceived our son (with my doctor's approval) and some asthma meds, and my new perniatologist says that it is quite likely that the Prozac caused my son his major heart defects, and some other problems (he looked like he had a syndrome of some kind, but as far as they could tell, his microchromosomal tests were perfect!)  He never came home from the hospital before he died.   <br>  <br>  I did withdraw off of prozac (as long I am doing "okay" I can stay off, and my perinatologist is very supportive of this) and am now trying to conceive again.   I am also taking prescription prenatal vitamins,  with lots of extra folic acid, because that can help prevent cardiac defects, too.|`|qw1Lkpvgaa	My suggestion is to talk to both your OBGYN and your psychiatrist. It is important that you weigh the risks and benefits of taking medications while ttc and during the pregnancy and that your OB and your psychiatrist work together to figure out the best plan for you and your baby. I am not familiar with all the medications you are taking, but I know some medications can cause birth defects. (I am currently on multiple anti-depressants and although am not ttc I have done some research on this in case I do get pregnant by accident.) I wish you the best of luck. The pregnancy will be rough without medication, but it will be worth it in the end.|`|F3BRG72iaa	well if you are trying to conceive i think it be best you do it while your not taking anything just so your baby can have less chance of being miscarried. good luck and lots of baby dust to you.|`|vue9NOhYaa	This is definitely something to discuss with your doctor.  He will explain the risks and benefits of taking the meds during pregnancy vs. stopping them, so you can make an educated decision.
Ccq8zEcnaa	It's called discharge. Actually the scientific term is leukorrhea. It's normal in pregnancy, and will last the entire pregnancy. It should be a white milky discharge, without an odor. Should you find this discharge changes in color, say greenish or brownish or blood tinged or pink, call your doctor. Otherwise, it's just your body's way of preparing your insides for your baby's big debut.|`|V7sfV5odaa	Could be the mucus plug!  call the doctor now|`|uVxajsfIaa	Maybe a yeast infection? Is there also any itching or burning?<br>  Even if not you should have it checked out by your doctor (sometimes you can have infections without the itching and burning), while you are pregnant you are A LOT more prone to infections of the vagina or the urinary tract.<br>  But during pregnancy you will also experience an increase in 'normal' discharge, but if I recall correctly that is later on in pregnancy. <br>  So, my advice is: Get it cecked out by your doctor.<br>  Having a yeast infection or urinary tract infection is pretty comon during pregnancy and, although you should have it treated promptly, is not something to get overly worried about.|`|ec926f1f376353e334871dac09156d63aa	Sounds normal to me. If you're grossed out by it try wearing some pantyliners.
q7sgWqZ3aa	It's not a question on unemployed or not, its about HOW much you two make. He can have a job and you still get medicaid, depending on how much he makes and how much your living and all that costs are.<br>  <br>  You'll need to go to your state's medicaid website and find out all the available there.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	If you are both unemployed yes you are eligible.  BUT if your husband does get a job during your pregnancy you will lose it.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i payed in for yrs as well as my hubby we waited till insurnace was there|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	You might. You can always call your local human services department and ask someone about it they will tell you whether it's worth it to come in. We applied in Iowa for it for help in paying for our sons bills because although we have health insurance that we pay for EVERY month, the insurance only covers 1 "preventive" exam a year. They consider immunizations and well baby checks as preventive. It is only fro children until age one because of our income level ($55,000) but it helps alot with the huge bills we get!|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Check the eligibility requirements with your local health department or human services office before you get pregnant.  Remember that their are limits on assets as well as income to qualify.  For example, I started a small business this year and am showing a loss rather than income.  However, I would not qualify for such a program because I own real estate.  Be sure to check out your options thoroughly.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	She is probably "reverse cycling" to a degree.  Which is to say she is probably not eating much when you aren't around and is making up for it when you are together -not just the breastmilk but also the close contact.  Most babies do this, at least to start.<br>  <br>  Do keep an eye on her to make sure she is still peeing, gaining, etc and for signs of nipple confusion which could lead to her not getting enough from the breast.<br>  <br>  She should settle down to a degree once she gets used to the new schedule.

My son was like this for a couple months, then he got more into things and active and slowed to a more normal routine. By around 9 months he only nursed 3 or 4 times a day.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	Sounds like cluster feeding which means a growth spurt.|`|9IFF0vIoaa	Usually, you can tell if she is actually nursing and swallowing milk.  She might just be pacifying herself...My second baby did that.  At her age, she doesn't really "miss" you.  It's an out of sight, out of mind thing.  She doesn't really remember that you exist until she sees you again.<br>  <br>  Growth spurts also cause frequent nursing...she might be ready to have one!<br>  <br>  If she's just pacifying, she may be trying to comfort herself from not being with you during the day...or she is just getting to an age where she wants to be pacified.  I was sort of anti-pacifier until my second child.  She wanted to nurse all the time...but not necessarily EAT all the time.  So one time I popped a pacifier in, and she was fine.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	Way to go mom. Breastfeeding and working is a challenging job. <br>  At 3 months the baby should nurse 8-10 in a 24 hour period. Some babies do not drink as much when they are away from mom so they will make it up when mom is nearby. How much does she eat at daycare? She should be eating around 6 ounces every 2-3 hours. If she isn't eating that much then she is trying to get it in when you are home. This is normal. Continue to feed her. <br>  Ways to tell if she is getting enough - wet diapers (at least 6), gaining weight, and should be able to go at least an hour between feedings. SHe may also be going through a growth spurt as well. How are you doing when pumping at work?|`|959ad44e37da1dfd2d46c54b82c1535faa	I went got back to work when my little girl was 2 months. I was doing the same thing . She will cry and I used to nursed her all the time. But then I started producing a lot of milk , because my body was thinking that she needs more than she will take. I had so many problems with milk plug ducts. So know I try to feed her every 3 hours from each one . One at the time. And I pump also. She is 7 months.<br>  <br>  Good luck!. <br>  And good for you for breastfeeding.|`|AA11819133	Its good to breast feed her whenever you are at home. When she sleeps during breast feeding that's mean she takes enough feed.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	She's probably going through a growth spurt. A nurse once told me "3 weeks, 3 months, 3 years." So that might be it. <br>  <br>  Lots of regular wet diapers are a good indication that she's getting enough. She probably also does enjoy being close to you, too. Don't worry!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	if she's having enough wet diapers she is getting enough. she's most likely just wanting more time with you. my son did it too. as soon as i got home from work he needed to nurse right away even though he had just had some breast milk in a bottle. it's normal. also, it's good for your supply. supply can down when you go back to work because a pump isn't the same and her nursing a bunch is good for your supply. anyway, you should try getting sling and  wearing her so you can get more things done<br>  <br>   at that age my son did miss me it's not a out of site out of mind thing- he knew the breast hatedd the bottle and only took it because he had to he wanted to nurse off of me
Sz8KiJuvaa	my 2 month old daughter had the same problem this past week. she was congested and coughing and they diagnosed her with RSV. which has cold like symtoms. there really isnt any way to guard against it since its the season for it and we had winter babies lol. and at two months they cant do anything for it. the doctors told me that if her nose was congested to use saline drops and asperate before feedings so she didnt have a hard time sucking on bottle. and to do it before bed. also run a humindifier to help out if it seems really bad. i have been sleeping her in her carrier as well to help with draining everything down and helping her sleep better while shes not feeling well....basically just keep an eye on it, if he gets a temp or stops feeding and such take him to the er other then that it basically has to go away on its own. i know it sucks and i worried like crazy at first too but just keep an eye on it and it should all be ok. hope this helps!|`|pXSKSS3daa	Unfortunately, no, not at two months.<br>  <br>  If he seems congested at all you can try a humidifier or sit in the bathroom with him while a hot, steamy, shower runs.

I would often suggest directed meditations (where someone gives you images to follow in your mind through the meditation) for my moms who had terrifying and vivid dreams. Any record story (or even i-tunes) probably has some good baby-centered or peace-centered guided meditations that would work when something like this happens.<br>  <br>  Also know that having vivid, sometimes terrifying, dreams is normal in pregnancy, and may relate to bursts of hormonal activity impacting the brain centers.

It can stunt growth, coffee yellows teeth, it really has no benefit.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I started drinking tea at 9 [but only a couple times a year]. I drank coffee at 11.|`|6RGnG1ukaa	I have three girls ages 2, 4, and 6. My 6 year old drinks tea. Decaffeinated tea, tea is actually good for you. I control the amount of sugar and milk that she puts in it but it is good for you. Coffee I'd say about 15 with occasional treats over the age of 10. Just make sure the coffee is decaffeinated. Be careful with too much coffee under the age of 15 because you could stunt their growth.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	I'd give my kid tea at any age after 1. Not a lot, not every day. I drink sweet tea, and I don't really see a problem with it except the sugar and caffeine. So I'd limit it for my kids until they were like 8 maybe. Coffee... I started drinking when I was 11, almost every morning. I will probably let my kids drink some when they are 13 or so. It doesn't stunt growth by the way, but they don't need all that caffeine.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Most probably would say it doesn't matter. Kids are already getting a huge amount of caffeine from cokes,so what's the difference?<br>  But personally. I'd say for coffee,should wait until high school,tea on the other hand. Over two years of age under direction of a doctor.|`|WoxMH0wZaa	haha I started drinking iced tea when I was like in the first grade haha.

I would say an occasional cup is OK around 10 or so.  My mom let my brother and I have an occasional cup of coffee when were about 10 or so.  We never finished a cup because we did not like the taste that much, but we wanted to be like our parents and be grown up.<br>  I would not think it would be OK for them to drink it all the time until they are about 16.<br>  <br>  The caffeine is bad for them, but some parents let kids drink caffeinated pop so young and don't think about the caffeine in that.|`|AA10609634	Regularly? Or occasionally?<br>  <br>  I knew of a family that all the kids drank coffee, from 4years old and up.  They all seemed to turn out ok. <br>  <br>  But I would think 13 should be the youngest dailiy coffee drinker. <br>  <br>  And, no, it doesn't stunt your growth.  That is an old wives tale. <br>  <br>  I started drinking coffee daily when I was in High School.  Stopped while in college, started again when I went to work.  No biggie.|`|Kg2bRyVCaa	There are no serious side-effects to drinking tea other than a mild laxative effect if too much is taken. Giving your children half a cup is certainly not going to help them - and will cause less harm than showing them that certain foods/drinks are off-limits.|`|LQKW39SEaa	i know 2 year olds drinking tea<br>  what's wrong with sweet tea?><br>  is there anything wrong with it?<br>  <br>  <br>  and i don't drink coffee...it's nastee|`|wp13cYvHaa	ive drank tea most of my life since about 5.<br>  but very weak tea.<br>  i started drinking coffe at 12.<br>  <br>  for younger kids perhaps give them hot chocolate instead.|`|RJRiy9oMaa	I started at 3...yeah my babysitter also worked in a coffee shop.lol.

I actually got paid my regular pay b/c of bedrest at 35 wks, which falls under FMLA.  I then got 6 weeks maternity leave, technically short term disability.  So all in all, I got 12 weeks of pay for not working (at least not at the office).  The tax breaks, which really aren't that great, don't come into play until after the baby is born.|`|XmEqZfjaaa	Unfortunately, no tax credits. Glad that you are getting maternity pay, though. It probably falls under your short term disability.  I am not getting anything, except what vacation I have accrued.  Count yourself as blessed :)

AA11764194	During my last pregnancy after I confirmed it.. I had rather unusual very heavy bleeding.. I thought I am having miscarriage.. but took another test and the result was still positive<br>  <br>  went to my Gyno.. since it was just 5 weeks  we did not see anything.. but blood work came positive.. on 6th week we saw small sac and 7th week a small heart beat.. <br>  <br>  I hope you did not had miscarriage , so  just wait for the blood results.. Good luck..|`|mbvpWNMeaa	It sounds like you had another miscarriage.  Sorry you had to go through that.|`|c3eb9cc5af710aa695ddf32e0b5e463aaa	Like your midwife, I would recommend that one of my moms going through this get a blood result so that we can get a better picture of what's going on. It sounds like you might have had an early miscarriage... but one thing you need to know is that many women have early miscarriages, and even miscarry multiple times, and still go on to have healthy pregnancies.<br>  <br>  For much of human history, women didn't track their cycles so obsessively, and a missed period or two wasn't considered a big deal, and most women went through early miscarriages of babies that they didn't even know they were carrying. Nowadays, we are really focused on our fertility, and we know, sometimes to the day, when pregnancy is a possibility, so we're a lot more aware of these early incomplete attempts at generating a new life. Rest assured that even if this -is- an early miscarriage, many many women have miscarriages and it doesn't impact their ability to have babies later on.<br>  <br>  (I had 6 miscarriages and 2 stillbirths before my firstborn, and several miscarriages between my firstborn and my 2nd. It was only with my 3rd that the decision to get pregnant and a first-catch pregnancy connected. Most of the women that I cared for as a midwife had at least one miscarriage before 'catching' and still went on to have healthy full-term babies.)
1uAduUKhaa	Potty training little boys can be fun and so cute.   I found it best to remove the boys diaper a short time after he has eaten or had something to drink and dress him just a t-shirt and let him play 'bare bottom'.  Keep an eye on him and when he starts to hold his Petey or show signs having to tinkle, bring him to the potty have him aim with both hands.<br>  <br>  I have put Cheerios in the potty which makes it fun for the child to aim as he tinkles and it is so cute to watch too.   But try this too.... squirt a little dish washing liquid into the potty water and have him make bubbles !    Don't be surprised if his aim goes off the mark while you and he laugh !|`|yKS2UI87aa	Throw a couple of cheerios in the toilet and tell him to aim at them. You can make it a game if he hits this one it's this many points and so on. You can also try the reward system with stickers and let him put them on a special calendar or an m and m, not the whole bag just one. I personally like the stickers. Good luck|`|BrYMh9pRaa	I never go for this Cheerios stuff. To get a small guy to pee standing up, you have to take the matter in hand and hold it for him and aim into the bowl and explain what you are doing. It doesn't always go where you point it, but mostly its OK, and he can learn.That is the best way to get him to use the toilet like a big boy and the rest should follow quite quickly.|`|gK9NlMXcaa	Are there any boys maybe 5 or 6 years old around him?  I had a difficult time with my sons too! The breakthrough came, when I moved in with my sister and she had a son about 7. You know boys like to be like their kind. So whenever my nephew went to the bathroom, I sent my son. With a little of my help, it didn't take long.|`|cu8fUJbMaa	For some reason, boys are always harder! My girls trained very easily and both boys were a challenge. With the first, way back in the early 80's. I tried the potty chair. That was a disaster. The poor kid would end up peeing all over himself or else sit there for 10 mins. and get up and wet his pants. I finally followed someone's recommendation to sit him on the regular potty backward--where he could hang on to the tank if he felt insecure on the big potty. I placed a small bowl of plain M&M's on the tank and he could eat the M&M's while he went potty. The key is that this is the ONLY time they get the M&M's. If he was successful in going potty like a big boy, he got to take the bowl with him and finish them. We progressed from sitting backward to standing on a  wide, sturdy step stool He was literally potty trained in a matter of days, as was my second boy with the same procedure. Back then they didn't have the little potty seats that sit in the big toilet like they do now, but I think using one of those in addition would really improve success!
peQGGFPYaa	First off congrats on losing all your baby weight in 3 weeks that would be a dream come true for me i was still struggling to lose all mine a year later and now im pregnant again! haha.<br>  <br>   Bio- Oil is really good you can get it from walgreens i wouldnt buy it right now because they will start to fade very quickly on their own and then i would use the bio oil to help them disappear even more.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	They fade slowly over time. Hydrate your skin and maybe by the end of summer they will have faded a bit. They never go away though unless you resort to lazer treatments.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Over time they will get alot lighter and you can use all those so called creams but none of it will take them away. The only thing to take them away is a tummy tuck my dear witch is very costly and i wouldnt suggest until your dont have kids =) Look at them as your babies first work of art!|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Vitamin E oil or cream and cocoa butter.  Use both morning and night.  My son is two weeks old and my stretchmarks have already faded so much just from using that.

hqogf9oGaa	Well I'm right there with you sharing your disgust.  I think the NHS should really standardise the whole "free" treatment thing.  My friend stays 5 miles from me but is under a different health board although she is treated at the same hospital.  She is entitled to one free cycle whilst I was entitled to three.<br>  <br>  On to answering your question, I had my first cycle of IVF in March 08 which was successful but sadly I miscarried.  Don't want to worry you about this so have to say that this doesn't happen to everyone - I was going through a severely stressful time with work and it effected the pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, we had some embryos frozen from that cycle and had Frozen Embryo Transfer in September 08 and I am now 26 week pregnant (or will be tomorrow...lol).<br>  <br>  Have you considered having any embryos frozen from your first cycle as FET is often much cheaper and would give you extra chances if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  Also, not sure if you have heard of this site:-<br>  <br>  www.fertilityfriends.co.uk<br>  <br>  It's a really good site - I couldnt' have got through my treatments without the ladies on there.  They are so supportive, understanding and will happily answer any questions you may have.  You will be able to find others in your area who may have been treated at the clinic you are using too which is never a bad thing.<br>  <br>  Keeping everything crossed that your 1st cycle will be successful.<br>  <br>  Wishng you lots of luck and sending heaps of babydust your way.<br>  <br>  Indigo<br>  <br>  xxx

It makes no sense to any of us either.<br>  <br>  The only thing I can think of is if you have a "chemical" pregnancy, in which the zygote implants, dies, but the placenta keeps on living and making an amniotic sac.  If that happens, eventually your body "gets it" that there's no baby there and you have what's essentially a miscarriage of the placenta.  <br>  <br>  But they don't call it a 1/2 pregnancy.

JOVWBOOCaa	You just might be! You should get a HPT!!! You definitely can have sore nipples in early pregnancy. I am 5 weeks pregnant and my nipples are KILLING me, not the breasts, the nipples. When I take my bra off or put it on and ESPECIALLY when it gets cold and they get hard.....YIKES! IT is so painful, they say by the 2nd trimester this should ease up. Mine have been sore since 1 week after conception and just keep getting worse. I would try a test and if you get a neg retest in 3 days. It makes it more difficult to tell bc you have been irregular so TECHNICALLY you have not missed a period yet. Good luck!|`|oHNrktxTaa	I suggest you take a HPT first thing in the morning to find out & see.

It will happen when you are ready, believe me, I've been there.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|8RfmosODaa	You could be! I had sore nipples/breast the last time and that's how i knew but unfortunately i misscarried and this time before my period i also had sore breast so it could also be your period is just starting late since you said you are irregular.|`|smsUZG4Iaa	you should wait at least a week before testing so you will have a more accurate answer.. it could be your priod or pregnancy.. early pregnancy shows the same symptoms as a period.. its so hard to tell. Best of Luck

ORb6N0fCaa	Of course it works, I have this program for my 17 month old and he has learned a ton from it! Don't get it if you have a child older than 2 though, most kids over that age find it boring, but it is perfect for little babies.  You also have to make sure you stick with the program, especially for young babies, it will be a long time before you realize they've learned anything but then all of a sudden they start showing you what they've learned and it is really cool.  Also, when you get the full program, they send a parents DVD and Dr Titzer who created the program has his daughter come on (the one the infomercial shows reading at 9 months) and she talks to the parents group, so its cool to see her grown up and thriving from having learned to read so early.  Good luck and it is well worth the $200!!|`|Piw6xeiKaa	my boyfriends friend has a kid and his wife bought it for their kid. the kid is almost 7 months old and he recognizes stuff. you ask him to point out blue from like pink or some other color and he picks the right color. that kid is smart. as he gets older, he'll really be able to read... omg... i know i'm getting this for my niece or nephew when he or she is born in a few months....|`|xMirGcj7aa	not sure but try this web site starfall.com and this product alphabet Al this really help
LcOPL8gCaa	ya you are stressed out... I'd ask a close friend to go shopping with you, or go to the movies. About that dad.. He will soon change his mind, once he knows your really going to be keeping the baby, he will be there for you. Or he should. I know a lot of guys get freaked out by the thought of becoming a daddy. and yes times like these are really hard for people, your work is stressing you out the most, maybe take something home to do and listen to music while doing them? You want to relaxe as much as possible. maybe try taking a nice warm bath with bubbles and have music playing? That always helped my sister.<br>   Mostly you need to start thinking of you & your baby. You can't let people get you down, your dad and you prob wont have that same connection, but you can try. Write him. Tell him you love him, tell your mom you love her, even if you truly dont. Let them know you care. because it seems like you really do care about your father. Maybe you can send him a card too? you know the ones that sing?<br>  <br>  But take time for yourself. Go get your nails done, or your hair. Don't dye it tho, dying is not good for your health when pregnant.<br>  Take pregnancie yoga! Thats a good one, i helped my sister with hers. Its was really odd, but it was cool too. Find out how you want to have your baby, and put some real thinking time into everything. Hope you get better.<br>  <br>  Good luck & best wishes & congrats|`|SYaSbJb5aa	You poor thing.  Maybe there is a support group in your area for single mothers?  Try some deep breathing exercises, maybe join a maternity yoga class... You don't have to go through this alone.|`|90Pb6eooaa	No you really don't want to pass it on to the baby.  You don't want a baby whose a train wreck because of bad nerves. Get a drip and put your big girl panties on.  Talk to your doctor about cognitive/behavioral therapy.  I sounds like you have bad anxiety.  There are certainly many other pregnant women in worse positions!  You're gonna be a parent now.  What that means is someone's gonna be dependant on you now and not the other way around.  Good Luck and God Bless.|`|RcKQYqJeaa	Well... my mom had me and was pregnant with my baby brother whn my father convicted of murdering her very own sister...<br>  <br>  Both sides of the famiyl abandoned my mom and she was left t work 3 jobs with 2 kids...<br>  <br>  If my mom can do it and handle it with grace, I know you can...<br>  <br>  I'm not saying it'll be easy, but my brother and I turned out SO well and happy and we respect my mom more than anything...<br>  <br>  Breathe in a try and find a church nearby that will ovr the spiritual help and friendship you need...<br>  <br>  Please feel free to email me.|`|43e504b1f4fd36893ba1960f77705990aa	I am so very sorry! I would look for some free help for mothers in your community, and if you go to a church ask them for help. Definitely see a doctor to check on your health as well as your baby's.|`|O3hOcoDUaa	see an ob check if the baby is overstressed tell him to refer you to a psychologist!!!!!!|`|5ZwuIVPdaa	this happens alot where the father decides he's not ready and they leave. u really should have made sure BOTH of u were ready and it would have helped a little if you were married first. abortion isnt right but its an option. my mom had 1 before i was born and was about to with me. im not sure how big the baby is now, and it might be to late. ur just gonna have to fight through this and everything should work out. there are alot of men out there that find pregnacy sexy so maybe u can get urself a new, better man that can take care of u and the baby coming up, gl girl hope everything goes well|`|eU5Eth2aaa	The most important thing is you and your baby.  You need to try to put yourself in the best position possible...Even if that included cutting back your hours or working from home, etc..  As far as the relationship with your father, I would just start writing him letters.  He may not respond, but he might soften towards you after reading them.  Resolving these issues would be a good thing.  You definitely don't need the extra stress.<br>  <br>  As for the baby's father, you are probably better off without him..<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your little one..Congrats!|`|AA10458750	First off, PLENTY of women go through pregnancy by themselves, it's not the end of the world. My baby's father denied it was his from the time I told him and hasn't supported me since. Yes, it hurts, but you have to be strong and get on with your pregnacy. All the stress is not good for baby, like you already know. The best thign to do is go for a walk everyday. Don't think about work, your family situation or relationship difficulties. Breathe in deep amounts of fresh air and take tiem to connect with your baby. You can't solve all oyur preoblems, but you can learn to deal with them.
7clS7baaaa	ive had this happen to me before as well.  make sure to tell him daddy did not hurt you.  the reason i gave to my child was that mommy and daddy were wrestling.  sometimes daddy does it with you girls and you have fun.  so mommy wanted to wrestle with daddy too.  u understand!|`|6RGnG1ukaa	Exactly what you told him. He is to young to understand the concept of sex. He will soon or a later forget about. Probably within the next week he will have completely forgot about it.|`|CiFR2xuBaa	Oh my, I can imagine how you felt. My four year old walked in on us the other night. We had our door open but the mood struck and since the kids were soundly sleeping we didn't think much of it.....until we saw her standing at the foot of the bed. I totally understand how you felt.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	He'll forget sooner or later and you won't have to worry about it! My nephew caught my sis and her husband in the act he walked into their room in the middle of the night and said,"Ewww! What are youguys doing?" My B-I-L said "wrestling?" and my nephew said " well you guys are naked and THAT'S JUST NASTY!" lmao! he doesn't remember it and he was 5 at the time!|`|iMY2fgYdaa	don't worry about...he has probably already forgot about it...kids don't usually mull over things like we do. you gave him an answear and that was that as far as he was concerned I am sure.|`|AA10529334	That sounds good enough to me. Unless he brings it up again let it go.|`|GgMMvHI8aa	Oh gees, I forgot this one. A few months back, this happened to us.  <br>  Our daughter is 3. She was napping mid-day and sound asleep. SO WHOO HOO, my husband and I finally had a moment to ourselves. We left the doors cracked open just a little so we could hear if she got up. My husband and I have gotten really good with quickies. But this time not quick enough, we were nearing completion, and it was wonderful.  <br>  Then out of nowhere, we hear a scream from the doorway. AAAHHHHH.  <br>  Needless to say we both did not finish, two more minutes, but did not happen. VERY frustrating.  <br>   <br>  We go out to the other room, and she would not look at my husband, or go near him for the rest of the day. lol.  We did not really talk about it, just put on some funny toons to get her distracted. I mean really how much can you explain to a 3yr old.?|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Exactly what you told him lol. Hes young to young to understand as long as he knows that daddy wasn't hurting you everything is fine
rrWhhiMEaa	Most women will ovulate appx 14 days before menstruation, unless she is having ovulation problems. That means you should try to have sex on or before the 11th day. That means count 11 days after the first day she starts bleeding. You can even start trying from the 7th day itself. Also if  you have sex every other day(alternate) you will build up more sperm count. A woman can become pregnant from sex up to five days before ovulating.<br>  <br>  Ask your wife to become familiar with the signs of ovulation as noted here <a href="http://www.estronaut.com/a/ovulation_fertility.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.estronaut.com/a/ovulation_fer...</a><br>  <br>  If these do not work, perhaps you should consult a doctor who can test your sperm count and check for other possibilities.<br>  <br>  One year is not that long. Keep trying. Best of luck.|`|AA12085492	Relax, <br>  <br>  You cannot depend on a particular day, If you ask me personally, follow this :-<br>  <br>  Every day from 11th Day to 14th <br>  & Alternate Days from 15th to 19th day|`|LxWYVksSaa	sounds like you might have a luteal phase defect. i think you may have low progesterone. why dont you go to the doctor to get hormone blood tests taken?<br>  <a href="http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/luteal-phase-defect.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyhopes.com/articles/luteal...</a><br>  <br>  good luck!
rtQi0SSraa	I think vaccines and lack of co-sleeping and not breast feeding could have to do with it. Also smoking around a child and drug use.
khFGiA1iaa	I'm not sure if it's normal during pregnancies, but I would definitely get it checked out at your next doctors visit. Any visible changes with your breasts (having lumps, moles, etc.) could mean something, or nothing at all. If the mole "grows" then you REALLY need to get it checked out. It could be cancerous. I'm not a doctor, so I'm not going to tell you something for sure... but since you are a women you already have a  chance for breast cancer, and a new mole just appearing could be bad. Or like I said before, it could mean nothing at all. Since you are pregnant, I'd take extra precautions. Try taking your question to babycenter.com. You can get community answers as well as expert answers and advice. I looked up a question similar to yours, and here is the link:<br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/400_shoui-should-i-worry-that-moles-have-grown-around-my-nipples_2325566_165248050595.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/400_shoui-shou...</a><br>  <br>  Hope I helped even just a little!<br>  <br>  Jessica|`|ykP7I3caaa	I got a freckle on my left nipple, the doctor said it was nothing. But since yours is a mole you should probably ask. Pregnancy does cause things like this, so it's probably nothing but be on the safe side.|`|6igjX2cnaa	I heard that changing skin things such as moles, skin tags, etc are common in pregnancy.  If you are really worried a dr. can just check it out for you.  I got a dark mole on my tummy after I quit bc pills 15 months ago.  My hormones were all whacky and I freaked out about this new mole.  I ended up getting it removed and it was fine.  Best wishes hun!|`|uuHPneEcaa	I haven't notice any new moles.I had the one under my eye fall off but I haven't notice any new ones. <br>  <br>  now my skin has changed ALOT.. I have never had ache in my life and now my face looks like a connect the dot picture. <br>  <br>  I think u should call ur doctor and make a appointment and have it checked out. U can never be safe then sorry.|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	Pregnancy can bring on some odd changes. But even while pregnant ANY change like that should be looked at by a doctor.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	if your worried go have it looked at.  its probably nothing, but you might as well put your mind at ease.|`|d7bJIgqlaa	I had skin cancer three years ago and found it in a mole.  I still see my dermatologist for check ups and most recently I told him that my husband and I may be trying to get pregnant soon.  He said that your body changes alot and new markings and moles will appear so that if any of them look strange to come see him.  He said that a lot of women find that skin cancer shows up during pregnancy.  Now, with the honesty being said hear this too...I really don't think you should worry.  I think you should see your doctor or a dermatologist to be safe, but no matter what it turns out to be, you found it early enough to ensure it won't be a huge deal!  Go you!!!|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I got a bunch of skin tacts and new freckles once I became pregnant. I read that this is normal. But if it is a dark mole, I would show your doctor just to be safe.|`|90Pb6eooaa	Don't worry, but get it checked out very soon.  Especially if you've never seen anything in that spot before.  Ask to see  dermatologist. Good Luck.|`|BA9ymc2Laa	Maybe just getting it checked out is a good thing, just to help you feel better.<br>  I would.|`|DJd0DruQaa	ya id get it checked out
IuzaNq2Uaa	Gosh they're all beautiful.<br>  <br>  My favorite is Rose Cordelia - so elegant, and different to the usual Cordelia Rose.<br>  <br>  I don't think Rose Charlotte is hard to say, and it's very pretty.<br>  <br>  If you added Rose Arabella, I would definitely vote for that - it's gorgeous.|`|ouzrDPaSaa	I like Rose Cordelia best, I think Cordelia is a stunning, elegant name BUT... I think Rose Amelia flows the best.  Good luck choosing!|`|jMGyLvNsaa	I really like Rose Ameila.<br>  I wouldn't go with Rose Charlotte because it is hard to say, and I don't think it flows as nicely as some of the other ones.<br>  <br>  Some suggestions I have are:<br>  Rose Isabella<br>  Rose Amber<br>  Rose Alexandra|`|qv3W0MDJaa	from your list, Rose Cordelia but if I were to add my own name to the list,it would be Rose Anabelle or Rose Arabel,so cute right?|`|8uvb3Nroaa	Rose Anastasia is really unique.|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Rose Caroline is stunning!|`|heC9aQ18aa	The name that flows better with Rose in my opinion is Rose Amelia. They go fairly nice together. However I like every name you have on this list but they don't go as well with Rose, as with Amelia. <br>  I agree, Rose is a name. There is no first name names and middle name names. Just these last few years Rose has been used as a middle a lot so I like the idea of the name being a first name.  I knew a lovely lady by the name of Rose. Now, you rarely hear it as a first name so it's different. Pretty.|`|hggYZSyQaa	Rose Cordelia or Rose Amelia are cute especially Rose Cordelia.<br>  <br>  How about:<br>  Rose Hope<br>  Rose Joy<br>  Rose Faith<br>  Rose Swift<br>  <br>  They all seem so peaceful names.If they hear they're middle name they will probably act shy or peacefully.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Rose Amelia or Rose Amelie are both gorgeous!<br>  <br>  I love love love Rose as a first name, and I depise it as a middle. It is so overused and predictable. Parents do not want to think of a middle name so they just tack Rose on there.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I like Rose Cordelia the best. <br>  <br>  And no i don't think Rose Charlotte is hard to say, i think it flows pretty good.<br>  <br>  I prefer Rose as a middle name but it doesn't mean it doesn''t make a nice first name too.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|e663a3eea9acd94ea0c82d74d58bb3cbaa	I like Rose Cordelia, Rose Amelia, and Rose Charlotte.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Rose Amelia.|`|pDrdCRQcaa	Rose Cordelia|`|ODvnyAdlaa	Rose amelie xx|`|wzmo2Ju7aa	While I love both Charlotte and Amelie, I think Rose Caroline just sounds perfect! <br>  <br>  I think people choose Rose as a middle name because its very simple, and very beautiful. For the same reason that they choose Lynne, Grace, and Anne as middle names. My middle name is Anne, but I think it would be a much prettier first name. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck!!!|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Rose is more of a middle name for me as well...but it's really pretty. I think of Rose and Sage from the show Privileged on CW. <br>  <br>  Rose Charlotte is caaaayooote.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	Rose Amelia is lovely !<br>  I really like the name Rose Annabelle for a girl also.<br>  <br>  ADD - I don't think Rose Charlotte is hard to say at all !!|`|fQVM8OHmaa	I like Rose Amelia.  It sounds pretty and its easy to say and remember.
oHNrktxTaa	As frustrating as this is, you must give it some time & try to relax, stay calm, & be positive. When you are stressed, it does not help your body, instead it could mess up your cycle & get all screwy.<br>  It will happen, all in due time. <br>  My husband & I are also TTC for the first time & I believe me, it is frustrating & tiresome to always see a BFN. But, I do believe it will happen.<br>  <br>  Stay positive!<br>  Sending you future BABY DUST!!!|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	Please do not stress. You can still get your BFP.

I thought you could only test up to 5 days early, not 6...
SnQvsOPwaa	Whats best for the baby. There's your answer.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Your children need and deserve stability in their lives. Give him an ultimatum: You grow up and our in their lives every single day OR we break up and I go after you for child support.<br>  <br>  Stay strong, he sounds like an a$$|`|JRXpYW3Naa	I wouldn't forgive him. I might let him see the children if he straightens up and supports them. If his family is decent, they will understand you had to leave him and they won't take it out on their grandchildren.|`|YdQOpsHCaa	Well you can keep meeting his parents after you leave him what you should deffinitely do. He is an a$$, get devorced and take from him as much as you can. :P|`|AA10540570	no-you obviously can do it on your own! DOesn't sound like he even wants forgiveness. Cause that would mean he had to not do it anymore!!!|`|OZ7VZbDLaa	you should be thinking what is right for your kids. forgiving can be in many different forms. you can forgive him but just because you forgive him doesnt mean you have to be with him! and you dont have to "leave" his parents just because you and your boyfriend arent together. me and my sons father havent been together for over a yr and even tho i was in the same situation where he just left. i did for give him and that was that. even tho he doesnt see his son i still keep in touch very well with his family. and there is nothinq right you can tell your kids that will make anything better.|`|tnQGOsaeaa	you said u were 14 in another question, not a working women lol w/e <br>  <br>  do not forgive him! your worth more than that!|`|NUtB1SKsaa	It sounds to me like this guy is not going to be the right partner for you.  That, of course, is a different job description from "daddy".  Unfortunately, you can not and should not take that responsibility away from him.  I'm relieved to hear that his parents are in the family picture.  Your children will benefit by having that relationship even when "Mr. Irresponsible" is AWOL.  Perhaps you should get out on your own (but keep close ties with the grandparents).  You deserve a life too.  I would always encourage a relationship between child and parent (you or grandparents might have to monitor the visits).  If they don't get it (relationship with parent) now, the children will seek it out later - and in between there can be some insufferable acting out.  Kids always lose in these deals.  But that does not preclude having a life for yourself.  It's a tough juggle. It sounds like you are on a verge of making some important decisions.  You seem to be on the right track.<br>  Good luck girl, the best to you and the kids!

If you have another one somewhere I'd dig it out.|`|XOtHsTo0aa	I would get the other one out if she likes having a mobile.  My daughter is a "love my mobile" baby.  She has to have it play every night when she is going to sleep.  It is the Fisher Price Rainforest one where there is a remote where I can push it back on without her seeing me.  She LOVES it.  As long as your daughter is not standing up or pulling on it I'd for sure put one back on.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I have the rainforest fisher price one too, my son also loves it :)<br>  <br>  I plan on taking the mobile part away when he can stand up - on this one you can remove the moving part and use the base as a music and light box.  It says to do this from when a baby can stand and possibly pull it down on themself.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	I had a mobile when my daughter was really young then I took it out because it was in the way. But then somebody gave me a Fisher price Aquarium that you place it on the railing of the crib.. and she loved it! It has different functions so it cna be set up just to water noise and the light.. which is pretty  soothing. <br>  <br>  Look here's the link.. ours is an older version of this one:<br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2674699" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a>|`|DQkDQraOaa	Neither of my kids ever had a mobile.

Andrew is a very nice name though. Same with Thomas Matthew. They are nice names but don't flow together as if they were reversed. For both boys choices, reversed they would go well together. For me all are nice name though.|`|mRQxlNH5aa	I love Madeline Rose and Blake Matthew.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Madeline Rose - Madeleine is lovely spelled correctly.

My son is almost 6 months and can't eat more than 5 ounces at once. but he eats often.  the one time i came home & nursed him (he still seemed hungry) after my husband had recently finished a bottle he just didn't realize how full he was & about 20-30 minutes later he just got a funny look on his face and spit up...i mean SPIT UP a lot.. just see what the doc says.

NAIkcKssaa	My son is 18 months and has done the same for awhile.He does it for attention and he likes the feeling. i found that if i ignore it when he is trying to get attention he stops quickly. If I make a big deal about it he does it more. if he does this while he is playing by himself. i let him do it. there is no way to stop them that i have found. it can be frustrating and look painful but you cant control every moment. So my suggestion is to let it happen. its not from violence its to see your reaction or feel what happens. He wants to explore all the feelings texture, soft ,hard floor, wall, glass door etc. my son still does this and it can be very painful for me when he hits me. I tell him we don't hit with our head it hurts mommy.if you want to hit your head try hitting the pillow. We will make it a game. sometimes it works others it becomes a huge tantrum. I think distraction works the best.i hope this helps a little ,know that there are other children that do this as well.|`|BzvstX7uaa	My son did that a lot when he was younger.

He could get permanent brain damage from that. Their skull is about as firm as a block of cheese. I wouldn't just ignore him. Make him wear a helmut. I dont know, I know I sound scared or whatever, but that could cause irrevocable damage.|`|WsUSAgLmaa	I bet he thinks its so funny to...my son did this all the time i dont know what they get out of it.It looks real painful!! He would bang the back of his head on the walls and he still does this every now and then for attention and laughs..n he'll b 3 in 2 weeks. But you just have to tell him dont do that. I almost bought my son a helmet but i didnt want him to be looking special.

Not buy things around the home either.   She need to cut grass, shovel drives etc in the neighborhood till it is paid back.  Finally she should be grounded.  NO TV, phone party with friends computer for at least a month if not 3 months and if it was a large amount 6 months.    As for not thinking she did anything wrong she needs to be talked to about steealing and why it was wrong.  just because you want to do something does not mean you can.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Not the first time and she doesn't understand what she did wrong.  If it were my child I would take a ride to the police station with her and have an officer explain the problem in detail and what will happen to her next time it happens.  I may even file charges against her if her attitude didn't improve.  Other than that she wouldn't be going anywhere for at least a month and she would have to pay back the amount stolen.<br>  <br>  I think most kids don't take their parent's punishments seriously because parents often forget or don't carry the punishment out to the end.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	Are you kidding me... what would somebody do to you, if you did the same thing.<br>  <br>  You'd pay a fine, and be forced to return the money.

0ctwJF47aa	Try taking a bath before bed and drinking some sleeptime tea(they have it at most grocery stores), you need to get really relaxed and the baby relaxed before bed to sleep well. If that doesnt work talk to your doctor about taking tylenol PM, my doctor said it was okay for me to take during my pregnancy if I needed it, but everyone is different so discuss it with your doc first. Goodluck and congrats.|`|AA10458750	Hate to tell you, but it's not goign to get any better.If you can't sleep now, wait until you can feel the baby kicking at night.|`|5wej1TKDaa	I had the same problem, and trust me, it's not going to get any better.  When the baby gets a bigger he/she will be pushing down on your bladder & you'll be going to the bathroom every hour all night.  My OB told me I was allowed to take Tylenol PM or Benedryl to help me sleep.  She said the ingredients are not harmful to the baby.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit**This also helped me, watching a REALLY boring tv program w/ the volume really low...it's bound to have an effect.|`|Z2o87knraa	take sleeping pills that all i can tel u or go to a doctor for better advice|`|LcOPL8gCaa	Yes I got lots of ideas!<br>  Okay you can vacuum and then dance with music to actually make you tired then when you are tired and feel like your gonna fall asleep but your not sleeping prop your feet up and lay back and read a good book.<br>  <br>  you can take a bubble bath and relaxe.<br>  Eat some really good food while laying in your bed and try to go to bed early =] then wake up later.<br>  <br>  I know your prob like i've tried! but try again. =] if nothing works, take some iron pills, and they are suppose to help you sleep try also eating healthier things.

bTlhBX3daa	I'm guessing that maybe your friend was thinking about you and your baby throughout your pregnancy, but was feeling timid about making the first move since your falling out. <br>  <br>  If you care about this person, give her a chance. You might find that with you both being mommy's, a whole different aspect of friendship blossoms. But, if this person causes more trouble in your life than good things, maybe just let her go and move on.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Maybe seeing you had a baby has made her realize how much time has passed for a petty argument. Its quite probable that she just misses you, and wants to get back together. Babies have a way of bringing out the good left in people, and igniting old friendships.|`|OXXE3T2Aaa	Because shes finally starting to mature and realized that u guys were fighting for a dumb reason.

There's nothing wrong with re-kindling an old friendship. Good Luck|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	It sounds like she was feeling the way you were. She didn't really hate you but didn't know how to reconnect. Running into you and seeing your baby gave her the push she needed to start your relationship up again. You're going to have to really think about how you feel about her. Was it something petty that got you to this spot? Was she truly a good friend? Have you both grown up some?|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	give her a chance, maybe she's trying to make up for the past. Let the past be in the past, and start over.
i8Ch743Laa	Try hanging out with her,and guage her to see if she's really wanting to be friends or not. It could have just been the hormones while pregnant that put her off like that. Hang out with her,and if all else fails,just keep her at an acquantence level.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	She was pregnant and moody man. didn't people get on YOUR nerves when you were pregnant?? your friends world can't always revolve around you... maybe she was going through some personal things that she needed to take care of. family comes before friends. give her another chance.|`|iwYu32N2aa	She is not obligated to buy you something just because you had a baby. And maybe she is over a stupid little fight that happened over a year ago.|`|zwctZ812aa	Maybe she was just very busy with her baby.  I'm sure you know how it is with a new little one...you don't really have much time to keep up with your social life.  That's not really an excuse for completely abandoning your friends, but if you want to give her another chance go for it...one can never have too many friends.  Besides, no one said you had to become best friends with her, just don't get too attached this time.|`|0ctwJF47aa	If you guys were really good friends and she really does want that friendship back you should be able to ask her what was going on then and why she pushed you away like that, tell her it really hurt you, she will understand and hopefully if something like that ever happens again you guys can talk about it and avoid not being friends for a whole year! Goodluck sweetie.|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	she was probably just hormonal- and maybe felt ashamed of the way she had treated you and didn't know how to apologize.  That's my guess.  Both me and my sister are pregnant with our first babies and i know the hormones are raging when we're in the same room!  Try lunch, and see where it goes, don't have any expectations and you won't be dissapointed.|`|fFX0Xk9Uaa	Sounds like a case of pregnancy hormones to me...I would forgive her...and to your point about the gift, she as your friend is under no obligation to get you something, especially since you were not talking.  If you base your friendship on gifts then maybe you need to take a look at yourself instead of blaming her.|`|OliihexIaa	Apparently whatever issues she had are now resolved.  Maybe it was a pregnancy/hormonal thing.  Just give her the benefit of the doubt and start over.|`|dn2UCOkqaa	She didn't do anything to break your trust. Maybe you didn't talk to her when she was pregnant or get her anything. Now you guys have alot in commone because you guys have another baby now|`|0BC2WTyoaa	Maybe she got over whatever issue it was that she had and she misses you and wants to make up for lost time.|`|23F70N1Raa	I'm sure that you were not always peachy when you were pregnant either.  Between her hormones and the stress of having children and a family, sometimes friends say and do things they dont really mean and don't know how to come back to the friends they hurt/lost.<br>  <br>  So, if you truly do miss her friendship go out with her and you may find out what was going on in her world at the time she walked out of yours.  The point is... sometimes life messes up friendships and if this is one that you cherished it won't hurt you to see if it is still there.  If you find that you don't trust her or can't take her seriously, well then it is your choice to walk out again... but give the girl a chance.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	maybe she was going through something she didnt feel she could share with you and she pushed you away, i wouldnt read to much into it, jus do lunch and feel her out and see if shes still the same person, then you be the judge on whether or not you think you should continue the friendship..|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Hormones screw with people. I wasn't the most fun person to be around while pregnant or the first few months postpartum. And presents certainly aren't a must. My husband's best friend didn't get anything for our daughter when she was born and neither of us cared. A gift is a gift, its not mandatory.<br>  <br>  If you want to be friends with her again, do it. If not, don't. It is up to you. It is nice to have mommy friends with kids the same age as your children.
c06a8280930afd80d9f6fd68dd16b6a5aa	Hi, this isnt a bad place to look for a birthmother but be sure ur family can show the proof that they have gone thru the homestudy and such. A birth mother letter is very important to a birth mom. Also are ur parents ready to answer all the questions a birth mother will ask like who pays for the birth mothers lawyer, will she be compensated for expenses etc. I placed a child for adoption 12 years ago but afraid to look for a local agency until a friend contacted an agency for me. Also get verification that she is pregnant like doctor name and info for ur lawyer to verify. Good luck on finding a birth mother.|`|dcd1de17803a79e3f8899aed15210b60aa	Do you have a profile or Dear Birth Mother letter--please post the link!  Has you homestudy been completed and where can Birth Mothers call to verify.|`|AA10848200	Internet is not a good way to meet people.. if there is a company fine.. but make sure to get an adoption lawyer .. <br>  <br>  some people are out to scam you, i saw one on "dateline" where this woman claimed to be pregnant and wanting to give up the baby, and told several families this and was getting money and stuff<br>  <br>  she wasn't pregnant.. <br>  <br>  so make sure to protect your self and follow proper procedures|`|8b33e8b8e6bc416fdcdf2d02f00b9b6faa	don't try to do this on the internet sweetie you don't know what you are asking for
618072b2b2476fabaaaf1a9fa0e38a05aa	OMG my HSG was the worst thing i have ever been through. My left tube was blocked and my right one was 95% blocked. I felt like i was dying on the table. When they inserted the "rod" i jumped and it nicked my cervix so i bled for awhile after the procedure. I feel sorry for anyone who has to endure this horrible precedure but sometimes it is necessary. I am so glad everything is open for you lol!!!!|`|1985aae12658ce3cf22365393dcd654baa	YES, it was very painful, but the good thing is it only lasts about 30 seconds and then the bad pain goes away.  The rest is just like mild menstural cramps.  I didn't feel the best right afterwards, I was really hot and nauseated but that went away and I was fine in a few hours.  My tubes were open thankfully or it would have hurt worse.|`|5c4f75a1d34f57b4f0511c3f36f5294caa	YES!  Mine was very painful!  It made me sweat and left me light headed.<br>  <br>  My tubes were open too- I say this because some say that blockage makes it more painful!  Can't imagine that!<br>  <br>  Good news is that I got pregnant same cycle!!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|1ffc303db15fdc00d04d05f7b03f2f53aa	I had it during my laparoscopy, which I was under general anesthesia, so I didn't feel anything.  However, I felt horrible for the next two days.  I had bad cramping as well.  I assumed it was because my OBGYN had done a biopsy of my uterus lining and removed some endometriosis during the procedure.  It was worse than when I had my D&C, which I felt fine just hours later.|`|1e5562d67124e0cd53f3abd1cb430305aa	YES!!!  Mine hurt very badly and I had no blockage what-so-ever.  I have a Bicornuate Uterus, not sure if that made a difference or not.  I felt like my whole pelvic region was swollen and super sore for the next couple of days and I had cramping and that discharge that looked similar to blood (they said it was what they used to clean my cervix) for the next couple of days as well.  Advil did absolutely nothing for me!  Take care and just take a nap if you can, the pain will go away in a while :)|`|8f5cdbb620c5dc4ec50e46b43bf0a233aa	When I had my HSG, I felt a lot of discomfort. I went in and didn't take anything to relieve the pain. I felt cramping afterward and my doctor said that I could go back to work, but since my commute is an hour each way, I decided to stay home for the rest of the day. The cramping lasted for a couple of days, but it wasn't horrible (like menstrual cramps). My pain threshold is pretty high so I guess that's why it didn't hurt as much as I thought it would.|`|d1511bccc292ecc36af4e64848b00af3aa	Mine was a cakewalk, but I have heard that it can be intensely painful for some people. Hang in there. Maybe it cleaned out your tubes and did good things for your fertility!|`|fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	My HSG wasn't painful. I have endometeriosis which causes severe pain during a period so cramping doesn't bother me much.<br>  <br>  Glad you got good results and Good Luck!!!

a5FjIQFzaa	I'm actually due today too.<br>  <br>  My sister has an underactive thyroid, which was only discovered about 7 years ago.  With her first and second pregnancy (12 and 9 years ago) she had very few pregnancy symptoms bar not having periods and getting bigger.  She didn't have sore breasts at the start etc.  <br>  <br>  There had been some mix up with her dates for the first baby (I think her periods were irregular) because of this and the baby was induced over 2 weeks late and so was very lucky to survive (she's now 11, beautiful in every way and perfectly healthy).  Her 2nd baby also had to be induced.<br>  <br>  I don't know if your thyroid is affecting the fact that you haven't gone into labour just yet (my thyroid is fine and I'm still sitting here like a big walrus) but my sister felt that with her first 2 pregnancies it was as if her body didn't know she was pregnant.  She had another baby almost 2 years ago and said the whole pregnancy experience was very different to before, when she hadn't been on any medication for the thyroid problem.  She didn't go into labour naturally though as she had an elective section a few days before her date.<br>  <br>  My point is, I would urge you to be very careful that your dates are right.  There may be some correllation between the thyroid and not going into labour, but if you keep an eye on it it shouldn't be a problem.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I had an underactive thyroid, but I was (and still am) on medication for it.<br>  <br>  If you are taking your meds, then your thyroid isn't underactive anymore, the meds make up the difference.   If you're not on meds, then that is a concern, because usually your thyroid goes all out of whack after delivery anyways, and you're really going to have to watch out... post delivery and low thyroid is very common.  Please be careful.<br>  <br>  Could this affect your delivery... probably, but I'm not sure exactly how.  A low thyroid affects nearly everything.  I delivered 2 days late.|`|8KYtMwfHaa	visit the following url|`|AHSjo9omaa	I agree with the first answer.<br>  If your taking your meds it shouldnt make much difference.<br>  I also believe that babies make their appearance when they are 100% ready, and not when the mothers body dictates, as some believe.<br>  <br>  My son was just over a week late, and every mum and every baby can tell you that every single pregnancy is different.<br>  Dont worry, and good luck xxxx
n6XYYyoLaa	he def doesn't have to be standing or walking on his on, you will be suprised how strong his legs will get once he gets the hang of the jumperoo....as long as his trunk muscles are strengthening and he has good head and neck control, he should be fine...i think we first put her in about four mos; for a while she was too short to touch the ground even on the lowest setting (she's a petite little gal:O)) and she had a ball just playing with the toys and learning how to turn the seat...once she could touch the bottom (didn't take long!) she has been jumping like a mad woman every time she gets in it! it's great for burning off extra energy during the day! when we first put her in, i did have to roll up a blanket to put around her bc she didn't come close to filling the seat..LOL<br>  her legs are sooo much stronger too, and now she thinks she has to bounce on everything her feet touch, even if its mommy, LOL....try it and see how he does....if he likes it and has support if he needs it, he should be fine...i can't remember the recommended age on the instructions, wouldn't hurt to check them as well.....i think so far, with bouncy seats, bumbo, big girl chair, swing, etc etc, we have gotten the most mileage out of that jumperoo for sure!!!!|`|rAkWoweOaa	my son just turned 5 months and only now does he get how to use it.|`|TWYkVjiJaa	yea we used ours from about 3 months - i couldn't wait! ha, you know your own baby if he can hold his head then should be fine,just do for short periods of time so he doesn't get put off it,only thing we found with ours our little girl couldn't reach the floor that well ha! so used to put pillows or books underneath to help her out,though was a while before learned to bounce! but still loved being in there just looking round from a better angle!|`|VY4LqfLpaa	once they are able to hold their head up really good on their own.  Plus, with our son (he was premature) I noticed that even though he was holding his head up really well he wasn't really big enough to be comfortable in it till he was about 13+ lbs.  It was also more comfortable at that point for me to get him out without having to get somebody to help me...|`|UXhFcHCHaa	i would say about 4 months. my son wasnt interested before then. at 5 months he loves his jumper|`|zFbhYl1Baa	my son started using his at 4 months|`|nnTSpsEiaa	You need to wait until he can hold his head up on his own. Usually around 3-4 months old.
91sbAzoaaa	okay my daughters father never really had an interest in a relationship with her he came around every once in a while, and i never really wanted child support- because my way of thinking is this if he want to help with his daughter fine, but if he doesn't then fine also ..i don't need him i can do it on my own. But he though i was going to do it later in life and make him pay back child support so he file it and they reward him with standard visitation thats every other weekend and a month in the summer. so just do it get child support and have the help u need, if u wait  he'll look like the good guy if he decideds to put himself on it.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	He definitely needs to be paying child support.  Take him to court so there's an official record of his payments.  It benefits the both of you.|`|0psCy0XXaa	Go through the child support agency and they will make him pay.  He will then have to if he wants to see his child.  I have to pay it and i go see my boy at least once a day usually twice and i pay even more on top if it is asked for.  This dude needs to go the extra miles for his daughters sake.  Don't let him push you around.|`|Yp92RMSmaa	dont give him you child... make him pay gurl!!! He left you with a child alone to struggle!! GOTO COURT AND NAILTHAT SUCKA i have the exact same story you do hun im 28 and i have twins, and no father he left when they were 2weeks old and now there both 8 months  hope youll be ok!!|`|I7QcHkLFaa	First off go to court and have them set up support payments.|`|dYa5AEwSaa	you should, send him to the dick.|`|deEWD1k3aa	My parents go through this.  Men and women alike can be extremely unaccommodating.  You need to go to court, although expensive in most cases, it will be worth it in the long run.  My parents haven't really had anything court mandated and arguments are miserable.  It would be very smart to get this taken care of before your daughter is old enough to pass judgement on either you or your ex's actions.  The last thing you need is to be portrayed as the bad guy for not providing because of him.|`|OSQOnrnHaa	i hate how ppl think its exceptable to get with someone have a baby and break up with people shuold thiink bout it ist lol how is ur child going to feel
d852dd5b6aac9706e868cca40cf971e0aa	White discharge that is milky or creamy in consistency has been an early sign of pregnancy for me. It is the body's way of lubricating the vaginal area, to prepare for child birth.  It gets heavier as the pregnancy progresses.  I knew both times that I was pregnant before my period was due because of the milky/creamy consistency.  I also found that if I wasn't pregnant, the pre-mentrual discharge would be clear, and eventually would become bloodstreaked, beginning the period.  If it's whitish, chances are you are pregnant! Good luck!|`|20bbc93f4fb57e6221c9cb10de6bbf23aa	Cervical mucus also changes throughout your cycle in response to hormonal changes.  Many women notice that these changes occur with a predictable pattern.  Right after your period when your hormone levels are low, the fluid tends to be scant and not very wet.  It will then change after a few days and may become sticky or rubbery, followed by a creamy, milky discharge.  If you are ovulatory, you may begin to notice an egg white discharge that is stretchable.  This is your most fertile period.   If you do not conceive, the discharge should again change to a scant, less wet discharge similar to the beginning of your cycle.<br>  <br>  A few things that can make interpretation of the cervical mucus difficult include vaginal infections, the presence of seminal fluid, arousal fluid, spermicides and lubricants, anovulatory cycles, and using antihistamines (which tend to decrease the amount of discharge).  Try to check the discharge throughout the day, making it a routine part of the day|`|83e7118bf02a9d9ee612540aaa23f0ecaa	I can't answer this question, only offer my own experience as of now...  I am 2 days late with my period and also have the same discharge; I wondered myself if you can have discharge even if you are pregnant.  I know that I had none for like a week after ovulation and then it started slowly showing up like the discharge I have right before my period - although it changed slightly in its consistency in the last few days.  How late are you? OR How close are you to your period?  Try a test that gives results a week before your missed - if it's negative, hold out and try again if you miss your period.<br>  <br>  Good luck to both of us! :0)  btw I took a preg test 2 days before my period was due & it was neg but I'm still hoping!|`|ef347bce99398dd231f1bec1210bf333aa	the white discharge is a sign you are ovulating! that ;s the best time to try to conceive :)  read toni weschler's book "taking charge of your fertility"  it's a great book and it helped me a lot.|`|617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	That kind of fluid can be present at the time of ovulation.  However, you can also experience it just before a period, or even during very early pregnancy.<br>  <br>  The symptoms are very much the same; nausea, breast tenderness, cramping, etc, can all be felt at those three times.  This type of discharge or cervical mucus is the same.  Unfortunately those are the exact three times women want to tell apart!<br>  <br>  Since you're not ovulating, you're either pregnant or about to get your period.  It could be either.  You'll just have to wait and see.|`|AA10762620	let me see=what is white discharge while having relations?

cefbd88d09d4432dbf4bd68279e5e426aa	Did the tests come from the same package?  They might have been bad.  <br>  Here is a good site for HPTs   www.peeonastick.com|`|bd7916f66e290773a4982988feda532eaa	You could be pregnant still. Wait on your blood test results!<br>  <br>  Some women have tested + too early and end up having what they think is their period later when they actually had a miscarriage. (Chemical pregnancy)<br>  <br>  Doctors offices don't always have the most sensitive tests so I am betting that they were wrong. Have you tried taking another HPT?<br>  <br>  it isn't over until the fat lady sings!! Good Luck!|`|fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	No, the only ways to produce the hormone is through pregnancy or medication. Maybe when you tested at the doctor's office, you didn't have a high enough concentration in your urine. You should get your results from your blood test on the same day. Good Luck!!!|`|AA11226298	Nope, the beta hCG hormone is produced only during pregnancy, or administered by medication.  Two positive HPTs sounds like pregnancy to me.  Best wishes!|`|22ff0e123ffb20f91023f4e47ce57b20aa	Are you having bad morning sickness?  if so you could have what is called a molar pregnancy.  there are two kinds a compleate witch is were the egg dropps with no genetic make up and when it get fertilized it becomes a group of repidly mulitpying cells and causes your HGC level to sky rocket.  If you have a compleate molar then if you have a vaginal ultra sound they will see nothing.  Then there is a partial molar where the egg drops and tries to split into twins but something goes wrong and they do not devlop.  I do not know as much about this one.  <br>  this is a very serious condition that could cause cancer and will requier a D&C to remove the cells

fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	In Vitro Fertilization is a very lengthy process which is expensive, tiring and very emotional. In a nutshell the process is as follows:<br>  <br>  You will start by taking birth control pills (You read that right). This regulates your period until the process starts. Usually you will double-up on the packs. For example, you may take six straight weeks of pills. <br>  <br>  They will also start you on a medication called Synarel. You will start this before you stop your birth control pills and before you start your period. This is a nasal spray that stops your ovaries from producing eggs. This spray is very bad tasting.<br>  <br>  Once you start your period, you begin having regular ultrasounds and blood tests (Every one to two days). You will also start your daily injections. Your medication and dosage will depend on your doctor and your body. You could take these injections for anywhere from 5 to 10 days. These shots are given into the belly. You will have to mix and administer your own medications. These shots tell your ovaries to produce a large number of eggs.<br>  <br>  Once your ovaries have produced eggs and your follicles are the right size, you will undergo surgery. You will be put under IV sedation. A needle will be inserted into your ovaries to retreive your eggs through your vaginal cavity. While this procedure is taking place, your husband will be making his sperm donation. You will be required to have someone drive you home and you must stay off your feet for the remainder of the day.<br>  <br>  Your eggs and your husband's sperm will be combined in a lab. The embryos will grow there for 3 to 5 days. Depending on the number of embryos that survive, their condition and your preferences, you will be implanted with one to three embryos. This procedure is quite painless. The embryos are inserted directly into your uterus through a small tube. You will be told to relax for the remainder of the day.<br>  <br>  You will then take a shot everyday until you confirm that you are not pregnant or until the fetus's heartbeat is detected. This shot is oil. You will give yourself this shot everyday in the leg or the buttock.<br>  <br>  Depending on your ability to give yourself shots and your pain tolerance for shots, IVF isn't necessarily painful. I didn't find it painful. But even it was, if you want a baby bad enough, you would do it regardless of the pain.<br>  <br>  For more details on the process, I recommend speaking with your doctor directly, doing research on the internet and buying some books on the subject. Good Luck|`|ba30c9b84725091dfcbb402b4a73f45aaa	you first have to get hormone treatments, then you have to get the embryo implanted in you, and more hormone treatments.  I've heard it is a quite long process, and can be painful in some procedures, also the hormones would mess you up too.

If your parents think that you are to old to go trick or treating why not suggest to them that you have a Halloween party for you and your friends.  You will have just as much fun as if you went out (probably more) and your friends who are most likely your age will appreciate it as well. Good luck|`|AA11712072	14 is when to stop trick or treating.|`|AA11491405	fifteen, sixteen or thereabouts|`|a6fdb866f5ed77cbd10317ad9a8602f2aa	around 13 or 14
T0gv52CDaa	I remember the nurse talking to my husband and I before we left the hospital saying that lips turning blue is a sign of lack of oxegen and that we should call 911 immediately if we see that.  Since it was in the hospital when you saw it, I'm assuming they checked that, but I would keep nagging them until they can give you a good explaination.|`|tecPZUq2aa	No This Sounds Like Bad Circulation.

It would not affect the embryo unless the ulcer or gastritis is so unbearable that you cannot eat properly.  If it is preventing you from eating and drinking nutritious items, then your baby could become malnourished and fail to develop properly.<br>  <br>  If this is the case, you'd have to be extra-sure to take prenatal vitamins and try to eat as well as possible.  If your doctor's treating it, you should be able to eat well soon and it would be fine.

krQiDGCHaa	I don't think there is much you can do.  My husband has a borderline sperm count, meaning it's ALMOST low, but not quite.<br>  <br>  Doggy style sex, or missionary allow for deeper penetration and allow the sperm to be deposited closer to the cervix, which is good.<br>  <br>  Also, vitamin E is supposed to be good to take for your sperm count -- try taking some vitamins with vitamin E.<br>  <br>  Another good idea I heard about is called "Preseed."  It's a lubricant that you use while having sex, and it is supposed to envelope the sperm and help it travel to the egg.  Hubby and I just bought some, so that may help!<br>  <br>  Also, try having sex every OTHER day when ovulating instead of every day.  If you have sex every other day instead, it allows your sperm count to grow a little higher, helping your chances.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|smsUZG4Iaa	well good positions are ones that bring you close to the cervix like : missionary or doggy style.. i don't know about producing more semen, however, you can do things do protect the ones you've got. like wear loose underwear, don't take hot showers or baths. heat kills sperm along with alcohol and other drugs such as marijuana. if you both orgasm she will draw your sperm into her by contracting her cervix. she also needs to stay laying with her pelvis elevated on a pillow or something like that. i hope this helped you a little bit, good luck.|`|tdNfQWaAaa	I have heard that just taking a multivitamin or vitamin C will help. Maybe not actually INCREASE your sperm count, just make them healthier and more swimable. hehe. I would say either doggy-style or missionary would be best. And have her lay with a pillow under her and angle herself where her pelvis is up a little to help keep the sperm in. Hope this helps! Best of luck to you both!!!|`|xs4LRl1Paa	take sudafed! the ingredients in it enhances motility and sperm count! GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS!|`|vigFmfLmaa	There are old wives tales and herbal supplements that are supposed to help.  Basically it boils down to physiology, environment and nutrition.  If you don't have sperm you just don't have them.  You should limit extrenuous exercise, excessive alcohol and smoking (altogether for everyone's sake really), hot tub/sauna use, bicycling, briefs or any other hot, restrictive and/or injuring environment for the testicles.  They work properly when they are less than body temp (which is why they are external).  It's been said that zinc and other supplements increase sperm quality but really you should just try to eat a balanced diet and take a daily multivitamin.  Like I said, nothing is going to make sperm magically appear or attack your wife's eggs.<br>  <br>  If you really want to do something go have a semen analysis done.  It's the easiest, least invasive, least expensive fertility test a couple can do (about $75-100 at most clinics).  And lucky you don't even have to be in stirrups to do it!  You need to know when your wife's ovulating too.  Having sex every single day might be fun but she's not going to be fertile 31 straight days.
o5o4LXVwaa	I had bad pain in my ovaries that would double me over and I couldn't stand up straight it hurt so much. I had a golf ball sized cyst on my right ovary and endometriosis on the left side. Not everyone gets sick when their pregnant I never did. Take a pregnancy test if there's a chance you could be pregnant.|`|oHNrktxTaa	It could be a number of things.

b3571242ce7bcad1d85a8ae85156993eaa	As the other ladies have said, you will have to answer a lot of medical history questions, so if you know the dates of your periods, you will want to bring that info.<br>  <br>  Your husband will probably have to do give a sample for a sperm analysis, which means he will go off to a private room full of porn (pardon me for being blunt) and have all of the time he needs to "produce a specimen."<br>  <br>  You will probably have an ultrasound.  I was really surprised when I had my first ultrasound.  They insert a wand into your vagina and the doctor moves it around to view different parts of your womb.  It is kind of embarassing but cool to see on the screen.  It will help him determine if you have any fibroids, cysts, or uterine abnormalities.  This is done in a pivate room with a nurse to witness.<br>  <br>  You might also have to have your blood drawn on the first visit to have your FSH level determined.  FSH is a hormone that reflects how many eggs you have left to ovulate, and the FSH level is an important tool in deciding how your doctor will move forward with your treatment.<br>  <br>  I remember how scary that first appointment was, but I also remember how excited I felt when I left.  It is a great first step to taking charge of you reproductive future, and I hope it all goes well for you.|`|6f015f5d2e74a59b70f021a482086ff4aa	They are going to ask you a lot of questions and maybe even do a pelvic ultrasound at least that is what they did with me to check my ovaries and cervix and they laid out options as far as the different meds and what not, different therapies,  they actually put me on Birth Control pills, it was weird.  Still have not conceived but still trying.  oh they may say they want sperm test with hubby as well.  Really just ask what ever comes to mind. They will look at your insurance options as well.  I hope all goes good for you...  Good Luck|`|fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	You can expect to be at your first visit for a while. You and your partner will give a thorough medical history. The women will be given a physical examination and an ultrasound. They will also do some blood work. The man can expect to give a semen sample for analysis. You doc will most likely sit with you and discuss the different types of infertility and treatments available. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't expect an answer to your infertility on your first visit. It took me and my husband several visits until they determined the reasons behind our problem. Good Luck!|`|AA12381247	Original Article:<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/infertility/DS00310" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/inferti...</a> <br>   <br>  Infertility<br>  Introduction<br>  You and your partner have tried for months, perhaps for even more than a year. But despite sexual intercourse without birth control, you've been unable to conceive a child.<br>  If you've been trying to conceive for more than a year, there's a good chance that something may be interfering with your efforts to have a child. Infertility, also known as subfertility, is the inability to conceive a child within one year. Infertility may be due to a single cause in either you or your partner, or a combination of factors that may prevent a pregnancy from occurring or continuing.<br>  Infertility differs from sterility. Being sterile means you're unable to conceive a child. With sterility, you or your partner has a physical problem that precludes the ability to conceive. A diagnosis of infertility simply means that becoming pregnant may be a challenge rather than an impossibility.<br>  Signs and symptoms<br>  Most men with fertility problems have no signs or symptoms. Some men with hormonal problems may note a change in their voice or pattern of hair growth, enlargement of their breasts, or difficulty with sexual function. Infertility in women may be signaled by irregular menstrual periods or associated with conditions that cause pain during menstruation or intercourse.<br>  Causes<br>   <br>  The human reproductive process is complex. To accomplish a pregnancy, the intricate processes of ovulation and fertilization need to work just right. For many couples attempting pregnancy, something goes wrong in one or both of these complex processes and causes infertility. Because of the intricate series of events required to begin a pregnancy, many factors may cause a delay in starting your family.<br>  Every month the pituitary gland in a woman's brain sends a signal to her ovaries to prepare an egg for ovulation. The pituitary hormones — follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) — are involved in stimulating the ovaries to bring an egg to ovulation. A large boost in LH carries a message to the ovarian follicle to release its egg (ovulate). A woman is most fertile at the time of ovulation — around day 14 of her menstrual cycle — although the exact time of ovulation varies among women due to different lengths of menstrual cycles.<br>  The egg is then captured by a fallopian tube and is viable for about 24 hours, but its best chance of being fertilized is within the first 12 hours following ovulation. For pregnancy to occur, a sperm must unite with the egg in the fallopian tube during this time. Sperm are capable of fertilizing the egg for up to 72 hours and must be present in the fallopian tube at the same time as the egg for conception to occur. If fertilized, the egg moves into the uterus two to four days later. There it attaches to the uterine lining and begins a nine-month process of growth.<br>  In order for a sperm to reach an egg, many factors are involved in the male fertility process. There must be enough sperm, they must be of the right shape and they must move in the right way. There must be enough semen to transport the sperm. The man also needs to be able to have an erection, and must be able to ejaculate the semen and deliver it into the vagina.<br>  The cause or causes of infertility can involve one or both partners. For many couples having problems with fertility, the male partner is either the sole or a contributing cause. Problems with female fertility are common as well, but present less often than those in the male partner. In both men and women, multiple factors can account for difficulty with fertility. Sometimes the problem isn't really one of infertility, but a more general sexual problem such as erectile dysfunction. Other times, the problem may involve an abnormality in the structure of the reproductive hormones or organs. Certain infections and diseases also can affect fertility.<br>  Causes of male infertility<br>  A number of causes exist for male infertility that may result in impaired sperm count or mobility, or impaired ability to fertilize the egg. The most common causes of male infertility include abnormal sperm production or function, impaired delivery of sperm, conditions related to a man's general health and lifestyle, and overexposure to certain environmental elements:<br>  Abnormal sperm production or function. Most cases of male infertility are due to sperm abnormalities, such as:<br>  ·Impaired shape and movement of sperm. Sperm must be properly shaped and able to move rapidly and accurately toward the egg for fertilization to occur. If the shape and structure (morphology) of the sperm are abnormal or the movement (motility) is impaired, sperm may not be able to reach the egg. <br>  ·Absent sperm production in testicles. Complete failure of the testicles to produce sperm is rare, affecting very few infertile men. <br>  ·Low sperm concentration. A normal sperm concentration is greater than or equal to 20 million sperm per milliliter of semen. A count of 10 million or fewer sperm per milliliter of semen indicates low sperm concentration (subfertility). A count of 40 million sperm or higher per milliliter of semen indicates increased fertility. <br>  ·Varicocele. A varicocele is a varicose vein in the scrotum that may prevent normal cooling of the testicle and raise testicular temperature, preventing sperm from surviving. <br>  ·Undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). This occurs when one or both testicles fail to descend from the abdomen into the scrotum during fetal development. Undescended testicles can cause mild to severely impaired sperm production. Because the testicles are exposed to the higher internal body temperature compared to the temperature in the scrotum, sperm production may be affected. <br>  ·Testosterone deficiency (male hypogonadism). Infertility can result from disorders of the testicles themselves, or an abnormality affecting the hypothalamus or pituitary glands in the brain that produce the hormones that control the testicles. <br>  ·Klinefelter's syndrome. In this disorder of the sex chromosomes, a man has two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome instead of one X and one Y. This causes abnormal development of the testicles, resulting in low or absent sperm production. Testosterone production also may be lower. <br>  ·Infections. Infection may temporarily affect sperm motility. Repeated bouts of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, are most often associated with male infertility. These infections can cause scarring and block sperm passage. Mycoplasma is an organism that may fasten itself to sperm cells, making them less motile. If mumps, a viral infection usually affecting young children, occurs after puberty, inflammation of the testicles can impair sperm production. Inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis), urethra or epididymis also may alter sperm motility. <br>  In many instances, no cause for reduced sperm production is found. When sperm concentration is less than 5 million per milliliter of semen, genetic causes could be involved. A blood test can reveal whether there are subtle changes in the Y chromosome.<br>  Impaired delivery of sperm. Problems with the delivery of sperm from the penis into the vagina can cause infertility. These may include:<br>  ·Sexual issues. Often treatable, problems with sexual intercourse or technique may affect fertility. Difficulties with erection of the penis (erectile dysfunction), premature ejaculation, painful intercourse (dyspareunia), or psychological or relationship problems can contribute to infertility. Use of lubricants such as oils or petroleum jelly can be toxic to sperm and impair fertility. <br>  ·Retrograde ejaculation. This occurs when semen enters the bladder during orgasm rather than emerging out through the penis. Various conditions can cause retrograde ejaculation including diabetes, bladder, prostate or urethral surgery, and the use of psychiatric or antihypertensive drugs. <br>  ·Blockage of epididymis or ejaculatory ducts. Some men are born with blockage of the part of the testicle that contains sperm (epididymis) or ejaculatory ducts. And some men who seek treatment for infertility lack the tubes that carry sperm (vasa deferentia). <br>  ·No semen (ejaculate). The absence of ejaculate may occur in men with spinal cord injuries or diseases. This fluid transports sperm through the penis into the vagina. <br>  ·Misplaced urinary opening (hypospadias). A birth defect can cause the urinary (urethral) opening to be abnormally located on the underside of the penis. If not surgically corrected, this condition can prevent sperm from reaching the cervix. <br>  ·Anti-sperm antibodies. Antibodies that target sperm and weaken or disable them usually occur after surgical blockage of part of the vas deferens for male sterilization (vasectomy). Presence of these antibodies may complicate the reversal of a vasectomy. <br>  ·Cystic fibrosis. Men with cystic fibrosis often have missing or obstructed vasa deferentia. <br>  General health and lifestyle. A man's general health and lifestyle may affect fertility. Some common causes of infertility related to health and lifestyle include:<br>  ·Emotional stress. Stress may interfere with certain hormones needed to produce sperm. Your sperm count may be affected if you experience excessive or prolonged emotional stress. A problem with fertility itself can sometimes become long term and discouraging, producing more stress. Infertility can affect social relationships and sexual functioning. <br>  ·Malnutrition. Deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamin C, selenium, zinc and folate may contribute to infertility. <br>  ·Obesity. Increased body mass may be associated with fertility problems in men. <br>  ·Cancer and its treatment. Both radiation and chemotherapy treatment for cancer can impair sperm production, sometimes severely. The closer radiation treatment is to the testicles, the higher the risk of infertility. Removal of one or both testicles due to cancer also may affect male fertility. You may want to consider freezing (cryopreserving) your sperm before cancer treatment to ensure future fertility. <br>  ·Alcohol and drugs. Alcohol or drug dependency can be associated with general ill health and reduced fertility. The use of certain drugs also can contribute to infertility. Anabolic steroids, for example, which are taken to stimulate muscle strength and growth, can cause the testicles to shrink and sperm production to decrease. <br>  ·Other medical conditions. A severe injury or major surgery can affect male fertility. Certain diseases or conditions, such as diabetes, thyroid disease, HIV/AIDS, Cushing's syndrome, anemia, heart attack, and liver or kidney failure, may be associated with infertility. <br>  ·Age. A gradual decline in fertility is common in men older than 35. <br>  Environmental exposure. Overexposure to certain environmental elements such as heat, toxins and chemicals can reduce sperm count either directly by affecting testicular function or indirectly by altering the male hormonal system. Specific causes include:<br>  ·Pesticides and other chemicals. Herbicides and insecticides may cause female hormone-like effects in the male body and may be associated with reduced sperm production. Exposure to such chemicals also may contribute to testicular cancer. Men exposed to hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene, benzene, toluene, xylen and aromatic solvents used in paint, varnishes, glues, metal degreasers and other products, may be at risk of infertility. Men with high exposure to lead also may be more at risk. <br>  ·Testicular exposure to overheating. Frequent use of saunas or hot tubs can elevate your core body temperature. This may impair your sperm production and lower your sperm count. <br>  ·Substance abuse. Cocaine or heavy marijuana use may temporarily reduce the number and quality of your sperm. <br>  ·Tobacco smoking. Men who smoke may have a lower sperm count than do those who don't smoke. <br>  Causes of female infertility<br>  The most common causes of female infertility include fallopian tube damage or blockage, endometriosis, ovulation disorders, elevated prolactin, polycystic ovary syndrome, early menopause, benign uterine fibroids and pelvic adhesions:<br>  Fallopian tube damage or blockage. This condition usually results from inflammation of the fallopian tube (salpingitis). Chlamydia is the most frequent cause. Tubal inflammation may go unnoticed or cause pain and fever.<br>  Tubal damage with scarring is the major risk factor of a pregnancy in which the fertilized egg is unable to make its way through the fallopian tube to implant in the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). One episode of tubal infection may cause fertility difficulties. The risk of ectopic pregnancy increases with each occurrence of tubal infection.<br>  Endometriosis. Endometriosis occurs when the tissue that makes up the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus. This tissue most commonly is implanted on the ovaries or the lining of the abdomen near the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. These implants respond to the hormonal cycle and grow, shed and bleed in sync with the lining of the uterus each month, which can lead to scarring and inflammation. Pelvic pain and infertility are common in women with endometriosis.<br>  Infertility in endometriosis also may be due to:<br>  ·Ovarian cysts (endometriomas). Ovarian cysts may indicate advanced endometriosis and often are associated with reduced fertility. Endometriomas can be treated with surgery. <br>  ·Scar tissue. Endometriosis may cause rigid webs of scar tissue between the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes. This may prevent the transfer of the egg to the fallopian tube. <br>  Ovulation disorders. Some cases of female infertility are caused by ovulation disorders. Disruption in the part of the brain that regulates ovulation (hypothalamic-pituitary axis) can cause deficiencies in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Even slight irregularities in the hormone system can affect ovulation.<br>  Specific causes of hypothalamic-pituitary disorders include:<br>  ·Direct injury to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland <br>  ·Pituitary tumors <br>  ·Excessive exercise <br>  ·Anorexia nervosa <br>  Elevated prolactin (hyperprolactinemia). The hormone prolactin stimulates breast milk production. High levels in women who aren't pregnant or nursing may affect ovulation. An elevation in prolactin levels may also indicate the presence of a pituitary tumor. In addition, some drugs can elevate levels of prolactin. Milk flow not related to pregnancy or nursing (galactorrhea) can be a sign of high prolactin.<br>  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). An increase in androgen hormone production causes PCOS. In women with increased body mass, elevated androgen production may come from stimulation by higher levels of insulin. In lean women, the elevated levels of androgen may be stimulated by a higher ratio of luteinizing hormone (LH). Lack of menstruation (amenorrhea) or infrequent menses (oligomenorrhea) are common symptoms in women with PCOS.<br>  In PCOS, increased androgen production prevents the follicles of the ovaries from producing a mature egg. Small follicles that start to grow but can't mature to ovulation remain within the ovary. A persistent lack of ovulation may lead to mild enlargement of the ovaries.<br>  Without ovulation, the hormone progesterone isn't produced and estrogen levels remain constant. Elevated levels of androgen may cause increased dark or thick hair on the chin, upper lip or lower abdomen as well as acne and oily skin.<br>  Early menopause (premature ovarian failure). Early menopause is the absence of menstruation and the early depletion of ovarian follicles before age 35. Although the cause is often unknown, certain conditions are associated with early menopause, including:<br>  ·Autoimmune disease. The body produces antibodies to attack its own tissue, in this case the ovary. This may be associated with hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone). <br>  ·Radiation or chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer. <br>  ·Tobacco smoking. <br>  Benign uterine fibroids.Fibroids are benign tumors in the wall of the uterus and are common in women in their 30s. Occasionally they may cause infertility by interfering with the contour of the uterine cavity, blocking the fallopian tubes.<br>  Pelvic adhesions. Pelvic adhesions are bands of scar tissue that bind organs after pelvic infection, appendicitis, or abdominal or pelvic surgery. They may limit the functioning of the ovaries and fallopian tubes and impair fertility. Scar tissue formation inside the uterine cavity after a surgical procedure may result in a closed uterus and ceased menstruation (Asherman's syndrome). This is most common following surgery to control uterine bleeding after giving birth.<br>  Other causes. A number of other causes can lead to infertility in women:<br>  ·Medications. Temporary infertility may occur with the use of certain medications. In most cases, fertility is restored when the medication is stopped. <br>  ·Thyroid problems. Disorders of the thyroid gland, either too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) or too little (hypothyroidism), can interrupt the menstrual cycle and cause infertility. <br>  ·Cancer and its treatment. Certain cancers — particularly female reproductive cancers — often severely impair female fertility. Both radiation and chemotherapy may affect a woman's ability to reproduce. Chemotherapy may impair reproductive function and fertility more severely in men than in women. <br>  ·Other medical conditions. Medical conditions associated with delayed puberty or amenorrhea, such as Cushing's disease, sickle cell disease, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease and diabetes, can affect a woman's fertility. <br>  Risk factors<br>  Many of the risk factors for both male and female infertility are the same. They include:<br>  ·Age. Age is the strongest predictor of female fertility. After about age 32, a woman's fertility potential gradually declines. A woman does not renew her oocytes (eggs). Infertility in older women may be due to a higher risk of chromosomal abnormalities that occur in the eggs as they age. Older women are also more likely to have health problems that may interfere with fertility. The risk of miscarriage also increases with a woman's age. A gradual decline in fertility is possible in men older than 35. <br>  ·Tobacco smoking. Women who smoke tobacco may reduce their chances of becoming pregnant and the possible benefit of fertility treatment. Miscarriages are more frequent in women who smoke. <br>  ·Alcohol. There's no certain level of safe alcohol use during conception or pregnancy. <br>  ·Body mass. Extremes in body mass — either too high (body mass index, or BMI, of greater than 25.0) or too low (BMI of lower than 20.0) — may affect ovulation and increase the risk of infertility. <br>  ·Being overweight. Among American women, infertility often is due to a sedentary lifestyle and being overweight. <br>  ·Being underweight. Women at risk include those with eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia, and women following a very low-calorie or restrictive diet. Strict vegetarians also may experience infertility problems due to a lack of important nutrients such as vitamin B-12, zinc, iron and folic acid. Marathon runners, dancers and others who exercise very intensely are more prone to menstrual irregularities and infertility. <br>  When to seek medical advice<br>  In general, don't be concerned about infertility unless you and your partner have been trying regularly to conceive for at least one year. However, if you plan to conceive and you're a woman older than 30 or haven't had a menstrual flow for longer than six months, seek a medical evaluation. If you have a history of irregular or painful menstrual cycles, pelvic pain, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or repeated miscarriages, schedule a consultation with your doctor sooner. If you're a man with a low sperm count or a history of testicular, prostate or sexual problems, consider seeking help earlier.<br>  Screening and diagnosis<br>  If you and your partner are unable to achieve conception within a reasonable time and would like to do so, seek help. The woman's gynecologist, the man's urologist or your family doctor can determine whether there's a problem that requires a specialist or clinic that treats infertility problems.<br>  Some infertile couples have more than one cause of their infertility. Thus, your doctor will usually begin a comprehensive infertility examination of both you and your partner.<br>  Before undergoing infertility testing, be aware that a certain amount of commitment is required. Your doctor or clinic will need to determine what your sexual habits are and may make recommendations about how you may need to change those habits. The tests and periods of trial and error may extend over several months.<br>  Evaluation is expensive and in some cases involves operations and uncomfortable procedures, and the expenses may not be reimbursed by many medical plans. Finally, there's no guarantee, even after all testing and counseling, that conception will occur. However, for couples who are eager to have their own child, such an evaluation is best. It may result in a successful pregnancy.<br>  Tests for men<br>  For a man to be fertile, the testicles must produce enough healthy sperm, and the sperm must be ejaculated effectively into the woman's vagina. Tests for male infertility attempt to determine whether any of these processes are impaired.<br>  ·General physical examination. This includes examination of your genitals and questions concerning your medical history, illnesses and disabilities, medications and sexual habits. <br>  ·Semen analysis. Your doctor may ask for a specimen of ejaculated semen. This is generally obtained by masturbating or by interrupting intercourse and ejaculating your semen into a clean container. Your doctor will provide instructions. Such a specimen may be required more than once. A laboratory analyzes your semen specimen for quantity, color and presence of infections or blood. Detailed analysis of the sperm also is done. The laboratory will determine the number of sperm present and any abnormalities in the shape and movement (motility) of the sperm. Often sperm counts fluctuate from one specimen to the next. <br>  ·Hormone testing. A blood test to determine the level of testosterone and other male hormones is common. <br>  Tests for women<br>  For a woman to be fertile, the ovaries must release healthy eggs regularly, and her reproductive tract must allow the eggs and sperm to pass into her fallopian tubes for a possible union. Her reproductive organs must be healthy and functional.<br>  After your doctor asks questions regarding your health history, menstrual cycle and sexual habits, you'll undergo a general physical examination. This includes a regular gynecologic examination. Specific fertility tests may include:<br>  ·Confirmation of ovulation. A blood test is sometimes performed to determine the levels of hormones involved in successful ovulation. <br>  ·Hysterosalpingography. This test evaluates the condition of your uterus and fallopian tubes. Fluid is injected into your uterus, and an X-ray is taken to determine whether the fluid progresses out of the uterus and into your fallopian tubes and general peritoneal cavity. Blockage or problems often can be located and may be corrected with medication or surgery. <br>  ·Laparoscopy. Performed under general anesthesia, this surgical procedure involves inserting a thin viewing device into your abdomen and pelvis to examine your fallopian tubes, ovaries and uterus. A small incision (8 to 10 millimeters) is made beneath your navel, and a needle is inserted into your abdominal cavity. A small amount of gas (usually carbon dioxide) is inserted into the abdomen to create space for entry of the laparoscope — an illuminated, fiber-optic telescope. <br>  The most common problems identified by laparoscopy are endometriosis and scarring. Your doctor can also detect blockages or irregularities of the fallopian tubes and uterus. Often a blue dye is injected into the cervical canal and through the uterus and fallopian tubes to determine whether they are open. At the end of the procedure, the gas and laparoscope are drawn out and the incision is closed. Laparoscopy generally is done on an outpatient basis.<br>  ·Basal body temperature. Although this test was once a standard, basal body temperature charting is used less often today. Charting a woman's body temperature doesn't give as precise time of ovulation as earlier believed. <br>  ·Urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) detector kits. A number of at-home kits are available to test your LH level. Although these kits may be helpful, they also can be inaccurate and misleading. Consult your doctor before using one. <br>  ·Ovarian reserve testing. Testing may be done to determine the potential effectiveness of the eggs after ovulation. This approach often begins with hormone testing early in a woman's menstrual cycle. <br>  Not everyone needs to undergo all, or even many, of these tests before the cause of infertility is found. Which tests are used and their sequence depend on discussion and agreement between you and your doctor.<br>  Unexplained infertility<br>  In some infertile couples, no specific cause is found (unexplained infertility). Couples receiving the diagnosis of unexplained infertility are more likely to seek multiple health care providers and be influenced by the experiences of family and friends or literature that promises new hope. Although infertility is unexplained, the pregnancy rate for these couples is among the highest.<br>  Complications<br>  Complications of being infertile often involve strong emotions and may trigger negative feelings between you and your partner. These may include:<br>  ·Depression <br>  ·Guilt <br>  ·Anger <br>  ·Stress <br>  ·Disappointment <br>  ·Resentment <br>  ·Blame <br>  ·Fear of losing partner because of infertility <br>  ·Diminished confidence and self-esteem <br>  Treatment <br>  Treatment of infertility depends on the cause, the duration of the problem, the age of the partners and their specific wishes. Some causes of infertility can't be corrected. However, various means of insemination or embryo transfer may be possible so that a woman can still become pregnant.<br>  Nonsurgical fertility treatment falls into two main categories:<br>  ·Restoring or bringing about fertility <br>  ·Assisted reproductive technology (ART) <br>  Restoring or bringing about fertility<br>  These approaches can involve steps related to the male or to the female, or both.<br>  Sperm survive in the female reproductive tract for up to 72 hours, and an egg can be fertilized for up to 24 hours after ovulation. Increasing the frequency of intercourse increases the chances for conception.<br>  Other approaches that involve the male include:<br>  ·Treatment of general sexual problems. Addressing impotence or premature ejaculation can improve fertility. Treatment for these problems often is with medication or behavioral approaches. <br>  ·Addressing lack of sperm. When the source of infertility lies in the man's sperm, or lack of it, restoring or initiating fertility is sometimes possible. For example, in some instances, surgical correction of a varicocele will restore fertility. Problems with the testicles, prostate gland, seminal vesicle and urethra also can be treated. When sperm production is impaired because of damage to the sperm-producing areas of the testicle, drug treatment has little benefit. In rare instances when sperm production is impaired because of a pituitary problem, treatment with pituitary hormones called gonadotropins may help. When infection hampers sperm production, both you and your partner will need treatment. <br>  Fertility drugs (ovulation induction)<br>  Fertility drugs are the primary treatment for women who are infertile due to ovulation disorders. These medications regulate or induce ovulation. In general, they exert actions designed to work like natural follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Commonly used fertility drugs include:<br>  ·Clomiphene citrate (Clomid, Serophene). This drug is taken orally and stimulates ovulation in women who have PCOS or other ovulatory disorders. It causes the pituitary gland to release more FSH and LH, which stimulate the growth of an ovarian follicle containing an egg. <br>  ·Human menopausal gonadotropin, or hMG (Repronex, Pergonal). This injected prescription medication is for women who don't menstruate on their own due to the failure of the pituitary gland to stimulate ovulation. Unlike clomiphene, which stimulates the pituitary gland, hMG and other gonadotropins directly stimulate the ovaries. This drug contains both FSH and LH. <br>  ·Follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH (Gonal-F, Follistim, Bravelle). FSH is essentially hMG without the LH. Like hMG, it works by stimulating the ovaries to mature egg follicles. <br>  ·Human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG (Ovidrel, Pregnyl). Used in combination with clomiphene, hMG and FSH, this drug stimulates the follicle to release its egg (ovulate). <br>  ·Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) analogs. This treatment is for women with irregular ovulatory cycles or who ovulate prematurely — before the lead follicle is mature enough — during hMG treatment. Gn-RH analogs deliver constant Gn-RH to the pituitary gland, which alters hormone production, so that a physician can induce follicle growth with FSH. <br>  ·Letrozole (Femara). This drug is in a class of medications called aromatase inhibitors, which are approved for treatment of advanced breast cancer. Doctors sometimes prescribe letrozole for women who don't ovulate on their own and who haven't responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate. Letrozole is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for inducing ovulation. The drug's manufacturer has warned doctors not to use the drug for fertility purposes because of possible adverse health effects. These adverse effects may include birth defects and miscarriage. <br>  ·Metformin (Glucophage). This oral drug is taken to boost ovulation. It's used when insulin resistance is known or suspected. <br>  ·Bromocriptine. This medication is for women whose ovulation cycles are irregular due to elevated levels of prolactin, the hormone that stimulates milk production in new mothers. Bromocriptine inhibits prolactin production. <br>  Injectable fertility drugs significantly increase the chance of multiple births. The use of these drugs requires careful monitoring with a combination of blood tests of hormones and ultrasound measurement of ovarian follicle size. Generally, the greater the number of fetuses, the higher the risk of premature labor. Babies born prematurely are at increased risk of health and developmental problems. The risk is greater for triplets than it is for twins or single pregnancies.<br>  The risk of multiple pregnancies can be reduced. If a woman requires an hCG injection to trigger ovulation, and ultrasound exams show that too many follicles have developed, she and her doctor can decide to withhold the hCG injection. For many couples, however, the desire to become pregnant overrides concerns about conceiving multiple babies.<br>  When too many babies are conceived, removal of one or more fetuses (multifetal pregnancy reduction) can offer improved survival odds for the surviving fetuses. This presents serious emotional and ethical challenges for many people. If you and your partner are considering fertility drug treatment, discuss this possibility with your doctor before starting treatment.<br>  There may be a link between fertility drugs and an increased, long-term risk of ovarian cancer. However, the association between fertility drugs and ovarian cancer hasn't been confirmed.<br>  Surgery<br>  Depending on the cause, surgery may be a treatment option for infertility. Blockages or other problems in the fallopian tubes usually can be surgically repaired. Laparoscopy allows delicate operations on the fallopian tubes.<br>  Infertility due to endometriosis often is more difficult to treat. Although hormones such as those found in birth control pills are effective for treating endometriosis and relieving pain, they haven't been useful in treating infertility. If you have endometriosis, your doctor may treat you with ovulation therapy, in which medication is used to stimulate or regulate ovulation, or in vitro fertilization, in which the egg and sperm are joined in the laboratory and transferred to the uterus.<br>  Assisted reproductive technology (ART)<br>  ART has revolutionized the treatment of infertility. Each year thousands of babies are born in the United States as a result of ART. Medical advances have enabled many couples to have their own biological child. An ART health team includes physicians, psychologists, embryologists, laboratory technicians, nurses and allied health professionals who work together to help infertile couples achieve pregnancy.<br>  The most common forms of ART include:<br>  ·In vitro fertilization (IVF). This is the most effective ART technique. IVF involves retrieving mature eggs from a woman, fertilizing them with a man's sperm in a dish in a laboratory and implanting the embryos in the uterus three to five days after fertilization. IVF often is recommended as a first-line therapy and is the treatment of choice if both fallopian tubes are blocked. It's also widely used for a number of other conditions, such as endometriosis, unexplained infertility, cervical factor infertility, male factor infertility and ovulation disorders. <br>  ·Electroejaculation. Electric stimulus brings about ejaculation to obtain semen. This procedure can be used in men with a spinal cord injury who can't otherwise achieve ejaculation. <br>  ·Surgical sperm aspiration. This technique involves removing sperm from part of the male reproductive tract such as the epididymis, vas deferens or testicle. This allows retrieval of sperm if blockage is present. <br>  ·Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). This technique consists of a microscopic technique (micromanipulation) in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg to achieve fertilization in conjunction with the standard IVF procedure. ICSI has been especially helpful in couples who have previously failed to achieve conception with standard techniques. For men with low sperm concentrations, ICSI dramatically improves the likelihood of fertilization. <br>  ·Assisted hatching. This technique attempts to assist the implantation of the embryo into the lining of the uterus. <br>  ART works best when the woman has a healthy uterus, responds well to fertility drugs, and ovulates naturally or uses donor eggs. The man should have healthy sperm, or donor sperm should be available. The success rate of ART gradually diminishes after age 32.<br>  Complications of treatment<br>  Certain complications exist with the treatment of infertility. These include:<br>  ·Multiple pregnancy. Although the most common complication of ART is multiple pregnancy, ART isn't the direct cause of a number of the extreme cases of septuplets or octuplets reported in the media. The number of quality embryos kept and matured to fetuses and birth ultimately is a decision made by the couple. If too many babies are conceived, the removal of one or more fetuses (multifetal pregnancy reduction) is possible to improve survival odds for the other fetuses. <br>  ·Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). If overstimulated, a woman's ovaries may enlarge and cause pain and bloating. Mild to moderate symptoms often resolve without treatment, although pregnancy may delay recovery. Rarely, fluid accumulates in the abdominal cavity and chest, causing abdominal swelling and shortness of breath. This accumulation of fluid can deplete blood volume and lower blood pressure. Severe cases require emergency treatment. Younger women and those who have polycystic ovary syndrome have a higher risk of developing OHSS than do other women. <br>  ·Bleeding or infection. As with any invasive procedure, there is a risk of bleeding or infection. <br>  ·Low birth weight. The greatest risk for low birth weight is a multiple pregnancy. In single live births, there may be a greater chance of low birth weight associated with ART. <br>  ·Birth defects. Significant concern exists regarding the possible relationship between ART and birth defects. More research is necessary to confirm these findings. Weigh this factor if you're considering whether to take advantage of this treatment. ART is the most successful fertility-enhancing therapy to date. <br>  Prevention<br>  Most types of male infertility aren't preventable. However, avoid drug and tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption, which may contribute to male infertility. Also, high temperatures can affect sperm production and motility. Although this effect is usually temporary, avoid hot tubs and steam baths.<br>  If you're a man who's uncertain about whether you would eventually like to become a father, don't undergo permanent sterilization, such as a vasectomy. Although surgery to reverse this condition is possible, risks are involved that could affect fertility in other ways.<br>  A woman can increase her chances of becoming pregnant in a number of ways:<br>  ·Exercise moderately. Regular exercise is important, but if you're exercising so intensely that your periods are infrequent or absent, your fertility is likely to be impaired. <br>  ·Avoid weight extremes. Being overweight or underweight can affect your hormone production and cause infertility. <br>  ·Avoid alcohol, tobacco and street drugs. These substances may impair your ability to conceive or produce a healthy child. Don't drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. Avoid illegal drugs such as marijuana and cocaine. <br>  ·Limit medications. The use of both prescription and nonprescription drugs can decrease your chance of getting pregnant or keeping a pregnancy. Talk with your doctor about any medications you take regularly. <br>  Coping skills<br>  Coping with infertility can be difficult. It's an issue of the unknown — you can't predict how long it will last or what the outcome will be. Infertility isn't necessarily solved with hard work. The emotional burden on a couple is considerable, and plans for coping can help.<br>  Planning for emotional turmoil<br>  ·Set limits. Decide in advance how many and what kind of procedures are emotionally and financially acceptable for you and your partner and attempt to determine a final limit. Fertility treatments may be expensive and often not covered by insurance companies, and a successful pregnancy often depends on repeated attempts. Some couples become so focused on treatment that they continue with fertility procedures until they are emotionally and financially drained. <br>  ·Consider other options. Determine alternatives — adoption, donor sperm or egg, or even having no children — as early as possible in the fertility process. This can reduce anxiety during treatments and feelings of hopelessness if conception doesn't occur. <br>  ·Talk about your feelings. Locate support groups or counseling services for help before and after treatment to help endure the process and ease the grief should treatment fail. <br>  Managing emotional stress during treatment<br>  ·Acupuncture. This ancient therapy may benefit couples who are undergoing fertility treatment. <br>  ·Practice relaxation. Cognitive behavior therapy, which uses methods that include relaxation training and stress management, has been associated with higher pregnancy rates. <br>  ·Express yourself. Reach out to others rather than repressing guilt or anger. <br>  ·Stay in touch with loved ones. Talking to your partner, family and friends can be very beneficial. The best support often comes from loved ones and those closest to you. <br>  Managing emotional effects of the outcome<br>  ·Failure. The emotional stress of failure can be devastating even on the most loving and affectionate relationships and for people who've prepared well for the possibility of failure. Don't hesitate to seek professional help if the emotional burdens become too heavy for you or your partner. <br>  ·Success. Some studies have indicated that even if fertility treatment is successful, women experience increased stress and fear of failure during pregnancy. Other research suggests that women who achieved pregnancy using fertility treatments felt increasingly better and had higher self-esteem and less anxiety as the pregnancy progressed than did women whose pregnancies didn't involve medical intervention. <br>  ·Multiple births. A successful pregnancy that results in multiple births introduces new complexities and emotional problems. The risk of depression is higher in women who have multiple births. <br>  ·Parenting. Once a child arrives, parents are more likely to be more anxious and have less confidence and self-esteem. Discuss becoming parents with your partner and plan for the many changes — challenging and rewarding — that a child will bring to your lives. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  By Mayo Clinic Staff <br>  Jun 15, 2006 <br>  ? 1998-2006 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

It made colorful and cheap art for the walls.<br>  <br>  Or, you could take photos of each of them, upload to a scrapbooking site (free) and then send your family and friends a CD when you are done.<br>  <br>  There is probably no way to do something with all of them (especially if you have loads like my son did) so just put the other stuff in an airproof container and save for when he's older.<br>  <br>  I did all of this and it worked wonderfully.|`|5nTMliTJaa	My mom always put my brother and I's art work into a big brown portfolio type thing.

I like saving things (kind of a pack rat) and I would want to hold on to them. I hope this helps.|`|GxV4jGKMaa	I like putting favorite pieces into photo albums.

I mean all kids act up, but that doesn't mean that they need medicine. <br>  <br>  My son is ADHD, and yes he is on medicine, but medicine isn't the only part to treating this, and some kids can do without the medicine. <br>  <br>  As far as medicine, my son did the best on concerta, but as you will learn with a adhd or add child alot of times after prolong use of medicine that they have to be changed because it becomes less effective for them over time and either the dosage has to be uped or they try a new medicine. <br>  <br>  My son i think has been on all of them, conterta, ritalin (which they have put him back on, he tried this at a very early age and it made him a zombie, and i didn't want that for my son), vaynesse (?spelling), adderall xr, adderall, foclin, foclin xr, and so forth. <br>  <br>  No medicine will make your child act out, it will help with some of the over hyperness, it will help with concertation, it will help with impulistvity, and so forth. It will not make them magically not act up or out. you have to do behavioral managment, counsling, and have very constient parenting. <br>  <br>  Add/ADHD is not something that is fixed in a pill for your child, it takes alot of time, patiences,compassion, and trial and error to see what works for your child. <br>  <br>  You will need to do alot of reading, and preparing your self as a parent to be able to help your child. But it also comes a point that your child can have the medicine, and all the resources that are avaible and good parenting, but he /she will have to make a effort to change his/her behavior as meaning that they take responability for their actions and not use add/adhd as a excuse to act out.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your child.|`|DxbaEPbUaa	yes, i have three children who have ADD. it is a very common illness that is easily controllable. get a referral from your primary care dr to see a child psychologist who can properly diagnose and treat your child.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	i think medication is just a cover up. all kids are hyper to an extent. <br>  <br>  if your kid respects you he/she will listen to you.|`|NUtB1SKsaa	I have much experience parenting kids with ADD; also am a Social Worker.  Yes, medication can really help kids, when prescribed by a child psychiatrist or pediatrician and the child is closely monitored.  <br>  <br>  There are several different types of meds and a good doctor might have to try different ones and amounts over time (trials).  Expect it.  Be sure to dispense the med to your child as prescribed and consistently!  Take contol.  Do not allow your child to have access to the pills.  You keep them at your disposal and you bring the proper amount to the school each month.  School nurses are usually the best part of the school experience.  Meet with the nurse.  Allow her/him to get to know and respect you.  It's one of the best strategies I can suggest!<br>  Keep informed, reach out for help.  Your child might benefit by counseling.  I believe that if you find a good therapist, that professional will be as helpful to you as to the child. Use them.  That is a very good thing. Be involved in the therapy in some capacity.  If you feel left out.  Get out and get another one!<br>  Seek out healthy and proactive techniques re:<br>  How to deal with outbursts-tantrums?   <br>  What kind of discipline to use?<br>  What should you try to ignore?  Pick your battles...<br>  - How to handle school issues and teachers - <br>  this is huge and can be extremely frustrating.  Be part of your child's educational experience.  Use the school counselor and special education programs, if necessary.<br>  <br>  Oh dear, I hope I'm not overwhelming you.  I just hope you do not think that medication is the cure all for ADD. It is a big job - raising kids - that is, especially those with ADD.  But you can really affect the outcome and avoid huge hassles during their teen years by being proactive now.  <br>  I wish you the very best!|`|AA11065140	We decided that manual behavior adjustments were better than raising a child on drugs.  There's a long-standing history of ADD in my family, and most of us have learned to handle it without medication.  We wanted our daughter to (a) grow up with a clear head, and (b) learn how to manage these problems on her own.<br>  <br>  Additionally, the medication at school became a bit of a stigma.  By hearing the teacher say things like, "Did you take your meds today?", gave the other kids the impression that she was abnormal.  It only took us about a week of trying Ritalin before we realized it was not the right option for her.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that ALL kids act out.  I won't tell you that you shouldn't medicate your child - all families are different, so that's your call.  But acting out is normal behavior for kids...when they do it, you should be sure to teach the lesson that goes with it.  The medication is too often used to make kids conform, and ends up hiding the real issue, which is that kids are kids.|`|gb4VzNXQaa	Everyone is different and different medications affect different people in different ways.  The only way to have a good idea of what medication might work for child is to talk to his or her doctor and also do your own research on the disorder.

rBwaAiYRaa	I have a sleepwalker.  He is 7 years old now, but I first found him doing it around age 4.  It scared the living crap out of me!<br>  <br>  When I find him sleepwalking, he appears drunk.  He sways, slurs his speech and mumbles incoherently.  Several times, I've caught him peeing in odd places, like next to the toilet or at the top of the stairs.  Like your son, he is completely unresponsive and will go right back to bed without objection.<br>  <br>  I've done some research, and was relieved to find that sleepwalking is fairly common in both children and adults and, contrary to what I thought, is not an indication of a grave emotional or mental disorder.  It occurs most often when the child goes to bed overtired, overstimulated, or is perhaps learning a new skill (like how to read or write, for example).<br>  <br>  There is no need to wake your child up from sleepwalking.  You were right in calmly changing his pjs and guiding him back to bed.  To reduce bouts in the future, you can make sure you stick to a consistent bedtime routine, and that he is going to bed relaxed.  Staying up too late can overstimulate them into a sleepwalking episode; I've noticed this is almost sure to trigger it in my son.<br>  <br>  Take a few simple safety precautions:  install locks on your doors that he can't reach, maybe a gate at the top of the stairs to prevent falls, and whatever adjustments you feel you need to make according to how your home is laid out.<br>  <br>  And then stop worrying.  It's scary as hell to see your little one in a state like that, but it's really not a cause for alarm.  Good luck and I hope this helps!|`|pT7jrsAgaa	It's fairly common for kids to this once or twice.

It's the weirdest thing when he starts, sometimes I have no idea if he is awake or asleep.<br>  I agree with the locks. I would think about getting a gate for the kitchen too. I don't sleep much, but I have once slept through him opening the kitchen cupboard and breaking a glass (requiring 3 stitches, and his heel glued on).<br>  <br>  About the best thing you can do, is grab his hand gently and take him to his bed. I found that Tobias was more prone to going towards Andrew & I (without knowing we were there) or light. Of cause I sit with my lamp on of a night.<br>  <br>  It is very common for Children, particularly boys. And they say that they do grow out of it. Just for now, you'll need to keep the house safe, and get new locks.<br>  Oh and pick up the toys off the floor. It makes for nasty accidents.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	Not my kids (though my 5 y/o talks a lot in her sleep, very coherently too), but my husband's horrible! I think it's the stress of his job, he has such strange hours and it's very emotionally/physically draining, so his sleep is never very good.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I wake up and he's wandering around doing weird stuff. Once I found him with his shirt on inside out and trying to make a grilled cheese. I tried talking to him and he would respond with something totally irrelevant. Didn't remember a thing about it in the morning. I like to take pictures of him doing stupid things and laugh at him later.<br>  <br>  I'd say don't try to wake them up out of it - sometimes sleepwalkers get really disoriented and might even get violent if woken. Just clean him up if it happens again and send him back to bed. Sleepwalkers are often highly suggestible, just say, "[name], do you think it's time to go back to bed?" or simply "follow me."<br>  <br>  I'm sure it's pretty common in kids his age to do that occasionally, but if it becomes frequent, talk to your pediatrician.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	There's nothing you can do about it, it's just a phase.  Just make sure your doors are locked.  My mother found me outside one night trying to take clothes in from the line.  I think I was 14 at the time.  I never had memories of it either.  Talk to his teacher at school, if applicable, and see if anything has been bothering him.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Since it was the first time, it might not be anything, just a random occurrence.<br>  <br>  When I was a kid I would sleep walk when spending the night in a new setting.  When I was little it was staying at my grandma's our at friend's.  Even into my early teens, I'd sometimes get out of my bunk at summer camp (I woke up outside of the bunkhouse one time with no recollection of walking outside!  In college I talked in my sleep.<br>  <br>  Maybe its nothing.  Maybe something is bothering him?  Maybe he had to pee, but the whole wake up first thing didn't come together this time.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Tiger, that's how I was in college in the dorms!  My roomate would talk to me in my sleep, and I'd give nonsense answers, then remember none of it the next day!|`|K7H1zrCbaa	my brother used to sleep walk when he was a little boy.  One time he slept walked out of our hotel room and out on to the highway.  He was found by a person who happened to know us and was staying at the same place we were (lucky!) and she came and returned him.  He was dragging the hotel blanket behind him.  Eventually he grew out of it.  I surprised he never got hurt.|`|lXE75yQjaa	Nope, have not been through that. If it persists, might be good to consult with your pediatrician for some ideas. I would worry about safety more than anything when this happens.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I slept walked as a child, it really isn't a big deal. Just make sure you put a chain lock on the front door up high so he can't get out and guide him back to bed. There really isn't much you can do about it, don't bother trying to wake him up, it's either pointless or if you do manage to, he couldget violent. Tell his DR so he is aware of it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	My niece is a sleep walker. Her parents are afraid she will go outside. You could get a door alarm for his bedroom door so that you will know if he leaves his room in the middle of the night. <br>  <br>  I think the biggest concern with sleepwalking is safety. What if they go outside? What if they climb up on something and fall? etc. <br>  <br>  It might have just been a one time thing though. My six year old stepson slept walked once and tried to run a bath at 2 in the morning but he hasn't done anything like that since.
MeJplr38aa	People mix all kinds of alcohol with Red Bull like my alltime fave Jagerbombs..<br>  <br>  Just a little bit is not going to kill you unless you have a preexisting heart problem. Its just like drinking a Sparks (alcoholic energy drink)<br>  <br>  I would not though get hammered that way all the time. Give your heart a break. If you are wanting things to taste good. Take a break from the hard alcohol and have wine coolers so you dont have to chase with Red Bull and you can still get a little intoxicated. <br>  <br>  You put this in the adolescent section so I hope you arent underage and Im giving this information.|`|IV8UetWNaa	I actually mix the 2 as a drink.  A few of them and I know I'll be up for a while.  Too many and you'll probably crash pretty hard since there is a lot of sugar and caffeine in Red Bull.  I try to stick to the sugar-free.  It's not bad for you in small quantities.|`|cnyU6KXzaa	It makes you feel like you can drink more, because your tolerance seems like it is more than it is. It will not, however, directly kill you. Just drink responsibly.|`|bZZEIjmFaa	Well its not good for you, however it does taste very good. I would mix it personally and just sip on a drink or two. but do what you want just don't drink to much red bull, or vodka for that matter.|`|FH2iKFcJaa	mixing ANY energy drink with alcohol is harmful. <br>  Red bull speeds the heart rate while Alcohol thins the blood. The two work against each other. You can drink more faster without feeling it then boom youre REALLY drunk.|`|CiSQejBNaa	ive did it...it really didnt give me an affect...but its a bad chaser b/c redbull + vodka=****!! though i do recommend vodka and mountain dew|`|nBuvLq9Gaa	sounds like a mixture of disaster<br>  i won't drink it|`|dB6MR0wYaa	people do it all the time, it just gives you a bigger buzz|`|iD8z7KZBaa	You ask for trouble|`|8e5YBwd7aa	yessssssssss|`|Jucak0HLaa	I know people that do it and nothing has happened.But I wouldn't try it.|`|N3iaUGMaaa	You can die if you drink too much|`|m3ThrbDMaa	The reason that combo is bad is...<br>  <br>  Alcohol combined with large amounts of herbal stimulants physically deteriorates your liver and kidneys very quickly, which means regular combos of that mix has a darn good chance of messing up your internal organs, and that ain't good...there are people waiting for liver and kidney transplants...<br>  <br>  Don't become one of them...do not mix those two things...it's medically proven what I just said...you have been warned by a master of mixture...<br>  <br>  ((()))"GONG!"((()))|`|fR2Geezcaa	There are warnings out about mixing alcohol and Red Bull. They say since Red Bull  is so full of caffeine that people are not aware of their level of intoxication and can easily over drink. I personally stay away from it. If I am to tired to hit the bars and party then I get some rest and go the next night.|`|FpeEJbhaaa	It would certainly be bad tasting|`|gsW5jVbtaa	i heard someone died from that. there heart was beating too fast and they died.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	I drink this all the time. It is actually offered in bars and very popular. It is not harmful at all. The stimulants in the redbull are not significant enough to do harm mixed with the basically weak depressant nature of alcohol.<br>  <br>  It is true though that mixing a narcotic depressant and narcotic stimulant is very dangerous.|`|Jopw27gMaa	Yes as red bull bright your heart rate and up and vodka brings it down. This could lead to you passing out and then being sick and choking on it .. <br>  Do not mix these.|`|nQLtGEEgaa	Naw.. Aint anybody ever died from it.. I've drank it mixed and chased a shot, I promise nothin will happen.. U'll have a drunk, good ol' time tho!!|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	well there is a drink called a vodkabull, red bull and vodka, its really yummy, but so bad for you.|`|3OP1YIXCaa	it probably is dangerous.|`|bkx93l8Daa	yes. it is bad... i watched a special on TV about it|`|iwcp9rJzaa	umm. <br>  drinking is bad in general? duh.|`|qwvijKexaa	you will get yourself killed, if you mix them
DKqsFGymaa	The kids in my daycare love to play with Magic Putty.  It's similar to Play Dough, but it's shiny and "melts". <br>  <br>  Probably not something you can do today because of the ingredients, but the Borax can be purchased at the grocery store the next time you go.<br>  <br>  The recipe is on this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.daycareanswers.com/indoor-activities-for-kids.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.daycareanswers.com/indoor-act...</a>
RKTNDLDKaa	I wouldn't assume that the school is purposely trying to hold back your child.    I think that the teacher/school has difficulty in knowing how to properly communicate their concerns with your advanced child.     Or simply have limited experience in dealing with an advanced child.  <br>  <br>  Does your school system have a "gifted" program that he might qualify for?    Some do.     Ask the principal.   <br>  <br>  As far as providing book orders for the higher reading level.     I would say that the teachers feel like it might be an inconvenience to provide him with a book order form for the 6th grade since she'd have to get with a 6th grade teacher to get a book order form, get your order to that teacher and that teacher would have to get the ordered books back to you.        I really don't think the other students would know that he's getting a different order form--I think that's an excuse--and a poor one.  <br>  <br>  The other issue, which is valid, is that the subject matter for a 6th grade leverl may not be appropriate for him.      The subject matter for those levels teeter on the verge of PG-13 material, dealing with boyfriend/girlfriend issues; changes to your body; and some other social and emotional issues that your 2nd grader might not be ready for and you may not be willing to discuss at this point.  <br>  <br>  Again talk to the teacher about your concerns, the school counselor if your contact with the teacher is not favorable, or the principal.       You should also do what you feel is best for your child.    I don't think you're a troublemaker for wanting what is best for him.|`|fBGq6BL6aa	You should spank your child and tell him to stop being so smart, then you won't have anymore problems with the school.|`|MXnSWKCkaa	by books 4 him and have him take them 2 school 4 HIM not 4 the other kids if not maybe u could ask a kids parents 4rm 5th or 6th grade to ask 4 a extra flyer and to give it to u unless the school wont except it but  i dont understand y bcuz ur going to pay 4 the books u should ba able to choose what books you want|`|yWU57CLYaa	I would talk to the teacher in 5th grade and see if you can get a order form from him/her.  And if that still doesn't help, just talk to your boy and ask if he really needs to get books through the school.  I bet he would rather pick a book up at the library or store than get a book that is to easy for him.|`|3c8GsRvUaa	i always went to the scholastic warehouse to buy the books cause its open to the public.and they send coupons to you throw the mail and if anything order from the internet,|`|0vLU2GGGaa	just buy books yourself from bookstore or order from scholastic website.  For me, it is too much work to deal with the politic in school compare to just buy it myself.  You can find a lot of scholastic books "dirt cheap" in half price bookstore too.|`|zHRWklEWaa	Your going to have trouble reasoning with the school, but if you wish to visit the principal, guidance consoler, or librian directly. You could also talk with a 5th or sixth grade teacher and see if they have extras. If all else fails try to order from online or visit the bookstore. You could also see if his school offers enrichment or accelerated classes so that he doesn't become bored as he gets older.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Because the public school system isn't equipped to handle kids as individuals.  You are just going to have to supplement his reading with library books and think of another way to support the school fiscally.|`|EMKuBql8aa	I would go to the principle on this one because your child should be challenged, not bored and statistics say that if a child is bored in school, they don't do as well in middle/high school cause they see no point. Push this one.<br>  <br>  My wife and sister in law were the same way I guess, and their mom had to end up changing school so they could get a proper education. You might have to do something that extreme, education is very important. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	The school i work at allows the teacher to hand out Scholastic book orders on level, below level, above level.  I agree with you,   it only hurts the child to not allow him to read books that are on his level.  However, one fear that i know some schools have is the maturity level of books.  My nephew is in first grade and reads on a fifth grade level.  The issue is that fifth grade books many times are too mature in topic for a first grader.

If he's never had it, then he's certainly not missing it.  He should not have any form of candy or sweets for quite a while.  I didn't start giving my daughter lollipops and such until she was 3 and now she only gets it in small doses as a very special treat.  If you give a child candy too young, that's all they are going to want and then they won't eat the food that helps them grow.  This will make your mom pretty unhappy and could eventually harm your brother as well.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	"Depriving" him of candy. Honey if he has never had it,he doesn't miss it. I honestly think he's too young for it right now. His body is so tiny,even a small amount of sugar can be too much. Wait and let your mom decide when he should have candy.|`|jfEOIeSIaa	very small quantities of anything not his regular food. It may upset his stomach.|`|AA10478146	Not until he's at least 1 yr. old.  He could have a negative reaction to it at 9 months.  Don't worry, he has no idea what he's missing.

E5aMuyVhaa	Okay, well i kind of got busted in the creativity gene of my family... but i think i will try! Haha and yes i was the best answer to your "Do you think i am a $lut" question. <br>  So obviously you already read my story on my cousin who was pregnant at 14, so you know about how close i was to her.  My cousin really wanted me to be the godmother, but I couldn't  because i had not done the sacrament of confirmation yet, so yeah :( <br>  The way my cousin told me she was pregnant was when she invited me over her house when she was home alone they night she found out, and just cried and cried and cried and we ate icecream and talked for the rest of the night.  Apparently that does not sound like that could work in your situation lol. :)<br>  Oh and why are people being so rude to you! Thats terrible! You are right... its better to enjoy it than mope about it! IGNORE those witches who are being rude. Its disgraceful.. especially when they say you shouldn't be happy... thats RIDICULOUS! I was THRILLED for my cousin, and i hope yours is too. congrats.<br>  <br>  Well here are a few nifty ideas...<br>  <br>  Tell her you want to play 20 questions. Ask her regular boring questions like you would on any normal night... then when you get to about the halfway mark, ask her, "Someday will you be the Godmother to my son or daughter?" (She will most likely say yes) then on the next question say "What about becoming one in 9 months?" and start smiling and tell her your pregnant. <br>  <br>  Heres another idea...<br>   <br>  Well this is partial cheating because i saw this on full house... haha yes.. i know i know a really cheesy show. Heres a clip for an idea...<br>  (The part where she does the pictionary part... thats clever)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1TUlZ4WiNI&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1TUlZ4Wi...</a><br>  <br>  Heres another<br>  <br>  Say you want a picture of her to put in a scrap book, on myspace, in your room etc....<br>  <br>  So take 3 pictures, and keep telling her that you could take better and that you want a redo, and randomly right when you are about to say "CHEESE!" say "I'm Pregnant and you are the Godmom!" and snap the picture RIGHT after to get her reaction.. thats should be priceless!<br>  <br>  And ONE more... :)<br>  <br>  Ask your mom if you can go out and make a secretive them dinner around your pregnancy. Like get baby back ribs, baby carrots, baby pickles, lol Anything! that has to do with babies. That should be cool. Then tell her she will be the God mother. <br>  <br>  Congrats and thanks! Feel free to e-mail me anytime for advice or just someone to vent or talk to!|`|AlnItc6Gaa	You could buy a little onesie (gender neutral) that says "I love my godmother". =)|`|JduQHocdaa	Buy a baby onsie,a gift box,and some wrapping paper.

Tell her to run as fast as she can away from you and that you are a horrible role model and irresponsible and to never ever ever follow in your footsteps.<br>  <br>  And then tell your Mother and your Aunt they need a reality check!!|`|sU60NqWWaa	Wow, 14 years old and pregnant.  Good luck.<br>  I'm sure you could just tell Devlin right up front.<br>  I'm still having a problem with your family being happy about a 14 yr. old being pregnant.|`|iwcp9rJzaa	OMG! how super exciting!|`|LdzTP5VXaa	You are a baby having a baby... Just make sure you tell her not to make the same mistake.|`|YdFZH56taa	omg congrats first of all. second just tell her|`|23c99fcd4aa2aac54a97abdb713c5f5eaa	Okay first of all the people leaving the nasty comments do need to remember that this girl is still a child! <br>  <br>  Honey I realize that your happy about this baby but I don't think you really comprehend what it takes to raise a baby. It's hard as an adult and it's gonna be even harder as a child. I hope you have alot of support and help because you are gonna need it! Please get on birth control after this baby is born so this doesn't happen again. As for telling your cousin your pregnant, I would say just tell her. Also the comments people are making may hurt you but you will probably be telling your cousin yourself after this baby is born that being a mother at 14 is not all that it's cracked up to be. That doesn't mean that you love your child any less, it just means that reality will hopefully sink in!|`|Angk8Cxpaa	your taking this very maturely thats wonderful. I would tell her in private. <br>  <br>  But a creative way is to write a note say There is a big surprise turn the card around to find out. Then have a picture of your ultrasound and write your going to be the godmother. <br>  <br>  Or have a meal planned . And only it things that are tiny or baby stuff and just keep giving her cules till she guesses. So for food ideas: baby corn, soft things, cut your food really really small, your drink in a kid cup.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA11988490	Wait you are 14 & you are pregnant?<br>  Ugh.|`|8e5YBwd7aa	Oh god,Just tell her you need to talk to her in private and spill the news!|`|q52Z4v6Maa	i'm sorry...i suck in the creativity department lol...i would seriously just tell her...but that's me and my uncreative self lol...as for your additioal details...i'm totally with you and i agree to everything you said...the baby shouldn't be looked at as a mistake...your totally right and i'm soo happy that you are looking to the bright side of this situation and making the best of it...and not being like oher pregnant teens on here who just ran to an abortion clinic or are crying over the fact that their pregnant, they seriously should jus accept it..sorry that i dont have the answer to your question, but i just wanted to say that i agree with everything you said|`|wpHWiXnfaa	im very happy and excited for you. <br>  whatever people say, they are just<br>  jealous that you can get pregnant,<br>  and they can't. (:<br>  i think a fun way would to be like, taking pictures with Devlin, <br>  and on the first one be like, say cheese. and then look at it, and<br>  be like "i dont like that one so much, lets try again", and on the second picture be like, "im pregnant!". and then take the pic, and the look on her face will be priceless. haha. and then just tell her that she will be the godmother. good luck to you and the baby! if you need to talk, send me a message for my email. (:<br>  <br>  whats with the thumbs down? are you another jealous person?
ev0SHwMyaa	I used fertilaid to help regulate my very irregular cycle. The first month it regulated me perfectly and within 6 weeks of taking it I got my positive. I can't say for sure that it was the fertilaid but it seemed to have worked for me. <br>  I also only paid $29 a bottle. There is 100 caps per bottle and you take 3 a day, so it's a month's worth. They recommend buying 3 bottles but I only bought 2 and I never got to take the second bottle anyway.<br>  I think it's worth a try. If I thought it was too expensive I never would've never bought it but I probably wouldn't have got me positive either.<br>  I've also heard that you can buy Vitex in the drug store which is the main ingredient in fertilaid.<br>  Much baby dust to you*******Best of luck!!!|`|FASzVGrraa	idk i havent tried this yet but im thinking about it! hopefully you get some good answers im curious too! good luck!|`|vigFmfLmaa	Cons - it smelled really bad, cost a lot<br>  <br>  Pros - it was a multivitamin so at least I was getting some supplements there<br>  <br>  I think these things are just another way for desperate moms-to-be to lose more money.  Just buy prenatals, eat well and take care of yourself.  You can get all the vitamins and supplements in fertilaid at your local drugstore or gnc, and won't have to pay 75 bucks a bottle for them.
f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	My son did this once when he was 7 and he was put in timeout for recess.    There was no charge of sexual harassment and he would have never understood what was going on if there was.   When I found out I told him that it's really bad to hit on certain body parts that are considered private and people may get really mad about that.    Do you know how he responded?   "If it is really bad to hit there then howcome parents spank kids?"    I was at a loss for words. <br>  <br>    He is 15, almost 16 now and he doesn't remember the incident.   He does know that at age 7, "hitting on" girls was the furthest thing from his mind and he definitely didn't understand the implications of hitting a girl's butt.   But I already knew that.   He interacts a lot with girls nowadays and knows how to show them respect.   He prefers the "innocent" girls who have goals in life, not the "easy" types.   He indeed has morals.<br>  <br>  And yes, NOW is often considered irrational because they are sometimes extreme in many issues involving girls and women.   For example, when women commit violent crimes and get off easier then men who commited the same act, these feminists always have a way of minimizing and explaining away bad behavior ONLY when women are perpetrators .   They have always been "over the top".  <br>  <br>  ETA:<br>  <br>  Sweetgrass:<br>  <br>  How do you figure that he was a "punk kid with a messed up male figure in his life"?   What if your daughter smacks a kid's butt?, would it be OK if the other kid makes sure your child is "walking funny for years"?  These kids are still learning social norms and how some behaviors  are more wrong than other behaviors.   The kid is 7, not 13.    Sexual harassment is about intent to offend another in a sexual manner and these younger kids don't even understand that mindset.<br>  <br>  ETA:<br>  <br>  According to this link, children as young as 3 are being labeled as sexual harassers<br>   <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/AsSeenOnGMA/story?id=4585388" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/AsSeenOnGMA/st...</a><br>  <br>  Another link of 4 and 5 year olds in trouble for sexual harassment<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/127099/children_and_sexual_harassment_a_content.html?cat=49" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|3c8GsRvUaa	cause children need to know the rules its wrong cause if you where on the other side you would be mad.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	tell your nephew to keep his sleazy hands off other people bodies. My sons know better and my daughters would kick him in the slats. You dont touch other peoples behinds. YOU have the problem. Its wrong !|`|K7H1zrCbaa	susspending a 7 yr old for hitting a girls but is crazy.  a 7 yr old doesnt mean anything sexual by it.  now if he was a 17 year old it would be different.  BUT a SEVEN year old.  thats nuts.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	NOW didn't support Paula Corbin Jones or the other women President Clinton harassed.  So, yes, they are irrational.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Yes, seems ridiculous, that's the way the public schools are heading.|`|TrrVqO0haa	i do agree it is strange to see that as sexual harassment  but because of today the world see's itself as modern etc that everyone doesnt accept these things what happen and at that age the wont have much idea what it means anyway so he wouldnt of known very well what he has done
FplTPoAyaa	Everything happens for a reason. If you aren't ready to be a parent, consider adoption.  But...considering you are married, would you really and truly want to have an abortion ? That baby is a part of you and your husband.  Think about it.  Maybe 9 months down the road, you will be ready.  Give the baby a chance to live.  God bless and good luck.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	If this helps, I've known several couples in my lifetime who aborted a fetus early in their lives, and then went on to have wonderful kids later when they were ready.  My own brother (for example) didn't have his two kids until he was 38 years old, and I seem to recall him having that situation you describe with someone when he was in his early 20's, so...<br>  <br>  His kids are great and well taken care of with love and financial stability because he wisely waited until marriage and then financial stability...so...you can't get anymore responsible than that...and...within the 1st three months of pregnancy, the part of the human brain that is the seat of our awareness and personality has not even formed yet in the fetus...<br>  <br>  Right or wrong, you have to think about you and the father and your futures and weigh the cost of inadequately taking care of a child your not ready to take care of...it's a tough decision...but whatever you decide, I'm Pro-Choice...I think ultimately the Mother gets to make the call...<br>  <br>  Right or Wrong...|`|yotUSWcIaa	Don't be persuaded by the first answerer. Technically speaking, at this stage it is not a baby, merely a cluster of cells developing. You're asking for advise, yes, but not opinions on abortion. That part is up to you and your husband, just bear in mind both for and against arguments. You should definately consider being ready, as you said neither of you are, in your talk and weighing up.<br>  Make sure you both know what will happen in each circumstance or possibility. You need a big talk.<br>  Let this be a lesson to use protection, even in a marriage. lol<br>  <br>  As for the army bit, I'm afraid I can't help you there. Contact them, even if its anonimously, and enquire about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision, I hope it's the right one for you and your husband.|`|2JIkzC1baa	that I don't know if army soilders can get abortions. but I do that you are happy that u r pregnant but if the pregnancy gets in the way then u  have to figure out. i also will say that giving up a baby is a hard thing to do  a human being getting killed thats how you have to put it. but it can be worth before you have the baby before uget 2 know the child thats a BIG DECISION|`|8oAlBL91aa	This is not just his decision, don't abort your baby, looks like he'll just have to get used to it. You both took those vows and he needs to stand by them for better or worse so wither it's worse it will get better and he needs to stand behind them.|`|GgMMvHI8aa	You need to make some pretty big decisions with your husband. Talk about every option. And find out how it will effect your career should you keep the baby.  <br>   <br>  No one can do this for you. Be strong. Talk it out.|`|tO7lBnMfaa	Adoption should be a big consideration for you if you don't want this baby. However if you feel that abortion is your only option you are going to need discuss this with the army's medical division not us. I hope that you will do what is right for you and your family.|`|7nev9Jxiaa	dont kill a baby....<br>  there living things...<br>  how would you live the fact the your killed your baby??<br>  he/she could be the next president or something......<br>  dont end someones life before it even starts....<br>  give it up for adoption.... <br>  if you dont want it, im sure theres a couple out there somewhere <br>  who would love to have a baby......<br>  wish you the best of luck :]

Go to a mall and Just do some shopping for your child, or window shop and the walking will make your child come sooner.|`|ZXTOCzw2aa	well...its been said that the semen softens your cervix so therefore helping you move ahead. but i havent had any luck with it. i am due today and have been having sex but still the same for the past 3 weeks.|`|Ntj4p0Gqaa	yes maam|`|ihL0FkJYaa	yes it can|`|n4d7rqr4aa	I don't think there's any conclusive research that's been done, but many mums swear by it!|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Yes...well more so orgasms on your part can induce labour.
Ns9FrTGSaa	Hi<br>  <br>  are you sure he is not teething cause thats what happened with ny little girl.<br>  <br>  also i tried the hip organic baby rice and she was better with that one.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|DDIBEvUTaa	it's likely a growth spurt.  breastmilk or formula have more nutrients to help him grow.  You may just need to hang in there for a couple weeks & feed/nurse him at night.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	My son did this a few weeks ago when he turned 4 months too!<br>  <br>  I was a bit stuck on what it was.  He had a cold, he's teething, or it could've been a growth spurt.  He would take a bottle at night, but could go back to sleep without it.  He got over it in a week and he's back to his "normal" sleeping pattern.  It might just be a blip :)|`|Yl93lP1laa	It's not food he wants, it's YOU.  Usually around this time that babies start to realize that if they cry mommy comes running.  When he starts crying and it doesn't seem there is an immediate need (like a dirty diaper) then just pat his tummy and say "night-night" and leave.  Don't talk or smile or pick him up.  He probably won't take it well at first but give about a week and he'll realize that night time is not play time and will go back to his regular sleep habits.|`|EmYNUZcXaa	he's probably going through a growth spurt. nothing you can do about that. he'll be more hungry through it and it will probably last about 2 weeks. so when he's up and crying...feed him.|`|B1JFBV3jaa	He is probably teething.  Have you tried giving him tablets for that?<br>  <br>  By the way, what is dream feeding?|`|UXhFcHCHaa	its probably a growth spurt. if he cant tollerate the rice or oatmeal try the barley. i heard its easier on their bellys.

bTlhBX3daa	We can't help unless we know what kind of test it was. If you know what brand it was (Clear Blue Easy Digital, First Response, etc), you can look it up online and usually find out how to read the test. But just in general:<br>  <br>  If it's a +/- test, and it shows a + sign, or a strong vertical line and light horizontal line, that should mean pregnant. If it shows a vertical line or -, that would mean not pregnant.<br>  <br>  If it's a line test, 2 lines generally means pregnant and one line means not pregnant.|`|cjqOUq5xaa	Ok well it depends on what kind of test you took? The most common ones are if there are 2 lines you are Pregnant-(even if one is light) 1 line means your not or you didn't take the test correctly or waited to long to took at it and it is an evaporation line. Or the new digital ones either say pregnant or not pregnant. But if you had a different kind of test-Iam not sure either but if you go to the web-site it should show you the different results! Good luck and I hope I helped some!|`|7AtxrHQnaa	You should always keep the directions.  But usually a plus sign or 2 lines.  Check the manufacturers website.  If no luck there, buy another one.  I always recommend the Walgreen's brand Early Response.  They were the only ones that ever worked for, even when I was 2 or more weeks LATE!  Remember to take it in the morning, theres more HCG in your urine.  Good luck!|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	Normally 2 lines are positive - 1 line is negative, or a plus is pregnant a minus is negative. And if there is only a line in the control area of the test its invalid.<br>  <br>  What does your test have?|`|Ntj4p0Gqaa	two lines is pregnant... even if the second line is faint! one line... not pregnant, or just not enough time to tell yet.

Good luck in the future, and wish my luck too!<br>  <br>  FYI -- I only buy the cheap-o tests at Wal-Mart, the Equate brand ones and they've always worked fine for me.

Thanks for the warning.|`|GWveqx61aa	i had that same thing happen to me, very devestating, even though you were not pregnant it still hurts alot, one of the tests pamplets said that a false positive could be due to cysts, and another test i took had a perfect line but i seen no color, i took that as a positive, but later on found out it was an evaporation line, it completely disappeared after the test dried, now i have 5 more days before i can test again. keep your head up, im not going to say that it gets aeasier, it dont, i have been trying for 8 years. hopefully it happens for us soon, good luck and baby dust to you|`|AA11764194	Thanks for let me know.. wl not buy it next time..

The first 3 I went into labor on my own. With my 4th, I was 38 years old with Gestational Diabetes and showed no signs of impending labor at 41 weeks. I had no effacement or dilation so my team of doctors suggested an insertion of prostoglandin gel to see if it would at least get my cervix thinking about softening and thinning. I had a bad reaction to the gel and began to have 6 minute contractions which sent my baby into distress with alarmingly low heart rates that dipped into the 40's (not 140, but 40). I had the gel inserted at noon and my baby was born after some intense labor at 7:29 PM. I went from no signs of labor to having my baby in about 7 1/2 hours. If I had any more babies, I would have chosen to skip any induction methods, but we called it quits after #4 and my husband got a vasectomy. She was a surprise baby conceived when I was reliably taking birth control pills for 11 years and our older kids were 18, 15, and 12.|`|N48qV69daa	My mom went three weeks past her due date with me.

kjgonYlgaa	Get down and play with them at their level.  Intervene quickly and distract them with something fun they both enjoy.  They'll quickly figure out that it's more fun to play and have fun than to sit a time out.|`|3sCYoFW1aa	You have to remember that their world is still all about them.

CjafsNslaa	It is way too early to tell if you could be pregnant. The peeing and eating could just be you being paranoid from reading about it. Just dont think about it and in 3 weeks take a test. Stop reading stuff and just wait. Your just going to make yourself sick over it. Good luck.|`|2DM7MaXyaa	you wont eat or pee more til your like 6 months... and its wayyyy to early to have signs! you wont know for another 3 wks thats why you can test. i dont think you are.. once sperm hits air it dies... good luck.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	You HAVE to wait, there is no other way to tell this early.

You should definitely let your baby live (no abortion).  However, you have to figure out the reason you got pregnant.  Was it because you're ready for a baby and can take care of one?

JRXpYW3Naa	They usually do a urine test, but some do a blood test. I've had both done at different hospitals.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Usually they test the same way YOU test -- you pee in a cup and they dip a test strip into it.  <br>  <br>  If the test is inconclusive, they would do a blood pregnancy test -- draw blood from your arm and send it a lab, which tests it for pregnancy hormones.  <br>  <br>  If even THAT is inconclusive, an ultrasound would pick up a heartbeat  in the uterus a few weeks after your missed period.  There are also other possible physical signs -- (i.e. changes in color of your cervix and vagina) but they are less accurate than blood/urine tests.|`|iwYu32N2aa	They would do a blood test or a urine test.

Ccq8zEcnaa	It is normal for your symptoms to go away in your second trimester. This is a good thing! If you are worried about not showing, it will come in time. I didn't get a bump until around 20 weeks, which is further than what you are. if you are worried about the viability of your baby, call your doctor and maybe he/she can order you an ultrasound to put you at ease.|`|67QVKHQ3aa	it depends on how big or small you were before pregnancy..<br>  <br>  its different for everyone, i was considered average weight but i lost 15 lbs in the beggining of my pregnancy and now ive gained that back plus 15 more...<br>  <br>  also i just really started showing and im 6 months, so dont rush it, i promise one morning you will wake up and not even be able to se you Cho Cha anymore...<br>  <br>  as far as the symptoms, you will be experiencing something different all the time, for me cramping was a big thing so consider that a symptom for now until your new one comes along...(kicking, moving, big nipples....)|`|n4d7rqr4aa	For most people, things like morning sickness are gone by the second trimester.

f2ca550ba141680eff4abf0b4511313caa	Hi, there is a good chance of them being mature, babies are technically considered full term as of 37 weeks so your just 4 days shy of that mark, there is a very small chance that the membranes will rupture but then again its a chance, your almost done hang in there, i know that the last couple of weeks seems to be the longest after waiting so long to meet your little one for the first time, try not to worry too much and use this time to get some rest in between your nesting,  it wont be long now until your little bundle of joy will be resting in your arms, its the most wonderful feeling in the world, congratulations and easy labor dust sent to you, I wish you all the best.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	most likely baby will be fine- my son was born  at 36 weeks and came home with me the next day|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I think your baby will be fine at 36weeks. Babies have been born a lot sooner than that and survived. She might have to spend some time in the NICU for a while though which is better than her not coming home at all.<br>  I can't give you a 100% on my certainty as it could go either way but technology is great now days and I think you're daughter will be fine.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	They are very good that they will be mature. Here in the states, 37 weeks is considered full term so you are just a few days away from being full term. My son was born at 34w4d and his lungs were mature and didnt even go into the NICU. He was small (4lbs 4.5oz) but he was healthy! I dont know about the whole membranes rupturing after the amnio. I just randomly went into labor with my son early so anything is possible though!|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I had a an amniocentesis on my 23rd week and It doesnt not cause the bag to rupture. And yes your baby has a very high chance of having fully matured lungs.

hnICmxMoaa	very rare but some women can ovulate during their periods...though most of the times the ovule is not viable..there are changes that can happen<br>  that's why some women get pregnant while doing it without a condom during period|`|OKarH9Zsaa	No, you do not ovulate while on your period.|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	no you do not ovulate during your period, the discharge you experience is probably clotting substance.|`|K3as3nwzaa	i have that same type of **** goin on with me during my period. ive been searchin all over the web for answers. the type of clear, stretchy like mucus seems to be the peak point of ovulation off a period so if you have the same type of discharge during your period i supose you can ovulate during your period as well. every woman is different. i guess we are 2 out of 1,000,000,000,000,000 lol.|`|0rLeIEp5aa	Actually yes you can ovulate while you are on your period. Some women actually get pregnant even though the only time they have unprotected sex is during their period. The mucosy, stretchy discharge is normal.|`|8e5YBwd7aa	No you cant ovulate when youre on your period .
DWwv3v9Raa	You first need a lot of love to give.<br>  <br>   diapers, bibs , onesies, gowns for easy diaper changes (especially at nite), bottles, pacifiers, bed, bedding, hats blankets, stroller, some sort of bouncer they can be sat in during the day.<br>  <br>  BTW, congrats :-)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well, there are a lot of things that are not necessary, but make life a lot easier, i say look at the register list on babies r us as well....some are good, some are just to get extra money; you just have to sift through them...<br>  <br>  the absolute basics a nb needs at home is...<br>  <br>  food; bm or formula...if formula, bottles, bottle brush, drying rack<br>  <br>  shelter<br>  <br>  love and attention, cuddling, being close to you<br>  <br>  diapers, whether cloth or disposables, they will use an enormous amt when they first come home<br>  <br>  wipes or washclothes<br>  <br>  highly suggest some regular desitin, generic tylenol and mylicon<br>  <br>  thermometer, little kit that has clippers, emery boards, brush, etc...<br>  <br>  clothing, depending on your climate, and how many layers you need....only really need onesies (long or short sleeve dep on your climate), some sleepers with the feet in; thin if it is warm, thicker for cold<br>  i highly recommend a couple of 'swaddle me's by kiddopotamus, you can get them at babies r us for ten bucks a piece and they are excellent, i think those are why my dd has always slept through the night...we only used two, used them every night, and they still look like new; they are great for when your arms are worn out and you need to lay baby down, or at night<br>  <br>  highly recommend a boppy with a couple of the cotton covers...the fancy soft ones dont fit as well, but this will save your back and arms whether you bfeed or ffeed...used later to help sit up, tummy time, etc...<br>  <br>  car seat...try your best to buy new...stroller is nice but you can get by without it if you have too...<br>  <br>  lingerie bag is great for washing little socks and hand mitts without losing them in the wash....<br>  <br>  baby wash, frag and dye free laundry detergent<br>  <br>  thin and thicker blankets<br>  <br>  my dd would only take a 'soothie' brand passy, they are supp to reduce sids if baby sleeps with it; your own choice if u want to use one, but i would rather try to take away her passy than her thumb;)<br>  <br>  towels for bath, you can use your own towels, baby towels are nice, but you can get by without them....<br>  <br>  nice to have: mosquito or weather mesh cover for infant carrier..easy to take off, can see through it, but keeps strangers from touching your nb...and they WILL; i ihave no idea why.....<br>  <br>  a little later on, after you baby doenst want to be swaddled anymore, the sleepsacks are great, we have some thin cotton ones for hot weather, thicker ones for cool weather and thicker ones with sleeves for when it's cold...then there are no loose blankets and you can put as many layers or lack of you need before you put them in the sack; my dd is 8 mos old and still has never slept with a loose blanket, although i feel sure she could pull anything off her head, i don't want to take any chances...<br>  <br>  a little expensive, but myself and my dd love the baby bjorn, i have the one with back support bc i have probs, but she loves it and she will still sleep in it when she's tired.....they are great; slings just seemed too flimsy to me; jmho..hth<br>  if u want a list of things that i use and love, email me.....|`|B9KwqnuDaa	It all depends on what you want to do. <br>  Personally all I ever really needed for my babies is clothes, diapers, wipes, nursing blankets, a carseat, a wrap/sling, a few bottles incase I wanted to hand express milk, a couple picifiers, and a couple good books on children.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	The only things you really *need* are<br>  <br>  a safe shelter (your home)<br>  a way to feed your baby (breasts are easily available and free)<br>  a way to keep your baby clean (diapers, some gentle soap, and water)<br>  a place for your baby to sleep (newborns will easily sleep in arms and babies of any age can easily sleep near mom).<br>  <br>  So, think about those basics and then add in anything you feel like you will need.  <br>  <br>  If your baby will travel by car, you'll need a car seat, but not everyone does.<br>  <br>  If you want to be a hands off parent (feed the baby, change the baby, then leave baby alone until next scheduled feeding), you'll need a safe place to put your baby (swing, bassinette, crib, moses basket).   If you're going to be a hands on parent, you don't have such a strong need for these items, but they do come in handy.  Really, though, you don't need a bouncy chair, swing, basinette, crib, and moses basket.  Pick a couple and you'll be fine.  Slings and wraps are also wonderful for hands on parents.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to co-sleep, you'll need somewhere for your baby to sleep.  Bassinets/the bassinet insert for a pack-n-play, cribs, and moses baskets all work for newborns and small babies.  Swings also work for naps.<br>  <br>  If you don't plan on breast feeding, you'll need bottles and formula, but won't really need sterilizing equipment or bottle warmers.  If you breastfeed, you could benefit from some breast pads and possibly a pump if you plan on leaving your baby often.<br>  <br>  Hygiene items are also needed:  diapers (cloth or disposable), wipes (cloth or disposable), soap (baby wash or gentle soap), lotion (baby or gentle lotion), rash cream (even if you don't use it), and a way to trim baby's fingernails.<br>  <br>  Yes, you need clothes/blankets etc for your baby, but you already know that.  :)|`|Yl93lP1laa	You're right, you don't need much.  The basics, of course, are warm clothing, diapers and a crib. A bouncy seat is helpful and soothing for a place to put baby while you cook or do other thing around the house. <br>  <br>  Everything else is just for convenience.  It's up to each family to decide what they will need to make their life with baby easier. Babies r us has a registry suggestion list online you can look over and much of that is helpful but  not all of it is necessary.|`|4ksa4lhWaa	Milk, diapers, wipes, gas drops, baby Tylenol, onies, blanket, rash cream, hat (summer time), Pack N Play, bottles<br>  <br>  If you want a, swing it helps when you need to put the baby down for a bit.|`|Z6CJApzJaa	I would suggest the obvious like diapers, wipes, and bottles. If you are planning on breast feeding and don't want to by a pump check with the hospital and see if you can rent a pump or go to the wic department, they often have loaner pumps. Don't worry they are sterilized. Next make sure you have clothing to keep the baby warm or cool. Somewhere for the baby to sleep. I used a bassinet for my baby until she was about 2 1/2 months old then bought a crib. Wish you the best!|`|fBGq6BL6aa	A couple boobs full of milk, diapers, clothes, and a bed.

He's able to wash himself though, he uses kiddie soap.<br>  <br>  My 5 month old has a bath every other day, and i use baby soap for him.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	my girl is almost 6.  I give her bath everyday (since day 1), and wash her hair every other day.  Of course i use soap on their genital, why not??  I wash with soap myself too.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	13 months<br>  girl<br>  4-5 times a week (dry skin)<br>  yes, baby wash because it's gentle|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	My son is 2 and i give him a bath every night and wash his hair [he has greasy hair like his father] and i use soap on his private parts.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	5 1/2<br>  <br>  Girl<br>  <br>  She showers every night. She can do everything herself, though sometimes I have to help with shampoo, if it gets in her eyes she gets really upset.|`|AA11537580	5<br>  <br>  girl<br>  <br>  2-3 times a week because she has eczema and it's aloud to bath often<br>  <br>  yes|`|JFbWyKKDaa	My child is a 7 month old boy, and I bathe him 2-3 times a week or if he poops through his diaper. I use soap on his genitals, but you should be careful not to use too much soap with girls because it will give them an infection ( I had it when I put too much bubble bath solution in my bath a a little girl) and it irritates their genitals.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	When my boys were 6 of course I'd bath and wash their hair ever day, everywhere with soap!  Now they are 10 and 12, I just sniff their hair to make sure they actually used shampoo and not just wet it! As for using soap on their genitals?  I'm just gonna have to trust them, cause momma ain't sniffing there!! :)|`|iXxMgMCmaa	Hi I have a 5 year old daughter. She takes showers everyother day at least and takes a bubble bath at least once a week. I shampoo her hair for her and let her just a sponge with soap to wash the rest of her body herself.|`|5rdiZvYEaa	5.5 and 2<br>  <br>  Boys<br>  <br>  Every night before they go to sleep. My 6 year old is finally getting to that stage where he wants to bathe himself,though.<br>  <br>  Yes, of course i do.|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	I bathed my older kids up until they could do a decent job themselves...6 or so...I use ivory soap or kids baby wash..that should be safe enough for genitals (girls' being more prone to irritation, I guess)|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	my son is 1 i bathe him 6 days a weeks wash his hair every other day i use soap onhis genitals but not putting it directly on them|`|PYIA2FCFaa	my son is 5 years old.

Lqbww4QSaa	Try and resolve the situation, but do it camly try and persuade your parents that i'm very stressed about my life, latley, im sure they'll understand. i gaurntee you the'yll stop fighting. Try and go to your school and get couciling and if gets way to serious tell a family member e.g. Uncle or Aunt or Call 911 if it gets out of hand.<br>  <br>  Dont give up on you Parents because you probly love your dad alot and your mom so try and keep a bond with the family<br>  <br>  Hope it helps|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	i agree with the others, next time they start, call 911, go off to another room and call,they will come and document it, and likely take at least your dad to jail for the night, then your mom can get a restraining order and file for a divorce without him having to agree with it.|`|AA10475412	Get some counseling, and help ASAP!|`|5rdiZvYEaa	You can't persuade your father to get a divorce. I'd say you and your sister go to a friends house and just relax. I'd also talk to someone about it.|`|LdzTP5VXaa	Next time that their argument gets rough call 911 and hung up they'll come to your place.|`|Qiwkbevsaa	call 911 an u need to get some help seriously

krQiDGCHaa	No.  It is, however, your most fertile time and your best chance at getting pregnant.<br>  <br>  I've heard of people getting pregnant while ON their period, so if you're trying to avoid pregnancy, don't just skip sex around 14 days after your period.<br>  <br>  Also, some women don't even ovulate then.  Personally,  I ovulate about 9-11 days after my last period, I have a short cycle.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: You can get pregnant ANY TIME, however when you ovulate is just your best chance of getting pregnant.|`|vigFmfLmaa	No.  You can get pregnant anytime sperm come in contact with an ovum.  That occurs at different times for different women.|`|FASzVGrraa	those are your most fertile times but everyone is different so anything is possible!|`|AA11764194	Depends on your cycle and your ovulation.. usually most ladies ovulate during that time.. so there is high chance of getting pregnant during that time

AA11189953	If you want to do it, it won't hurt anything but the thing here is that once you do it  you must keep doing it or be prepared to go through a day or so of the most evil and wicked itch this side of a yeast infection.|`|AA10378559	No. Besides the fact that it can lead to infection or, at least chafing in time, there are many cultures that see the naturalness of a woman's bodily hair as a part of her allure. Legs, armpits, etc. are not shaved at all. Daily bathing and strongly scented preparations are used to heighten the allure. American women seem ashamed of their natural endowment today. Shaving does not add to anything you do.|`|674e7f3ed3b6898d44416be9abf15327aa	yes i do that sometimes and i am only 11 years old|`|4ddb2528520b7d7eef326c8171f21699aa	Its your own personal prefrence and what makes you comfortable dont let anyone make you feel as if you have to do this or have to do that, me personally I like shaving because it just feels cleaner but its what makes you happy|`|AA11767576	you should decide , afterall it is yours|`|AA12134988	Personal thing ain't it?

I do my boyfriend likes it plus i dont get as hot down there when i do have hair and when a guy eats you out it is better for them.|`|ae4b78a6c4b29ff27e9f0cfac2b63b81aa	yes they should shave it. its alot sexier believe me. most men love it|`|bd7265486b644d027cf6506ba6ee945aaa	I loved hairy pussy<br>  mail me please <br>  neeraj_maheshwari53@rediffmail.com
58a34b4cac1df3bf785ff35ce44b9b5caa	Yes everything that you experience it is very possible for your husband or significant other to experience the same things you are going through. Almost as if they were pregnant themselves. Your husband/other can gain the weight, have the back ache, feel nausea, etc. This is a good thing to some extent b/c it shows that you and your other are very close and that he wants to enjoy and experience this wonderful occasion with you to its fullest. kenziebuchanan@hotmail.com if you have anymore questions|`|AA12002954	LOl same thing happend to me with my daughter...I believe cause they R THE FATHER...how sweet!|`|74455667f124980a51403ffa72db4cd8aa	Actually it is normal and I was watching some medical show and it is a medical condition.  So enjoy it, since he will be well rested he can get up at night.|`|1cc1e92becbf18d22262b7d8cdc4d41faa	its because he is so atatched to you my husband does the same thing he has all my cravings and if he lays next to me he gets all my sickness i kinda love feeling normal...thats when you know your husband really loves you...hes is with you souly and fisically...with my first child he was in labor behind me in a wheel chair...lol...|`|AA10111836	Strange as it may sound, some men start to feel pregnant while their partner's expecting -- they even exhibit similar symptoms. The phenomenon is called Couvade Syndrome or "sympathetic pregnancy."|`|AA12364241	its a psycological effect on the body...the father feels the pain out of "sympathy" because he's around the wife so much...same thing with women and their cycles...when they are around eachother a lot, they tend to get their periods around the same time...cool, huh
8edae820f146855793d428b2d7be2803aa	this one is always fun, "does my penis taste like chocolate or does it taste like vanilla".  it typically takes about 10 minutes to find the answer.<br>  <br>  another fun one is "guess that pitcher's ERA". this game is played with you in the doggie position and the male standing behind you, with the sports section resting on your back.|`|AA12062130	SLOWLY TOUCH THE TIP OF THE NIPPLE AND TURN AND SQUEEZE IT JENTLY  USE FINGER TO PUT IN YOUR VEGINA TO DO REST OF I  WILL COME GIVE ME YOUR PHONE NUMBER AND ADDRESS|`|0a4db38b0bea6ee5daecee6c31ace8ffaa	sorry i don't know any.|`|4a8510d1783bf04cca1d23a53b0f10d0aa	kicking and jumping|`|721b4dd5c58a23febe9a142fac6035dfaa	what a slut|`|a7feb6912346355643dce73bbd9842d0aa	Who can last the longest lol
75ef4bf984a1e12696ab2f94c123c1c9aa	This is WAY too serious for our layman opinions.  Even if someone replies who has been through something like this, no two cases are exactly the same.<br>  TALK TO A GOOD DOCTOR before you decide.|`|39b002b373da90dfe7fc4091845e1711aa	the best advice i can give you is this: you and your fiance should go to the doctor together and ask all questions that are one your mind (make a list of questions before hand it may make it easier) and decided along with the doctor what is best for you and possibly a baby.|`|55d264b1902eeddfeae37decb51a4e21aa	im in the same situaton!!!idk what to do|`|619afdae615a0bdfb6af9fdc04903993aa	It is scary and frightening but one day while you're haveing your period talk to him about it before bed!
AA10817830	Vaginal discharge is normal regular occurance, and not a symptom of pregnancy. If you monitor yourself, you actually have vaginal discharge through out your cycle...and it changes as you are nearing ovulation.|`|b9f9b7b1c99dc44a1ab7b5eda29ea47caa	It can mean both|`|AA12122587	This symptom can mean both. I used to experience something of such when pregnant.|`|cfeaec8a78dd7501463c2358835cee3caa	it only means your getting your period
b107af5a2ad1d753fddc236413263b43aa	It sounds like you do not ovulate all the time. I too had a hard time conceiving my son (8 years) that is because i never had a normal period. Finally i have went to the doctor and the doctors have told me that i do not ovulate on a regular basis that is why i do not have may periods or why they are very very whacked out.  check with the doctor maybe you are not ovulating either. There is one way that u can get your self to ovulate on your own. Loose 5% of your body fat...even if you are skinny it has been studied that by loosing 5 % of your body fat can cause your body to start ovulating.  After 8 years of trying my hubby and i went on a diet, not to get pregnant because i didn't know about that until later, but just to loose weight, i lost 20 lbs started having periods again.... 3 in a row and the was pregnant so i believe in it. Also you can talk to your doctor and ask for metformin. It is a drug used to treat diabetes but again it will usually jump start you in to ovulation. This is safer than the fertility drugs as it will no make you have more than i child.  Best of Luck|`|ee2dc8923703d27b94d0d5ad9f9f42fbaa	HAVE SEX ON THE DAY YOU OVULATE   IT WORKED FOR ME|`|f18225650436bb14cc1f143858a62071aa	Most couples will concieve within the first year of activly trying.

fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	If you have been seeing your regular OB-GYN and he has prescribed Clomid for the last three months with no success, you need to make an appointment with a Fertility Specialist. If you have regular cycles and clomid is not helping you may have other factors contributing to your infertility. Has your husband had his sperm count done?<br>  <br>  There could be a number of things that are wrong and a number of things that your OB-GYN can't do for you. Make an appointment with a Specialist.|`|f23f987b67af4d5401ce9ed150107d21aa	I am interested in why you are on clomid in the first place - one common use is for when you have irregular cycles...was it determined by your doctor that you aren't ovulating or that you have a short luteal phase? Those should be the only reasons that you would be on Clomid if you have regular cycles.  You definitely need to consult a doctor on this & not strangers on an internet question board - this is what the doctors are trained for...|`|6b6b5e3a3afdf12aef82ddf38752e881aa	It is better to consult an expert Gynae.
d6ce865773a162ccbf0ec547aadf548caa	if you already ovulated and the egg is fertalized your temp. will remain high..so you MIGHT be pregnant. take a test|`|fe2052514b4fb1d1d309fae0a768578caa	TAKE ONE OF THOSE EARLY PREGNANCY TESTS, GOOD LUCK!!!|`|fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	Your temp remains high after you ovulate. I would wait until Monday. If you don't start your period, then take a HPT. Good Luck!!
AA10172626	Hey- I'm getting ready to start my first IVF cycle, but I've been on the injectables before for IUI.  There are a ton of different meds that you can be on and the side effects wll vary depending on which ones your doctor gives you and how you personally respond to them.<br>  <br>  That said, my personal experience was that the first part wasn't bad.  I didn't notice too much in the way of side effects.  After the HCG, I was extremely crampy and bloated feeling.  Tylenol and a heating pad were my best friends for a while.  I found the progesterone supplementation after the HCG to be the most unpleasant part.  I was moody and forgetful (I especially hated the forgetful).  But you deal with it because you have to.  And if it ends in a pregnancy, then it will have been worth every mood swing. :-)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8c9a18ab54458aacb5654333ef3fe545aa	Get your IVF-invitro fertilization treatment in India .IVF treatment, IUI, ICSI and Laparoscopic surgery is very cheap in India. There is one company that is very famous in India that arranges all types of medical treatment and surgery for foreigners in India. They are called the Forerunners Healthcare. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. I have also read that they arrange financing for American and Canadian patients, as some of the surgery including ivf treatment is not covered by insurance.<br>  <br>  They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. The cost savings are incredible. As a doctor I personally believe that your treatment and surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available here is simply best in the world. The doctors are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star. I recently also read about a Chinese couple facilitated by forerunners healthcare were able to get their baby by IVF and a surrogate mother.<br>  <br>  My cousin and her husband got their IVF treatment in India through the forerunners healthcare in India and is all praise for this company. She is a known case of PCOS.She is a very happy mother of a baby boy now. She just paid 2500 pounds for the full treatment for which she was quoted 8000 pounds in private setup in UK.I strongly recommend this company to you as they can be of great help to you. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com</a>|`|8f5cdbb620c5dc4ec50e46b43bf0a233aa	I almost went through an IVF when I was going through my fertility treatments. I went through the injections and everything, but since I have PCOS, a lot of my follicles didn't mature and I only ended up with 3. My doctor felt that if we were to go through with the IVF, my chances of becoming pregnant was very slim since after she'd retrieve my eggs, I'd be lucky to have 1 good egg after the whole process was done. I ended up doing 2 inseminations instead. <br>  <br>  Anyway, the doctor or nurse practitioner will give you a schedule for your doses and depending on your case, you will be doing different meds at different doses. They will teach you and your partner how to do the injections. Anyway, my injections lasted every day (morning and night) for a couple of weeks. In the morning, the injection was on my thigh and at night, the injections were on my backside (my butt). The needles are very fine, so they don't really hurt. They started to sting a little after awhile, but still bearable. I think it also depends on your pain threshold. It's also advised to alternate legs each time. I didn't have any symptoms or side effects, but everyone's different.<br>  <br>  My inseminations were unsuccessful (I did conceive naturally; I'm 5 months now!), but I have a couple of friends who had successful pregnancies via IFV.<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust to you!!!|`|AA12227720	I have no idea... but I wish you the best.  I bet you are pretty excited!  I am going through clomid and HCG shots right now.  Don't you just hate all of this...

They are given with a small needle into the stomach. The side effects that I noticed were: 1) Extremely sore, tender breasts (it hurt to even walk with any kind of bounce); 2) Headaches (every evening); and 3) Moodiness (everything made me cry).<br>  <br>  The second round of injections after the implanation were a little more difficult. They were given with a large needle into the buttocks or leg. I did not notice any side effects with this medication.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and I wish you the best.

I have endometeriosis.<br>  <br>  You really need to be tested before you can determine which treatments would be best for you. For example if you have blocked tubes, then IUI would not work for you and your best option would be IVF. Ask your Fertility Doctor for some literature about your options. Being educated about your body, tests, treatments and options is your best defense against your infertility.|`|8c9a18ab54458aacb5654333ef3fe545aa	IVF (in vitro fertilization) treatment; IUI, ICSI and Laparoscopic surgery is very cheap in India.

I did IVF in June and transferred 2 embryos and they did not take so now we have to use our remaining frozen embryo in a few weeks.  I feel like I've been through the ringer so if you can do IUI and have success I think emotionally, physically and mentally it's the better way to go.  I chose IVF because my doctor didn't think IUI would work as dh had low sperm count.|`|8f5cdbb620c5dc4ec50e46b43bf0a233aa	This is tough, but It's really up to you. The chances of becoming pregnant are greater with IVF, but the chances of having multiple births are higher with IUI. IUI is less invasive than IVF and IVF is more expensive. <br>  <br>  I have PCOS and I had 2 unsuccessful IUI's. I was supposed to have an IVF, but a few days before, my doctor had me pull out of it and opt for an IUI instead. I only had 3 mature eggs after my shots and she said that my chances of becoming pregnant through IVF were a lot slimmer than doing an IUI at that point because of the procedure, I may have only ended up with 1 good egg (maybe). <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|AA12291177	my first question is why did you dr. wait 4 years to send you all my dr. said go after 1 year.<br>  i have done all of the choices we did 3 tries of IUI then went to IVF. I would say start with IUI cause if you get pg on that then you dont have to mess  if ivf which is much more complicated a lot more dr. appointments, more meds more abuse to your body that may not be needed if IUI works. <br>  But if you can only afford a few treatments then you may want to skip all the small stuff go for the big guns. <br>  I started with meds then worked up to IVF each treatment take more time and more work. You have to do what you think you can handle eithor cause of money or just plain old stress.  Goood luck|`|d5b49e7e0402ae95bc59fca170f600d8aa	My mom got ITI, but from donor sperm. She's a single mom by choice. I'm not fond of any AI procedure, but I would at least advise you NOT to ever use donor sperm. I think the first thing you should know about that is since you are married, generally people who use donor sperm in marriages end up having failed marriages (the husband can't deal with the fact that his wife chose someone over him). But the main concern is that of the future problems you will be creating in other people, people you are supposed to love- the child(ren) you create from this with donor sperm. It is hell to grow up this way, not knowing half of yourself and not knowing who your siblings are. Passing every man on the street and wondering if any of them are "him" is heartwrenching- as is asking every person you date what their dad did in their past, just to make sure you're not dating a sibling. Our situation is not looked at enough by people considering donor sperm for themselves, when really it is what should be the first thing considered. I'm not disregarding your desire for a child, but in your desire for your child you want what's best for them, right? The pain that we carry in our hearts and every part of our being is the cause of our parents neglect, even if they had good intentions. And this isn't to say that we don't love our parents- we do (well, most of us). But all of us would rather have been born into circumstances where we at least had a chance to know our fathers, or know that he existed. We may be a minority, but there are a good deal of us running around yearning to know our kin- the eldest that I know of us is in their 60s, and will never know their father. It really is a tragedy. Please look further into this case, into our cases before you make a choice. I pray you don't use donor sperm, I really do. And please, message me back if you have any questions. I'd be happy to answer any you may have.|`|0c15b3ecd58b1ea81cdb8ca8495eb1e3aa	I am 31 and my husband is 33. We have been trying for 4 years.  We did two IUIs but no luck.

AA10644766	Betty, to get pregnant you must have sex on a day that your eggs are being released.<br>  <br>  After the 3rd day from the day that menses started put a thermometer into your mouth and check your body temperature every morning before you start turning in bed. The best time is at about 4 a.m. Maintain a chart. You will find that on one day the body temperature drops from 1/2 degree to one degree. This is the day that your eggs are being released. If you want to get pregnant this is the day that you must have sex. Tell your husband to ejaculate on his inward thrust so that the sperms will shoot deep inside.<br>  <br>  After having sex you must stay in bed for about 30 mins with your knees bent up with a pillow under your buttocks so that the sperms will not pour out - to enable them to travel up. <br>  <br>  Get your husband to save his sperms in the testacles for at least 3 days before sex to enable them to mature well to do their job.|`|9d4fb70ede70c409d894d99c20ede628aa	Both you and your husband should get tested, he should get tested to see if all his sperm counts are okay, you should get tested to make sure your tubes are open, see if you have any disorderes like PCOS, Endometrosis, annovulatory cycles, etc.|`|1ffc303db15fdc00d04d05f7b03f2f53aa	I completely agree with Tammybaby.  Although my OBGYN doesn't call me weekly to see how I'm doing, he is very knowledgeable and is continually updating his education and learning about the latest research in fertility options.  I live in a large metropolitan area and have access to many specialists, but I am very comfortable with my OBGYN and trust him completely.  I was able to conceive my daughter under his care.  Although it took 13 months, I don't think I would've conceived any quicker with a fertility specialist.  I am currently in my 6th month ttc again.  <br>  I suggest finding a doctor that you feel comfortable with, whether it be an OBGYN or fertility specialist.  Discuss medical histories - both you and your partner, get an exam done and have some routine blood work done.  Make sure to write down any and all questions before your appointment.  Best of luck to you!|`|2d0d6c58ccc9359265c2888aafcbbce2aa	First off I have to strongly disagree with Chel.  My Ob/gyn has a higher pregnancy success rate than ALL fertility specialists around my town and we have some of the best here in Louisville.  Our Louisville's Women Pavillion has been ranked in the top 5 in the states.  An Ob/gyn has all the skills and means necessary to help a woman achieve pregnancy.  I lucked out with my doctor.  He only takes 3 new patients a year and they must be special cases.  He calls me every week just to see how I'm feeling and to find out if anything new is happening with me or if I have any new questions.  Now how many doctors do you know that do that?  I was in his office a couple of weeks ago and there was a 50 year old woman there that had just found out she was pregnant for the first time!  I have been to many fertility specialists over the years and I have NEVER come across one as caring and interested in my well being as my Ob/gyn.  I was told by the specialists that I would never be able to have children.  I now have high hopes because my doctor assures me that we can achieve pregnancy and will do so probably within the next 6 months. <br>  As for your question, we have been trying for many years and I pretty much have given up.  I found out that I have PCOS and am now being treated with Metformin.  I have never had regular periods in my life ( 1 - 4 years apart).  Now my periods are 28 days like clockwork and I'M OVULATING!!! Just hang in there sweetie.  I have gotten a lot of advice over the years (just relax, have sex everyday, dont worry it will happen, put a pillow under your hips, etc.....) and when you are trying to conceive nothing helps.  No offense but especially advice from people who already have children and have gotten pregnant without trying.<br>  I try not to give advice that I know won't help.  So, my only advice is find a doctor that you feel comfortable with and one that knows what he's doing and don't give up.  I am 39 years young and trying for 1st.  Good Luck to you and Baby Dust to all TTC!|`|6c22f7c824b1883afbd971c26d13fbb8aa	If you have been trying unsuccessfully for one year, go see a fertility specialist.  DO NOT use your OB/GYN for this.  They have limited experience and knowlege in infertility although they dabble with it.  Go to a fertility clinic.  You will get right down to the bottom of what the problem is rather than wasting another year, more $ and stress.  Secondly, if intervention is needed to assist with pregnancy, you are already at the right place to get to your goal - A BABY!  Hope this helps.  I learned the hard way.|`|fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	I agree with Chel. <br>  <br>  I have been trying to conceive for over three years now. I recommend to all people trying for over a year to see a Fertility Specialist rather than your Ob-Gyn. Your Ob-Gyn will try various medications and treatments without testing for any problems. When I first starting trying my Ob-Gyn put me on Clomid for three cycles with no success before I demanded he refer me to a Fertility Specialist. After one visit with my new doctor, he informed me that the medication that my Ob-Gyn had me on had actually regressed my treatment by several months.<br>  <br>  Don't hestiate to see a Specialist. It will save you money in the long run.|`|d3bf68e731813dc0d20434a6a5f4b6d3aa	Have you tried seeing a dr, they can be alot of help after my first son was born my husband and I couldnt get pregnant no matter what we tried, so we went and saw a dr he helped us out alot 2 weeks later I was pregnant.

Good luck I hope something works for you.....
AA11413772	First of all, make sure that he thinks that.  You dont wanna walk up to him and go, "I don't like you/I dont have a crush on you!"  This is b/c it sounds defensive and he might think that you mean the opposite.  Just ignore it unless you are sure that he thinks that.  If you are sure, just tell him gently that he got the wrong impression and that, although he's an ok guy, you just dont feel that way about him.  Dont say it too harshly, b/c even if he doesnt like u, it would still hurt.  Tell him that he can relax, that you like somebody else.  Actually, scratch that last part.  If you say that u like sum1 else, he might ask who and cause another problem.  If you are sure that he assumes that u like him, just tell him that no, you dont.  End of story.|`|AA11809023	Nothing.

fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	Maybe you should try a different doctor. If you are not comfortable with your doctor, then how can you discuss your problems. His recommendation to see a Fertility Specialist is a great idea though. You need to determine for a fact what is causing your infertility. If you believe that you have problems with your tubes, then Clomid is not going to help you.<br>  <br>  My Ob-Gyn put me on Clomid for three cycles before I went to see a Specialist. Then my Specialist informed me that the Clomid actually set me back several months. (It caused my uterine lining to decrease in thickness each month that I was on it.) <br>  <br>  Your visits to the Fertility Specialist can be expensive. Always check with your insurance carrier prior to your appointment for pre-qualification. If your insurance doesn't cover you, then try other options. Check out this website: <a href="http://www.capitalonehealthcarefinance.com/fertility/" rel="nofollow">http://www.capitalonehealthcarefinance.c...</a><br>  You can finance your fertility treatments through them for very low rates and low monthly payments. (That is what my husband and I did).<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|2d0d6c58ccc9359265c2888aafcbbce2aa	Did your doctor do an ultrasound to find out about the scarring?  Ask him again to check for this and if he refuses then you may want to seek out another doctor.  I was on Clomid for 3 months (100mg each) but did not ovulate with it.  The only side effects that I had on it were a few hot flashes.  I took it at night before going to bed so they didn't really bother me.  I don't know about insurance in Michigan but I know that no company in Kentucky covers infertility.  The Clomid is the most inexpensive form of fertility drugs, in Ky its $40.00 for 10 pills.  Hope this helped a little, good luck ttc|`|ea632a7eec5ea8bec7e4e0f58d7175f1aa	Well, the only way to tell if there is scaring on your fallopian tubes is to get a pelvic ultra sound.  I would ask for that.  <br>  I can't answer any of your other questions but I have been on Clomid several times and have never had any side effects.
867e8c8a1ff86573f408861beb022285aa	The cause of endometriosis is unknown. Some experts believe that pieces of endometrium travel back through the fallopian tubes and pass out into the pelvic cavity (space inside the pelvis that holds the reproductive organs). Tiny pieces of tissue may lodge on surfaces of the reproductive organs. During menstruation, the tissue bleeds, just like the endometrium inside the uterus. Blood from these areas can cause irritation of the surrounding tissue which may become swollen and inflamed. Over time, scar tissue and cysts can form. <br>  <br>  What Are the Symptoms of Endometriosis? <br>  <br>  Many times, endometriosis has no symptoms. When symptoms are present, they may include: <br>  <br>  Abdominal cramps or back pain during menstruation. <br>  Very painful menstrual cramps. <br>  Painful bowel movements. <br>  Painful urination, especially during menstruation. <br>  Abnormal or heavy bleeding during periods. <br>  Painful sex. <br>  Difficulty becoming pregnant. <br>  <br>  I was diagnosed with it in Dec 2005.

You can get it at any age.|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	The lining of the uterus just starts wearing out and then it is harder for the uterus to shred the lining so it starts to grow into the uterus wall making it all that much harder and then you have a thick stringy mess that hardly contracts enough to completely shed for a healthy period so you just bleed and bleed and clot and it is very nasty stuff.|`|AA11291782	If you have it endo since i was 14 it is something your born with that cant be diagnosed till you get your periods.<br>  I have severe endo some have it only slightly and it doesn't effect them on having children except taking a little longer .<br>  I found out a low carb diet exercise are things that can help with reg periods and less pain which has helped me while I'm still not pregnant , that's not in my hands its in Gods and with prayer i know miracles can happen|`|fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	It is still unknown what causes endometriosis. I have severe and agressive endometriosis. My symptoms first started when I was 22 (over 7 years ago). I have severe pain during my periods. <br>  <br>  My doctor is a strong believer that it is hereditary. And I believe him. All of the females on my father's side of the family have had 'female' problems too. <br>  <br>  If you have endo, get the surgery to help elevate some of the pain. If you do not have a severe case, then it should help you with the pain and with your infertility. Good Luck!!
752dae63ebe2a79c118bfda479a539f7aa	You should see your Dr, 48 days is a long time if you arent on any birth control pills (Seasonale gives you a three month cycle). It will give you piece of mind to know what is going on whether you are PG or not.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the tests dont work because the hormone level isnt high enough for the test to read it, but 48 days would make you 5-6 weeks and the tests would pick up the levels by now. Call your Dr, if it turns out that you arent PG (which I would doubt) they can give you medicine to help you get your period.

Good luck!|`|AA12381247	Original Article:<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/infertility/DS00310" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/inferti...</a> <br>   <br>  Infertility<br>  Introduction<br>  You and your partner have tried for months, perhaps for even more than a year. But despite sexual intercourse without birth control, you've been unable to conceive a child.<br>  If you've been trying to conceive for more than a year, there's a good chance that something may be interfering with your efforts to have a child. Infertility, also known as subfertility, is the inability to conceive a child within one year. Infertility may be due to a single cause in either you or your partner, or a combination of factors that may prevent a pregnancy from occurring or continuing.<br>  Infertility differs from sterility. Being sterile means you're unable to conceive a child. With sterility, you or your partner has a physical problem that precludes the ability to conceive. A diagnosis of infertility simply means that becoming pregnant may be a challenge rather than an impossibility.<br>  Signs and symptoms<br>  Most men with fertility problems have no signs or symptoms. Some men with hormonal problems may note a change in their voice or pattern of hair growth, enlargement of their breasts, or difficulty with sexual function. Infertility in women may be signaled by irregular menstrual periods or associated with conditions that cause pain during menstruation or intercourse.<br>  Causes<br>   <br>  The human reproductive process is complex. To accomplish a pregnancy, the intricate processes of ovulation and fertilization need to work just right. For many couples attempting pregnancy, something goes wrong in one or both of these complex processes and causes infertility. Because of the intricate series of events required to begin a pregnancy, many factors may cause a delay in starting your family.<br>  Every month the pituitary gland in a woman's brain sends a signal to her ovaries to prepare an egg for ovulation. The pituitary hormones — follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) — are involved in stimulating the ovaries to bring an egg to ovulation. A large boost in LH carries a message to the ovarian follicle to release its egg (ovulate). A woman is most fertile at the time of ovulation — around day 14 of her menstrual cycle — although the exact time of ovulation varies among women due to different lengths of menstrual cycles.<br>  The egg is then captured by a fallopian tube and is viable for about 24 hours, but its best chance of being fertilized is within the first 12 hours following ovulation. For pregnancy to occur, a sperm must unite with the egg in the fallopian tube during this time. Sperm are capable of fertilizing the egg for up to 72 hours and must be present in the fallopian tube at the same time as the egg for conception to occur. If fertilized, the egg moves into the uterus two to four days later. There it attaches to the uterine lining and begins a nine-month process of growth.<br>  In order for a sperm to reach an egg, many factors are involved in the male fertility process. There must be enough sperm, they must be of the right shape and they must move in the right way. There must be enough semen to transport the sperm. The man also needs to be able to have an erection, and must be able to ejaculate the semen and deliver it into the vagina.<br>  The cause or causes of infertility can involve one or both partners. For many couples having problems with fertility, the male partner is either the sole or a contributing cause. Problems with female fertility are common as well, but present less often than those in the male partner. In both men and women, multiple factors can account for difficulty with fertility. Sometimes the problem isn't really one of infertility, but a more general sexual problem such as erectile dysfunction. Other times, the problem may involve an abnormality in the structure of the reproductive hormones or organs. Certain infections and diseases also can affect fertility.<br>  Causes of male infertility<br>  A number of causes exist for male infertility that may result in impaired sperm count or mobility, or impaired ability to fertilize the egg. The most common causes of male infertility include abnormal sperm production or function, impaired delivery of sperm, conditions related to a man's general health and lifestyle, and overexposure to certain environmental elements:<br>  Abnormal sperm production or function. Most cases of male infertility are due to sperm abnormalities, such as:<br>  ·Impaired shape and movement of sperm. Sperm must be properly shaped and able to move rapidly and accurately toward the egg for fertilization to occur. If the shape and structure (morphology) of the sperm are abnormal or the movement (motility) is impaired, sperm may not be able to reach the egg. <br>  ·Absent sperm production in testicles. Complete failure of the testicles to produce sperm is rare, affecting very few infertile men. <br>  ·Low sperm concentration. A normal sperm concentration is greater than or equal to 20 million sperm per milliliter of semen. A count of 10 million or fewer sperm per milliliter of semen indicates low sperm concentration (subfertility). A count of 40 million sperm or higher per milliliter of semen indicates increased fertility. <br>  ·Varicocele. A varicocele is a varicose vein in the scrotum that may prevent normal cooling of the testicle and raise testicular temperature, preventing sperm from surviving. <br>  ·Undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). This occurs when one or both testicles fail to descend from the abdomen into the scrotum during fetal development. Undescended testicles can cause mild to severely impaired sperm production. Because the testicles are exposed to the higher internal body temperature compared to the temperature in the scrotum, sperm production may be affected. <br>  ·Testosterone deficiency (male hypogonadism). Infertility can result from disorders of the testicles themselves, or an abnormality affecting the hypothalamus or pituitary glands in the brain that produce the hormones that control the testicles. <br>  ·Klinefelter's syndrome. In this disorder of the sex chromosomes, a man has two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome instead of one X and one Y. This causes abnormal development of the testicles, resulting in low or absent sperm production. Testosterone production also may be lower. <br>  ·Infections. Infection may temporarily affect sperm motility. Repeated bouts of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, are most often associated with male infertility. These infections can cause scarring and block sperm passage. Mycoplasma is an organism that may fasten itself to sperm cells, making them less motile. If mumps, a viral infection usually affecting young children, occurs after puberty, inflammation of the testicles can impair sperm production. Inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis), urethra or epididymis also may alter sperm motility. <br>  In many instances, no cause for reduced sperm production is found. When sperm concentration is less than 5 million per milliliter of semen, genetic causes could be involved. A blood test can reveal whether there are subtle changes in the Y chromosome.<br>  Impaired delivery of sperm. Problems with the delivery of sperm from the penis into the vagina can cause infertility. These may include:<br>  ·Sexual issues. Often treatable, problems with sexual intercourse or technique may affect fertility. Difficulties with erection of the penis (erectile dysfunction), premature ejaculation, painful intercourse (dyspareunia), or psychological or relationship problems can contribute to infertility. Use of lubricants such as oils or petroleum jelly can be toxic to sperm and impair fertility. <br>  ·Retrograde ejaculation. This occurs when semen enters the bladder during orgasm rather than emerging out through the penis. Various conditions can cause retrograde ejaculation including diabetes, bladder, prostate or urethral surgery, and the use of psychiatric or antihypertensive drugs. <br>  ·Blockage of epididymis or ejaculatory ducts. Some men are born with blockage of the part of the testicle that contains sperm (epididymis) or ejaculatory ducts. And some men who seek treatment for infertility lack the tubes that carry sperm (vasa deferentia). <br>  ·No semen (ejaculate). The absence of ejaculate may occur in men with spinal cord injuries or diseases. This fluid transports sperm through the penis into the vagina. <br>  ·Misplaced urinary opening (hypospadias). A birth defect can cause the urinary (urethral) opening to be abnormally located on the underside of the penis. If not surgically corrected, this condition can prevent sperm from reaching the cervix. <br>  ·Anti-sperm antibodies. Antibodies that target sperm and weaken or disable them usually occur after surgical blockage of part of the vas deferens for male sterilization (vasectomy). Presence of these antibodies may complicate the reversal of a vasectomy. <br>  ·Cystic fibrosis. Men with cystic fibrosis often have missing or obstructed vasa deferentia. <br>  General health and lifestyle. A man's general health and lifestyle may affect fertility. Some common causes of infertility related to health and lifestyle include:<br>  ·Emotional stress. Stress may interfere with certain hormones needed to produce sperm. Your sperm count may be affected if you experience excessive or prolonged emotional stress. A problem with fertility itself can sometimes become long term and discouraging, producing more stress. Infertility can affect social relationships and sexual functioning. <br>  ·Malnutrition. Deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamin C, selenium, zinc and folate may contribute to infertility. <br>  ·Obesity. Increased body mass may be associated with fertility problems in men. <br>  ·Cancer and its treatment. Both radiation and chemotherapy treatment for cancer can impair sperm production, sometimes severely. The closer radiation treatment is to the testicles, the higher the risk of infertility. Removal of one or both testicles due to cancer also may affect male fertility. You may want to consider freezing (cryopreserving) your sperm before cancer treatment to ensure future fertility. <br>  ·Alcohol and drugs. Alcohol or drug dependency can be associated with general ill health and reduced fertility. The use of certain drugs also can contribute to infertility. Anabolic steroids, for example, which are taken to stimulate muscle strength and growth, can cause the testicles to shrink and sperm production to decrease. <br>  ·Other medical conditions. A severe injury or major surgery can affect male fertility. Certain diseases or conditions, such as diabetes, thyroid disease, HIV/AIDS, Cushing's syndrome, anemia, heart attack, and liver or kidney failure, may be associated with infertility. <br>  ·Age. A gradual decline in fertility is common in men older than 35. <br>  Environmental exposure. Overexposure to certain environmental elements such as heat, toxins and chemicals can reduce sperm count either directly by affecting testicular function or indirectly by altering the male hormonal system. Specific causes include:<br>  ·Pesticides and other chemicals. Herbicides and insecticides may cause female hormone-like effects in the male body and may be associated with reduced sperm production. Exposure to such chemicals also may contribute to testicular cancer. Men exposed to hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene, benzene, toluene, xylen and aromatic solvents used in paint, varnishes, glues, metal degreasers and other products, may be at risk of infertility. Men with high exposure to lead also may be more at risk. <br>  ·Testicular exposure to overheating. Frequent use of saunas or hot tubs can elevate your core body temperature. This may impair your sperm production and lower your sperm count. <br>  ·Substance abuse. Cocaine or heavy marijuana use may temporarily reduce the number and quality of your sperm. <br>  ·Tobacco smoking. Men who smoke may have a lower sperm count than do those who don't smoke. <br>  Causes of female infertility<br>  The most common causes of female infertility include fallopian tube damage or blockage, endometriosis, ovulation disorders, elevated prolactin, polycystic ovary syndrome, early menopause, benign uterine fibroids and pelvic adhesions:<br>  Fallopian tube damage or blockage. This condition usually results from inflammation of the fallopian tube (salpingitis). Chlamydia is the most frequent cause. Tubal inflammation may go unnoticed or cause pain and fever.<br>  Tubal damage with scarring is the major risk factor of a pregnancy in which the fertilized egg is unable to make its way through the fallopian tube to implant in the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). One episode of tubal infection may cause fertility difficulties. The risk of ectopic pregnancy increases with each occurrence of tubal infection.<br>  Endometriosis. Endometriosis occurs when the tissue that makes up the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus. This tissue most commonly is implanted on the ovaries or the lining of the abdomen near the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. These implants respond to the hormonal cycle and grow, shed and bleed in sync with the lining of the uterus each month, which can lead to scarring and inflammation. Pelvic pain and infertility are common in women with endometriosis.<br>  Infertility in endometriosis also may be due to:<br>  ·Ovarian cysts (endometriomas). Ovarian cysts may indicate advanced endometriosis and often are associated with reduced fertility. Endometriomas can be treated with surgery. <br>  ·Scar tissue. Endometriosis may cause rigid webs of scar tissue between the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes. This may prevent the transfer of the egg to the fallopian tube. <br>  Ovulation disorders. Some cases of female infertility are caused by ovulation disorders. Disruption in the part of the brain that regulates ovulation (hypothalamic-pituitary axis) can cause deficiencies in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Even slight irregularities in the hormone system can affect ovulation.<br>  Specific causes of hypothalamic-pituitary disorders include:<br>  ·Direct injury to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland <br>  ·Pituitary tumors <br>  ·Excessive exercise <br>  ·Anorexia nervosa <br>  Elevated prolactin (hyperprolactinemia). The hormone prolactin stimulates breast milk production. High levels in women who aren't pregnant or nursing may affect ovulation. An elevation in prolactin levels may also indicate the presence of a pituitary tumor. In addition, some drugs can elevate levels of prolactin. Milk flow not related to pregnancy or nursing (galactorrhea) can be a sign of high prolactin.<br>  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). An increase in androgen hormone production causes PCOS. In women with increased body mass, elevated androgen production may come from stimulation by higher levels of insulin. In lean women, the elevated levels of androgen may be stimulated by a higher ratio of luteinizing hormone (LH). Lack of menstruation (amenorrhea) or infrequent menses (oligomenorrhea) are common symptoms in women with PCOS.<br>  In PCOS, increased androgen production prevents the follicles of the ovaries from producing a mature egg. Small follicles that start to grow but can't mature to ovulation remain within the ovary. A persistent lack of ovulation may lead to mild enlargement of the ovaries.<br>  Without ovulation, the hormone progesterone isn't produced and estrogen levels remain constant. Elevated levels of androgen may cause increased dark or thick hair on the chin, upper lip or lower abdomen as well as acne and oily skin.<br>  Early menopause (premature ovarian failure). Early menopause is the absence of menstruation and the early depletion of ovarian follicles before age 35. Although the cause is often unknown, certain conditions are associated with early menopause, including:<br>  ·Autoimmune disease. The body produces antibodies to attack its own tissue, in this case the ovary. This may be associated with hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone). <br>  ·Radiation or chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer. <br>  ·Tobacco smoking. <br>  Benign uterine fibroids.Fibroids are benign tumors in the wall of the uterus and are common in women in their 30s. Occasionally they may cause infertility by interfering with the contour of the uterine cavity, blocking the fallopian tubes.<br>  Pelvic adhesions. Pelvic adhesions are bands of scar tissue that bind organs after pelvic infection, appendicitis, or abdominal or pelvic surgery. They may limit the functioning of the ovaries and fallopian tubes and impair fertility. Scar tissue formation inside the uterine cavity after a surgical procedure may result in a closed uterus and ceased menstruation (Asherman's syndrome). This is most common following surgery to control uterine bleeding after giving birth.<br>  Other causes. A number of other causes can lead to infertility in women:<br>  ·Medications. Temporary infertility may occur with the use of certain medications. In most cases, fertility is restored when the medication is stopped. <br>  ·Thyroid problems. Disorders of the thyroid gland, either too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) or too little (hypothyroidism), can interrupt the menstrual cycle and cause infertility. <br>  ·Cancer and its treatment. Certain cancers — particularly female reproductive cancers — often severely impair female fertility. Both radiation and chemotherapy may affect a woman's ability to reproduce. Chemotherapy may impair reproductive function and fertility more severely in men than in women. <br>  ·Other medical conditions. Medical conditions associated with delayed puberty or amenorrhea, such as Cushing's disease, sickle cell disease, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease and diabetes, can affect a woman's fertility. <br>  Risk factors<br>  Many of the risk factors for both male and female infertility are the same. They include:<br>  ·Age. Age is the strongest predictor of female fertility. After about age 32, a woman's fertility potential gradually declines. A woman does not renew her oocytes (eggs). Infertility in older women may be due to a higher risk of chromosomal abnormalities that occur in the eggs as they age. Older women are also more likely to have health problems that may interfere with fertility. The risk of miscarriage also increases with a woman's age. A gradual decline in fertility is possible in men older than 35. <br>  ·Tobacco smoking. Women who smoke tobacco may reduce their chances of becoming pregnant and the possible benefit of fertility treatment. Miscarriages are more frequent in women who smoke. <br>  ·Alcohol. There's no certain level of safe alcohol use during conception or pregnancy. <br>  ·Body mass. Extremes in body mass — either too high (body mass index, or BMI, of greater than 25.0) or too low (BMI of lower than 20.0) — may affect ovulation and increase the risk of infertility. <br>  ·Being overweight. Among American women, infertility often is due to a sedentary lifestyle and being overweight. <br>  ·Being underweight. Women at risk include those with eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia, and women following a very low-calorie or restrictive diet. Strict vegetarians also may experience infertility problems due to a lack of important nutrients such as vitamin B-12, zinc, iron and folic acid. Marathon runners, dancers and others who exercise very intensely are more prone to menstrual irregularities and infertility. <br>  When to seek medical advice<br>  In general, don't be concerned about infertility unless you and your partner have been trying regularly to conceive for at least one year. However, if you plan to conceive and you're a woman older than 30 or haven't had a menstrual flow for longer than six months, seek a medical evaluation. If you have a history of irregular or painful menstrual cycles, pelvic pain, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or repeated miscarriages, schedule a consultation with your doctor sooner. If you're a man with a low sperm count or a history of testicular, prostate or sexual problems, consider seeking help earlier.<br>  Screening and diagnosis<br>  If you and your partner are unable to achieve conception within a reasonable time and would like to do so, seek help. The woman's gynecologist, the man's urologist or your family doctor can determine whether there's a problem that requires a specialist or clinic that treats infertility problems.<br>  Some infertile couples have more than one cause of their infertility. Thus, your doctor will usually begin a comprehensive infertility examination of both you and your partner.<br>  Before undergoing infertility testing, be aware that a certain amount of commitment is required. Your doctor or clinic will need to determine what your sexual habits are and may make recommendations about how you may need to change those habits. The tests and periods of trial and error may extend over several months.<br>  Evaluation is expensive and in some cases involves operations and uncomfortable procedures, and the expenses may not be reimbursed by many medical plans. Finally, there's no guarantee, even after all testing and counseling, that conception will occur. However, for couples who are eager to have their own child, such an evaluation is best. It may result in a successful pregnancy.<br>  Tests for men<br>  For a man to be fertile, the testicles must produce enough healthy sperm, and the sperm must be ejaculated effectively into the woman's vagina. Tests for male infertility attempt to determine whether any of these processes are impaired.<br>  ·General physical examination. This includes examination of your genitals and questions concerning your medical history, illnesses and disabilities, medications and sexual habits. <br>  ·Semen analysis. Your doctor may ask for a specimen of ejaculated semen. This is generally obtained by masturbating or by interrupting intercourse and ejaculating your semen into a clean container. Your doctor will provide instructions. Such a specimen may be required more than once. A laboratory analyzes your semen specimen for quantity, color and presence of infections or blood. Detailed analysis of the sperm also is done. The laboratory will determine the number of sperm present and any abnormalities in the shape and movement (motility) of the sperm. Often sperm counts fluctuate from one specimen to the next. <br>  ·Hormone testing. A blood test to determine the level of testosterone and other male hormones is common. <br>  Tests for women<br>  For a woman to be fertile, the ovaries must release healthy eggs regularly, and her reproductive tract must allow the eggs and sperm to pass into her fallopian tubes for a possible union. Her reproductive organs must be healthy and functional.<br>  After your doctor asks questions regarding your health history, menstrual cycle and sexual habits, you'll undergo a general physical examination. This includes a regular gynecologic examination. Specific fertility tests may include:<br>  ·Confirmation of ovulation. A blood test is sometimes performed to determine the levels of hormones involved in successful ovulation. <br>  ·Hysterosalpingography. This test evaluates the condition of your uterus and fallopian tubes. Fluid is injected into your uterus, and an X-ray is taken to determine whether the fluid progresses out of the uterus and into your fallopian tubes and general peritoneal cavity. Blockage or problems often can be located and may be corrected with medication or surgery. <br>  ·Laparoscopy. Performed under general anesthesia, this surgical procedure involves inserting a thin viewing device into your abdomen and pelvis to examine your fallopian tubes, ovaries and uterus. A small incision (8 to 10 millimeters) is made beneath your navel, and a needle is inserted into your abdominal cavity. A small amount of gas (usually carbon dioxide) is inserted into the abdomen to create space for entry of the laparoscope — an illuminated, fiber-optic telescope. <br>  The most common problems identified by laparoscopy are endometriosis and scarring. Your doctor can also detect blockages or irregularities of the fallopian tubes and uterus. Often a blue dye is injected into the cervical canal and through the uterus and fallopian tubes to determine whether they are open. At the end of the procedure, the gas and laparoscope are drawn out and the incision is closed. Laparoscopy generally is done on an outpatient basis.<br>  ·Basal body temperature. Although this test was once a standard, basal body temperature charting is used less often today. Charting a woman's body temperature doesn't give as precise time of ovulation as earlier believed. <br>  ·Urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) detector kits. A number of at-home kits are available to test your LH level. Although these kits may be helpful, they also can be inaccurate and misleading. Consult your doctor before using one. <br>  ·Ovarian reserve testing. Testing may be done to determine the potential effectiveness of the eggs after ovulation. This approach often begins with hormone testing early in a woman's menstrual cycle. <br>  Not everyone needs to undergo all, or even many, of these tests before the cause of infertility is found. Which tests are used and their sequence depend on discussion and agreement between you and your doctor.<br>  Unexplained infertility<br>  In some infertile couples, no specific cause is found (unexplained infertility). Couples receiving the diagnosis of unexplained infertility are more likely to seek multiple health care providers and be influenced by the experiences of family and friends or literature that promises new hope. Although infertility is unexplained, the pregnancy rate for these couples is among the highest.<br>  Complications<br>  Complications of being infertile often involve strong emotions and may trigger negative feelings between you and your partner. These may include:<br>  ·Depression <br>  ·Guilt <br>  ·Anger <br>  ·Stress <br>  ·Disappointment <br>  ·Resentment <br>  ·Blame <br>  ·Fear of losing partner because of infertility <br>  ·Diminished confidence and self-esteem <br>  Treatment <br>  Treatment of infertility depends on the cause, the duration of the problem, the age of the partners and their specific wishes. Some causes of infertility can't be corrected. However, various means of insemination or embryo transfer may be possible so that a woman can still become pregnant.<br>  Nonsurgical fertility treatment falls into two main categories:<br>  ·Restoring or bringing about fertility <br>  ·Assisted reproductive technology (ART) <br>  Restoring or bringing about fertility<br>  These approaches can involve steps related to the male or to the female, or both.<br>  Sperm survive in the female reproductive tract for up to 72 hours, and an egg can be fertilized for up to 24 hours after ovulation. Increasing the frequency of intercourse increases the chances for conception.<br>  Other approaches that involve the male include:<br>  ·Treatment of general sexual problems. Addressing impotence or premature ejaculation can improve fertility. Treatment for these problems often is with medication or behavioral approaches. <br>  ·Addressing lack of sperm. When the source of infertility lies in the man's sperm, or lack of it, restoring or initiating fertility is sometimes possible. For example, in some instances, surgical correction of a varicocele will restore fertility. Problems with the testicles, prostate gland, seminal vesicle and urethra also can be treated. When sperm production is impaired because of damage to the sperm-producing areas of the testicle, drug treatment has little benefit. In rare instances when sperm production is impaired because of a pituitary problem, treatment with pituitary hormones called gonadotropins may help. When infection hampers sperm production, both you and your partner will need treatment. <br>  Fertility drugs (ovulation induction)<br>  Fertility drugs are the primary treatment for women who are infertile due to ovulation disorders. These medications regulate or induce ovulation. In general, they exert actions designed to work like natural follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Commonly used fertility drugs include:<br>  ·Clomiphene citrate (Clomid, Serophene). This drug is taken orally and stimulates ovulation in women who have PCOS or other ovulatory disorders. It causes the pituitary gland to release more FSH and LH, which stimulate the growth of an ovarian follicle containing an egg. <br>  ·Human menopausal gonadotropin, or hMG (Repronex, Pergonal). This injected prescription medication is for women who don't menstruate on their own due to the failure of the pituitary gland to stimulate ovulation. Unlike clomiphene, which stimulates the pituitary gland, hMG and other gonadotropins directly stimulate the ovaries. This drug contains both FSH and LH. <br>  ·Follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH (Gonal-F, Follistim, Bravelle). FSH is essentially hMG without the LH. Like hMG, it works by stimulating the ovaries to mature egg follicles. <br>  ·Human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG (Ovidrel, Pregnyl). Used in combination with clomiphene, hMG and FSH, this drug stimulates the follicle to release its egg (ovulate). <br>  ·Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) analogs. This treatment is for women with irregular ovulatory cycles or who ovulate prematurely — before the lead follicle is mature enough — during hMG treatment. Gn-RH analogs deliver constant Gn-RH to the pituitary gland, which alters hormone production, so that a physician can induce follicle growth with FSH. <br>  ·Letrozole (Femara). This drug is in a class of medications called aromatase inhibitors, which are approved for treatment of advanced breast cancer. Doctors sometimes prescribe letrozole for women who don't ovulate on their own and who haven't responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate. Letrozole is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for inducing ovulation. The drug's manufacturer has warned doctors not to use the drug for fertility purposes because of possible adverse health effects. These adverse effects may include birth defects and miscarriage. <br>  ·Metformin (Glucophage). This oral drug is taken to boost ovulation. It's used when insulin resistance is known or suspected. <br>  ·Bromocriptine. This medication is for women whose ovulation cycles are irregular due to elevated levels of prolactin, the hormone that stimulates milk production in new mothers. Bromocriptine inhibits prolactin production. <br>  Injectable fertility drugs significantly increase the chance of multiple births. The use of these drugs requires careful monitoring with a combination of blood tests of hormones and ultrasound measurement of ovarian follicle size. Generally, the greater the number of fetuses, the higher the risk of premature labor. Babies born prematurely are at increased risk of health and developmental problems. The risk is greater for triplets than it is for twins or single pregnancies.<br>  The risk of multiple pregnancies can be reduced. If a woman requires an hCG injection to trigger ovulation, and ultrasound exams show that too many follicles have developed, she and her doctor can decide to withhold the hCG injection. For many couples, however, the desire to become pregnant overrides concerns about conceiving multiple babies.<br>  When too many babies are conceived, removal of one or more fetuses (multifetal pregnancy reduction) can offer improved survival odds for the surviving fetuses. This presents serious emotional and ethical challenges for many people. If you and your partner are considering fertility drug treatment, discuss this possibility with your doctor before starting treatment.<br>  There may be a link between fertility drugs and an increased, long-term risk of ovarian cancer. However, the association between fertility drugs and ovarian cancer hasn't been confirmed.<br>  Surgery<br>  Depending on the cause, surgery may be a treatment option for infertility. Blockages or other problems in the fallopian tubes usually can be surgically repaired. Laparoscopy allows delicate operations on the fallopian tubes.<br>  Infertility due to endometriosis often is more difficult to treat. Although hormones such as those found in birth control pills are effective for treating endometriosis and relieving pain, they haven't been useful in treating infertility. If you have endometriosis, your doctor may treat you with ovulation therapy, in which medication is used to stimulate or regulate ovulation, or in vitro fertilization, in which the egg and sperm are joined in the laboratory and transferred to the uterus.<br>  Assisted reproductive technology (ART)<br>  ART has revolutionized the treatment of infertility. Each year thousands of babies are born in the United States as a result of ART. Medical advances have enabled many couples to have their own biological child. An ART health team includes physicians, psychologists, embryologists, laboratory technicians, nurses and allied health professionals who work together to help infertile couples achieve pregnancy.<br>  The most common forms of ART include:<br>  ·In vitro fertilization (IVF). This is the most effective ART technique. IVF involves retrieving mature eggs from a woman, fertilizing them with a man's sperm in a dish in a laboratory and implanting the embryos in the uterus three to five days after fertilization. IVF often is recommended as a first-line therapy and is the treatment of choice if both fallopian tubes are blocked. It's also widely used for a number of other conditions, such as endometriosis, unexplained infertility, cervical factor infertility, male factor infertility and ovulation disorders. <br>  ·Electroejaculation. Electric stimulus brings about ejaculation to obtain semen. This procedure can be used in men with a spinal cord injury who can't otherwise achieve ejaculation. <br>  ·Surgical sperm aspiration. This technique involves removing sperm from part of the male reproductive tract such as the epididymis, vas deferens or testicle. This allows retrieval of sperm if blockage is present. <br>  ·Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). This technique consists of a microscopic technique (micromanipulation) in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg to achieve fertilization in conjunction with the standard IVF procedure. ICSI has been especially helpful in couples who have previously failed to achieve conception with standard techniques. For men with low sperm concentrations, ICSI dramatically improves the likelihood of fertilization. <br>  ·Assisted hatching. This technique attempts to assist the implantation of the embryo into the lining of the uterus. <br>  ART works best when the woman has a healthy uterus, responds well to fertility drugs, and ovulates naturally or uses donor eggs. The man should have healthy sperm, or donor sperm should be available. The success rate of ART gradually diminishes after age 32.<br>  Complications of treatment<br>  Certain complications exist with the treatment of infertility. These include:<br>  ·Multiple pregnancy. Although the most common complication of ART is multiple pregnancy, ART isn't the direct cause of a number of the extreme cases of septuplets or octuplets reported in the media. The number of quality embryos kept and matured to fetuses and birth ultimately is a decision made by the couple. If too many babies are conceived, the removal of one or more fetuses (multifetal pregnancy reduction) is possible to improve survival odds for the other fetuses. <br>  ·Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). If overstimulated, a woman's ovaries may enlarge and cause pain and bloating. Mild to moderate symptoms often resolve without treatment, although pregnancy may delay recovery. Rarely, fluid accumulates in the abdominal cavity and chest, causing abdominal swelling and shortness of breath. This accumulation of fluid can deplete blood volume and lower blood pressure. Severe cases require emergency treatment. Younger women and those who have polycystic ovary syndrome have a higher risk of developing OHSS than do other women. <br>  ·Bleeding or infection. As with any invasive procedure, there is a risk of bleeding or infection. <br>  ·Low birth weight. The greatest risk for low birth weight is a multiple pregnancy. In single live births, there may be a greater chance of low birth weight associated with ART. <br>  ·Birth defects. Significant concern exists regarding the possible relationship between ART and birth defects. More research is necessary to confirm these findings. Weigh this factor if you're considering whether to take advantage of this treatment. ART is the most successful fertility-enhancing therapy to date. <br>  Prevention<br>  Most types of male infertility aren't preventable. However, avoid drug and tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption, which may contribute to male infertility. Also, high temperatures can affect sperm production and motility. Although this effect is usually temporary, avoid hot tubs and steam baths.<br>  If you're a man who's uncertain about whether you would eventually like to become a father, don't undergo permanent sterilization, such as a vasectomy. Although surgery to reverse this condition is possible, risks are involved that could affect fertility in other ways.<br>  A woman can increase her chances of becoming pregnant in a number of ways:<br>  ·Exercise moderately. Regular exercise is important, but if you're exercising so intensely that your periods are infrequent or absent, your fertility is likely to be impaired. <br>  ·Avoid weight extremes. Being overweight or underweight can affect your hormone production and cause infertility. <br>  ·Avoid alcohol, tobacco and street drugs. These substances may impair your ability to conceive or produce a healthy child. Don't drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. Avoid illegal drugs such as marijuana and cocaine. <br>  ·Limit medications. The use of both prescription and nonprescription drugs can decrease your chance of getting pregnant or keeping a pregnancy. Talk with your doctor about any medications you take regularly. <br>  Coping skills<br>  Coping with infertility can be difficult. It's an issue of the unknown — you can't predict how long it will last or what the outcome will be. Infertility isn't necessarily solved with hard work. The emotional burden on a couple is considerable, and plans for coping can help.<br>  Planning for emotional turmoil<br>  ·Set limits. Decide in advance how many and what kind of procedures are emotionally and financially acceptable for you and your partner and attempt to determine a final limit. Fertility treatments may be expensive and often not covered by insurance companies, and a successful pregnancy often depends on repeated attempts. Some couples become so focused on treatment that they continue with fertility procedures until they are emotionally and financially drained. <br>  ·Consider other options. Determine alternatives — adoption, donor sperm or egg, or even having no children — as early as possible in the fertility process. This can reduce anxiety during treatments and feelings of hopelessness if conception doesn't occur. <br>  ·Talk about your feelings. Locate support groups or counseling services for help before and after treatment to help endure the process and ease the grief should treatment fail. <br>  Managing emotional stress during treatment<br>  ·Acupuncture. This ancient therapy may benefit couples who are undergoing fertility treatment. <br>  ·Practice relaxation. Cognitive behavior therapy, which uses methods that include relaxation training and stress management, has been associated with higher pregnancy rates. <br>  ·Express yourself. Reach out to others rather than repressing guilt or anger. <br>  ·Stay in touch with loved ones. Talking to your partner, family and friends can be very beneficial. The best support often comes from loved ones and those closest to you. <br>  Managing emotional effects of the outcome<br>  ·Failure. The emotional stress of failure can be devastating even on the most loving and affectionate relationships and for people who've prepared well for the possibility of failure. Don't hesitate to seek professional help if the emotional burdens become too heavy for you or your partner. <br>  ·Success. Some studies have indicated that even if fertility treatment is successful, women experience increased stress and fear of failure during pregnancy. Other research suggests that women who achieved pregnancy using fertility treatments felt increasingly better and had higher self-esteem and less anxiety as the pregnancy progressed than did women whose pregnancies didn't involve medical intervention. <br>  ·Multiple births. A successful pregnancy that results in multiple births introduces new complexities and emotional problems. The risk of depression is higher in women who have multiple births. <br>  ·Parenting. Once a child arrives, parents are more likely to be more anxious and have less confidence and self-esteem. Discuss becoming parents with your partner and plan for the many changes — challenging and rewarding — that a child will bring to your lives. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  By Mayo Clinic Staff <br>  Jun 15, 2006 <br>  ? 1998-2006 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

So he has us do both just to be on the safe side.|`|AA10762894	THe injections are more effective. The suppositories are really such a mess and because of that, there is a lot of progesterone that gets "lost" instead of being absorbed by your body.|`|fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	I had asked my doctor the same thing. I had used the gel for other treatments. He insisted that I use the shots. He told me that they are more effective. Even though they can be painful, are more inconvenient and more expensive, I feel that if you spend that much money, emotions and energy on the treatment then you should do everything possible to make sure that it is successful. Good Luck!!!
820a73cf560f113ec7b4b70fb5270d0baa	If your contractions are 3-5 and then later 10-15 you just have to wait it out.  active labor contractions are consistant and get closer together and I guarantee you far more painful-to painful for sex.  don't worry though you are on your way.|`|1fe7548a38e463d0ef61dedc26dcf9c4aa	See if the dr will send you to the hospital and break your water.|`|0a415be579ad80a4fe2e26509d841761aa	check into the hospital.  they might be able to give<br>  you something to help with the dilation.  if not you<br>  might be one of those cases when a c-section will<br>  be the only thing to save your baby's life, and possibly <br>  your own.|`|2bc7ef38bb1cece44aae03510a2d045aaa	Yes You need to get to the hospital especially if you are 40 wks already.  They need to keep track of your babys heart rate to make sure it is okay.  And to also help progress the labor they may break your water if it hasn't already done so.  If your not dialated yet, then there may be a chance your baby is to big to fit down the canal and they maybe have to do a c section on you.  Or it could be what my problem is, your canal is to narrow.|`|2d36feed1c7bc190b8b9ea387a6bfb56aa	My advice is more walking. That will help. When they come closer together and you can't walk or talk through them anymore then go to the hospital. <br>  <br>  Walk, walk and more walk. Sex is good too. I don't suggest taking a bath because you could fall or your water could break and you wouldn't know. Good luck to you. Hang in there.|`|4b094d2b4369201324fc28eda525fc2baa	i say you go to the hospital if your having contractions 3-5 mins apart your going into labor get to the hospital imediatly|`|f8c3e5b0d267e0478d825b33f3071c64aa	So, you're 10 months pregnant?
fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	A co-worker of mine had low sperm count, which was the reason after 1 1/2 years of trying they still hadn't conceived. I don't know the name of the procedure that they had completed. But he had an operation to 'open up' his tubes. After 3 months, she was pregnant. They never retested his sperm though. I would check with a Urologist for the percentage because I'm sure that is different with every person. Good Luck!!!|`|AA12301515	Can't help you!
fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	Start charting your Basal Body Tempature. This will help you determine if you are ovulating monthly. You could also use ovulating strips to help you. Good Luck!!|`|a80b0b67a68961550408592424508f71aa	When you get your first period.  Some women take a couple of months others can take a year.  I know not what you wanted to hear, I'm sorry.  It took me 2 months to get normal again.  Good luck to you!!
fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	How did you get a scar on your ovary? I have endometriosis which causes scarring on my ovaries, tubes, uterus and other organs. Each women is different. My chances of conceiving a child naturally was less than 2%. We finally got pregnant by IVF which our chances were 50%. Good Luck!!!|`|21b6d202c67df4a1013753d3ce904052aa	I had sever endometriosis when I was younger. After several surgeries to remove cysts, the doctors told me that my chances of becoming pregnant were very slim due to the scarring I had. However, just a short time after I got married, we were expecting our first child!<br>  <br>  I believe the chances are different for each individual. So many factors (extent of scarring, level of natural fertility, age, etc.) affect fertility that it is difficult to say without knowing a full medical history. <br>  <br>  No matter what, keep trying. We didn't give up and now I have two gorgeous children and have been a surrogate mother three times!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|37addc38b881a2023b765e104e7a7387aa	my mom had something wrong with one of her ovaries, possibly a scar, and she ended up having two more kids...  so it's not impossible.
fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	It sounds like you have a good chance. You definitely had intercourse on the correct days. Each month without clomid you have a 20% chance of conceiving if there are no underlying problems. Good Luck!!!|`|AA12227720	I'm on clomid too.   The dr. told me that women who are not on clomid and have regular cycles have about a 20% chance of becoming pregnant.  Us who are having problems  are about 15%.  I don't think that sounds right... due to the fact that we might be producing more than one ovum which I would think should increase our chances.  You only have a few more days to wait until you can test!!! Best of luck.  If you get antsy (how do you spell that?) get a first response early detection test.  Wait about 10 min before you give up on it... even a fait line is a positive (although w/ 2 k ids you probably already know that)<br>  <br>  Best of luck.. wish me the same.

fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	I am currently pregnant with my first child by IVF. I am assuming since your are asking for advice that you have been having trouble conceiving. If your doctor is recommending IVF, then I always say go for it. My husband and I tried dozens of treatments for over 3 years until we finally gave in to IVF. And it worked for us. <br>  <br>  IVF is a very involved and lengthy process. It requires a lot of determination. Your treatment will last approximately six weeks. It involves lots of doctors visits, blood tests, ultrasounds, and shots. You will have to make very important decisions throughout the entire process.<br>  <br>  I always recommend to couples to do as much research as possible about your condition and IVF. Knowing your options and what is happening makes the emotional rollercoaster that you are about to embark a little easier to handle. Good Luck with your decision!|`|AA12381247	Original Article:<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/infertility/DS00310" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/inferti...</a> <br>   <br>  Infertility<br>  Introduction<br>  You and your partner have tried for months, perhaps for even more than a year. But despite sexual intercourse without birth control, you've been unable to conceive a child.<br>  If you've been trying to conceive for more than a year, there's a good chance that something may be interfering with your efforts to have a child. Infertility, also known as subfertility, is the inability to conceive a child within one year. Infertility may be due to a single cause in either you or your partner, or a combination of factors that may prevent a pregnancy from occurring or continuing.<br>  Infertility differs from sterility. Being sterile means you're unable to conceive a child. With sterility, you or your partner has a physical problem that precludes the ability to conceive. A diagnosis of infertility simply means that becoming pregnant may be a challenge rather than an impossibility.<br>  Signs and symptoms<br>  Most men with fertility problems have no signs or symptoms. Some men with hormonal problems may note a change in their voice or pattern of hair growth, enlargement of their breasts, or difficulty with sexual function. Infertility in women may be signaled by irregular menstrual periods or associated with conditions that cause pain during menstruation or intercourse.<br>  Causes<br>   <br>  The human reproductive process is complex. To accomplish a pregnancy, the intricate processes of ovulation and fertilization need to work just right. For many couples attempting pregnancy, something goes wrong in one or both of these complex processes and causes infertility. Because of the intricate series of events required to begin a pregnancy, many factors may cause a delay in starting your family.<br>  Every month the pituitary gland in a woman's brain sends a signal to her ovaries to prepare an egg for ovulation. The pituitary hormones — follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) — are involved in stimulating the ovaries to bring an egg to ovulation. A large boost in LH carries a message to the ovarian follicle to release its egg (ovulate). A woman is most fertile at the time of ovulation — around day 14 of her menstrual cycle — although the exact time of ovulation varies among women due to different lengths of menstrual cycles.<br>  The egg is then captured by a fallopian tube and is viable for about 24 hours, but its best chance of being fertilized is within the first 12 hours following ovulation. For pregnancy to occur, a sperm must unite with the egg in the fallopian tube during this time. Sperm are capable of fertilizing the egg for up to 72 hours and must be present in the fallopian tube at the same time as the egg for conception to occur. If fertilized, the egg moves into the uterus two to four days later. There it attaches to the uterine lining and begins a nine-month process of growth.<br>  In order for a sperm to reach an egg, many factors are involved in the male fertility process. There must be enough sperm, they must be of the right shape and they must move in the right way. There must be enough semen to transport the sperm. The man also needs to be able to have an erection, and must be able to ejaculate the semen and deliver it into the vagina.<br>  The cause or causes of infertility can involve one or both partners. For many couples having problems with fertility, the male partner is either the sole or a contributing cause. Problems with female fertility are common as well, but present less often than those in the male partner. In both men and women, multiple factors can account for difficulty with fertility. Sometimes the problem isn't really one of infertility, but a more general sexual problem such as erectile dysfunction. Other times, the problem may involve an abnormality in the structure of the reproductive hormones or organs. Certain infections and diseases also can affect fertility.<br>  Causes of male infertility<br>  A number of causes exist for male infertility that may result in impaired sperm count or mobility, or impaired ability to fertilize the egg. The most common causes of male infertility include abnormal sperm production or function, impaired delivery of sperm, conditions related to a man's general health and lifestyle, and overexposure to certain environmental elements:<br>  Abnormal sperm production or function. Most cases of male infertility are due to sperm abnormalities, such as:<br>  ·Impaired shape and movement of sperm. Sperm must be properly shaped and able to move rapidly and accurately toward the egg for fertilization to occur. If the shape and structure (morphology) of the sperm are abnormal or the movement (motility) is impaired, sperm may not be able to reach the egg. <br>  ·Absent sperm production in testicles. Complete failure of the testicles to produce sperm is rare, affecting very few infertile men. <br>  ·Low sperm concentration. A normal sperm concentration is greater than or equal to 20 million sperm per milliliter of semen. A count of 10 million or fewer sperm per milliliter of semen indicates low sperm concentration (subfertility). A count of 40 million sperm or higher per milliliter of semen indicates increased fertility. <br>  ·Varicocele. A varicocele is a varicose vein in the scrotum that may prevent normal cooling of the testicle and raise testicular temperature, preventing sperm from surviving. <br>  ·Undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). This occurs when one or both testicles fail to descend from the abdomen into the scrotum during fetal development. Undescended testicles can cause mild to severely impaired sperm production. Because the testicles are exposed to the higher internal body temperature compared to the temperature in the scrotum, sperm production may be affected. <br>  ·Testosterone deficiency (male hypogonadism). Infertility can result from disorders of the testicles themselves, or an abnormality affecting the hypothalamus or pituitary glands in the brain that produce the hormones that control the testicles. <br>  ·Klinefelter's syndrome. In this disorder of the sex chromosomes, a man has two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome instead of one X and one Y. This causes abnormal development of the testicles, resulting in low or absent sperm production. Testosterone production also may be lower. <br>  ·Infections. Infection may temporarily affect sperm motility. Repeated bouts of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, are most often associated with male infertility. These infections can cause scarring and block sperm passage. Mycoplasma is an organism that may fasten itself to sperm cells, making them less motile. If mumps, a viral infection usually affecting young children, occurs after puberty, inflammation of the testicles can impair sperm production. Inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis), urethra or epididymis also may alter sperm motility. <br>  In many instances, no cause for reduced sperm production is found. When sperm concentration is less than 5 million per milliliter of semen, genetic causes could be involved. A blood test can reveal whether there are subtle changes in the Y chromosome.<br>  Impaired delivery of sperm. Problems with the delivery of sperm from the penis into the vagina can cause infertility. These may include:<br>  ·Sexual issues. Often treatable, problems with sexual intercourse or technique may affect fertility. Difficulties with erection of the penis (erectile dysfunction), premature ejaculation, painful intercourse (dyspareunia), or psychological or relationship problems can contribute to infertility. Use of lubricants such as oils or petroleum jelly can be toxic to sperm and impair fertility. <br>  ·Retrograde ejaculation. This occurs when semen enters the bladder during orgasm rather than emerging out through the penis. Various conditions can cause retrograde ejaculation including diabetes, bladder, prostate or urethral surgery, and the use of psychiatric or antihypertensive drugs. <br>  ·Blockage of epididymis or ejaculatory ducts. Some men are born with blockage of the part of the testicle that contains sperm (epididymis) or ejaculatory ducts. And some men who seek treatment for infertility lack the tubes that carry sperm (vasa deferentia). <br>  ·No semen (ejaculate). The absence of ejaculate may occur in men with spinal cord injuries or diseases. This fluid transports sperm through the penis into the vagina. <br>  ·Misplaced urinary opening (hypospadias). A birth defect can cause the urinary (urethral) opening to be abnormally located on the underside of the penis. If not surgically corrected, this condition can prevent sperm from reaching the cervix. <br>  ·Anti-sperm antibodies. Antibodies that target sperm and weaken or disable them usually occur after surgical blockage of part of the vas deferens for male sterilization (vasectomy). Presence of these antibodies may complicate the reversal of a vasectomy. <br>  ·Cystic fibrosis. Men with cystic fibrosis often have missing or obstructed vasa deferentia. <br>  General health and lifestyle. A man's general health and lifestyle may affect fertility. Some common causes of infertility related to health and lifestyle include:<br>  ·Emotional stress. Stress may interfere with certain hormones needed to produce sperm. Your sperm count may be affected if you experience excessive or prolonged emotional stress. A problem with fertility itself can sometimes become long term and discouraging, producing more stress. Infertility can affect social relationships and sexual functioning. <br>  ·Malnutrition. Deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamin C, selenium, zinc and folate may contribute to infertility. <br>  ·Obesity. Increased body mass may be associated with fertility problems in men. <br>  ·Cancer and its treatment. Both radiation and chemotherapy treatment for cancer can impair sperm production, sometimes severely. The closer radiation treatment is to the testicles, the higher the risk of infertility. Removal of one or both testicles due to cancer also may affect male fertility. You may want to consider freezing (cryopreserving) your sperm before cancer treatment to ensure future fertility. <br>  ·Alcohol and drugs. Alcohol or drug dependency can be associated with general ill health and reduced fertility. The use of certain drugs also can contribute to infertility. Anabolic steroids, for example, which are taken to stimulate muscle strength and growth, can cause the testicles to shrink and sperm production to decrease. <br>  ·Other medical conditions. A severe injury or major surgery can affect male fertility. Certain diseases or conditions, such as diabetes, thyroid disease, HIV/AIDS, Cushing's syndrome, anemia, heart attack, and liver or kidney failure, may be associated with infertility. <br>  ·Age. A gradual decline in fertility is common in men older than 35. <br>  Environmental exposure. Overexposure to certain environmental elements such as heat, toxins and chemicals can reduce sperm count either directly by affecting testicular function or indirectly by altering the male hormonal system. Specific causes include:<br>  ·Pesticides and other chemicals. Herbicides and insecticides may cause female hormone-like effects in the male body and may be associated with reduced sperm production. Exposure to such chemicals also may contribute to testicular cancer. Men exposed to hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene, benzene, toluene, xylen and aromatic solvents used in paint, varnishes, glues, metal degreasers and other products, may be at risk of infertility. Men with high exposure to lead also may be more at risk. <br>  ·Testicular exposure to overheating. Frequent use of saunas or hot tubs can elevate your core body temperature. This may impair your sperm production and lower your sperm count. <br>  ·Substance abuse. Cocaine or heavy marijuana use may temporarily reduce the number and quality of your sperm. <br>  ·Tobacco smoking. Men who smoke may have a lower sperm count than do those who don't smoke. <br>  Causes of female infertility<br>  The most common causes of female infertility include fallopian tube damage or blockage, endometriosis, ovulation disorders, elevated prolactin, polycystic ovary syndrome, early menopause, benign uterine fibroids and pelvic adhesions:<br>  Fallopian tube damage or blockage. This condition usually results from inflammation of the fallopian tube (salpingitis). Chlamydia is the most frequent cause. Tubal inflammation may go unnoticed or cause pain and fever.<br>  Tubal damage with scarring is the major risk factor of a pregnancy in which the fertilized egg is unable to make its way through the fallopian tube to implant in the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). One episode of tubal infection may cause fertility difficulties. The risk of ectopic pregnancy increases with each occurrence of tubal infection.<br>  Endometriosis. Endometriosis occurs when the tissue that makes up the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus. This tissue most commonly is implanted on the ovaries or the lining of the abdomen near the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. These implants respond to the hormonal cycle and grow, shed and bleed in sync with the lining of the uterus each month, which can lead to scarring and inflammation. Pelvic pain and infertility are common in women with endometriosis.<br>  Infertility in endometriosis also may be due to:<br>  ·Ovarian cysts (endometriomas). Ovarian cysts may indicate advanced endometriosis and often are associated with reduced fertility. Endometriomas can be treated with surgery. <br>  ·Scar tissue. Endometriosis may cause rigid webs of scar tissue between the uterus, ovaries and fallopian tubes. This may prevent the transfer of the egg to the fallopian tube. <br>  Ovulation disorders. Some cases of female infertility are caused by ovulation disorders. Disruption in the part of the brain that regulates ovulation (hypothalamic-pituitary axis) can cause deficiencies in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Even slight irregularities in the hormone system can affect ovulation.<br>  Specific causes of hypothalamic-pituitary disorders include:<br>  ·Direct injury to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland <br>  ·Pituitary tumors <br>  ·Excessive exercise <br>  ·Anorexia nervosa <br>  Elevated prolactin (hyperprolactinemia). The hormone prolactin stimulates breast milk production. High levels in women who aren't pregnant or nursing may affect ovulation. An elevation in prolactin levels may also indicate the presence of a pituitary tumor. In addition, some drugs can elevate levels of prolactin. Milk flow not related to pregnancy or nursing (galactorrhea) can be a sign of high prolactin.<br>  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). An increase in androgen hormone production causes PCOS. In women with increased body mass, elevated androgen production may come from stimulation by higher levels of insulin. In lean women, the elevated levels of androgen may be stimulated by a higher ratio of luteinizing hormone (LH). Lack of menstruation (amenorrhea) or infrequent menses (oligomenorrhea) are common symptoms in women with PCOS.<br>  In PCOS, increased androgen production prevents the follicles of the ovaries from producing a mature egg. Small follicles that start to grow but can't mature to ovulation remain within the ovary. A persistent lack of ovulation may lead to mild enlargement of the ovaries.<br>  Without ovulation, the hormone progesterone isn't produced and estrogen levels remain constant. Elevated levels of androgen may cause increased dark or thick hair on the chin, upper lip or lower abdomen as well as acne and oily skin.<br>  Early menopause (premature ovarian failure). Early menopause is the absence of menstruation and the early depletion of ovarian follicles before age 35. Although the cause is often unknown, certain conditions are associated with early menopause, including:<br>  ·Autoimmune disease. The body produces antibodies to attack its own tissue, in this case the ovary. This may be associated with hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone). <br>  ·Radiation or chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer. <br>  ·Tobacco smoking. <br>  Benign uterine fibroids.Fibroids are benign tumors in the wall of the uterus and are common in women in their 30s. Occasionally they may cause infertility by interfering with the contour of the uterine cavity, blocking the fallopian tubes.<br>  Pelvic adhesions. Pelvic adhesions are bands of scar tissue that bind organs after pelvic infection, appendicitis, or abdominal or pelvic surgery. They may limit the functioning of the ovaries and fallopian tubes and impair fertility. Scar tissue formation inside the uterine cavity after a surgical procedure may result in a closed uterus and ceased menstruation (Asherman's syndrome). This is most common following surgery to control uterine bleeding after giving birth.<br>  Other causes. A number of other causes can lead to infertility in women:<br>  ·Medications. Temporary infertility may occur with the use of certain medications. In most cases, fertility is restored when the medication is stopped. <br>  ·Thyroid problems. Disorders of the thyroid gland, either too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) or too little (hypothyroidism), can interrupt the menstrual cycle and cause infertility. <br>  ·Cancer and its treatment. Certain cancers — particularly female reproductive cancers — often severely impair female fertility. Both radiation and chemotherapy may affect a woman's ability to reproduce. Chemotherapy may impair reproductive function and fertility more severely in men than in women. <br>  ·Other medical conditions. Medical conditions associated with delayed puberty or amenorrhea, such as Cushing's disease, sickle cell disease, HIV/AIDS, kidney disease and diabetes, can affect a woman's fertility. <br>  Risk factors<br>  Many of the risk factors for both male and female infertility are the same. They include:<br>  ·Age. Age is the strongest predictor of female fertility. After about age 32, a woman's fertility potential gradually declines. A woman does not renew her oocytes (eggs). Infertility in older women may be due to a higher risk of chromosomal abnormalities that occur in the eggs as they age. Older women are also more likely to have health problems that may interfere with fertility. The risk of miscarriage also increases with a woman's age. A gradual decline in fertility is possible in men older than 35. <br>  ·Tobacco smoking. Women who smoke tobacco may reduce their chances of becoming pregnant and the possible benefit of fertility treatment. Miscarriages are more frequent in women who smoke. <br>  ·Alcohol. There's no certain level of safe alcohol use during conception or pregnancy. <br>  ·Body mass. Extremes in body mass — either too high (body mass index, or BMI, of greater than 25.0) or too low (BMI of lower than 20.0) — may affect ovulation and increase the risk of infertility. <br>  ·Being overweight. Among American women, infertility often is due to a sedentary lifestyle and being overweight. <br>  ·Being underweight. Women at risk include those with eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia, and women following a very low-calorie or restrictive diet. Strict vegetarians also may experience infertility problems due to a lack of important nutrients such as vitamin B-12, zinc, iron and folic acid. Marathon runners, dancers and others who exercise very intensely are more prone to menstrual irregularities and infertility. <br>  When to seek medical advice<br>  In general, don't be concerned about infertility unless you and your partner have been trying regularly to conceive for at least one year. However, if you plan to conceive and you're a woman older than 30 or haven't had a menstrual flow for longer than six months, seek a medical evaluation. If you have a history of irregular or painful menstrual cycles, pelvic pain, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or repeated miscarriages, schedule a consultation with your doctor sooner. If you're a man with a low sperm count or a history of testicular, prostate or sexual problems, consider seeking help earlier.<br>  Screening and diagnosis<br>  If you and your partner are unable to achieve conception within a reasonable time and would like to do so, seek help. The woman's gynecologist, the man's urologist or your family doctor can determine whether there's a problem that requires a specialist or clinic that treats infertility problems.<br>  Some infertile couples have more than one cause of their infertility. Thus, your doctor will usually begin a comprehensive infertility examination of both you and your partner.<br>  Before undergoing infertility testing, be aware that a certain amount of commitment is required. Your doctor or clinic will need to determine what your sexual habits are and may make recommendations about how you may need to change those habits. The tests and periods of trial and error may extend over several months.<br>  Evaluation is expensive and in some cases involves operations and uncomfortable procedures, and the expenses may not be reimbursed by many medical plans. Finally, there's no guarantee, even after all testing and counseling, that conception will occur. However, for couples who are eager to have their own child, such an evaluation is best. It may result in a successful pregnancy.<br>  Tests for men<br>  For a man to be fertile, the testicles must produce enough healthy sperm, and the sperm must be ejaculated effectively into the woman's vagina. Tests for male infertility attempt to determine whether any of these processes are impaired.<br>  ·General physical examination. This includes examination of your genitals and questions concerning your medical history, illnesses and disabilities, medications and sexual habits. <br>  ·Semen analysis. Your doctor may ask for a specimen of ejaculated semen. This is generally obtained by masturbating or by interrupting intercourse and ejaculating your semen into a clean container. Your doctor will provide instructions. Such a specimen may be required more than once. A laboratory analyzes your semen specimen for quantity, color and presence of infections or blood. Detailed analysis of the sperm also is done. The laboratory will determine the number of sperm present and any abnormalities in the shape and movement (motility) of the sperm. Often sperm counts fluctuate from one specimen to the next. <br>  ·Hormone testing. A blood test to determine the level of testosterone and other male hormones is common. <br>  Tests for women<br>  For a woman to be fertile, the ovaries must release healthy eggs regularly, and her reproductive tract must allow the eggs and sperm to pass into her fallopian tubes for a possible union. Her reproductive organs must be healthy and functional.<br>  After your doctor asks questions regarding your health history, menstrual cycle and sexual habits, you'll undergo a general physical examination. This includes a regular gynecologic examination. Specific fertility tests may include:<br>  ·Confirmation of ovulation. A blood test is sometimes performed to determine the levels of hormones involved in successful ovulation. <br>  ·Hysterosalpingography. This test evaluates the condition of your uterus and fallopian tubes. Fluid is injected into your uterus, and an X-ray is taken to determine whether the fluid progresses out of the uterus and into your fallopian tubes and general peritoneal cavity. Blockage or problems often can be located and may be corrected with medication or surgery. <br>  ·Laparoscopy. Performed under general anesthesia, this surgical procedure involves inserting a thin viewing device into your abdomen and pelvis to examine your fallopian tubes, ovaries and uterus. A small incision (8 to 10 millimeters) is made beneath your navel, and a needle is inserted into your abdominal cavity. A small amount of gas (usually carbon dioxide) is inserted into the abdomen to create space for entry of the laparoscope — an illuminated, fiber-optic telescope. <br>  The most common problems identified by laparoscopy are endometriosis and scarring. Your doctor can also detect blockages or irregularities of the fallopian tubes and uterus. Often a blue dye is injected into the cervical canal and through the uterus and fallopian tubes to determine whether they are open. At the end of the procedure, the gas and laparoscope are drawn out and the incision is closed. Laparoscopy generally is done on an outpatient basis.<br>  ·Basal body temperature. Although this test was once a standard, basal body temperature charting is used less often today. Charting a woman's body temperature doesn't give as precise time of ovulation as earlier believed. <br>  ·Urinary luteinizing hormone (LH) detector kits. A number of at-home kits are available to test your LH level. Although these kits may be helpful, they also can be inaccurate and misleading. Consult your doctor before using one. <br>  ·Ovarian reserve testing. Testing may be done to determine the potential effectiveness of the eggs after ovulation. This approach often begins with hormone testing early in a woman's menstrual cycle. <br>  Not everyone needs to undergo all, or even many, of these tests before the cause of infertility is found. Which tests are used and their sequence depend on discussion and agreement between you and your doctor.<br>  Unexplained infertility<br>  In some infertile couples, no specific cause is found (unexplained infertility). Couples receiving the diagnosis of unexplained infertility are more likely to seek multiple health care providers and be influenced by the experiences of family and friends or literature that promises new hope. Although infertility is unexplained, the pregnancy rate for these couples is among the highest.<br>  Complications<br>  Complications of being infertile often involve strong emotions and may trigger negative feelings between you and your partner. These may include:<br>  ·Depression <br>  ·Guilt <br>  ·Anger <br>  ·Stress <br>  ·Disappointment <br>  ·Resentment <br>  ·Blame <br>  ·Fear of losing partner because of infertility <br>  ·Diminished confidence and self-esteem <br>  Treatment <br>  Treatment of infertility depends on the cause, the duration of the problem, the age of the partners and their specific wishes. Some causes of infertility can't be corrected. However, various means of insemination or embryo transfer may be possible so that a woman can still become pregnant.<br>  Nonsurgical fertility treatment falls into two main categories:<br>  ·Restoring or bringing about fertility <br>  ·Assisted reproductive technology (ART) <br>  Restoring or bringing about fertility<br>  These approaches can involve steps related to the male or to the female, or both.<br>  Sperm survive in the female reproductive tract for up to 72 hours, and an egg can be fertilized for up to 24 hours after ovulation. Increasing the frequency of intercourse increases the chances for conception.<br>  Other approaches that involve the male include:<br>  ·Treatment of general sexual problems. Addressing impotence or premature ejaculation can improve fertility. Treatment for these problems often is with medication or behavioral approaches. <br>  ·Addressing lack of sperm. When the source of infertility lies in the man's sperm, or lack of it, restoring or initiating fertility is sometimes possible. For example, in some instances, surgical correction of a varicocele will restore fertility. Problems with the testicles, prostate gland, seminal vesicle and urethra also can be treated. When sperm production is impaired because of damage to the sperm-producing areas of the testicle, drug treatment has little benefit. In rare instances when sperm production is impaired because of a pituitary problem, treatment with pituitary hormones called gonadotropins may help. When infection hampers sperm production, both you and your partner will need treatment. <br>  Fertility drugs (ovulation induction)<br>  Fertility drugs are the primary treatment for women who are infertile due to ovulation disorders. These medications regulate or induce ovulation. In general, they exert actions designed to work like natural follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Commonly used fertility drugs include:<br>  ·Clomiphene citrate (Clomid, Serophene). This drug is taken orally and stimulates ovulation in women who have PCOS or other ovulatory disorders. It causes the pituitary gland to release more FSH and LH, which stimulate the growth of an ovarian follicle containing an egg. <br>  ·Human menopausal gonadotropin, or hMG (Repronex, Pergonal). This injected prescription medication is for women who don't menstruate on their own due to the failure of the pituitary gland to stimulate ovulation. Unlike clomiphene, which stimulates the pituitary gland, hMG and other gonadotropins directly stimulate the ovaries. This drug contains both FSH and LH. <br>  ·Follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH (Gonal-F, Follistim, Bravelle). FSH is essentially hMG without the LH. Like hMG, it works by stimulating the ovaries to mature egg follicles. <br>  ·Human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG (Ovidrel, Pregnyl). Used in combination with clomiphene, hMG and FSH, this drug stimulates the follicle to release its egg (ovulate). <br>  ·Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn-RH) analogs. This treatment is for women with irregular ovulatory cycles or who ovulate prematurely — before the lead follicle is mature enough — during hMG treatment. Gn-RH analogs deliver constant Gn-RH to the pituitary gland, which alters hormone production, so that a physician can induce follicle growth with FSH. <br>  ·Letrozole (Femara). This drug is in a class of medications called aromatase inhibitors, which are approved for treatment of advanced breast cancer. Doctors sometimes prescribe letrozole for women who don't ovulate on their own and who haven't responded to treatment with clomiphene citrate. Letrozole is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for inducing ovulation. The drug's manufacturer has warned doctors not to use the drug for fertility purposes because of possible adverse health effects. These adverse effects may include birth defects and miscarriage. <br>  ·Metformin (Glucophage). This oral drug is taken to boost ovulation. It's used when insulin resistance is known or suspected. <br>  ·Bromocriptine. This medication is for women whose ovulation cycles are irregular due to elevated levels of prolactin, the hormone that stimulates milk production in new mothers. Bromocriptine inhibits prolactin production. <br>  Injectable fertility drugs significantly increase the chance of multiple births. The use of these drugs requires careful monitoring with a combination of blood tests of hormones and ultrasound measurement of ovarian follicle size. Generally, the greater the number of fetuses, the higher the risk of premature labor. Babies born prematurely are at increased risk of health and developmental problems. The risk is greater for triplets than it is for twins or single pregnancies.<br>  The risk of multiple pregnancies can be reduced. If a woman requires an hCG injection to trigger ovulation, and ultrasound exams show that too many follicles have developed, she and her doctor can decide to withhold the hCG injection. For many couples, however, the desire to become pregnant overrides concerns about conceiving multiple babies.<br>  When too many babies are conceived, removal of one or more fetuses (multifetal pregnancy reduction) can offer improved survival odds for the surviving fetuses. This presents serious emotional and ethical challenges for many people. If you and your partner are considering fertility drug treatment, discuss this possibility with your doctor before starting treatment.<br>  There may be a link between fertility drugs and an increased, long-term risk of ovarian cancer. However, the association between fertility drugs and ovarian cancer hasn't been confirmed.<br>  Surgery<br>  Depending on the cause, surgery may be a treatment option for infertility. Blockages or other problems in the fallopian tubes usually can be surgically repaired. Laparoscopy allows delicate operations on the fallopian tubes.<br>  Infertility due to endometriosis often is more difficult to treat. Although hormones such as those found in birth control pills are effective for treating endometriosis and relieving pain, they haven't been useful in treating infertility. If you have endometriosis, your doctor may treat you with ovulation therapy, in which medication is used to stimulate or regulate ovulation, or in vitro fertilization, in which the egg and sperm are joined in the laboratory and transferred to the uterus.<br>  Assisted reproductive technology (ART)<br>  ART has revolutionized the treatment of infertility. Each year thousands of babies are born in the United States as a result of ART. Medical advances have enabled many couples to have their own biological child. An ART health team includes physicians, psychologists, embryologists, laboratory technicians, nurses and allied health professionals who work together to help infertile couples achieve pregnancy.<br>  The most common forms of ART include:<br>  ·In vitro fertilization (IVF). This is the most effective ART technique. IVF involves retrieving mature eggs from a woman, fertilizing them with a man's sperm in a dish in a laboratory and implanting the embryos in the uterus three to five days after fertilization. IVF often is recommended as a first-line therapy and is the treatment of choice if both fallopian tubes are blocked. It's also widely used for a number of other conditions, such as endometriosis, unexplained infertility, cervical factor infertility, male factor infertility and ovulation disorders. <br>  ·Electroejaculation. Electric stimulus brings about ejaculation to obtain semen. This procedure can be used in men with a spinal cord injury who can't otherwise achieve ejaculation. <br>  ·Surgical sperm aspiration. This technique involves removing sperm from part of the male reproductive tract such as the epididymis, vas deferens or testicle. This allows retrieval of sperm if blockage is present. <br>  ·Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). This technique consists of a microscopic technique (micromanipulation) in which a single sperm is injected directly into an egg to achieve fertilization in conjunction with the standard IVF procedure. ICSI has been especially helpful in couples who have previously failed to achieve conception with standard techniques. For men with low sperm concentrations, ICSI dramatically improves the likelihood of fertilization. <br>  ·Assisted hatching. This technique attempts to assist the implantation of the embryo into the lining of the uterus. <br>  ART works best when the woman has a healthy uterus, responds well to fertility drugs, and ovulates naturally or uses donor eggs. The man should have healthy sperm, or donor sperm should be available. The success rate of ART gradually diminishes after age 32.<br>  Complications of treatment<br>  Certain complications exist with the treatment of infertility. These include:<br>  ·Multiple pregnancy. Although the most common complication of ART is multiple pregnancy, ART isn't the direct cause of a number of the extreme cases of septuplets or octuplets reported in the media. The number of quality embryos kept and matured to fetuses and birth ultimately is a decision made by the couple. If too many babies are conceived, the removal of one or more fetuses (multifetal pregnancy reduction) is possible to improve survival odds for the other fetuses. <br>  ·Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). If overstimulated, a woman's ovaries may enlarge and cause pain and bloating. Mild to moderate symptoms often resolve without treatment, although pregnancy may delay recovery. Rarely, fluid accumulates in the abdominal cavity and chest, causing abdominal swelling and shortness of breath. This accumulation of fluid can deplete blood volume and lower blood pressure. Severe cases require emergency treatment. Younger women and those who have polycystic ovary syndrome have a higher risk of developing OHSS than do other women. <br>  ·Bleeding or infection. As with any invasive procedure, there is a risk of bleeding or infection. <br>  ·Low birth weight. The greatest risk for low birth weight is a multiple pregnancy. In single live births, there may be a greater chance of low birth weight associated with ART. <br>  ·Birth defects. Significant concern exists regarding the possible relationship between ART and birth defects. More research is necessary to confirm these findings. Weigh this factor if you're considering whether to take advantage of this treatment. ART is the most successful fertility-enhancing therapy to date. <br>  Prevention<br>  Most types of male infertility aren't preventable. However, avoid drug and tobacco use and excessive alcohol consumption, which may contribute to male infertility. Also, high temperatures can affect sperm production and motility. Although this effect is usually temporary, avoid hot tubs and steam baths.<br>  If you're a man who's uncertain about whether you would eventually like to become a father, don't undergo permanent sterilization, such as a vasectomy. Although surgery to reverse this condition is possible, risks are involved that could affect fertility in other ways.<br>  A woman can increase her chances of becoming pregnant in a number of ways:<br>  ·Exercise moderately. Regular exercise is important, but if you're exercising so intensely that your periods are infrequent or absent, your fertility is likely to be impaired. <br>  ·Avoid weight extremes. Being overweight or underweight can affect your hormone production and cause infertility. <br>  ·Avoid alcohol, tobacco and street drugs. These substances may impair your ability to conceive or produce a healthy child. Don't drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. Avoid illegal drugs such as marijuana and cocaine. <br>  ·Limit medications. The use of both prescription and nonprescription drugs can decrease your chance of getting pregnant or keeping a pregnancy. Talk with your doctor about any medications you take regularly. <br>  Coping skills<br>  Coping with infertility can be difficult. It's an issue of the unknown — you can't predict how long it will last or what the outcome will be. Infertility isn't necessarily solved with hard work. The emotional burden on a couple is considerable, and plans for coping can help.<br>  Planning for emotional turmoil<br>  ·Set limits. Decide in advance how many and what kind of procedures are emotionally and financially acceptable for you and your partner and attempt to determine a final limit. Fertility treatments may be expensive and often not covered by insurance companies, and a successful pregnancy often depends on repeated attempts. Some couples become so focused on treatment that they continue with fertility procedures until they are emotionally and financially drained. <br>  ·Consider other options. Determine alternatives — adoption, donor sperm or egg, or even having no children — as early as possible in the fertility process. This can reduce anxiety during treatments and feelings of hopelessness if conception doesn't occur. <br>  ·Talk about your feelings. Locate support groups or counseling services for help before and after treatment to help endure the process and ease the grief should treatment fail. <br>  Managing emotional stress during treatment<br>  ·Acupuncture. This ancient therapy may benefit couples who are undergoing fertility treatment. <br>  ·Practice relaxation. Cognitive behavior therapy, which uses methods that include relaxation training and stress management, has been associated with higher pregnancy rates. <br>  ·Express yourself. Reach out to others rather than repressing guilt or anger. <br>  ·Stay in touch with loved ones. Talking to your partner, family and friends can be very beneficial. The best support often comes from loved ones and those closest to you. <br>  Managing emotional effects of the outcome<br>  ·Failure. The emotional stress of failure can be devastating even on the most loving and affectionate relationships and for people who've prepared well for the possibility of failure. Don't hesitate to seek professional help if the emotional burdens become too heavy for you or your partner. <br>  ·Success. Some studies have indicated that even if fertility treatment is successful, women experience increased stress and fear of failure during pregnancy. Other research suggests that women who achieved pregnancy using fertility treatments felt increasingly better and had higher self-esteem and less anxiety as the pregnancy progressed than did women whose pregnancies didn't involve medical intervention. <br>  ·Multiple births. A successful pregnancy that results in multiple births introduces new complexities and emotional problems. The risk of depression is higher in women who have multiple births. <br>  ·Parenting. Once a child arrives, parents are more likely to be more anxious and have less confidence and self-esteem. Discuss becoming parents with your partner and plan for the many changes — challenging and rewarding — that a child will bring to your lives. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  By Mayo Clinic Staff <br>  Jun 15, 2006 <br>  ? 1998-2006 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	Most doctors won't give you a HCG test until the woman has missed her period for a few days. Wait until a few days before her period is due and do a home pregnancy test.|`|AA11853330	When I say so....that's when!|`|820a73cf560f113ec7b4b70fb5270d0baa	2-3 weeks after conception
fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	I have felt your pain. I was ttc for 3 1/2 years. In those 3 ++ years, my best friend (twice), my sister-in-law, my neighbor, 4 cousins, and 3 co-workers got pregnant. It was the most trying time of my life.<br>  <br>  It is very difficult to deal with. Let yourself be jealous and angry at those women. At least for a little while and never to them personally. For me, I found that knowing the reason behind my infertility made it a little bit easier. As each month progressed, I told myself that it would happen for me someday. And if it didn't, I would adopt. <br>  <br>  The pain never goes away. But it gets easier each day. Good Luck!!!|`|AA11226053	My sister in law was on ovulex for years & was never able to concieve.  They are now in the process of adoption.  I know it can be hard to see other women getting pregnant, I am 6 weeks , haven't told my sister in law yet, I don't want her to be sad.  Make sure sex has not become a "job" if you & your hubby have made it into a "baby making job" it will put both bodies under stress which make it harder to concieve.  Spice things up a bit in the bedroom & take the "work" out of it & you will be much more likely to concieve.  Good LucK|`|1e5562d67124e0cd53f3abd1cb430305aa	I feel your pain.  I have been TTC for over 2 years.  One woman in my office just got pregnant recently.  I am now the only one in the office that doesn't have kids.  It's just one of those things that you seem to notice when you want something so bad.  Like when I was getting married, I swear everything on TV was about getting married...now it is all about babies.  Just know that you are not alone.  I know there is nothing that can be said to make you feel better.  It is just a process.  But if you ever want to just vent and b**** about it all feel free to email me any time!  Hang in there.|`|12ff189fd9592d68b6e835983a776374aa	iI have been TTC for 4 years...I have also tried Ovulex, nothing works for me...I haven’t see a doctor yet, but I have made the appointment...<br>  <br>  go get checked out, u and ur hubby. If there is a problem, they might be able to help. If not, there is always adoption. I have even thought of a sperm donor (thinking it was my hubby's problem, not mine)<br>  <br>  for me, it is so hard to see my friends on there 2nd baby and I cant even have one yet...every time I see someone pregnant, I wanna cry because I ask, why am I not able to have a child of my own...I guess there is a reason for everything...<br>  <br>  just keep your head up and remember, there is hope, just have faith and one day your dreams will be answered...<br>  <br>  I wish you all the luck in the world!!!|`|1e8c3af12a65dc5ae2042a2ddea41303aa	It's a strange thing conception is. I have heard of people who decided after months of unsuccessful TTCing to not try so hard or to dwell on it. They miraculously become pregnant. I also know of a couple who TTC'd for years and then decided to adopt. They adopted a child..and ended up pregnant!! I think if you dwell on it (and it's hard not too) then you end up somehow preventing it from happening. Goos Luck to you. I know it's hard. I'm 31 and have been TTC #1. I get frustrated but I have decided to try and relax and not worry so much about it. Your in my prayers ~ BabyDust To You ~=)|`|d9336dc88efe39b9aaee97a52726ef0aaa	Have you seen a Dr about possible infertility problems? They say if your under 35 you should try for 12 months and if you do not get pregnant you should see a Dr about possible infertility, If you are over 35 They only want you to try for 6 months before seeing a Dr. I know no one wants to think about possible infertility, but it happens alot. I wish you the Best of Luck in getting your baby, I know how bad the struggle can be!!|`|2057ad1d225cf4439a1602ba7e6617a1aa	YOu should look into taking what GOD and not Dr.s put here.

We hadn't been actively 'trying' because the whole thing was kind of disappointing and sad.  My doctor does think the recent miscarriage was totally unrelated to the abortion.  <br>  <br>  I'm ready to try again though, so I'm charting temperatures and such this month.  So, I'm not a mother yet but I hope to be one soon.

fdd575f390b4be47ff15be129acaf5c9aa	People there is this wonderful place called Planned Parenthood. Good grief use birth control, condoms, why are so many people on here talking of either abortions or "Duh I think I am pregnant what do I do now" Grow up if your going to sleep around get your tubes tied if your going to be this dumb. Of course you can get pregnant if he didn't ejaculate. Sperm are pretty tough they can live in a woman for 3-5 days waiting to get to the egg. God I hope your not pregnant.|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Just because he didn't ejactulate doesn't mean there weren't sperm in his pre-ejaculate.|`|AA11226053	False negatives are pretty common take another test and pre c*m can get you pregnant too, "pull out method " is more like I am going to get ya pregnant method.|`|35b556c2173bffe1d4fbb6eb6496abe5aa	no|`|3859397ae5611a903ea1db7bf3880194aa	To become 'pregnant' even touch is possible, intercourse has a lot of probability, as many spams comes out during initial contact.<br>  SO, wait and pray, next time don't take a risk!|`|6eee23ed11c9a0f8ed2477f2743e99a2aa	You are not due yet; be patient.

Men pre-ejaculate all the time without ever climaxing, so if you are using the pullout method, you are running a HUGE risk!  Have you ever given him a hand job and seen the pre-ejac?  There is enough sperm in that little bitty bit to impregnate 200 women!  You need to be using protection anyway because whether you are pregnant or not should not be your biggest fear!

There is sperm in pre-ejaculatory semen, it is possible to get pregnant by just a little semen leaking out right before he ejaculates.  Do not ever use the "pull out" method as a means of birth control.  It is like playing with fire.  Wrap that bad boy  up in a condom............it will also help prevent STD's.|`|e84b515e95643d87b8a823bdf30ed9f5aa	Men secrete lubrication in which there may be traces of sperm.  It is not necessary for ejaculation to occur to become pregnant.  Though moderately accurate, home pregnancy tests are not one-hundred percent.  The only definative answer would be to see your physician.  Next time, wrap it up.

948155d01620c2579b670ab4c3f0c58aaa	My sis is the breadwinner in her family. When she went back to work after having their son, she used a double breast pump (to save time) and froze the milk. You could skip the nursing and just do the pumping. You just have to work at getting your milk production into schedule that works for you. Breast milk is suppose to be beneficial for the babies immune system. There are many websites offering great info on breastfeeding. <br>  LaLecheLeague<br>  <a href="http://www.lalecheleague.org/nb.html?m=0,0,0" rel="nofollow">http://www.lalecheleague.org/nb.html?m=0...</a><br>  Breastfeeding.com<br>  <a href="http://www.breastfeeding.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.breastfeeding.com/</a>|`|33ca3bbc19537387c11acf6a42878d24aa	I didn't start pumping until after the baby was born. Yes, you do freeze it because it is important.<br>  <br>  Just because you work long hours doesn't mean you can't breastfeed. You pump out the milk, freeze it, and when bf is home taking care of the baby, he can thaw it. OR you can breastfeed when you get home and bf can formula feed. Either way, try to breasfeed your baby. It will be good for him/her and you.|`|5593c4b3c7737cd837591ad71bc249f5aa	LE LECHE LEAGUE!!!! CONTACT THEM, THEY HAVE SO MUCH INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP YOU!!!<br>  <br>  YOU CAN DO IT. JUST GET YOURSELF SOME INFO!!! <br>  <br>  CONGRATS!|`|f16c217f54de3f78bc78b89d235b3a58aa	I strictly pumped breast milk for my son, and plan on doing it again with the baby I am currently pregnant with. I would take some time out each day and pump, then freeze what wouldn't be used right away (I think it lasts up to 3 months if it's frozen). By pumping, my son still had to breastmilk, which many say is better for the baby, not to mention cheaper than buying formula, and then I could have his father feed him in the middle of the night, too. We could take bottles of breastmilk out with us wherever we went, either of us could feed the baby, and we don't have to worry too much. I highly recommend it.|`|011552918d0b198dffaf42fff2d8e497aa	Oh girl you can still breast feed and work! Whoever told you to freeze it was very smart. Go get a breast pump and pump the colostrum out after the baby is born, put it in the breast milk baggies, date it and freeze it. That way your husband can feed the baby when you are working! That way you don't have to worry about the hassle of formula and all, and in all honesty (and I'm not a boob nazi people so don't go there), breast milk is better for the baby!<br>  <br>  Hmmm, go to www.kellymom.com <-- it has GREAT resources on breast feeding and pumping and storing the milk. You will do great girl, you will be a good mom! Good luck with your baby!|`|14ec66f92174ba2893907e683e1e1bdeaa	Get a breast pump. It will come in handy. Breast milk is much healthier than formula. But only start pumping when the baby is born. You don't want your baby to come early. Congrats to you and your new baby!|`|7e667dc8a9e77bbee64d9ee48a2ed07caa	If you are not going to breastfeed, then you shouldnt bother. Also, even though you may hear breast feeding is best... not always true. My son was not breastfed and he is healthier than many i know who were breastfed. your decision hun. but you cant start then stop.. make the choice soon|`|AA10049270	You can get a pump ...double electric pump is best. However You shouldnt pump at 6 months pregnant. The stimulation releases the same hormone as is released during labor. So it could cause you to go into labor. You don't want that to happen this early. I have heard dr's say 2 weeks to 1 month before delivery is ok to start pumping. The breastmilk should be frozen after you start pumping. Good luck with your baby!|`|AA11177857	Of course there is... its called a breastpump girl.  Very Handy, and yes, I started pumping about a month or two before I delivered ( I was 38 weeks).  Breastmilk is the best thing for them... and let me tell you, you will be lactating after your pregnant too, so instead of letting it go to waste pump it, give it to your boyfriend to feed your baby! And breast milk lasts 6 months frozen, and 2 weeks in the fridge... Hope that this helped!|`|617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	Well, the "premilk" is called colostrum.  It's packed with nutrients your baby needs when it's born.  I've heard of freezing milk but I have no idea how long it lasts.  Ask your doctor about that one.<br>  <br>  Sure your husband can feed the baby; buy a breast pump.  They attach to your breasts and are basically the same thing as the sleeves farmers use to milk cows.  The machine sucks out milk, you bottle it, refrigerate it, and your husband warms it to feed the baby from the bottle.|`|AA11226053	The "first stuff" was colustrum, & your body will again produce it once the baby is born (your hormones will make it) At only 6 months I would not be pumping & saving.

fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	You can expect to be there quite a while. You and your partner will be expected to give a complete medical history including your family history. He will be asked to give a sperm sample. She can expect a full physical exam, including weight, blood pressure and blood work. They will also do an internal ultrasound to determine that the proper organs are there and appear to be healthy. <br>  <br>  You will most likely not get an answer to your infertility question in the first visit.

Fc5et3Wraa	I just heard on the news a few days ago that you should NEVER give children under 2 years of age cold medicine unless you ask your doctor.  Apparently, the majority of cold medicines out on the market have only been tested on adults and have not even been tested on kids....they have just adjusted the dosage.  And, kids are getting sick from cold medicine due to this.  A cold is a virus and will go away on its own...it's best not to give a cold medicine as it will slow down the process of them trying to shed the virus.

a6ff5d97c61f7c51704a7ea5d13defd7aa	As a 34 year old sperm donor with a high quality sperm I would recommend your this:<br>  <br>  To do list<br>  <br>  1.Eat as organic as possible, but let it taste good.<br>  2.Use daily organic fresh parsley, garlic, turmeric and ginger as seasoning.<br>  3.Have some daily servings a fresh organic fruits.<br>  4.Eat calf’s liver and celery once a week.<br>  5.Get Zinc, vitamin E, selenium straight from your food, not via supplements. This site is a good tool for that <a href="http://whfoods.org/nutrientstoc.php..." rel="nofollow">http://whfoods.org/nutrientstoc.php...</a><br>  6.Be patient sperm take about 3 month to form.<br>  7.Ejaculate regularly, ideal every 2-3 days. That’ll eliminate the old & dead, leave time for the youngest to mature and keeps your production rate steady.<br>  8.Keep cool. Wash yourself with water of 30°C or lower and before leaving the shower give your testies a cold minute. <br>  9.Wear boxers under loose pants.<br>  10.Move, exercise, live actively take a stair instead of elevators, but gently don’t overheat yourself.<br>  11.Drink 1 or 2 liter of water a day.<br>  12.Eventually take same organic ginseng and or maca. Just 1 spoon or tablet a day everyday is enough, like 1 fresh orange a day every day is much more efficient then having lots every now and then.<br>  <br>  But remember their quality effect will only come through after 3 months and if you do some of the bellow it’s useless as you take one step forward and one back.<br>  <br>  Not to do list<br>  <br>  1.Absolutely no smoking.<br>  2.Avoid hazardous fumes as paints and car exhaust.<br>  3.Avoid heat, hot tubs, sauna’s and even use a cool pack when having a fever.<br>  4.No junk food.<br>  5.Avoid food supplements, save the money to get quality food.<br>  6.Do not bike, cycling isn’t good at all.<br>  7.Don’t over-or under perform sexually.<br>  8.Try to limit alcohol use, but a glass (1!) while eating is alright<br>  <br>  After 3 months you ought to have an improved spermcount. If you're trying to conceive then save your sperm for 3 to 5 days. As sperm survive a couple of days in the womb take 2 shots. Save up the maximum for 5 days and give it to your partner 2-3 days before the ovulation peak and after recharging for 3 days again.<br>  <br>  Studies on the offspring of victims of the Irish famine shows that poor nutrition quality can not only affect children but also grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

You shouldn't be handling feces from your pets anyways while you are pregnant.  Some people do it and they are just fine, but I wouldn't and don't take the risk.  good luck.  I know exactly what you mean by smells only you can smell.  It gets kind of annoying.  =)  Hang in there, it'll get better!|`|AA10850480	It's just a pregnant thing, I'm still cleaning my house every other day because a smell or a speck of dust will drive me into a cleaning frenzy.

fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	1) It is possible to get pregnant with your husband's low sperm count. You could opt for Intra-Uterine Insemination (IUI). Or your husband could have a procedure to open up his tubes to increase his sperm count. (A friend of mine did that and they were pregnant within three months) But I hope that you are on Clomid not him! 2) Clomid can help you ovulate more than one egg for his sperm to fertilize so it could help 3 & 4) you can't tell if your are pregnant only 4 days post ovulation. You are going to have to wait until you miss your period. Sorry but hope this helps!!|`|36f28b0e1802b9799c711d2fffd5fcd2aa	1) Yes You Can But It Might Take A While.<br>  <br>  2) Clomid Helps Produce More So It Works But Not 100% Effective<br>  <br>  3)Can't tell At Fourth Day After<br>  <br>  4) By Blood Test You Can tell A week Before Your Period HPTs Are A Different Story, They Are Not Always Accurate Early, You SHOULD Wait On Those Until After You Miss Your Period.
c1cdb0d85b4d4e65dc07007c4e1cd7fbaa	Well, um...the PCO part would indicate that you would have cysts on your ovaries, but I've seen ultrasounds of my ovaries where I had a TON of cysts, then there weren't many at all.  In fact, last time I got checked out only one ovary had the cysts.<br>  <br>  PCOS is still in the process of being figured out...from what I've read, there isn't one definitive cause, and they haven't figured out every facet of the disease.  The more research I read, the more complex it sounds!  <br>  <br>  I would imagine that with or without cysts, there must be enough of the other classic signs to make a diagnosis (excess weight around the abdomen, excess body hair, acne, etc).  If you're still not comforted, you might want to look for a second opinion.|`|3d2ce97de1749800c610af8df29fe8b3aa	HEY HEY :-D<br>  <br>  I have PCOS... I have NO cysts!!! Ive been seeing my specialist for 2 yrs now... I have certain hormones that are out of wack and although i dont have the cysts.. I HAVE IT.. My doctor says that there are many different types of PCOS and you DO NOT have to have the cysts... It does sound silly.. but its the truth<br>  <br>  After being on different medications and losing all my weight.. im apperently getting better...   so ignore these other ppl :P come have a look at my doctor certificates :P|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Yes, I do. Get more information from your gynecologist.|`|617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	Technically, no.<br>  <br>  PCOS stands for PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome.  So if she does not have cysts on her ovaries, she doesn't fit the diagnosis.<br>  <br>  However, if she displayed all the other symptoms, she would probably be treated in the same way.  Aside from the removal of cysts, any medicines or treatment given to someone with PCOS to jump-start ovulation, regulate or lesson menstruation, etc, would probably also help her.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, the doctor would treat her the same way but she would not be diagnosed as having PCOS.  Her medical records would say something like "displays many symptoms of PCOS/no cysts on ovaries".  It would NOT say that she has PCOS.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, many women who do NOT have PCOS have cysts on their ovaries at one time or another.  You can't be diagnosed with something that doesn't fit.  They don't have multiple cysts or exhibit the other symptoms.

That's why most pregnancies result from fertilization by sperm that have been waiting in a woman's reproductive tract days before the release of her egg — ovulation — takes place.<br>  <br>  Outside the body — where they're not being nourished and protected by a woman's cervical mucus and vaginal secretions, or the warmth and moisture of a man's urethra and reproductive tract — sperm die anywhere between a half an hour to four hours after being ejaculated. If the ejaculate has dried out, or has been wiped or washed off, there are no longer any living sperm to worry about.<br>  <br>  Hope this information helps!|`|617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	It can live up to five days.<br>  <br>  I don't have a medical background, but have been trying to conceive for nearly a year.<br>  <br>  In lots of research, that's the longest I've heard.  Some of the weaker ones will die within 24 hours though.<br>  <br>  It's safe to assume that they will start dying off within a few hours, becoming fewer and fewer in number until 5 days later, when all should definitely be dead.

AA11713121	Well the cervical fluid tends to dry up pretty quickly after ovulation so if it hasn't yet I'd say you still have a good chance.<br>  <br>  Eggwhite cervical fluid is the most fertile and if you are seeing that then I'd say you are at your most fertile right now.|`|617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	If it's still like egg white, the egg is still alive.<br>  <br>  You can try tonight.|`|35a46c40a75ba25c0ce9608315c0e0fbaa	Yes you still have a chance as long as your cervical fluid is still egg white like.

f0503b7c948aabdd21ad5f5ddaca7e86aa	I know I am going to get thumbs down for this, but depending on all the methods you have tried, ie, time out, taking favorite toys away, etc.  We have a 3 year old in our family who doesn't listen to a thing we are saying. We actually thought he had some kind of a hearing problem until my Mother stepped into the picture and started babysitting him for a couple of weeks because he was having to switch daycares. During this time my Mother would get a little switch off a tree and pop him on the leg when he wouldn't listen.  Now, when he still isn't listening, we don't have to switch him, all we have to do is say "Ok, let me get the switch so Ryan will listen!" and all the sudden he can hear you and he does exactly what you want him to.  We have many many children in our family and this is the only one we have had to do this with. All of us have just used time out and taking toys away as punishment and it has always worked for them, but not for Ryan.  Before I had to switch him, I went to the bathroom and switched my leg first to make sure I wasn't going to hurt him. It just had a tiny sting to it.  Ok, I'm ready for judgment!!  :-)|`|0edf5d63b5bdecd9cfe1e658ae61a4a0aa	Ahhhh the "tyrant 3's". There is no right or wrong strategy. Every child is unique and what works for one, doesn't for the next. Whatever or however you choose to deal with him, be consistent. No means no every time, not just now and then. At 3 he should have the ability to understand "time out" and will hate being confined, but it works with some kids. Good luck to you.|`|39e92f6342252994a40c04b1fb383e9daa	This is the time where children like to test their boundaries.  Just set guidelines and stick with them!!!  Mine always "fight the law" and they learned real quick that "the law wins"!!  Parents.com is a great website and magazine for parents.  There's also a forum if you want to get insight on other parents.

Its very effective and Ive been doing it less often. Good luck.|`|44005f65ae5a530f0ab0e8660f2f4fc4aa	Ya know your little guy is testing the boundaries....Seeing how far he can push you. There is nothing wrong with putting him in the corner-or time out for three minutes if that don't work there is nothing wrong with a good old-fashioned spanking (after which you tell him that you love him and the only reason he got spanked is because you don't want him to be naughty-you want him to be good and listen.)  Or you can make him fold the clothes and put them away-Don't be picky about how messy they look-Don't refold in front of him- Make him know that it is his punishment<br>  <br>  P.S. Two or three spats on the bottom is enough.|`|a99b5aae436d66d2b3309101cf47c2c4aa	It's a stage..... Don't worry about it too much even though it is frusterating! Have a talk with him saying it makes you feel really mad or sad when he does this behavior he will listen! Also another way is have a box and if he is bad or not listening tell him to put a toy in the box and when he is good and when he did something you asked him to do you give him one toy back! My nieces and nephews are doing this and it works great! Good Luck!|`|ab56668d0a7c7f310134277ec98f9488aa	I have 3 children ages 2,7, and 9. My first two were no trouble. This last one is always disobeying. I would try to use time out. But you must be strict about it. If he gets out you must make him go back in until he stays for 3 mins. straight. If this does not work, I suggest a spanking. Let him know why he is getting it, and that if he misbehaves he will get it again. I know spanking may sound harsh, but sometimes it is the only resort.|`|301b8e82bcf240fb15852e2d4f50b0a3aa	At 3 years old they will be really doing things the other way. Well, I can get you some help.<br>  <br>  As yours is a Son, they are the most mischief makers at these times. Let your son play in a separate place that you have made for him and where all sorts of play things are available and he is comfortable with it. During the development stage it's really imporant that you let the child to move around more often rather than making him sit in one place. This will initiate him brain development phase. When you have given enough playthings and let him in, he would play until he gets tired. And as times goes he will automatically reduce to do such things and will complete stop these mischief within 6 months if you properly planned his environment.<br>  <br>  Let them do anything inside their territory. Even inks and plastic toys can help them great.<br>  <br>  BYE|`|aa29a8193be1f6d602839ae0c7c38c2aaa	he sounds like a normal three year old to me (smile) . im sure you are frustrated. as the mother of four grown children and 13 grandchildren i have been through that alot! lol the best thing is patience.  also you can have him pick up the clothes and help you put them back in the drawer and then say. thank you for helping mommy! see how nice it looks. lets keep them in the drawer so  it will be nice all of the time. often when they help you and get praise they want to get more praise. this helps them see what they are doing to get positive responses from you. i never realized this method worked until my children  were all grown. i think we are so busy when we are younger and raising children we dont see how patience and calm  gets the best results. i hope this works for you. hagd and good luck. enjoy your little one, he sounds like a cuttie!!!!!

617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	The test that they do to determine whether your tubes are blocked is very reliable.  Your tubes probably are blocked, as the results showed.<br>  <br>  Your tubes could be blocked by lots of things.  Having an abortion, having a miscarriage, having light periods, having cysts on any of your reproductive organs, etc.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if you doctor refuses to treat this after those test results, I'd get another doctor.  All your tests are fine?  No, they're not.  Your tubes are blocked and need to be cleared.  Wait two months?  What good will that do?  <br>  <br>  It is possible for tubes to clear on their own; I had one blocked tube at one point and it cleared without treatment.  But if you've already been trying for a YEAR and BOTH are blocked, she should be treating you right away.<br>  <br>  Find another doctor and tell them you want it treated right now.  Once this is fixed it will probably be much easier for you to conceive.<br>  <br>  The doctor didn't hurt you on purpose during the test.  It is painful to begin with, and if your tubes are blocked the pain can last a long time.  I still say find a new doctor.|`|AA10287238	Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? Some of those can cause scarring and blockage in your tubes if they aren't treated right away. Did you have a hysterosalpingography done to get your diagnosis? You could also just have a buildup of fluid in your tubes. Just make sure whoever does your surgery is experienced. Good luck!|`|f06856fe1103a8505019208373978a19aa	what ever happens please don't count out adoption, if you really love babies.

8772610b9c29b57a40662e6c7a369ddfaa	06/12/2006<br>  <br>  Las patologías tiroideas afectan la fertilidad<br>  <br>  Una investigadora del Conicet encontró que las disfunciones de esta glándula pueden ser causales de infertilidad. Relativamente frecuentes en mujeres de edad reproductiva, estas patologías pueden ser graves para la madre y el embrión. Cómo deben prevenirse las mujeres<br>  <br>  <br>  Así como el hiper o el hipotiroidismo afectan el equilibrio hormonal durante la gestación y la lactancia y tienen efectos negativos en el crecimiento de los neonatos, las disfunciones en esta glándula también producen una disminución en la fertilidad de la mujer.<br>  <br>  Al menos así resalta la bioquímica Graciela Jahn, una investigadora del Conicet en el Cricyt, que recomienda un chequeo en este sentido si no se encuentra una causa aparente de infertilidad.<br>  <br>  "Igualmente no son las causas más comunes de infertilidad y lo más probable es que la mujer vaya a la consulta médica por los síntomas metabólicos específicos del hiper o hipotiroidismo", aclara la especialista, convencida de la necesidad de concretar un chequeo del estado tiroideo que se realiza con análisis simples tiroxina libre, tiroxina total y TSH circulantes, especialmente ante la falta de precisión en un caso de falta de concepción.<br>  <br>  <br>  Casos leves y casos severos<br>  <br>  Si bien es cierto que pueden producir ciclos anovulatorios y eventualmente amenorrea, la facilidad con las que se pueden tratar, hace que los problemas tiroideos no se manifiesten en su fase más severa.<br>  <br>  "El hipertiroidismo leve se puede agravar durante el primer trimestre (después se atenúa) y el hipotiroidismo se agrava al final del embarazo, pero tanto el hiper como el hipotiroidismo subclínicos pueden declararse durante todo el embarazo" advierte la doctora Jahn.<br>  <br>  En el caso del hipotiroidismo, el riesgo más grave es el aborto y aun el hipotiroidismo subclínico tiene un riesgo altísimo de aborto durante el primer trimestre. "Igual que para los casos de infertilidad sin causa aparente, en los casos de abortos espontáneos recurrentes habría que hacer el estudio del estado tiroideo de la paciente para descartar un hipotiroidismo", continuó.<br>  <br>  para mas info lee de la fuente:|`|28ea9c37e0c6ee73764320304d6aa58caa	relacion... no se, no soy medico, pero tengo hipotiroidismo. nunca le pregunte a mi doctora al respecto, pero espero que no tenga ada que ver...<br>  quiero tener hijos!!!!<br>  suerte!<br>  <br>  gracias Sigrid por aliento que nos das!!!|`|462e6d51c98e52db013924ee4ddc013aaa	y lo mas seguro es k esta ligado a lo hormonal para k una mujer sea fertil o normalmente fertil deve de tener un minimo de hormonas y esta enfermedad aveces las dispara o las disminuye|`|9bbdb9c5c6ad59824b929b6caf90f60eaa	Busquè este articulo que te puede servir tiene muchas palabras medicas que tal vez no entiendas pero si lees con detenimiento encontraras la respuesta a lo que buscas. <br>  Lo que si se sabe que el embarazo en el hipotiroidismo es infrecuente. espero te sirva<br>  <br>  <a href="http://escuela.med.puc.cl/publ/boletin/Tiroidea/FuncionTiroideaCiclo.html" rel="nofollow">http://escuela.med.puc.cl/publ/boletin/T...</a>

AA10317675	My brother had four kids, two with autism.  We we all love all the kids, I would not recommend it.  Of course, that depends on the development of the child.  My niece is 10 & can't yet speak.  If my niece had Asperger's (could talk well, etc.) it would be much less difficult to have a second child with that condition.  Of course, just because one child has a mild form of autism, doesn't rule out a chance of having another child with more severe autism.<br>  <br>  If a couple has the genetic make up for autism to be poss. as you two apparently do, the odds of another child being autistic goes up to 4 out of a hundred.<br>  <br>  A recent study suggests the age of the father is a significant factor in the risk of a child becoming autistic.  The odds are almost doubled after age 35, quadrupled after age 40.  (My brother's first autistic child was born when he was 36, his second born when he was 41).<br>  <br>  -----<br>  <br>  I would be curious to hear what kind of genetic testing your Dr. did to determine your chances of having another autistic child were slim, considering I never heard there was any concensus on which genes cause autism.|`|885c2a04e3d4e24e2d0a600e73d230f2aa	i work with kids on the spectrum, and lots of our parents only have the one kid.

I do not know if you have heard (or read) that autism is one of those diseases that can be reversed, and or cured. And, I know that you had genetic testing done by doctors and all. But, it seems that the medical profession is very good at using "rabbit trails," to get people to focus on the wrong things, and to drive research on diseases, away from the real cures and causes (which are only two; Toxins and Parasites). According to Dr. Hulda R. Clark, Ph.D., N.D., one of the main causes of autism in children is exposure to lead. And, I know that most mothers do all that they can to keep their children from being exposed to different toxins, but the toxins and chemicals are showing up in so many different place and different ways in our envirnoment, to include our foods and even in the disposible diappers that children are put into, today. (Years ago, mothers used cloth diappers that were washed and reused, instead. However, Dr. Clark recommends that Mothers, today, at least line their child's diapper with a paper towel to keep the toxins that are found in the disposible diappers away from the baby's skin, and therefore being absorbed.) And, I know that your child is older, now. (Just in case you and your husband do decide to have more children.) At the least, I would recommend that you all get a copy of Dr. Clark's flagship book, called "The Cure For All Diseases." She does give examples of how and under what conditions that she has helped parents to reverse and, or cure autism, in young children. As the name of her book implies, all diseases are preventable and curable. Good Luck and Godspeed to you and yours.......See the link below.|`|AA10992895	What everyone here is saying is totally different than what I've heard... I've heard that you have a very HIGH chance of having more than one child in the spectrum. So, I don't know. That study that was done on the age of the fathers, I don't believe at all. I think it's just another grasp at trying to find blame for autism. I have a 4 yr old who is mildly autistic. They weren't sure if he was PDD-NOS or just high functioning, but knew he definitely wasn't Asperger's. He has made remarkable progress, but that's not the point. I was already pregnant with his brother when I found out he was autistic, and was scared to death. Josh is 2 now, and is perfectly fine. He has some mild sensory issues, but we all do, so that's no big deal. We are planning on trying for a third very soon. Yes, I know there are risks. But, my Tim is the most amazing child, and I would hate to think what I would be missing if I hadn't had him under the fear of 'what if.' We all know that with having children we risk them being born with any disease. That's just a part of life, and imagine what the world would be like if nobody had kids because of those fears. We wouldn't be here. I'm not saying my life is easy. I do all my own therapies, have spent countless hours researching, talking to other parents, learning from them how to manage my child's autism and more importantly, teaching him how to manage it. I will be homeschooling my kids, so I KNOW it's not going to be easy. But, I feel, that's my job. Nobody told me being a parent would be easy, that I would have perfectly healthy children who would live to be 100. For all any of us know, our 'normal' kids could be in a car accident at some point and become a vegetable that we have to raise for the rest of their lives. Does that mean we don't have kids for fear of that happening? That would be very sad, wouldn't it? I hope you are able to change your husband's mind, I know that has to be heartbreaking. Once we get that NEED to have another, it's so hard to stifle it. Please feel free to contact me, for support, and friendship. Best wishes to you and yours. Love those little ones with all your heart, they were given to you for a reason!|`|d9567b0787a20449c968e98b1851d837aa	I would err on the side of caution.  There are many families with  <br>  more than one child on the spectrum and probably many families with one. What about trying to adopt a child?|`|ec6967e5f27cf5a7421e21c0c61dfd09aa	The chances of a couple with one autistic child having another are very slim; there's some reseach suggesting multiple autistic children might have to do with a problem with the mother's antibodies; I wouldn't know.

Intra-uterine Insemination (IUI) is the process of placing the sperm directly into the uterus bipassing the vaginal cavity. <br>  <br>  There can be complications with IVF since there is a large amount of medication involved however it is very minimal.

1a94c33485a1f843c488943d171c11ffaa	If you have been trying to get pregnant for more then six months and nothing has happened make an appointment with your local Gynecologist to discuss the issue. There are many tests that they  can do to see if your hormone levels are still right, if you are ovulating, and they can check your partners sperm levels to make sure that that is OK too!. Good luck.|`|faa49a1082ae030ed5d0898cedf76862aa	you may have to see a infertility specialist to see what the problem may be.|`|AA10644766	To get pregnant you must have sex on a day that your eggs are being released.<br>  <br>  After the 3rd day from the day that menses started put a thermometer into your mouth and check your body temperature every morning before you start turning in bed. The best time is at about 4 a.m. Maintain a chart. You will find that on one day the body temperature drops from 1/2 degree to one degree. This is the day that your eggs are being released. If you want to get pregnant this is the day that you must have sex. Tell your husband to ejaculate on his inward thrust so that the sperms will shoot deep inside.<br>  <br>  After having sex you must stay in bed for about 30 mins with your knees bent up with a pillow under your buttocks so that the sperms will not pour out - to enable them to travel up. <br>  <br>  Get your husband to save his sperms in the testacles for at least 3 days before sex to enable them to mature well to do their job.|`|1ffc303db15fdc00d04d05f7b03f2f53aa	Make an appointment with your OBGYN.

5a3fe266cf6ca1246ffbbc6dbfee9cc3aa	I was just having the same conversation with a friend this morning.   We were trying to figure out when it became ok to have a baby before having a husband.  Why is it cool to have a boyfriend and a baby?  And just who is supporting these children?  Is your brother holding down a job to buy diapers and formula?  Is she holding down a job to buy diapers and formula?  Are your parents and her parents stuck with the burdon of another family to support?  Are your parents kicking your brother's behind to support his child?   I'll guess that either the parents are footing the bill,  or we are,  with welfare and wic.<br>  <br>  Welfare and WIC are two very important programs and I do not begrudge anyone assistance when they need it.   However, 16 yr olds belong in school not in someone's bed!!    As my kids get older my friends are encouraging me to change the shift I work...they tell me my kids are old enough to be home alone.   And they are,  just old enough to be home while I run up the street to take one to dance,  or to the school to pick one up after an activity,  for a few unscheduled minutes 30 or less it is okay.  But the older they get the more I feel I need to be at home to be involved with all that they do and who they are associating with.  Call me crazy,  but I don't want to be responsible for my grandchildren yet.   And maybe that is the problem we are not makeing these kids RESPONSIBLE for their actions.   I am a parent...not my child's friend...not yet anyway.  When they are grown and gone then we can be friends...till then:  PARENT.  And maybe that's the other part of the problem.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you should talk to your brother...ask him how many diapers he has bought and changed.  Make him think about what he has really done.   That child needs his father...to be a father not just a once in a while buddy.   Maybe if he starts to take responsibility for his child he won't want another one right now.  Someone should talk to him...|`|4d8f26d6176501887539914f8063d541aa	Judging by your spelling and grammar, I'd say you're rather young too. Don't you think it's a little hypocritical to say what you are?

I am not sure if there is any drs in the state that you are looking to have it done, but there are plenty of doctors. <br>  <br>  I just had mine done on the 11th of November by Dr. Perez for 2665 plus airfare for two.  He is in Mexico (be done with the stereotypes).  I have pictures if you want to see.  www.riobravoreversal.com<br>  <br>  The doctors in the states seems to be charging anywhere from 4000-7000 dollars.  I would suggest you go to yahoo and type in tubal reversal and the state where you are looking to get it done.  Several sites will come up that should direct you in the right place.<br>  <br>  HTH|`|5f4c8a15e28fc859b2703bb101c36917aa	It costs a lot and it doesn't always work, so I would do lots of research before you spend the money
103a215bd88efed55afc972db937f404aa	www.riobravoreversal.com<br>  <br>  I just had mine done on the 11th of November.  The doctors and nurses are very nice and it is a very clean and peaceful hospital.  <br>  <br>  the cost of the reversal was 2665 plus airfare for two people.  They provide hospital accommodations a day before and a day after the surgery at no additional cost.<br>  <br>  Edit:  People put their lives at risk when entrusting doctors here in the states.  The united states has the HIGHEST rate of malpractices.  Stereotypes and lack of knowledge are what keep people from finding good care.  No matter where it is.<br>  <br>  Just because it is in Mexico, does not mean that they are unsanitary, outdated, or that you are going to come back with some rare disease.  I would not have gone if I did not feel comfortable and did not do my research.

The cost is very low and the medical services are very good in India.<br>  <br>  My cousin and her husband got their IVF treatment in India through the Forerunners Healthcare in India and is all praise for this company. She is a known case of PCOS.She is a very happy mother of a baby boy now. She just paid 2500 pounds for the full IVF treatment in India for which she was quoted 8000 pounds in private setup in UK.<br>  <br>  Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the newspapers. I have also read about a Chinese couple who planned surrogacy through the Forerunners Healthcare. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery and infertility treatment like IVF, IUI, and ICSI abroad for low price. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery and treatment  can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com</a><br>  Hope this helps.|`|5718acfaae5c8b810d26ed311a3e9829aa	Ever insurance is differant but I know mine does not.

617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	This may be long, but it's all important information.<br>  <br>  NO, it's not "impossible to find out you are pregnant from an OPK".  <br>  <br>  Ovulation predictor kits show positives for MANY pregnant women.  Ovulation predictors detect LH, luteinizing hormone, which is (obviously) associated with ovulation.  Pregnancy tests detect hCG, the hormone associated with (of course) pregnancy.  LH and hCG are, at the molecular level, VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL.  The hCG just has an extra subunit, a little "doodad" thingy, if you will.  <br>  <br>  It doesn't work the other way around, though.  An OPK looks for the "body" of the molecule, the part both LH and hCG have in common.  A pregnancy test, on the other hand, looks for the "doodad", the part that screams "pregnancy"!<br>  <br>  Read about this here: <a href="http://www.peeonastick.com/opkhpt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.peeonastick.com/opkhpt.html</a><br>  <br>  So you might actually be pregnant.  There are two more possible explanations.<br>  <br>  Some OPKs are flawed; they do not work properly.  Just as some HPTs develop false negatives and such, OPKs can do the same.  If all of these were the same brand, or from the same kit, go back to the store and try a new kit in a different brand.  See if your results change.<br>  <br>  The last possible explanation, if you are not pregnant and it is not the OPK itself that is flawed, could be a medical condition called PCOS, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.  It is characterized by cysts on the ovaries, which (since they are located on the ovaries) stimulate production of high levels of LH ... exactly the hormone your OPK is testing for.  Some women have no other symptoms, but the majority (if tested this way) do show these consistently high LH levels.    <br>  <br>  Read about OPKs and PCOS here: <a href="http://www.peeonastick.com/opkfaq.html#6." rel="nofollow">http://www.peeonastick.com/opkfaq.html#6...</a><br>  <br>  If you get a negative HPT and another brand gives this positive throughout your cycle, definitely call your gynecologist for an appointment and ask about PCOS.  Even if you have no other symptoms, print out that page and show him/her that you're serious about this.  Since you're trying to conceive, it's especially important to rule out PCOS.  Anything wrong with your ovaries is not good for conception.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11226053	No, each test looks for diffrent hormones, so it would be impossible to find out you are preg from a ovulation test, see you doctor & try charting body temp on babycenter.com|`|0c53015d05430263b3ef55875bc4be2aaa	OVULATION TEST TELL YOU THE DAYS YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE FERTILE, BY MEASURING HORMONES.   YOU SAID THEY WERE RANDOM DAYS SO CHANCES ARE THAT THEY ARE CORRECT. YOU WERE PROBABLY JUST GETTING READY TO OVULATE OR JUST OVER OVULATION. WHICH ARE ALL POSSIBLE FERTILE DAYS.   I BELIEVE YOU ARE SUPPOSE TO TEST ON CONSECUTIVE DAYS STARTING WITH A DAY 14 AFTER THE START OF YOUR LAST PERIOD. TRY FOLLOWING THE DIRECTIONS ON THE PACKAGE AND PERFORMING THE TESTS CORRECTLY, IF YOU STILL GET WEIRD RESULTS CHECK WITH A DOCTOR.<br>  <br>  NO YOU IT CAN NOT CONFUSE YOU BEING PREGNANT, BECAUSE THAT IS A DIFFERENT HORMONE AND YOU WOULD GET A NEGATIVE TEST RESULT.
a31037573608b129e3f11fb3f33508b6aa	Is that normal for you?  Perhaps you should let your doctor know?

617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	Sure you can say "masturbation".  Why not?  As long as you're not crude about it, you're fine.<br>  <br>  No, I never have brown discharge afterward.  <br>  <br>  I don't think it's an STD, honey, if that's your only symptom.<br>  <br>  It could be implantation bleeding.  If that's the case, this is happening because the embryo implanted a few days ago but the blood hasn't actually come out, as it should.  It's mixed with your vaginal fluids and cervical mucus, which might be too thick to let the blood flow, and turning brown before it comes out.  Your masturbation is disturbing things enough to get it to flow.  <br>  <br>  Wait for your period.  If it doesn't come, take a pregnancy test.  If that comes out negative, make an appointment to get a blood test done and maybe also test you for STDs, just since you're worried.  <br>  <br>  There's a third possibility.  Sometimes I have brown discharge after sex if there wasn't enough lubrication.  You know, some women can bleed afterward, just from the chafing.  Well, my fluids, I guess, are thicker and mix with the blood before it starts to flow.<br>  <br>  So hang tight 'til you're period's due.

If so, it probably was implantation bleeding.  Some women can get brown discharge, old blood, after having an orgasim because this causes the uterus to contract and expel anything that's leftover from a period.

Like watching your cervical mucus, maybe charting your temperature, making sure he wears boxers and not briefs, etc.  There are so many other things that play into it.<br>  <br>  Sorry it didn't happen this month.  There's always next month to try. : (|`|fad19796958a03b7595c8e67f22ec88aaa	Firstly, they only indicate ovulation **COULD** becoming.  And I say that because you can have that LH surge, but not really ovulate (sometimes your body just may not do it).  I don't think that is extremely common, though...more in people who may have some other fertility issues.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you can ovulate....time everything perfectly...and not get pregnant.  It really isn't that easy.  Just because you have sex doesn't mean you ARE going to get pregnant.   It's funny because we spend so much time trying NOT to get pregnant and then we want to, we realize it isn't always so easy!!!<br>  <br>  Some couples go at it for a year before it happens.

Good Luck!|`|AA10075286	Hello -- I will tell you just how to get pregnant.You need to<br>  go out and buy the Ovulation Kit, called, FIRST<br>  RESPONSE. What this kit really does it tests your urine<br>  the very first thing. Then when it turns blue then you can have a baby. Believe me it really works as my time clock was ticking. It doesn't give you gender it gives you a<br>  baby. So Good Luck!
617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  It's not an allegation, it's PROVEN.  So you should ask "Does the state have cause to remove the child from mom on this one FACT?"<br>  <br>  It proves that the mother is/was an irresponsible drug user.  Of course they'll remove the baby.  <br>  <br>  If you/she can get a relative (Who didn't know about the drug use!  They will NOT give the baby to someone who let her smoke marijuana and didn't report it!) to offer care, they'd give preference to the relative after processing paperwork.  But the baby would still have to stay in a foster home or at the hospital a few days for the paperwork to be done.<br>  <br>  Your/her only hope right now would be to counter their test with saying that you ate something ELSE that would cause that positive reaction.  And then you'd end up suing them for custody and wrongful removal, during which time they'd probably have you tested again.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, you/she could admit wrongdoing and voluntarily go to rehab while that family member who didn't know about the drugs takes care of the baby.  After you're/she's out and clean for a while you/she can petition the court to return custody.  But even then they'll probably make you/her submit to random drug testing.  <br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|AA11906588	I dont know if they can of not but I assume they will! <br>  <br>  I hope they do no baby needs a mother like that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|a5f1c0401c3a99ae85fe49f5fedf4b4caa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Once implantation occurs, then the hcg does rise (doubles each day) and that happens rougly 5-10 days after ovulation.<br>  <br>  However, nobody can tell you if you could be pregnant or not.

617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	Implantation bleeding usually happens around your period.  Lots of women mistake it for that.  It doesn't have to be a long time before.<br>  <br>  If the embryo implanted the day your period was due, then that could be why you're not getting a positive yet!  You should wait at least a few days after implantation to test.  It might be too early.  Everyone's hormones are different.<br>  <br>  The only time I was pregnant I didn't get a positive until AF was already 9 days overdue.  I had implantation bleeding the very day I expected my period.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!  And good luck!|`|AA11226053	No you are not testing too early, and yes you still have a chance.

617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	An OPK (ovulation predictor kit) is very similar to an HPT (home pregnancy test).  It detects ovulation, which is when your ovaries release an egg into the fallopian tubes to make it available for fertilization and possibly pregnancy.<br>  <br>  It comes in a box that looks nearly the same, except it'll say "ovulation" instead of "pregnancy".  They should even be on the same shelf at the store.<br>  <br>  It comes with refill strips as well, because you're supposed to test more often than just once a cycle.  After those are gone you have to buy more strips.<br>  <br>  You pee on a stick, just like an HPT, following the directions in a box.  The directions will also say how to tell if it's positive.  If it's positive ovulation is/was near and you should have sex if trying to conceive.<br>  <br>  The directions will also tell you how often to test and when in your cycle to start testing.<br>  <br>  Prices vary.  The least expensive are just as reliable as the most expensive.|`|738cc40542d1484e903792ee2309e914aa	If it is the same thing I am thinking of, It tells you when you are ovulating, therefore you can tell when you are at your greatest chance of getting pregnant.|`|52c6b34c98bcff2b4e980895a08959efaa	There are a few different types... I used the pee sticks. You pee on one stick a day and it tells you when your Lh surge is, so you know when you ovulate. There is also one where you spit on a little things and microscope it, if it is feathery looking you are ovulating. You can also buy a basal thermometer. You temperature varies by a degree or two during ovulation and by charting it, you can see when it happens.|`|de60502fc3103353ca6adcdbbb0cbe85aa	it tells you when you are ovulating

PCOS (cysts on the ovaries) if you've ever had irregular periods, your husband's sperm count, your egg quality, etc.  It's entirely possible that you now have a fertility problem that you didn't have then.<br>  <br>  That being said, you are still young and likely at least ABLE to conceive.

This is the hardest thing to do but you just have to show that you have faith and patience.|`|ccdea2b73c1d4a52b946457baf6bdb16aa	yes it is possible|`|d34b190e142b86211f09fa7814284b00aa	It's pretty common to have trouble with having a second child.

If your concerned see your doctor who can tell you if there is a reason.|`|dabdaada9c2e2f27b6168b6f91a93a36aa	If you're asking if having your child at 14 caused you to be unable to bear children now, then you've come to the wrong place.<br>  <br>  Many people can not conceive due to unknown factors! Yes, the trauma of have a child at a young age *could* have caused your inability to have another child. Or not.<br>  <br>  Yes, it's possible, but no one here can tell you if that was the case. <br>  <br>  If you want professional answers, go to the doctor/OB-GYN. You should simply try to treat the problem you have NOW; you can't go back in time and change events.<br>  <br>  Hugs and Kisses<br>  <br>  God bless you!

The baby may not be dead, but there could be serious issues.|`|AA10102648	when you haven't felt the baby move in a long time....but towards the end that is not a good indicator because there isn't much room to move.....see your OB and listen for the heartbeat and/or sonogram.|`|809e03f47014d58c0e73a0ae023695b3aa	A girl that i know had a stillborn and her symptoms were, she got really sick  as in a high fever and cramps but no blood and baby wasn't moving anymore. Unfortunately the baby was dead she was around 5 1/2 months pregnant (God Bless Her) Every person is different so that's why is always important to go to your checkups and making sure your baby is moving in there. In my opinion of course.

AA11871343	Metformin is not a fertility drug. It is not a drug designed to make someone ovulate (like some of the other responses indicated).  Metformin is an insulin sensitizing drug. It is often given to diabetic people or women with PCOS. The underlying cause of PCOS is insulin resistance. My guess would be that the doctor suspects that you have PCOS and that is why he prescribed the metformin. I would call your doctor and ask him specifically why he prescribed metformin and ask him if he thinks you have PCOS and why (it is very possible to have regular periods and still have PCOS) It is also possible to have regular periods and not ovulate (or have good enough ovulation to get pregnant). <br>  <br>  PCOS is the number one cause of female infertility. It usually causes irregular cycles and lack of ovulation. (the metformin treats the PCOS, causing you to ovulate regularly, but is not an ovulation drug..make sense?). <br>  <br>  There are many symptoms of PCOS. Take a look at <a href="http://pcos.itgo.com/." rel="nofollow">http://pcos.itgo.com/.</a> It has a great overview of PCOS and the symptoms. Some of the more common ones are: lack of ovulation, irregular cycles, overweight (especially in the middle belly area), facial hair, skin tags, thinning hair, acne, depression (however, there is a huge list at that web site). It only takes one or two symptoms to actually have PCOS. <br>  <br>  If you have PCOS or want to find out more info about it, I recommend visiting <a href="http://messageboards.ivillage.com/iv-bhpcos?redirCnt=1." rel="nofollow">http://messageboards.ivillage.com/iv-bhp...</a> It's a great place to ask all your PCOS questions or just to have support. Oh...if you have PCOS..don't worry. It is possible to get pregnant and you are on the right treatment for it. There is a ton more info about PCOS and metformin at that message board. Good luck.|`|617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	Metformin isn't ONLY for women with PCOS or insulin resistance.<br>  <br>  The main purpose of it is to make you ovulate.  Of course women with PCOS take it.  They don't ovulate!  You can have 'periods' without ovulating, so don't think bleeding means you're ovulating.<br>  <br>  So don't freak.  Your doctor would have told you (hopefully) if he/she thought you have PCOS or insulin resistance.|`|0c39b49499afb4290a50c3f324ce0b0faa	If you were having a problem ovulating, isn't that like PCOS? In PCOS the egg is not released from the ovary, instead it becomes a cyst. Not sure how metformin works, I was going to be put on it but I lost weight and got my periods back. I think the drug has more to do with insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes which are affiliated with the horomonal imbalance linked to pcos (higher testosterone levels).<br>  <br>  If you are having trouble ovulating it seems logical metformin would be tried.|`|63401750cd4fccf4645c9c7e89a75e81aa	I have PCOS and diabetic. I was on it, it did nothing for me. BUT the success rate is pretty high in those with PCOS. Matter fact, my best friend got PG while on it and she is PCOS. That with low carb diet and stayed away from a lot of dairy she conceived. It was truly a miracle.<br>  <br>  It can't hurt you... it works alot of the time. If after a few months it doesn't maybe you need to try something else.<br>  <br>  RELAX is the first step.....it happens when you don't expect it.<br>  <br>  You will be fine.. have faith and pray...<br>  <br>  Best wishes..|`|AA10615906	This is not a answer why does your doctor want to prescribe this if you have regular menstral cycles????? I do not understand that. Most drugs prescribed for ovulation are because the woman does not ovulate regularly or at all.I am surprised by this. ALso there are many drugs that are used for more than one reason such as im an on a pysch med but it is prescribed for me because it is also used to treat headaches and neuropathy pain. which i have. But i am still curious why he feels you need a med for ovulation when you have regular periods. Unless hes trying to have you produce more eggs so theres a bigger chance of concieving which  may result in multiple fetuses. I would ask him what the reasoning is behind this. Dont be afraid to question.
51d2156a23d793ee82a75a570cd17722aa	I have been preg. twice and you really can't trust an ultrasound with thing like that. If you wait until you have the baby you can count back about 36 weeks from  that date and you have an aprx. date of conception.

A general guideline is 14 days after your period.  But that is NOT true for all women, so if you're asking this as a way to find out paternity, it won't work.  Sorry.<br>  <br>  If your cycle is 'normal', the sex act that got you pregnant occurred during the week beginning September 15.  If there's more than one possibility during that week, then I can't help you further.<br>  <br>  But anyway, congrats on the baby!|`|7d73d0d84ad2a1ee229bb7368e821414aa	you ovulate 14 days before your next period. so work it out from there.|`|AA11177435	Congratulations, This is only an estimate going from your period not the ultrasound but it should be about the same time approximately,<br>  <br>  Estimated conception: September 24th 2006<br>  Estimated due date: June 17th 2007<br>  Estimated fetal age: 12 weeks, 3 days.<br>  <br>  I hope this is close to the due date they gave you from the ultrasound, I am to tired to work it out but I have found this on:<br>  <br>  www.due-date-calculator.com<br>  <br>  Hope this is helpful best of luck and enjoy your pregnancy.|`|AA11392346	There are two main variables here that really make date of conception nothing but an educated guess: The time from sexual intercourse to actual conception can vary (impregnation doesn't happen immediately!) and the ultrasound itself. Much of the accuracy of ultrasound is in the experience of the technician doing the measurments and readings and whoever interprets them. The truth is many don't get very good training, and it is possible they just somehow "matched" your baby's size to what would be expected for someone with a 28 day cycle. However, even in the hands of the best technician, ultrasound dating is NOT 100% accurate, although at that stage of pregnancy it is usually accurate for dating with a leeway of +/- a few days.<br>  <br>  If your periods are regular at every 33 days your most LIKELY date of conception would be on September 24th. This would have made the baby 7 weeks and 6 days on Nov. 4th. This is NOT a huge difference from what the ultrasound report said (which matches exactly with someone with a 28 day cycle instead of 33 days.)<br>  <br>  With 33 day cycles your estimated due date would be June 20th.<br>  <br>  Claudine|`|AA12118593	I'm pretty sure babycenter.com has a calendar.

617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	That's not true.<br>  <br>  Even if it was, you do not expel ALL sperm with one ejaculation.  So there would still be 'leftovers'.<br>  <br>  Sorry.

617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	That actually sounds more like an early miscarriage, not a pregnancy symptom or a period.<br>  <br>  If it is, I'm sorry.

It's more likely that you have a condition called hypraplasia (don't think the spelling is correct, sorry).  Your Gyn. could explain in more detail than I.  I used to bleed and pass clots for several weeks when I was younger (18-26; I am now 38).  My doctor recommended birth control to regulate my cycle. It took several birth control pills before I found one that didn't make me sick.  I can understand you are most probably worried but the best thing you can do is see your doctor.  <br>  If you are having severe cramping and/or pain, or fever along with this bleeding I suggest you call the hospital immediately.

d5cf80d5a31ee59b9e9e79552ec0124daa	No, fertility is based on your own body. Generally, you ovulate day 7-14 of your cycle. However, everyone is different. You can buy ovulation tests to see what day of your cycle you are most fertile. If you want to get pregnant, try having sex every day days 7-14 of your cycle.|`|fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	Your mother's genetics has nothing to do with your fertility.

However, remember that the father of the baby has rights to be a parent just as much as you do.  Talk it over with him and make the decision together.  Get counseling…Planned Parenthood is there to help you find an agency.  Go online to the links below and see what kind of parents are out there looking to adopt a baby like yours.  Whatever you do (keep or allow someone else the opportunity at parenthood that they otherwise wouldn’t have) remember that your main concern should be your love for the child.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	Honey, didn't we already answer this a couple days ago?<br>  <br>  Nobody is going to tell you what to do.

It's 1-800-230-PLAN.<br>  <br>  They can make an appointment with a professional counselor so you can discuss your options.  They will get you prenatal care. If you choose adoption they will refer you to a good agency.  If you choose to keep it they will refer you to women's help agencies and also the government offices where you can apply for WIC and Medicaid.<br>  <br>  Please, please call them.  No stranger on the internet can tell you what to do with your life.  See one of their counselors, ask for their help, and it will be much easier to decide.  I promise you that.  They WILL NOT pressure you to get an abortion.  Or anything else.<br>  <br>  Your care there, the counselor and the prenatal care both, will likely be free since you're still in high school and don't much money.  So why not take the help they offer and make things easier on yourself?<br>  <br>  I hope you can find the strength to call them.  If not perhaps ask your roommate or boyfriend to call for you.|`|047af378b1100d1b95a75ee7b2a4db21aa	Adoption might be great option--kudos to you for not wanting to abort your baby.

I understand that you want to give your child the best, every mom does. I understand what you are saying and the decision is yours. I can only tell you what I would do if I were in your shoes. I personally wouldn't give my baby up for adoption, because my baby wouldn't deserve it. I would do the best I could. While you are pregnant you can get a job and save up. While you are doing that you can study for and take you test to get your GED. It all depends on how determined you are to do this, because it doesn't only benefit your baby, but it benefits you as well. Just think about it, talk to the people closest to you. You know that you will have the support of your boyfriend and roommate. But let your boyfriend know ( if this is his child) that it isn't something that he can take lightly. A baby is a big responsibility, that will be there with him and yourself for the rest of your life.|`|1fe46641da4c3bcd582db25fedfbdffdaa	I would keep your baby.

617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	I believe what you're experiencing is called "tinea versicolor".  It is not really related to pregnancy, but in some women who already have it, it can be "activated" by pregnancy and become more obvious.<br>  <br>  It's a yeast-like infection of the skin cells, caused by a fungus which is always present on normal skin.  When your skin becomes too oily, too dry, or too anything, the fungus can start to grow and become noticeable.  It happens in different areas ... usually chest and/or back.  I personally have it both places and am not pregnant.<br>  <br>  In some people it is first activated by contact with contaminated water, or excessive sweating.  Sometimes the activation is genetic (as it is for me ... I have it ALL the time).  In your case, though, it's either activated by pregnancy, or during pregnancy you sweat more or less, causing the fungus to grow.<br>  <br>  There is no way to cure it forever.  A dermatologist can give you a cream, or using Selsun Blue shampoo on the area also helps.  But nothing can get rid of the fungus because it is a normal thing on your skin.  Using the cream or shampoo should disguise it for a week or so at a time, so you could self-treat once a week so long as you're pregnant.<br>  <br>  Try those things and read some more information here:<br>  <a href="http://www.aocd.org/skin/dermatologic_diseases/tinea_versicolor.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aocd.org/skin/dermatologic_di...</a><br>  However, I don't know why that site says it stops in middle age.  My grandmother had it her entire life.<br>  <br>  You can also use an anti-itch cream on it.  Sometimes the shampoo makes the fungus invisible but does not cure the itching.  Mine goes away completely with the shampoo, but that might not be the case with you.|`|1203d31ab3bc3d0447a306d55a7bde5faa	It sounds like you're experiencing a heat rash.  You're probably getting this while you're pregnant because 1) your body chemistry has changed and 2) there is not as much air circulating around and under your breasts because of your large abdomen.  The best all-round treatment is a good body powder; if you're sensitive to talc, then cornstarch-based powder is a good alternative.  Also be sure to consider whether or not you're sensitive to any perfumes, and stick to a mildly-scented type.|`|2d32d733f5cddac474674f2ded124160aa	HI, <br>  My cousin got a nasty 'pregnancy rash'.

a16ff4b21d11c68313dffd868fb9adf7aa	Well, implantation bleeding probably wouldn't be mistaken for a period. This is a very light bleeding, so you could actually be having a period.<br>  <br>  But, even if you have a period, you could still be pregnant.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that even if you did try five times you might no be pregnant. You have to have sex when you're ovulating. If you have a 28 day cycle, ovulation occurs around day 14. Each cycle you only have about a 25% chance of conceiving, so it could take a few months. It takes the average couple 8 months to conceive.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, you could very well be pregnant. Pregnancy is possible anytime you have unprotected sex. I suggest you go to the doctor, for a blood test. I stopped taking my birth control pills and got pregnant about 2 weeks after that, so you can get pregnant right when you start trying. <br>  <br>  See a doctor, and congratulations if you are!|`|003eac43cc98ad3be51173345d9442e3aa	Wait until after you stop bleeding, and two days after that.|`|27541798c3fccb2c737be96dd397ec8caa	9 days. post supposed period or lack there of.|`|836406ee74c093eb564981c032ef3416aa	if your on your period..then...you are NOT pregnant|`|AA10713443	The day after your missed period but if you don't know when that is then 19 days after unprotected sex should be the earliest that you check.|`|AA11015378	If you are having a pretty normal period you are probably not pregnant.

Briefly: the home pregnancy test (HPT) works by detecting a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG.) When an egg is fertilized, it takes about 6 to 12 days to implant in the uterus, and then it begins to secrete hCG. It takes another day or two for enough hCG to build up and make its way into your pee. So, generally speaking, the earliest you can expect a positive HPT is 8 days past ovulation ("DPO") and the latest would be about 16 DPO. It is possible to get a positive test earlier or later, but not as common. In my experience, if you use a sensitive "early" test (anything that detects 25 mIU/mL of hCG or less) you can test around 12-14 DPO and feel reasonably secure with your results (the later you test, the more secure you can feel in its accuracy.)<br>  <br>  If you do not chart or monitor your fertility in any way, and you think you may have conceived, you should wait 19 days (or longer) after having sex to test. Why 19?! Sperm can live approximately 5 days in the proper environment; if the sperm managed to live until you popped an egg, the actual conception could have taken place several days after the sex act that got the sperm there. To make sure you're not testing too early, assume the sperm had very long lives (5 days is considered a very long sperm life) and that conception occurred then. Then allow 14 days for the embryo to implant and develop enough hCG to show up on a pregnancy test (96% of pregnant women will test positive by then.)<br>  <br>  Note: some HPT's say "test 5 days before your period is due!" or some such thing. Please note they are assuming a textbook 28-day cycle, with ovulation on Day 14. "5 days before your period is due" thus really "translates" to 10 DPO.<br>  <br>  So yeah ... wait 19 days after the last day you think you could have conceived.
08baf6f337bc2561562fe209621b1549aa	No, however, I know my girlfriend did.  They are a lot more common than positive results.  Maybe you did the test too early to detect HcG.  If it is early, then I suggest getting a blood test done to see if there is HcG deteced in your blood.  It is 100% accurate and you will know your answer sooner.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Merry Christmas|`|08978edb64e3ad1547f9c30ccce0e022aa	yeah im convinsed that i am and i am continuasly getting them so there is always a possibility|`|617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	Yes, but it wasn't technically a 'false negative'.<br>  <br>  My hCG levels weren't high enough for it to detect yet.  So the test itself didn't give me a false answer and it wasn't defective.  I just should have waited longer and/or used a more sensitive test.<br>  <br>  I got that five days after my period was due.  I finally got a positive with a different (more sensitive) brand a few days later.|`|493628e57db9bea90ef201d589c0b0cfaa	yes it is possible to have false negative. It may be to early for the test to read your HCG level. If you are really anxious to know go to the doctor and have them do a test they are much more accurate.|`|7c8a04f11df091360dfb7062b357adc8aa	My first test was negative - i took it 5 days before my period was due (i already knew i was pregnant, i just wanted confirmation).<br>  <br>  After that i waited 6 days and took one again. It was positive and i'm currently 22wks pregnant.|`|8b70b962257dfa387c69707168e221d4aa	yes yes yes I have!<br>  <br>  okay, now to clarify. I've had three pregnancies. In all three of them I tested ASAP. With the first two pregnancies, I used the same brand test, generic WalMart brand, and got faint lines on both, but nonetheless, positive results. The third pregnancy, I tried those First Response tests, that are supposed to tell you UP TO 5 days early. I bought two, and they sucked! I took the first one 5 days early, odds of accuracy are lower than the day after your missed period, and it said no. I took on the day before I was due to start, and it said NO!!!! Unable to accept the fact that I was not pregnant, I went and bought a generic WalMart test, and took it the same day as my last First Response test. It was positive before I could finish taking it!<br>  <br>  Now here's the kicker. I had twins last time! Twice as many babies, twice as much of the pregnancy hormone in the system! Morale of the story? Generic is just as good, and in my opinion better, than the store bought ones. Why waste your money?<br>  <br>  Oh and yeah, it's absolutely possible to get false negatives on urine tests, false positives are much much less likely!|`|faa49a1082ae030ed5d0898cedf76862aa	yes, I have twice with both of my kids the reason for them to come out false is because the HCG level was not high enough to show so I had to go get blood done then it showed up that I was!|`|3cf52acdea2e2d733955331bee60b76faa	False negatives are much more common than a false positive.  Pregnancy tests available to the public test for the presence or absence of a pregnancy hormone in the urine.  The trick is that you have to test after the blood level of the hormone gets high enough (as in an advancing pregnancy) to spill over into the urine to be picked up by the test.  Many times in early pregnancy the blood level is simply not high enough yet to get to the urine, but you could still definitely be pregnant!  The over the counter tests are getting more sensitive and able to pick up lower and lower levels all the time.  But the Gold Standard is just to go get a blood test.  It's always reliable.  False positives are rare though, as the test would have to be picking up in error something else other than the hormone it is delveloped for.  Not a easy or common feat at all!  If a urine pregnancy test was positive for me,  I'd be picking out a crib and changing table.  If, however, I thought I was pregnant but the urine came back negative, I'd get a blood test before I'd let out my breath!|`|5632de3a9ae32031948ef9954704e6eeaa	I had 18 of them and it was a week after my period was late. Then I got a blood test and it was borderline. I finally got a positive about 1 1/2 weeks after my period was supposed to start. I hope this information helps. Good luck|`|6307f24377916b1ac8a4c55638cc212faa	I had 2 false negatives with my son and both were taken after the missed period.|`|92aaf5abaf7cd0810cb9ec857c31c8eeaa	It has never happened to me, but I'm sure it happens on occasion.  You should wait at least 10 days after a missed period to take a pregnancy test.  If you are getting them over the counter & it was negative &  you believe you are pregnant, go to your local women's health clinic; they will do a preg test & are probably more accurate!|`|AA11888411	no, but they are common. They can occur if its too early in the pregnancy....it can take up to five days for the egg to implant in the lining of the uterus. It can take several days after that for the hormone preg tests detect to build up in your system.|`|bd3c3f53778ce472a1cd00ff85b0bafaaa	YES! I took a test 7 days after having sex. I thought I couldn't wait another minute! The test was negative, but I'm certain I'm pregnant and all ready showing some symptoms. <br>  The level of hCG is what determines the results of your test. hCG begins to build up on the day of implantation in the uterus (which is generally believed to happen 7-10 days after sex). On the first day (implantation day!) the level of hCG is very low. But, the good news is-it doubles to triples everyday thereafter....SO...wait at least 10 days after sex and then test. Testing before that time will likely yield a "false negative". Also, test with the first urine of the morning OR only test with urine that has been in your bladder at least 4 hours. Those will have the highest concentrations of hCG. Hope this helps!
617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	If you're like most women, you've probably been taught that a woman's cycle is 28 days and she ovulates on day 14 (or 'between day 12 and day 16). Actually, this is a myth. These are only statistical averages, and length of cycle and day of ovulation vary widely among women. It even varies for each woman!<br>  <br>  A typical cycle, which begins with menstruation, is 25-36 (NOT only 28 days as most people say) days with ovulation typically occurring between days 12-18. However, it may not be that way for you! And even if your cycles are regularly the same length, you may not ovulate on the same day every cycle. The only way to determine when you have ovulated is to track your fertility signs by recording basal (waking) body temperature and/or gauging the changes in the quality of your cervical fluid, since it becomes more fertile (hospitable to sperm) nearer ovulation. Ovulation predictor urine tests can also help determine when you will ovulate. Generally, you are fertile up to 5 days before ovulation, since sperm can generally live in a woman's body for up to 5 days in fertile cervical fluid, and a couple days after the day of ovulation, because an egg can live up to 24 hours, and occasionally a second egg is released within 24 hours of the first.<br>  <br>  When a cycle varies in length, it is the time between menstruation and ovulation that varies. Less variable in length is the luteal phase, or the time between ovulation and the end of your cycle (the last day before your next period). The luteal phase typically lasts between 10 and 16 days, but it will not usually vary more than 1 or 2 days for each woman. So if, for example, your luteal phase is 11 days, it will usually always be 10-12 days. The luteal phase provides time for a fertilized egg, or embryo, to travel to the uterus to implant. The typical embryo implants 6-12 days after ovulation. Your body produces the hormone hCG when the embryo implants. hCG is the hormone detected by pregnancy tests. If no embryo implants, the uterine lining is shed, beginning the next cycle.<br>  <br>  When you see fertile cervical mucus, you will ovulate within the next 24-36 hours.  So if you're trying to conceive, start having sex now ... and keep having it for the next week (so that even if you ovulate 36 hours from now, you'll still catch the two fertile days).  Good luck!|`|0de6b468c56c9f58671a8565ce732e94aa	for better ovulation calender and u can put the day of ur last period. it will show u when u should be ovulating... this website really helps.|`|decc7960724803240bcffe832e835f5baa	if your cycles are 29 days long then you should ovulate on cd 15, you ovulate 14 days BEFORE your period starts. semen can look alot like fertile mucus si wait about 24 hours after having sex to check it. my period started on the 3rd and ended a couple days ago, it was short as usual but my cervix is pretty high right now and a had a little bit feritle mucus yesterday but not today. so just keep doing it every day until cycle day 20 or so to be sure|`|a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	If your period is a 29 day cycle and the first day of your last period was December 1, 2006 then you would be fertile on the 13th through the 17th and your ovulation day would be december 16th.<br>  <br>  Your period should be due on December 30th<br>  <br>  In januray you will be fertile on the 11th through the 15th and ovulate on january 14th.<br>  <br>  Your period should be due on January 28<br>  <br>  I done the above at this following website: Go to <a href="http://www.mymonthlycycles.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mymonthlycycles.com</a> and put in your period info and it will calculate when you will be fertile and ovulating.

Most women trying to concieve would do it on the or around the 11th-14th day, when you are farther apart its' more like trying the 13/14th day though like the 20th.|`|95b6f176242a5f9f4ba2b8bff98882a3aa	Yes, because you are still able to produce an egg, and get pregnant.|`|d2fb119057174fc2bd41e71975d480c0aa	yes i did
617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	I can't tell you and neither can a website!<br>  <br>  You HAVE to chart your fertility somehow.  Chart your BBT.  Use an OPK.  Observe your cervical mucus.  Something.  No formula or 'average' will be correct ... and then your chances of conceiving or not conceiving (whichever you're trying for) will be drastically lowered.<br>  <br>  Please don't count 14 days from your period, or 14 days before the next one's due, or any nonsense like that.  Besides, if you started that much early, your cycles are obviously irregular right now!  NO formula or rule will work for you this cycle!<br>  <br>  Simple way:  buy an OPK.  Start using it on day 10 after your period.  Since it's irregular you might need more than kit.  Test every two or three days until it turns positive.<br>  <br>  Even that will only tell you which WEEK you ovulate.  Some women ovulate the very day an OPK turns positive ... some ovulate a full 36 hours afterward.  So when it turns positive have sex all that week (since this is under TTC, I'm assuming you're trying).<br>  <br>  Please do that instead of just 'counting'.  Your fertility is worth enough to take a few minutes a day instead of the easy way out (which also happens to be totally wrong for most women).<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3ecf1a5445a005e12ccf49ad4323995aaa	Right now there'll be thousands of virgins looking up the word "ovulate" in their dictionaries!|`|4473fbb68efa817294e8de69b23d6c65aa	once you see clear cervical mucus... ovulation within hours or a day or so... that's a sign of ovulation...|`|AA11906588	Usually 14 days after your period!|`|da30f0e2ca932c8b2b71fe38507f4fdbaa	Go to www.mymonthlycycles.com<br>  You can put in the start day of your last period and it will tell you!|`|3f104b0fda99bf7286fbe966bbb6de5eaa	Go to the pharmacy and ask for an ovulation predictor kit.

7c8a04f11df091360dfb7062b357adc8aa	I burst into tears when i found out. I wasn't neccesarily young when i found out (25) but it was unexpected and i was very career focussed and always had been. My fiance was ecstatic (he's always wanted a baby - i had told him i'd entertain the idea as i got closer to 30). <br>  <br>  Anyway - all i thought was how this would affect my career aspirations and how i'd have to change my routine of working (18hrs a day/7 days a week sometimes) etc. Basically i thought about how i'd have to rearrange all of my careers dreams to accomodate a baby. And i wasn't sure i wanted to do that.<br>  <br>  I am now 22wks pregnant and boy have things changed. I've changed my work hours dramatically as i've realised my baby is more important than work. I've also realised i'm not "giving up" on my dreams - my dreams are just changing. My dreams are now of a happy healthy darling little baby whom i will love wholeheartedly for the remainder of my days. My dreams are of my fiance, my baby and myself as a happy family unit. I have no intention on completely forgetting my career path and goals, but for the moment they are simply on the back burner. And my fiance has been wonderful through out it all - letting it be my decision without any pressure. Although i forget it sometimes, i am a lucky gal!|`|220812e5ebc72abea6836075303312e7aa	I was scared...I did not know what to think. I found out I was pregnant at 32 wks, so obviously I had no time to prepare. I didn't know what I was going to do, how I was going to do it and so on and so on.......now my son is 2yrs old and is the love of my life.......and guess what...I made it!!

My partner was rapt when we got it confirmed, as was I. <br>  <br>  Of course we were nervous to begin with, but we had already discussed having kids down the track, the way I see it this is just a little sooner then planned. <br>  <br>  I think everyone is nervous about being a parent and raising a child, it's only natural!<br>  <br>  Good Luck and I hope everything goes well with the rest of your pregnancy!|`|14417d8fe729697bfab1c1273c202aa7aa	I was just 19 with my first pregnancy, I was scared, but a little excited.  I think you are feeling normal.  As long as you are in a healthy relationship, you really shouldn't have alot to be worried about.  When the baby is born, trust your mothering instincts for taking care of your baby.  Start buying baby supplies now.  Try and get them second hand.  It will save you a ton of money.  And start to but diapers right now for sure.  Buy a pack or 2 of size 1, and then a few more of the size 2, and then a few more of the size 3, and the same with size 4.  remember that you can always exchange them from wal-mart for a different size if you need to later.  But just try and buy one big pack or a box every time you get paid.  This will cut down on expenses later.  If you know someone else that is trying to get rid of their old baby stuff, don't hesitate to graciously accept the offer.  Trust me, the time you spend with your baby will be more important than what his furniture/baby stuff looked like.  good luck.  I am having my third baby within the week!|`|6787dc1bf50ed51fe546939051f8237aaa	i got pregnant when i was 19 and it was really unplanned..when i was at this situation I'm very afraid about everything,about how could i handle this at my age...no idea how to look after a baby and how to clean up everything but luckily when it happens i could say i had overcome all of those things need to know as a mother...and the blessing of god could be yours for the rest of your life...your baby...they are angels from heaven so be thankful to god for that...some other people having a hard time to have a baby but you...you are one of the luckiest person who had ever received a wonderful blessing...good luck to you...enjoy the blessings of god....|`|AA12107392	I got pregnant with my first child at 20.

Surprize. :)|`|617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	Well, my first pregnancy wasn't planned (I'm hoping to be pregnant again now ... TTC).  I had just turned 20.<br>  <br>  I was floored when I found out.  I mean ... I kind of wanted a kid in the back of my mind and so we'd agreed to not actively prevent it.  But I was not expecting it to happen so soon (2 months later).  Unfortunately, as soon as I started getting really excited about it, I lost that baby.<br>  <br>  But I am TTC again and I'm very excited about that.  Now I'm nearly 22.
AA11815208	Yes it regulates your period and helps you not get pregnant.|`|e6312d5cb3f4993549c9076d8e20febaaa	it wont help u concieve...its a protection type of thingi magini|`|617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	Of course birth control will regulate your period.  It forces your body into an unnatural (for you) 28-day cycle.<br>  <br>  Once you get off it, it might stay regulated, or it might be even more irregular.  Either is possible.<br>  <br>  No, birth control will not help you conceive.  It keeps you from getting pregnant.  And you don't need to regulate your cycles to conceive, anyway.  Just chart your fertility.  Use an OPK, chart your BBT, or observe your cervical mucus for signs of ovulation.<br>  <br>  If those things don't make sense to you, look them up before seriously trying to conceive.|`|da03b1492bdd179ac2434ce4095822d2aa	Yes it regulates periods. As far as the help in conceiving is concerned it sounds paradoxical, but YES, it helped some people. For this u have to take at least 3 cycles of pill regularly and then stop taking the pill. It is assumed that as a rebound phenomenon, the mechanism of conception triggers and u get pregnant!!
AA12380778	go to www.webmd.com and go to pregnancy/getting pregnant section and then create an ovulation calender. its easy. the wizard will ask you to enter your wife's last menstruation date and then it will display a monthly calender and you will see some options on top of it that will say try for a boy or try for a girl. and it actually tells you on what days to have sex and which positions to use.|`|06afede5d4f6bb406115eae9eae5ee32aa	It has been said that you will likely have a boy if you time intercourse to coincide with ovulation, and that you will have a girl if you have intercourse before ovulation.  Supposedly the sperm that result in males swim faster and die off quicker than the female type.  I know this was true for me; I have one of each and know exactly where I was in my cycle when I got pregnant.  I don't think the position makes a difference regarding the gender of the baby.|`|782ed88860ff1ccfc6a0624951d21d20aa	ummmm they say do it doggy style to have a boy and missionary to have a girl. A girl sperm is supposed to be stronger but slow and a boy sperm is supposed to be fast but not as strong!! If you do it for a girl have sex a  few (like 2 days before ovulation) If a boy do it on ovulation. <br>  <br>  That is what they say to do tell me if it works!!|`|617918b90ecadbac9239fb6b950664d8aa	No.<br>  <br>  People will tell you to have sex at a certain time in relation to her ovulation, or consult a Chinese birth chart to see when to have sex, etc.  But they don't work.<br>  <br>  Those things are based on the misguided notion that XX and XY sperm are different somehow.  They're not.  Those things work 50% of the time.  LOL.  What does that tell you?  You have a 50/50 chance ANYWAY!  So obviously they don't work.<br>  <br>  And really, positions?  That is equally ridiculous.  They'll work 50% of the time.  Which is not at all.<br>  <br>  Sorry.  You can't choose the sex.  Be happy with a healthy baby.

Have you had anything resembling OHSS symptoms so far?<br>  <br>  Also, I'm sorry to answer your question with a question, but if your doctors were concerned about OHSS, why on earth did they have you trigger in the first place?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry this cycle was a bust for you -- hopefully your next cycle will be the one!

The cost is very low and the medical services are very good in India.<br>  <br>  My cousin and her husband got their IVF treatment in India through the Forerunners Healthcare in India and is all praise for this company. She is a known case of PCOS.She is a very happy mother of a baby boy now. She just paid 2500 pounds for the full IVF treatment in India for which she was quoted 8000 pounds in private setup in UK.<br>  <br>  Forerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the newspapers. I have also read about a Chinese couple who planned surrogacy through the Forerunners Healthcare. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery and infertility treatment like IVF, IUI, and ICSI abroad for low price. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery and treatment can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.<br>  <br>  Many patients travel from United States of America and UK to get low cost surgery in India. Indian corporate hospitals are comparable to hospitals anywhere in the world. In fact, India has medical facilities that are comparable with the USA, UK and Canada. India offers World Class Medical Facilities, comparable with any of the western countries. India has state of the art Hospitals and the best medical experts. With the best infrastructure, the best possible Medical facilities, accompanied with the most competitive prices, you can get the treatment done in India at the lowest prices<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com</a><br>  Hope this helps.|`|fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	Hyperstimulation can be painful. Each time that I had completed any treatment I was at risk for hyperstimulation. You will most likely just feel bloated and have some discomfort. If it gets painful, call your doctor and have it checked out immediately. Hyperstimulation can last for several weeks though. When I completed my IVF, my doc said that I was hyperstimulated even though I was actually pregnant. And this was two weeks after my transfer. So if you haven't felt any discomfort yet then you are probably out of the woods.

Many people adopt only to have a child when they do as it is no longer a real pressing need to conceive. This is a very personal thing. Enjoying the creative act is not a given. Fear and ignorance can make it psychologically difficult and even physically uncomfortable. Men feel they are trying to prove something and women feel they have failed. What a terrible shame. Some testing might be in order as there are physical reasons for infertilite too. The easiest and cheapest is to have the man get a sperm count. So many males are the cause of the infertility but through ignorance they blame the woman. Just take a look at the Bible to see where this goes. If the testing confirms something is wrong there are many things which can be done to correct it. Some are not cheap, and others are not comfortable, but their is help available. One little ditty that was not mentioned yet is the rear entry position. The male penatration is usually deeper in this position and the sperm when deposited is spilled into the vagina in such a way that if the woman also has an orgasm the whole mechanism was designed to make her womb spasm at that time, (part of the pleasure sensation she feels) and the cervix, or the opening to the womb, curls in such a way as to push that opening into the sperm pool created by the man. This enhances the potential for pregnancy. If the woman does not orgasm, then she should lay on the bed for about a half an hour after the man's ejaculation, with her butt in the air, breasts on the bed so that his sperm pool surround the cervix and the potential is increased for the sperm to enter the womb and begin its miraculous journey. Good luck and have the best time making that little baby... that is what it is all about!|`|501aec01bc549bad6386970a99722880aa	Get an ovulation predictor kit.  Every woman's cycle is different so you may not be ovulating when you think you are.  After a year if you have not conceived consult with your Gynecologist and they may want to run a few tests to see whats going on.|`|AA11702127	Go to your Gynecologist and get a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist (RE).<br>  <br>  An RE specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of issues relating to fertility. A good RE can run some tests and help you uncover why you are not getting pregnant and then devise a treatment plan that will maximize your chances of getting pregnant. It's not failsafe, of course, but it's a definite step in the right direction.<br>  <br>  Some RE's will not see you until you've been trying for at least 12 months, but I would go ahead and get the process going now, as it sometimes takes a few months to get an appointment with a good RE.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, there are a few things you can do. Start charting your menstrual cycles. Keep track of the exact dates your period begins and how long it lasts. Keep track, also, of the dates on which you are having sex. <br>  <br>  There's an EXCELLENT book called "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" by Toni Wechsler. You can get it on Amazon. It is LOADED with excellent information, too.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you ~ I hope  you're bringing home a baby in your arms very, very soon.|`|dd36205386b4d45b795a450592da6d29aa	well i got pregnant the first month me n my fiance tried n now im almost 10 weeks along.  we used ovulation kits n when they were positive we baby danced. we put pillows under n i stayed in bed for a long long time. we baby danced every other day,<br>  good luck

As a babysitter myself, this is always appreciated, but I would never expect something like that.   <br>  <br>  Also, if you are the babysitter and it was a particularly difficult job, you can often increase your hourly rate by $0.50 or $1.00 when they ask you at the end.|`|bea2393a51ca0e4eb0ee3529fc306f25aa	I would offer her 15-20 dollars a day if you could swing that!

Probablemente ya no eres tan joven como cuando concebiste a tu primer bebé, eso no quiere decir que no estes en edad para volver a ser madre. Primero, lleva un seguimiento de tu moco cervical para que puedas identificar tu día pico, muchas mujeres no se quedan embarazadas porque creen que ovulan otro día. Dos, no tengas relaciones todos los días porque agotas la calidad del esperma de tu pareja. Hazlo cada tercer día comenzando tu ciclo fertil. Si no reconoces cuál sería tu moco cervical fertil, es parecido a la clara de un huevo, pero te recomiendo que revises el método billings porque te dan muchas pistas.

10399f1303e4d346b131a7568b21d9e2aa	My son is 11 months old and only just starting to show a real interest in food.  I started out with rice cereal in the mid-morning.  I would nurse him first and then offer him a few bites of the rice cereal mixed with breast milk.  Then I began also offering homemade pureed sweet potatoes or yams mixed with a little breast milk and rice cereal in the late afternoon after nursing him a little.  I also gave him a little water in a sippy cup in between meals.  He usually would only take a couple of bites, if that.  You really should just follow babies lead.  My son still sometimes chooses to only breastfeed.  Today he ate some homemade zucchini and yellow squash well cooked and a bite a oatmeal this morning.  He's big and thriving.  If you're planning on making your own baby food at home (it's super easy, saves money and is way more nutritious) there is a great kit at drugstore.com called 'Fresh Baby'.  It comes with an instructional DVD, a book that advises you what to feed and when, and two freezer trays for making baby food cubes.

I really hope this can help you! <br>  <br>  'Around sic months starting solids helps to get the feeding more regular too. Some babies are ready for a proper routine, with regular times by 5 or 6 months. You need to do what suits your baby and your hosuehold an dthese is no need to have a routine like this unless ou want to. Breastfed babies may prefer to feed to sleep or feed on waking and this is fine. However, some babies do benefit from some predictability about their day. <br>  <br>  An example of a possible baby's day at around 6 months. <br>  <br>  6am - Breastfeed on waking or bottle<br>  7am - Complementary food (solids), playtime<br>  8am - Settle to sleep<br>  10am - Breastfeed on waking or bottle, playtime<br>  12 noon - Settle to sleep<br>  2pm - Breastfeeding on waking or bottle, playtime<br>  4pm - Settle to sleep<br>  6pm - Breastfeed on waking or bottle<br>  6.30pm - Possible complementary food (solids)<br>  8pm - Settle to sleep<br>  <br>  It would be normal of a baby this age to have an overnight feed. <br>  <br>  Complementary foods could include pureer fruits, vegetables. <br>  <br>  For more information about introducing complementary foods see www.cyh.com. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that this pattern is only an example. It isn't necessary to have any particular pattern, although babies (and parents) usually are helped by some predictability in their day. There are many variations, do what suits you and your baby. For example, food in the morning may be given after the 10am or midmorning feed. It depends on what suits your baby and what fits in with the rest of the family'<br>  <br>  <br>  'Starting Solids'<br>  Breastmilk or infant formula is all your baby needs for the first 6 months, and is still the most important part of her diet for the next 6 months. So the best time to start solids is around 6 months, especially if your baby is breastfed. There is no rush, so allow plenty of time for your baby to learn the new skill or taking food from a spoon. <br>  <br>  The first food is usually rice cerea. Mix a little with water or your baby's usual milk to a fairly runny consistency at first, then firmer as the baby gets used to it. <br>  <br>  Offer a little cereal after a milk feed at a time of day when your baby is usually happy. Expect the process to be messy at first while your baby learns how to manage it. <br>  <br>  Gradually increase the amount until your baby is taking several teaspoonsful each time, once or twice a day. <br>  <br>  Next you can try pureed or mashed vegetables and fruit, one at a time at first, then mixed if you want. <br>  <br>  You can make up a quantity of mashed food and freeze it in ice cube trays. Store the blocks in a plastic bag in the freezer, ready to defrost when needed. <br>  <br>  After 6 pr 7 months you can try a range of other foods, such as custards and yoghurts, meat and fish. Move from pureed or well mashed foods to soft lumps by around 8 months, and then try finger foods (eg cooked vegetables, rusks)<br>  <br>  If ou wish you can offer solids before milk around the middle of the second six months, and move to a regular 3 meals a day with some snacks. <br>  <br>  By 12 months your baby should be enjoying similar foods to the rest of the family, cut up, and avoiding really strong flavourings. '|`|0840f45425370151d7c817f5ae77c734aa	Your baby will let you know when he is hungry.  You need to be a little more specific about what you are feeding your baby, also.  Breastmilk or bottle?  Are you giving him cereal yet, or just milk?  I have a 5 1/2 month old that is given only pumped breast milk.  He wakes at around 7:30, eats 5 ounces.

EHmLgpr6aa	I am very sorry for your loss. Unless your doctor has stated otherwise, you should be fine to resume normal intercourse as soon as you stop bleeding.<br>  If you are trying to concieve again, some doctors suggest you wait 1-3 cycles. However, some women find themselves very fertile just after a miscarriage.|`|B1UHqb6Naa	I guess it all depends on if you had an ectopic pregnancy, or something else that your Dr. can pinpoint as the cause of your miscarriage, like a hormonal problem.  Otherwise, most of the time they just "happen"  Which is not a very comforting thing to deal with, but it is true.  You can probably have sex anytime after you are no longer bleeding.  I would ask the Dr. for sure.  But I don't know why you couldn't.<br>  Sorry for your loss.

tSqjEZKjaa	Hola Mónica!!!<br>  Coincido con casi todos en que cuando llegues busques un pediatra, pero a la vez te recomiendo que al estar allá vayas al supermercado y también revises el contenido de las fórmulas y te guíes por la mas parecida a la que le das a tu bebé, ya que muchos doctores te recomiendan la que está de moda.  Cuando mi hijo mayor nació la de moda era la SIMILAC y no le cayó. La que le cayó muy bien fue la NAN (de nestlé).  Otra  cosa que hay que considerar es que el cambio de clima, de latitud y hasta  el agua, puede hacer que la fórmula que ahorita está tomando y le cae bien, al llegar a México ya no le caiga tan bien.<br>  Espero que vivas feliz en México.

113280eecd9fe64d59792a39520c512caa	HOLAAA!!!!<br>  Mira bien lo que  te diré.<br>  Primero que nada, lamento  comentarte que ningún día puedes estar segura a 100% de que no quedarás embarazada, si no usas métodos anticonceptivos eficaces,  ya que  incluso reglando hay un porcentaje de probabilidades de quedar encinta, aunque  te parezca increíble.<br>  <br>  De todos modos ahora te digo que  los ciclos de la mujer son diferentes e individuales. Todo depende de cuántos días hay entre una menstruación y otra.Deja me explico...<br>  En una muijer bien reglada, o sea que es REGULAR y tiene per+iodos de 28 días ella debe tomar en cuenta que ovula el día 14 y los 5 días entes y después del dia de la ovulación son los que  tiene mayor probabilidad de quedar embarazada. Los menos ¨¨peligrosos¨son los que están cerca de la menstruación, alrededor, antes y después y durante la regla...(una semana antes y una después del primer día de la regla), PERO, como ya te dije, siempre es mejor cuidarse y utilizar condón si no quieres embarazarte y si buscas embarazarte, el mejor momento es a la mitad de tu ciclo.<br>  <br>  <br>  Si no te queda muy claro, marca en un calendario de acuerdo a los días que dura tu ciclo, encircula el primer día de tu regla anterior y el primer día de tu regla presente y cuenta hasta llegar al  día que esté justo enmedio y ese día es tu fecha probable de ovulación. qUE ES CUANDO HAY MAS PROBABILIDADES DE EMBARAZO Y UNA SEMANA ANTES Y DESPUéS!!!<br>  OJO, para llevar el método del ritmo hay que ser muy regular!!!!<br>  Así se llama este método de contar días fértiles y no fértiles.<br>  <br>  Tengo la impresión de que eres muy jovencita, así que  espero que no lo tomes a mal y me permitas decirte que antes de tomar la desición de tener relaciones , investigues muy bien sobre este tema, lee todo lo posible sobre ETS y sobre embarazo y  busques y elijas un método anticonceptivo SEGURO Y DE ACUERDO A TUS CARACTERíSTICA S FíSICAS Y DE PREFERENCIA  indicado por un médico y recuerda que   una vez que inicies tu vida sexual activa, debes visitar a un Ginecólog@ periódicamente...para que tu salud siempre sea óptima.<br>  <br>  Si te asomas bien a las preguntas de este tema, vas a encontrar montones de jóvenes que se asustan y pasan por embarazos no deseados o por miedo y terror a estar embarazadas, a veces sin estarlo. Para que no  te pase lo mismo, primero infórmate bien y si puedes ve al médico para que te aconseje la mejor opción.<br>  <br>  La sexualidad es maravillosa, es un  derecho que todo ser humano tenemos y es una gran responsabilidad también. Ejércela con plenitud, de ser posible con amor y con placer y cuídate mucho y a tu pareja, si la amas también.<br>  <br>  Te mando mis mejores deseos y suerte!!!!|`|144e12548a78a3f3ea7f82c608274d06aa	Ni?a, sin condon NINGUNO, tu cuerpo no es una ciencia exacta.<br>  <br>  Ademas a ti no te han hablado de las enfermedades de transmision sexual??<br>  <br>  Vete a un centro de planificacion familiar y que te hablen de los metodos anticonceptivos.

a0e58fb2269ff0c5d91b5b4ba50a7075aa	Wow i think that is amazing as i am tring to conceive as well and am due for my next period on the 23rd! This means that you should have ovulated on the 9th. It would be way too soon to tell. I think that you should go to your doctor and speak to him/her. They might be able to give you a blood test and you might be able to tell soon.  Good Luck and i hope that you are pregnant.|`|3f414822a4020882c0df0fbc8b31807eaa	It could be but sounds a little early for implantation.  When did you ovulate?  I think it takes anwhere from 10 to 12 days past ovulation for implantation to take place.  Good luck though!|`|gWryQgf8aa	could be.. thats how i found out.. sore tummy.|`|B1UHqb6Naa	I've been pregnant 3 times and never had implantation spotting, so it is possible.|`|1c140a2168708b9527fa442e9ae67082aa	If your period isnt due until the 23rd, it sounds to me like you are ovulating right NOW.  Then again, if you are on a regular 28 days, its possible it could be implantation as well.  To me, they feel the same.  I cant really tell you since I do not know how regular your cycle is....<br>  <br>  I hope its implantation, however, since you are TTC! :)  Good luck!
AA12054896	I had this same problem twice this year, I wasn't pregnant, Thank god. I went to the doctor and they confirmed it, she also said this was normal and could be caused by several different things. Pill issues, stress, body recouping from the triple period, diet, exercise. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck on trying to have a baby, I hope for you that it is positive|`|4e8cd40d02dea72a780fb697201d9c7daa	well if you had 2 in one month it could be possible that it will skip this month since you had two. I don't think you are pregnant. That happened to me before, and I wasn't. I don't know if it was a "glitch" or what because it only happened that one time last year and it's been regular after that. But if you were pregnant you wouldn't have had any last month or this month. I know a lot of women that undergo stress or depression end up with missed periods because of a chemical imbalance of the female hormones. My cousin missed 2 months of her period and she wasn't pregnant. So you did the right thing. But if you are still unsure I would wait a month and take it again, or wait if your period comes on then take it again.|`|QgjhMwZVaa	wait for another month. it doesnt necessarly mean that you are pregnant. sometimes you 'skip' periods because of stress, weight loss or something like that..

Ter um bebê é como se fosse planejar uma fantástica e excitante viagem de férias para a Itália. Você compra livros, roupas, faz planos maravilhosos.

EBUCt84Yaa	start ur leave now. and just try to relax|`|2842e23df90fbee0e32380e1af7d286baa	Just remember it is best for your baby to come when he or she is ready.  It's the last leg of the marathon you can see the crowds at the finish line.  Good Luck to you and RELAX!!|`|AA11602698	darling it will be over soon maybe when you go back to your doctor they will do something my daughter went when she was 37 weeks she had been in and out of  labor and delivery 4 times in 3 weeks and was miserable two of her 6 ob doctors got together and  did a c-section on her the baby weighed 8lbs and 12ozes and she has still not recoped from the c-section when she went back to have her staples removed she split open and we have had to keep packing and cleaning the incesion area until they can suture her again so hang in there  GOOD LUCK|`|8u9Vy7dvaa	shh!!! 3 tbs of castor oil  will give you the poops so bad that you go into labor|`|AA10799686	HI there. Oh goodness I know exactly how you feel. I'm 38 weeks and 3 days . (Due April 7th) and I want her out now, i just cant take it anymore. I can maybe give you a 'dishonest' suggestion...When I was pregnant with my 2nd child...my husband wanted to have our son out so badly. I was due on may 17th and that day it was the 17th.... anyway, he sez to me, " why dont you just tell them you fell down the stairs!?" Well I was shocked he said something like that, and ad dumb as it sounds, I done just so. I called the hospital and said I fell down the stairs. they said to come in right way to do a fetal movement test, then they said, "well since its your due date, we shouldnt have to keep you waiting any longer, we will just induce you." thats what we were hoping for (especially my husband) and he came a few hours later. I know it was wrong and I shouldnt have done it, but we couldnt take it anymore. But anyway.. I wish you and your baby the best of luck and CONGRATS!|`|C6hkwBy3aa	Call your Doctor.  The baby will come when he/she is ready!|`|XQLIeB3aaa	I know how you feel. I'm 40 weeks and counting myself. Babies can be born anywhere from 37-42 weeks. Check out webmd.com.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|AA11246351	I know exactly how you feel. I am 39 weeks and last week the dr said I was 2 cm dilated and 80% effaced. I was hoping to have gone into labor by now. My belly itches so bad, I have heartburn that keeps me up all night long, the baby kicks and moves so hard it makes me cry. I have literally flipped out on my husband at least 3 times to the point where he was ready to walk out. I am so emotionally and physically drained that sometimes I think I am going to have a mental breakdown before this baby comes. Unfortunatley there is nothing we can do about it. The baby is the one that triggers labor so if he's not ready he aint coming! I know it is hard. If it gets too bad I would ask your doctor what he recommends. Its not good for you or the baby to be extremely stressed out. Good luck and hang in there soon you will hold your little bundle of joy in your arms and all will be right in the world!|`|MeVhTScSaa	You will make it. Calm down and remember this is the last time you will be able to actually sleep for a few months. You so anxious to get this baby out, you are not taking care of yourself. If your body is stressed, so is the baby. That is not healthy. Think of that too.|`|a0GqnLDiaa	I know this is going to sound weird but my hubby and I had sex one week before my due date (not that just once either) because we heard that sperm could actually make your water break... well it did, problem was Nik WASN'T ready...  After 20 hours of labor and the highest dosage of pitosin they could give me, I never dialated past 9 inches and had to have a c-section.  Sad to say, I wish we'd never had sex that night... I think I really did need another week. ;)|`|eJLjN3quaa	I feel for you and wish you all of the best. I know the end of pregnancy is horrible, I think my husband was ready to move out...lol  Just try to keep in mind what all of this will be for in the end, a beautiful baby. That probably does not help right now, Good luck!
NSGdnxQZaa	Sim, é normal.<br>  <br>  Anticonecpionais podem ter diversos efeitos colaterais, sendo fome em excesso um deles.|`|e60d7243adfdadacd216daba026bab05aa	Aumento do apetite n?o está claramente relacionado com o Diminut, mas "distúrbios gásticos" est?o.<br>  <br>  EFEITOS COLATERAIS do DIMINUT:<br>  Cefaléia, distúrbios gástricos, náuseas, tens?o mamária, sangramentos intermediários, altera??es do peso ou da libido, estados depressivos. Em casos isolados, diminui??o da tolerancia ao uso de lentes de contato.
KQFdvjMvaa	A pílula do dia seguinte possui uma eficácia excelente, contanto que o óvulo ainda n?o tenha sido liberado. Este método funciona igualzinho ao método da pílula anticoncepcional diária, mensal ou trimestral, isto é, impede o amadurecimento do óvulo e, portanto, a ovula??o. <br>  Uma mulher que n?o tem nenhum método contraceptivo que envolva o uso de hom?nios, ovula normalmente.<br>  A resposta seria, sim, a mulher pode engravidar, pois, o óvulo já está amadurecido (ele n?o "desamadurece" com a ingest?o da pílula).<br>  Dias de atraso é um tanto quanto relativo. Há mulheres que regulam após um mês, há mulheres que passam 6 meses desregulada, verifique o seu ciclo.<br>  O teste de farmácia funciona, mas a mulher pode n?o produzir bHCG suficiente, é mais comum do que se imagina, ent?o, se o atraso for maior do que 4 semanas, sugiro um ultrasom, que n?o é falho.<br>  Uma semana de atraso pós pílula do dia seguinte é normal, n?o se preocupe. Aguarde mais uma semana e repita, caso dê negativo até a quarta semana de atraso, fa?a o que te falei, um ultrasom, pois você verá tudinho o que está em seu útero.<br>  boa sorte<br>  bjss|`|ZUDtFGVAaa	Se vc tomou a PDS direitinho, conforme a bula, vc n?o está grávida!<br>  O atraso é em decorrência da desordem hormonal que a PDs causa no organismo. Daqui uns 2 meses, tudo voltará a ser como antes: sua mestrua??o, ovula??o..<br>  Evite tomar a PDS! Só em casos de emergência mesmo!!|`|CjE4burkaa	vc tem que tomar essa pílula no outro dia, pq o esperma fica dois dias dentro do útero do mulher, e um coisa séria, vc n?o pode ficar tomando a pílula toda vez que vc transar n?o, pq é um remédio muito forte e pode desregular o seu sistema feminino todo.|`|NSGdnxQZaa	Sim, é possível. <br>  <br>  Essa pílula tem uma porcentagem de seguran?a bem menor do que a camisinha ou outros metodos anticoncepcionais, usar apenas ela é pedir pra ter problemas posteriormente.
d8ba29916007b972e755a94b166692ffaa	I had 3 miscarriages and after being diagnosed with Anti-Phosphilid antibodies I managed to keep my 4th pregnancy and now have a healthy little girl. <br>  <br>  The eptopic pregnancy must have been very scary.<br>  <br>  You now only have one tube, so only have the chance of getting pregnant every second month.<br>  <br>  That being said, during testing to find out why I was miscarrying I found out that one of my tubes was blocked....and so my chances of conceiving were halved.<br>  <br>  I became pregnant the same month, just a month after my last miscarriage.<br>  <br>  The concern is the 3 miscarriages......have you been for testing?  It is difficult ...and you dont always get an answer.....but I found it much easier to do something rather than just keep trying.|`|pBpBbC8baa	I had 6 miscarriages, the last one being a tubal pregnancy.  That was almost 12 years ago.  Now my fiance and I are trying to have one of our own...he has a 33, 15 and 5 year old.  I have a 17 year old.  My chances are getting slimmer, though, because I am 38 and he is 51.  Have you been to the doctor and been completely checked?  Any scarring on your tubes?  That is one of the top reasons for not conceiving.
N8Ve3DsPaa	I FREEZE during the entire first trimester when I'm pregnant!!!  My blood pressure drops a bit, and all the blood in my body tends to focus on my stomach!  My feet and hands will be icy while my stomach feels almost fevered to the touch :P.<br>  <br>  Be sure to check with your doctor.  Thyroid problems, low iron levels, or other issues could cause you to feel cold.  Most likely, though, it's your body adjusting to the pregnancy--until you have made enough extra blood for the baby, your body will pull blood away from the extremities and focus it on your stomach and core functions (brain, heart, lungs).  <br>  <br>  Congratz on your pregnancy!|`|2184dd96bf7e305613ddd13f9cbeec4aaa	Ask your doctor to check your TSH(thyroid) sometimes hypothroidism can cause cold feet. Or you could have poor circulation|`|8wO9G4mSaa	have you tried wearing socks?|`|O0SDdEtraa	I was a freezer too. Move your feet and legs alot  and wear warm socks.  My hands were cold too.

Good Luck!|`|011552918d0b198dffaf42fff2d8e497aa	Well sweetie let me give you some good advice. Pulling out is not a reliable method of birth control. He can leak before he ejaculates and release some sperm. <br>  <br>  Second off, it *could* be pregnancy related, but it can also be period related. So it's almost like a 50/50 thing. <br>  <br>  My advice to you is to wait about 5 more days and see if your period comes, and if it doesn't, then take a test. Good luck!|`|4fZ1oNlraa	You could be pregnant take a test to be on the safe side and pulling out doesn't help im 36 weeks pregnant and my boyfriend was always pulling out so it doesn't always work|`|AA12015714	First of all, withdrawal is NOT protection from pregnancy.<br>  Yes, you could still very well be pregnant. I would do an OTC pregnancy test and then see a doctor asap.<br>  <br>  Breast tenderness is often an early sign of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  AFTER you CONFIRM you are NOT pregnant, get a prescription for birth control pills/patch/injection. Your current method is totally not guaranteed!|`|eJLjN3quaa	Yes, you could be, there is no such thing as pulling out in plenty of time because of precum. Good luck!|`|AA12029497	hmm, feeling hurt of ur breast and nipples sometimes its normal but then as u said when u get sex ur not using any protection so maybe ur pregnant...<br>  <br>  Buy a PT (Pregnanct Test) at the pharmacy and check urself or go to hospital/clinic to have a check up..|`|purG4Diiaa	It is very likely that you could be pregnant, however don't assume that just because your breasts are sore and you are two days late that you are. I would wait about 4-5 more days and get a pregnancy test. Make sure to get the digital, they are always easier to read. I know during the first few weeks after I found out I was pregnant, it was like all the symptoms hit me at once. Since you have been having unprotected sex, paranoia could be a factor to why your breasts are sore also. Good luck!

74fa2f4290a6abeabea94ad02489b558aa	no sweetie its ok relax kick your feet up and enjoy yourself that is not anything to worry about for months just calm down. Im sure things are gonna be ok with your pregnancy, but if you are worried talk to your dr and see if he or she thinks you are at risk for any problems with this pregnancy.|`|s4Q1MQtHaa	the womb is one of the safest places for a newly developing baby. there is the surrounding amniotic fluid that cushions alot of the every day jolts etc that we inflict on our bodies through everyday wear and tear. you shouldnt be to concerned about baby when sitting that way all though it doesnt sound to comfortable for your back. also, at some point when the pregnancy progresses(God willing) you should be sure to sit with your feet raised to prevent swelling of your feet. even if you are in the office see if you can find a few minutes to stretch out flat and raise your feet somewhere. sitting in a chair for long periods of time can be bad for you back and legs while pregnant so be sure to get up and walk around from time to time as well. Good luck with your pregnancy.|`|d8ba29916007b972e755a94b166692ffaa	NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  No way of sitting will cause stress to your baby......It just might make YOU uncomfortable.<br>  I am sure you are worried about miscarriage after losing your first....but the way you hold your body etc will NOT cause miscarriage. <br>  NOTHING YOU DID MADE YOU LOSE THE BABY. IT`S NOT YOUR FAULT!!!<br>  Think of women who do terrible things to themselves (like throwing themselves down stairs, punching themselves in the stomach etc) trying to lose the baby and   are still pregnant.<br>  <br>  If a pregnancy is going to end in miscarriage, sadly there is very little you can do to stop it either. If it`s going to happen it will happen, no matter what you do or don`t do.
fdff3d3ff3689083b3710374b48e3399aa	Even though our doctor only restricted us for 72 hours after the transfer, my husband and I decided to wait until our first definitive ultrasound after our successful IVF, which was when I was 7 weeks along. We didn't want to take any risks at all. Ask your doctor what is safe for your situation. If you decide to go ahead and have sex, just be gentle.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|4eXNT9mVaa	If your doctor has not put you on pelvic rest, it should be ok.  However, having done IVF myself and knowing the cost and emotions involved, I would be very reluctant to have sex just in case there was a problem.  You only have about another month until you begin your second trimester and I think if it were me, I would wait until then.|`|AA11891829	be patient. is your child to be more important to you or having sex?
vPxCtQHJaa	Bisexual means that person definately enjoys males and females... bi-curious is a description used for someone confused about their sexuality, they are most commonly straight but for some reason are intrigued by the same sex... <br>  Many high school age kids go through this stage|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Bi sexual is enjoying sex with both sexes for ones ENTIRE life.  Bi curious is not sure if they are straight, gay or bi and is still in the expieremental stage.|`|sMa4MhABaa	omg, that sucks, bisexual is when you know that you like both, and bi courious is when you are trying ot find out.|`|74455667f124980a51403ffa72db4cd8aa	How old is your son?  Bi curious is just wondering, like fantisies.  Bisexual knows that you actually like both sexes.|`|dde37d734765be96ae8b61a1c0a5b11caa	Someone who is bi-curious does not identify as bisexual, but has an interest in both men and women to one degree or another. Someone who is bi-curious may identify as heterosexual or homosexual. In most cases, as a heterosexual person.<br>     1. They are contemplating, intrigued by, or otherwise attracted to the thought of crossing the boundaries of their typical sexual orientation and pursuing a romantic and/or sexual relationship with a member of the same sex (if their sexual orientation is heterosexual) or someone of the opposite sex (if their sexual orientation is homosexual).<br>     2. A person is seriously considering identifying as bisexual, but has yet to do so.
