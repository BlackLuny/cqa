N48qV69daa	Why the hell are you changing your last name? Thats offensive to your ancestors, and its just retarded. Seriously, no offense but its true.|`|qVaaaT7Gaa	esquire.....lol    really though i agree with the persson that apparently loves rory|`|mKlQqXMXaa	Genevro...it sounds like Navarro, how's that?
5qIOzchwaa	um, casey tacey you ARE stereotyping.. anyways, it depends on the subtle tones that makes up your face. I look good in black but look better in red. I like using clairol's nice n' easy soft black (maybe it's brown black) it looks really good and doesn't look pure brown when you wash it a couple of months. You should try it.|`|wSMYGzrQaa	Depends what sort of black.. like a soft black is fine but a harsh emo sort of black can sometimes be too much.|`|5I3l7q7uaa	If you are really really pale, it definetely not your colour, but if you some kind of tan or little of olive complection it's right for you.  Having or dying your hair while being pretty pale pale pale will look as you are goth or emo. And I am not stereotyping.|`|6VxPTiCJaa	it looks great on some people, might make you look pale if you have light skin tone. As far as guys go, depends on the guy.|`|MpzmnbCZaa	dont do it youll be like me and cant get it out and i went to beauty school its the hardest color to get out instead try a dark brown or semi permanent..
8Nqq7tkwaa	depends what you are looking for. i know an Athabaskan native in alaska who makes beautiful boots and gloves in the native style and materials. being all hand made they are not cheap but well worth it as the quality is tops.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	For the record, Alaska is a part of America.    The best way to get authentic things of this nature is to travel to that place or try craft fairs in your area.|`|pSYkQQtQaa	I would probably say Alaska?
kLJr3tCWaa	The best mineral makeup in my opinion is Everyday Minerals. Its good for your skin and looks great.  You can actually try a free sample kit EverydayMinerals.com. The kit comes with 3 foundations, a blush, and a concealer (you choose the colors you want)..... and the samples are not as small as you think. You can also keep ordering until you find the rite color that best suites u. You should definitely try it!|`|5f4df7a0d6349251e2eb823b66ee0625aa	i dont think any of the drugstore brands are too good, i'd reccomend pur minerals its like bare minerals except it provides more coverage and it is not loose powder its pressed.|`|OhBbwpPuaa	pur minerals found at ulta|`|t0JWtStpaa	I like Neutrogena.|`|ZcTW0fY2aa	Well, maybeline is getting into that stuff, and I have some. It works great I love it actually. I didn't think it'd work because it was from just the store, but it actually works nice.
PTwgXnauaa	You have beautiful straight hair...i think u should keep them untied and wear a smart warm cap on(as it is winter at your end). HIgh pony tail looks better in summers...un-tied hair is the best style for winters i think.|`|mHGvAc9kaa	Put it in a high up pony-tail and curly the tips  where a scafe :)|`|aqsUNGfEaa	Just like your avatar|`|a7qKKlY7aa	maybe try this heres a video     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGyMPUDRF...|`|39X48cWQaa	part it nicely than comb it down  get a clip and clip the front bit than it will look gr8t
EW1yumzNaa	I've talked to lots of hair dressers about this. And when I got my hair permantely straightened, I found it really didn't damage my hair, it really depends, on what brand of the straightening chemicals and who is doing it that matter, and the strength of them, but I think straightening your hair everyday it much worse becuase it drys out your hair, and gives you horrible split ends|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I dont know I had a perm go wrong and did a box kit to straighten it I fried my hair. Looked like straw.|`|UB6uP4qGaa	a perm can really damage your hair...it really damaged mine...its better to straighten it everyday but use the heat protectant spray =]|`|v0FlUan0aa	straightening it everyday will dry your hair out which will lead to split ends and dry hair|`|vlGHJgtMaa	I think a perm ruins it more. As long as you use heat-protector sprays, hair serums, and stuff like that, straightening your hair everyday won't kill it as much. :] Thats what I do! lol And it works.|`|wSMYGzrQaa	Depends on how your straighten your hair. If your hair isn't that curly to begin with and you straighten it on low heat, then a perm might be worse.|`|R1rVPOdGaa	Um im a black girl and I get perms, I cant put heat to my hair everyday or my hair will fall out, i usually get my hair flat pressed after i wash it once a week. but putting alot of heat to your head can cause wayy more damage.
2yKkNyEvaa	Well I tried baby powder and it seemed to lessen the amount of sweat. But you could ask the chemist (or pharmacy if you live in the US) for a anti bacterial powder he recommends as that may be much better.|`|vgUO4LwZaa	Have u tried ARID XX dry?  I had the same problem until I realized I have to use the dry kind. Whatever type u choose it will  have to be a powder type. Good luck.|`|ab2ced77773506517263df45c8304b30aa	Have you tried the arm and hammer brand it works good for me and yes baby powder will help absorb moisture and if theres no moisture than hardly no smell can build up|`|v9Zv9aGzaa	give it a try it might work|`|91AMtKEraa	lick ur armpit and put shaving cream and then lick that off and then put water that should do it
ZcTW0fY2aa	I saw this commercial where you could get soap for back acne, and I'm sure it's going to be in the aisle where the usual acne products are. Try looking for it, since it's soap you should see improvement.|`|f92f4c895d75cb0a24f4ea612297712eaa	go to the dermatologist
IgCXzbxPaa	Go to a salon or online and get Joico K-pac deep-penetrating reconstructor, I had the same things happening. That stuff is AMAZING use it everyday for a week or so and you're hair will start to feel silky and be shiney like it use to be,but during this time don't do anything chemically to your hair in this time or the results won't be as good. At my cosmetology school we always swore by this after we did a hair project that was going to be damaging. I love that stuff and it smells so good. Also, when you're straightening you hair make sure it's completely dry that always helps.|`|uReFjOONaa	they need triming|`|vlGHJgtMaa	Depending how long your hair is, if it's at least up to your shoulders, trim off about 2-3inches. It sounds like a lot, but it's already dead hair, and is only benefiting you and your hair! :)|`|xlfTPF5Eaa	u should just shave them.  after shave you must grow them with good care  oil the daily  and wash the daily  ok|`|wSMYGzrQaa	Go to a hairdresser, see how much of it you can save, but you will probably have to end up cutting most of it off|`|NXlNuG0caa	have a little bit hair cut every month and it will go healthy again. .  also use vitamine bowl of what ever brand shampoo u use like L'oreal its amazing.|`|5f4df7a0d6349251e2eb823b66ee0625aa	no dont cut it off. i dont think you  need a shampoo for dry hair you need something to repair it like redken all soft or the shampoo and conditioner from brocato    http://www.brocatohair.com/Html/shamp12....    that stuff is miraculous i fried all my hair by bleaching it and i used that for a week and it was starighter and smoother than ever, i really reccomend it, u can find it at any ulta store, and they come in big liters too.
Queccxv9aa	If you go to their website(www.armaniexchange.com), and click "Men", there is a "Sale" tab. It's the far right one. They always have some stuff on sale. I don't know when they'll have a major sale. Usually that stuff happens when they bring in new collections. So, possibly, with the Spring stuff coming in they could be having a sale on some of the older Winter items.|`|AA12133586	they just have their winter sales last month maybe in 3 month or so... right now they are doing 20 off every 100
5qIOzchwaa	you'll look best with darker colors.

It doesn't look purple like the one in ur dress lol you should check it out whenever u buy a hair dye... Since you have  a light complexion it will compliment your skin, esither way if you wanna get a bit color go to a drug store and buy a shade of foundation  (powder)a bit darker not to dark !! Apply it well to kinda like your neck ... Well hope i ve helped.. Goodluck|`|EW1yumzNaa	Your really pretty, and I love your skin tone and hair 2! I thin kyou would look really pretty with a soft brown, and some carmel color highlights, or an aburn color, I would say go for the aburn, it would look best! Good luck!|`|Wqh8t5hVaa	Omg! Ur really preety and u have such beautiful eyes..I'm soo jealous!!    have u tried faketan? It maybe an option if u want to be a lil darker..I think caramel hair with blonde streaks would look soooo nice on you with ur beautiful pale skin! Or maybe honey blonde half head foils to just  lighten up ur base color a lil bit.    I think you look nice with dark hair tho..it makes ur eyes stand out..but they are just a few suggestions    Hope I helped :)

5WP9rLTlaa	Skip the peach, I have similar coloring and it tends to look like bruising on me!  I use a very thin line of dark chocolate or purple eyeshadow next to my top lid, a sweep of cream over the entire lid for day and switch to a shimmery gold or bronze for when I want a touch of glamour. If I wear eyeliner at all it is never black(I get really bad racoon eyes), I use a soft grey or gold instead|`|YEK4dIuGaa	gold  [of course subtle!]  is a great nuetral color for any skin tone|`|AEmD1Mtyaa	A cream colour, like peach. Or a brown, a nice soft subtle brown.|`|t0JWtStpaa	Try a neutral color like peach.|`|aEbuB8Mwaa	light pink, maybe even peach.|`|Gtsvil5Paa	Actually, I was going to recommend brown, and there is a trio of colors that I like by Wet N Wild, shades Belgian Chocolates in Mega Eyes, cost $3.00 in pharmacies and supermarkets.  You can put the top shade in the corner of the eyes near your nose, the bottom color over your eyelid, and the middle darkest shade in the middle of your eye starting from the bottom of your eye lid and smudge it up and out to the outer corners of your eyes.  I put a gold color all over the eye area before I put on the Belgian Chocolates shades.  If you think this is too much for day wear, try a French creme or ecru shade all over the eye area.  The gold color that I use is by Cover Girl called Golden Sunrise.  They may have discontinued this shade, but they have another one in gold albeit brighter called Gold Sizzle.         You could wear blush in a peach shade which is really nice.   A peach eyeshadow in the corners of your eyes near your nose look great, too.           Almay has eyeshadow that you can select according to your eye color.           I also would like to recommend an eyeliner in dark brown or black.  I like Black Coffee by Lancome or any eyeliner by Chanel.  These are expensive, but they are the best.  Lesser expensive ones would be L'Oreal HIP  and Rimmel.           The best mascara is also by Lancome or Chanel,  but I do like 2000 Calorie by Max Factor,  and Cover Girl mascaras.  Always wear black mascara.  Although sometimes I do wear navy, and I am thinking of trying burgundy.

5c48a3d3646aac3d075adfdfcbebb73daa	I prefer fair skin with blonde hair. I agree with you that blonde hair with a tan is heavily played out :P  Besides, untanned skin is far healthier, and fake tans look...well, fake.  Just my opinion ;)|`|iuQ2DBoyaa	Well i had bleach blonde hair ( naturaly ) until i moved to the UK with my family, i dont dye it or anything. I think it will look quite nice.|`|EW1yumzNaa	I agree with you! I hate it when people have like an orangey tan, and then blonde hair, its looks tacky.

c6456e410970b2517c227e433dd2dc3aaa	You could try Sears, or JcPenny or TJ Maxx. I know for sure that you can buy them from Amazon and Bizrate.

7e87b9f7a30f59fd601be09dae6f1a30aa	I have to disagree with the others. I get stys on my eye lids which are basically pimples or clogged oil glands in the eye lids. I definately get them more when I wear eye liner. I have to make sure at night to really scrub my eye liner off very well. It won't cause pimples on other parts of your face though. And only if you are prone to getting stys on the eye lids can you get them.|`|t0JWtStpaa	Its false.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	I've never heard of eyeliner causing pimples, I do know that using poor quality eyeliner can cause infections as can sharing eye makeup. Eye infections HURT.    wearing makeup for too long does cause pimples though, you should not cake it on or wear it for to long, always take it off before going to bed.|`|WSziasfMaa	Since your eyeliner comes in contact with organic material (skin, tears, eyes) every day, it harbors a lot of bacteria.  This bacteria gets on your face and can cause acne.  The best solution is to periodically replace your eyeliner to reduce the bacterial content.|`|ADWIWx5Baa	Lol  I don't think so  It's on your eyes...how can you get a pimple on your eye? :o|`|ZcTW0fY2aa	Well, maybe rubbing the eyeliner on your skin could but other than that, I'm not sure.

I6zQeNGzaa	Jewelry always adds a touch of feminity. Wear silver stud earrings or necklace(s). Look edgy by playing up your makeup.

Abercrombie is a clothing store popular on college campuses and high schools. More expensive than most other clothing stores, (Gap, American Eagle, Old Navy, etc.) yet people still pay for it.     Hollister, owned by Abercrombie and Fitch. Store made to emulate Southern California. slightly cheaper than its parent company, but clothes still expensive for some people.      If you cant say  afford a 15 dollar t-shirt then go to the clearance rack and get it for 10 dollars Hopefully most people can afford that. : D      Hope I helped you.     ' J '|`|CtL4oAZtaa	im not gonna lie I was the kid in all abercrombie and hollister and it had to do with the fact that most of my friends had money and wanted to spend it on brand names.

And thats how I like it and I hate when peope copy it.|`|UEtxG2HYaa	i think it is just because it is the "brand" name. the style stands out compared to other clothing stores. Although the fabric is pretty cheap, i think people just buy it since it is a popular clothing line. If it's popular, Abercrombie/Hollister will be able to sell if for a higher price.|`|8lchebCNaa	i wonder the same thing!  its probobly just because that one persone wore it once and made it look so good that some one else bought it... so on and so forth...  the way they fit is nice too!|`|Uz6OKwGxaa	Pretty much people r startin to go for that style...following others. ..lol..its crazy.|`|WtlpsyfJaa	It's just like anything branded, it becomes popular because it somehow hypes itself up.    I wouldn't be surprised if it was helped early on by some celebrities being seen wearing it... and that's what happened. Then after it became this popular, celbs stopped wearing it and moved on.    I used to wear these brands all the time... and looking back it actually makes me so depressed. Why would I wear something that just makes me blend in so much?! I think the perfume they spray in the store so liberally must brainwash people!!!|`|WRbbpRZzaa	People like to 'fit in' with groups and cliques so they think by buying logo t-shirts, it will validate their status.

And if he likes pink he likes pink. You can't really stop what he wants to do and since it doesn't harm him, then what is the problem? Besides, he's only two. He will probably grow out of this by the time he starts school. Relax, he's having fun with something he can see move with an easy movement. This is normal for a 2 year olds development.|`|WHt2NfGaaa	I never did that but he'll grow out of it with age. The 100% worse thing you could ever do is deny him what he wants as long as it's healthy, but make sure he isn't seen in any of it because then he's in for a long haul of teasing and what not which can hurt his education and have bad self esteem issues later in life.    Be a mom but also be a friend.  Really, Good LUCK!|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	leave him alone...let the kid be a kid and if he's teased, then HE needs to deal with it...(and it doesn't mean he's gay...my brother carried a doll around for 3 yrs as a little boy...he's married now and has kids of his own, he's not gay...)|`|q4EXFhV7aa	He's 2!!!    When he does this at 13, it may be a problem, but at 2, boys love to try on stuff and feel different fabrics.|`|U1juqahIaa	That is normal for his age. I wouldn't worry about it until he gets a little bit older.  He is just curious and likes to explore everything around him.    My little brother used to do the same thing.  He was into make-up and wearing my mom's high heels, my sisters' dresses/skirts and stuff, but he outgrew it by the time he was 5.|`|pfm0wcEIaa	Your 2 year old knows how to put on clothes?    Chances are he has no idea what he is doing.  But the solution is simple: tell your daughter to keep her dresses in her closet and your son should not be allowed to touch her stuff.    Also, he is probably just attracted to the bright colors, in order to redirect his attention, get him something colorful that he likes (a shirt, a toy).|`|5lfnpGmUaa	Buy him a matching hand bag?
c5anDswjaa	Do  NOT ice your ear before you pierce it! That will make your skin tougher and harder to pierce.. Firstly, look in the mirror and see exactly where you want to pierce yourself, it helps it you have a pointed tip pen or marker to place a dot on yourself.. Its also easier if you get a buddy to pierce it for you.. But yeah, get a cork and a sterilized PIERCING needle (cheap on ebay)  that is the right gauge for your jewelry.. Using a safety pin or needle will cause more trauma to your piercing site, they arent as sharp as piercing needles..    But um yeah, look up placements of what you want pierced online to make sure it will be as good looking as it can, get your needle, line it up with your dot, and BAM.. Push it through as fast as you can with the cork behind it..Id let the needle stay in for a few minutes so your body will send its natural painkillers to the piercing site.. Then push the needle out while you put the jewelry in.. And there ya go|`|m6P9BNWFaa	i'm pretty sure that you're supposed to ice your ear first, then put an apple behind it when you stick the needle through. but you seriously should just get it done at a professional place because both ears might not be even... but if you want to do it at home that's fine too.

39bCq7ncaa	gold overlay means the ring itself isnt gold its a different metal but its dipped in gold to make it look that way. Get her what ever you think she likes its the thought that counts, she should be happy with what ever you get her|`|XrcZkt6Haa	Gold overlay means gold plating or coating, means just cover 14k gold at the surface of the other metal, most of the times are cheap metals. The piece won't stand lifetime as the gold surface will wear off after a time of wearing. Try to buy a real 14k gold one or 18k gold ones, which can stand for hundres of years!|`|NWH6SCFqaa	Gold overlay, is Plated! It is gold over some metal most of the time Silver, but not all of the time! Gold overly will wear off over time and need to be re-dipped. I don't know the price but keep looking you should be able to fine real gold at a good deal!     you can check out http://www.youdeservegems.com/index.html... they have 100% real gold and gemstones! Also lots of information about getting Jewelry, its been lots of help to me!|`|jrB6z23Yaa	I would suggest it isn't good. better go for silver.    Dhruvika  http://www.myjewelersplace.com|`|jWmnSXlLaa	NO I would be sooo upset. You can buy  one at a pawn shop or a cheap gold one but make it solid gold.|`|sDHxandWaa	If it's what I'm thinking of, gold overlay is basically gold plating. That means that underneath a very thin layer of gold (which you will see on the outside) will be a different metal underneath, probably stainless steel or sterling silver. If you want something real and somewhat cheap, try white gold.

WSziasfMaa	Wow, time for you to learn some English, Chachi!|`|vzBrloF2aa	You probably walk funny xD|`|22hX0vDNaa	im confused....      well maybe people feel uncomfortable when you stare, thats why they look down. and when a girl sees that ur staring she probs think your staring at her ****.|`|beTBfCkTaa	they probably think its awkward to make eye contact.|`|Ww4wgN41aa	Hmm, either she is shy & timid around you. You have a funny walk, or she is distracted by something.  Answer my question?|`|decWPAHkaa	If you're staring at them without greeting them in passing then these people probably feel awkward that you're staring at them or maybe their shy or insecure.|`|uReFjOONaa	you walk funny|`|CIkD0SfOaa	Some girls are just shy!  Direct eye contact can be very intimidating, especially if you're interested.  A girl may look down to check and see that everything is in order (not nippin' out, shirt straight, fly closed...) or she may just not be interested and doesn't want to give you the wrong idea by looking at you or smiling or giving positive feedback. I guess each situation is different!|`|28r5r6sTaa	No one likes to make eye contact with someone they do not know, especially walking down the street. With girls, they just like to make sure they are looking good, because they have seen a member of the opposite sex and that person is probably looking them up and down. And in case they think you're cute they will avoid your eye contact because they are embarrased.
MA3KcLUJaa	Yeah, all girls do that. and they do that to everyone.  I do that to everyone.   They(well, we) are first looking at you to see if you are cute. Then they will look at you a little longer to make sure they don't know you, so they don't feel bad for not saying hello.  Then they look at their shoes so it won't be awkward because they know that you looked at them, and they don't want you to say anything. Thennn, they will look at their shirt (or sometimes get out their phone and look at it) because they don't want you to think they are just looking at the ground, and so you won't notice.  it's all a phychologic thing.|`|t26ctJdraa	cuz ur so hot they try to act like they didnt notice u|`|dBi78zNraa	attention seeker|`|ZcTW0fY2aa	Dunno...Maybe you're making a weird face when you're walking.

4vqzkIr4aa	I get things like this all the time. First off if you bought a starter kit most likely the machine you got is beyond even being able to be set up properly. Also, one machine cannot function to do all aspects of tattoos. I use 3-4 different machine set-ups when doing intricate pieces: liner, shader, cut-back liner, cut-back shader, etc... each are set up for different things. I give you props for one thing tho, at least you are attempting to discover how to set-up your machine properly before hurting someone.    I first say throw this thing away, make a portfolio of your drawings, and visit a few shops to obtain an apprenticeship. If you do not want to do this and are set on doing it on your own, as most 'scratchers' are, then again throw away the machine you purchased. Go and buy a Fowler machine, easier to set up and tune, or purchase the new Fussion machine which is a pretty good machine and really does not need tuning for basic work. While on the Fowler site purchase his Fowler machine tuning video. Of course this video is not good for all machines because the Fowler line of machines have more adjustment capabilities than most (at least for the inexperienced and not properly trained artists out there).|`|8THz1sp9aa	Then become an apprentice like your supposed to.|`|IllWKAUGaa	apprentice at a local shop or ask to sit in on a few sessions...|`|piIixlJdaa	trial and error    its gonna blow up if you put  things in the wrong place so just  be careful :/|`|rnNn9Ervaa	Get rid of it, now. If you cannot set it up, you are not ready to tattoo, and since tattoos are permanent, you're going to piss someone off. To become a successful tattoo artist, you must apprentice at a shop. Take the tattoo MACHINE (it is not a gun, that right there shows that you do not know the first thing about tattooing) and put it somewhere where you won't be tempted to use it. Then, go out and find the nearest tattoo studio and inquire about an apprenticeship. It may cost a decent amount of money, but if you're serious about becoming an artist, this is the way to go.     Please, do not become a scratcher (one who does shoddy tattoos in their home).|`|fwfT8t4Yaa	I'm with formula  Don't set it up at all...  Do you even have tattoos?   Have you seen how the machine works?  Did you get an Autoclave to clean it in?    Think about the consequences of tattooing someone with AIDS (and they don't tell you they have it, you must assume that EVERYONE has it) then with a dirty instrument tattooing the next person. Warm soapy water just won't make this clean enough to use. pieces of it should have gone straight into and autoclave the second they came out the box.|`|m6P9BNWFaa	simple. you take it out of the box, (u better be doing this while reading along) walk over to the trash can, and DROP IT IN. HUGS NOT DRUGS!|`|WsFH6rUiaa	First of all its a machine nat a gun now my 1911 colt .45 semi auto goverment issue is a gun it goes bang and kills things. The tattoo machine goes buzzzzzz and places tattoo pigment into the skin thust it is a peace of art that makes art.    If u don't know how to set it up and have never done it send the machince back and get ur money back it took me 6 months to get all the setting just perfect on my frist machine. And lissten to miss...the anwser befor mine
vgxeAC11aa	Well, if you're going to stay with the blonde, get the dye, and seeing as it wont match up, just dye all of the blonde and it'll be fine .    If you're going to dye it back to your natural colour, no you shouldn't leave it in longer because it'll damage your hair .    Althoughm what I found was that when I dyed my hair dark brown/ black over the blonde it faded to a greyish colour after a week or 2, so dye it twice in 2 weeks, and you'll be fine .  Oh, but if you're doing permanent dye it should be fine and not go greyish, mine was a semipermanent dye .  Hope I've helped ! :]|`|V4lvmGaoaa	You can always buy dye remover if that helps

BVJBY4eQaa	Old wives tales are a major cause of most repairs that leather technicians go out to fix and hairspray and solvents are the most common. Taking notice of these untested/unproved old wives tales could cost you a great deal of money if it goes wrong.   Just repaired a very expensive jacket that had been virtually ruined by using hairspray to remove ink. It did not remove the ink and left a far worse problem to solve.    Successful ink removal will depend on the type of leather you have, please see the following:    http://www.lttsolutions.net/whatkindofle...    For ink removal:    Ink Removal  Removing ink from leather is not a cleaning problem.  Most ink removal products will not work simply because of the length of time the ink has been on the leather.    Ink is a dye and has re-coloured the leather (this is what it is meant to do)  The longer the ink has been on the leather the harder it is to remove because it soaks into the finish. Once it has soaked into the finish you have to use very strong products to remove it, which will also remove finish and pigment which then need replacing.    Pigment/Protected leather  If the ink is on a pigmented leather then the first thing you should try is an LTT Ink Stick. The fresher the ink the more chance you have of removing it. It is a good idea to have one in your house if you have pale leather and children!!!!     Old ink will be harder to remove than new ink and may mean resorting to solvents which will also remove the finish. This is probably best left to the experts    If an ink stick doesn't work a solvent based remover will need to be used and it may also remove finish and pigment so is best left to the experts.    You should also be using LTT Leather Protect on your suite. This will act like a 'scotchgard' and will make any more mishaps easier to clean off.    You will see many people recommending household products to remove ink  this is not recommended as most simply will not work, some may appear to work but the damage they cause can make a much bigger problem which is then un-repairable (even by a technician)    DO NOT USE THE FOLLOWING:    Hairspray - This is very risky as it can make the matter far worse by spreading the ink over a bigger area and can sometimes then be impossible to fix.   Nail Varnish remover/solvents will remove the finish on the leather even if you cannot tell it is doing so and this will then need replacing, and alcohol may do the same depending on the strength of the finish on the leather.   Baby wipes  just about the worst thing you can use on a leather as they break down the finish and will eventually ruin it.   Milk or Toothpaste - these are just silly ideas that will leave sticky residues on the surface which will help to break down the finish on your leather.   Silicones/furniture polish  should not be used on leather. They will form a coating on the surface of the leather which will not allow any moisture to get to the leather itself and will eventually break all the finish down and cause it to crack.   Hide food will not remove ink and will leave residues on the leather which will attract dirt and oils.   Most leather cleaners will not remove ink unless a very good leather protector has been used on a regular basis.   Magic sponges or erasers (Mr, Clean Magic Erasers). These have been tested by experts in the leather industry and have found to do a lot of damage to certain finish types on leather.    Aniline Style Leather  As aniline style leathers are largely absorbent it means that the ink will have soaked straight into the leather itself. This makes it impossible to remove. No product will successfully remove the ink.     DO NOT try ink removing products on aniline style leathers as most will leave a greasy residue which will then cause another problem.    Because aniline style leathers are absorbent the ink will carry on moving through the leather and may become less obvious over time. Cleaning and protecting will also help to dissipate over time|`|uReFjOONaa	Step  1: Identify the pen mark on your leather couch, designer handbag, briefcase, jacket, etc., and place on a stiff surface or hold taught if it's a couch. (see tips for before treatment options)  Step  2: Lightly rub the pen mark in your leather with the pink Pearl eraser concentrating only on the pen marks. Don't over do it if the mark seems to not be coming out. You could take out the color in the leather or ruin the leather altogether.  Step  3: Once the pen mark is either lightened or gone completely, condition with the leather lotion or other leather treatment.
PQzrsXsKaa	If you had it done at an actual piercing place, not Claire's or something like that, then they usually put in a hoop with a ball in it, not a stud.    If it's infected, taking out the earring will just trap the infection in. Try going back to the piercer (if it was done at an actual piercing studio) and see if they have a different kind of metal they can use. They'll also be able to take out the hoop for you. CBRs, which is probably what you have if you can't get it off, need to be either pulled or twisted apart enough that there is enough space for your ear lobe to fit through.|`|9zYDDCYcaa	First off if it was just pierced there should be no hoop in it. A stud should stay in the ear for around 3 weeks minimum. If it is unbearable i would take it out immediately, Also if it is extremely red! Another thing to consider is the jewelery you are wearing, you could be allergic.

I have blackheads on my chin and nose. I use in this order:    1. St. Ives gentle scrub ( i have really fair skin)  scrub face and infected areas for a few seconds, about 30 seconds.  2. Murad acne cleanser. Scrub until you can feel a cool rush of air on your face ... I know it sounds weird, but it works. You can find it at Peninsula Beauty Supply, and I'm pretty sure you can get just the cleanser. But the starter kit is great too. I'm 16, so I'm kind of in that annoying time period of constant acne problems. Do this process twice a day. I found results in about 2 days. Hope this helps!!|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I use ponds pore strips.

Sometimes it gives them confidence. Some feel they need it. Some wear it so cover up things like scars and zits for example. Alot of it can deal with not feeling pretty enough because of america's view of what the pretty girls look like - those magazines that show you really skinny girls with such clear looking smooth faces.    That kinda stuff really hits a girl.|`|I8teRUk9aa	yeah it shld be banned cuz sm ppl r not allowed to use makeup like me and ppl say im pretty bt ppl who arent pretty also "become" pretty with make up ! its so unfair 4 us|`|WYp4oDRnaa	make up can make a girl feel prettier & have more confidence..  besides, when u start wearing it you feel the need to wear it more often! |`|thme3fxjaa	They are probably self-conscious.|`|69GgJhnWaa	Mainly because the media subliminally implies that in order to be attractive you must appear flawless, which loads of make-up can help accomplish. However, I don't really wear any concealer etc., but I have fun with eye make-up. I just love having fun with all of the colors. Make-up can be very complimentary and natural when done correctly.|`|wuZt4pDHaa	I'm not sure, I don't think it has to do with character or anything like that. I personally don't wear makeup but do know the appeal of it. Just because a girl wears makeup doesn't always necessarily mean she's not confident or she wants to "cover" something up and wear a ask and be fake. Whatever reason the girl decided to wear makeup for is her own thing, it doesn't mean she's fake or anything.|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Its a girl thing you obviously don't understand coz you're a guy.     But let me fill you in: girls want to look their absolute best at all times.  And besides, its fun applying makeup =D
2LDtSDMuaa	i think oval...?|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	round|`|WSziasfMaa	oval/heart-shaped|`|3m4YrL8qaa	like oval with a square jawline...me too!  I love ur eyes|`|1hlIzEnTaa	Square!|`|p3GZERIsaa	Oval but with square jawline, pretty :]|`|7kF26l4jaa	square-ish pointy-ish|`|69GgJhnWaa	I would say either a heart or square. To be sure, google face shape measurements and they should give you measuring instructions that will determine your face shape.|`|gkxb5OwHaa	i'd go with heart.|`|I8teRUk9aa	its definitely heart shaped|`|okZW8Ld5aa	Its heart shaped|`|AA10842205	You have a very pretty face. The best style you could get for your face shape would be short. I am thinking just below your chin but above your shoulders,layered, with bangs that go off to the left side of your face. You would look awesome.   I would love to see pics of whatever style you choose. Good luck!|`|PjzJ9QQRaa	I would say square or heart shaped.  You remind me of Tiffani Amber Thiessen.  You should check out this site, it has some of her styles.  Also it has a cool program that you can upload your picture, and try different celebrity styles to see what looks the best!  Hope you like it.    http://www.beauty-and-the-bath.com/Tiffa...
YEd9Q5KZaa	I think you should try it for a bit longer. It may have gotten worse because it's a different type of cleanser than you used before right?|`|Cu0fPcdnaa	neutrogena sucks it made my break out buy another thing  that cleanser is so chemical try kiss my face is way much better then that s..t|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	I think that you should give it about a week. Sense sometimes things make it get worse before it gets better! Good luck though.|`|K0GTAH8Paa	i know dude that stuff sucks!    it totally made my skin much worse..    so i switched to just Acne Free, its a three step product, and its been working. but it is a hassle.|`|8osMkLe1aa	The cleanser itself won't cure your acne, but it is good for getting rid of the excess oil. Don't bother buying a medicated cleanser. They don't work very well because the medication is only on your skin for a short time and then you rinse it off. You should keep using the  Neutrogena cleanser and use a benzoyl peroxide cream as well, at night. I recommend Oxy Lotion Vanishing Acne Medication.
eZY40P20aa	Then brown, bronze, golden, yellow (but light one), white will be perfect! if u want you can even add a accent of blu....or lilla....(but its better blue xD)    Remember to extend white eyeshadow on the little corner at the starting of the eye: it will make your look light up  While at the out of the corner use a dark colour to give deepness to your eyes    BUT look: before doing all that use a basic eyeshadow for all the eye, so the resolt will be very much better^^      At the end remember to use a golden foundation cream for your skin       KISS^_^|`|dBi78zNraa	GOlden or golden/blue|`|QMnoPj0zaa	try All That Glitters eye shadow by MAC, it's great. a neutral that goes with everything, but i think will compliment champagne the best
f4612bc7100eeec26227842ca88b15a8aa	I think any girl looks much better with super long hair.    It's so rare to see a girl with hair down to her knees.  When you do, it's just amazing.  Of course if it's in good condition, even better.|`|WSziasfMaa	Its really gross.  I just start thinking about the bad shape their shower drain must be in!|`|3cCunajcaa	well most people ive seen with REALLY long hair dont take care of it like they should so i dont care for it.|`|1hlIzEnTaa	It doesn't usually suit them|`|YEd9Q5KZaa	I always want people to cut that **** off.|`|TzVdAFEpaa	Depends how well it's been taken care of. Generally it looks like its dry and damaged at the ends, and the weight of it really makes it flat and lifeless.. so most of the time I don't care for it too much. However once in a while someone may have really healthy, shiny hair and I think it can be pretty.   Either way, I always think what a pain the maintenance must be...|`|vgxeAC11aa	I think the longest it should be is the middle of your stomache, any longer than that and it starts to get scraggle and unkept, even if the person takes good care of their hair .    When I see someone I always think 'Why do they want it so long ? It must be a pain in the *** to wash and brush etc. etc.'|`|I8teRUk9aa	wen they tie it, it looks like a horse's tail|`|Zg1ih6gcaa	I like long as in all the way down the back but beyond the butt is a little bit too much.  I guess my first thought is usually "What a pain to wash all that!"|`|YoK7G6YFaa	Get  a flippin haircut. Haha, jk... long hair is really pretty, ya know, if it's cared for well.|`|YSmYkc5Yaa	It doesn't usually look good because most people with long hair don't look after it.    However, I did go to high school with a girl who kept her hair in amazing condition, and it reached the top of her butt. It was absolutely beautiful. And it looked great on her because it was so healthy and shiny.    If you're going to have long long hair, you have to look after it so it doesn't go all gnarly. But it can be done because I've seen it.|`|F8OrjeWsaa	i personally wouldnt do it.   i think when it gets to that length, its disturbing. i wouldnt want to defend anyone by saying its gross but...it is a little creepy and ive never seen someone with super long hair that actully looked nice.|`|GlB06CzBaa	surge, your always on my mind, i love you and dream of having sex with you!! grow your hair forever!
bITTzzcVaa	It is very unlikely they are age spots.  Freckles can be any shade they want to be.    Look at the freckles on your body, are they all the same color?   Of course not!    They are probably freckles, and nothing to be worried about.|`|EY2uwkHbaa	I don't think it's very common. The melanin in your skin is probably just uneven, it gets like that if you've been in the sun longer than usual or you've been tanning recently. maybe that's it, my friend had that. Then there's that condition that Michael Jackson claims to have, forget what it's called, but it's a loss of pigment. I wouldn'e worry about it. Use lotion on them, the kind with a touch of tanner.
24cUKZDgaa	the only one i "like"  is the last one , that dress is fairly pretty.  The others arn't very "vintage"  And i don't like them much.|`|AA11732565	Hate the plaid coat - just not my style.  If the top on the red dress was fitted, it would look great (you could wear higher heels too).  Black dress is very very cool!|`|ZZJKTV8laa	i like them all except the first one and the shoes all arent that great. i love the top in the second picture|`|45ebb5bbacc3ca429fdca620b42e84c0aa	LOVE...LOVE...LOVE.... LOVE.... THEM...|`|KncPJwIaaa	I LIKE WHATS IN THE OUTFITS|`|dkqlW0A0aa	Yes. Except 3 because the coat looks puffy to me.|`|pxLV3Tppaa	I like the 1st one and the 3nd one|`|WOBAN2iqaa	I really like the first and second ones!!! the last one's ok but it doesnt fit right and the jackets ok but it does nothing for me|`|vqbieczAaa	love them.
9RTuRPviaa	Ears are pretty safe to do yourself. I did my own with a needle ( 4 holes in each ear...also did my own cartilage) and i never had any problems.   Just numb it with ice if you want. Let the needle sit in rubbing alcohol for a couple minutes before you start and clean it again before you do the other ear. Put studs in when you're done (don't use cheap ones in case you're allergic) and don't take them out for at least 4 weeks (i think i left mine in for 6 weeks).  I wouldn't do my own nose or lip though, there is more room to mess up there.|`|YEd9Q5KZaa	Don't even do it.|`|7kF26l4jaa	yea you should be ok  i peirced my lip and both ears by my self  gun on my ears  needle on my lip  as long as you keep it clean you got nothing to worry about    make sure you do it straight!!! ^^|`|xy4z8bQraa	ear is no problem to do just put it through, nose is another issue altogether, hit the wrong nerve and you will lock up all the muscles in your face permanetly.|`|WOBAN2iqaa	I pierced all my ear piercings myself when I was 16.... and they're still there. If you are like me and dont like needles just get a surgical steel stud and push it through. Dont go slow cos it bleeds and hurts. Do it fast and you will hear it pop through the cartilage. Put the back on and dont touch!!! dont take em out for a while and if they do get infected savlon cream works really well. Goodluck
n1y67ZNuaa	if you want me to streotype you id sayaverage kid,who likes the look of scene.    but whyd u wanna b sterotyped n e ways|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	You are in high school and want to be different but yet you are pretty much just like a lot of highschool girls your age...|`|u653DtGGaa	emo|`|8sPS24cmaa	strange.|`|thme3fxjaa	Why would you want to stereotype yourself?.|`|jTkX9HJyaa	What stereotype am I?|`|WHt2NfGaaa	typical fat girl trying to fit in.    Reasoning: it's overly typical and kinda sad.    Preppy/Trendy is fine but being fashionable is true beauty. That means not what you see at some dumb mall but what you see at Saks or Lord & Taylor...people who honestly care about how they think of themselves and how they want the world to think about them. Thats the key, what do you want other people to see?
NqZFw3izaa	pain depends on your own personal pain tolerance..  the belly button has been my most painful piercing so far.. but it's not horrible..  i'll say the actual piercing was a three.. but the healing time was a six..  keep in mind that the healing time often hurts more than the actual piercing.. during healing it's swollen and irritated.. it aches.. and it really, really hurts if you catch it on something.. like your pants..   but yeah.. it's not insanely bad..|`|AA11367983	If the person who is doing it knows what they're doing it shouldn't hurt at all.. i'd say pain-wise it was mayb 1-2/10.. it's over before you really feel it, think getting your ears pierced..  You would feel a quick and short pinching sensation, that's about it.|`|NkX50RHFaa	My sister had hers done and said it didn't hurt that it was more like a really sharp pinch.     But one of my friends had hers done and vomited from the pain haha    All i know is that i've got seven piercings and none of them hurt majorly except having my vertical labret re-pierced cos they had to go through scar tisssue, anyway hope i haven't scared you.     Go for it if thats what you want lol|`|l9jIAeo4aa	people have different reactions to pain. remember to eat prior to getting your belly pierced, oh and also the more you worry about it the more nervous you will be, and it might cause you to tense up or shake nd your piercing might turn out crooked :P relaxxxx it will be fine, 10 seconds of pain is worth it for something that lasts :)|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	6. Don't do it. You will waste your money only to find out that it WILL get infected.|`|q7I1Ek3kaa	they say that the skinnier your stomach is (the less skin there is to be pierced) --it hurts more    the more little extra skin or fat around your belly button and stomach ..the less painful its supposed to be    but who cares about the pain, its only temporary! :)|`|gkxb5OwHaa	it doesnt hurt. seriously. its just like getting your ear hurt. but if you go in thinking it'll hurt like hell like i did, it wont hurt like hell so it wont be painful. just think itll hurt and it wont. id give it a 4.|`|bITTzzcVaa	it seriously depends.  mine hurt like a b****!  but then my friend who did it after me didn't even flinch.    its all about your pain tolerance.|`|KxAmrVBfaa	Get numbing cream..    I got my belly button pierced about 3 years ago and i absolutely hate needs but I wanted to get it done    So I got numbing cream from a pharmacy costs about $20 for a small tube..and u apply it wait and hour and hey presto..you cant feel a thing
C0HZ8ZB4aa	No, they don't have glittery tattoo ink.    And siggie, that's absolute rubbish. It's very amusing when people make fools out of themselves by pretending to sound knowledgable about something they clearly know zero about, but why do you do it? Black light ink is not at all the same as white ink. White ink shows up very clearly on skin in white light (until it inevitably fades over the years, at which point it's ability to glow under UV light also fades). Black light ink can be completely invisible in white light and only show up under UV rays, or there are coloured varieties available which show up coloured under white light and glow under UV rays. But neither of these varieties of UV ink is the same as white ink or any other ink traditionally used in tattooing. As for whether or not it's carcinogenic - that's neither proved nor disproved, and there is a great deal of question over it. There has been a great deal of health advice from various institutions over the years not to use it, for this reason, but there are arguments from the other side that it is totally safe. I, for one, will not be taking the chance with my health, particularly as it's only a relatively new thing we cannot see the long term effects yet, we will know more about it in 50-100 years time when we can see what, if anything, happened to the people who had these tattoos - but that's your decision to make.|`|XrMMH5tZaa	ha no     and black light ink is just white ink, cause anything white glows in blacklight  so its not cancerous|`|rnNn9Ervaa	No, they don't. I would imagine that it would be forever painful. I mean, tattoos themselves are mildly painful, but having glitter in your skin forever sounds insanely uncomfortable. The most outrageous tattoo ink out there is black light ink, and from what I hear, it's cancerous.|`|UwD4Gk3Uaa	No but you can get like little shiny piercings put in your skin for like eyes and stuff and it looks cool.   I cant remember what it's called though D=
2LDtSDMuaa	they're pretty common, and not too whore-ish unless you show it to everyone all of the time.  they're cute though.|`|fRkZLEX5aa	They're great ^_^.|`|WyQuDaRyaa	I like them. I have mine done. ``)|`|K07hctlMaa	cute :)|`|w8oe19udaa	they're super sexy, which is why i got my belly pierced :] some people say they're slutty/trampy but i thinks there's a certain level of sophistication to a pierced belly button.|`|SLmLGwnNaa	Cute!   I've had mine done for about 8 years.... & although I don't show it much anymore, I still wouldn't want to take it out!|`|YEd9Q5KZaa	Many of you said that you don't like tongue piercings but having your naval pierced is okay? Why? Cause every god damn female has her bellybutton pierced?   Well, I prefer them on guys actually.|`|gkxb5OwHaa	love them. theyre great(:
R1uFA7nKaa	I love em.  I've had my labret pierced for 8 years now and soo happy I still have it!|`|gkxb5OwHaa	snake bite studs on guys are sooo hot.  but anything else...not so much.|`|UzZyxTtEaa	They make you lips look fat.|`|vgxeAC11aa	I haven't seen anyone with a lip piercing for ages .  I think they look really good, but I don't really like the ones in the middle of the bottom lip .  Only a handful of people can get a lip piercing and look good .|`|5NsgLFPRaa	Overrated  :/  they're getting too popular for poseurs
fRkZLEX5aa	Hate them|`|YEd9Q5KZaa	Yes yes yes. I want one. How the hell can it look slutty? Seriously, just because it's a  piece of metal in your mouth you're going to assume that someone ***** around like that? So do braces make people slutty?|`|LoKFXWFzaa	They look cool.  They're not just about sex. They're like any other piercing--people get them  because they like how they look. Whether or not they can be used as a sex aid has nothing to do with whether or not people want them for their looks.|`|K07hctlMaa	slutty|`|dZtToTIbaa	I guess I'm a slut then. I've had mine done for over a year now and I love it and don't care what any of you b*tches think!|`|8Y9EogN0aa	i would never go for that. i don't want a woman that looks like she's running a hardware store on her face.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	i think they are awesome. and i agree with !  having a piece of metal on your body does not make you a slut. i got my tongue pierced and i dont do that stuff, some people get tongue piercings just because they look cool. you cant judge a book by its cover.  (and this isint direceted at the poster its at the ignorant people replying saying they are slutty)|`|gkxb5OwHaa	it's a sign that you've given head...if you have it.  so yeah, i'd go with slutty.
YEd9Q5KZaa	Well, it depends on your skin type. I've been using Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash for about a week, and it has been good for making my skin smooth and I have very little acne, however I don't have an even toned complexion yet. I'd suggest it for sure.|`|AA11705009	For men and women and you will see results...at a fair price, even with a discount if wanted.  http://www.arbonnefc5.com/home/|`|gt58XQF3aa	Clinique. You can find different washes, toning solution and moisturizer's to fit your need's.     The great thing about when you go to purchuse, the sales represenative for this product will evaluate your skin to see what would suit your need...|`|edAtsw3waa	Please do not waste your money on over the counter products, they may seem to work but they are actually damaging the skin internally and ageing it faster.    The best products are the professional brands that come from Salons or Dermatologists. They have the best ingredients and even though they are expensive you will save money instead of spending money trying to reverse the affects of a cheaper products.     Dermalogica is a great choice, it certainl cleared up my acne. Thalgo also has a great range for men.     Remember that the skin will get worse before it gets better and full results show up after 3 months so please do not be dettered and stop using them! It pays off!
NLxcfGplaa	Hold hands when you go out together.  Sit closer together|`|N5qx5NUvaa	Why is this in the makeup section?|`|Uz6OKwGxaa	well it would b hard 2 think of him as ur bf if u been friends for 2 years...do things u havent dun w/ him b4...make it feel like a relationship...like hold hands...lol or sumthin...do things u both like for fun...|`|ceF5X2m7aa	you should do it..
pxLV3Tppaa	he looks kinda gay : /|`|n1y67ZNuaa	nah not gay.  too old for me to rate.|`|qag0plj7aa	i think nothing much of him actually|`|utKU3xXIaa	I think hes you too and you look like just some dude with a gay tie on.|`|1IIY1Ds6aa	i think hes you, and i think hes a creepy perv!!!!|`|WHt2NfGaaa	he doesn't look gay at all but he'd look a lot better if he shaved his face...that's making him look ugly (no offense!)
Egwx81xoaa	I don't wear it but I have smelled it before in a magazine and on some people and I honestly hate it.  I am very sensitive to perfumes, and Angel is such a strong, spicy scent it gives me headaches and makes me nauseous. :(  I wear Dior Pure Poison. :)|`|xMGUDenDaa	I have smelt it before on people it smells good  I like Daisy by marc jacob and Be Deliciou by DKNY|`|709ec5c25d079ea91e475faad742895daa	My ex wears it, and I have to tell you from a guy's point of view....I just love it.|`|6zFHONu6aa	I do and i am a big fan!  I can safely say it is by far my favorite perfume, yet i do feel like i am the only one who wears it....  The smell of it is so unique and yes like you i always get complements.  x|`|mzMOpQhvaa	I get totally positive responses, too! Noone comments on anything but it. It works really well with certain chemistrys. It's definitely a 100% hit or miss on those who wear it! :D
PvpBYK9raa	the first one, bright pink :)  its a gorgeous colour, pink really suits blonde people. and its modest, but sassy :) and olive skin and bright pink go ah-mazing together :) get a black waist belt (the ones that sit under your cleavage) too, so the shoes will match something     seriously, your fiance is gonna love it ;) and oh, congrats on getting engaged ! have fun ! :D ?    edit: the shoes are stunning too, and the pink underneath would compliment and suit the first dress :)|`|AV0eejfLaa	I like the a Herve Leger dress best my friend has a white one similar to that one a halter style it's awsome i like the shoes also|`|38cc8157846426266baa6afc6d5ab186aa	The second if you have a good, long neck and slim arms, the Leger otherwise. If you're wearing the first, you must wear a black belt or carry a black clutch, otherwise the black shoes will look odd with your hair.     Both dresses are lovely! Enjoy Valentine's!|`|kOlZqhSdaa	If you can get the milk for a price of a meal, why buy the cow?|`|wY2k1cHVaa	The 2nd dress has a really nice figure-flattering shape! It would look really cute if you wore a shrug or cardigan sweater over it =]    The first one if more casual, but i dislike the metallic stripes on it. Still a nice dress if you like it though!    LOVE the shoes! Simple but they'll look really good with the dress.   Now just get some accessories and you're set!|`|oLzOwpfWaa	the first one because the second one will make you look like you have a belly no matter how skinny you are because of where the pleating is|`|tdGR6Qunaa	the pink one. it can be a lot more slimming and it doesnt have of the those things like on the other dress that take the eyes off the body. The shoes are great|`|iQ5ms1fgaa	I like the second one a lot. I like the color, the first one I think would be too much of a contrast on your skin. I love the pale 50's style pink also, so you might like to check that out as well. But the style of the second dress is so cute. Very curve hugging. I LOVE IT:)|`|UwbPfJacaa	I like the first one better :)  And those shoes will look amazing with it too.
qsjGiaW2aa	No its not fake. Coach products are made in different places depending their materials, style, ect. Most are made in China but I also have a wallet made from India. You can take it back and they'll tell you the same thing.|`|5ph71VMvaa	In a sweet shop in the center of the earth.|`|c78mAitdaa	You should be able to find where they are made by looking for a label saying if it is washable or what it is made out of, and at the bottom it should say.     I don't know about wallets but my mum has a coach handbag and it is made in China.     I should think the wallets would be the same...    :)|`|BQY6itt6aa	china , at least mine is . But if you bought it from a coach store , then dont worry about it|`|f5R5BPTDaa	I have two of their finest purses that my grandmother bought in Europe  8 years ago. They cost $200 for the same purse that is $400 here.|`|18c68470068fcbd9d1dcca3fcbc147d7aa	i think china usu...or any other poor country.|`|R1rVPOdGaa	Asia|`|9ecd63ac64510601e036cd47ad4d1561aa	All coach products are made in China. Since I don't know exactly what wallet you are referring to, It's possible someone bought one then returned it for a refund but actually returned a fake one, or maybe some of the materials were from India. Stating such as "man made materials from India" but the overall product would have been assembled in China.|`|OGLulBtwaa	They go where ever the the labor is cheapest at the time.

CEkxWCwXaa	When you get your tongue pierced, make sure they piece it with TITANIUM: it's slightly more expensive than the standard stainless steel, but a helluva lot better for you. Do not get it done with real gold, firstly because it's so expensive, and secondly because it contains nickel, which may cause reactions.    If you go to a professional piercer, the chances are that it is very safe. Make sure that they're official, maybe if you have a friend who has their tonuge pierced, ask where they got their's done. But remember, don't always go for the cheapest place: sometimes it's better to pay that little extra bit to make sure you're getting it done by a pro.     Tongue piercings are very safe. I've swallowed like, 5 of my tongue balls, and I'm still alive! But if you inhale them (breathe in and it goes down your wind pipe), that's when it might get dangerous, although very rare. My advice to prevent this from happening is to buy a set of rubber latex gloves (it's like, $3 for a pack of 100), and every few days, tighten the balls on your tongue bar.    Infections are very rare with tongue piercings, seeing as it is surrounded by anti-bacterial saliva. They only take two weeks to heal, too. So the chances of something going wrong if you go to a pro piercer is slim to none.     You CAN bring your own jewellery, but I strongly strongly suggest getting titanium. The only piercing I didn't get with titaniun got infected.    EDIT: I forgot to add. If you bite down on your tongue bar hard, you can chip your teeth. This will usually not happen if you're careful, but if you're worried about it, two weeks after getting your tongue done, go back to your piercer and ask about getting a bioplast bar. Bioplast is plastic, and does not normally cause reactions, but because it's plastic, you won't chip your teeth!|`|HjNU9WZYaa	well i'm sure you could bring your own, but you might want to talk to the piercer and ask him/her. If you have a problem with metal, try asking if you can use plastic. :)|`|g5b7OSYcaa	I don't think you can bring in your own. Piercing shops where I live won't allow it. The reaction will most likely be worse considering your mouth is sensitive. I've had my tongue pierced, and I completely regret it now. It wore my teeth down where the ring would always hit them. And I had to get that fixed. That goes with any piercing of the mouth. Hope this helps hun.|`|ArtZwIbvaa	You will probably not be able to bring your own as the piercing studio will need to autoclave the jewellery to make it sterile.  The jewellery they used will be a non reactive metal anyway, titanium or surgical steel, which you are very unlikely to be allergic to.  Ask the piercer what they will use before you have it done and explain your situation so that they are aware.    If you go to a reputable piercer and follow the correct aftercare instructions there is no reason why you should have any problems with this piercing.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Tongue piercings are as safe as any other piercing, with one exception: You run the risk of tooth and gum damage, which can be pretty expensive, if not impossible to fix. A good piercer will be able to work with the placement and get you properly fitted jewelry to minimize the risks, but damage can happen even with the best tongue piercings.    You have to follow the after care instructions to the letter to make sure you don't end up with an infection, which includes abstaining from any kissing or other oral activities for at least 8 weeks.    The jewelry that piercing artists use should be implant grade stainless steel or titanium. Very few people have any sort of reaction to either of these, but there is small amounts of nickel (the metal in costume jewelry that most people react to) in stainless steel, so if you are concerned, ask for titanium.    You will not be able to bring in your own jewelry. It needs to be the proper size (which is not the same for everyone) and material.  It also needs to be sterile. Most artists will have a few different pieces for you to choose from, although the initial barbell will probably just be a standard one (It gets switched out by your artist after about 2 weeks anyways)|`|LoKFXWFzaa	Shops use surgical steel. It's used in surgery because it's not reactive. After it heals, you can also use titanium.    You can't bring your own jewelry to a reputable shop, because its sterility cannot be guaranteed. And you don't need to, because a reputable shop has sanitary surgical steel jewelry.    I react to sterling silver, any costume jewelry, and all the jewelry marketed as hypoallergenic. I have to wear gold or surgical steel earrings. But I have my tongue pierced with surgical steel and have had no problems. It healed well--saliva is a natural cleaning agent and the tongue heals rapidly. I use acrylic beads to minimize risk of tooth damage. I've bitten the beads several times without injury. But you do have to take care of the piercing with proper aftercare; if you're careless and get an infection, it's serious.|`|bITTzzcVaa	use a tongue ring that is made of REAL gold.|`|qag0plj7aa	mine has been pierced a year now, and they pierce it with surgical steal, its what they use in surgery. yeah im allergic to alot of metals and have to use hypo allergenic jewelry, your best best is to leave it to the pros and let them use their equipment, cause there is a special ring they use for piercing other than what u can buy your self.|`|AA10915534	Try it ....... its cool !!      Btw, its not for a "while" its 4 always.  U may remove the ring later but not the poke.      Try Gold ... it'll help

2XTkSV4daa	No I don't think so but your friend better not do it again because...  (1) Writing those essays now will give you good practice for writing all the essays you will need to write on the SAT, etc, to get into a good college.  (2) Someday soon it will become serious.   (3) You can learn a lot more if you just take the time to write a good essay and it can be fun too!    Hope this helps|`|vUHwKh1Iaa	no its just away to scare you nearly everyone in my school plagarises and nothing has happened to them. The teacher didn't even notice!!!!!!|`|DNLJwLZqaa	Nahh. It's like the state tests, they DON'T look at them in middle school. and they barely glance at them from high school.    don't worry about it. and if they ask her about it in an interview for college, she can just say that she was stressed and stupid and it was five years ago.?    but they won't ask.|`|lvAEDKPBaa	It could but probably won't.

I have that same problem. I don't hardly grow pimples ANYWHERE ELSE ON MY BODY. Just the TIP OF MY NOSE!!! It's so dang annoying!  There's no magic remedy. If you're in a bind, you can stop by a drug store and pick up some "Concealer" in the make-up department. It won't kill the pimple, but it'll cover it up.  For overnight kill, you should buy some "Zap-It" Acne treatment. Or something like it. They're all in the same section. They all contain the same ingredient. I think Benzynol, or something?? Anways, it really does kill the pimple overnight. Works great. Problem is, you have to use it consecutively for a week or so, or the pimple will come back!  Ok then. Peace!!!|`|TBPkk6QKaa	Ice the pimple to reduce swelling and redness  put a pimple medicine on it later or pop it|`|AA10915534	Try colgate at night & it;ll help      Also try clearsil or any acne remover pencil  Thats help within 24 hours|`|X8gIe9Tqaa	use vinigar or lemon juice to pop it. put it on before bed and it should have reduced by the morning|`|1hlIzEnTaa	Do NOT use toothepaste!! That's ridiculous, it might make it appear less red, but so will visine! if anything if will just irritate it more and clog the pores, not going to help it go away! Clean and clear has a really good spot treatment (invisible) works like a charm, only thing to watch out for is it can really dry that spot out, so moisturize as well or you may have some peeling!|`|EY2uwkHbaa	omg i hate that :( yeah, putting toothpaste on it overnight is a good idea- make sure it's the white kind. but it's the sort of thing that you just have to wait out... :( and don't pick at it!! unless you see a white tip, don't even touch it.|`|NqZFw3izaa	crush up an aspirin with a drop or two of water and make a paste.. then leave it on overnight..   if it's not totally gone tomorrow, it should at least appear smaller after a night or two..
uX5hO3d8aa	It all is based on personal preference.    I'm 19 and I remember 10 years ago baggy jeans were the style. Skinny jeans were for kids who's mommas picked out their clothes. The huge, baggy fad has died (thank god) and now it comes down to whether you prefer loose fit/relaxed fit or tight fitting jeans.    My personal favorite style combines the two: low rise boot cut. Levi, American Eagle, and a number of major brands make this style. Usually they fit tight through the butt and thighs and looser on the lower legs. And they don't rise up too high around your waist which to me is much more comfortable and I think it looks sexier when I take my shirt off.     For 13 it really doesn't matter. At 23 it doesn't matter either, as long as you're not trying to rock the whole emo look (I can't stand that). If you look good and feel good you're gold in my book.|`|04rQEJQfaa	skinny jeans deffinatly, even if you were 23 it wouldnt matter lol

So 5'9 in cm is about 175.26     175.26/100 x 15  = 26.289    A size 10 shoe is approximately 26.82cm long (if we are talking Australian and American shoe sizes), so yes, you are perfectly normal!|`|xMGUDenDaa	sound normal|`|j6RDbnl6aa	nope.  they are fine for your height.  i wish i were near your height.|`|QD9PqnJ1aa	It is quite normal.

uVRU1uItaa	First of all the day, you have to separate the hair when washing it, especially on the roots, that's where a lot of the shampoo/conditioner is left over. You have to part your hair and rub your hand through the roots to really get rid of that left over shampoo/conditioner. I was sometimes in a rush and would do my hair really fast and then miss checking the roots, I'd dry it and when I'd be out after a short period of time it'd look oily and greasy, and pretty thick and not very nice to rub your fingers through, not forgetting the knots it causes if left. So just wash thoroughly and I'm sure they'll be corrected.    Also don't wash everyday! do it every other day. Washing everyday causes the natural oils in your skin to come away, meaning it leads to more itching and more horrible sores when you itch them. Same thing for the scalp, the more you wash it, the oils come out and you're left with a flaky itchy scalp, I had the same problem.    For the dry hair itself use an extra squeeze of conditioner, always have to use more conditioner as this is what gives it the soft feel and shine.    For the scalp, this has no doubt happened because you're showering everyday, limit your showering to every other day, ie: wash monday, miss tuesday, wash wednesday and so on. This doesn't mean you're dirty or you're to be looked on as something different. If you require to clean places then just get yourself some water, a sponge and do it that way, this way it isn't taking the oils out of your skin, if any it's to a minimum.    I recommend also you get some 2 in 1 or separate products (shampoo and conditioner) ANTI DANDRUFF. This stuff is a little different, smells quite nice and does the job, sorted my hair out no problem.    If things get worse even with my advice, then go see your GP or local dermatologist. I hope I've helped.    Good luck.|`|TGMUFytraa	Wow, too long. I didn't even finish reading it.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	I've always had long hair too and dry scalp and dandruff sense I was a kid.

It doesn't sound like  you need to go to a dermatologist. Some people just have really sensitive scalps. Do some research to find out  what the best kind of hydrating shampoo and conditioner is. I think my friend used Head and Shoulders. Ask your mother to purchase some produce to see what helps you. It would be cheaper than seeing a doctor.|`|KEbn0z4uaa	i currently developed a scalp issue and got help for it!!! use HASK it's in a clear bottle and it's an orange solution and it says HASK in white letter u can buy it in Sally's beauty supply store!  it really works and it's eassssy to apply and it's unoticable!!! i suggest u don't use conditioner and change shampoo to nuti-ox shampoo helps repair hair makes it look healthy.   good luck
EepiLrmZaa	romans cut their hair short. we can see this from busts of caesar. the length of a mans hair goes in and out of style. my hair has gone through many changes since the 50s. I have never had a mullet either. LOL|`|W1vdfn1yaa	when they figured out it wasnt such a pain in the *** to have it short|`|1hlIzEnTaa	don't tell me you're still rocking the mullet..
YjkXyHBuaa	depends on the salon.  the better ones usually charge about $100 per process.  and bleaching generally takes more than one process. :[|`|uVRU1uItaa	Depends what type of salon you go to, I live in England but I guess the prices are pretty similar.    If you go to your local professional salon they might be able to do you a good deal, my girlfriend went to one and got her hair bleached and colored for 25 pounds (roughly 50 dollars) and she was there a good while, so not too bad.    If you go to one of the well known about professional salons, they tend to take advantage of their status and bump their prices up, but this doesn't mean they do a better job necessarily!    Look around a bit, ask in a few places and I'm sure you'll get a great deal.    Another alternative is just to get your friend to do it. Get yourself a decent bleach kit. Some decent dye and you'll be all set.    Good luck and hope I've helped.|`|pxLV3Tppaa	It depends where ur from

UvYzQv5Saa	What you need is a vision of femininity and a plan for where to go. IE to school or work, the mall, downtown, a night club or all of the above.

Cruel and effective.    To your friend - Forgive me.|`|4JWfH42waa	a maxi dress: http://www.weardrobe.com/pictures/show/8...|`|LjNJiqCZaa	1.  Really painfully high heels.  As high as possible.  It's more about the pain it'll put him through than it is about how silly he'll look - one thing guys can't stand is trying to walk in heels.  Get stilettos, not chunkys.      2.  A longish wig with bangs.  This is another incredibly annoying thing to guys, especially because fake hair just gets everywhere (in your eyes, in your mouth) and you have to keep brushing it away.  Be creative with the color and style other than that - it's up to you!    3.  Stupidly tight, stupidly short skirt.  It makes a man uncomfortable when his balls can feel the breeze.    4.  Fishnets.    5.  Britney-spears-esque long-sleeve belly shirt that ties in the front.  Or a shirt with way too many bows on it.      6.  Makeup, lots of eye makeup especially.  He will probably forget that it's on at some point in the day, touch his face, and smear it anywhere.  Bonus points if he gets it in his mouth or eyes, it's even more annoying.  See if you can get him to wear fake eyelashes and press-on nails, too.      This oughta do it.  The trick is putting him in painful/personally annoying things, not what will embarrass him (if he was willing to agree to the bet, then he's probably not easily embarrassed).|`|NHDUYiPsaa	miley cyrus|`|B5xvIFJzaa	he can wear a rainbow miniskirt, tie his hair in ponytails, and wear knee high socks, that are also rainbow, and he has to wear a tight pink tank top that says "real men wear pink" xD  lol that would be rly funny x]|`|KZGGozvTaa	A huge bra stuffed with something, a very short and tight skirt to show his hairy legs and sky-high stiletto heels so that he can barely walk...

But I think the trick is to keep it healthy :)  Yes there are vitamins you can take,   but those vitamins also make your nails grow CRAZY,  hahahaa, unless you want nails that grow really fast.  Just don't pull on your hair, brush it hard,  straighten it, or put anything hot on it.  && your hair will grow pretty fast.  I don't know if you've heard this, but I do it.  After your shower, slowly turn the hot water off.  Just til it's completely cold!.  Give your hair a good rinse in cold water after showers,  It makes it more shiny and smooth :)    I don't know, but if it's just me and my hair then your  hair would probably grow about 3-4inches in 5 months.  But just take care of your hair, and it grows MADD!      Hope I Helped :)|`|CI07ppIiaa	Trim your ends about 1/4 inch every eight weeks.   Take a vitamin that contains pantothenic acid, like prenatal vitamins.  Avon also sells a vitamin that has it.   That will help your hair to grow faster.

Men who wax there brows are super sexy. Not only does it look good, most women know you went through the pain. I'm not so sure about the really thin feminine style for men, although that's up to you! Go to you local salon and talk to them about styles. You can tell them how thin you would like them. Good luck!|`|AwAw0uiKaa	I love guys with natural eyebrows. It's a very masculine feature.

YjkXyHBuaa	bleach lifts color from your hair  so it doesn't "fade".  & it can be very damaging.  just go to your salon if you don't how to use bleach :]|`|p3GZERIsaa	My advice is DONT DO IT!|`|ZhfYEHVKaa	Bleaching your hair is a chemical process that can be extremely damaging if not done properly. It's best to leave drastic/chemical processing to the professionals. It may cost more, but a good stylist is well worth the money.     And since bleaching is not the same as "dying" your hair (it is actually stripping the color, not dying over anything), it lasts until your hair grows out, although it can grow dull and will probably need to be retouched, depending on how light you go.     Even if you aren't sure you want to dish out the money for a pro dye job yet, many salons are happy to meet with potential clients for a free consultation. Good luck!|`|QP7VyPV6aa	it iwll dry and damage your hair. it will turn it brittle and it will break off. maybe  not the first time that will depend on the condition of your hair. i suggest that you just buy a light shade in the dyes in the dept stores.  it will still be bleaching technically, because you are lightening the hair. but it is not as damaging to the hair because they use a lower developer than with bleach boxes.    besides, that, if its all bleached blonde, how can anyone see your highlights  at least some dyes have highlighy science these days and they still show|`|qELwrqoLaa	I used to bleach my hair so I know a lot about this. It is permanent. It will ruin your natural color because the only way to get back to your natural color is to grow it out. You can try dyeing it its natural color but it won't be the same. Bleached hair is a very weird texture when wet - it doesn't even feel like hair! But it's fine when it's dry. I'm not saying it's not worthwhile if you like the look (I loved it) but it's a drastic change. My hair was pretty short so it didn't take that long to grow out. Your bleached hair will not come back to its natural color on its own. This is the bleach I used:    http://www.sallybeauty.com/Creme-Lighten...    And here are really good tips on how to use it:    http://www.wikihow.com/Bleach-Hair-Blond...    Also, don't do this alone! If you have a reliable friend, mom or sister to help you if you have to do this at home, that would be best. Bleach is very damaging and when you touch up your roots, you need to avoid overlapping (applying bleach where it's already bleached) or that hair will get very damaged. I'd recommend a salon rather than at home but I did at home when I was young and broke so I know the urge. Also, take extra good care of your hair with good-quality shampoo and conditioner if you do this, and be sure to deep-condition frequently too. My natural color was very light brown too which works well for bleaching. But I'd recommend using blonde dye instead of bleach as it's not nearly as drying. I go to a salon nowadays (or a good beauty school like Vidal Sassoon Academy when I'm watching my money) but I used to love dyeing my hair at home. Just be very careful if you choose to do so. You can get really blonde (though not white-blonde) with dye when your hair is light blonde.|`|Mula85EKaa	The answer to the question is you said you kon't want a permanent change bleaching your hair out will damage the hair and will take alot of up keep and to make it look good is hard to do yourself .  i suggerst you just try a lighter shade if you want a change or a new haircut . You get end up with a big mess and thats sad I see alot of girls who come to me to get it corrected and say can I get my old color back again . You can try but its never the same and then you have dry hair Maybe try some different color highlights to spark things up

He is like most of the men that I know.

61abfb3c27511166d19130fdd59840ffaa	Hye there, I had the exact same problem...especially when I frist started to hit puberty...and if that's the same case for you, no worries, it's 100% natural. What I did to help my situation was I drank a lot of cold water while playing sports, this cools you off and keeps you hydrated. Also look for a clinical high strength antiperspirant...and put it on every single morning and a little just before you start sports. If that doesn't help, go see your doctor about this...they will have something stronger than the over-the-counter deoderant.    And as a quick tip, wear dark (perferably black) clothes while exercising...it will hide it much better.    Good luck and hope this helps :)|`|55vTVIxnaa	well..actually sweating is good for the body, but if you are thinking of removing the sweat, the best is to carry along a towel around your neck with you..maybe a wrist band too..if you wear short sleeve shirts, maybe sleeveless shirts will be better..and as for the singlet...I think you should not - as you said it would make you feel hotter! if you want to remove the body odour, then carry along a deodorant =) pretty sure you will be able to enjoy sports and enjoy being the way you are at the same time!    hope it helps! =) have fun!|`|ehfe97Zcaa	Lose some weight?

You're welcome mr. boyfriend.|`|Ha02Iu5Haa	just as long as you dont wear shirts that become "see through" when wet, then have no fear.    everyone sweats and its only natural to sweat alot. just remember to drink alot of water. i mean, no one really care about people sweating.|`|PHYJcSrpaa	use a cream or keep a small towel in your pocket.    nat...|`|jc9VZifgaa	ok use mens antiperspirant.  or to be more specific use old spice extra strength. its like 8 bucks but you put it on at night and in the morning and your good to go i works like madd good|`|b25675544449ff2fcefbf9a700aa80efaa	As others also suggested you can go to your doctor first.  As I don't know the severity of your sweating it may be that even the best deodorant won't help you completely get rid of the excessive sweat.    You can discuss the option of using Botox injections with your doctor. As that can decrease the amount of sweat you produce for up to 6 months (as long as the Botox works).     If you only have excessive sweat in your armpit area you could try armpit pads. Take a look at this site for more information http://www.armpitpads.com/

If it's nothing serious, I know they do make skin bleach and other creams for skin discoloration.

This is a culturally specific question. Meaning that in different places in the world and amongst different races what is considered beautiful differ's a vast amount.    No.2 We are ALL born how we are and this is pre-determined by our genetics which are passed down to us by our parents of course.     No.3 What is average? and what is gorgous? i.e. define average & define gorgous.    No.4 In this country we focus in an almost obsessional way on girls & womens external beauty or physical appearnace. Virtually nothing is mentioned about a persons inner beauty, about what kind of a personality someone has, about their inner qualities. The fashion industry is therefore in my opinion totally shallow & is all about the superficial about what is external.    No.5 A persons physical appearnace is only a TINY part of what makes someone special, different, unique and fascinating & yes! lovely.    No.6 You cannot change much the body shape nature & your genetic inheritance has given you but you can change your inner self & you can with work aim to emphasise your inner qualities. Bringing out your inner qualities means they will be reflected outwardly & people will notice those qualities in you. In other words can can bring out your own inner loveliness and others will be drawn to that far more than just changing your clothes or make-up.    Ivan|`|BA3y6MBlaa	Of course - lets not talk surgery or boob jobs, please.  So not going to help you get pretty.  Pretty is that sparkle in your eye, your lovely smiles and confidence in that you are wonderful.  A good hair cut and alittle makup, and some flattering clothes don't hurt, but it's a inside - I swear.      My advise is when you go out, if you are trying to attract a man, instead of having your focus being a needy girl in search of a man, have it be a girl out to have fun, have laughs, and meet new people.  Believe me you will bring them in in droves.  And be smart to weed out in as friendly a manner that it takes the strange ones that your gut tells you are trouble.  Your gut instincts are Gods gift to you, that is if you believe in him.  Otherwise, it's just a good thing to listen to.  It's NEVER wrong.  Us nicely raised people are taught to me nice to people, but sometimes it backfires and a guy you don't want takes your friendly "no" as a reason to approach you again...he believes there's a chance.  You kind of have to be increasingly sincere and less friendly and hope your not an episode on 48 Hour Mystery.  Why did I go there?  Sorry.    I don't care if your target group are doctors, lawyers, construction workers or whomever, a quick smile, a genuinely open friendly manner drops of the hair flipping, looking at her nails premadonas (sp?) every time.  Invaluable beyond measure is for you to have your own life and goals.  If your goal is to get a man and there aren't others.  You are kind of boring, and what a responsibility for the guy who falls in love with you.  A heavy load if your whole life is him.      I became beautiful when I got my degrees while working full time and I swaned into a confident lovely lady.  I hope you don't have to go through that, but find your path and your passion.  When you get with a man, for me anyway, I was raised by a born and raised Cecilian and Men come first (actually children come first, much to my husband chigrin), but the man is the leader.  It doesn't always work out love.    You ask a question about pretty and you get a novel.  Sorry.  Pretty is you.  I have a feeling you are a swan in waiting.  I blossomed and I had so many dates (nice girl though!) I had a hard time keeping it all straight.   If you have friends that make you feel bad about yourself, it's better to be alone than to be with people not out for your best interests.  Tell them twice sweetly, you don't appreciate it when he/she cuts you down and they continue.  Big time Ciao.

I'd be willing to bet your idea of "average" is probably somewhere between stunning and rampantly beautiful.|`|XA4Sa81Xaa	Of course but its case to case basis. Lets say you are a little overweight, by doing some exercise and proper diet then you can be gorgeous in no time.|`|oMMnfGXIaa	If you have good self-esteem then you will take care of yourself better and then you will be gorgeous on the outside as well as on the inside...|`|CuMYdQV6aa	Be like Britney Spears; she's not much of a singer and without make-up she's rather ordinary to look at but with the right cosmetic treatment and the right agent.......|`|L5IsUhacaa	Enhance certain parts of your body. Such as: getting a newer hair cut will enhance your facial features and bone structure. Get a correct fitting bra may actually help with a fuller figure for your breasts. Do exercises to enhance and strengthen ones bum so it may pop like a brazilians' bum. Get a new out fit that may be more revealing. Guys are simple creatures, enhance what you got, and you may have to swat men away. Good luck.|`|OmDPJvo9aa	It's all in the personality/mind set.

While it is true that the mass media encourages men to be hugely shallow on appearance, your worth as a human being is NOT determined by your appearance.   You decide who you are and where you go.  Other factors such as values, personality, and intelligence will play a much larger role.    BTW, why are you so concerned?|`|J6KraUzUaa	yes, even an ugly person could become gorgeous by a slight make-over.    Umm, let's see, to become gorgeous some steps are needed:  1- try to apply make-up but make sure it is slight to show up your natural looks (for example: thin eyeliner, a bit of foundation and a little blush, with little eye shadow and a blush)  don't over do it.  2- change your hair style into something that fits your face, don't always wear the same everyday try changing it every time and better on your mood.  3- the best thing to do is exercise and try to stay fit and healthy  4- choose clothes that are comfortable and elegant at the same time  5- be happy with your look|`|doxZYj0raa	You cannot become gorgeous in a matter of days, infact there is no souch thing as "absoultly goergous" It's like perfect, there is no such thing.  Everybody is average and pretty, they cannot try and change that.   You are who you are, just don't put yourself down over it.   You see magazines and models who all look plastic, they're totally fake.  You see people who are caked in makeup, who can pull it off just because there like that.    THERE IS NO BEAUTY in this world, apart from nature.  I'm sorry if that seemed harsh, but it's the truth.  The sooner everybody accepts it, the sooner this beauty epidemic thing will end.|`|4fdeb5e83b0e4e59d0ce45d49190dc78aa	It's really not about how you look and more about how you feel about yourself.  If you feel good about yourself, others will see it in you.  Obviously take care of yourself, make sure you have a good haircut that suits you and colour if your hair is mousey etc.  Sometimes just finding that one pair of jeans that make your legs look great or that dress that fits in just the right place is all it takes to make you feel confident.  Know your body shape and what suits you.  Make up can help - accentuate the positive and hide the negative.  For instance if your eyes are your best feature but you have thin lips then make them a feature and use a nude lipgloss on your lips.    If you feel good about what you are wearing and how you look then the rest of the world will see it too.  Smile and be confident.  You can be the most naturally beautiful person in the world and have no friends if you're not a nice person who doesn't believe in themselves.|`|m3L6pLBaaa	i bet your are pretty. You have to think you are pretty to be pretty. if you don't think you are pretty then you probably do not present your self to the world at pretty.|`|1f74df53253928939a96bcca2aa1e1b8aa	We don't all like or go for the same things,everybody is gorgeous to someone out there it's the game of life|`|AA10108021	Regardless of whether she's "average" or "pretty," if a woman learns cabaret style belly dancing then she will be irresistible to men.|`|4BeKVZsPaa	you only look average because you think you look average.  the way to become gorgeous is to work on your confidence.  you are gorgeous, you just have to believe in yourself.|`|NULCdABXaa	you can go get a makeover or learn how to apply makeup so you look better.but you know it,s better to be a good person and nice to those you meet and your friends.honset kind,but do what you feel is right for you|`|EByXhqRQaa	Hair & glamorous (if that's what I mean) make up makes a huge different to how you look.  Trust me, I know.  I look like an effing weird rat without my hair/make up done :s  Just experiment with eyeshadows, eyeliner & mascara, and do your hair in the way you like best.|`|fjHpA5oiaa	I have seen average people become gorgeous. We've all heard that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, yadda yadda, but when you feel gorgeous, your confidence skyrockets. Only a few minutes of self-maintenece a day will do wonders for you. If you don't like your hair, trim it, then find true ways to get it soft and the right texture (internet research baby). If you have some skin issues: wash (gentle), tone (no alcohol), and moisturize (oil-free) after the shower, then puff on some of that mineral make-up, it's great. Blush should be minimal, but don't forget it or you'll be washed out like Morticia Adams. Mascara should be considered one of the wonders of the world, seen from space you're so beautiful. Find a lipgloss you like, rather than lipstick, so that when it wears off there's no noticeable difference or margin of residue. Trim, clean, and buff your nails, and you will feel like a thousand bucks. You know the color of clothes that look best on you, and don't let any professional colorist tell you different. Wear that color every damn day if you have to. Why not? Try not to change the color of your hair. God gave you the color that goes best with your skin, and if you do all the other things above, you won't need to have different colored hair, and you won't have to deal with a yucky texture. If it's already changed, try to match it back to the original and it will grow out. Get some shoes that make your feet look nice and little, don't rest till you find them (more internet, and beware, the right shoes are bound to cost a hundred bucks, it never fails), maybe with a small heel to give your step a click and announce that you're here, drop dead gorgeous. Chew gum. Your breath will be fresh, you won't mind chatting, and it's sassy when you're snapping a bubble. Your cute purse that you carry everywhere will contain a little of the mineral make-up and lip gloss for touch-ups right before you enter the room, maybe a scarf in your best color if it gets stylishly cold, and a pack of the gum you like. Eat vegetables as a third of your lunch and a third of your dinner, at least. Don't question this rule ever. Your extra pounds will shoot right out the other end, you'll be energized, and all of your other problems will probably somehow be solved too. I'm not joking. We already knew you were beautiful on the inside, you just wanted to know how you could bring it out on display, right?|`|3y96DmJdaa	I cant really answer that because we all like different people, so to one person you may look unattractive, but to another you could be the most gorgeous girl alive, It all depends on who you are. That's why i think no one can be categorised at being gorgeous or ugly      Is anyone elses yahoo not showing new questions??|`|AA10335926	Be confident, walk straight, chin up, and always smile...the quickest way to be gorgeous.

RWt78jE5aa	Usually you want to wait two months when working with dark hair, but I have died my hair dark within two weeks and was fine, just don't do it a lot. And if you just died your hair darker, your going to have to wait a month or so do to blonde highlights.|`|LmAetZT7aa	its best to wait at least 6 weeks, trust me. if you dont, you will end up killing your hair! i mean if you want too, go for it.. but its best to wait boo :) good luck girl! |`|IkkBesV7aa	2 months would be best to avoid extreme hair damage.  decide your color carefully so that you will not need to dye it a third time (it wouldn't be the best thing for your hair).|`|XSTVl0kMaa	When you colored (not "dyed") your hair, you might have used a demi-permanent, and not a semi-permanent. OR you could have not been using a color care shampoo. If you are not using a shampoo & conditioner fortified for color treated hair, you risk that color fading faster due to the stronger detergents in regular shampoos.   Depending on the elasticity (i.e. If you pull a strand of hair out & tug lightly on both ends, does it immediately snap? If yes, you don't have much elasticity), porosity (is it dry often? If yes, you have very porous hair & need to keep it moisturized), & over-all health of your hair, I would say absolutely no less than six weeks.   As for the colors: Because it is almost spring/summer, you might regret coloring your hair black in a couple months. I would try the brown with blonde highlights, that way if you get bored with it you can easily cover it with a lower level of color (black). It is much easier (and much healthier) for your hair to go from dark to darker than vice versa. Good luck with whatever you decide to do! Keep that hair fab.|`|F8OrjeWsaa	the darker you dye it, the healther. this is because when you go darker it adds colour (fine for your hair) but when you go lighter you detract colour, which also strips your hair of its natural moisture and leaves it dry and damaged.  if your going darker, you dont have to wait very long.   if your going lighter, wait as long as you can.
38cc8157846426266baa6afc6d5ab186aa	Depends on how you define girly. If you mean feminine, then yes. She sounds like she knows her style and sticks with it. I like her taste! She likes almost all the same music I do(except I can't stand Celine Dion - or Alicia Keys!)  Some people use 'girly' to mean preppy, or popular girl-cheerleader type. She seems a bit more intense than that. Girly girls normally like softer clothes, like minis, cute tops, and pretty shoes. I'd imagine they'd listen to mainstream pop. That sort of thing.|`|teNUDFtGaa	girly girls dont have black nails,wear trench coats and converse.|`|ZcEAnYlUaa	Her music choices are deff girly.. ick.|`|FV0BoSkTaa	She sounds girly, but is trying to be a wannabe emo or something.|`|18c68470068fcbd9d1dcca3fcbc147d7aa	she sounds gay|`|k30TKYClaa	LMAO!!!   i agree with the one who said she sounds gay!! lol that craked me up when i read it.......so funny!!!!|`|wdkdTCkyaa	she sounds girly to me
aV0QmAOtaa	Tanning beds are dangerous and the bad thing is, they don't always work for everyone. If the tanning beds didn't work out for you, I suggest you stay out of them for a while. Try sprays or lotions instead, or something healthier. Why don't you go out tanning naturally? I bet you can get sun kissed at least. Oh and don't forget to wear SPF 30!     i recommend:  http://www.bathandbodyworks.com/product/...|`|5wAk1Ctkaa	jergens color lotion is awsome! and it looks natural|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Yes tanning is coming more out of fashion and pale is coming into fashion. Maybe not now, but in the near future, pale is what everyone (who goes with trends) will want.   Why are you frying yourself in a tanning bed? Even tho you aren't getting any color, you are still damaging your skin.   Not a good move, I advise you to keep your skin young and healthy, tanning beds prevent that.   If you don't want wrinkly and discolored skin when you're older,  then DON'T ever go in a sunbed.   ITS NOT worth it.|`|c2YcBbXyaa	embrace your paleness! there's nothing wrong with being pale.....i love it and i get lots of compliments on my "ivory complexion"|`|1hlIzEnTaa	I'm as pale as they come, very porcelain! Sure there's times when I see the beautiful bronzed girl walk by and want to kick her in the shins with envy, but my colour suits me, and I get compliments all the time about how beautiful my skin is, I think a lot of it is because it's so healthy looking and line free thanks to keeping it away from too much sun! If you're still set on tanning, fake it with the lotions, l'oreal sublime was my favourite,it went on really even and didn't wash/fade off in patches like some do!|`|tJNikP3aaa	I think that lots of women when they get older regret spending hours in the sun or tanning beds to get tan. I know u probably hear it a lot, but the uv rays are sooo harmful to your skin, and being tan doesn't last forever. so when you get older you'll be both pale AND wrinkly, and it'll come fast.  But definately use tanning lotion if you really want to be darker, but i think pale is not bad at all. i would rather be pale and have beautiful skin than tan and wrinkly. just be yourself! it's worth it in the end. ?|`|mzrNTI8naa	use st tropez auto bronzant tan  it is reeeeeally good.    i had the exact same problem until i discovered it  it makes you look so tanned    and if you want it darker (which you probs won't need) just apply more the next day.    good luck babe  xx|`|eLxcDtItaa	Just accept being pale. it doesn't really matter when it comes down to it and those bronzed girls are gonna be a wrinkly mess when they're old.
eUyWJjX1aa	depends what the colors are usually darker reds and blues wont but yellows whites an other light colors fade faster  i would say go for a touch up every 6 to 8 months to keep the luster of your tats  i have a few and im lazy so i go about once a year but they are still nice i have one on my lip and it has lasted so yours should be fine|`|4vqzkIr4aa	Scabbing and and the scabs coming off is normal healing. As for tough-ups, well, that is kinda a difficult subject. When I do a piece I like think that my client will NEVER have to come in for a touch up. There are only a couple of things would cause the need of a touch-up: crappy work, crappy ink, improper after care, skin reject ink pigments, and a couple of others that fall in the crappy work category.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	for one tattoo I had to get it touched up once...all my others still havent had it touched up....didn't need to.      So it all depends.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Depends on the artist and colors used|`|SiDS5jckaa	When you notice that it needs it. youll see it starting to fade a little bit.|`|uv0Y7Ar8aa	You may or may not scab this is normal just try and keep in as clean as possible. Wash with warm soap and water gently at least once if not twice a day helps keep scabbing down. Apply your ointment often to also avoid scabbing. Do not pick any scab or crust that may come over it you will pull color out and possibly scar it. Should not need to be touched up for a long time many years if done correctly.
P1VoMS36aa	there scabs, all part of the heeling process.  if your body didn't heel you would walk around with so many wounds,then you would get infection and risk death.  your 'crusties' are perfectly normal  you can't avoid it, now your scabbing over,don't pick at it or you could get infected.just clean it as you where advised   :)  xxxx|`|oLzOwpfWaa	no it is a scab and it is your bodies way of trying to heal itself just make shure to keep you skin clean and moisturized|`|gqJekAgjaa	crusities?    umm chek this vid...    http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=W5YpXa-1F3...|`|uv0Y7Ar8aa	Those "crusties" are your bodies natural healing process. There is no way to avoid it , you can keep cleaning it regularly and reduce it but while you sleep it will happen. It can happen for years actually no different than an ear piercing.
yf0tevyfaa	NOT in public. In the bedroom it is okay to be sexy and show off the undergarments, but in public I don't think it's acceptable and it makes the girl come off as promiscuous and possibly slutty.    She can wear any type of undergarment that she pleases. It's cool for you to think it's sexy and for her to show it off to you, but do you really want other guys looking at her in public, and other girls giving her nasty face because she looks easy?    I know my boyfriend hates it when my underwear are hanging out or when I have too much cleavage showing. He says it's more exciting knowing that he's the only one who knows what my underwear look like underneath.|`|h9y9xN4Naa	whom do u want to turn on..u or the other guys??|`|AA11683996	Unless she lives in some kind of religious dictatorship it's perfectly fine.|`|cg6BW7Wuaa	i think it's tacky.  white trash a little.  don't show it, it's sexier and do you really want other guys checking out your gf's under things?|`|eJd5CPXFaa	not pantylines.  but bra straps are fine

Please don't wear a flannel or leggings.|`|3hkx6r9Taa	It depends on a couple of things. If he's a bit of a rock and roll guy he may appreciate the leather jacket but if you're trying to keep things modest for the first date you may want to dress a bit more conservative. Also it depends on what you are doing for this date. If you are going horse riding for example you may want to skip the skirt but if a movie and dinner is on the list, try something that shows you're laid back, but still know how to look good even being chill. I think people should dress to fit the mood they want to portray so if you wanna be fun for him, dress fun, if you want to play hard to get, cover up, but let him know what he's missing. No matter what you wear, remember that it's you who will impress him, not your clothes.|`|oLzOwpfWaa	different ones for different occasions but i like this one best     "anoname" skinny jeans  Posted Friday, 1.30.09 at 4:29pm     lovely wearing black skinny jeans  I love my black skinny jeans! I can wear them with just about anything! In this picture I chose to wear my brown boots matching my top. But choose to wear them with flats or heels any cute top and you are good to go! Basically If you are a "diva on a budget" and you like premium denim, but are truly less enthused about premium prices then "Anoname" is the brand for you. It's a unique denim line with attention detail on the back pockets that fills the gap for the young miss to contemporary ladies and is a bargain at $100 or less. I found these jeans at Nordstrom Rack for believe or not marked down for just $20 bucks! I was so excited I tried them on and they fit perfectly!|`|Uz6OKwGxaa	the last...but wear sumthin u feel comtorable n also sumthin that matches ur self...|`|OBRW9JZhaa	If you have really nice legs I would wear something more like this:  http://cgi.ebay.com/Vintage-60s-Mod-Indi...

utKU3xXIaa	There average i think, so did yer parents get pissed at you or something. If so i dont think that the grades marret any kind of punishment if thats the question your asking.|`|1xKS2ak6aa	My parents would kill me. But thats because they have high standards, I dont usually get C's.       But thats just me, in my culture anything below a A- is a FAIL.    Good Job in Art! you got a A, maybe you can use that in the future, but  you need to improve your math because you apply math to subjects such as Science. I think the two most important grades is english and math.|`|dAK8dS4kaa	I think my parents would of thrown a party that I was passing...I never learned what I wanted to in school so I didn't do the homework (Aced all the tests though) in the end I didn't graduate and got my GED.|`|AA12309250	lol good question! um well...first of all congrats on ur A and B+.....C is passing, but then its not the best grade....so I'd suggest tutoring?|`|PlVh12fpaa	nice marks!|`|fmhPSeYmaa	ouch....  pull those grades up if you want to get into a decent university    freshman year doesn't matter    but you should work really hard for the next two years|`|Jd7SnU4Vaa	pretty good marks!  Just next semester aim higher in math aand spanish.  turn those Cs into Bs if you really want to impress us.  You seem like a smart girl.  I'm sure it won't be too hard.|`|exHroh8Maa	hah, my parents were happy if i got all c's,  so no i wouldn't be mad at at all    good job :)|`|czPUF4MRaa	Thats pretty good considering most high school freshman fail at least one class their first year.|`|18c68470068fcbd9d1dcca3fcbc147d7aa	need to imrove in math and spanish.|`|GhBIVVf3aa	If my son or daughter got those kinds of grades I would be very pleased at what they got. If they got an F I would ask them what was going on and why did you get the grade. Then I would help them out to get a better grade in school so they would not get any more F's in school. I would be just as happy as I could for them and I would tell them to be very happy at what you got and that you did your best and you should not be upset at the grades you got in school this year. So you did a very good job at the grades that you have gotten so far you should be very proud of your self. Because I am proud of you at what you did in school so far. Good luck on your other classes that you are taking and try not to be so hard on your self and doubting your self all the time ok. You are doing a really good job in school so keep up the good work.|`|61704ecd7110569d54ceeff103c4b277aa	My parents would take TV away, and everything.
GsxTi1YFaa	If you shave them they will comeback much more than before. The best option is to avoid oily substances. But if you are at the age of puberty then you could wait and after the puberty age it would go. But if not avoid oily foods and if it persist consult your doctor for further info.|`|ieCuJVZtaa	If you shave, the pimples will become visible, simple as that. Although watch out, you just might slice the top of a few of them if you are using a good razor. I suggest popping them, THEN shave, and THEN use whatever clearasil/form of benzoyl peroxide you can find to clear them up in the future.    gl and hope you get a clear face soon|`|V4VGFyxlaa	Maybe you should try waxing. I'm not sure but it sounds better than attempting to shave around the pimples, you could cut yourself if you do that.
L5IsUhacaa	It depends on what work place and what your job entails. If your behind a desk all day organizing and taking phone calls, it doesn't matter that your going semi commando and french legged. But if your job requires you bending over a lot, such as a waitress, or a office gopher I would recomend that having hairy legs is the least of your problems when your twins are freely being stared at by everyone. So, in the end, I would say being bra-less is the least acceptable, since many work places let you where pants or pant suits, or for the love if it stockings with your dress.|`|aV0QmAOtaa	going bra-less. it's more noticeable than hairy legs.  you can cover those with pantyhose or just keep  them behind the desk or something, haha.|`|1xKS2ak6aa	going braless.|`|byHh0A3Eaa	hairylegs omg puke|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	gross to both!!!!!!!!!!!!  Either one is extremely unprofessional.|`|OIQvZ87gaa	All of the above are extremely unacceptable anywhere especially in the workplace. Laziness shows.|`|zX80VRbmaa	Both (hairy legs and braless) are equally bad.      If you have to show your legs, and they are hairy, wear opaque pantyhose pls.  Pantyhose legs are more attractive.     http://pantyhose-legwear-fashion.blogspo...|`|5wAk1Ctkaa	ewww thats hard lol id have to say hairy legs and short skirts....|`|GtSYXc9Eaa	Braless!!

Smashing :)|`|ohsQO654aa	i think its sluttyy|`|86QV5aWQaa	yeah we like those girls with pierced tongues. they kinda look sexy and appealing. but for me, i don't take them in a relationship seriously. they're just for pleasure. because i know that... that is their motive, to attract people. or maybe that's just their fashion. but fashion dictates your personalities and attitudes. :)|`|EByXhqRQaa	I'm not a guy but I have a couple girl friends and that have their tongue pierced, and it looks really good :)  Most guys I know say it's sexy haha.|`|1LTrZbxwaa	It doesn't matter, its the way she can move her tongue that counts.    But it does look sexy on some girls, depends on the girl.

It depends on how they were attached when the suit was made. You can always give it a shot I imagine most will come off without a big problem but you may need to consider buying a new one in case removing the beads doesn't work out.|`|XPZhlkOsaa	No if you do you will have a hole lot of strings and rips in your swimsuit just get a new suit|`|nml1djFKaa	maybe you should just buy a new bikini...if the one you have now is already starting to fall apart!
a1b7e7748fe864b4bfe2e265ef2514c6aa	Hey I take it you havent worked it out yet. Our hair is what we inherit from our parents - take it or leave it   All you can do is keep it in great conditon and wear it in a style to minimise your problems - possibly with some length which may help it to hold down some - as the natural weight of the hair should help it to do this   Enjoy what nature gave you - if you have problems with this then go see a good stylist to help you get the best out of your asset - your hair|`|2wBfPVRAaa	Maybe your hair is too dried out, and it needs moisture.    *Try a hot oil treatment or a deep conditioning hair mask.  *Don't use shampoo that contains "sodium laureth sulfate."  It just dries your hair out!  *Be sure to use a good conditioner.  When my hair is particularly dry, I don't completely rinse all of my conditioner out.  Just leave a little bit in to help seal in moisture.  *I like these 2 product lines a lot (I have dry, curly hair):     http://www.devaconcepts.com/products/cur...     http://www.moptophair.com/    Good luck!
nagNz2q9aa	very warm water, not too hot or it can dry your skin :)  warm/hot water =vs= cold water, for bathing ... cold water wont clean the dirt, oils, and other "undesirables" from your skin very well, if at all.   plus, warm/hot water feels better, and is more relaxing!  and, i doubt that it's very good for your heart to jump into a COLD water bath!! ( i remember watching a film in health class about this, many, many "moons" ago! )    also!!!!    i have never, ever, never, never, never, ever heard anyone, ever say that "goosebumps help with shaving!!!!!!!"  never!!!   i wont shave if i have them!!! that sounds so ... **OUCH!!!!*     enjoy your really warm bath, and, don't forget to wash your belly button!      ~^*/\/\oon*^~|`|ZZJKTV8laa	hot water and yea it kills bacteria but i couldnt even IMAGINE taking a bath in cold water haha i wouldnt be able to relax at all|`|04rQEJQfaa	well in a shower cold water is better for your hair in a bath hot water because ur not normally saposed to wash ur hair in a bath lol|`|qsjGiaW2aa	hot because it kills bacteria|`|bITTzzcVaa	hot water.  the hot water helps kill bacteria.|`|RWt78jE5aa	Warm. Too hot of water will dry out your skin and hair. If your looking to shave i'd say cold tho because you get the best shave when you get goosebumps.|`|GhBIVVf3aa	I use hot water when I take a bath because it helps me to relax and it helps me to get rid of severe pain in my lower back this is in the winter time. Now in the summertime it is something differently I will take a cold bath to cool down when it is really really hot out side and I cannot take it being so hot outside so then I will take a cold bath. basically it is what ever you perter to do and how you want your bath water to be.|`|yqiPSR8paa	well hot def feels better but cold is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better for skin!
ErZZbUXEaa	hey i had the same problem with one of my tubes.. so i just started storing it upside down against my makeup drawer that actually helped the fluid never rushed out after that...|`|dBi78zNraa	DARLING THERES NO WAY. JSUT OPEN IT CARFULLY. SERIOUSLY, ITS CALLED AIR PRESSURE|`|QMnoPj0zaa	maybe you're closing the lid too tight, so when it finally gets released there is alot of pressure, that it makes it squirts out. (if that makes sense)      try not closing it tight?|`|3shqoZ5Oaa	are you shaking it before you open it?  IF SO try not to. it builds up pressure when you do. thus makng it spew out.|`|qzY2tRTeaa	It is called air pressure maybe you can;  1.Not close the lid tooo tight.  2.Not shake it before you open it.  3.Do not sqees it too hard.    Hope this helps.
utKU3xXIaa	dont use alcohol it kill the skin around it as well as disinfecting it, this will promote scaring. In the future use that sea foam stuff and if you wana new stud go get one!|`|1IIY1Ds6aa	google it!! :)|`|ZcEAnYlUaa	WOW who pierced it!? YOU NEVER USE A PIERCING GUN! That makes the wound difficult to heal! And NEVER change a piercing after a week. Whoever did it for you is an idiot! They have horrible advice. I'd call any piercing parlor with a good reputation and ask them for advice. Otherwise just google nose piercing aftercare and you will find some good tips.    Use Epsom or Sea salt to wash it! Just buy a container of some and follow the instructions.|`|NqZFw3izaa	you should have never, ever had it done with a gun.. there's a good chance it may not heal right because when a gun is used the skin around the piercing has to die.. it should have been done with a hollow needle.. then the skin is removed, rather than just shoving something through it..   and it shouldn't be changed after just a week.. i was told to wait a month..   clean it with a non scented antibacterial soap.. salt water (table salt is fine).. and you can even use a tiny bit of bactine.. but not a ton..  and stop using alcohol.. and don't use peroxide or neosporin.. they dry the piercing out.. and try to avoid getting make up or anything like that in it..  i hope this helps.. and please never get anything pierced with a gun again..
VClxXNs3aa	try massaging your scalp every day, use olive oil in your hair to help it stay healthy (before you get in the shower, put olive oil on your dry hair, leave for 5 ormore minutes, then wash out in the shower.) always use conditioner, dont brush while wet, and also, take a pre-natal vitamin every day.... preferably one that has biotin in it.|`|5wAAnZPYaa	FEED urea or ammonium sulphate.|`|RfOHFudyaa	im not sure whi its happening but to help it grow faster and make ith thicker you can try putting crushed birth control pills in your conditioner. i know it sounds weird but it really helps. my hair is past my waist and it keeps it really healthy.

3b5c1b2374e54df48a8dc857796172edaa	I tried it a few times, and it never seemed to take well... My color ended up patchy and it faded pretty quickly... I have heard really good things about Feria, but I wasn't impressed.|`|1hlIzEnTaa	I find that the garnier 100% works the best! covers hair a lot better, doesn't fade nearly as fast and never turns odd colours!(on me anyway)|`|6A0GkXXjaa	I believe I've used it once before, I don't think it's much better than any other hair dyes quite honestly. As for myself, I just use Revlon color silk, it's only 3 dollars, and it works, and lasts just as long as the more expensive ones, and it doesn't stink too bad.    That's just me though, go for Feria if that's what you want, it'll probably do the job.|`|t3PXm1xYaa	I religiously use Starry Night...its like a very black/blue black, it lasts about a month with wetting it daily, shampooing every other day and using color saving products when heat styling (straightener).

oKk49wCWaa	*  Remove old nail polish completely. Using cotton balls leaves traces of cotton on your nails try using cotton bands instead. Soak the cotton band with acetone remover and remove the old polish. If the color is not coming off the press the cotton on to the nail and let it soak for a while.      * It is always best to use high quality clippers to cut your toenails. Cut your nails straight across, leaving about 1/8" of length. Do not let your nail extend over the tip of your toe.      * For a soft square shape, file the nail around the corners in one direction. Use emory boards and not metal files, as metal files rip nails. The smoother surface is for smoothing the nail edge while the coarser surface is for shortening and shaping nails.      * Fill a big flat-bottom bowl with warm water. Add bath salts, aromatherapy oils or Epsom salts and let your feet soak for to minutes. The more calloused your feet are the longer they need to stay soaked. Add about quarter cup of milk to the warm water. Lactic acid in the milk loosens dead skin.      * Apply cuticle remove to the base of each nail and rub in. Wait for a minute and then using an orangewood stick, slowly push the skin back where it meets the nail.      * Use cuticle nippers to trim loose skin. Do not cut your toe flesh.      * Use an exfoliating body or foot scrub and a foot file or a wet pumice stone and remove the dead on the balls and heels of your feet. The idea is the smooth and not the remove. If your foot is turning bright red then stop. This means that you are scrubbing too hard.      * Dry your feet thoroughly including between the toes and apply nourishing foot cream. Rub the feet and rehydrate cuticles by rubbing a little cuticle oil.      * Use an acetone remover to get rid of the extra oils on the nails. Apply a thin base coat and using three strokes, one down the middle and one on each side. Do not paint cuticles. Apply three coats totally and then apply a thin topcoat. Use orangewood stick wrapped in cotton dipped in nail polish remover to remove excess nail polish.      * Let your nails dry completely before you wear shoes.

uv0Y7Ar8aa	Its better to use the same holes as to avoid scaring, however its your prefference. It will be more tender due to scar tissue but since you have already expierenced the pain once nothing to bad.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Piercing through scar tissue is harder, takes more skill and will be more painful. You really should go see a pro.|`|kLPaq30Eaa	It will probably hurt more than the last time because that isn't regular skin anymore, it's scar tissue. And the scars could get worse or the piercings may not heal right because it isn't regular skin anymore.|`|UwD4Gk3Uaa	Well I just re-pierced my snake bites this Sunday and re-did them in the exact same spot because that's where they look best. I'm not gonna say you're stupid for doing it yourself cause I did mine by myself both times. I don't think it hurt me anymore than it did the first time and the first time didn't hurt much cause I have a higher than average tolerance for pain. I'm just gonna say what I'd say to anyone, be careful for infection and anything that can go wrong. If it does get infected don't be stupid, take them out. XD  Well I hope this works out for you and that it doesn't hurt that bad. lol Good luck!!! =D|`|eN5xA6RKaa	my bf is a piercer.   your not supposed to pierce through scar tissue cuz it makes it heal funky  id go to a shop this time around.  and you shouldnt have taken them out, you should have just got spacers for them, tahts what i did when my job said i couldnt have my facial piercings.|`|X8gIe9Tqaa	i had the same thing, i did my own and had it out for a year as i had a child and he kept grabbibg it, last month i pushed it back through, it was a little sore and took a bit of doing but i made sure everything was sterile and now its fine and i have no extra scaring. just ensure all your needles are sterile and make sure you have good after care, as for hurting mnore, it depends on your pain threshold    good luck    xxx|`|l9jIAeo4aa	piercing over scar tissue generally hurts a bit more. but you'll be fine. jus make sure everythings safe and clean and yeah. dont hit a nerve or your lip will drop O.O

eAFA8Crdaa	I have some cute hairstyles for u!    You could make a few small braids in your hair and spritz the end with hairspray to keep it neat and plaited.    You could fold your front parts of your hair (or your fringe if you have a fringe?) back into a quiff and pin it.    Could french braid? If you're not sure how to braid or french braid, then google it! you will find lots of answers...    Plait your hair to one side.    Take sections of your hair and tie them into mini ponytales.    Take the top half of your hair and tie it back into a cute,small bun. Add a little bow or clasp for detail.    Tie it up in a high pony, then braid small sections of your pony and spritz them with hairspray to keep it plaited. That makes a boring ponytail look detailed and prettier!     And don't be afraid to accessories your hair! Buy cute hair bands, bows, butterfly clips from stores like Diva, Toxic, Accessorize and Equip! Cheap and cute!|`|8rM5W0EBaa	Look at this website and see if there is any you like.|`|V4VGFyxlaa	Um maybe it would help if you could describe your current cut.

Its easiest if you choose a celeb that had similar body type and facial looks as you do. For example, I'm petite, curvy, and have pale skin, so I like to look toward Scarlett Johansson for fashion inspiration.    Once you've found a celeb whos style you like, take note of the kinds of clothes you like on them, and then go shopping! The hottest trends that celebs wear can be found (replicas) in stores like Macy's, Nordstroms, Express, Ann Taylor, and sometimes casual stores like Aeropostale, Anchor Blue, Forever 21, and Abercrombie.    Then, find a picture of the hairstyle you like on them and take that pic to a salon and ask for that haircut. Also, take a picture of the makeup you like on them to a makeup consultant at a makeup counter at your local department store and ask that person to help you find those makeup items. You can even schedule a makeup consultation where they can help you learn tips and techniques on how to get that look.|`|GMtfNd3Qaa	stores like forever 21 and a'gaci have cute clothes that are modest. target can also somtimes have cute clothes. good luck and i will pray for your hubby :)
JK8X2wA9aa	It really depends on your hair I use Pantene once and it made my hair hard to straighten and my boyfriend's mom uses Pantene and it leaves her hair silky and smooth.    I reccomend shampooing and conditioning with Neutrogena Triple Moisture. Look at all of these great reviews of the shampoo condtioner and deep recovery hair mask and their website:    http://neutrogena.com    Look at all the great reviews:    http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.a...    http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.a...    http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.a...    Healthy hair tips:    Brush your hair before shampooing and conditioner so your hair won't be tangeled.    Don't wash your hair everyday try 3 times a week    Avoid combing hair while wet, use a wide tooth comb.    Deep condition twice a week    Trim your hair tips every 4-6 weeks.    While shampooing massage your scalp with your fingertips slowly, it's not necessary to shampoo the ends, then rinse with warm water.    When using a conditioner leave on for about 1-3 minutes so you can get great results then comb hair with wide tooth comb then rinse with very cold water to have shiny hair    If you use gel/hairspray/moose stop using them. They damage and dry up your hair.    If you use heat appliaces (blowdryers,curling irons, hair straightener) use a heat protecter spray so it'll protect your hair from heat.    If your in the sun alot buy a cap or a hoodie to protect your hair from the sun, heat damages and drys out your hair.    Buy a leave-in-conditioner/leave-in-... to moisturize your hair all day long and don't rinse.    After your out of the shower set your blowdryer on cool setting and blowdryer your hair for 2 minutes, this will help seal the hair cuticles for a smooth shiny surface.    If you dye your hair do it atleast once a year, hair dye has terrible chemicals that kill your hair.  All of these products work great on dry hair:        For deep conditioning:  http://www.albertovo5.com/vptreatment/pr...    For a hot oil treatment:  http://www.albertovo5.com/vptreatment/pr...

CkvEDmuiaa	Hi! This is a really good one;  http://www.sofeminine.co.uk/beaute/outil...    You have to pay for this one, but it's much better quality, and probably worth the extra few quid.   http://www.thehairstyler.com/?gclid=CJjZ...      Alternatively, you could try using a photo software programme that allows you to alter your pics, there are lots of them around.   I once pasted my photo onto microsoft paint, and then just used the white marker to erase most of my hair to see how it would look short.     Anyway, it's definitely a good idea to test it first, as it's a pretty big decision, and many women just don't suit shorter hair styles. If you have a strong bone structure and a very pretty face, then you can almost certainly get away with it! If not, then do the picture test first!  Also, any decent hair salon should be able to advise you honestly if you would suit the chop.   Good luck!|`|AA10587091	Cut it if you don't like it there are always extensions|`|8Ii1KNvmaa	Is is curly u could always get a Perm???|`|05ec6959f943e866af9a521cda0e0a06aa	Go for it!

Wq2tImSwaa	hmm i don't really understand what yu just said but i am .. assuming you have blonde hair? if you put black hair dye & when it comes off, your hair will be back to normal. whoever gave you the idea of it turning white has their facts wrong|`|BC4oDVCHaa	first, it depends on the color you are and the color you're going.  bleaching dark hair is tricky, and should be taken to a salon.      but if you're light going darker (which I think is the case), then you shouldn't have a problem.  consider going a deep brown (the closest to black you can find) though instead of a black.  you'll look more natural and less trendy, it's easier to change dark brown than it is to change black if you get sick of it, and you'll end up with more natural shine (black hair almost always looks flat).      buy the stuff in the box if it's your first time and get someone more experienced to help you.  don't go to a beauty supply shop and try to mix color and developer.  you run the risk of getting the mix wrong.  "box dyes" are created for amatures, so you'll be less likely to screw it up.    if the color goes wrong, go to a salon IMMEDIATELY.  do not try to fix the problem yourself.  you'll probably make it worse.    it's important to keep your hair healthy after the dye job, so stick with hydrating shampoos and conditioners (you don't have to buy salon stuff, but make sure it's upper end "grocery store brands" and not suave), or think about getting something especially for color- or chemically-treated hair  (Brilliant Brunette is great).  if you go for the latter, make sure it's not "pigment depositing" because that will affect the color that your hair goes after the job.    finally, keep in mind that drastic changes are high maintainance.  not only do you have to keep up with touch-ups, but you will also need to reconsider the colors of clothing that you wear and the makeup that looks good, depending on how drastic the change is.  if your eyebrows are especially light, look into either dying them or darkening them with a brow pencil.    best of luck!|`|eBd22EPyaa	your hair will not become white after they dye wears off, if fact black hair dye is really hair to get out and may take a long time to fade so make sure that is what you really want before you put in on cause you may have to keep it for a while!|`|EmiIiEEBaa	I used to dye my hair black ALL the time,and I never had any of that happen.I started with a semi perminent dye cause I was putting it over light hair and it damages the hair less than perminent dyes.Think about that if you have never dyed your hair before.
QkF5TM8uaa	I use Proactiv for keeping my skin clear.  I only buy the lotion by itself now, though, and only put it on at night before bed... And I use a good biore toner... And just a good face wash and scrub in the shower.  It keeps my skin very clear.  And, for scars you could probably just get a scar lotion or medicine of some kind.  I don't know, it's just what I do and would do.|`|JBcd1Q5Daa	go to you dermatologist|`|4442469461fd44cc40de976f1294211aaa	o see your dosctor|`|807cd6c1b5efc6e8774854c19088e41aaa	just wash your face good with  lots of soap  and drink lots of water|`|Yyz5bdvwaa	idk... how to remove those scars, but proactave is amazing at clearing up acne! it cleared my skin up in like a week, without any scarring.    good luck!|`|97Q7r3Gzaa	There are a lot of skin creams out there that promise to get the job done and they leave us disappointed.

AA11912291	nowdays, fake designer bags are made so that they look extremely real. some ways to tell are if there is a "made in china" tag inside (obvious). the outside of the bag must be extremely well sown if it is real; any fraying thread or peeling is a sure sign of a fake. your best chance of finding and knowing that the bag is real is if you buy it straight from the store. it is too much of a risk to buy one of the internet. i am so glad that you care about buying a real one, because fake bags support gangs, drugs, and prostitution.|`|Hg57E43Daa	expensive|`|nMxGx7dPaa	if you're buying it on ebay or something, there's no way to tell unless they have shown you the interior label. compare it with the label of a chanel you know is genuine. i think even forgers are restricted from the labels on the inside due to copyright enfringement.    if it's cheap, then you already know the answer. no one would sell a real chanel for a drastic reduction.    btw, i am a sociology student conducting an anonymous study on relationships. visit: http://geocities.com/sbiv37/marr

v9OJus2gaa	Per applicarli esistono gli sfumini ...Sono piccoli bastoncini di plastica con un involucro di spugna e servono per applicare l'ombretto; per questo spesso sono inseriti direttamente nella stessa confezione.  Non dimenticre di lavarli periodicamente con sapone neutro...oppure con pennelli particolari e molto profesionali, usati solo da make up artists...Oppure con le dita....     Per l'effetto sar diverso....con lo sfumino (o pennellino) la sfumatura  pi netta ma meno precisa...col dito  pi sfumata ma porta via tanto colore...quindi la via di mezzo  perfetta :   prima col pennellino con movimenti circolari per eliminare gli eccessi e poi col dito per completare ,non calcando troppo cos il colore resta intatto...    Naturalmente, nei nostri beauty case non devono mai mancare i colori base, che sono quelli naturali, neutri : quelli chiari (avorio, bianco perla, rosa pallido per la palpebra fissa e l'arcata sopraccigliare) e quelli scuri (nero, marrone e grigio fumo per la palpebra mobile, il contorno occhi e l'incavo palpebrale) ; poi, si possono aggiungere tutti gli altri : verde, viola ecc...La scelta dei colori va adeguata sopratutto ai colori degli occhi, dei capelli e della pelle : non sempre bisogna rifarsi all'abito...    Con la spugnetta (sfumino) si passa il materiale sugli occhi, mentre con un pennello pi professionale si sfuma il colore...per, di solito cos viene fatto per le star e per chi ha pi tempo...per chi, come noi invece, vive una vita frenetica e pressoch "normale" basta anche solo lo sfumino (o pennellino)...    Alcuni consigli pratici :    -Non usare pi di tre tonalit nella stessa applicazione, e comunque sfuma miscelandoli bene...  -Quando non si  pi giovani bisogna evitare colori iridiscenti o perlati, poich evidenzierebbero palpebre cadenti o che hanno perso comunque elasticit e consistenza....  -Applicando l'ombretto con la spugnetta umida avrai una maggiore tenuta del trucco...  -Se sulle ciglia si deposita un p di ombretto passa il pettinino oppure un altro p di mascara...    Spero di esserti stata utile baci :-)|`|ia8X0lmfaa	alcuni usano i pennellini..ma io adoro usare le mani..mi piace infatti creare le sfumature..mi sembra di dipingere...cmq io applico sempre prima una base di colore piu chiaro e sopra metto poi un po di quello scuro sfumato..|`|nDLNnaV6aa	i make up artist usano vari penelli per sfumare l'ombretto(ad esempio usano molto il penello a lingua d gatto)...infatti l'ombretto va sfumato moltissimo in modo ke il trucco non risulti pesante...si devono usare solo 2 tipi d colori abbinati se possibile...(ad esempio beige e marrone scuro,rosa e bianco ecc)..ma si possono usare anke le dita l'importante  come ho gi detto d sfumare i colori ciaoo...=)|`|eZHFJzjiaa	io lo metto con il pennellino per applicarlo meglio e poi do delle sfumature con le dita.......baci|`|WW0tqq3zaa	con i pennelli ma devono essere abbastanza duri puoi creare diverse sfumature

7e86dc249e02eda2f37c61a8f9972f0aaa	I use Lancome Teint Idole Ultra. It is great for covering up blemishes, and uneven skin tone. It makes your face look so flawless, people compliment me on my skin every time I use it. On top of that I use Loreal translucide loose powder and I apply it with a brush. A lot of people swear by applying their foundation with a foundation brush but I feel that it looks cakey so I use my good old finger tips.    Did you know that you can try ANY foundation at the make-up counters at Macys and if you do not like the foundation you can return it for a full refund, also lots of makeup counters will give you samples. I went through at least 5 different foundations before I found this one. I have uneven skin tone, so much that I get laser and this really works for me. I am also a makeup artist.     I am going to attach a video for you to watch. This is my fav makeup tutorial girl on youtube and she shows you how to get a flawless look with cheaper coverage. The only problem is that often times drugstores don't let you return after you open. I suggest MAcys!!!|`|8a38b1b3e50614a98310be69d150b870aa	I think mineral foundation is always the best solution. Try out Everydayminerals. I know it's good.|`|FV0BoSkTaa	L'oreal Visible Lift  It's amazing!    All of the "old people" make-up is great for evening out skin tones, but I absolutely love this one!|`|1hlIzEnTaa	A really good primer under your foundation is a great idea! It evens your skin tone out,hides your pores/redness, and keeps your foundation on much longer! there are some really good ones, smashbox(although a little pricier), Gosh,Quo, Rimmel has a really cheap one but it's peach toned so if you have really fair skin you have to blend it really well or you'll get the mask effect!|`|eLxcDtItaa	anything from MAC. they have the best make up in my opinion. go to the counter and ask them to pick one for you. they're really good at it.|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	Bare Minerals is the best foundation I have ever used. I don't like allot of their other products, but the foundation and mineral vale is worth the money.|`|jRNexOtWaa	Just try them out! You won't know until you try because different people have different skin, so it works...well...differently for them! lol|`|NqZFw3izaa	i recommend bare minerals.. i've used it for years and it's amazing..  it's good for your skin and doesn't clog your pores..   it's a bit expensive, but in my opinion it's worth it.. it lasts quite a while and looks very natural..|`|d42a27ec46b61c343bffe850b129f3a6aa	I use mineral veil from cover girl.  You could also try physician formula, its a stick of concealer, that looks like lipstick (Except for the color.) It works very well for me!  You can buy both of these products at Target or Walmart (:  Hope this helps!!|`|EVXz49hHaa	I've had the same problem and spent too much money on stuff that doesn't work. But I found something I really like and works amazing its Super Fit by Clinque. Its a liquid (not hard to apply,use sponge or brush) not to expensive but works well. I finish it with the Clinque Perfectly Real Compact, both were around 50 i think. But something inexpensive I've used is TruBlend, works good but its kind of hard to find your right skin tone color.
2Dy6jZBtaa	well im proud of my height. Im a bit over 5'8", my sister is 5'10.5", shes proud too or more over, just doesn't care. Ive been turned down by guys that like shorter women and ive been really looked at by guys shorter than me, same height and slightly taller by a half an inch...my sister usually dates men the same height or a bit shorter or taller. it doesn't matter to both of us...we both use to be self conscious of our height. mostly me because i grew fast in the early years when everyone was just nudging up to 5 foot...and i was already 5'6" to 5'7"...lol...so it was a bit awkward being taller than every single person my age and a grade higher even at age...now that im older i accept it a lot more...even when i go back home to my village where every woman about is about 5'4" and under...only 4 other girls are my height, close to my height or taller. I was called giant, super tall or amazon woman by a lot of people.   things i find i like about being taller are:  you fit clothing a lot better and can pull more styles off because of that    u can gain weight and no one will notice and it takes a lot more weight to even go up a pant size    u can see over everyones head and ur able to find things and people faster    ur legs look hella long and lean in heels    you will always have an advantage when it comes to attention getting because people will see u a lot quicker (i like it when im the center of attention and people are admiring my poise)    you have a better chance at moving up in the chain when it comes to a career, a lot of studies show that employers prefer highering taller folk for athoritative positions    if you have bigger or avg feet, ur feet look more in proportion lol    you will never have a problem reaching something, like the damn clothing on the top of the wall...u know where its about 7 feet off the floor.  lots of other things ike feeling all powerful or very sexy because ur model height.|`|yTAqjJ7aaa	hey, im 5"11 and i have the same as you, some days i think oh i don't care i like being tall loads of people always say how they want to be taller then taller people always say how they want to be shorter lol. However i am sooo self conscious about my height coz guys can be intimidated i guess..losers.. actually at the moment im with a guy whos quite abit shorter than me! What i usually do is think about all the models that are as tall as me and how they've turned it into a positive thing and they are all admired for how they look and having to be really tall for runway etc so thinking about that makes me feel tiny bit less bad.   I think any tip is trying not to purposely hunch up like i used to, although i still tend to just bend one of my legs slighty so i feel more comfortable about my height so i appear abit shorter. But yeah we need to start feeling proudd ! :D|`|dAK8dS4kaa	Maybe he was intimidated that you could look him eye to eye, and he doesn't tower over you. He may of not felt like man then. Personally I like a person who is around my height, they way I can look them in the eye and see that they are equal.|`|bPZlpe0taa	Well supermodels are always tall,you will look slimmer that a lot of women because you have nice long legs and body,you don't need to wreck your feet with high heels and stilletoes because you are tall :D,although you can if you want but you don't need to :P|`|t26ctJdraa	o ur so lucky! i wore heels that added 4 ' and i felt like a queen! really! im 5 even and i think short people are so unattractive!!!  i would love to b taller and feel a lot of people feel the same.|`|VbUpMxrvaa	Become a model.   Or go to a runway & feel short for a day. :)  I'm 5'8 & I used to hate my height but now I don't mind at all.  I would much rather be tall, than short, and have to get everything tailored down to my size haha|`|0iuvUhMpaa	hey there!  im 17 and im 6foot. My partner is slightly shorter ( 5'11'') i know how you feel i use to be really really self consious but it was really my partner who got me through it. Alot of the worlds women are only considered beautiful because they are tall so i guess we should just be proud. at least we can reach things LOL.  good luck hun i hope you accept yourself soon!!|`|ppXoOkJHaa	Your lucky! Models have to be 5"7' and taller. so 5"10' is awesome! Tall is better ;)|`|cLrkXn6gaa	I am not a girl but I am a tall guy. I am 6'5. The tallest Girl I have every dated was 5'5, A FOOT shorter then me. I find taller women very very attractive. I just haven't found alot of taller women. But taller women have alot going for them. First of all in the event they gain weight they bear the weight alot better then somebody who is shorter. They are looked upon as being tall and graceful and given an almost Olympian persona. Although it is true alot of taller men tend to favor shorter women.|`|UAWiu1hUaa	Saaame here.  Im 5'9 and it never use to bother me at all..  but over the last couple of years i to feel ashamed  and just disgusted with my height.  when i SHOULDNT be at all...i should feel good about myself  and with who i am.  Ya there are a lot of short girls and tall girls as well and me being taller..i feel like all guys want is a short skinny woman and thats just not me.  But whoever said tall was ugly or bad.  u just have to realize that no ones opinions matter.  no one can judge you only god can.  be happy with who you are and flaunt it.  walk down the street with confidence and ur height wont matter what so ever if your comfirtable in your skin peoples opions shouldnt matter.|`|18c68470068fcbd9d1dcca3fcbc147d7aa	well u can go for modeling.|`|2L3MXZMTaa	Find tall women you admire in your favorite hobbies or sports. Try to emulate them, their confidence. After a while, you won't be faking it anymore and you will see that being tall is a gift that sets you apart from the rest|`|qdVZceDTaa	hellO! Some tips for you. I hope you will find smthing interesting     13 tips for tall and thin    http://www.millionlooks.com/outfits/13-t...      tips for tall and plus size    http://www.millionlooks.com/outfits/tips...|`|yf0tevyfaa	I'm 5'7 so I'm kind of up there with you and my sister is 5'11. All of my friends except one is at least 5 inches shorter than me and I feel like such an ogre when standing next to them.     In all honesty though, I really don't like short girls. All they have to brag about (most of the time) is being short and saying how cute it is. My boyfriend is 5'10 and I think it is a perfect match, even though sometimes I wish I were shorter I'm glad that I am how I am and that at least I can reach for most things without help. Plus when someone is short, they're abdomens tend to be shorter in length than a taller person, so when they gain weight, it's a lot more noticeable than someone who is a few inches taller with a longer abdomen, basically they look more "smushed" together and 5 pounds to them is like 10 pounds to us.    Just look at it as a uniqueness about you, and 5'10 isn't all that tall. Just imagine if you were over 6'! Plus, most models HAVE to be tall and it is seen as a good trait.    This is just what I keep telling myself, and I'm not really bothered by it. The cool thing about people is that they come in different shapes and sizes  (:

2xyX1w3baa	well, I have been getting mine waxed since I was thirteen, and I'm fifteen. so, I would say thirteen is a good age I mean it is a teenager after all :) hope I helped.|`|YAJrXPXuaa	My mum let me pluck/wax my eyebrows when I turned 14.. Im 15 now..    She always told me that it makes you blink more often than you did before you got them waxed/plucked... Shes weird... But maybe wait till your 14...|`|ZRbTdQ6iaa	I think 13 is a good age to start.|`|18c68470068fcbd9d1dcca3fcbc147d7aa	i started at 18 b/c i didn't even know ppl did that..haha|`|Wep47myuaa	Umm, it bassically depends if you like your eyebrows right now. Do YOU think they need to be plucked or waxed if u do, here is a tip.    Take an eyeliner pencill or somthing skinny and put the end of it at your nose. Point it straight up. Anything on the opposite aide of your eye should be plucked. Now tilt the object u ate using so it touches the corner of your eye  keep the end of it next to your nose and make it so it goes out past your eyebrow. Whatever is on the oppositeside of the pencil should be plucked.     Hope I helped. =D|`|f3yOmI6zaa	I was 12 when i first got mine waxed, it hurt, i hated it. but it was worth it! lol i honestly suggest waxing because its quick and easy. U can buy little sets at any kind of drug store. they explain what to do. JUST BE CAREFUL, DONT MAKE THEM TOO THIN. take only a little off for your first time.|`|8osMkLe1aa	I think anytime between 11 to 14 is a good age to start. Basically you should start when your eyebrows need it and you actually start to care what they look like.|`|r98neii5aa	I started plucking when i was 12.. its all easy and fast but the only thing to watch out is to not muck up shape  :)|`|AA11900717	I started plucking when I was 12|`|GvbAYEGkaa	i startd when i was 10 i wiwsh i didnt thow they wernt even tht bad but it dosnt really mattr how old you should be you can be any age :D:D|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	13 is good age|`|y3lBLqIOaa	14/15
EVXz49hHaa	My eyelashes are the same, and i use the same mascara. Lash blast works really good as well as lash exact, the best thing to make your eyelashes look good with mascara is a eyelash curler from sephora, the travel compact one. I use it with those mascaras and it stays up and curly, full, and thicker with the curler. another thing to avoid is pumping the mascara up and down before you use it, it causes oxygen in the bottle and it makes the mascara flat.|`|t26ctJdraa	use 2 diffrent kinds of mascaras. 1 for lenghting and 1 for thicking. dnt wait ill 1st coat dries add immediatly. curl. and u'll look like eyes wanna pop out|`|Qk9NwiDaaa	I also have this problem and no mascara works wonders.. go get an eyelash perm.. around $40 and last a good 6-8 weeks|`|3shqoZ5Oaa	the best on the market for cheap is the stiletto mascara  plus there is an eyelash curler that heats up with a battery  it works wonders! and they usually are 10 bucks!!    try it out :]|`|84Dauu2xaa	I would suggest a lengthening mascara instead of a volume one.  L'oreal and Lancome do good ones.  They also give some volume and a richer color to your lashes.  Get a good eyelash curler too, it really makes a difference and the curl will hold a lot longer, it doesn't have to be expensive either, most drugstore eyelash curlers work well too : )|`|Jh0yyYizaa	OMG  Get Maybelline XXL curl power mascara!     I've got the same thin, short straight eyelashes but this mascara lifts them up and makes them look longer.   Its a pretty damn good mascara if you ask me...  and the good thing is, the curl holds all day.     If you want thickness, you need to apply a thickening mascara on top.|`|L4FOBRtyaa	i have the same problem as you, but i used to curl them which worked for like 5 minutes without mascara, but i use maxfactor "false lash effect" its really good and make your eyes stand out  hoped i helped ...x|`|Xlod4pSkaa	try curling you lashes first and use the maybelline voluming ( how ever you spell it)
ieCuJVZtaa	First off, either learn how to use some blogging websites well or get a friend to do it for you. Blogs are hard to make but easy to use and post. Make as many friends with other fashion blogs as possible to improve your connections with the fashion-blogging community and 'get your name out there'.    If you dress really well when you ask people to take their picture for your blog, they won't think you are creepy and might even be flattered. Especially if you dress the same way as the people who you want to photograph dress, they'll be easier to work with.|`|uReFjOONaa	whteva
oKk49wCWaa	Some materials stretch/atler permenantly when they are stretched wet. You can soak them in warm water for a couple of hours and then have a friend pull one end while you pull the other. That should stretch them a couple of cm and since they are only a tiny bit short that should be fine.       On the other hand you could just take out the hem and and sew it back at a different length but this depends on how much "give" your hem has|`|7dPwXcItaa	yes becoming shorter will help!|`|Xd6YzVYkaa	You can sew a attachment from an other pair of shortere unneeded pair of jeans andsew carefully only if they are the same colour|`|ype5N1qEaa	You can really only take the hem out...    If you get them wet and let them hang over night the weight of the water will stretch them SLIGHTLY, but they will probably still be wet in the morning so it would be hard to wear them|`|ohsQO654aa	yeah thats what i did... just take out the hem at the bottom of your jeans and iron it over and over and over again tonight... then again tomorrow morning. tonight place something heavy on top of the bottom of your jeans so they cant curl back overnight :)|`|azxM9SEkaa	shrink yourself|`|PFLFEhVRaa	Ok taking the hem out would make the jeans look horrible...    Honestly, I would just try wearing them a little lower on your waist, and wear a tad longer shirt, or stretch the jeans.|`|ppXoOkJHaa	you can take out the hem at the bottom then iron it so it isnt all bent up|`|yf0tevyfaa	I agree with the first answer, but you could try having a friend hold one end while you hold the other, and see if you can't stretch out the leg part a bit.    I don't know any other way to do it.  Good luck.|`|BNjWkxZqaa	depends on ur jeans type of fabric if its strecahble u could stech it and iron so it would be permanent|`|d37aa94bad07542cb4de0984130f5a33aa	What you wanna do is:  1) Tie off the ends of both pant legs in tight knots  2) Fill the pant legs up with rocks  3) soak them with the hose   4) Hang them up in the sun for several days  5) Wear|`|VhxiFt8Caa	I agree, if you can take out the hem do that. Otherwise if you cannot get it to stretch by pulling really hard try adding some lace or something to the bottom|`|JsSeo5YEaa	I used to sew on additional fabric to the bottom. It worked well for me. I'd give it a shot. It's quick; it's easy.|`|eWtqPufZaa	wet them with a spray bottle and the stretch them, then try to hang them sticking the legs in a drawer and the tip of the pants in another drawer so its tight... it should be dry by morning if you just spray them.. like in the middle of the legs. it will give a good inch at least.
tJNikP3aaa	YES it can! if you do not wash your sheets regularly, the dirt and oil can stain the sheets. especially from your hair!  oil has a tendency to stain (even on clothes!) Plus, it could be also worn-out from use. old sheets will almost always get discolored from just plain use|`|aqsUNGfEaa	Yes your bodys oil can change sheets color over time. Totally normal, happens to me too.|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Yes happens to a lot of people,  and its normal but if you want to prevent that from happening any longer then I think you should change your pillowcases over every 4 days or so.   Its also oil from your hair, not just your face.
wsbjZLvBaa	Hey, Try the cetaphill    Proactive did no good besides bleaching my fringe a little bit blonde. I  tried it just to get rid of pimples but i ended up having the worst breakout ever. Also some of my friends that have acne tried proactive but they said it didn't work for them either. Only use proactive if your skin is very oily.  It all depends on what type of skin you have. Every body's skin is different so they can react differently.    I would recommend to go see a dermatologist, They will give you great advice and will recommend products for your skin.    Good Luck :)|`|tJNikP3aaa	from what i know, cetaphil is not meant to treat acne, its meant for sensative skin. i would suggest proactive or better yet a facial cleanser with salicylic acid in it. and then for spot treatments use a 10% benzoil peroxide cream. that's what works for me. the salicylic acid will keep your skin clear without drying out your skin. whereas benzoil peroxide will, and it also bleaches fabric (that's the main ingredient in proactive). so i would just use the benz perox for certain spots, not all over.. ?|`|ph3bkaR7aa	i think it depends on your skin type. I had moderate acne throughout high school and used proactiv and it didn't affect my skin at all. my skin was the same. i used cetaphil because it was more gentle on the skin, and it kind of worked.|`|qGvVJ7rHaa	Well i agree it does depend on your skin. Proactive is great for very oily skin! I need to stress very oily!     Cetaphill is a good gentle face wash that dermatologist recommend. I would go with the one the experts recommend myself.    I used proactive and then it bleached all my clothes and towels etc I really wonder how much good something like that is doing for your skin if it is bleaching you fabric's?    If you are serious and worried about your skin - Pay the money to see a dermatologist Because by the time you try a few different products you would have spent the same amount of money!
DuLhv7Ajaa	Needs a better hair style and those clothes aren't very flattering.|`|oThKwCw4aa	she needs a better bra and maybe a new t-shirt with no patterns on it and doing some exercises has never killed anyone....|`|WodlreGLaa	I think she is a little over weight.|`|LxfjzzM2aa	ewwww! fatass!|`|dAK8dS4kaa	I have no opinion on someone I know nothing about. I will apologize on behalf of the people insulting her by calling her names regarding her weight. If she is worried about her weight, she can lose it. I was one of those people who never thought losing weight would be way to hard. I am 5'7 and was 230 lbs about 1 month ago, now I am about 205-210. With a little determination she can fix that (if she finds it a problem that is)|`|EgbIYBehaa	She looks okay, the photos a bit on the small side though!|`|PlVh12fpaa	is this you>?|`|mbuB22D2aa	She is pretty|`|VbUpMxrvaa	I think she is wearing an inflatable bra.|`|18c68470068fcbd9d1dcca3fcbc147d7aa	chubby|`|P1VoMS36aa	its not for me or anyone else who doesn't know her to say.    what do you think of her?  i think thats what is important.  im sure shes a nice girl,you can't really judge by a pic,as most ppl will comment on her appearance,and nobody should ever be judged by appearance alone.  xxxx|`|eZY40P20aa	If iv to be true...i think she need gym....a lot of gym....ya, but that doesnt mean she cant look pretty the same^^|`|d1d43c8be7b4dd12bd1e7e90583bbe5eaa	could maybe lose a few pounds ... but very talented ... can take a picture of herself while talking on the phone ...

She single?|`|8WYFLp1Baa	picture is too small. can't really see her face enough to judge.|`|yf0tevyfaa	She looks too tense. She needs to relax in front of the camera. Being tense gives of the idea that she is insecure.    She looks young, like she has a little more growing to do, but that could be the posture. Maybe 14 years old?    She probably has a cool personality but it definitely does not show in the picture. Maybe you should take some pictures with her of you guys having fun, and do it candidly  (:|`|BMGEi0yCaa	I don't really like her shirt, but that doesn't mean she's not attractive. Problem is that I can't really see her well. The camera is too far away.|`|ITYgBMJPaa	the picture is too small. she looks a little chubby, but she could have a pretty face.. if i could see it|`|0ii4V9bEaa	she needs a better bra, and to loose weight!!!|`|qGvVJ7rHaa	Do you really need to ask strangers about your friend?

AA6Aq94vaa	For shoes you have to know what size you are.  In the US, Women's shoes sizes are one higher than men's shoes that are the same size. Most stores sell women's shoes up to size 10, though a few places will sell up to size 12. Anything higher you will need a specialty store     Walking, walk with you back straight, with a subtle swing of hips, but not too much, it will look like you are trying too hard.    Talking will be difficult. It takes a lot of practice. You have to speak in a higher register in your voice, you could go to voice training for that, there are also programs that are sold where you can practice certain drills at home   here is a link  to one of those programs:  http://www.heartcorps.com/journeys/voice...   good luck!|`|K4ml1oSJaa	q
OBRW9JZhaa	Fashionable; I think the way this girl wears them with a vintage suit is so unexpected and cute; Idk I just find it refreshing.  http://cgi.ebay.com/Vintage-50s-mod-indi...
tJNikP3aaa	spot some 10% benzoil peroxide acne cream directly on it overnight daily, don't rub it in just leave it on. everytime you wash your face, massage the pimple. i know it'll hurt, but eventally it'll have to come up, and it'll go away faster.|`|fE1KEqCsaa	Don't squeeze it or touch it, it will go away on it's own, it sounds like a spot under the skin.    I had one above my eyebrow that appeared a couple of days ago but it's gone now, I just avoided touching it.    Put an ice cube on it to soothe it and apply a cream if it itches.|`|HEb9nQeFaa	Put a little bit of surgical spirit on the spot with a Q tip. This will dry it out and it will heal quicker. In the mean time use a concealer during the day, but remember to wash it off when you sleep because its not good for the skin. x.x|`|eJd5CPXFaa	its a blind pimple.    its too far under the surface. and so it will go away itself.  the pain should subside after a day or too
mxtWuadraa	I can honestly say I have not. When it's cold I just put on an extra pair of tights and a jumper under my school shirt. =D|`|p3GZERIsaa	No that's unhygienic|`|pRgl7Y0maa	Well sleep in t-shirts and shorts so yes under my school shirt i wear t-shirts and like 3 pairs of thights|`|PSWFAVthaa	No, but if your cold you shoudl wear tights under your uniform, or if this is a fella, wear football socks. Layers Layers Layers|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Yes to the shops - but never to school!|`|CjuL4LYbaa	I sometimes where worn pyjama top under my school uniform in the cold sometimes i were them under normal clothes but not bottems|`|CPXxN3qzaa	pyjama top yess.   but not bottoms.     xxx|`|qfvqOHnyaa	yh i used to love doing that but ive stopped coz i moved to a new school and their uniform is different|`|YvrDm0iwaa	Nope, I wear this thing called A Jumper.|`|hifAPqiuaa	no but i used to wear tights under my trousers lol|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	Nope, never :\.  I'd feel like i've just got out of bed and not got dressed properly if i did :L.  Have you? Have a nice day xx|`|9asvTsiHaa	nope    I remember it was pyjama day at school and i was the only one who turned up in pyjamas, Soo embarassing, everyone else wore own clothes! x|`|PhEl5Lyiaa	No.. Thats just silly. im sure you wouldn't be aloud in school other wise. If your that cold wear thermals..x|`|XoOanmdraa	i spent one winter in sweden after living all my life in texas...you wouldnt believe how cold it was...i used to wear 3 pairs of pants, one of them were my pj's|`|smA22aNHaa	When I was younger, yes.|`|1r05fktRaa	no|`|50UbJp14aa	no i just wear thermal clothing
rE5JEJ92aa	I don't really like either of them....I'm not too crazy about the heels either.    The back of the first dress looks stunning but the front just turns me off.    The second dress is simpler but I think it looks better. It's a classic black dress that would look nice with a fancy elegant hair styles and nice accessories.
oZVWmSpXaa	it looks gorgeous!!
tJNikP3aaa	yes it completely is! your body will react to everything you put in it, and your skin shows your health. drinking a lot of water will flush all the toxins out of your body, which usually clears up skin fast.  But eating oily foods will affect how oily your skin is, which also causes acne. limit fatty foods and stick to water!|`|UMcfklnJaa	acne can be related to diet, but it differs from one person to another. try to cut down on chocolate and oily food, it might work.if it doesn't, then it could be stress related.|`|eJd5CPXFaa	yes|`|cmoGATT9aa	yes. it can be very closely related to diet. fatty, greasy, sugary foods cause a lot of pimples. so do hormones and the like.    ancient cultures had no word for pimples, there is nothing to say that back in the day they even existed! a lot of people belive that this was due to a pure diet.|`|DDQwdurBaa	Yes. Acne is skin oil. So if you eat oily foods, you produce more oil, which leads to more clogging, which leads to more acne. Whenever I ate at a weinerschitzel, I would almost always get acne the day after. Also, I notice that when I eat spicy foods, I tend to get acne more often.|`|wsbjZLvBaa	Yes. Acne is caused by eating foods with saturated fats and can contribute to oily skin. Saturated fats are found in most products  such as meats, dairy. However the body does still require other essential fatty acids - such as fish. Acne and pimples also lead to increased hormone levels. Drinking a lot of water can help flush out those fatty acids, help keep your body hydrated and can contribute to healthy looking skin.    Good Luck :)|`|D9l8adAuaa	nope...a good diet helps with acne....its mostly from oils and not enough mosturizer...even dirty hands...should get proactiv...it really helps...i promise|`|aPGPbbz7aa	yes, depending on what you consume will result in the way your skin and how much acne you have. Drinking alot of water helps flush out all those nasty germies in your skin and eating alot of fibre would help with the skin and acne. eg. eating too many fatty or oily foods would cause your skin to be bad with alot of acne.|`|mTdU6XZMaa	of course!!  the first answer is wrong.  my mom is a teacher of biology in the best university in england(whole of UK actually) being Cambridge university.    i am 15 and i had a lot of acne,due to diets.  my mom was never around really,neither was my dad.  i Lived with a nanny until i was 12 and then i was living on my own with a huge budget for food and i bought all junk,like many other kids my age would.  i lived on it for ages,almost 2 years until my mom realized i had an issue with it (yes,it took her fricking 2 years) but i was unaware that diets can cause acne.  Old wifes tale says ''chocolate irritates acne'' NOT TRUE !  chocolate does not actually,its just what ppl said to kids so they wont eat junk.  However,if u only live on chocolate,crips(chips) and take aways then that is what effects you.  u need the basic ingredients in ur diet-  -5 fruit or veg a day(its not hard. Make smoothies that taste AMAZING,and snack on cut fruit with chocolate cream on top)....have some salad with dinner and ur done..  easy peasy :P...    but if u eat ur five a day or more ...then u can eat as much junk as possible !  bcoz ur body will get rid of the junk,and use up the veg and fruit.  Also water is key,more key then the rest to be honest.  That gives ur body its moisture,natural moisture.  Fish (i only eat grilled salmon and normal tuna bcoz i hate other fish) are GREAT as well...its all for the skin and ur bones.  twice a week is good enough for you. Just have some sandwiches after school with tuna.I never liked fish bcoz i hated the smell until i once tried tuna bcoz i was sooo hungry and that was the only thing  in a shop,tuna and sweetcorn sandwiches.  also when u do this,dont add to much mayo(if any)...bcoz it makes it nasty..really does.    thats all u need to know...but SURE u can drink fizzy drinks and all that stuff but make sure u drink more water(pure/still is better then sparkling).  good luck and trust me,its not hard.    p.s have a look at this video.This is important ON TOP of the diet..  REMEMBER: cleansing is not the only way,diet has to be there! both will make ur face AMAZING !    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=MJGv9UX451...    my face looks great after only 2months of this !!
ovi4hOpiaa	you have to explain to rose and harry what they are doing to nicole because they might not realize they are leaving her out and making her bitter. It would be heartbreaking for 1 of my 2 girls to get cancer but i would do my best to show my love to them equally.|`|73f4817c9af75121ee93853e03437fc1aa	I'm sure Nicole is feeling left out, and due to her age she has no understanding of the seriousness of her new sister's illness.   All she sees is that she was an only child who was the center of her Mom's world, and now she has a sister  who is getting all of the attention.  She's really too young to understand the seriousness of her sister's illness - 4 years is a very self-centered age regardless of the situation.  As her cousin, you can offer to take Nicole to the park or out for ice cream or just to hang out at your house and do something fun while her parents are taking her sister to the doctors or even just to give the girls a break from each other when Jade isn't feeling well.  If both of them want to come over, be sure you don't favor one over the other - try not to draw attention to either one - just do girly stuff and have fun together.  Your aunt & uncle probably need a break too, so offering to take both girls for a few hours (or even overnight if you're up for it) might give them a chance to relax a bit and get some alone time.|`|Oc7Cgi0oaa	shave your head|`|nSDjPfuXaa	Your cousin's hair will grow back to normal slowly after the full course of chemotherapy treatment.|`|yf0tevyfaa	You can try getting her a wig. I know she is only 6 but it would probably help her out a lot. I don't know how much they cost, but maybe you could save up a bit of money or ask a few people to pitch in to buy a few wigs, and maybe even include the younger one in it. Let them both try on wigs and have a little fun. Good luck.|`|KQPDtrw8aa	It is really difficult for a four year old to understand the unfortunate situation. I think it would help Nicole to get along better with Jade if Nicole had one of her parents, or you, take her out and to try to keep things as normal as possible for her. At the same time, it would be nice to take Jade out and give her some special time. This hopefully may relieve some of the tension between the two girls at home. Best wishes.
DuLhv7Ajaa	You need to color your again. You can try products like John Frieda tinted glaze, it will help to keep the color looking fresh. I color my hair a deep red with black low lights and do this every three weeks to keep it nice.
edAtsw3waa	Bio Oil is good, but another thing that works is Vitamin E capsules. I'm talking about the oral ones, but if you pierce one and apply the liquid onto the area it works ten times more then taking it orally. I have used this on stretch marks and scars and they have all faded visibly prob bout 60%.|`|WnMrgSg4aa	I dont think you can ever completely shift stretch marks completely, however, you can try to reduce their appearance!   Avon do a range of products to firm skin and reduce stretch marks. My favourite, is 'Maximum Body Makeover'. It helps to smooth away stretch marks and prevents new ones forming.It also minimises the look of cellulite as well!    Its normally 19.25 for a 200ml bottle but you will often get it on special offer for 9.75.     Try to drink plenty of water & excercise regularly as well,Good luck!|`|QKh5gCkfaa	Bio Oil is the best stuff on the market
AA10236815	i definitely suggest trying clear.now. it's a basic 3 step skin care system but it combines sodium chlorite with salicylic acid to get rid of acne and keep your face clear. it's very gently and non drying or irritating but it's very effective!    http://aorihuela.qbeautyzone.com/|`|edAtsw3waa	I am a Beauty Therapist and my training was very infomative about the skin and products we should be using and I'm here to tell you that proactiv and over the counter products do not work, in fact they are actually cuasing damage to your skin. Proactiv works by drying the skin out, therefore you will have less sebum production and less pimples. However this is extremely harsh to the skin and causes it to age faster.     Products such as Dermalogica, Indio, Thalgo, SkinCeuticals and Ultraceauticals have great ranges for acne prone skin that do not dry the skin out to clear up the skin. They are gentle and antibacterial. They are expensive but the sooner you buy these products the more you will save on money from buying usless products from over the counter.     Hope this helps! I had acne for 3 years before I found Dermalogica and now I only get 1 pimple when it's that time of the month!! Remember though, your skin will get worse before it gets better, but if you stick to it it will work out!|`|FgP7Gz5Daa	Everyone has different skin so you just have to go around and try different products before deciding which one is most suited to your condition.     I'll suggest you a product but I can't gurantee if it'll work well for you. I know it works for myself and a few other people I know.    Try Clinique's 3 Step Anti-Blemish Solution.   It contains the foam cleanser, toner and moisturizer.   It leaves the skin feeler tighter and silkier.   However, I find that my skin can feel quite dry after using the 3 products so I apply another layer of moisturizer from Shisedo. But of course, this may not be the case for your skin.     If you want something a bit more natural, try applying aloe vera to your skin. Aloe Vera is supposed to be a healing product so it can help to lessen acne.   But like I said before, it may or may not work for your skin.    Give it a shot anyways if you think you'd like to!    Hope that helped! =D|`|KQPDtrw8aa	Neutrogena has a good rep and they have a similar 3 step skin care for acne.|`|CjW9fiSHaa	i had a similar problem. i used (and still are using) acne free wash. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND IT. some people say it works, but it didn't for me. i will try a 3 step kit by nuetragena. i heard good reviews. i really can't wait to try it. it does have a money back guarantee. give it a try. i am going to. good luck. hope i helped. i'll tell you if it works in like a week or two.

zviDShi6aa	Get an inexpensive pair of heels to make your mom happy and for photos and take your Vans with in your bag. This will save your feet, because if you don't wear heels often, you're gonna hate your ankles by the end of the night (not to mention the shoes). Or wear some sort of pretty flat that laces up the leg with bright ribbons, that way mom's happy and so are your feet. Otherwise PRACTICE for no more than half an hour a day for the couple weeks leading up the prom. Just wear 'em around your house.     Wear funky tights (or even fishnets) instead of traditional pantyhose. Find a wrap that you really love to wear with it. Or make one out of t-shirts that no longer fit you or are torn. The right jewelry will go a long way in making it personal.    You can buy a simple slip to go under it and attach tulle or other fabric underneath the skirt (or attach it to the actual dress if you're brave). It already has a little bit of tulle sticking out, but you could add to that. Find a scarf you really like and change the belt or wear it over the belt. You can also sew or use fabric glue to add fabric to change the straps. If you're crafty, you can even put on appliques, sequins, rhinestones onto the actual dress to make it have a pattern (sounds tacky, but if done right, looks great).    Good luck and just remember--do what you like and what makes you feel comfortable.|`|9qAYgH0Kaa	Black heels(not to bold) with simple silver bracelet and small thing necklace. i think also a silver sparkly headband would look fab!!|`|cCrDP2tzaa	I think because it is prom, its all about the dress. Also the way you describe your style as relaxed, you should go for simple jewelry. Depending on what kind of jewelry you like wearing. i would say go for some plain silver bangles with maybe a green ring, just small not way over the top. and maybe a simple single strand necklace because your hair is down you wont be able to see your ears, so i wouldn't suggest earrings. Dont go for a long necklace as it would get lost in front of the top green part of the dress, so find one that sits in line with your collar bone.     hope it helps, have fun at your prom.|`|u1nEu56maa	hers a few tips as a belt round the middle add a big ink ibon tied like  abelt    maybe sum badges on ya dress by rock it up    or even try long beaded necklaces|`|4ab58a8654f438c9feb415c928245003aa	accessorized your prom dress with this http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_9O67RJlBn_M/SW...

I know this sounds like such crap to you, but since you are 13, give it time, you will grow into your body.  If you think you need to lose weight you should watch what you eat, pay attention to calories and fat grams in the foods you eat.  Try to drink water or unsweetened tea as an alternative to regular soft drinks or even diet ones, just for variety.  Diet Rite is a great diet drink, no cals, sodium, caffeine.  Exercise as well, walk around your neighborhood or park, try for at least 30 mins a day.

I mean, how is it that you are 13 and don't want to exercise? I would look into other areas of your psyche such as are you depressed?     Other than that, you can figure out your BMR (Basil Metabolic Rate, google it) and go off of those calories. However, if you don't set a foundation now as far as forming muscle, you are going to be hard pressed to remain skinny your entire life. Muscle is the only anabolic agent in the body, meaning that without muscle, you don't burn calories. The less muscle to fat ratio you have, the lower your metabolic rate, and the easier it is to get fat. I'm not telling you to look like Chyna, but a good base is VERY important to remaining lean.    Either work out and eat sensibly (removing sugars from your diet) or become a statistic. It's up to you.|`|AA11102769	You do not need to lose weight. 120 lbs is very slim for a 5'6" person.    If you wish to tone up, exercise.   If you want to live healthier, eat a healthy variety of foods, and cut of fried foods, junk food, and sugary foods.
AA12389809	ya ....its true .......avoid pluking it ..........|`|849ce38541bfaee2a43ed99365c27d13aa	NO! what a lie. it's just a stupid tale. plus if you plucked that means you are smart and  or stressed|`|615e2117cfc3a20e892571e99ccfcaf3aa	no|`|AA11789763	I don't know my mom did that and she has more growing now,but that could be because she is raising 4 kids and a cat.But I don't know,I doubt it your to young and mabey it was a blonde hair that u plucked don't stress out about it!|`|64d249977632aacbab71d5146c3bce0eaa	No, more will not come in its place,but when that one grows back it will be gray from now one because that hair follicle has lost it ability to produce the color of the hair.|`|AA11644538	No, just one.
AA11766539	unfortunetely, many hair-straightening gels out there right now do not work very affectively. However I use VO5 Make it Straight Gel & I can notice that it straightens it a little bit. I mostly use it because it makes it smooths, prevents fly-aways, and prevents frizz. (i have thick, long, wavy/straight hair) It also depends on your hair of course!|`|8600b7bd8055a34a09e7931de7bda917aa	S factor seriously straight! Or Bed head.

bnvbHzzIaa	By using a lip plumper. Your lips will tingle for a little when applied, but it goes away. You can also try using a lip liner (in a colour similar to your natural lip colour). Start by drawing along the outer edge of your lip line, then finish by colouring in the rest of your lip and following with lipstick or gloss. Hope it works out for you!|`|H1ZuIlBTaa	hello erica,i am your secret admirer.try 2 coats of red,the second go deeper into the lip, then pucker,then a thin coat of roll on lip gloss.your welcome!|`|fFpa0rz9aa	QUAGMIRE FTW.|`|0PsnnVb6aa	lick them as less as you can..licking with your tongue causes lips to chap and apply lip gloss/balm in cinnamon or cherry..and dont bite them to avoid bleeding|`|1hlIzEnTaa	There's lip plumping gloss made by soap and glory called "sexy mother pucker"  really good stuff, only about $10 and works better than most higher end $50 ones!|`|RbYEif0Waa	Quagmire you fail to disapoint (Y)  give him the 10 points :P|`|p4sXZTtFaa	they cant  unless you get botox.  lol fugly thin lips xD they ONLY look ok on SOME guys.|`|b1u9jlRhaa	you cant, cause its about your genetic. the only option you have left is a surgery but it mostly dont look natural after that.|`|JyQIY1MSaa	botox it.|`|yRihCgxaaa	Naturally.....???

2wBfPVRAaa	Odd numbered women's sizes are actually "juniors" sizes.  These are meant for younger women (teenagers, early twenties) who don't have a curvy, "womanly" body.      Most department stores (Macy's, Dillards, Saks, etc.) sell actual women's sizes (even numbered sizes).  Otherwise, try Ann Taylor, The Limited, Express, White House/Black Market, etc.
YSmYkc5Yaa	Depends who it's on and if it suits them. I wouldn't call it trashy. Unless the girl is trashy, then she's going to be trashy with or without the piercing.    A monroe doesn't suit everyone and it looks awkward on some girls faces. Other girls, it looks amazing on them.    Maybe try photoshopping a fake one on your face to see what it might look like and then decide if you think it's cute on you.|`|PWkWptVuaa	I like them when the stud is really small.

2wBfPVRAaa	I think that people feel the need to express such dislike because Crocs were so "big," and so many people had them, and you saw them EVERYWHERE.  They were/are hideously ugly, but everyone had them!  I admit that I told myself I'd never be caught in such disgusting looking shoes, but they practicality won me over.  At least I waited until you could buy them in black or brown (instead of super bright, "look at my ugly shoes" colors).  I used to work on my feet all day, and they were so comfy!!!|`|kauRr6X8aa	I think they're ugly lol but they're comfy.|`|AA10450854	Crocs are fine for wearing around the house, or out in the yard, or beach. I don't like it when I see people wearing them at the office (3 people here do that). They are not professional-looking shoes, and these people wind up looking less professional as a result.|`|l5OMFTMUaa	I used to be a croc hater because they are ugly, i must admit but i got my first pair to see what the hype was and those shoes are SOOO freakin comforable and the comfort out weights the uglyness by far! expecially the winter ones with the fur in them - SOOO GREAT! anyway i think people arnt willing to give them a try because they became so popular and they didnt like the look of them... at least thats what everyone i have encountered has told me and they are unwilling to even try them on... but they are missin out man!!|`|6uCZvGoUaa	I have to agree with you 100%. I first saw crocs when I went on vacation to Florida, I guess that down there they are more popular than any other places so I bought a pair and I was surprised on how comfortable they were. Since hen I bought many more pairs on different styles but I also have to point that I also don't like crocs that are too bright, so all my crocs are black or navy blue. I work at a warehouse and here crocs are also knwon for its comfort ( I made their minds lol) And the best of all? when it gets dirty, all you have to do is wash it on a sink or something that it will be good as new.
edAtsw3waa	I am a Beauty Therapist and I have waxed so many people I've lost count lol. A good waxer should be able to wax someone with minimum pain, it's all in the traction (pulling the skin taught) and fast removal, find a waxer like that and you've struck gold. I'm ok at waxing, not as good as others, and most of my client say it's minimal pain about 2/10 but you do get the odd person who says it hurts like hell but they have minimal pain thresholds.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	it hurts little bit , 5/10|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Is that a serious question?   Waxing ANYWHERE hurts like hell.   Except under your arms isn't as painful.     Its not worth it, getting your boyfriends back waxed.   Boys are kinda meant to have hairy bits everywhere haha

542FQ3staa	I guess washing your hair daily strips of its natural oils and can cause hair to be dry, frizzy and damaged. But if you have oily hair and scalp, it maybe irritating not to wash everyday. So basically it would depend on your hair type. If you find you have to wash everyday, there are shampoos and conditioners available which are gentler for your hair and for everyday use.|`|HEb9nQeFaa	Once every 2 days at the most. If you wash your hair everyday, it gets rid of all the oils so the hair follicles will overproduce these oils, making the hair very greasy. I'd say once every 2/3 days is the best. x.x|`|h9y9xN4Naa	1st go and ask shampoos spelling then wash ur hair every alternate day.|`|wbkBpamKaa	i dont think every day would be to good because it gets rid of all the natural oils that the hair needs so once every 2 days would be better|`|cLJT3yZNaa	Do they feel shame after washing with "shamepoo" or do they wash their hair with "shampoo" and feel OK.

1hlIzEnTaa	The salon will have a colour book with hair samples in it so you can pick out the perfect colour, even if you want to go medium brown you still need to decide what tone you're looking for(golden,warm,chocolate, red etc) but when you see the colour samples in the book you'll know! :)|`|6k7C9xETaa	this is confusing bc hairdressers go on a color level scale of a 1 to 12. 1 being black and 12 being white blonde....  a "brown" is going to be between a 2 and a 5...  2 darkest brown, 3 dark brown, 4 brown, and 5 lightest brown....  hope that helps|`|9XzxvLE5aa	Hazelnut or chestnut.|`|ceF5X2m7aa	9 maybe

H3PcFertaa	Here is excellent advice about start to finish aftercare, from a world renowned tattoo artist, Pat Fish, who specializes in Celtic images:  http://www.luckyfish.com/pages/articles/...  here is an article from Karen Hudson with current and accurate advise on aftercare contradictions:  http://tattoo.about.com/cs/tatfaq/a/aftr...  I would add that I prefer Lubriderm unscented start to finish, but Curel is equally good.  No petroleum products, no Neosporin, no lanolin, no saran or plastic wrap, no bandages, no Vaseline, no sun, no picking, no rubbing, no towels or wash clothes, no soaking, no direct streams of water (splash rinse only)  Use antibacterial soap, wash with clean fingers, dry by patting with clean paper towels, apply a light coating of lotion, leave alone.  After it is healed 2 - 4 wks or more, use sunblock for life.  luck! now read the links and watch the video|`|c2YcBbXyaa	TAKE A BATH! just don't rub soap on it....put bacitracin ointment on it after your bath and don't pick or scratch at it.  they should have explained all this to you at the studio...or is it a home made tattoo?? where i live they don't do tattoos on 16 year olds....    you're gonna stink so bad nobody can stand to be around you if you listen to these goofballs...don't soak it in water obviously, but you have to bathe....i should know a little bit about tattoos by now since i have 9 of them and they all healed and look perfectly fine|`|96SqF3Vxaa	DO NOT TAKE A BATH!!! they say that 4 a reason, you cant soak it, its ok to have showers but not 2 hot, only for a couple of weeks or untill the scab has come off, some of mine i have just left alone not used anything on and there all fine i would say do as your tattooist tells you! xxx|`|1K0wnA7laa	its DO NOT take a bath. the tattoo is supposed to basically scab over and peal off kind of like a sunburn so the top layer of skin will be harder, but not really look like a scab. when you soak it, that prevents the healing process and ink can run so its just better to avoid major water contact as best you can for 2 weeks. just the lotion and gently wash with a unscented soap daily. lotion 3-5 times a day with a thin layer.should be good to go in a month, which is when you can get touchups too if need be, :]|`|fwfT8t4Yaa	The person up there with the links in their answer...  YES.  I'd give you a vote, but i've not qualified yet!!  Go with what they are telling you, NO BATH!!!  Shower, antibacterial soap, pat dry, lotion, clean clothes, if its exposed sunscreen.  Sunscreen in your new best friend, wear it every single time you leave the house.|`|CYlk1HJqaa	what a mess........ 16 & tattoo?    funny....!!!  avoid it   don't do that|`|IXxSiXHtaa	Where did you get your tattoo done? Isn't it largely illegal to tattoo a 16 year old?|`|rtx0YQDJaa	i usually recommend a non scented moisturizer which you may have around the house. you want non scented because something with a perfume will burn. as long as what your using isn't a gel or ointment it's fine...if it is i would switch. gels are too thick and don't let the skin breath. put a little bit on around 3 or 4 times a day...just enough to keep the tattoo hydrated. don't cover it in saran wrap because this will cause the tattoo become too wet. baths are not good because tattoos naturally scab over, have you ever had a cut and gone into a bath and the scab becomes wet and loose? well this is what you are avoiding by not taking a bath... if the scabs come off before they are ready it will pull a bit of the ink out with it. this also means no picking or scratching. stay out of the pool as well..the chlorine will fade your tattoo too. if your going out in the sun keep it covered or apply a bit of sunscreen. and always make sure your hands are clean before you touch your tattoo.    hope this helps!

For yr shoe,you can wear high heel with bright colors like dark pink, yellow,purple beside black..Spring is coming soon ,adding bright color shoe will definitely bring out yr whole outfit ....

If you want to go for cool look, wear a nice black hat .Maybe like this one http://img16.imageshack.us/my.php?image=... or any black nice hat you have, and maybe a black  suit...For bag wise ,you can choose a small sling black bag   And finally pair up with a nice cool black boots..

And maybe some little pumps or something :)    xxx|`|FOsd9DP6aa	I think you should lose the socks, or change them to have grey in them or something so it matches your top - which is uber cute :D    & shoe wise, it depends where you're off to but kegs would be cute :) as would pumps.  in white or black; i'd say white, black reminds me of school shoes :|    Anyways,  :)    x|`|EgbIYBehaa	Without the socks it would be pretty average and boring, but the socks add a little quirkiness to the whole outfit!  Maybe choose a lighter denim, stone wash is really in at the moment.
MX3wOs1vaa	It definitely works, but you should definitely do a patch test on yoru skin 24 hours before applying it to the face to make sure you are not allergic or irritated by the product.  It def works but you should not leave it on your face a long time since it can be very irritating.  The only problem I foresee in the future is if you use it a lot, you may suffer perhaps from some hyperpigmentation (dark spots) or hypopigmentation (white spots) in the future.|`|oGBvfDYUaa	No.Definitely no.
PxjbCMl0aa	Green would be for Acne.  The green cancels out the redness.  What you do is blend the green onto the spot and then use either a flesh color over that or your foundation.  If it's cream concealer you don't want to use face powder over it because it gets cakey that way.  For purple-bluish eye bags your best bet is a peachy colored concealer.  Peaches and light orange colors cancel out blues, and then go over that with a flesh color.  I know it sounds weird, because these are crazy colors to be putting on your face, but seriously, it's proven to work.  It's all part of the color wheel.
I2Gsu4tMaa	She seems naturally skinny. I'm naturally skinny too & there's no diet for it. It's just a result of an active lifestyle, eating healthy and being born with a petite figure (small bone structure).    Diets don't work, because you're only changing your eating habits for a short period of time. As soon as you start eating poorly again you'll gain the weight. It's a lifestyle change.     You can't get her FIGURE, though. That's her bone structure and you can't change that. If you're overweight then you should eat healthy. If you're not then you need to let it go and be happy with who you are.|`|iYL37RfPaa	Wow you are really obsessed with her,  sorry for reading all your questions,   but there all like,  how do i get my hair like kristen Stewart  or how do i get my makeup like kristen stewart,  seriously its like your obsessed with her!!    xo|`|cTYAYrb9aa	Jeez.

iMcu2mIEaa	good evening calum f, well the answer to your strange question is simple!! all you need to do is wash the area where the winnit is, then use a curler (you will only need one) then put on some perm solution, keep the roller in for about an hour then rinse the solution off, after this you will need to put on some neautriliser this will keep the perm in longer, keep that on for 30 mins or so then curler out and rinse!! and then you will have a nicely permed winnit :) hope this helps

pEyDW7aWaa	here it is         Start off by dividing your hair, this can be done by parting your hair into two parts straight down the middle. For each side, roll your hair into a bun and hold it up with a clip. You also should repeat the last step for the other part of your hair.      Turn on your straightener, and place it onto a sensible place.      You will then need to take a bit of hair out of your bun this section of your hair you take out should be as thick as one of your fingers.      You then need to hold that section of hair near the end of the straightener. You are then required to place the iron over the section of your hair. Afterwards, wrap that section of hair around the bottom plate.      You will then need to gently close the straightener lightly gripping the section of your hair. Then glide the straightener down towards the ends and rotate it outwards. If you don't like the curl you end up with you can always try again on the same section of your hair      You then need to repeat step 3-5, and use it to curl up the rest of your hair with a straightener.|`|50UbJp14aa	watch this video and see  http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-curl...|`|XzhdKsPlaa	Ha, ha, ha, you don't you use curlers|`|PrqCDZ7raa	You don't. That would be like trying to straighten your hair with curlers.|`|SUzn3qfzaa	Type it into youtube theres heaps of videos|`|2k2ZeUwkaa	Firstly you can curl your hair with a straightener, its called a GHD,i should know i have one, secondly it depends on the type or straightener you have, if its not a really good make, you might have problems trying to curl your hair. Also if your hair is too clean the curls wont hold. try using a spray on your hair-a firm hold-or what ever you prefer, then try straightening it by curling your hair around the straightener-hold it there for a while, as it wont take in just a few seconds.Good Luck!|`|aJFVCGOgaa	On You tube there are loads of help films.      Use hairspray to keep them in place and use slightly lessconditionerr as this soften your hair and makes it slippier  x|`|q1KSTbqnaa	isn't the clue in the question ?? lol|`|v0lHHzAnaa	Edited:  Well,actually you can.

Mwxuzq1Baa	Your like me, therefore we have steps to do.  firstly curl your lashes in three parts (root, middle and tips) this will achieve a natural look not an awkward 90-degree flip.   Now you'll need the primers any should do it doesn't need to be fancy.  use two coats of this (twirl out ward while using the wand) this should already have helped with lenght.    Now for your mascara,   You can try:  Exceptionnel de chanel: this is really volumnizing and is a crazy curler it also lenghtens and the combs help separates therefore no clumps    DiorShow Blackout: This is good, espically when it comes to lenghtening (remember start from roots and twirl out) and i swear my eyelashes look like those in adverts (just less volumn) and with natural lashes.    DiorShow Iconic: I swear on this product, how it curls your lashes its so beautiful, it also lenghtens (I would say this over Blackout). its similar to the blackout except it is made of plastic while blackout is a brush.    L'oreal Volumn Shocking Mascara: Its all in the name: SHOCKING yes, i was shocked, the curling the lenght the everything! However you need to apply more than 5 times to achieve the adverts looks|`|zUFdTyqZaa	I think it has turned out to be the way you apply the mascara as to what type of mascara you use. Though, one suited to your purpose would be better. This is what i recommend you do -   1. Apply your clear mascara (this can be an inexpensive one from boots/superdrug or any other pharmacy); this will act as hair gel but for your eyelashes.  2. As you wait for your clear mascara to dry, you can apply your other eye make up such as eyeliner, eyeshadow etc..  3. Heat your eyelash curlers with a hair dryer, but touch the eyelash curler on your face to see how hot the curlers are. You don't want them being too hot.  4. Curl your lashes from the base and 'crimp' along your eyelashes three times.  5. Apply your mascara (the one you're using now). Start from the base, and wiggle - this will get every lash ( i think this is what it does )  (6.) If you want longer, thicker lashes, then wait for your first coat of mascara to dry; then add another coat. Wait for that to dry, then add another coat.|`|tvF86mRDaa	I use Loreal (one with black wand at one end and white wand mascara at the other). I really like this mascara but always make sure you curl your eye lashes.  Also try www.talkia.com for products that are supposed to make your eyelashes grow quicker and fuller.|`|m5aenb6qaa	Clarins Mascara!|`|aJFVCGOgaa	I like Max Factor it is good! I use that stuff and it works   Use eyelash curlers than your mascara.  x|`|np5R16RSaa	you have to use two mascaras, and different ones. always apply multiple coats too.  loreal volume and the other one with a brush that looks like a comb  use volume 1st, apply from above then underneath ur lashes so that ur lashes are actlly full of mascara all around then when ur done, use the other mascara to comb ur lashes out|`|OoxtLZHVaa	Covergirl Lash Blast. Use two coats & curl your eyelashes before applying it and afterwards.|`|YG7nHfLCaa	u should buy maybelline's unstoppable curly extension. it's real good.|`|QJ8J9vkIaa	Cosmetic mascara is used to make the eyelashes look thicker and darker. It is available in neutral shades such as black, dark brown, and dark gray and it is also available in navy, blue, clear and a host of other fad colors.    Most women prefer black mascara because it is a basic neutral color and it works well on almost everyone for most occasions. You can try a shade of brown if you're blonde.
3e6a7b1f3e03a56ef0cc271441e2531daa	Allow me to unconfuse you.    The vast majority of males would consider wearing feminine clothing as a horrible punishment.  However about 10% of normal, healthy heterosexual men would say that they find pleasure from wearing feminine clothing.  So what's up with these odd guys?    Their brains are hard-wired to release neurotransmitters (dopamine and others) when they feminize themselves.  These neurotransmitters are powerful chemicals.  They produce sensations of well-being, pleasure, sexual gratification and self-identity.  They affect the reward centers of your brain so it mimics the addiction response.  You feel as if you NEED to cross-dress.    You can't stop your brain from releasing neurotransmitters and you can't help but notice pretty feminine things.  So what can you do?    Some men celebrate their cross-dressing.  However, the vast majority of men consider it a problem.  They want to have a normal love life, attract girls, get married, have a good job and a happy family.  So they keep their cross-dressing private.. even secret... very secret.   They limit their cross-dressing to a few times, a few articles of clothing.  They may concentrate on one item of clothing and consider it their fetish.  (Fetishes are very manly.)    That's okay.  These guys are practicing self-discipline.  They are taking control of an addictive behavior.  You really have to take control of your cross-dressing or it will take control of you.  If you don't then you will need more and more feminization to release more and more neurotransmitters.|`|fE1KEqCsaa	You're 14 so your hormones are all over the place, personally I think you will grow out of it.

iZPWWLqVaa	Usually piercings need 6 weeks to safely heal before changing jewellery. I doubt if it would grow over the jewellery, but Id leave it just to be safe. :)|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	You could get a really nasty infection.  Your piercing would take longer to heal  The new stud could be too short and embed in your skin because of swelling.    There is a reason that larger jewelry is used to begin with. You need to leave it in. Usually you can go back to your artist and have it downsized after 2-3 weeks, but this is not something you can do yourself. The transfer needs to be quick, the jewelry needs to be sterile.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	I changed mine after 10 days and nothing happened to it.

The big issue you need to think about is: will I be able to get a job with a tattoo out in the open? Many employers don't take people who have tattoos or tattoos out in the open. That's with.... well I don't want to sound offensive but... that's with BIG jobs like big corporate businesses, teachers/professors, etc. These are jobs that require certain physical requirements (such as a dress code and code of conduct) of their staff. But if you're not planning on getting an uptight job like that, then I say go for it! It'll hurt more than if you get it on your leg or upper arm but there are definitely worse places to get it like your spine.|`|CYlk1HJqaa	for the sake of god dont do that  it will be harmful.........|`|H3PcFertaa	Why maori words? The Maori have tattoos that are very personal and have cultural significance, and they do not take kindly to anyone outside of their culture using anything from theirs. They are deeply offended.  So unless you are a member of a Maori tribe, I would advise you to get something from your own culture and historical background.  As far as the wrist, I have a lot of work done on mine. I barely noticed any pain (more of an irritation) while going through the many sessions to have it tattooed. Except for around the wrist bone, which I advise to avoid completely.. different skin, hard to heal etc. Also, if you get one on your inner wrist have it done above the part where the skin wrinkles near the palm. Much easier to heal because of the movement of the skin with normal everyday use. Also, if you can keep it still during healing and use the other hand, do so.  As far as prejudices about visual tattoos, make up your own mind about your life, knowing that they exist, but that doesn't mean that you must adjust your personal choices, but you should weigh the pros and cons before making a permanent decision.  take your time, there is no hurry, and good luck~|`|fwfT8t4Yaa	Please be careful getting Maori words done, they are very personal.    But, my wrists didn't hurt very much when i got them done, i've had worse! There will be no excessive blood loss, your tattooing skin, not veins of bones!   You'll have to be careful during the healing process, not to knock any of the scabs of, because i have a little white patch in one of mine now, since i knocked it while getting something out of my bag while it was healing!    Tattoos are becoming more socially acceptable, but if you are in a job where they may not like it, wear a sweat band with a pretty watch over the top to hold it in place and they will never know!!    Hope this helps!|`|WsFH6rUiaa	I say get it done everone says no don't its ur skin the wrist doesn't hurt that much the inner thight hurts more. But on the other had the hole job thing comes in to play so get it don in uv ink kick *** stuff but u need to use sunlotion stuff on it. or go with a little white mixed with a light gray scale should work it will be pail but it will be there. Th uv ink is cool stuff got my left forarm done all the way into the palm of my hand beacuse my work doest approve of open tattoos. Take ur time and think about it and yes maori is a big spiritual thing that must be planed out a have a reason in there life. Yours is a dediction to a loved one of a friend.

She has some for all hair types, and it's all natural ingrediants, which I believe, after years of experimenting, works better than anything damn else. And be sure to rinse the conditioner out of your hair w/ cold water so it locks in the conditioner and makes it smoother, shinier and somewhat less frizzy. Also, there is a leave in conditioner you can find by Geovanni or something, also at an organic store, and put that in after towel drying. I haven't found a good product to put in after that, that holds the frizz 100% and doesn't make the hair look too wet. So, for now I just use Aussie's frizz control cream.

AA10797309	I am going to assume the reason is because people 100 years ago had more serious issues to deal with than acne. Most acne is hormone related, it is not always caused by lack of personal hygiene. Marketing today is so fierce, companies want you to believe that you must have some sort of problem, and it can only be cured by purchasing their products.

Years ago the enviornment was cleaner, fast food resturaunts were not as sleazy as today, and people do not take care of theirselves very well. Some people don't wash as much as they should, they are constantly touching their faces and causing oil build up. There shouldn't be more acne nowadays with all the formulas and cleansers, but people don't take time to care for their skin. Also back in the day people washed their faces a lot more because showers weren't common.

However what is higher is the rate at which people are being diagnosed with acne. Just because you have a few pimples or zits, you don't have acne. that called a breakout, not acne. Acne is an internal issue that shows up externally. it's not food, drink, sex(or lack of), it's simply hormones and your bodies reactions to them. I think its sad the way people have flocked to these infomercials like "Proactive" ,becaus they have paid some celeb a  million dollars, Alicia Keys, Jessica Simpson, and Puff Daddy never had acne. They have big bank acounts thanks to people that believe in this stuff. There are some amazaing skin care brands like Murad, PTR, and DDF , etc. that have higher levels of medication for serious skin concerns, not for those who wanna have acne because Jessica Simpson claims she does.|`|AA11551923	I have never had acne.  i was taught that keeping your face  and hair clean is the way to prevent it. acne is caused from pores getting clogged and the oils that clog it hardening causing the pore to swell and fester. keep your hair clean and keep your face washed and it should help..(my grandmother taught me this.. I am 34...she never had acne either)

Spices are added to give a distinctive taste.    Breakfast or tiffin includes idly(steamed rice cakes), dosai (a pancake made from a batter of rice) and lentils crisp fried on a pan, vada(deep fried doughnuts made from a batter of lentils), pongal (a mish mash of rice and lentils boiled together and seasoned with ghee, cashew nuts, pepper and cummin seed), uppuma(cooked semolina seasoned in oil with mustard, pepper, cummin seed and dry lentils.)     There are several variations of the dishes mentioned above which are eaten with coconut chutney, sambar (seasoned lentil broth) and mulaga podi (a powdered mix of several dried lentils eaten with oil).     Lunch or meals consists of cooked rice served with an array of vegetable dishes, sambar, chutneys, rasam (a hot broth made with tamarind juice and pepper) and curd(yogurt). For a non-vegetarian lunch, curries or dishes cooked with mutton, chicken or fish is included. The meals is incomplete without crisp papads or appalam.    Chettinad cuisine is a speciality in Tamil Nadu and will be a delight for those who like hot and spicy non-vegetarian food. This type of food has several variations of fish, mutton, and chicken dishes of which the Chettinad Pepper Chicken is a speciality. The Tamil style of Mughali food can be savoured in the biriyanis and paya. The later is a kind of spiced trotters broth and is eaten with either parathas or appam. Tamil Nadu, especially Chennai, is famous for its filter coffee as most Tamils have a subtle contempt for instant coffee.    The making of filter coffee is almost a ritual, for the coffee beans have to be first roasted and then ground. The powder is put into a filter set and boiling hot water is added to prepare the decoction and allowed to set for about 15 minutes. The decoction is then added to milk with sugar to taste. The final drink is poured from one container to another in rapid succession to make the ideal frothy cup of filter coffee. The last process makes one wonder whether the brew could be bought by the yard.|`|7105120eca961593c0b57e6dcb958955aa	Dosa, Idli and Sambar are the most common foods of Tamil Nadu.

Da piccola avevo dei ricci meravigliosi, poi verso i 5-6 anni sn diventati crespi, poi  sn diventati mossi, e mi piacevano xke potevo aggiustarli in qualsiasi modo. Ora sn ricci, ma nn uniformemente, xk ho delle ciocche crespe e altre invece ricce. e qualsiasi taglio nn si vede, mi sembrano sempre uguali! Cmq x tentare di domarli li asciugo col diffusore e uso la schiuma Nivea x capelli ricci.   Secondo me, i capelli xfetti nn esistono, bisognerebbe avere sempre il parrucchiere a portata di mano!|`|a9286bea881c346abac1a8794da3351aaa	Prova con la linea ricci della sunsilk, favolosa,dopo qualche tempo hai dei capelli cos morbidi che anche il tuo parrucchiere se ne accorger!

AA11625510	Suprise everybody and go naked!|`|aa3c0c46279b2db057545672a002399eaa	Is it dressy or casual?    If it's dressy, then look for a cute cocktail dress or something like that with pretty diamond (or cubic zirconia) earrings. Have nails that go with the dress, but don't match the dress. A kind of vintage plastic necklace would look cute (not ugly plastic though)    If it's casual, look for darker jeans (no major fading) with a close fit, but not too tight. A pretty t-shirt in a plain color (maybe white) will let you add more accessories and customize the look more. Bangle bracelets and a plastic neclace (large circular beads are very in[not the mardi gras beads]). If you want to dress it up a little more, maybe add a preppy cardigan to the look.    For makeup, do something not way to dramatic. A little mascara and light eyeliner with a neutral shad will work. (i'm surprised you even wear makeup in sixth grade). Look for a light gloss that looks kind of "juicy" or "dewy".    Look for all of these looks at Marshall Fields, Saks 5th Ave., Neiman Marcus, or Abercrombie.  If you have a tighter budget, try H&M.|`|AA12005574	go t claires and body central  accessories and jewelery body central cute dresses also maybe some make up at icings or claires

Are you familiar with extensions at all? You can glue tracks in with hair glue, this way it will lay flat on your scalp. (this is done with hair glue)Than you will have to style it. You would probably want someone to cut layers throughout so it won't look all funny.

Mi piace a volte mettere un po' di ombretto per valorizzare le palpebre in occasioni particolari, ma amo i toni tenui e delicati, non mi piace il trucco vistoso.  Sono una maniaca delle sopracciglia, mi piace tenerle sempre curate e con una bella linea, ma senza esagerare nell'assottigliarle, dato che per mia fortuna hanno gi naturalmente una forma che mi soddisfa specialmente nell'arco superiore, mentre le strappo regolarmente nell'arco inferiore sui lati per avere una linea un po' pi armoniosa.  Secondo me le sopracciglia curate sono fondamentali per valorizzare gli occhi e lo sguardo.

ALL you bedding and clothes have to be washed in Hot water. Then if there are any stuffed animals, you have to bag them all up for about two weeks. It's all a mess. Then you have to throw away your vacuum bag. It might take up to 3 washes before they are gone.

Clean your house with bleach products and vacuum all furniture, immediately throw out the vacuum bag.|`|AA12241722	Short of shaving the head and burning down the house, here's what you can do... I did it before and the lice were gone completely :)    Buy couple of onions in any store. Peal it from the brown layers. Cut one into manegable pieces and squize it into a juice and damp the hair with it--the roots of the hairs. Wear a shower cap for about 15 to 25 minutes and then wash the hair with warm (not too hot and not too cold) water, like you would normally BUT do not use shampoo. Using shampoo might irritate the skin and won't get rid of lice (depending on a cituation). Just don't get the onion in her eyes, it'll be uncomfortable and it might sting. Don't worry, the hair won't smell of onion, it will have a scent of freshly washed hair... IF lice won't go away, do it for about a week (7 days). Lice hate the scent of onion, but it's alright to humans.

7b74991cfd96e9cbcf09b21a429650c1aa	Don't listen to people who say you shouldn't dye your hair. Nature needs help sometimes, and people need a change!    First of all, I suggest you talk to a professional, why not ask the friend who did them?    That said, heres my two cents:    If they are going orange (the term is brassy, heh) you probably need to get  a toner applied, which should neutralise the brass! Afterwards you could help prevent thishappening again by using a shampoo and conditioner with toner in it KMS makes a great version, in nz its marketed as California Blonde.     The roots will need re-doing. I know you can get Nice-And-Easy root touch up kits, so maybe try one of those! If not, just buy a packet and use a paint brush (or even better a hair dye brush! about $2 from a chemist) to do the roots!     Anyway good luck!|`|64faa9723ec38afd2e455f4cbe505ba3aa	Ask your friend to give you a "reverse color weave".  She should know what this is, and if she doesn't, never let her touch your hair again.  If you have to do it yourself, it is simply using a pick to separate the sections you want to keep and applying cotton at the roots area and foil around the length of the section.  You should be left with only the root area all over, and your "base" color.  Apply light Ash Brown mixed with 10 level developer, and a little "drabber' to set the new darker shade in, or it will fade out quickly.    You leave this on no more than 10 minutes depending on how porous your hair is.  THIS ABSORBS VERY QUICKLY INTO YOU ONCE IT ALREADY BEEN BLEACHED SO DO NT LEAVE TOO LONG  You may have to repeat this if the color fades out in a month or so.|`|AA10969186	how about not dyeing your hair to begin with.|`|AA11611362	dye it over

GNC has a supplement called "Nourishair" that makes the hair grow faster, you can read what's in it by googling it. Be warned these pills are HUGE and you have to take 2 a day.  Also ProCaps labs sells a "hair skin and nails" formula that does the same thing, supports hair growth and health, and is smaller and easier to swallow.  If you take only Biotin alone, make sure you take at least 2.5 milligrams or 2500 micrograms [the same thing] a day because thats' a good amount to take.

I'm shorter than you and i'm older than you and i've had several boyfriends so don't blame your height. some guys like smaller girls. it makes them feel superior. dont be in such a rush. i'll tell you what i told another girl who asked the same question. dont get a boyfriend just to have a boyfriend. then you're just waisting your time devoted to a guy you don't like when you could be flirting with many guys who you do like. don't rush things and let things fall into place themselves.    good luck.|`|AA11548527	And.... I want a Ferrari, yacht, and a paid trip to Hawaii.  Have some patience, enjoy what you have now, and keep your eyes open for the right opportunity. Life is what you make it.  If you can't be happy without "a boyfriend" or even a yacht, etc., you will most likely not be happy with one. You need to find fulfillment and joy in your own self and life first. Smile, chin up, and stay positive.  ; )|`|AA10649808	I know that now you desperately want a boyfriend, but you are only 13. There is still so much time left to bother yourself with the drama of boys. Focus on things like your friends, hobbies, and family. Concerning your height and weight and whatever else you are self-conscious about, don't let it bother you. I have been incredibly tall my entire life; I always tower over all my friends and, yep, all the boys. Can you guess what I've always been concerned about? You will find a boy when the time is right who likes you even if you are short, I promise!|`|AA12291060	sign in 2 my space Pliny of boyz fine 1'z on there|`|bea64c8eb82535388d31428e874af720aa	I remember when I was 14! That was only 3 years ago but yea. Having a boyfriend isn't that great! Unless you find someone who really cares about you. Guys can be really evil! I've had 28 boyfriends and now I'm engaged, so I know about boyfriends. Don't think too much about it. It'll make you seen desperate and most guys don't like that, and some will see it as a weakness and take advantage of it. So don't worry. I have a friend that's almost 18 and never had a boyfriend! You'll get a boyfriend!|`|AA12007655	First off, having a boyfriend is not all it's cracked up to be...you have to be there everytime he calls, you have to be ready when he wants to go out, you have to understand when he goes out and you don't, you have to understand when his friends hate you or you hate them....YIKES, it's too much work at 40 let alone at 14.  All my boyfriends started out as friends, and after we broke up we are all still friends, we still to this day send cards and letters once in a while.    You really need to just want to be friends and the boy part will follow...Trust me.....  Don't worry about your height, that won't make a difference once you have friends and your weight won't matter much either, you have to be a friend to have a friend.    Try it, at least for 6 months and see if it makes a difference in getting guys attention.  Sometimes guys have this little sence thing that goes off when they feel that a girl is wanting a relationship....and it won't let them get any closer than saying hello.  Turn off the need to have a boyfriend and turn on the need to have friends....you will see a difference!|`|AA12250259	well there are loads of guys who like short girls and they think they are adorable. I dunno..are you really ready for a bf? You donot really need to pressurize yourself because of your friends..but if you really want one then...|`|cba3d483031afb3cd4471fb8c6c1bbfaaa	Hi, why do you want a boyfriend at such a young age? Is it because of peer presure? I did not have any boyfriend until I was 21. Boys at around your age are immature. Older guys (if they really care about you) will not want to go into any relationship with you. Why not take this opportunity to loss some weight, wait and search for a while before going into any relationship. You are still so young, you've got plenty of chances.|`|d45445c2f58abef65093d36c6cdb461faa	boyfriend doesn't mean your not beautiful. just wait and he will surely come to you. just be sure that you love him and he loves you.|`|c31d693e1f604f76562d473cff8862d8aa	i am 30 years old. i don't have any girlfried. now i need a girlfriend.  i am 5ft and 8inc.

Ask his / her opinion about what would look good on you.   When it's been done, try to wait a good 48 hours at least before you judge it. It takes time to get the feel of a new hairdo, most people don't like it as soon as a new cut has been done. Wear it well and ask your stylist for tips to blow dry it like he / she does.

45ca2691c4b93566ba16fcd8266f91d6aa	Man, you all are way off, no offense. Burning calories while your asleep is something the body always does, and if you excercise during the day, your body is still burning the calories. Its all in the metabolism. And, there is no drink to make you lose calories while your sleeping. The only way to lose weight is hit the gym, eat right, get your sleep, and do a bunch of cardio. Thats it, there is no special thing or shorter way. Reducing your calorie intake to around 2000 a day, and you'll notice you will lose fat withing a few weeks.|`|f592ebb18a49ff3325db4b62c2862717aa	ALL THE WORKIN OUT N THE DIETING IS STILL WORKIN IN UR SLEEP|`|AA10192128	Possible means that that is the only time certain people are not eating.

AA10255906	My husband has had acne on and off since before  I met him 18 years ago.  Last year I got him to try Arbonne Clear Advantage.  That was the turning point for him that Arbonne was as great as I said it was.  He thought the best thing about it was the skin supplement.  It heals from the inside out.  Give it three weeks to really work.  Good luck and if you have any other questions feel free to contact me.  I am a consultant but have been using Arbonne products for over 10 years and have lots of experience with different products.|`|498bec4e4b299fae3656851b0328b3baaa	Hi Suzie,  I've been using Arbonne Anti-Aging skin Care since April and fell in love with the results.  I have since joined on to be a consultant.  I personally have not used the Acne line or have customers who have, but I have two things to share that I heard from my upline that me be of interest:  1.  There was a study done with two groups of people.  One group used Proactive and a second group used Arbonne's Acne treatment.  After 6 weeks of use, hands down, results with the Arbonne products surpassed resluts the other group received with Proactive.    2.  A gal in my upline had a customer cancel her order with Proactive.  The operator on the phone from Proactive asked her why she was canceling and she said she's using Arbonne with better results and the operator said, "Um hum...I don't even have to ask you how to spell Arbonne".  She was indicating that she's taken quite a few calls from customers canceling and making the switch to Arbonne.    Because I'm failry new to Arbonne, I don't have a direct testimony about the Acne line, but I've been so impressed with all of their products, I encourage you to give Arbonne a chance.  Email me after you try it and share your results.    Good luck!  --Gina|`|AA11453709	I have never actually used clear advanteges but my best friends, she uses it and swears by it.

AA11308658	It depends on the shade of pink that's your shirt. If it is a light pink then a dark red tie or a white tie would go. If it is a darker shade of pink then I would say go for a more muted tie, like maybe a grey tie, or you might not even want to wear a tie! I think you would still look hot even without the tie..! Are you wearing a suit? If I were you I would gel my hair, then put on some nice slacks, khakki, and the pink shirt with the first, maybe two, buttons unbuttoned. That would look hot...|`|AA11006176	Dark colors, such as brown, black, navy blue..  Bright colors are OK, with the exceptions of red and orange. But bright colors will make you stand out big time!

Your fall out could be contributed to breakage if you are running it under hot water everyday, as you are only supposed to wash your hair every 2-3 days so it retains the natural oils it needs to remain healthy. Washing everyday strips these oils causing hair to become dry weak, and unhealthym causing more breakage, therefore that is what you might be seeing, the breaking falling off as opposed to falling out from the root.|`|d00ad728f442a5ce11c0ff2c4a8c379daa	First I've heard of it.  How hot is hot??|`|AA12369139	havent you seen the bald guys avatar|`|AA11323019	I agree with lasttruediva about the hair, but hot water is also very bad for your hart and circulation.

The hot water is one of the reason to make your hair falling. You know, our hair is form by one kind of oil that makes hair more healthy and shiny.If you use hot water, the oil will be get rid of your hair skin.As a result, your hair is became weaker and then falling down. Also, following the information, the average rate of hair-fall daily is 50 to 80 hairs, so you don't have to worry if your hair-fall not over this rate.  Besides, the regime of having food is also influence to this problem.  I hope these things can help you understand a little bit about hair-fall.|`|d5ccb70899a00e1497b7ca1fd28bd7b9aa	no it is not true, however, if you hit your scalp with tepid water right before you stop shower, it will close down your hair follicles. maybe that will help.|`|AA10655733	perhaps but at leaste you'll always smell good!

781d0adf262b8e0faefaa652b4acc968aa	1 Cleanse carefully: Use volumizing conditioner and shampoo (even if you have curly hair) and   apply conditioner only to ends. "These products are formulated explicitly not to weigh hair down," explains London-based stylist Peter Gray.  Try: Dove Extra Volume Shampoo and Conditioner    2 Give your roots a boost: "Everyone can benefit from a root lifter," says celebrity stylist Harry Josh. Apply the product before blowing dry, from midshaft to root ?- unless your hair is fine, in which case you should aim for the base of your roots only.  Try: Aveda Volumizing Tonic    3 A better blow-dry: For maximum oomph, lift sections of hair toward the sky as you blow-dry, directing hot air toward your scalp. This "cooks" the roots and dries them in an upright and lifted position.    4 Upside-down is not a do: Flipping your head over to blow-dry gives your hair width (think Bride of Frankenstein), not height (think Gisele), notes Josh.    5 Learn to back-brush: Instead of teasing your tresses with a comb (a surefire way to get volume, even if your locks are limper than yesterday's linguine), use a flat-backed brush, which will damage your hair less since the bristles are spaced apart more widely, says Gray. His favorite brand? Mason Pearson.    6 Try a tail: If you have natural volume but can't quite seem to rein it in, New York City-based Aveda stylist Ted Gibson suggests a look he calls "The Puff" (see model at far right). Start with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, then apply a cream-based styler. Next, diffuse your wet locks and gather into a high pony. The result? Sexy but subdued body.  Try: Matrix Biolage Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioning Balm, Redken Contour 08 Shaping Lotion    7 Mist, don't douse: The ultimate volume slayer: heavy hairspray. If you must use a finishing product, Gibson recommends spritzing it into the air and walking through the ensuing cloud. Or, spray it onto your hands and then run them over your tresses.  Try: Suave Professionals Flexible Hold Finishing Spray    8 Exaggerate your ends: If your hair is curly or wavy, you tend to have body at your roots and straggly ends. For balance, Kerry Warn, who has styled volume vixen Nicole Kidman, often blow-dries hair straight first, then adds body back in using a curling iron or rollers from midshaft down.|`|AA11999780	use volumizing shampoos and conditioners and don't put conditioner on your roots. blow dry your hair upside down. when hair is dry, NEVER use a bristle brush because it eliminates all volume.|`|AA11624407	Dry it upside down, and try a hair gel at the root, on wet hair.  You might need layers.|`|090e6acedbcb55487db72319f4c7d092aa	try redken products, such as "guts," its a hair spray that you spray on your roots, and when you dry your hair, start from your part and move the hair on the left over to the right so that you are drying it in the "wrong" direction. that helps to lift the roots up, and if you use product this will help even more.  and just so you know, you have to "train" your hair, so do it everyday and just keep practicing, your hair will eventually catch on!|`|3b9b69c67e49d2af6151178c52cdfbecaa	I had the same problem! here's what you do.. get a trim that is made for adding volume. I got a shoulder lenght hair cut , sort of in the "bob" style.. but more layers.. Then wash your hair with a volumizer, use barely any conditioner (this weighs it down) then dry your hair with a round brush. Then put velcro rollers in it. Hair spray is your best friend.

Also try layers in your hair style, they give the appearance of body and movement.

I have several flat irons.  My hair is short, so I use the smaller Conair one.  I also have a wet/dry that is very good.    I have heard that some of the irons will take the color out of your hair if you use a color....  Try searching for reviews on the one that you like.  You could also try a 'relaxer' that will help get your hair straighter and won't damage it.  I am Caucasian, but have used the Natural-Laxer Plus (NO CHEMICALS) and it works good.  Makes your hair soft and is also a great facial.  It is a herb mixture with sahara sand..  Treasured Locks sells it...|`|f61758da968f860ae50eaa1a64bd4720aa	CHI is probably the best on the market but far from cheap. A friend of mine paid $175 for one at a hairshow and that was wholesale.     You definetely only want a ceramic straightener, they work better and won't damage the hair as bad as a cheap Wal-Mart one.    When I straigten a clientes hair I like the thinner ones (approx. 1") over the large heavier ones, they are much easier to handle and can get it done in 1/2 the time.    Don't forget to use a good straigtening product when using a straightenen. SLEEK by Matrix is awesome!!!!!     Check Ebay for a Straightener, they have them at great deals because I've seen them.    GOOD LUCK!!

Please.|`|a7e5cd6d9bb62f6931f1a47e3609fad1aa	Personally, I like either one (I am hispanic).  Though each one has it's special traits.  A woman with short hair looks adventurous and wild, and depending on how short, the bigger the effect.  A woman with long hair is seems classy yet she will attract attention on any man.  Whichever you feel you tie in with, then go with it.    Regarding make-up, I feel that a little make up never hurts anyone cause it can add color to a skin that seems dull.  Yet, never apply too much make up cause then it will look bad, and if you decide to get too close to anyone (especially with dark color clothing) you will leave your face in their gardments.

Blush is for older people these days.  If you are younger this is what you want.  This is light, and you just tap your blush brush into it  blow a bit on it to get the excess off. Apply to the apples  of your cheeks in a circular motion, add some across the  forehead, nose, and chin for a healthy all over glow.  Look at my picture on my 360 or my site. That is what I do.|`|AA11476482	I use CoverGirl and Maybelline brands IF I ever wear blush on the rare occasion.  And moisturize before putting on your normal blush to keep it from looking dry. Don't put on too much-that may be why it looks cakey OR it may be old. (I can't remember how often you should get new makeup & trhow out the old) If that doesn't work, try Maybelline New York Dream Mousse Blush because it goes on light...not like most blushes.   Good luck|`|969790803581c4854f30d31fe7d594ddaa	the best blusher is the moose one from maybelline its great and because its  a moose it doesnt dry out your skin and its cheap and you dont need to use loas of it.if you put blusher on in powder form try to mix it with a small bit of moisturiser it helps your blusher to stop drying out your skin

Long layers were cut into the ends of Miley's hair and facial layers were added to frame her face. Pulling the top section of hair back created a lot of height through the crown area and is an excellent styling option for smaller face shapes as the height will create an oval appearance.    I think she uses a curling iron, but its hard to tell because she uses so many different hairstyles

aface4e96e0802de7aac35caff6dd997aa	i have to swim for gym now.... what you do is since its early in the day dont wear any for 1st period. once you swim you should have enough time to quickly apply your makeup. if you dont want to go a period without makeup then try getting water-proff makeup. then all youll have to do is do a little touch up on your makeup and youll be fine.    to tell you the truth my skins been fine with swimming and the chlorine. just make sure if your using anything like an astringent that deep cleans the pores and makes them dry to hold off a bit on it because the water will make your skin plenty dry.|`|271825b220e792c4ed4e69811e358f1eaa	I would only wear a little cover-up or foundation to school, then just apply what you normally do after you swim.  Buy a nice brand of facial lotion to use, clinique has a very good formula, at $21 for a bottle that lasts you half a year, and if you buy it when they have a free gift with twenty dollar purchase, you get a lot of expensive nice make-up for the price of the lotion.

I think you can check it out on-line.  It will clear up your skin and keep it fresh and healthy - so you may not need to wear cover up at all any more if it works.  You can look up some natural cures to moisturize your skin after swimming  - I would say once the acne clears up, use baby oil on your face before you swim - most of the water will bead off your face, and just wash it off after.  Good Luck!

RICORDA: le lenti non vanno tenute pi di 8 ore al giorno e se compri le giornaliere, le butti via dopo che le hai messe una volta; mentre le altre (mensili, annuali e bi-settimanali) non devi buttarle via, ma metterle ogni volta che le togli in un contenitore apposta con del liquido x disinfettarle; mentre quelle giorno & notte le puoi tenere su sempre senza toglierle mai (vanno tolte solo quando scadono)    X info, comunque, ti conviene sentire un ottico, che ti spiega lui meglio!|`|49419b2f7186532df964083f73f810bcaa	certo che esistono.

Sono "il massimo dell'igiene" poich venendo usate ogni giorno nuove lenti non c' rischio di proliferazione di carica batterica nella lente n di allergia a sostanze chimiche dei liquidi. Non sono mai una soluzione economica, costano circa 1 euro al giorno. Possono essere considerate una soluzione economica per quelle persone che scelgono di fare uso di lenti a contatto solo occasionalmente (ad esempio per la settimanale partita di calcetto, per l'occasionale nuotata al mare), portando occhiali o lenti a contatto pi economiche negli altri giorni.  Assieme alle lenti rigide PMMA, sono le uniche lenti a porto diurno che possono (se si usa per il risciacquo una soluzione salina non conservata) non venire mai a contatto con alcuna sostanza chimica, infatti venendo gettate ogni giorno non necessitano di pulizia e sterilizzazione. Questo  un vantaggio non solo per la praticit ma anche per l'igiene dell'occhio, cui vengono risparmiati i possibili effetti collaterali dei liquidi di manutenzione.     Lenti a frequente sostituzione - bisettimanali    Le lenti bisettimanali sono ancora probabilmente il "migliore" compromesso tra praticit, qualit ottica, igiene, cio la soluzione pi consigliabile per persone che non abbiano particolari esigenze di correzione ottica, di lacrimazione, di praticit, e che abbiano misure "normali" del bulbo oculare. Non sono le pi economiche per (in generale le lenti mensili costano meno). Alcune possono essere sterilizzabili termicamente e dunque mantenute senza usare alcuna sostanza chimica (sterilizzazione settimanale con calore e sciacquo unicamente con soluzione salina non conservata).  in questa categoria che si trova il maggior numero di proposte delle case produttrici.     Lenti a frequente sostituzione - mensili e oltre  Le lenti mensili e, a salire, trimestrali ecc. trovano verosimilmente la loro ragione d'essere in questo: quanto maggiore la "durata" della lente, tanto maggiore  il costo unitario e il profitto unitario.  Si giustifica quindi una distribuzione con una gamma pi ampia di misure e di correzioni, una fabbricazione pi accurata, una minore percentuale di lenti difettose.  Inoltre si potrebbe pensare che, per quanto detto parlando di gaspermeabilit e contenuto d'acqua, quanto maggiore la durata, tanto minore in genere il contenuto d'acqua, con i pregi e i difetti di questa caratteristica. Infatti quanto pi la lente va tenuta a lungo, tanto pi deve essere possibile eliminare a fondo le proteine e disinfettare a fondo, quindi verosimilmente la lente dovr essere poco "spugnosa".   Tuttavia la resistenza all'"inquinamento da proteine" dipende anche da altri fattori, quali ad esempio la lavorazione della superficie.   Noto che alcune lenti mensili (si veda la tabella) sono fatte dello stesso materiale delle lenti bisettimanali della stessa marca. Devo dedurre che ci che differenzia le mensili rispetto alle bisettimanali sia una lavorazione della superficie tale da rendere pi difficile l'adesione delle proteine.     Lenti morbide di lungo porto    Le lenti a contatto morbide di "lungo porto" (con sostituzione pi che annuale, anche biennale) sono le pi diffuse a parte le lenti a frequente sostituzione, cio quelle che "si buttano" seppure sostituendole a determinati intervalli (da un giorno a sei mesi).  Queste lenti, come le lenti rigide e le lenti rigide gaspermeabili, vengono fatte su misura dell'occhio che le deve ospitare e dunque sotto il punto di vista della qualit ottica e della confortevolezza di porto dovrebbero avere pochi rivali.    Io prendo quelle bisettimanali.. il prezzo si aggira sui 20 euro a scatoletta, che ne contiene 4..|`|b79a1d2e42c0b60c807b5d18ab461805aa	si esistono. ti consiglierei ad andare in un negozio che vende occhiali dato che il costo varia molto in base alla durezza ed alla marca. se sono onesti te li fanno provare per qualche giorno prima di acquistarli. almeno con me hanno fatto in questo modo. poi non li ho presi perch mi davano molto fastidio e l'occhio mi lacrimava in continuazione|`|c3df5c4c1f2e05379bf9665527fccbedaa	ciao io utilizzo da un p di anni lenti a contatto mensili,si mettono la mattina e poi tranquillamente ogni sera prima di andare a letto si tolgono mettendole in un contenitore con dentro una soluzione detergente che agisce durante la notte purificandole.si dovrebbero tenere non molte ore..ma io le tengo parecchio..non mi piacciono gli occhiali..vi sono dei tipi di lenti a contatto che fanno respirare l'occhio piu di altre..forse quelle possono tenersi un p di piu.esistono anche quelle giornaliere..le metti la mattina e poi le getti e l'indomani ne apri un paio nuove..vi sono anche quelli a lungo periodo li usava mia madre tanto tempo fa..adesso a fatto l'operazione al laser..io utilizzo le freschlook colorate qualche volta e mi trovo benissimo sono pure graduate per miopia per perche per astgmatismo no..spero di aver soddisfatto la tua curiosit.ciao p.s io le pago 18.50 una confezione che dura un mese|`|b86de1ff2752b3e2770a59727bbbe8b3aa	si certo che esistono...ma costano un casino....|`|8e889f4a78d8bf54f6a25067cfde3b31aa	MANU:miLIoni

It should get rid of all tarnish in no time at all. This works by electrolytic action.|`|AA10324123	From a quick search, it would seem that Brighton Jewelry is sterling silver?  Sterling tarnishes fairly quickly.    To clean it, I suggest a polishing cloth.  You can find these at jewelry supply stores, hobby stores, and sometimes jewelers carry them.  I have included a link to a wholesale supplier that I use.     http://www.sfjssantafe.com/itemlist.php?  ItemSet=Polishing+Cloths+%26+Gloves&De...    You will see that there are several types.  Any polishing cloth for silver/gold will work beautifully.  * You do not need the rouge cloth, so don't purchase rouge by mistake.    You can also find silver polishing cloths on Ebay.    I strongly advise against using tarn-x, or other harsh cleaners.  They can damage certain findings, and or gem stones that may be part of your Brighton jewelry.      Also, beware of bottled jewelry cleaners.  Some are wonderful.  Others are quite harsh, and may damage your jewelry.  Best bet, if you purchase a liquid jewelry cleaner is to make sure that it specifies gentle cleansing.      'Course, I will reiterate ... silver chain ...  use a silver polishing cloth.   It's super easy to use (just cover your chain, and pull through until you no longer see black on the cloth), and it'll only cost you about  $5. (U.S.), and you'll be able to use it many, many times. Plus, the polishing cloth will return your chain to   like- new condition!     Good luck!    Added:  Good sleuthing Shrikuma.  Of particular interest is:      " .... and then lavishly dipped in pure silver. Since silver has a natural tendency to tarnish (oxidize) and scratch, we add a protective layer of lacquer to assist in retarding this typical occurrence."    Gina, this is important because Shirokuma is right about   pure/ fine (.999) silver oxidizing at such a slow pace as to be virturally tarnish proof.  If your chain is a base metal, with electroplating or dipped .999 pure silver layering, and it is badly tarnished, then the silver has worn off, and no amount of cleaning will ever return your chain to it's previous condition.    Look for a  " .925 " mark on the chain - probably on the clasp.  If it doesn't say .925 then I wouldn't get my hopes up about returning it to it's former glory.      Purchasing a polishing cloth and giving your necklace an attempt at cleaning couldn't hurt.  If it's layered, and beyond restoration, then you'll still have the polishing cloth for your other jewelry.  And, if it is .925, then it'll clean up beautifully.|`|1ae2253110a6fd63ad511fc31ecda547aa	I'm following up on Gemlover's answer. The Brighton Jewelry product line gives no indication that it is made of silver, only silver in color.    I found this on their website:    ""Brighton rings are sterling silver. Other jewelry items and silver ornaments are cast in solid brass or zinc, and then lavishly dipped in pure silver. Since silver has a natural tendency to tarnish (oxidize) and scratch, we add a protective layer of lacquer to assist in retarding this typical occurrence.""     Look for a micro stamp or tag that reads "925". this would indicate sterling silver, a mix of 92.5% silver and 7.5% alloys (usually copper). If you have any real silver and not just a flash coating of silver, then you have a chance of removing the tarnish without the risk of destroying the jewelry.    I use a Sunshine cloth from RioGrande (www.riogrande.com) for cleaning up jewelry. It's fast, reuseable, and doesn't leave scratches like other cloths I have tried. Your local independent jeweler probably has them on the counter.    If your Brighton jewelry is base metal, i.e. the cast zinc dipped in pure silver schlock described above, then the best advice I have is throw it in the trash.    Pure silver doesn't tarnish! I can put a torch flame to pure silver and it will clean it. The lacquer coating will not prevent oxidation for any long period of time, but it will keep any scratches from cutting through the pure silver and into the cast metal, where the real oxidation would begin.

fa899b45266ea0483456440b97ba94a0aa	What we do in this situation is we wet the hair, squeeze the excess moisture out, and comb perm solution into the hair. We don't put it in rollers; instead, we let the perm solution develop on the hair while it is hanging straight (and because it is moist, it will hang straight). This loosens the curl, effectively "perming" it into a straighter shape. Then after it's developed, we neutralize and rinse out according to regular procedure.    Before doing this, deep-condition the hair every day for about 1-2 weeks to give it time to recover and gain strength. (Back-to-back perms can take a toll on hair.) The daily deep conditioning may even loosen the curl a bit.    Do NOT use a relaxer. Relaxers are MUCH more damaging to hair than perms. To use relaxer on already-permed hair is to commit hair suicide.    For a quick fix in the meantime, it's easiest to weigh down the hair with styling pomade. There are a ton of these in your local drugstore. Most of them are labelled as "hair-straightening balm", but any thick pomade-like product has the same effect.    If he were to decide to keep the perm, he does not have to set his hair in rollers every time he washes it. That's ridiculous. He can just blow-dry it straight (on a cool setting to avoid heat damage).    Either your friend is not communicating with his stylist very well, or the stylist is not very competent. If the latter is the case, I suggest finding someone else to do his hair from now on.    Good luck!|`|53b7ce303976bb1cc771fd8841b94c49aa	He will just have to wait a few weeks until it relaxes on his own. Perms are super tight when they are first put in.  Give it time.   On another note. Tell your friend to stop being so controlling of her boyfriend... I mean... a perm on a guy?  She should like or love him for who he is. Not treat him like a doll to dress up or make him look how she wants him to.|`|6a77a4d8703864a177f2bade85ef7d51aa	Give it time it will relax, but tell him to go ahead and shampoo it right away.  You are supposed to wait a couple of days but go ahead it might help relax it.  Don't use any chemicals for a week or two it might compromise the integrety of the hair and fall out or make it frizz out.  So just be patient and give him a hait tie to pull it back for a while.|`|AA11145682	i don't think i'm not sure

AA10989494	I'd suggest a combination of red and blonde highlights.  Now, not the bleached out white blonde, but lighter strands in a nice golden color that accompanied by the red (not brassy) highlights will give your style a great boost.  Also, go to a colorist, they can give you some great advice, schedule a consultation (could cost some $$, check when you make the appointment) if you like what she has to say then go back to her and have the highlights done.  I prefer the foil method, to the cap.  The cap seems to come out more like streaks rather than a natural looking highlight/lowlights.  Better yet, if you see someone with color that you want stop them and ask, women love compliments and would be happy to pass along their favorite colorist/stylist name.|`|AA12039619	you should get like some really black, black ones because it will look really nice with ur red..maroon hair color...also if you want to go crazy..ger some hot pink ones, that will look nice too.!!!!!!|`|AA12225567	You should defently get it in brown|`|95121888c1a027f79d808b4b3a3ed7dbaa	I would go with the black highlights or it may look to brassy, I'm blonde and just went with 2 different (lighter) shades and it loooks fab-o-lus!!Good Luck and ck out the photos below for your hair.|`|AA11020911	1.

Just use your imagination and I bet u can come up with  beautiful solutions.       For example, u can sew a colorful pocket with sleeves to match  on a very inexpensive  t-shirt to dress it up.

AA12393872	Ooh- not too short- you'll look too butch-lol :) -   Dear, it really depends on the shape of your face. Girls who have wider/chubbier faces should wear their hair on the short side which looks more balanced and not too overwhelming. While girls with thinner faces should keep the hair longer, fuller or even curly to fill out the appearance. Balance and symmetry is the whole goal here.  I hope that helps.|`|1aee9196e19b183947c5fd70d396dd1daa	mabey keep it the same but just get some layers in the back.|`|bd1fc438bbaa8faa1b4feb9f664a1608aa	http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/hairguid...

82f01eb1519c0efa6241fa3b95ff45bcaa	Think about all the people out there who aren't fortunate enough to have the best type of clothes. There are people you see everyday in your school with this problem too. But no one gives a care. They aren't good enough to meet your "standards". (I dont mean you, i'm takling about everyone other than them). And look at the people who, all they care about is fashion, fashion. The real person is inside. BUT, don't get me wrong, it sucks to look like crap. So, dress up, but don't get carried away becuase it's just not right. it doesn't matter if you shop at WalMart, or American Eagle, abercrombie, etc.   Sorry if I offended you but I just jad to say that.  I'm not saying you're a bad person.|`|af76a14c1263f139bac1dc0f24f03d47aa	The media everywhere!
