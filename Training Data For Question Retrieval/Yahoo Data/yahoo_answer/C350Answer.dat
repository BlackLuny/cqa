fMfmzuotaa	Yes I like it, but it seems slightly out of date. It doesn't seem new or fresh or anything. It sounds like an album they should have released 5 years ago. With that being said, some of the tracks on it are very good, especially Lucid Dreams. I prefer Franz Ferdinands other 2 albums, but this one might grow on me more over time.|`|IW3jmnKbaa	Them guy's took weird, and made it weirder, but "take me out" is their only "good" tune.

oRQQRGlVaa	I don't know if that was really a horoscope reading that she found or something she made up, but it isn't something I would give a boyfriend to read since it isn't very nice.  Normally a girl would give a nice reading because she wants to feel closer to you, this just doesn't sound right.  I would ask her why she sent it, it sounds like she is making a hint to you.  Sagittariuses are free spirits and you cant tie them down.  They are also known to not be happy in one relationship they will crave more.  I would really confront her, because you deserve the truth about your relationship.  I wish you all the best.|`|Py6s4pf4aa	What sign is she? That might help me..|`|GM8rXT34aa	Ok, ok, I saw your avatar, and I can feel the stress in your words, so calm down, calm down, take a breather, and wait things out. This horoscope is probably trying to be overly accurate. My horoscope tells me things all the time that don't come true. If she plugged in her exact birth info, then you may see a bit of an issue, but otherwise, you shouldn't worry that much. Besides, even if it is right, she may still choose you, anyway. My mom got a horoscope once that turned out accurate, and then later on, from the same source, a different horoscope later on was wrong. You probably shouldn't stress, since it probably isn't as accurate as it claims, and even so, it may not come true or wind up out of your favor.|`|bfjs9wSLaa	if she sent it to you----im sorry, but i am not a phycic, but i know women, and truth it- it's over bud    move on!  she SENT it to you of all things!  now, the question is: do you want to beat her to the punch?

In it, all of the creatures and people of the sidewalk chalk world revolt and find a way to our world. They slay Burt and hang him from one of the magical flying kites and the kids cry as his twitching body flies away. Also the laughin jack*** who we talked about earlier has an aneurysm and falls to the floor, snapping his neck on the coffee table. I think that the chimney sweeps destroy the cartoons by sealing them in a room and filling it with their soot collections and I had to turn the movie off there, that part was a bit disturbing.   Ring any bells?|`|eKxPSMolaa	MARY POPPINS! I love mary poppins :D|`|AFkmdu92aa	its called "mary poppins"!  i am absolutely positive,  hope it helps:)|`|kltRWD81aa	It sounds like Mary Poppins.

I agree with you, I don't know why people are comparing him to Tupac, he has a ghostwriter and stole other peoples songs, Tupac never copied peoples songs, and he actually sounds good and I can understand him. Unlike Lil Wayne, who sounds like some r3tarded robot or something.|`|x2OgEVt3aa	Ha ha, Rap = Crap.    There is your answer to the meaningless rapper (and genre).|`|Py6s4pf4aa	I wouldn't compare them but I like him!|`|BjojDsMsaa	he's terrible. his lines arent that great, they only talk about sex and **** ,his beats aren't original, hes not that amazing. it disgusts me that ppl even consider comparing him to tupac. hes no good.|`|TkhyRHITaa	When people say that Weezy is better or for that matter even close to Tupac is a disgrace. Tupac was a legend, plain and simple. Pac actually rapped about real ****. Pac revolutionized hip hop and took it to a whole different level. His lines were deep and meaningful. I agree with you.

More than often, you are born with that kind of voice. I know, I too I have often dreamed of having her voice.|`|WLYuDrlMaa	You would deff need some vocal training. Dont try to belt without the proper training, , becasue you can hurt your voice, and possibly get nodes.
oUZLZusjaa	It wouldn't "be hell" without a bass, but try listening to some of your favorite songs without bass...they sound empty, almost naked in a way, very uncompleted. You could probably pull it off without bass but bass is an instrument that's easy to learn and hard to master, maybe have one of your guitarists play bass and learn or get someone who actually knows how to play bass guitar to play.  EDIT: Here's a tip, take one of the guitars, turn the tone all the way down on the guitar and the treble and gain all the way down on the amp and the bass all the way up on the amp, it will be a flat bassy sound, it won't sound exactly like a bass guitar would but it would sound close. In fact, this is how Noel Redding played bass on the first Experience album, he didn't know how to play bass so he did what I said and that's how he got the "bass" down on "Are You Experienced?"|`|n3CVPXrVaa	Nawww GET A BASS PLAYER (almost all great songz have bass)|`|8e6z8iUHaa	Any music of any kind needs a bass of some sort, because the bass voice is the foundation of the pyramid. That's like listening to speakers that are blown out. it's all treble, and it doesn't sound good.|`|haRQjh79aa	So as a bassist, I suppose I could be considered an authority. =]  Bass is a crucial rhythm instrument; it carries the beat. You could have a band with no bass (like the White Stripes) but Jack White often down-tunes his guitar to sound like a bass. Songs just sound better with bass in them. Also, it's a very easy instrument to learn the basics to. And considering you do have an extra guitar...|`|o4IHt3EAaa	without bass your music will sound like empty.|`|d0VN2pkgaa	With such a moronic question, I guarantee that you don't know what you mean by "Pop-punk". Just listen to how any half-decent bands utilize a bassline, let alone pop-punk bands like Descedents & Rancid.|`|d4Dvw3fsaa	The Bass brings the Guitar and Drumming together correctly. They are two starkly different sounds and need to be blended somehow. Thus the base between the two is the blender.|`|rXlyHk1Raa	Just think of Iron Maidon - Run To the Hills without Steve Harris. Get a bass player|`|ebxwADDcaa	the music will soud ok but you cant have a band without a bassist.     example: play your ipod through a guitar amp and turn the bass and mid all the way down on the amp. thats what your band will sound like.    a bassist is more important than you think|`|WHcBV7rLaa	I think its a buffer between the percussion and the melody, because the bass keeps the beat and the rythm as well as provides a melodic skeleton, I suppose I could call it, for the guitars to build around. It really holds a song together if you ask me.  Plus, bass intros are the ****.|`|tq5vKKWzaa	It would sound pitchy and high. Bass keeps rhythm and keeps the tone down. If you doubt this, listen to Pig Destroyer. They are one of the few bands I know without a bass, and they are incredibly noisy. I'm not bashing them, they are one of my favorite bands. But unless you're playing grindcore, you need a bass. Or a keyboard. Or you could tune down one guitar to resemble a bass, but I don't think that's what you mean by two guitarists.|`|NM7zcD2jaa	Dude, get a bassist. You have to have one, or your music will just sound like a few kids that just learned how to play an instrument. Bass keeps your music alive. Without bass, everything just sounds empty.     Just turn the rhythm guitarrist into a bassist. No need for 2 guitars. Or, if you're really cool, get the singer to play bass and sing at the same time. That always turns out cool.    Good luck man.|`|hHQIUrNjaa	you cant. You will have way too much treble echo and bass is absolutely necessary. I play bass, and ive heard the rest of my band play with out me, and it sounds ok during solos because my brother is god when it comes to 8 fingering, but otherwise it sounds like crap. Also, people are going to be high at your shows, and the lows of bass make a trip much better      also, pop-punk is literally the worst type of music. ******* scene downs (as we call it, a mosh pit only with scene kids wailing their arms and **** around like they are fighting, and then we come in and kick their asses, and they fight back after then song and break the  1 rule of moshing: after the song, its over and you are friends but during the song you should beat eachother to death)|`|RdbnrFmraa	wouldn't sound good because although drums help with rhythm bass guitar helps with the overall beat of EVERYTHING...so it would sound like hell|`|xwUY2b8Jaa	You don't absolutely require a bass to sound good, but most pop punk bands do use one. The music will sound different without a bass though.

He was just using humor to make light of the sitiuation that was upon him. His death was sad but not surprising considering everyone else who's been killed off of late(Asuma, Itachi, Kakashi). He was a pretty popular character so the writers must of had a damn good reason to kill him off, maybe to introduce new characters or use it a motivation for Naruto. I seriously think Shippudden are trying to kill off all of the older generation to make room for the younger ninja's b/c pretty soon they'll be the leaders of the leaf village. Sadly, that would mean Guy Sensei is next. Whatever the reason, the "pervy sage" will be missed.|`|a6fb6708bba705283e524493764398c5aa	He is dead. The "next book" being called Naruto Uzumaki implies that everything relies on Naruto, now.|`|RS9mkTlvaa	Yeah, he's already dead. The main character of his first book is Naruto. So Minato and Kushina chose that to name their child. The reason why Naruto is Uzumaki not Namikaze is unknown. Jiraiya won't have a next book because he's dead.

LSxBwiFSaa	Yup! And alas!- Its been LIKE this- for Generations now... Now I KNOW You and I probably can think of alot of OTHER ways to spend our Time (quite a few of which could be considerably MORE productive). But it seems to be the "nature" of Teenagers to Waste as MUCH of their formative years listening to music that will be forgotten by the time they're 40, as they can. It seems we've become a Wasteful Culture since the '50's (when Elvis warned Us off His "Blue Suede Shoes...")... And until we start leaning how to use Our Brains for Thinking- again... -the "music" off our mp3 players is ALL the "sense" we're gonna have... And THAT, isn't much... ...  :(|`|vLZlPGEWaa	I understand what you're saying.  What's more annoying though, is when people try to be really original about it.  For example, my friends listen to music i have never heard of, and they are very proud of that.  It's like they think they've done an amazing feat just to be so original, when in fact everyone else has already heard of those bands, and i'm just stupid.  But, really, i'm more annoyed with the originality thing.  And that applies to everything.  One person even tried to tell me how original and unique it was to be a rocker/ indie/ emo/ whatever the hell they call themselves.  It's the most unoriginal thing.  But whatever, now i'm agitated.  Oh by the way, i'm from the US. I only mention it because "flatmates" is a typically british thing to say.|`|X6YY0OS6aa	we are humans we eat, sleep, drink, make money, marry, and have children...why not have some entertainment while we are on this earth.  Music is a way for people to express themselves...music makes people happy..music gives people words for the emotions they are feeling.  Music motivates, music creates.  I love music, I don't just memorize it so I can boast about knowing a lot of bands and songs I memorize it because I truly love singing along and meaning the words from the bottom of my heart.|`|mZOt8oURaa	It's both!You have to understand that music is beautiful.I love it because there is always a song that can explain exactly how I feel or what I'm going through.Even when it comes to love,marriage or heartbreaks.I love the older music very much.Listen to some older different types of music.

I'd cut a hole somewhere in the foundation.  Concrete isn't that hard to get through.  The prick wouldn't think to bullet proof that.   While that went on I'd weld all the doors shut.

qcB23QvZaa	Yeah i don't think you have to be born in the u.s.    Did you watch it tonight?    They are holding auditions in Puerto Rico. So those people weren't born in the United States.

That would be discrimination.|`|cuqHAp8Qaa	No, you don't. You just need to be a citizen. Remember Michael and Carly last year?|`|NwYwLdsNaa	Rules  Singers are not permitted to have any current record deals or talent management agreements (though they may have had one at some point in the past). They must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents eligible to work full-time and, for the first three seasons, had to be 16 to 24 years of age on October 19 of the year of audition. Since the fourth season, the upper age limit was raised to 28 with an earlier cutoff date, August 4, to attract more mature and diverse contestants. Also, singers with any previous formal training are turned away during early auditions.    Others who are ineligible to compete include those who have made it into the top 40 contestants in past seasons (or the top 50 of season 7), and people employed by affiliates of Fox, FremantleMedia or 19 Entertainment (including sponsors, subsidiaries and parent companies). Even if a person is eligible, he or she may not have a chance to audition or be seen because the show can see only a limited number of people in each city.    Auditioning contestants must bring with them to the audition a valid proof of age and work eligibility, such as a birth certificate and driver's license, a passport, or a green card, and those under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. All auditioning contestants are required to print out a copy of the release form (available on the show's web site) to fill out and turn in at the audition in order to grant permission to be seen and heard by the producers' cameras. Contestants who are found to have given false information are disqualified. After auditioning - regardless of the outcome (even if eliminated on the very first cut) - contestants are under contract with the show until three months after the final episode.[2]    In an interview with Anderson Cooper on the CBS TV current affairs show 60 Minutes on March 17, 2007 (repeated in extended format on CNN's AC 360 program on March 27, 2007), judge Simon Cowell openly declared that the underlying primary purpose of the Idol franchise (including American Idol) was for 19 Entertainment (the parent corporation that produces the Idol TV shows) to discover new singing talent that can be signed to recording agreements that the corporation maintains with a major record company (Sony/BMG), and benefit from the record sales of contestants and winners who are exposed to the worldwide marketplace through the TV shows. Cowell indicated that revenue from recordings by performers associated with the Idol franchise has already exceeded US $100 million. 19 Entertainment also retains exclusive right of refusal for management and merchandising of any contestant. Exercising management rights is at the sole discretion of 19 Entertainment; in the alternative the contestant performer is free to pursue his or her own career

(I dedicate songs to everyone)  I gave Jack & Tony "You've Got a Friend in Me"  from Toy Story.|`|7L0PFTXKaa	I think that Chloe does love Jack--but not in the way that she loved Morris.  Heavens, I hope that the writers don't have them get together.  Everyone Jack loves dies.    I heard that FBI Agent Renee Walker and Jack will get together though.|`|MW5EJxKNaa	Yeah, I don't think they would get together.  Jack is too consumed in himself to get with her.  Plus, he has already lost many of the people he has loved; I don't think he would risk another.  Chloe probably loves Jack (I've thought so for forever), but I don't think the writers will do that.|`|qaQMM4sxaa	I see them more as friends, you know. I don't think the writers would do that. Not this season, anyway.
yK7umQhoaa	You can get one if you have awesome credit along with a beautiful job. Which if you had that why would you need the loan or to go to school in the first place. So I guess the answer is yes....but no. :)|`|e28P8gWraa	Not unless you have great credit and a great job for over a year.|`|ShqeO50haa	Yes you do, looks like its McDonalds for you for the next 40 years...|`|zzivfC0qaa	Not with this economy I think.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	No.  You do not need a cosigner to get a student loan.  Some banks will make your interest rate slightly higher if you do not have a cosigner but it is usually not too bad.  You can (and should) also shop around at different banks and find who will give you the lowest interest rate.|`|AA11394813	Fill out the FASFA. Government loans are much better. A cosigner is someone who will pay your loan back if you don't. Since school is not a real object that they can take back and resell if you don't pay. They will need something of value in case you don't pay.|`|WNB4Vojsaa	get a pretend co-signer. you can get 100k|`|55ba826da159dd00bcca0f4fbb24c899aa	It is possible, you may need collateral or a down payment. You at least have to have decent credit for that amount.  Call a few different local banks or go in and ask!

6hFK44Bnaa	Sarah, a 29-year-old special needs teacher, is working in her class when she coughs up blood and collapses. The team initially suspects a problem with her blood and orders a bleeding time test, which shows a clotting problem later shown to be abnormal platelets. After this, ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) and lymphoma are considered. House orders the team to start Sarah on methotrexate for the ITP and also wants to give her total body irradiation (which is not a standard treatment for ITP).    Cameron has been hired by Cuddy as a temporary replacement so that Cuddy can spend more time with her new baby Rachel. One of Cameron's newfound duties is keeping House in line. This is why House supposedly wants to irradiate his patient - he has no intention of actually doing so; rather, he simply wants to test Cameron's limits. Cameron allows House to perform the procedure, even though it is not necessary. Also, the methotrexate is not working. House therefore has his team double the dose and add prednisone, as well as fake the radiation treatment, putting Sarah in the room but not actually irradiating her. While she is being "irradiated", she needs to urinate. When she gets up, she collapses. Thirteen and Taub discover that she has no pulse and defibrillate her.    Meanwhile, Wilson visits Cuddy. Cuddy reveals that she is having trouble bonding with Rachel. Wilson tells her to just give it time. Also, Foreman is troubled by his discovery that Thirteen is on a placebo, not the actual experimental drug, and consults with Chase about surreptitiously switching her to the real thing. Chase tells him that this is unwise. Foreman also goes to Cameron, who suggests likewise.    The team meets to discuss Sarah's new symptoms. Tests revealed no structural heart defects, and after some deliberations the possibility of cold agglutinin disease is raised. House wants to give the patient an ice bath to confirm, and goes to Cameron again. While this is happening, Cuddy stops by at the hospital. She has found out about Cameron's permissiveness with House and chastises her. House barges in while the two are talking. He brings up Cuddy's bonding problem (of which Wilson told him), and suggests giving Rachel up. Cuddy leaves, and Cameron tells House to perform a test on a sample of the blood before trying the cold bath. The blood clots when exposed to cold, but when the patient is put in the cold bath, her vital signs remain normal.    However, while she is in the cold bath, Sarah recounts a story about how she became a special needs teacher. Six years ago, she transposed a room number and went to the wrong class. House decides that this is a sign of a left hippocampal lesion due to multiple sclerosis and wants a brain biopsy, but the team is skeptical. Kutner suspects a pancreatic tumor and wants to perform an ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography). Both go to Cameron, who sides with House but orders him to scan the patient's brain first. The MRI is normal, but when Kutner performs the ERCP, Sarah begins to have trouble breathing - she has pleural effusions. House now suspects equine encephalitis and tries to get approval for a nerve conduction test (which requires cutting off the top of Sarah's skull). He goes to Cameron again, who stands up to House and denies the procedure. Thirteen and Foreman go to the school to look for any sign of equine encephalitis but find nothing.    After this, House goes to Cameron again, and pressures her into letting him run the nerve conduction study (and in fact she even assists in the procedure). However, a skeptical Kutner (who believes it is lymphoma in the spleen and wants a splenectomy) calls Cuddy and puts her on speakerphone in the middle of the procedure. Cuddy talks to House and the team while simultaneously dealing with her crying baby. Sarah reveals that she is becoming annoyed by the crying, but her blood pressure falls significantly, instead of rising as expected, and the test is ended. The annoyance intrigues House, however, as it seems that Sarah is normally very tolerant of annoyance. While the procedure is ongoing, Cuddy desperately shouts at Rachel, asking her what she wants. Rachel abruptly stops crying, and it seems that Cuddy has overcome her bonding problems. Also, Foreman, having asked everyone else he knows, goes to House about switching Thirteen's drugs. House tells him that rationally it is not worth it, but also reminds Foreman that love makes people do stupid things.    House is stumped by Sarah's annoyance and spends some time pondering it. While this is happening, Cuddy stops in his office with Rachel. Rachel throws up on House's shirt, which induces him to rant about the development and evolution of man. Suddenly, House realizes what is wrong with Sarah: a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The ductus arteriosus allows blood to bypass the lungs while developing (since there is no air and the lungs are filled with fluid). When the infant is born, it|`|yWuDSCGpaa	http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/sho...|`|ezTQHwAVaa	He cures the teacher

She looks like sunshine,  and she smells like rain  Was floating through life,  then along you came    As we lie beneath the stars  I think of you,  your in my heart  It really makes me wonder,  if you'll ever be mine,  just want to get there in time.    Thoughts they change,  and feelings they rearrange,  It's hard to recall,  how it felt at first,  but your so much more.    [Take a slight pause at the end of each line, like a little breath, it'll help your song flow better, and sound better when you sing it, not to mention make it so much easier and you won't run out of breath.]

There is no life changing event going to happen, that was a coincidence, that he had the same birthday.  I believe in zodiacs and the characteristics of your sign but I do not believe in horoscopes that are written out to make money.  Sometimes we can believe something so much that it can actually feel like it is real.    I wish you all the best, and I wouldn't waste my money on horoscope readings.|`|WgomxNOOaa	wow that's just so weird, maybe it has to do something with numerology. i dint know what you should do in these cases, but i would probably wait for anther coincidence hust to see if anything will make more sense. like maybe you'll time travel on you birthday.

AA11474014	Wow - thanks for reminding me about this movie! I remember watching it a couple years ago - it was on tv. I loved it! I'm not a fan of anime films either but this movie was really intriguing. It explores part of your imagination you didn't know about. It reminds me of a movie I watched a child called 'GiGi' ...that one is also fun.|`|P2BjtJnUaa	yes they are both wonderful.  have you seen Howl's Moving Castle?|`|P8gGMlbIaa	For Myaizaki movie I still prefer Laputa and Naussica.|`|BwdYG7q6aa	I'm not really big on anime films but i have to admit that Hayao Miyazaki creates some amazing movies. The aren't your typical after-school anime cartoon hour. His films have intriguing plots and characters that deliver a fantastic viewing experience|`|8nCbCQwTaa	yes|`|oq8F1qfUaa	i love all miyazaki's films! spirited away, howls and princess mononke are my favorite. but i love them all!|`|dsgXLjiUaa	Yes I loved it, it made me cry! Did you you know chihiro forgets all about haku and her adventures? When I found that out it made me cry more. Now whenever I watch the movie I feel a tension. My stomach would make flips since they never got together again. I love the song at the part where haku tells her to go an not look back. The song reminds me that something is ending and something new is beggininng. I cry whenever I hear that song because the ending part is when her adventures end and the beggining is when she comes out a better person. I wish kiyazaki could make a 2nd movie.|`|rvrGhvKCaa	Spirited away is good and Princess Mononoke and Howl's moving castle. But I really like that one with the big cat but I can't remember the name.|`|06382CnOaa	is spirited away the one with the baby that says "play with me or i'll break ur arm!" xD i think it is that was funny

(not drug coke, hehehe)|`|gZ5m3o96aa	yea definaly coke is bubblier or somthing|`|xlhn4nKbaa	I dont think so|`|Zf3M1S4Naa	Yes     Pepsi Is Sweeter . And Flat     Coke is Less Sweet And More Bubbly     Other than that , theres not much difference :]|`|GGpkMLwUaa	Pepsi has more sugar.|`|ShaUAySvaa	really i can't tell  slightly  but does it matter    Coke vs. Pepsi  According  research it has been proven that the difference between Coke and Pepsi really is all in your head. Apparently the popularity of Coke's brand image causes people to think Coca-Cola itself tastes better, even though it really doesn't taste very different from Pepsi. As the article says: When asked to taste blind, they showed no preference. However, when the participants were shown company logos before they drank, the Coke label, the more famous of the two, had a dramatic impact: three-quarters of the tasters declared they preferred Coke. I've long suspected this. Personally I can't taste any difference between Coke and Pepsi, but I have a friend who swears passionately that there's a huge difference. Now I can show him this research to prove that he's simply been brainwashed by advertising. Oh, and the Pepsi Taste Test also turns out to be nothing but hot air: The findings suggest there is no scientific basis for claims made during the Pepsi ad campaign in which testers purportedly chose Pepsi over Coke when they were not told what they were drinking.

MX0s76pzaa	Question 1: How do you feel about Light's motifs in the anime?  Amused, it's pretty interesting to see what he comes up with next!    Question 2: You find a Death Note and read the rules. You become aware that the notebook works. How do you feel?  Crept out, that's a scary amount of power to be held within a notebook...    Question 3: You find yourself in a very tight situation with the Death Note, and are faced with the dilemma of making the Shinigami eyes deal. Which of these would best describe your feelings?  If it has to be done, I guess I'd just go for it. Besides, the eyes could be very useful.    Question 4: What sort of people would you want to kill with a Death Note?  Evil people.    Question 5: Are you currently in a relationship?  No, not right now.    Question 6: How popular would you say you are?  Not really, only have a few good friends, if any.    Question 7: Out of the following which do you most enjoy in life?  Winning!      Question 8: What is your attitude towards work?  I put in a lot of effort, and set myself high aims.  and  I find it hard to relax until its done, and put in a lot of concentration.    Question 9: If you were walking along the street and someone punched you, how would you react?  Demand an explanation! Walk off afterwards, do not conciliate.      Question 10: What would you most like to have achieved in the future?  A good job.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	Question 1: How do you feel about Light's motifs in the anime?

It's a bit different then other people's surveys which is a good change. :)    Question 1: How do you feel about Light's motifs in the anime?     Bitter, he is taking a foolish attitude towards life, and has bad motifs.       Question 2: You find a Death Note and read the rules. You become aware that the notebook works. How do you feel?     Anxious, you know I think some people deserve to be punished.     Question 3: You find yourself in a very tight situation with the Death Note, and are faced with the dilemma of making the Shinigami eyes deal. Which of these would best describe your feelings?      I'd give it some serious consideration, but I don't really think I'd go for it unless it was extremely important and I was very confident of my decision.     Question 4: What sort of people would you want to kill with a Death Note?     People who heavily break the law and act with injustice.     Question 5: Are you currently in a relationship?     No, not right now.     Question 6: How popular would you say you are?   Does it matter?      Not really, only have a few good friends, if any.      Question 7: Out of the following which do you most enjoy in life?      Apples!     Question 8: What is your attitude towards work?      I find it hard to relax until its done, and put in a lot of concentration.     Question 9: If you were walking along the street and someone punched you, how would you react?     If I had the Death Note Id write their name in it, thatll show them.     Question 10: What would you most like to have achieved in the future?   Power.     A good job.    That's it, I'm done, so later on!|`|e8o2eP6Zaa	Question 1: How do you feel about Light's motifs in the anime?    Good, I agree with him cleansing the world.

Amused, it's pretty interesting to see what he comes up with next!       Question 2: You find a Death Note and read the rules. You become aware that the notebook works. How do you feel?

Which of these would best describe your feeling  There's no way I'd give up half my lifespan, there's got to be another way around the problem, no matter how tough it is.

Yes.    Question 6: How popular would you say you are?  Does it matter?  Popularity is subjective; though I like to pretend I "run this sh!t," as my friend once put it. Lol.

Its very boring, I wish it were more interesting.    Question 9: If you were walking along the street and someone punched you, how would you react?  Scream, complain at the person and storm off.

Power.          **I think in this case, "motive," from the first question, would be a lot more fitting. Lol. Grammar weirdly makes me feel smart.

U8aXa8xEaa	I don't think that Ben is gonna have to find Desmond.  Desmond is going to find Ben when he goes to see Daniel's mother.  I think Dan's mom is gonna be the white haired woman that was working with Ben.    Yes I believe the island is 3 years behind the O6 in LA.  That is why Locke can be alive and well on the island.  (except for the bullet wound, that is)  and be lying dead in coffin in Los Angeles.|`|AA10196640	I agree with by Vikkip67  that the white haired woman with Ben is Farraday's mother, but I also think that she is the chic that was pointing a gun at Daniel that he thought he recognized.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	Remember the island isn't through with you until it's ready to be through with you...so the Island is definetly calling Des back for  bigger purpose.  I think Penny is a low priority on Ben's list. Getting the 6 back is his main priority.    The island is traveling through time. Everything off the island is present day. So the only ones effected by time travel are those on the island. I think next week we'll find charcters interacting with each other. So the whispers we have been hearing in past seasons are actually the time travelers warning the survivors of dangers ahead.|`|oq0jpqAgaa	Penny will die in about 12 episodes.  Desmond will seek revenge on Benjamin and this will cause him to return to the island.  Also Ben is just doing everything that hes doing so that he can find a way back to the island to be leader again.|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Perhaps if Ben kills Penny then Desmond will have a real impetus to go back to the island. To kill Ben! I'm not sure Ben would kill Penny. It might just be an idle threat. Time is an ever shifting thing on the island, so it is uncertain as to whether the people on the island are living in the present or three years in the past. Honestly, I'm not sure why the people with small children (Kate, Sun, Desmond) would go back to the island since there is such a risk of death and never coming home.|`|8Kwwgtvlaa	Ok I got it all figured out but it will probably really gross ya out..... Penny gave birth to her own father and Penny, Desmond and Little Charlie will go back to the island and that's how big Charlie Widmore will make it back to the island|`|py0DpCh4aa	Okay, this episode just totally foreshadowed that Desmond had to go to the Island i mean penny even tell him not to,   Yes I agree.      but then that means Ben has to find Desmond, but Desmond is with Penny and when Ben sees her he will kill her and then Desmond will never go back for sure cus he will hold a grudge and and its really confusing!!!!  Well Ben is in LA where Farday's Mother is & desmond was told to find Farday's mother...(I suspect farday's mother is the woman we saw talking to Ben last week....)    please....confuse me!  I'm confused too    or do i have my facts straight?  No idea.      and also, is it that the people on the Island are still three years Behind the Oceanic 6 cus when it started it showed it was immediately after the island moved, and then time start moving and this i am also confused about.  The people on the island are moving in time.........|`|5NJbpdUpaa	Does Desmond really have to go back to the Island tho?  He wasn't one of the Oceanic 6 or more importantly, he wasn't even in the plane crash!    & Why would Ben kill Penny?

Noooo....:(|`|CaYBmaN3aa	good ty for asking|`|NEAdKB6haa	XD  now it's stuck in my head     My day is going pretty good, considering I woke up an hour ago.  plus there's no school today  *woot woot*  =]|`|cesTfRKPaa	That song is amazing.  April 29nth i will be seeing All Time Low!    But if it wasn't for that concert i wish i could be six feet under the stars.  This month has been so depressing.

It's some pretty confusing stuff, so I'm almost sure I failed it.|`|Gslf19Uvaa	oh, definitely. no better place than up there in the twinkliin sky :)    my day was alright. then my friend told me about a boy i like who maybe knocked up this one girl...something that i really hope is a rumor...  but other than that it was glorious :))      ^^^^^^^ was that seriously your VERY FIRST coffee??? oh my freaking gosh...i swear im an alcoholic to coffee.|`|g2GogSALaa	Mmmm yess (: I absolutely adore that song. It's been stuck in my head too. Probably because I listen to it pretty much..every night now :|    My day started out pretty sucky. It was all dark and dreary and cold outside. Then I had this Latin quiz which I didn't know about D:    But it got better after that:]|`|CGPhWIfEaa	AHH YES! I love that song!!    It was pretty good, thanks for asking, and how was yours?|`|9FLNHJtvaa	Lol.  Thts creepy i was just listening to that song  XD      My day was okay  How about you?|`|luVK5cHqaa	Me too. So I got tired of having it stuck in my head and deleted it off my iPod today. MUAHAHAHA!    My day was very nifty! I felt quite woogly doogly. =]|`|CaWyn751aa	No I'm 6 ft above.    It was nice.

How was yours?|`|0P4rtupoaa	I'm kinda claustrophobic.  it would be 6 inches from my head though.  I would be in over my head XD    I got into a friendly argument with this girl who likes atl.  she says acoustic six feet smashes acoustic dear maria and i was like nuh uhhhhh and she was like uh huhhhhhh    haha    star 4 u!|`|JQp2Siskaa	That's a great song but it would probably be annoying all week.    Barley started. But so far so good. I've been drinking chocolate milk and watching cartoons. Ahh, the simple life.|`|gj1rzc4Gaa	yes, me and alex gaskarth are happily six feet under the stars   and YOU cant make us leave !       my day was ok i guesss, im sad tho cuz i have dance classs and i cant dance
s6ekS4IQaa	I would want either a comedy/drama (like most of our favorite shows!) with some relatively unknown stars, OR  A reality show!!!

I guess kinda like tool academy but with a different kind of boyfriend.. not the douchebag kinds but the kinds that need to GROW THE **** UP D  Sorry im a little pissed off right now. My man of 4 years is being an asshole and just ugh.

BwdYG7q6aa	I think all those characters from the Dark Knight just magically becoming super villains is a little hard to perceive. If you look at the comic books batman met most of alter egos of the villians after they had turn to a life of crime. With the Dark Knight ending with Batman as a villian in the eyes of the Gotham's citizens i don't think it would be wise for Warner Bros. to have all Bruce Waynes colleages to suddenly turn against him.|`|Dnf4ijdJaa	woahh that is so cool! i never realized that but it actually does make sense! lol :]]|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	I don't know enough - or care enough - about the Batman universe to know if these theories are reasonable or not. I think that most likely the people are making the assumption these characters will appear in future movies and looking for characters that might evolve into them.     I almost get the impression they expect the Christopher Nolan movies to follow the same basic pattern as the series started by Tim Burton.|`|z35zX9FFaa	GOD I DINT EVEN BOTHER TO READ THAT DARN THANG GOSH U WROTE ALOT sorry for shoutin|`|EsnFmcMFaa	i dont know how u ever got that idea|`|EfAV3x9Yaa	He explains: "Look at the clues: Joshua Harto (pictured left, who played Coleman Reese) is the Riddler. The scene with him planning to blackmail Bruce Wayne is where he develops his hatred for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Not only this, but his name is Mr. Reese... "Mysteries". An alias of the Riddler    Why would he hate Bruce Wayne when Wayne saved his life by using his lambo as a cushion, remember the scene when the joker gave them an hour to kill Mr. Reece or he'd blow the hospitals up.  After the crash they eye ball each other, i took that as a thank you from Mr. Reece.    Isnt William Fichtner a bit tall for the penguin, remember the penguin whenever used in either a tv show or film was short (Danny DeVito short)!!!!|`|DCfRc6GPaa	I'm pretty sure that the dark knight(film not batman himself) tells you that the joker is being controlled by the riddler indicating the riddler is an already established villain, which makes it possible that mr resse is the riddler but he might not be.    Hints at catwoman being the next come from morgan freeman in the film, Didnt see anything hinting at the penguin though, but it's almost certain that the riddler will be the next villain.|`|gxkG1Gbyaa	I like the idea that Joshua Harto could become the Riddler.  I've heard rumors that Johnny Depp or David Tennant are other candidates for the role, but Chris Nolan's first Batman movie, "Batman Begins" (2005) introduced the Joker (by name only) at the end, so perhaps Nolan is doing something similar with TDK ("The Dark Knight" - 2008).  Too bad Heath Ledger is gone.    Incidentally, William Fichtner is a cool actor.  He was effective in "Contact" (1997) and "Heat" (1995).
lQaeb2wNaa	Actually, I would like to be 6 years old again.|`|PEPWFGNGaa	Lol- nice one|`|oRQQRGlVaa	That was funny, I feel sorry for the guy though, he really went out of his way to make her happy.|`|uzXwM0Qzaa	Another moral of the story: A woman is never satisfied.|`|yDoaHhskaa	lol|`|X9H77A9xaa	lmao, thats hilarious
42wJ0nTRaa	oh my god casey you ask so many freaking questions!!  you are one of my contacts, and it shows on my page when one of my contacts asked a new question, and they are allllll from you...  about heath ledger, or 10 things i hate about you  *sigh*    and to answers your question: i have no idea.|`|oKvyaIPSaa	yes
CTVkz71aaa	they list deaths that have happened in the year since the last oscars. not just stars but anyone of note involved in the industry. heath ledger will probably win an oscar postumously.|`|7UKJY0v0aa	i think they will. I miss heath:( He was one of those actors that are just amazing...|`|qOKFuXfLaa	they probably will .... most shows do
j0fqSGt3aa	Only if they have seen images before (only if they weren't blind at birth) thus they can "imagine" images that they've seen before|`|hJ1MmQAIaa	wow. thats a really good question.  i suppose if they were blind from birth they wouldnt know what anything looks like to dream.   But if they had gone blind after being able to see they would have those thoughts to dream about.   but idk.|`|aF6enwCAaa	Yes, most likely. However, if they have never seen anything before, it wouldn't look like anything recognizable. It might be a collaboration of colors, of which they do not know. This is because dreaming is subconscious and you can also hear sounds which they would have no problem hearing unless they were deaf as well.|`|BOrQXRo7aa	well, i'm not blind, nor have i ever been blind, and i dont really expect to be blind. but assuming that they've not always been blind, i believe they probably can because they can remember what things look like, if they can remember what things look like. if they've been blind since birth or a very early age, probably not, how can they see what they've never seen?|`|QNSz3dqtaa	Yes, even though they don't really know what something looks like in reality their minds create what something could look like by the way it feels or what kind of smell something give off their minds create what it may look like to them.|`|8nm2psyKaa	DUDE I am F**Ked up and now you got me thinkin...thats crazy....I gotta go find a blind person....|`|fEfNcumxaa	maybe, but they sure get wet dreams|`|kVm2pdxlaa	Yes and they can see in color. I know some blind people who told me this.|`|IVna6e8Maa	My guess would be if they've been blind since birth, no they can't, but if they became blind (through an accident, etc.), then yes they can.  But whether they do or not I don't know.|`|AA11369490	hmm, thats a good question. they dont know what anything looks liek so what do they see|`|De6n2MaIaa	if they were born blind, no.  if they were once able to see, yes.    dreams are made up of memories and imagination.|`|UtCkgs18aa	Probably|`|IKs0my9aaa	Yep..they dream that there is a cure for blindness|`|D4OCM8yUaa	yes they can! It is in your imagination|`|OAcKN5XRaa	yeah because nobody can see when they are sleeping|`|LEAx00NEaa	good question

oK6yK1R9aa	I do not know if the songs I'm gonna put on this answer will count as "good" for you (coz I don't know which genre of music you prefer), but here are some of my favourite songs used in an Anime.    "Waltz" by Suneohair (Honey & Clover I ED)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEPBzWEza...    "Sakana" by Spitz (Honey & Clover I insert song)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxFkD2a87...

Death Note, the opening and closing songs are awesome.|`|KKxX5wszaa	These songs are really relaxing and mellow beat. I really like them, and they are the only songs from Anime shows that I personally like. It's called Sumrai Champloo, by Nujabes. Check it out. Just type in Nujabes in the artist, then just click one of the songs. All of their songs are good, so it doesn't really matter which one you choose! I hoped that I helped you!|`|PUYbzKkFaa	hi^_^ this is my Japanise Friend   http://www.youtube.com/user/shihoinyorui...  he is an expert in anime and song u can find a lot of good songs or directly ask him Rozen Maiden is Great  u also can see the majors artist in op and ost anime soundtrack  and he is in possesion of the new realized animes   hope it helps u ^^|`|ZaFreVDhaa	the theme song from Evangellion. I think it's called "cruel angel's requim" or somthing like that. that show had great music, but that was really the only one in it with words. the others were just instrumentals.    Yuyu hakoso had a great opening too, the first season.|`|tcDoaqQXaa	ZanZu billy ,the second closing theme to death note is awesome,   The opening to Chrono Crusade is really good  1/2 from Kenchin is really good  What's up people from death note is good  God  knows from The melencholy of Haurhi Suzamia is awesome  All the background music to mai hime is (or my hime) is so sweet and technoish
4dmnQaGDaa	E9S4's "Muse To My Ears". Great song!
4JQUUrX1aa	i dont think there are that many characters.. and a few of them were killed off in the last episode anyways... leading back to almost the same crew they started with with a couple extras that joined along the way.. like speedster girl. i dont know why theres so much criticism. you compare heroes to the 1 million cop/crime dramas csi.. csi miami.. ny.. law and order..cold case.. mentalist.. life on mars..     the shows i love are the unique dramas that have a continuous story line thats not completely resolved like those crime dramas..  lost is fanastic.. prison break is great... and 24 finally is moving in the right direction. heroes is getting new writers and direction anyways from the guy who was doin pushing daisies.. nothing to worry about.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	I think the problem isn't that there are too many characters, but they are too scattered.  Lost works because the characters are all in large groups together, while in Heroes they're all off on their own.    Jeph Loeb and Jesse Alexander, who were in charge of the writers on Heroes, were fired a few months ago.  They were in charge of the first few episodes of the new volume, but didn't get to finish Fugitives.  Mark Verheiden, one of the writers for Battlestar Galactica, joined the writing staff around that time.  Bryan Fuller, who was one of the producers in season 1, was hired back as well, although he didn't come on until they were filming episode 20 and won't have much of an effect this season.  In short, the second half of season 3 may be better due to some new blood, and hopefully season 4 will be back on track.|`|AA11247080	dont know but there both are good shows|`|t9zEzx3naa	you're right. heroes is unintentionally confusing because there are too many people to keep track of. At least you can understand Lost and just focus on a couple people at a time.|`|6hFK44Bnaa	There are only a few chacters, plus a couple more, like Daphne.    agree with shadowboat

090Uv4sKaa	"Hello" by Evanescence.    I first heard it (and the rest of the album "Fallen") back in 2002, at highschool. At the time my musical tastes were scattered, I was still looking for the music I really loved. The moment I heard Evanescence, something clicked into place. They have helped me deal with difficult emotions, introduced me into a whole new way of life as well as leading me on to such amazing bands as Lacuna Coil, Within Temptation, Nightwish...    I also have memories of a dear friend (who I have not spoken to for many years now) performing it at my current college. A memory I do not want to forget.    I owe a lot to that song.    xxx|`|8xHNzwUEaa	Alan Parsons - Ignorance Is Bliss|`|BRiBmVbXaa	2pac = me against the world    2pac = letter to my unborn child    2pac = life goes on    2pac = dear mama    barry white = what am i gonna do    lionel richie = truly    maxi priest  ft shabba ranks = house call    bob marley = shes gone    bob marley = waitin in vain    marvin gaye = lets get it on    lionel richie and diana ross  = endless love    george michael and aretha franklin = knew you were waiting for me    tina turner = whats love got to do with it    tina turner = missing you    tina turner = when the heartache is over    whitney houston = run to you    gabrielle = give me a little more time    soul 2 soul = keep on movin    righteous brothers = unchained melody|`|rTTwH9Unaa	MMMMbop by Hanson, changed my life forever.|`|TdppsvJ7aa	idk but my fav. song is love story by Taylor Swft!|`|hjjmcbbPaa	MASTER EXPLODER TENACIOUS D OH AND IM A WIGGER(THE SONG)LMAO|`|F2jJu5CMaa	I love, Love story by taylor swift.  it's so sweet tellign the story of romeo and juliet, but she gives it a happy ending and it gave me hope.   I also love "a place in this world" by taylor swift. it's a song that she wrote when she was 14 or something about how she doesn't know what she wants to do when she grows up. it reminded me that there other people in the world that have that same worry as me and the only way to get through it is to work hard for myself.|`|SZEK4yM9aa	A Change is Gonna Come by Sam Cooke|`|AA11965574	Simple Plan:    Welcome to my life  and  Crazy    Both things songs have help me understand who I am, and the kind of world I live in.

yaaNbLeyaa	That's a hard question to answer!  I think "Fawlty Towers" is funnier since it doesn't have the variety of skits like "Benny Hill", which can be hit or miss.  I just wish there were more "Fawlty Tower" episodes - there aren't very many.|`|dca208cdd9182f335b618e61db92ef70aa	While it depends if one finds silliness for silliness' sake and scantily clad women running around funny or if one finds clever jokes and a cast full of funny and talented characters funny. In my opinion, Fawlty Towers all the way.|`|ZpZI15POaa	Fawlty Towers is funnier, but I love jokes that involve scantily clad women (Benny Hill) more.|`|wMh38OzVaa	benny hill|`|JSryPP8faa	Benny Hill.|`|AA10481071	Benny Hill|`|mxrlZEweaa	Benny Hill|`|0jtZi1jVaa	Fawlty Towers!

Great Concert|`|0wzrnW3Eaa	Testament... the epitome of the "Thrash Metal" genre.  One of the first thrash bands to hit the scene, and still to this day one of the heaviest, meanest, and fastest to dawn guitars and gut-wrenching vocals (Chuck Billy).  Testament, one of my personal favorite thrash bands, has a reputation that rivals fellow late 80's-early 90's thrash bands such as Anthrax, Exodus, and of course, Slayer, but Testament is also a good example of repetitive riffs and so-called "traditional" solos.  Only truly enjoyable if you don't particularly like expanding your horizons as far as music goes.

CrAwmz65aa	Here are a few of my favorites:    If you're crawling through the desert and you see a good violist, a bad violist, and Santa Claus, which one should you approach for help?  The bad violist.  The other two are hallucinations.    A violist had three visitors over for a string quartet rehearsal.  On the coffee table was a jigsaw puzzle.  The violist said, "It tooki me six months to finish that puzzle."  One of the visitors said, "Why so long?"  The violist said, "What do you mean, why so long?  The label on the box said three to four years."    A viola player attended a piano recital. After the recital, he told the piano teacher that he enjoyed all of the recital, but he especially enjoyed the piece which started with a trill.    The piano teacher said, "What? There wasn't a piece which started with a trill."    The viola player said, "Sure there was! Remember? There was a piece which started:    http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v500/p...    PS I play the viola, too.|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	One or two that don't appear in bhfcbabe's excellent list:    1) What's the difference between a viola player and a Cornish pasty?  A Cornish pasty is only half vegetable.    A viola player sat sobbing in his chair just before a rehearsal. The conductor walks over and says "What on earth is wrong?". The viola plyer replies "The bass trombonist just let one of my strings down." The conductor asks "Well, what's the problem?" to which the viola player retorts "He won't tell me which one!"    And, just for the record, just as the best Irish jokes I've ever heard have been told to me by Irish people, the best viola jokes have come to me from violist friends.|`|dBLdXm7gaa	http://www.mit.edu/~jcb/viola-jokes.html    That website seems to have a fair amount.

"Impossible!" says the doctor. "Show me."   The redhead took her finger, pushed on her left shoulder and screamed, then she pushed her elbow and screamed even more. She pushed her knee and screamed; likewise she pushed her ankle and screamed. Everywhere she touched made her scream.   The doctor said, "You're not really a redhead, are you?   "Well, no" she said, "I'm actually a blonde."   "I thought so," the doctor said. "Your finger is broken."      3 construction guys were working on a skyscraper, up on the 40th floor.   At lunch, the bald guy said "Every day my wife packs me a tuna sandwich. If there's tuna again today, I'm gonna jump off this building!". He checks it & sure enough it's tuna again so old baldy jumps.   The redhead then says "Every day I get a cheese sandwich for lunch from my wife. If it's cheese again today then I'm jumping off here, too!". Sure enough, it's cheese so the redheaded guy jumps off.   Then the blond guy says "I always get a jelly sandwich. If it's jelly again then I'm jumping, too!". He checks & it's jelly so he jumps.   At the memorial service for the 3 guys, their wives are talking about this.   Both the bald guy's wife & the redhead's wife said the same thing, "I don't understand why my husband jumped. If I had know he wanted something else to eat for lunch, I'd have gave it to him.".   Then the blond man's wife says " I don't understand why my husband jumped. He always made his own lunch.".      A Russian, an American, and a Blonde were talking one day. The Russian said, "We were the first in space!"   The American said, "We were the first on the moon!"   The Blonde said, "So what? We're going to be the first on the sun!"   The Russian and the American looked at each other and shook their heads. "You can't land on the sun, you idiot! You'll burn up!" said the Russian.   To which the Blonde replied, "We're not stupid, you know. We're going at night!"         A blonde woman was speeding down the road in her little red sports car and was pulled over by a woman police officer, who was also blonde. The blonde cop asked to see the blonde drivers license. She dug through her purse and was getting progressively more agitated. "What does it look like?" she finally asked  The police woman replied "It's square and it has your picture on it." The driver finially found a square mirror in her purse , looked at it and handed it tothe policewoman. "Here it is " she said.    The blonde officer looked at the mirror, then handed it back saying "Okay, you can go. I didn't realize you were a cop."      Two blondes living in Oklahoma were sitting on a bench talking....... and one blonde says to the other, "Which do you think is farther away... Florida or the moon?"   The other blonde turns and says "Helloooooooooo, can you see Florida ?????"       A blonde was bragging about her knowledge of state capitals. She proudly says, "Go ahead, ask me, I know all them." A friend says, "OK, what's the capital of Wisconsin?" The blonde replies, "Oh, that's easy: W."       A blonde went to electronics store and she asked, "How is much is this TV?"   The salesman said, "Sorry, we don't sell to blondes."   The next day she came back as a brunette. She asked the salesman how much the TV was.   He said, "Sorry, we don't sell to blondes."   The next day she came back as a red head and asked the salesman how much the TV was.   He said,  "Sorry we don't sell to blondes."  She replied, " I came in here as a brunette and a red head. How do you know I am a blonde?"   "Because that is not a TV, it's a microwave      A blonde calls Delta Airlines and asks, "Can you tell me how long it'll take to fly from San Francisco to New York City?" The agent replies, "Just a minute..." "Thank you," the blonde says, and hangs up.      Three blondes walk into a bar and ask the bartender for three shots of tequila. He looks at them and says "OK" and pours their shots. They all clink glasses and yell "51 days!" Then they proceed to slam the shots, looking very self-satisfied. They look back to the bartender and decide to order another round. This time they pick up the glasses again and, more gleefully yell Only 51 days!" The bartender finally can't stand wondering what they are talking about and asks them what they mean by Only 51 days. One of the blondes looks at him and says "Well," looking very smug. "We just finished a jigsaw puzzle. It took us Only 51 Days . . . . . and on the box it said 4-7 years"    i copied these from another user here few days ago                                                                joking...

27cd00537a4c79f450c26015e47d2f6baa	This is interesting!  Here's my answers:     1.  If someone told me they felt comfortable around me after a week of knowing me, I'd likely be flattered, but would still be a little cautious about opening up to them.  Unless I have a super-instant connection with someone, I like to take my time getting to know someone, and will need to be certain I can trust them before I can fully open up.     2.  This is gonna sound dumb, but the more  I have a crush on somebody, the more distant I act around them.  it's so stupid, I know, but this keeps me from getting hurt if I'm not sure the feelings are mutual (yet).  But I tend to get very quiet around my crushes, and will tend to hang around him more than anyone else.  I'll also try to look at them we're they're not paying attention too.        3.  Luckily, I'm one of those Virgos who understands that flaws are just a part of human nature.  I wouldn't avoid someone completely because of their flaws, but if a person seems hypocritical, manipulative, rude, tactless, or just plain mean, I'll be civil, but will keep my contact around them to a minimum.    4.  I'm critical because I'm always on a mission to make things better.  Whether it's making my breakfast or doing tasks at work, I want to be as efficient and helpful to myself and others as possible.     5.  I love receiving compliments, but I'm terrible at accepting them.  I try to return a compliment when I can, but it's still a learning process.      6.  No - I don't want to play games or manipulate somebody just to test them (that whole "do unto others" thing).  I would hate to be seen as a hypocrite either, so I don't intentionally do stuff like that.       7.  I like silly, somewhat crass humor - stuff like Coming to America, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, etc.  It's an outlet for my emotions being so pent up all the time.     8.  This is a strange question, but yes, I would compliment someone on their effort if they gave their all.      9.  Cocky?  I only get cocky when it comes to my job -- I'm good at what I do, and so I try to be a resource to my coworkers...    10.  If I met somebody I didn't like, I would at least try to be civil with them -- it's possible that they (or I) just made a terrible first impression.  If the feeling remains that way, we'll just stay as acquaintances.  There's always something to like out of everyone, even if they can't be your friend...    11.  Hmm...If I met somebody that had a crush on me but I didn't like them, I would try to be as up front about my feelings as possible.  I wouldn't want to toy with anyone's affections or go through the motions...I don't want to waste someone else's time...    12.  I think giving your opinion without asked is rude, depending on who you're talking to.  I know how critical I can be, so I do my best not to give out my opinions unless I've been asked by my friends.  Even then, I have to phrase it so it doesn't come off as abrasive or rude.|`|YGwvoUPTaa	I consider myself a stereotypical Virgo even though I don't believe astrology is really true.    But anyhow, to amuse you...    I am very analytical. I think everything to death because I am OCD and feel like I need to be prepared for every possible outcome. I am very open minded but because I usually have everything thought out three steps in advance, I might worry if you were so forward and trusting in me so soon. I might think that you are needy and I will wonder if you have been unsuccessful in previous relationships. I definitely would want 100% trust in a relationship and I would secretly hope for that the whole time, but to hear it right away is a bit much.    My personality is very laid back, confident, and one of the guys. I am very easygoing and I think many people feel safe with me for that reason and often a lot of guys get mixed signals that I may be interested in more than friendship with them. If I am interested in a guy, I will try to flirt with them but since I still prefer to be modest as well as not too easy, I don't think guys really get that I'm interested in them.    With regards to flaws, I feel like we are all human and if people are confident despite their shortcomings, then they're the best. I don't like people who pretend they're perfect because then they're just really insecure. Insecure means I can't trust them because they're not honest with themselves or others.    I like compliments from people who aren't trying to impress me.    I think all women like to test men to see how they react =)    I really like witty sarcasm as well as randomness, especially randomness that shows eccentricty by making obscure references.    I would compliment by saying things that are true, such as regarding the effort or the learning experience, but I wouldn't lie by saying something is better than it is. I am just honest like that and I'm not trying to be mean. Sometimes a fake compliment can be insulting and I don't want to be patronizing someone.    If I didn't like someone, I would probably avoid them if I could. I don't like having more friends than I need to have. I am contradictory because I am very friendly and social but I actually befriend very few people. I just don't like being surrounded by people I don't like.    Like most women, we know right away if someone is a possible relationship match. It has nothing to do with whether or not we are actually attracted to them.     Hope this helps.|`|9dd7224885319cb49ef6caed28427c6aaa	I would feel honored and good about myself that someone would want to confide in me. And I would go to extra lengths to help them out because I'd feel as though they're relying on me somewhat, and I want to help them. They're looking up to me and I want to be the best I can be for them. If someone opened up to me about a particular issue and I thought I had a similar experience, I would explain it to them and give them my reactions, my explanations. I wouldn't go into detail about my emotions, but I'd approach it logically and tell them what I did, what I think they should do, but then remind them that I can't speak or do for them.     When I have a crush on someone, I'm probably just as friendly, but more deliberately flirtatious. If you looked closely, you can tell that I mean my actions when I stand closer to them or something like that.     Depends on what kinds of flaws. One of my friends is lazy, superficial, flighty, and is always, always late (needless to say, she's a Gemini). She's also hypocritical and I can't stand that. Those kinds of flaws aggravate me to no end and I don't like being around her for too long. I'll hang out with her occasionally, but if I'm with two other friends and they suggest calling her, I won't agree. If I also start to notice that someone is really judgmental or arrogant, I'll start to detach myself from them. I would try to tactfully point out that they're being judgmental but if they start to get defensive, I back off and move on.    I'm critical because I'm observant and analytical. I observe people and I know what kinds of topics to avoid discussing with them, why they do the things they do, why they say the things they say and why they act the way they act. I can write a very lengthy essay on an acquaintance and have it be completely accurate, and I can say so because whereas someone else might meet someone and learn 5 things about them in 20 minutes, I'll learn 50 things. I can also be critical because I get upset when people don't do things right and I have to watch them screw it up.    Compliments are nice, but they don't really do that much for me. Actions speak louder than words, always.    No, I hate hypocrisy and I make sure I don't do it myself. I might say things or ask questions to get a certain answer or bring up a certain topic I want to talk about, but never do and say two different things.    Any kind. Just not like crazy, goofy, off-the wall humor.    Yes, but it would pain me. I would say thanks and I wouldn't necessarily compliment them, I would say something like "You got this part right, but you needed to do this this way" and then I'd probably just take over myself.    I'm not cocky, I just know that I can do certain things better than many people. I know my faults and I know my strenghts as well as I know my weaknesses.    Hmm, I would probably stay away from them only because their presence would annoy me.    I would reject them. I'm not one to string along someone else or wait and see if I'll develop feelings for them. Plus, I'd get annoyed talking to them all the time when I might want to talk to someone else that I have a crush on.    Yes.|`|3WItFAwlaa	Virgo females. Will you please answer these questions?    ok    *If somebody you knew for say about a week, told you that they felt comfortable around you,and that you were easy to talk to, and they wanted to open up to you, how would you feel about this? And would you let this person open up to you?    I would they were a bit odd for talking about opening up rather than just doing it.      *What do you do if you have a crush on somebody? And how do you act around them? And how do you act toward them?    Depends who they are and whether or not the crush is appropriate.      *If you met somebody with alot of flaws, would you avoid them, Or would you help them to be a better person?    It depends on the flaws.  If they has a drug problem or mommy issues, I would avoid them.  Alot of small flaws would be ok.  I wouldn't help them to be a better person.  That is entirely up to them.    *Why are you so critical, and what makes you that way?    I just see all the flaws especially in myself.    *Do you dislike compliments? And if so, would you try to learn how to take them?    I like honest compliments.      *Do you say one thing and do another, just to see what somebody would do? If so, do you think that this is rational?    No.  I don't play games.      *what kind of humor do you like?     Any kind except the extremely stupid Something About Mary type of humor.    *Would you compliment somebody on thier effort, even if the end result was terible, but you knew that they needed it?    Yeah.... unless they were very needy.  Then I would get the heck away from them.  I am self-sufficient and expect others to be too.      *What makes you so cocky?    For me, alot of Leo in my chart.  Plus I know myself pretty well.  Young Virgos (under 30) have to really work on being confident.  The effort eventually pays off.      *If you met somebody that you didn't like, would you at least try to find a way around it, and try to make friends with them? Or would you give up on them, and avoid them at all costs?    Avoid at all costs.  I don't let just anyone into my life.  I go for quality rather than quantity.    *If you met somebody that had a crush on you, but you didn't like them, would you at least give them a chance, or would you reject them?    If I don't like them, I don't like them.  If I didn't like them, I'm sure I would have my reasons.  Whether or not they liked me would be mostly irrelevent.    *Being honest and being rude are usually mixed up with you female virgos. giving your opinion when it is not asked for is rude. giving your opinion when it is, is being honest. Do you agree with this?    Wow!  You really went in another direction with that one.  Again, it depends on the situation.      It sounds like you are interested in a Virgo who isn't interested in you.  You can't make anyone like you if they just don't regardless of their sign.
a860e9b17c0946e66c4ca331bb01f9d2aa	Absolutely not! I'm girl and I think Jessica's body is hot! Would guys rather look at her or say, Paris Hilton?    I think she's beautiful and while she has gained weight, I don't think it's fair to call her fat. What is fat? Going from a size 4 to a size 8? No.|`|whE5OQ26aa	She needs to head back to the weight room.|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	She is average weight, even less than average weight. People compare her to other rail thin celebrities who are size 0 or 00, so of course she will look bigger by comparison. But fat, no way.|`|9Ev7PdZGaa	NOOOOO!  she is a beautiful woman.    i just saw a recent pic of her. she gained like 5 pounds, so what! people need to see jessica for who she is, not some hollywood pressure  s  h  i  t.    its all in their programmed little heads.|`|fclbfy5Naa	the last time i saw her she wasn't fat at all, did she gain weight all of a sudden??    but like 1 yr ago, she wasn't =)|`|sEpBQjQjaa	I'm not sure. I didn't even know Jessica Simpson gained any weight until coming here to Yahoo Answers. Questions about her weight gain are all over and all I have to say about it is,"who gives a sh*t." If she gains weight, she gains weight...if she loses weight, she loses weight. It is nobody's business but her own. I doubt she signed any 'Must be perfect or else..." contract.   What's up with the media anyway? Are they discriminating against bigger people? Yeah, it's unhealthy to be overweight, but they don't have to make them feel ashamed about it. Nobody is perfect because we're all only human.|`|Yzyo1QcGaa	She gained a few pounds but she looks fine! I'm not her biggest fan but she has a great body but I think that her outfit was the thing that mad her look fat!!|`|DDmFQU7raa	No. If you're referring to those pictures of her in her waist-high jeans, I thought she looked great. The media pokes at stars when they gain 10 pounds!    Personally, I like a lil' meat on my women!|`|jd14u32qaa	Not fat, but definitely bigger than she was.  And when you are famous in large part for your looks, it's completely fair to be criticized for gaining weight.

dLt5mVHRaa	In Order Of Stupidity...   In case you needed further proof that the human race is doomed through stupidity, here are some actual label instructions on consumer goods.     On a Sears hairdryer -- Do not use while sleeping. (Darn, and that's the only time I have to work on my hair).     On a bag of Fritos -- You could be a winner! No purchase necessary. Details inside. (the shoplifter special)?     On a bar of Dial soap -- "Directions: Use like regular soap." (and that would be how???.....)     On some Swanson frozen dinners -- "Serving suggestion: Defrost." (but, it's "just" a suggestion).     On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom) -- "Do not turn upside down." (well...duh, a bit late, huh)!     On Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding - "Product will be hot after heating." (...and you thought????....)     On packaging for a Rowenta iron -- "Do not iron clothes on body." (but wouldn't this save me more time)?     On Boot's Children Cough Medicine -- "Do not drive a car or operate machinery after taking this medication." (We could do a lot to reduce the rate of construction accidents if we could just get those 5-year-olds with head-colds off those forklifts.)     On Nytol Sleep Aid -- "Warning: May cause drowsiness..." (and...I'm taking this because???....)     On most brands of Christmas lights -- "For indoor or outdoor use only." (as opposed to...what)?     On a Japanese food processor -- "Not to be used for the other use." (now, somebody out there, help me on this. I'm a bit curious.)     On Sainsbury's peanuts -- "Warning: contains nuts." (talk about a news flash)     On an American Airlines packet of nuts -- "Instructions: Open packet, eat nuts." (Step 3: maybe, uh...fly Delta?)     On a child's Superman costume -- "Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly." (I don't blame the company. I blame the parents for this one.)     On a Swedish chainsaw -- "Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or genitals." (Oh my God...was there a lot of this happening somewhere?)|`|ymK1hg2Raa	there's a mommy mole, a daddy mole, and a baby mole.    the daddy mole stuck his head out of the hole and said, "mmm it smells like spring out here."    the mommy mole stuck her head out and said, "yeah it does smell like spring."    there's no room for the baby mole to stick his head out, so he says "all i smell down here is molasses."    mole asses!!!!!!!!!!!!    hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha... so funny!|`|rNsi2zKjaa	kudos to jojo|`|AA10300538	Blonde Joke:    So this blonde chick gets a call that her mother has died just as she was preparing to go to work. She cries and cries, then decides to go to work anyway- she needs the distraction. She gets to work, but cant control herself. Her boss comes to find out whats wrong. She tells him her mother just died...and he suggests her taking a day off....but she adamantly says she wants to be kept busy and that she'll control the tears.  The boss walks by her desk a few hours later, and this time the blonde is bawling, like weeping her eyes out even harder. The boss asks what happened to make her even worse...blonde replies, "my twin sister just called me....she said her mother just died too..!!!!!!!!!!"  lmao    Blonde Joke:  So a blonde goes to a tech store to buy a tv. She asks the sales rep how much the tv is. He says, "im sorry, we dont sell to blondes".  Confused and a little pissed, she stomps off....  The next day, she dyes her hair red and goes back to the shop. "How much is that tv?" Rep :im sorry, we dont sell to blondes"...  Frustrated and wondering how he knew...she goes home and decides to dye her hair brunette. She goes back to the store the following day. "How much is that tv?" Rep: im sorry, we do not sell to blondes".  This time, she is so curious, she asks, "well, how do u know that im blonde??"  The rep says, "well, thats not a tv, its a microwave!"  hahahaha    Kudo's to Jojo...her jokes were freaking hilarious!!!!!|`|uYuaCyKaaa	One day a college professor of psychology was greeting his new college class. He stood up in the front of the class and said "Would anyone who thinks he or she is stupid, please stand up?" After a minute or so of silence, a young man stood up.   "Well, hello there sir. So you actually think you're a moron?" The professor asked.  The kid replied, "No sir, I just didn't want to see you standing there all by yourself"                  Lol "product will be hot after heating" that's just awesome|`|ZYcgmb83aa	A lady walks into a Lexus dealership. She browses around, then spots   the perfect car and walks over to inspect it. As she bends to feel the   fine leather upholstery, a loud fart escapes her.

As she turns back, there standing next to her, is a salesman. "Good   day, Madame. How may we help you today?"   Very uncomfortably she asks, "Sir, what is the price of this lovely   vehicle?"   He answers, "Madame, if you farted just touching it, you are going to   **** when you hear the price."|`|d1c98d5f53bffe45427bed1d7f9cedb5aa	yer face

AA11122483	They should understand it. I understood the movie perfectly and i dont understand any hindi at all. Theres subtitles when they speak in hindi or the other languages. Most of it is in English so i understood it. The only problem is if your friends have never heard the Indian accent before it may be hard to understand their English when some characters speak. Buts its not that bad. And theres like some people and well known stuff in Indian culture that I didnt know, but the movie explains it. So its all good. The only one thing that it didnt explain was like the Muslim/Hindi hatred thing, but I figured it out from stuff in history class. But youll see why; i dont wanna ruin the movie for you. They should watch it! Its a spectactular movie. Im from a totally different culture so it really opened my eyes!|`|Fn2PdDzfaa	There's nothing that they wont understand. The movie starts with the young Jamaal and Salim, and most of the cast speaking Hindi, but the subtitles are there alright!!   After about 45 mins the movie goes on in English, with a lil bit of Hindi here and there but, no worries, your friends will do fine with the translations!!  (Personally, i myself am not familiar with hindi :P)  Hope you enjoy the movie!!|`|fPR7uXXLaa	yea it's in english, some parts aren't but will have subs, it is an english speaking film, how else is it being nominated for best picture|`|DbjqJ1hoaa	Slumdog Millionaire (2008)    Slumdog Millionaire - http://purchasemovies.net/2009/01/27/slu...|`|GNtWomekaa	Some of the movie is in English.

Your friend is quite funny.   Marilyn Monroe will ALWAYS be known. She's been gone for how long and people all over still admire her. No one can even come close when being compared with her. She's unique...and Miley, not so much. I don't care if I get a 'thumbs down' for this, but I don't care. Marilyn Monroe is prettier than Miley hands down. What was up with Miley's mouth in that one video anyway when she was "OooOOooO-ing" (7 things blah blah). Not very attractive.|`|uHBa1f8aaa	Miley Cyrus  shes a michael jackson fan|`|odj23SKzaa	How can someone even dare to compare that Miley person with the great works of Marilyn Monroe?

Playing on an acoustic will help as well because you have to push harder on the strings than an electric. Instead of stress balls try going to a sporting goods store and go to the boxing section. There they have these hand and wrist exercisers, not more than $10-$15 total together that  give out more resistance than stress balls.|`|llNoDDCsaa	Get one of those things where you can press with individual fingers.|`|Ot06v8yvaa	they just strength your finger resistance.|`|AA10033367	Nope.  You know what improves your guitar playing?    Practice.  Practice.  Practice.  There is no substitute.      If you are trying to increase your finger strength try playing on a steel string acoustic guitar.  After a couple of weeks going back to an electric will feel really easy.

There were plenty of interesting articles. I wouldn't choose them being a 22-year-old male, but I actually found some things to be readable. I would get it if I were a teenage girl.

But I like the topics she has on her talk show.. (Extremely embarrassed)  I really cannot stand much of HER, but I think most of the topics she has are interesting.    So sometimes I watch her, but I don't like her.  She's obnoxious, and is always frontin'  ehk, Idk I just don't like her|`|MxxNjf9Zaa	I used to watch ANTM but not anymore.  I don't like her because of the way she acts and how she is so out there and provocative. I sometimes think what she does is uncalled for and i don't respect her in some areas by the way she presents herself.  And yet i do like her because she does seem carrying and understanding sometimes. You can tell she does care for those and she isn't all fake or about acting in a whorish way.

bRoFUcIgaa	I'm shocked that it's even become such "big" news, I don't think she's fat and with all of the fat jokes going around- it seems that some individuals are having a moment of severely low self esteem. I'd like to see *HALF* of what those making fun of her look like themselves, you know what I mean?  Anyways, she's beautiful and just because she isn't a double zero- she's automatically large which isn't the case at all. In my opinion, she looks better then super skinny size zero celebs, she's healthy. The fact that she's being made fun of and what not just shows why so many young girls aren't confident with themselves and why so many go to drastic measures to lose weight.  The media is portraying an image which should be sought after that isn't exactly easy to obtain. I think it's ridiculous! Team Jess for sure =)|`|e7TfRANbaa	i honestly can't believe this is what everyone is talking about now. it shouldn't matter to us whether someone likes their  body skinny, full, healthy, masculine, etc. point is, it's theirs. period. it's probably extra hard on someone like jessica because she has always been seen as a "sex symbol". i kinda find it funny though, how it's always women getting blasted about their weight.|`|X1zLokEAaa	THE ***** IS HUUUUUUUUUUGGGGEEEE!|`|mZUXkeyRaa	Yeah, i agree.  People need to stop bashing her  She gained weight, big deal  Atleast she isn't anorexic looking!  She looks great|`|whE5OQ26aa	She's not going to be famous if she's fat. She needs to head to a gym and start using the weights. Either that or get on a treadmill or bike.|`|e4LDIQJJaa	i'm not really that big of a fan of hers at all.     but yes i agree too. She just needs to find outfits that flatter her new look. I didn't like that tanktop and jeans combo she had on. it made her look kinda frumpy but not fat. she's got curves and that's great.     super skinny girls are just horrible.|`|eI5rgLcraa	fat    but so what    shell shed the pounds and we'll all be happy 4 her    hope she gets fat on and off like oprah|`|mcehFtY0aa	I love it!! WHy should she starve herself? If she is ahhpy with it, whose business is it but hers?|`|fb2d92b771dcd4d8b2d1dc3da6af3e05aa	i havent really paid any attention to her, but those pics that are causing all the commotion, i think the outfit for one was an unfortunate choice.  Even the camera angle was bad, i think the photographers had a grudge against her.  By no means is she ugly or obese, but you know how the tabloids are about celebrities.

26ygzBVkaa	they aren't sure yet because of inappropriate contact and if they do they should make it as a Rated R movie. And *SPOILER* what about Renesmee? Shes constantly growing in the book. I think they should make it into a movie. And it would be a pretty longgg movie. The book is like 850 something pages long. But when I think about it Lord of the Rings is like four hours long. anyways they should make it into a movie.|`|W1lh6A8saa	Well...they sure as hell aren't making it yet. No, I don't believe they would ever make a twilight movie be rated "R" that would completely ruin the chance of the movie's main fan base (tweens- teens) going to see it. I don't even think they have started filming New Moon yet. It'll be a while.|`|zlHgIltOaa	WHO CARES??    Plz tell me that people have gotten over Twilight already.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	The film will not be "R", as they would lose large portions of the   audience    ALL four books are to be done|`|07k8lC17aa	Yes they are! It'll be in a few years time though. Becaue New Moon hasn't even came out! =D  I'm not sure about the Roted R bit. But was Twilight Rated R? If it was then it probaly will be! =]|`|AA12270666	they aren't sure yet.    just give it acouple of years  there are a lot of factors like picking the right actors and actresses for all the parts, rob and kristen have only signed up to eclipse, and  also they probably won't make breaking dawn if new moon and eclipse don't do well.    it takes about a t least a year to do each movie so expect new moon like 2009/2010, then eclipse 2010/2011   and breaking dawn should come out 2011/2012 thast a long time. and i  mean isnt the world supposed to end in 2012?  haha.    well yeah theres no for sure answer  but stepheniemeeyer has said that if they do it will be very difficult, and i agree.       oh and it wouldn't be rated r because their main fan base ( young teens) wouldn't be able to get into the movie, and they would make less money. so that would be a stupid move on their part...
0RvZ7IkMaa	this sounds mushy- but write what you feel!  i just answered one of your questions about the girl you liked from work.. write about her! the way you feel when you see her, what you wish would between you two. i mean if those are the kind of lyrics you want t owrite. maybe listen to your favorite bands or groups or singers or whatever and get inspiration. think about the way she smiles or laughs or looks at you when she'll freak out about something, yah know? lmao reach within yourself! ..totally kidding|`|BNYBKbNoaa	sing songs you know.  you don't always have to write your own lyrics.  but if you really want to,  try thinking of something that inspires you.|`|6uogGZZVaa	You don't always have to write your own lyrics if your not into singing songs on the radio or produced songs. There are tons of people, myself included, that cannot sing, but have a great(or so i'd like to think) skill at writing lyrics. It is possible to contact these people through sites like, http://www.allthelyrics.com/forum/ and the like. Also you can possibly find people that are willing to 'lend' you their lyrics to sing, but you have to respect the writer's rights there.    If your interested, send me an email and i can show you some of mine.

DUg1IkTIaa	Yes, I sure am.  In my area, there are going to re-run the second episode.  It had captions at the bottom to aid the viewers, but with the Winter Storm Warnings streaming across the bottom, I couldn't read some of them.    I think the island keeps shifting in time/space because Ben & John moved the island while so many of the Survivors were off the island.  That's why Ben and Jack are trying to get the Oceanic Six back onto the island.  It should stop the temporal displacements.|`|ibiO4VEQaa	Apparently we also find out who sent the flaming arrows too!|`|AA11357056	Me, me... and just what exactly did Ben mean when he said that whoever moves the island can never go back... it is because they can't find it again... or another reason... or maybe he's just lying (again).|`|9d186c4d38844c8ca3dbdf7a8c956a1faa	I AMMMMMMMMMMMM LOLL I LUV LOSTTTTTT but actually i get lost sometimes kind of confused lol but i cant wait (2 minutes ago i asked the same question not knowing somebody had ask lol)

So she will not be in any of the twilight movies.|`|nY4OFf43aa	Jane. I don't know how she will be. i hope she is good. And the new vampire movie in called New Moon.|`|tt1EMG6Yaa	Jane - the Volturi vampire who can torture people with her mind.      The next movie to come out (which dakota will most likely be in) is called New moon (and follows twilight)|`|JJ7pPXMbaa	She didn't.  She was offered a role but has yet to respond to the makers of the film.|`|lIxHtCiXaa	Jane. ome of the vampires in the volturi.|`|BPXdpHVNaa	she hasn't officially gotten the role, she was offered the role of Jane - a petite, harmless looking vampire. That can actually hurt you by using her mind (all she has to do is look at you, and it sends harmful shock waves through your body)    i think dakota fanning looks the part but, if she can play the part is a totally different question|`|dMhTCBmyaa	Jane|`|rHlmNoYUaa	Jane of the Volturi.  Vanessa Anne Hudgens tried out for Leah but thankfully didn't get it.
l0QxY4pKaa	Hey,  You have a very sound basis to begin your guitar journey. As on the piano you would have learnt the Scales. I think it is time for you to do the same on the guitar.     One of the most satisfying experiences on any musical instrument is to be able to improvise. With your knowledge of the piano and the guitar and some knowledge of scales you can move on to song arrangements and recording or playing in a band The possibilities are endless..    Try this website for more resources on learning the guitar, recording at home, playing in bands etc.    http://www.4guysformusic.com|`|mPz2r7n5aa	well ther are good rock bands like metallica they have a lot of goods slow songs you can learn and there easy too, there are also guitar books you can look into they also have good guitar music in them. but mostley rock music, but if you keep exploering them im sure you'll find great music to learn hoe to play.

WFtffz4Naa	When Scorpio and Aquarius make a love match, it is a fusion of two very different life philosophies and many very different needs. There is much chance for friction here. Where Scorpio faces their inner emotional world directly and with an intense energy, thinking deeply about the more hidden undercurrents of life, Aquarius takes that same sort of energy and turns it outward. With their unusual, idealistic and, above all else, very social outlook on life, Aquarius seems an odd choice for the more introverted Scorpio. Aquarius needs a crowd to feel stimulated, and they're always looking around the room for the next interesting person to get to know. Scorpio, on the other hand, desires engaging, probing and very intimate time with their romantic mates. This pair may seem to have very little in common, but they both have such strong wills that, when focused on their relationship, can get them what they need and want. Both Scorpio and Aquarius can be uncooperative and opinionated: They like things to go their way, no questions asked! For this love match, though, 'their ways' are very dissimilar. Scorpio is inquisitive, digging deeply into the hidden meaning of things, always asking questions and wanting to know where things are going and why. Aquarius is progressive and affable yet does not enjoy detail. Scorpio may be enticed by their differences, as Aquarius shows them new, exterior worlds but may end up frustrated trying to get answers from this eccentric enigma. Aquarius does not welcome possessiveness, either, preferring to belong to the world rather than one single person. But a stinging Scorpion can be fiercely possessive, and they require more attention than an Aquarian might be able to give. If Aquarius slows down and pays attention, they may find the devotion Scorpio provides to be a great support. The Planets Mars and Pluto rule Scorpio, and the Planets Saturn and Uranus rule Aquarius. Mars is a revolutionary, aggressive and spirited masculine energy, and Pluto enlightens these impulses and adds a rebirthing, cyclical quality. Saturn is a cool, contained energy, and Uranus is about all things different and unusual. Mars is emotional, reacting without thinking things through; such is the nature of Scorpio. Saturn demands of Aquarius much hard work and discipline, while Uranus gives them that forward thinking mind. A gentle Scorpio lover, careful not to tether an Aquarius in too tightly can teach their mate about a life based on emotional intuition, one that quiets the intellect sometimes in favor of physical sensation. Understanding Aquarians can teach their serious Scorpio mates to calm down, to detach themselves from uncontrollable situations and to reevaluate their goals if they get off course.     Scorpio is a Water Sign, and Aquarius is an Air Sign. Air is about the intellect, so Aquarius tackles life as one chance to grow and explore after another, while Scorpio is more analytical. Scorpio looks for purpose, and Aquarius seeks stimulation. These love mates have trouble understanding one another's origin of thought. Confrontations arise is Scorpio's possessiveness gets the better of them or if Aquarius seems too cool and flippant and denies Scorpio emotional reassurance. Both need to learn that they view the world in different ways and they should celebrate and laugh at their differences. Scorpio and Aquarius are both Fixed Signs. Both can be unyielding, dogmatic and persevering. If they have a plan, they'll stick to it until their efforts are rewarded. Once they have made up their minds that they are good mates for one another, they will never be discouraged from maintaining the relationship. But they may have such contradictory approaches to life that their relationship gets more difficult than it is pleasurable. If they believe in the value of the relationship, they will be able to overcome differences. What's the best thing about the Scorpio-Aquarius relationship? Their capacity for success in their synergy. Both Signs have very powerful personalities, so neither will openly dominate the other. Once they can appreciate their differences, come together and agree on their individual roles within the relationship, the results can be intensely gratifying.|`|KvyB0E77aa	An Aquarian wife is always great in bed. I know cause my wife is one.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I've heard that Scorpio and Aquarius can work really well together because Scorpio can help Aquarius express their emotions better and Aquarius can help Scorpio learn not to take things so seriously and how to let things go.|`|OzfrMg9qaa	if he is a scorp with a cap rising that means he doesnt bullshit around he means business . he knows what he wants and and he will point it out of he does not find it in you because of the sag moon . sag moon people are very outspoken.

When i first heard wayne was coming out with a rock album i was kinda routing for da lil dude. It sounded like a good idea! JayZ collaborated with Linkin park and dat shyt was DOPE. I didn't know wayne was gonna sing. I thought he was gonna rap over the rock beat like jayz did. Wayne needs to get his mothafuckin act togetha man i'm sick of the damn singin.|`|nFDc2LTaaa	I Reckon It's a piece of crap lil wayne is starting to make rock music!!!
AA10883519	I know a lot of rock fan's who assume "Blues & Jazz" to be one answer!! They couldn't be more mistaken. Jazz is jazz, and blues are blues. They couldn't pass for one another, and are distinctly different in structure and form, to a listener with any kind of stylistic ear.   I guess it just comes down to people's narrow pidgeonholing of musical sound. Anyone with a slight ear can tell the difference between the art forms,   Sometimes I wish I could show them by example, putting Contemporary Country into the same group as Adult Alternative Rock. Then I realize they just don't know any better, and take solace in he fact that I do.|`|xBiLoU8Laa	put it this way in jazz you play 3 chords to millions of people in blues you play millions of chords to 3 people|`|LIyqb5Rwaa	I think Who C might have that phrase backwards........    Jazz cats usually know and play ALL of the chords.    With blues it's 3 chords, and more importantly all the chords you're NOT playing!|`|pElG2K61aa	I guess because many of us are. My interest in blues led me into bluesy jazz, then deeper into jazz itself. Also my father was a huge fan of original early jazz and had an extensive collection of what we now call Dixieland.    I love both for different reasons despite the tensions that exist between the two genres. Having said that, I used to own a bootleg tape of Dizzy Gillespie appearing onstage with Muddy Waters. Dizzy stumbled at first and had a hard time finding his trumpet's voice but after a few songs was flowing right along.    This does NOT include that sludge known as "smooth jazz". Yuck!|`|GvmVDJ7Eaa	because there is a big influence, jazz is influenced by the blues. they both have the same instruments sometimes too.|`|2vzj65Kfaa	yes.    some people think of blues as being jazz's retarded cousin.    However, a serious blues fan knows better.

I suggest you getting there maybe half hour to an hour early. I know some people who are showing up about 3 hours early, but I don't think they'll show up to the theater you're going too, lol. <br>  -Try to wear something Jonas like. But also something that you feel comfortable and can dance in. Because there WILL be alot of screaming and dancing, just like a regular concert. So maybe a Jonas related t-shirt, some converse, and some skinny jeans.<br>  -Um, get some popcorn ! I heard that there's this one part where Big Rob goes, "Can I have some more popcorn?" or something like that.<br>  <br>  Havee funnn:)|`|v1tHjJ3haa	I would say 2 hours earlier cause most ppl tend to show up on time or an hour earlier -think ahead of what u would normally do - <br>  <br>  Maybe make ur own shirt -decorate- like I'm the only me here or something like that :D<br>  <br>  Snacks, whatever ur tastebuds LOVE to eat !|`|JReroESmaa	preorder your tickets :)|`|uqE7DNK2aa	Omg, I can't wait for the movie either.

IHUS8wsbaa	this is not true, this rumour of this album is false. 7even is a false album, I have reasearched it and its false, even the songs on youtube of 7even are false. There is more rap and barely a word from michael, also its not michael singing its another guy whom i forgot the name of but is a soundalike of michael, im sorry to dissapoint you but its false! This rumour of 7 even has been around for a while NOT TRUE. I think mike can do better than some of the songs on the false album, but some of the false songs are actually pretty good    from bad era fan    edit: i remember the name of the soundalike i think his name is Jason Malachi|`|cRhkkBAEaa	me' lil' sister's right.    It's a false one.|`|HXpOui7gaa	I hope this is true.  But bad era fan might be right.  We'll have to wait and see.

Klb4ZYcVaa	The kids, of course. But they were all great. Brilliant movie. No particular actor there, no one did better than the other, the whole movie, the plot, screenplay, direction, the music was amazing & they deserved every single Oscar they won.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	It looks like a stupid movie in my opinion|`|yqe0I5zpaa	Frieda Pinto, her performance was very real. It was easily the best of the movie, when she was supposed to look hopeless and sad, she did. When she looked happy and romantic, she was beautiful. She easily gave the best performance of the film.|`|akcGfgdcaa	Hard to choose as most of the performances were quite poor. I did enjoy the film though, the direction, music and story were great.|`|plmSIqNaaa	I'm a big fan of Dev Patel, and also the children who played the younger versions of him and Freida Pinto's character.
kNnqjlWiaa	yeah it annoys the sh*t out of me|`|aiKCxCyWaa	yea!!! i was watching a movie with my friend as she just kept talking and talking and i tried to block her out and i kept telling her "SHUT UP!!!" but she'd be like "dont tell me to shut up! im tryna tell a story! gosh!" and then she says "wait, wait!!! whats going on!! who is this person!!" and then i have to like half of the movie! and my mom is always on her laptop and says "oh, im getting off" but in ten minutes, shes off and she's lost so we have to rewind and start all over.|`|uSNn3iJDaa	Or how about you and the other person is watching the movie for the first time and they are asking you questions as if you've seen it before.  Just shut up and watch the movie like I am!!! ugh!! lol|`|6etaFOnhaa	haha yeah<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225150608AAvO3RS&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|bUWWeT0Xaa	I don't always pay the most attention.  I can fall asleep during a movie that I really love if I get to comfy.|`|H1YQ14Haaa	Idk... But I hate this too.<br>  My mom does it ALL the time.|`|7wGwdwH4aa	hell yea and i never do say what happened in the movie too bad!!|`|FNwxcBPpaa	It really doesn't bother me. I just ignore them.|`|wT9KXIC0aa	Yes, I hate that.|`|zdMlBTATaa	yes..and when iv seen the film and know its really good and want them to watch it lol like my parents the other day with "7 pounds" i had to force them to stay awake! it pis*ed me off so much..my mum started nodding off at the best bit!|`|qvdZIMlwaa	wow i know. but it's worse when THEY want 2 watch the movie then THEY don't watch it. and they want 2 do something lese with u but u r rlly into the movie and they get all mad at u. it's like wtf??|`|EIzs2OWeaa	AHAHAHA i know eggzactly what you mean :]<br>  Now best answer plz i starred your question!|`|D315ChzHaa	yes
IYF4xSTdaa	the worst is the falling asleep part...lol..I see it happens a lot,and not only to me..|`|8d45e8ed94934268a1b2d20d368177d3aa	yes I hate that and they keep asking questions and trying to start conversations  i'm like please shut up.|`|lJcbQ00Haa	Ugh no kidding. The only thing worse than that is when someone in a movie theatre insists on checking their cell phone every 5 minutes, because a glowing light in a dark room isn't noticeable/annoying, and clearly they paid $10 just to text message in a nice chair and irritate other people. What happened to movie etiquette?

ACLIVzy7aa	Edie's husband appears to have finally lost it and was seeing the ghosts of his dead wife and child who appartently died in the beginning of series five when they were knocked down by Susan and Mike's car. The thing i don't get is at the end of today's episode Edie's husband says Mike Delfino has to pay, but SUSAN was driving the car, not Mike. So it's possible there's a twist and it's nothing to do with that crash and instead it's got some thing to do with what Mike went to prison for or something else from his past.|`|c1de8b0505a79fcad4bedc3b6eac4556aa	he was talking to his wife and son who were killed in a car accident at the beginning of s5 caused by Mike and Susan. He is mentally unstable and is seeing their ghosts|`|SUvSJRwoaa	His dead wife and daughter- they were killed in the car crash caused by Mike and Susan. Hence the whole deranged/revenge thing.|`|L5tWiYOFaa	He was pleading with Paul Daniels to 'finish what he started'...|`|9ZRvPegvaa	I am so happy it is back!! Yes, like someone said- on a previous series when Susan & Mike had the accident it seems the mother and daugher who died were the psycho's family.  It seems he will be after little MJ awwwww! I am still loving it, not fizzled out yet.

bBiuvBTvaa	This song is about the woman who deflowered Stewart when he was 16. In the January, 2007 issue of Q magazine, Stewart said: "Maggie May was more or less a true story, about the first woman I had sex with, at the Beaulieu Jazz Festival. It nearly got left off because the label said it didn't have a melody. I said, 'Well, we've run out of time now, these are all the tracks we've recorded. They said, Alright, then, bring it on."|`|chPWEqWQaa	it was about an affair he had with an older woman.
fjNxzd6Baa	Paula. I expect a judge to make and state a judgment; not do her best to not hurt anyone's feelings.|`|QmSIsUZvaa	i hate both paula and kara because kara just agrees with randy and paula is a stupid pushover who embarasses herself every show. i wud vote paula off because her fights with simon make me uncomfortable and at least kara has a good opinion because randy usually does.|`|7lZnHiYZaa	Paula Rehabdul (ha.)|`|OAWCNff5aa	Kara|`|IxD8aNHTaa	The new one for sure. They should have kept it the way it was.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	Paula needs to go.  I always fast forward in DVR mode when she speaks.  She is retarded.  Cara is pretty annoying too but less annoying.  Her facial expressions make me want to kick the TV though.|`|mLXhUwUmaa	kara shes just another paula what was the point off getting her simons mean but he makes the show entertaining|`|39wcLSoPaa	Paula :/|`|MCHIPQa0aa	paula|`|Q51be8Opaa	paula|`|4Y1qzeBfaa	The new girl...|`|r8ST3cFIaa	That Kara girl annoys me so much. I'd vote her off.|`|4hnMSeotaa	The new one...... what's her name..... see, she's so boring I don't remember her.............|`|DqdA3njaaa	I would get rid of Paula in a flash. She is too much of a pushover and she'll say yes to anyone with a touching story, or usually if they beg because "it's their dream". I know Kara is new but I can already tell that she has an opinion and doesn't use Paula's judgement at all.|`|kLGGbjNVaa	kara|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	the new chick
cw2KARcPaa	You totally missed the first two episodes of the season, well, actually the first three if you count tonight's episode (I am not counting the recap episode that aired last week).    Check abc.com/lost and they should have the new episodes online to watch... with any luck you can catch up by next week!|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	You missed it, but they are having a rerun before the new episode.|`|XVPLO3xyaa	How could you forget the premiere of LOST?

EPPb5pRBaa	I agree, There is some crazy stuff on Y&R..|`|uUzbqGh5aa	I'm happy Gloria's free, l wait to see if she will go back to being Gloria the bad or if she will change her life and stop the scheming! I don't know why she wants back Jeff, maybe she's just playing her usual games with him. <br>  Sharon's s/l is puzzling and l'm just about tired of it.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	No.  Gloria has always been this way, esp with Jeff.  Esther wouldn't sell that house for all the tea in china.  Now Sharon--maybe she's having a breakdown.<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|FwU6GL4Laa	I would just about bet that Gloria has something up her sleeve, I don't think she would forgive Jeffery that quick, he really betrayed her. Im hoping Ester will wake up and see what Roger is doing before he drains her dry but probably what will happen is he will get her money then Mrs. C. will be completely back and hopefully he wont be able to keep the money since shes alive and he will be found out and hopefully put under the jail...Sharon seems to play the victim yesterday she was telling Jack she don't deserve him..I cant believe she left him for lying and being secretive and now look she's slept with Nick and Billy and her and Jack isn't divorced yet. I think everything will hit her at once and she will have a huge breakdown.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	I can't believe she would want him back after what he did to her...she ahould go through the divorce and enjoy the money Victor gave her.  As for Sharon.....I feel really bad for her.  She had slept with a man she has loved half her life and he decides that he is going to drop her like a sack of beans.  And she gave up somebody that she truly cares about...if she would have told him she loved him and he would have stayed he may not have died...but Noah might have.  She is prob. in a whirl wind of emotions she prob doesn't know what to do with herself.|`|SXwlw9N2aa	Gloria has always been pretty wacky and even more so when she hooked up with Jeff. This whole stupid storyline with Esther marrying Roger is about on my last nerve. I cant believe that the writers are making Esther be so dumb and had her marry him after only a few weeks of knowing him. I have read some spoilers that say Sharon is going to have a breakdown, but she has no one else to blame but herself for that. She wanted Brad when he was married to someone else and she was married, then when Brad was free, she didn't want him she wanted Jack. Then when she leaves Jack and the both of them are free she tells Brad she doesn't want to be with him. She then sleeps with Nick and now Nick doesn't want her. She wants what she cant have. She needs to get a life, if she really wants and thinks she needs a man in her life she should go back to Jack. But she doesn't want him now, but I bet when they bring this new woman on the show that is might be a new love interest for Jack, Sharon will want him back.|`|cce7d68825e6be23ab1dbad4e0df262faa	Of course Michael got her off he's the best and Gloria is such an idiot for wanting Jeffrey back yuck Esther is always been so dam stupid sweet kind but stupid and Sharon is really loosing it big time!

48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	I believe it's 1990 and it's the The Wall: Live in Berlin DVD.    It was a huge multi-guest-star concert lead by Roger Waters at the Potsdam Plaza in Berlin. The concert was held after the Berlin Wall came down.    The part right before this is this intense, shouted poetry by Bryan Adams and Roger Waters together, and that, leading into this song is one of my favorite parts.    The DVD is FABULOUS.   (So is the CD ;-) My favorite 'version' of The Wall.    I believe it's Snowy White on lead guitar... interesting "comments" under this video:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=invo5D6Su...|`|iIWWeD7Taa	1990 The Wall Berlin.

The manga did cut the fight between Yuusuke and Yomi short because Togashi (the mangaka) had a little argument with his editor about the direction of his series. The company wanted him to keep Yuyu Hakusho continue longer, but Togashi didn't want his series became another cash cows product like Dragon Ball. So, he rushed to end his series and start working on his next project, Hunter x Hunter (which is an awesome series btw) after taking a long vacation.<br>  <br>  If you read Chapter 171 - After the Party, Yuusuke explained things that happens in a fight between him and Yomi and who became the next King of the Demon World to Kuwabara and Kurama. However, if you really wanted to skipped reading all that unrelated stuff, you can skipped to the last chapter, Chapter 175 where all the characters (except Hiei of course) gathered on Genkai's funeral.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://manga.animea.net/yu-yu-hakusho-chapter-175-page-4.html#i" rel="nofollow">http://manga.animea.net/yu-yu-hakusho-ch...</a><br>  <br>  I won't recommend skipping all that stuff though. You will be wondering about the last talk the group of Kuwabara, Keiko, Yukina, Botan and Shizuru have about Yuusuke claiming "Keiko is my angel / goddess" if you skip the chapter in between 170-175. <br>  <br>  Its a fun reading after all. Seeing Hiei last word is "Happy Birthday!", seeing Yuusuke wearing a school girl uniform, seeing the fate of Game Master, Doctor, and Sniper from Sensui arc.

9kHN3ar0aa	It originated in Jamaica in the 1950s. It has elements of Caribbean mento and American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the offbeat. To me, a lot of songs also have the noticeable trumpet part. I guess there are a lot of different theories about the origins of the word ska. Ernest Ranglin said that the term came from musicians that to refer it to the "skat! skat! skat!" scratching guitar strum. Another theory I heard is that it derives from the word skavoovie. Also, Jackie Mittoo insisted that the musicians themselves called the rhythm Staya Staya, and that it was Byron Lee who introduced the term 'ska'. So, I guess I don't know what to believe lol. But I love ska! I saw Reel Big Fish and Streetlight Manifesto in concert only a few weeks ago :D|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Ska evolved in the early '60s, when Jamaicans tried to replicate the sound of the New Orleans R&B they heard over their radios. Instead of mimicking the sound of the R&B, the first ska artists developed a distinctive rhythmic and melodic sensibility, which eventually turned into reggae music.     There are different theories about the origins of the word ska. Ernest Ranglin claimed that the term was coined by musicians to refer to the "skat! skat! skat!" scratching guitar strum. Another explanation is that at a recording session in 1959 produced by Coxsone Dodd, double bassist Cluett Johnson instructed guitarist Ranglin to "play like ska, ska, ska", although Ranglin has denied this, stating "Clue couldn't tell me what to play!". A further theory is that it derives from Johnson's word skavoovie, with which he was known to greet his friends. Jackie Mittoo insisted that the musicians themselves called the rhythm Staya Staya, and that it was Byron Lee who introduced the term 'ska'|`|rgovWVP4aa	ska is a break away from reggae , and a mixture with skittles music . lonny donnigan was a skittle player , skittles music is whit an old washboard and a scrapper that when run up and down gives a croaky sound which can be heard amongst ska, and the Ruth is the same|`|wbcmHJ3waa	ska is a racist grup in germany and they sing bout whites only world|`|ccEWxExfaa	Ska is a form of reggae.|`|rkufaNiPaa	it came form jamaca and it means is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was a precursor to rocksteady and reggae|`|8vAxlg2Daa	Ska is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s, and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae.It went through severall changes Suck as Two Tone, and the third wave, Ska still has instrumental influences and heavy rythms.

8cDd70dSaa	Each string on a guitar is a different note. Playing different notes at the same time produces a chord, just like playing 3 different clarinet notes at the same time produces a chord. Theoretically, you could pick the melody out from the chords, but since guitar chords are spread out over several beats, you would just end up with a bunch of half notes and whole notes. What you need is a melody. See if you can find sheet music to find the melody of the song, or if it's a song on the radio, try transcribing it (listening to the melody and figuring it out by ear).
5gTWIH6Caa	Dude, keep the Ibanez. It's a way better guitar than the Strat, especially the newer Fenders.

The script by Jonathan and Christopher Nolan was flawless, the dialogue, everything in the script was great. Heath Ledger's performance will go down as one of the most iconic and stunning performances of all-time. Christian Bale makes for the best Bruce Wayne ever, he is supposed to act like a D Bag for cover and he does that very well, when he looks bleak, he looks bleak. The best Batman ever. The film is great, the action sequences are breath taking. The truck flip, the interrogation scene was amazing, which BTW was ALL in the script. Great film, it's too bad Ledger passed on, i'm sure The Joker would have been in a sequel.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Best Batman Movie Ever.|`|6kWsM5LEaa	are you kidding me?! that movie was amazing..<br>  christian bale wasnt thattt great but heath ledger was absolutely AMAZING.

It is an embarrassment to all Indians. They western pose themselves as culturally advanced.  Do they really? <br>  <br>  Only because the producer and director are not Indians, this film won so many Oscars.  I have a doubt A.R.Rahman was selected because he was already selected in “Golden Globe”. In fact, A.R.Rahman to his credit already at least over hundred song superior in his two decade career. <br>  <br>  They will humiliate Indians to the maximum extent possible, but they invest more in Indian Territory as FDI to siphon out Indian economy. <br>  <br>  I heard once that during 1897, the Taj Mahal Hotel in Gate Way of India Mumbai, the one attacked on 26/11, was built by Tatas while Tata was refused entry in the then star hotel saying Indian Dogs are not allowed.<br>  <br>  the cultural advancement yet to happen in them.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Jamal (Dev Patel) is from the UK, an Indian decendant. & he wan't nominated for Best Actor, he wasn't even trying.

Boyle was capturing the truth.|`|pbTtq0l5aa	First of all chill ! Itz a movie ! Just a movie... an art, fiction - not reality !!!<br>  <br>  I am an Indian living in the US. And from what I know that movie doesn't change the preception people have about India. I think it is us Indians who take all these movies soo seriously and get offended by them. Like it suprised me to know that billu barber had to be changed to billu because barbers association was upset.... it bothered to know that many people would go against jodha akbar because it had some incorrect history ! really ??? Is that necessary ! Why take everything soo seriously ! Here in the US  Indians always get along with each other no matter what religion they are in ! I think that living experience that we provide here is a better... MUCH better proof for the western world on our unity more than a movie ! I think they take the movie the way they are supposed to.... they watched it to see a good story unfold in front of them. Even if that story had happened in mexico or china... they could careless ! I<br>  <br>  The movie showed a culture of slum, I am sure it is over exaggerated to an extend ! But not as much as Bollywood movies though ! Like couple months ago I watched singh is kingh and I was laughing soo hard because someone's blood was boiling ! We add more stupidity to our movies  !!!<br>  <br>  I guess being a patriotic Indian u r upset, but let me ask u, if that movie had been shot in pakistan slums would have had a the same view on it ???? Or would have enjoyed it ? This movie could have happened any where else but the story was based on a book that and Indian author wrote..... ! Take patriotism and personal reasons away when u judge art and talents ! There are places to show patriotism but that shouldn't let us from appreciating things that other have to offer.... ! <br>  <br>  <br>  I for some reason think that, though the movie even in its innaccurate details on some things and over exaggerations, provided a good message on the spirit of Indians. It shows that Indians despite what conditions they are from has the passion to succeed, the determination to follow their desires. It shows that the talent and beauty even in our slums. The movie was not intended to show the down fault of India. I think most ppl are civilized and educated enough to realize that India has been a country noted for its economic growth !!! <br>  <br>  Again its a movie ! It doesn't change what India really is and even if it does change the preception that others have on us, heeyyyyyy we will prove that they are wrong through our economy, strength !!! sooo chillaxx !!|`|UxlL89rHaa	Please, most Asians are stuck up and look down on the poor and unfortunate.|`|WyPDngtWaa	hi,first of all  this is not the first movie that captured abt india.even salaam bombay,mother india too showed the poverty of india.<br>  only difference was the above 2 were directed by indian directors unlike a western director.<br>  yes as u have mentioned there is a fault in the movie as the hero speaks in accent.thats not good.<br>  overall i felt happy that A R RAHMAN,GULZAR,RESUL POOKUTY won an oscar for the film!!!|`|pTx9Hsavaa	boris above says only dev was ethnic indian all other cast were western its not true.<br>  <br>  most of the cast were hindi film actors,like anil kapoor ,saurabh shukla,irfan khan.all the child stars are from mumbai,2 from dharavi slums.<br>  <br>  no body can forget the bombay riots,mani ratnam showed it in movie "bombay",in hrithik roshan's "fiza" too you see it.|`|aYNoQvfMaa	Why are you surprised? I'm certain if a Bollywood filmmaker made a film about life in America it would be just as inaccurate (in fact much of what Bollywood, and Hollywood churns out is inaccurate no matter the context). <br>  <br>  I can list thousands of films that inaccurately portray their subject. Lawrence of Arabia, and Passage to India both had British actors playing Muslims, and Hindus respectively. So did Gandhi. Sahara has German soldiers wearing WWI helmets in WWII. Westerns have consistently portrayed Native Americans in a racist light (to say the least). Gladiator is completely inaccurate. In Braveheart, the real person was a noble, and his father fought for the British, and wasn't killed by them. Amadeus was a genius, not a farting simpleton. All of the films are completely inaccurate, but are great films. Slumdog is not as good as some of those, but it is a good movie.<br>  <br>  When people make films about something they don't understand it's inaccurate. It's no reason to get upset.<br>  <br>  I think you're taking it way too seriously. You're talking about making generalizations and you then say Americans are looters. Let's not forget India is full of female infanticide, and sex selective abortion, so, you're countries hands are not necessarily clean, my friend. It's a movie, if you can't enjoy the experience don't see the movie.

cfdcea076742739e75b363443aad92a9aa	No.  Try converting the movie to wmm format.
4EflpUK8aa	Scared the hell out of me. The end of the first one seemed lame when I saw it the first time, but the second time it scared me to death. The second movie is scary all the way through IMO and I am a veteran horror movie watcher.|`|gUdlaaGwaa	Didn't see the second one because I hated the first so much. There was something very sick about that movie. That noise she makes is disgusting.|`|SKCu5wigaa	Quite a few people think they're boring/suckish, but I disagree. Both the originals (Ju-On) and the American remakes put a new spin on horror, aside from the normal serial killer/bloodbath, monsters, etc. that we're used to seeing. True some of the effects were terrible (esp. in the first Ju-on) and the acting could've been better at parts, but the strange plot makes up for it.|`|Tq2ecVxNaa	I was with a bunch of friends and we just made fun of it the whole time, for me it wasn't scary at all.<br>  One of my friends did get scared and every now and then I come up to her doing that noise just to get a laugh. Haha.|`|XEGG1l6Raa	they were creepy- especially the Japanese version - ''Ju-On''|`|BLmfR6Ezaa	They creeped me out when i was watching them but after they were done i realized how lame they were haha|`|6etaFOnhaa	EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME LOL.

qhqUXL9uaa	she really shouldn't!! once a woman beater always a woman beater he should get jail time for what e did and she shouldn't forgive him whether she really loves him or not cause if he really loved her he wouldn't hit her. They would be able to talk out there arguments and he should be able to walk away when things get to hard for him. She shouldnt go back into a abusive relationship.|`|2WWEn2mZaa	Yes she will. Which is why I didn't have this feeling of OMG I can't believe he did that.|`|MNa3e8Mdaa	she already did!|`|i7F3gl3Yaa	Rumor is she already has....<br>  <br>  From one has seen this, it can only happen once OR the one time turns out to be one of many. <br>  <br>  Who knows which one Chris' actions fall under....|`|2GB6LyTMaa	yeh i saw dem<br>  <br>  if she truly loves him<br>  <br>  she probably will forgiv him<br>  <br>  x|`|78z7gk7naa	Not sure, but I think she shouldn't.|`|nvPYB9lQaa	kinda but it all depends on if she thinks if he is gonna do it again or not
jHDeIPEfaa	First, I would put money into trusts for my children and future grandchildren, go on a long, long vacation with my entire family, give my family money, pay off all my family's bills and help the charities of my choice. If I saw a struggling family that was actually trying to make it, I would pay their bills also.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	There is this sales insurance agent who I love very much and he is a very hot, attractive, handsome and sexy man who has a great and fantastic body. His whole body is perfect and excellent in every way. His name is Robert C. Reisig.<br>  I would pay for our wedding.  I would buy a house for us. I would buy nice clothes for him and me. I also would buy two nice new cars one for him and one for me.<br>  <br>  <br>  I also would help people who are poor and I would give to different charities.|`|MUEsS8tYaa	Buy my parents a house and each of them a car. And do the same for my hubbys parents. Also give them all enough money to retire and not have to work again. Pay off my moms medical bills. Then I'd buy a house for us. Furnish it, and be a stay at home mommy so I could be with my baby boy. O and buy my hubby his dream car. lol|`|df7eb800ff0d3d2aec218aae79b6f9cfaa	Well, first I would start at home. I would pay off our tax debt. student loans and credit card bills. I would purchase a home and nice dependable car. I would start a savings account for my three kids. <br>  Then I would help others in need. I would give to animal shelters and local food banks.|`|LbEGDUX0aa	Give away a bunch of it. It makes no sense to me with all the rich people and money in this country, people still go hungry and live in crappy houses.|`|usIma0vIaa	Well I would help the poor,have fun with the money,and burn it.|`|l5klWLwdaa	Hire a personal trainer to help me drop weight...O, tried that didn't work.<br>  Hire a personal chef to help me drop weight...O, damn didn't work either.<br>  Rehire trainer.. O, damn still fat!<br>  <br>  Screw it, create my own entertainment company to produce movies, books, magazines etc. Put myself on the cover constantly.  Create a book club where I declare which works are worthy of reading.<br>  <br>  But to keep from appearing to shallow, give away a bunch of meaningless expensive crap on my show.  Then when I've done my part to generate materialism, criticize my followers and their offspring for their sense of entitlement.<br>  <br>  Now I am better..O, damn still fat.|`|oTumssAJaa	i would give it to charity, make building that will help people like a homeless shelter, and buy a monkey : )|`|lrZXMy6Kaa	the same thing she's doing help my self and others.|`|aABuSUptaa	i wuold put it in the bank for the interest.donate some. and buy some clothes x]

By far. [And they have a hilarious show.]|`|n96Sqc9waa	damn! that hard, i like dragonforces's long @$s guitar solo's though...|`|6IDBlIaMaa	I don't like either one really, dethklok though if I had to pick one.

2sb7tnT9aa	hit    i totally love this band , this kind of music is so cool , and the lyrics too   wish them a Great career and hope one day they'll come in france !|`|oUZLZusjaa	Unlike most of the bands people on here try and sell to me (or at least the ones that they're in or their friends are in or whatever) those guys were actually pretty good. Nothing I'd really listen to regularly, but they had talent, and the songs I listened to were mixed and mastered very well. I don't dig the name though, if I can't figure out how to pronounce it when first reading it, it's probably not gonan stick in my head, and therefore it's not a great band name.|`|oL2qwUwgaa	sounds nice    I just cant seem to get you out of my head...|`|FM9LwJcGaa	not bad... not bad at all. a little to reggae for my preference but thats just me.

Have a good one!!;-)|`|ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	The keywords from your description are: Siblings, mansion, porcelain doll, attic, girl ghost, reciting of a riddle, and, most importantly, the well.  The movie is Child of Glass.<br>  Tintin is correct, I'm just verifying it for ya'.<br>  P.S.--I gave Tintin a "thumb's up". I don't know why I got a "thumb's down".  :(|`|8VJmXRBBaa	Child Of Glass i think.|`|PumYhJSvaa	Secrets in the Attic (The Dollhouse Murders)<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: I think tintin may be right. I just watched a clip from that movie and it seems pretty accurate. Looks interesting, too! <br>  <br>  Anyhow, this plot also reminds me of an Are You Afraid Of the Dark? episode, The Tale of the Doll Maker.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP3WGlDTL4A&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP3WGlDTL...</a><br>  <br>  I love that show.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT AGAIN: Marilyn, I feel your pain.

Best Film - Dawn Of The Dead (the Romero version)  Best Game - Resident Evil (the original)  Best Book - Max Brooks - Zombie Survival Guide    One of the flaws of moving out of my parents house was the fact that my zombie plan has all gone to pot. I'm gonna have to rethink it.|`|hviykDAraa	yeah!!   I dont think i have ever seen a bad Zombie Film yet, and the Channel 4 series 'Deadset. was really good.

I think the gesture is what matters.|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	You can "Fast"  from as many things or  as little  things as you want.   Ash Wed and  every Friday from now on  for six weeks  you can't eat meat. I would suggest Fast from the Crisps since you eat the most of that .    I am Fasting from  Donuts, snack cakes, and Pastries for Lent ( 6 weeks).   I hope I helped you out !!|`|LOFmGU89aa	Nothing.

Why deny myself pleasure?|`|5R8kwmEZaa	It's not really written in stone but usually you would give up 3-5 little things, or one really big thing (or both) <br>  as far as meat goes, you are already supposed to abstain from it on fridays :p  also, another thing that makes a good sacrafice is just fasting(skipping a meal*) at least once a week.<br>          also remember that you are allowed back whatever you gave up on sundays<br>  (one of the little things you could do is just to have 2 instead of 3 bags of crisps a day)<br>  hope i helped some :)|`|dJrJYLBFaa	well you actually arent supposed to give up things that you think you will be fine with out. you are supposed to give up something that is very very hard to go without.<br>  it only has to be one thing.|`|1PN5Ga12aa	my teacher told us not to give anything up but to do 10 promises :) but you can give up how many things you want to =]

qh9EOXKOaa	It's called Roll To Me Del Amitri but people also like the Spin Doctors version it's called the same thing :D
M1ymLE9Paa	Sounds about right.  LOL.  Someone also mentioned The Devil Wears Prada (for Maxie, Kate, and Lulu).  And remember a few years back when Jason lost his memory, but still had all his skills, like in the Bourne Identity?  I wonder if Guza has to worry about copyright infringement (or whatever it's called)?  If he's going to re-do storylines based on movies, I wish he'd watch some romantic films for a change.  It would be a nice change of pace.  ;-)|`|AA11068766	7.

fDQ163B5aa	Well, there are no huge surprises at the a movie theater. You pay for your ticket at the box office, which cost about $10.00 each, once the ticket ripper rips your ticket you keep it, then there's the concession stand where you could buy food (expect long lines on a mid-Saturday night), and I suggest a middle seat once you get to the theater. lol 'scuze the long paragraph. The point is, it isn't like a giant roller coaster with shocking surprises...it's only a place you spend cash to watch movies on a larger screen than your average. don't sweat it =)|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Bring alot of money if you want to buy food etc.  $30 should cover you both.|`|jLvlcoFBaa	You don't need to know anything. You will figure it out when you get there. Who cares if you have never been? She won't.|`|GRryTbKhaa	Hey! I'm a girl, but I think I can help. Go with her to the ticket stand and buy 2 tickets for both of you for the movie that she wants to see, even if you don't want to see it.  Then walk inside casually and go get food- two drinks, a popcorn to share, and if you or her want candy. The food is expensive so bring a lot of money. And the tickets are like $8.50 about. Then go find two seats and sit down and watch to movie. If it's scary, let her squeeze your hand or put your arm around her. If it's funny and she's laughing, laugh with her. Be yourself and have a good time. Whatever you do, don't let her pay. ;)|`|Iswn8gXiaa	depends on where you go, a standard movie theatre with have $9-12 tickets and pricey popcorn to suggest that you pay tickets and she get popcorn    if its a popular movie on its first 2 weeks, get in about 15-20 min early. gives you time to get a good seat and talk    and check movie reviews from reliable sources, good friends or a good movie critic (rolling stones, ebert and roper, NY times, etc) watchout for fake movie reviews from random city newspapers.     nothing screams no second date like a bad movie, unless you both enjoy cracking jokes the whole time    relax, its nothing too complicated    good luck
jL1QuqvZaa	i heard a little bit cooler so long ago, loved it.|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	I like The Cool Kids.  Maybe it's just because I'm from Chicago.

cCndkLG1aa	I have no idea but he was cute when he was still young in Big Daddy, now, he's just average, nothing to be crazy about him.
4biGrjPkaa	Its like a kebab with no meat, its just wrong! Who they getting in her place?|`|z0y9x4aiaa	i know it sucks but apparently they mite get megan fox from wot i've read so far!!|`|AA10368887	The Tomb Raider movies are over. 2 is more than enough.|`|hviykDAraa	It just wont be the same!!   I agree making the film just seems pointless, that character in my eyes was really well suited to Angelina Jolie, itl be really weird watching the 3rd film and her not being in it!! It just wont seem right having another person play the role - even if they are a really talented actress!!|`|bZNAXpusaa	i know what you meen. it pissed me off when they keep changing batman iam hopeing they just stay with this one now|`|k6CSa9caaa	The Tomb Raider films were ruined anyway. I think they should quit turning games into film.|`|hH6LTbEtaa	I couldn't care less she is a man stealing cow !!|`|UaC1fQd5aa	I won't be in a hurry to see it!|`|UhelHiGIaa	Yeah, totally. I don't like Angelina Jolie, but I think she was good at playing Lara Croft. If they bring in a new Tomb Raider it will wreck the whole thing. They can't do a trilogy with 2 different people!   But I suppose they think she is getting too old or something. She should still do it though. Megan Fox would be a rubbish Lara Croft anyway. No offence to her, but she is a bit too toothy.
IZ4DeYfuaa	I don't think that there is an exact band besides the black mages that does maybe im a lion, but this link has the song that I think u want as we well as a download link on the side (it's a youtube video link)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62jE1j8zj...

ZyGyDLsDaa	The Princess Diaries?<br>  <br>  I'm going to check it out at IMDb to see if I'm recalling the correct film. It's the first one that came to mind. // I found this at the IMDb site:<br>  Joe (Hector Elizondo) speaking to Mia (Anne Hathaway): <br>  "Nobody can make you feel inferior without your consent."<br>  <br>  It doesn't have her reply, but perhaps this is it. // Yea! This IS it! I guess I can trust my memory after all! (At 57, one isn't always too certain about that.)|`|d55D0Ci4aa	It is The Princess Diaries  -  when her friend gets mad at her for fixing her hair....|`|eWXkbDAqaa	This was from the movie "The Princess Diaries" staring Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews, released by Disney in 2001. <br>  <br>  The exchange took place between the character Joe (Hector Elizondo) and Mia (Anne Hathaway) when Mia was feeling down about herself. <br>  <br>  The full exchange:<br>  <br>  Joe: But you shouId know that no one can make you feeI inferior without your consent.<br>  <br>  Mia: EIeanor RooseveIt said that.<br>  <br>  Joe: Yes. Another special Iady Iike yourself.<br>  <br>  <br>  Full script from the movie can be found here: <a href="http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/p/princess-diaries-script-transcript-hathaway.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scrip...</a>|`|6NvQKo4Haa	it was The Princess Diaries
do8pdlluaa	well she is pregnant so i'm sure that will delay her comeback<br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bm6ozb" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/bm6ozb</a>|`|CsESHDaDaa	I think that she is going to come back as a stronger woman than she was before. She can just put that situation behind her and just work on her future. <br>  I also think that it would be the WORST thing in the world to get back with him. Why would she do something like that? I hope she isn't that naive.|`|sCnksozaaa	of course she will, she didnt do anything worng, so she didnt lose fans, she doesnt even need to bounce back, chris however, is another story|`|WU6Ytstgaa	she'll bounce back|`|gEPbqroHaa	yeeah! she's a good singer and no matter what happened a man shouldn't put hes hand on a woman. I dont know about chris career, but if she gets back with chris then it might not bounce back|`|qOKFuXfLaa	I'm confident she will bounce back- she has so much fan support. According to what we know, she hasn't lost anything. Chris Brown's the one whos screwed and may never bounce back to what he was. He lost endorsements, radio stations aren't playing his music, everyone is boycotting him, etc. <br>  If she does take him back, then this will be like Ike & Tina Turner all over again. I hope the rumors are false.|`|Kx0XoZpmaa	It'll probably be hard for her to get back to the way she was before. She'll probably be wary about being alone with guys or having a bf now. She probably is going to stay out of the spotlight for the time being and recover with her family. I think it would be a big mistake for her to get back with Chris. I mean how can she ever forgive him for something like that?
IdGbtvaLaa	Dr.Markway is a manipulator<br>  Eleanor insecure and filled with guilt<br>  Theodora is confident and appealing<br>  Luke is a "hip" guy, playboy wannabe<br>  yes, I've seen it....Hill House has an evil history with tragic accidents, suicide, and human misjudgement. Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson) is apyschic researcher who assembles a group with histories linked to the paranormal. Eleanor (Julie Harris) was the subject of unexplained polterguist activities as a child. She also is riddled with guilt over her mother's death. Theadora (Claire Bloom) is a clairevoyant who befriends Eleanor at Hill House. Russ Tamblyn plays the cynical scion of the owners sent to make sure that the property is not affected by the researchers. Together the grouup explore Hill House, and their own insecurities. Director Robert Wise created a taught drama where the real question is who is haunted and who may be unstable.|`|2g8m8USQaa	I did not see the 1963 version...I saw the remake in 1999, I think it was. Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones,Lili Tayor and Owen Wilson starred in it. <br>  <br>  I will look for the '63 version. The '99 version was good but until you mentioned the previous verson, I had nothing to compare it to.<br>  <br>  EMT
KhGkc2QGaa	that's a really good idea. I've seen people spell music "muzik." it's pathetic|`|cbZdeOSPaa	Sounds like a good idea!     BQ: Band names, particularly: Lynyrd Skynyrd and Led Zeppelin. And song titles, they are either mispelled or mislabeled.|`|rR6lwxjjaa	wut due euw meen?

Go for it.    Personally, I don't worry too much about spelling in here. Take it with a grain of salt, you might have phat phingers someday too.

AA10197672	Mine did not. I am scorpio and he was a taurus. He was  very sweet and  nice, however the biggest liar on this planet. He would manipulate is way around everything. I got fed up and left!. I am with Cancer now and much much happier since he is very loyal and cares about honesty and trust like I do...|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Is supposed to be good match, yes. Especially if the woman is the Scorpio and the guy is the Taurus. She will appreciate his desire to look after her and provide everything she needs. this will make her feel at ease and won't allow her to become too jealous or possesive. If the Scorpio is a good cook and the Taurus is good in bed it will help! haha|`|7w0y0nfgaa	Scorpio is deep -very deep-  which may be a problem because taurus doesn't wear it's heart on it's sleeve either. It may be difficult for this pair to get together, because neither is naturally inclined to make the first move. Taurus stands in awe of the power and intensity of Scorpio mind, while the Scorpion is interested in the Bull's affable and friendly qualities, so an enduring relationship could be forged if the couple ever get round to talking. Both are lovers of home and family, which will help to cement a relationship. Star rating : **|`|LU0tIFcRaa	I think so, our scorpio is suppoded to be our match because they're our oppostie. I'm a taurus and I love scorpios, they are so loyal! My best friend is one, my little sister is one, and I knew a few guys who were scorpios. But that is a combination that is supposed to work, our signs have a lot of similarities. And they are sooooo incredibly sexy and mysterious, also jellous. <br>  <br>  P.S. I would like to give a shot out to all the scoripo men, holla at me!|`|G3lkvGfDaa	I've read that it does work out for some reason.  You never know unless you try it out.|`|xEWVqdwnaa	hell yea<br>  if you work at it|`|JoKF90wHaa	I'm a taurus and all my friends are Tauruses or Scorpios, so definitely it can work out.<br>  <br>  I had a Scorpio girlfriend and we both worked great together but she was a liar so I had to go. But me and scorpios ALWAYS get along. (Not the liar types though) So definitely can.

ycNt74yyaa	OMG you should know this. Bigger is better.|`|6pToGVZNaa	if you want to play gigs then get the 25 ft. thats what i use but when im at home i use a shorter 18 or 16 ft
xUuqcKWoaa	20 feet is fine.  longer cable=less signal . only my opinion, i have used them up to 2 cords together.|`|Sow1mTFuaa	If you're gigging go with the 25 for sure, you never know when you will need that extra few feet to maneuver around obstacles on the stage or just have the ability to roam. And unless you are a dog you will hear no difference in sound between the two sizes.
qOKFuXfLaa	Everything I know is on TMZ.COM|`|UF9MVdSXaa	Chris Brown, beat Rihanna (Yeah we all know that) But for as the real story nobody will ever know what really happened tho.|`|05aKFYl5aa	basically they were in the car and chris brown got a text from a girl. rihanna saw and got mad and demanded that he take her home. he refused so she got took his keys out of the ignition and threw them on the street. then he started to beat her and ran away.|`|zrKuaiDLaa	Rhianna has herpes and gave it to Chris Brown.

Can I leave now?|`|SYDaRM11aa	Chris Brown punched/slapped Rhianna|`|2eZmxkCZaa	After a before grammy's party, Rihanna and Chris Brown parked on the side of a road and got into a fight. So far, rumors are saying their fight was about him being jealous because she was more popular, her being mad because he cheated/or looked at other girls, he wanted to break up she didnt, or the most popular one, she gave him an stds. No one knows for sure. Chris Brown starting beating Rihanna, and she had major contusions, a broken jaw, bite marks, bruises, a bloody nose, and a split lip. She was in the hospital for quite sometimes. It is also said that he punched her repeatedly and slapped her upside the head. Chris Brown then left Rihanna knocked out in his rented lamborghini and ran away on foot. After Rihanna woke up, she called the police and told them Chris Brown had abused her. Chris Brown hid from the police, and was then either caught, or turned himself in and bailed himself out for $50k. He now has a March 5th court date and will probably be facing 5-10 years in jail. Rihanna has broke up Chris Brown, and is recovering with her family in her hometown in Barbados. There are pictures on the internet of what she looks like now. Other rumors are that he got a text from a girl and Rihanna got mad. And that Rihanna threw his keys out the car. He also choked/strangled her and threatened to kill her.|`|QkOeODxLaa	Chris Brown got a txt in the car from another girl, rihanna got mad and threw the keys of the car out the window chris went to look for them could'nt find them so he started beating up rihanna she became unconcious but chris left n e ways and the herpes is a rumor, but if it was true chris woulldn't hav beat her up bcuz of that he would hav bcuz it meant she was with another man.....but herpes is a rumor but a lot of ppl r gonna say that|`|WAuooQJ1aa	He beat her and bit her a bunch of times. After the fight was over, he reported himself to the police. Rhianna still hasn't decided weather or not she is going to get back with him, but most of her fan base wants her to be strong and leave him.|`|2GB6LyTMaa	well apparently dey cme bk from thee pre grammys nd a woman text chris brown...so rihanna gorr pissed off thru owr his lambourghini keys....he searched fow dem fow ages...he ***** find dem...he beath thee crap owr ov her...nd told her he wud kill her..he left her unconcious..den he tuned himself in 1 hour nd 30 mins later....<br>  <br>  <br>  another story is dah at thee pre-grammy awards she was dancin wiv otha guys no one really knws<br>  <br>  x|`|e2eabfcbd8bf3fdebe6d842f47ed3764aa	OOOh I heard a rumor that the only reason he hit her was b/c she gave him herpes.

3dcc2948a003c40d98c8ef0d9a516e9baa	I'm assuming you're talking about the Kubrick 1970s version.    I'm not crazy about gory slasher flicks (with a few exceptions), and I don't think of The Shining as a gory movie.  HOWEVER, there are two "gory" parts.  First, there's a scene of two kids hacked to pieces.  You don't see them being hacked up, you just see the end result in a very quick flash, but there's blood all over the walls and hacks marks, etc.  The only other scene I can think of is when one character hacks another in the chest with an axe.      The Shining doesn't get it's scariness from torture or seeing people hacked up.  That's not what makes it scary.  I haven't heard anyone complain about how gory it was.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	A few scenes.  It's a fantastic movie.  Rent the original.|`|xPwTDOh3aa	make sure you get the original one with jack nicholson its not that gory in more of a mental thriller|`|jLvlcoFBaa	It has a little.    Several times in this movie, you see blood coming out of an elevator that the boy sees in his mind. Later in the movie a woman sees the same thing.    There is a scene where you see two mangled dead bodies of girls in a corridor surrounded by pools of blood.    A young naked woman turns into an aged rotting corpse that then comes to life and briefly chases a man.    A woman threatens a man with a baseball bat. The man threatens to bash her brains in. The woman hits the man in the head with the baseball bat.    A man smashes down doors with an axe while a woman hides ready to defend herself with a knife. She slices the man's hand with a knife.    In the middle of a rather intense scene, a bleeding man, who we know to be dead, raises his glass and says, "Great party, isn't it?"    A woman runs into a room full of dust covered corpses.    A man is killed after being hit in the chest by an axe, the scene is very graphic and intense.    There is a frozen dead body wearing a grimacing expression with its eyes open .|`|hA6JDWsFaa	not really. actually, no. not at all.|`|st90uycUaa	its not very gory..and i understand how you feel because im a horror movie lover but i dont like a lot of gore, i dont really get disgusted with it i just feel sometimes its not nessacary to be overly gory...    but i think you should be ok..although not to spoil it but as a heads up theres one scene when this young naked woman in the bathroom turns very old and has like decaying skin..that grossed me out big time..but otherwise its all good|`|wWZcHKKTaa	Its not gory at all.  The newer one isn't either.|`|sABl6xwMaa	no, you should be o k|`|Yc0FBN52aa	There is some blood but not a lot of gore.|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	It's not that  gory. The guy just goes after his family after going nuts being stuck inside a mansion of a house .   It's not that bad at all  just watch it ,  it's an awesome movie!!|`|NgkkzBOEaa	That's in the eyes of the beholder, but I didn't think that it was that gory for a rated R movie.  Who hates gore?|`|4hzIH4kXaa	Well seeing as it is an 18, a bit. It has a specific repeated scene with a lot of blood (then again that scene isn't specifically gory, it isn't coming from anybody). There are several scenes though were people are killed. I wouldn't call it a gory movie though, there are only a few scenes. It is more of a thriller. A very good movie.  Hope this helps. xx

tuATxHsVaa	You do not need long fingers to learn to play the violin.<br>  <br>  Having long fingers, however, can be quite an asset. <br>  <br>  Everyone has to learn to work with whatever assets God has given them. Perhaps you have better ears or a neck that violins fit nicely on. You'll figure it all out in the long run. <br>  <br>  It's never too late to learn to start, by the way. Make sure you get a private teacher. <br>  <br>  Long fingers will only help you out in really difficult music, but for the most part you will get by fine without them. What you really want is to be able to play in-tune and with proper bow phrasing. You don't need long fingers at all for that. <br>  <br>  There was a pseudo-scientific study a while back that declared that people with long fingers are more musical. Maybe that is what you are referring to. It is well known that long fingers are an asset to pianists; however, on violin, it can be both an asset and a grievance. <br>  <br>  I am a large person with long fingers, and while these fingers help me a lot on violin - they can also hinder. On extremely high notes - it can be difficult for me to play. My fingers are so fat - the distance between the notes and the size of my fingers make it difficult to play them. If your fingers are smaller in diameter than perhaps you will have an easier time hitting those highest notes with precision.<br>  <br>  So - you don't need long fingers.|`|CjPtAEzmaa	I have the shortest fingers ever created, and I play viola, which can get bigger than violins. Long fingers certainly make it easier, but they are also certainly not required. And late learners are awesome! Have lots of fun :) The ability to read music will certainly make it easier.|`|Fb5SRq25aa	no is totally a lie.. :)<br>  I've played the violin seen i was about 4 (high school now)<br>  and my finger are really short.. lol<br>  you'd probably need long fingers for shifting though

ZyGyDLsDaa	The House Without a Christmas Tree (1972 TV movie)  IMDb review:  Lisa Lucas plays Addie, a 10-year-old girl who lives with her widowed father (Jason Robards) and his mother (Mildred Natwick) in Clear River, Nebraska, in the late Forties. Her father is still torn apart over the death of his wife, so much so that he cannot stand to celebrate Christmas and to remember how happy he was when she was alive. To this end, he won't allow a Christmas tree in the house. Addie is determined that she will have a tree this year and tries to convince him to get one. // It's based on the novel by Gail Rock.    Of course, someone else might have used this idea, but it's the first film that came to mind.|`|nci2WOYXaa	Not sure

ONimpwumaa	I LOVE ALL OF BRITNEYS SONGS!!! jsyk its britney not birtney!!|`|wfWAlztVaa	It's called If You Seek Amy  it's supposed to be clever  because it's about going to a party and looking for a girl named Amy  and she also uses it in the lyrics "all of the boys and all of the girls want to If You Seek Amy"  Which, if said aloud, sounds like F-U-C-K me, which is like, the point of the song.  I don't get why people are getting offended, there's much worse songs out. And it's really catchy, so if you don't mind the innuendo, I'd reccommend listening to it :)|`|MkchPOjFaa	really? do you know the name of it?    yea just heard it...it sounds like shes sayin F.U.C.K me...when its actually if you seek amy...or is it? anyway i like the song thats pretty good whoever thought of it|`|siPlI0y9aa	Some parents thought the title "If U Seek Amy" sounds like "F-U-C-K Me" when said aloud and sung. In a Rolling Stone magazine interview, parents were quoted as saying, "I was astonished and totally taken aback when I heard my 5 and 7 year old kids walking around the house singing 'F-U-C-K' ... When I asked them what it was, they told me it was Britney Spears. I was horrified". Rolling Stone defended Spears, arguing that parents should have been aware of the singer's musical themes. The Parents Television Council cautioned radio stations and cable music channels about broadcasting the music video for this song for the same reason.    Due to this reaction to the music, in the US, the radio single was released as "If U See Amy".The "If U See Amy" version will just be released to American radio, with the music video and the international radio single being both "If U Seek Amy".|`|xhSsby6Taa	she talks about all the guys lusting after her and then the chorus goes into "if you seek amy" -- if you say it a few times, it should like she's spelling out the f word followed by "me" as in what the guys want to do with her.|`|110bfb5c5bdf0d48f352357b2d6fe8d4aa	she actually says F-U-C-K ME & not "if you seek amy"  smart huh?!|`|69IASzcUaa	well she has two new songs womanizer and circus heres the lyrics see for yourself..

NwYwLdsNaa	Philanthropy  In 1998, Winfrey began Oprah's Angel Network, a charity aimed at encouraging people around the world to make a difference in the lives of underprivileged others. Accordingly, Oprah's Angel Network supports charitable projects and provides grants to nonprofit organizations around the world that share this vision. To date, Oprah's Angel Network has raised more than $51,000,000 ($1 million of which was donated by Jon Bon Jovi). Winfrey personally covers all administrative costs associated with the charity, so 100% of all funds raised go to charity programs.[113]    Although Winfrey's show is known for raising money through her public charity and the cars and gifts she gives away on TV are often donated by corporations in exchange for publicity, behind the scenes Winfrey personally donates more of her own money to charity than any other show-business celebrity in America. In 2005 she became the first black person listed by Business Week as one of America's top 50 most generous philanthropists, having given an estimated $303 million.[114] Winfrey was the 32nd most philanthropic. She has also been repeatedly ranked as the most philanthropic celebrity[115]    In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Oprah asked her viewers to open their heartsand they did. As of September 2006, donations to the Oprah Angel Network Katrina registry total more than $11 million. Homes have been built in four statesTexas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabamabefore the one year anniversary of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.[116] Winfrey also matched her viewers' donations by personally giving $10 million to the cause.[117]    Winfrey has also put 250 African-American men through college[118]    Winfrey was the recipient of the first Bob Hope Humanitarian Award at the 2002 Emmy Awards for services to television and film.    To celebrate two decades on national TV, and to thank her employees for their hard work, Winfrey took her staff and their families (1065 people in total) on vacation to Hawaii in the summer of 2006|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Helping Barack Obama Become President and selling off New cars to all of her Audience Members, If said anymore It will take forever.|`|a950da063e9c670dfa13b1fd89d288ddaa	The Africa school of hers.|`|DSSio06daa	I think she has been a contributor to the harmful attitude that many blacks have of excessive entitlement, I really do, and it doesn't help them and it doesn't help anyone.

zGXeBBloaa	300. it came out last year|`|RJZQsBqbaa	Its 300, but I don't know if you will enjoy it.  Its not like a regular World War II movie, its a lot more fantasy based.  But give it a shot, you never know.|`|6LkdDQ3Baa	The movies is "300"|`|tbOCqkkZaa	300 is the film|`|jdYN69ZKaa	I do believe it is called 300.
7u9jOxu8aa	Probably, I usually find that watching the Japanese version, which is the true, original version of what the anime should be is always better than a dub.  It's only good if you start with the English and have never seen the subs.|`|YYJlzTwxaa	japanese version is always better than the english version  between sub and dub, in the dub, more is lost in translation  secondly, the english versions are usually edited and/or censored for the american audience  third, gt was pretty terrible, but go ahead if you want to...i think that DB was getting to the point where the characters were becoming too overpowering and god-like---maybe that's why they ended with gt|`|szJSaZspaa	i grew up watching the dubbed version so im used to it but the subbed is better. get the uncut dvd.

YIcBd569aa	everyone is answering your question but they are leaving out key points.   1. this episode on the island they are trying to show us what happened to locke that got him in a coffin to begin with. so seeing him in a coffin its a flash forward. and they are going back to show what happen to the losties that were on the island after the frozen donkey wheel was turned by ben.    2. locke was told by jacob in the cabin to move the island, but only ben knew how to do that. ben told locke the reason jacob told you to move the island but didn't tell you how is because once you turn that wheel you can never come back to the island again. so ben realized that jacob wanted him to move the island and not locke. so ben went down into the hatch and turned the frozen donkey wheel and the island dissapeard and ben ended up in the dessert in turnisa. and the rest of the island inhabitants are jumping back and forth through time .    3. the white light had something to do with the magnetic forsces that helped to keep the island hidden from radar, planes boats ect. once that key was turned the hatch emploded and the island was visible again and that is how the frieghter people were able to find it. pennys boat saw it on radar too. so the island became visibble to outsiders.    4.its believed it is because the donkey wheel was turned that the island is in a time flux. but its just speculation that the o6 are like a constant to the island and they island will realign itself with time once they return. but thats just speculation on the fans part. we have not been told what or why they must go back yet. we were only told they ones left on the island will die if the oeanic 6 don't return.    5. ferraday was sent by widmore to find the island he is part of a science team.   www.E.W. com or Lost wikkipedia.com|`|lfgl8X5Yaa	1.  Locke is on the island but before the time that we see him in the coffin.    2.  Ben turned the wheel, and the island disappeared.      3.  Some kind of pressure was released.  Didn't really seem to do anything at that time.      4.  When the island disappeared after Ben turned the wheel, the people on the island (not the Others) started moving through time.      5.  He was sent by Charles Widmore to help find the island.      www.thefuselage.com is an awesome sight.|`|WoOpvvunaa	Locke was in a coffin because it was a flash forward. Not in the present. All the stuff thats happening with Locke, Jack, Kate and the others off the island are set in the future. While the stuff thats happening on the island is set in the present. When Ben moved the wheel, it was a time machine that sent him to Iraq and was able to get to everyone. As for the farraday guy, I'm guessing seeing how he's the physicist and time expert, he wanted to go back to the island so he can see if time travel is possible. As for the site? Just google lost. I sometimes have problems with the show to and there are plenty of sites on the show. Hope I helped.|`|py0DpCh4aa	1.How can Locke be in a coffin back in the US yet were watching him run around on the island at the same time?  Locke is traveling through time on the Island, going back & forth.  he is in a coffin in LA because that is the future.    2.In the previous season, when the other's leader (can't remember his name) turned that big wheel/cog thing, what happened? and why did he turn it?  When he turned it the island's location moved.   he turned it so Charles' whitmore couldn't find the island.    3.Back a few seasons when desmond turned that keyswitch to "save the island" what happened in that white light?   Not sure    4.Are the people left on the island, ferraday, locke etc, getting sucked through time as a result of the oceanic six leaving?  Yes ; No.  They're being sucked back  &forth through time as a result of Ben's turning the wheel at the end of last season.    5. I can't remember if this was ever answered, but why and how did the Ferraday guy get to the island? What was his reason for going there?  I am not sure...  I don't think that's been answered yet..|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	1. Locke's in the coffin 4 years in the future. On the island it's still 2004, but when Ben moved the donkey wheel it caused the Island to "travel" through time. So this week when Locke meets up with Richard its 50 years in the past...1954. Locke needs Richard's help to get off the island in present time.    2. Ben moved the island becasuse Widmore hired the science crew and the mercenaries to find the suvivors and kill them and take over the island. Ben knew that the island would be harmed in Widmore's care so he needed to "move'' the island.    3. Good question.    4. No, the people are moving through time as a result of the island being "moved"    5. Farraday is with the scientific crew hired by Widmore. He's there because he's an expert on time travel and possibly worked for the Dharma initiative at one point.    6. Go to Lostpedia.com for all things lost. It has anything and everything you need to know.|`|40qrABWsaa	if you dont know the answers to these questions you have not watched all of the last season or you dont remember i would recomend renting or buying the last seasons to refresh.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	1. Locke is in a coffin in the future, remember they just got off the island, so what's happening on the island is the present (with time jumps), and what's going on the the Oceanic 6 is in the future, except when they show them talking about what they're gonna do when they get home.    2. Ben turned the wheel because "Jacob" (still don't know what/who he is) said that it was best for the island to be moved. He was also sent to the future somehow...    3. Nothing happened in the white light, as far as the viewers know, so far...    4. Maybe... but it's also because the island was moved, but it might also be because the Oceanic 6 left and now they have to get back to stop time from jumping.    5. Faraday got sent to the island along with the people on the freighter by Charles Widmore. He was on the science team.      Check out Lostpedia.com! It's an awesome website!

OhmERQaMaa	I've been watching this one too and I was also very confused. My best friend has a major pain killer addiction that I have been trying to help him with so I thought maybe I could learn something from this show. I've never seen it smoked before and don't understand why someone would smoke a pill but I guess it gets you high as shown in the show. I wondered what in the world they were doing too so I googled "how to smoke oxycotin" LOL... and as per some person named "dankmat" on a website called topix.com hsaid, this is how it works:    "  They melt on foil but will flare up if u dont keep it sliding & it will waste & bubble, they not flamable like gunpowder or something, i use a lil drop of water or jus dissolve the coating in my mouth & the moisture keeps it from flaring up, burns slower &they stick & slide down the foil better, i use like mid grade foil not the super heavy thick stuff, & not the super thin chinese crap foil it will burn through , I strach the foil make lil channelscut a 80 in half flat side down ,i use a mini butane torch lighter on low, but for beginners i reccoment a reg flame lighter to prvent waste & flare/igniting the pill,the only thing is a reg lighter creates black soot to build up on the back & some makes it into your lungs so once u get used to the process the butane mini torch is less wasteful u can back track the shiney parts of the skid marks on the foil to make sure u dont waste any,always smoke em shiney side down...i wish i never learned to smoke oc's, i used to be happy to eat/chew up a couple 40's or a 80 a day,now i use up avg 6 80s a day, i been using ocs for like 8 yrs but smoking them the past 2,i dont recommend anyone start,its less addictive to shoot em even,stick to snorting or eating "    so i guess little pieces of pill are just sliding around melting as they are being chased by the heat under the foil. when the kid in the episode was holding the foil sideways,maybe he was just trying to get residue off it or something.    I used to play with drugs and am very lucky to have never become hooked. Ive been drug and alcohol free for 5 yrs now by choice and I just hope and pray for anyone who is trying to get clean. You can do it!|`|AA12160555	Using foil like this is refered to "freebaseing" or smoking.. this method is also commonly used for coke.. I wouldnt advise doing this but to each his own I guess.
DibFrwxlaa	Without clicking on the link, would that be Human League?    I love that song.  I love how the dude thinks he's all that in his verse and then the girl is like, "meh, whatever."    Oh yeah, maybe you know this already and that's why you posted the link but I think at one point Bowie called these guys the future of pop.    Anyway, the cheesiest 80s song is  Mickey - Toni Basil  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHN16DCAy...  The video with the cheerleaders is better but I can't find it anymore.    ---------------------  Yeah, yeah that one.  I love that.  No one would dare make a video like that these days.|`|7B2s7maWaa	I love that song.  No lies that song is fun to sing and blast in the car.  xD    bq:'Take on Me'-A! Ha|`|yctQjQDTaa	AHH! That is definitely in my Top 10 80s Pop songs, its just so wonderfully synth-y and catchy, and I don't find it cheesy at all.... music is just personal preference after all!    BQ: I don't think its cheesy, but: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQHrspjw4...    there are plenty of others I love though, but its too many to list!    edit: Jimmy Jazz, you mean this?: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKqp8Ouya...    its made of WIN.|`|NourECCgaa	ba: definately blue monday by new order. See what happens when Ian Curtis dies?|`|vyHe3Lfdaa	It's not bad nor good.  I'm indifferent with it I guess.    BQ: You Spin Me Round Like A Record - Dead Or Alive  = P|`|AA11518803	Your question reminds me of an old Zippy the Pinhead comic. In one frame Zippy says "I once had a horse with no name, but that was back in the Seventies - and they didn't exist".     It's fun to sing at karaoke- it's like cheese on top of cheese. I lived through the Eighties, so it's nostalgia for me- even if that decade didn't exist.    Here's one for you...more cheese than there is in all of Philadelphia...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ9TfJjKH...|`|WU4MHq3aaa	BQ:Livin On A Prayer.... sad such a cool song got overplayed and used by poseurs... ohhh EDIT: somebody put Sunglasses at ?Night and that has GOT to be it...|`|PRDZmeiEaa	Um....

I do    >THE HUMAN LEAGUE BLOW MY MIND! THEY ARE ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! or exclamation? or question mark ?     BA: ALL OF THEM!!!!!!!!!!|`|nU7yv87Vaa	It's in my top 5 synthpop songs... The Human League has an amazing synth sound. Their song The Sound of the Crowd demonstrates that even better.    BQ: '80s pop is one of my favorite genres, so that's difficult. I don't really consider it cheesy, but my overall favorite would probably be Voices Carry by 'Til Tuesday.|`|9TWdWoTwaa	What the heck is wrong with you? Are you trying to kill me you sod. I AM BRITAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|fJPc6Iayaa	Favorite 80's song- " You Spin Me Round" by Dead or Alive|`|yjSGVfdiaa	oof... the 80s could be a poisonous time, couldn't they.....  although remarkably catchy...

KLNLfYQeaa	on stage at the reunion they decided to 'give it a try'. but she ended up breaking up with him after that.    here's the full site on it;  http://blog.vh1.com/2009-01-28/corn-fed-...    nothing really happened, it was just talk and boring. with little insults thrown in here and there.    yeah I know what you mean about those 2 girls, I personally would've paid someone to kick their asses. I was so glad he didn't pick bay bay bay the most though.    oh, and Chance had to make the decision on who he would've picked, he finally decided risky.. woopie doo though lol.    prepare for Real Chance of Love 2 & Charm Girls!|`|qTKkMP8qaa	real and cornfed are still together and  her hair got longerr !    nothing happened no fights, kinda boring.  but they did ask chance who would he pick if he did find love  he said riski.    BAY BAY BAY- is so annoying !    oh yeah and milf didnt go to the reunion. &  Bubbles had a mouth fight with So Hood !|`|HnEXBbjvaa	theyre giving it a chance....corn fed looks horrible..trying to get a tan and be more "ethnic" with that hair extensions.|`|ZKVlF2pKaa	Corn fed and Real are still together although this time Real is going to take things a little slower, because he realized he was rushing things way too much when he proposed to Hoops and he doesn't want to sabotage his own relationship with her.    Chance said he'd of picked Risky if he was forced to choose on person, but only if he'd been forced to choose and wants to leave things the way he left.    We found out Bubbles is actually studying Psychology and has 3.5 grade point average.    So Hood tells him she still has mad love and respect for Chance and there are no hard feelings. She yells at Bubbles and calls her stupid and other stuff when Bubbles tells Chance he lacks focus and needs to learn to control his anger. Bubbles responds to So Hoods taunts by saying "If I'm so dumb and you're smart, define Positive Reinforcement." And So Hood is like "don't talk to me or I'll Positively reinforce your ***." And Bubbles is like "I'm not even going to get into with you. Because I want to build people up not bring them down or insult them." And then she just ignores Chance and So Hood's stupid babbling.    Rabbit said it's stupid that she got eliminated for what she did. And maybe she would've tried harder if Chance tried harder. Chance finally told her STFU with that again, you got the show's concept all backward. It's my show, and my choice. It was about me. *In not quite those words)    Kiki said she doesn't really take back what she said about Lusty's mom. Chance doesn't regret what he did to Sexy Legs because he felt like she was too tall for him and his brother anyway. Real is like why are you mad at my brother when she tells him to kiss her *** basically and she just gets this smile on her face like wow, I really dodged a bullet on this one after the whole interview is over.    Um, I think that's all the highlights. Go to Vh1.com to see highlights and extra stuff they didn't show you on TV on the reunion (including a hilarious thing where Stalker tells Chance to come out the closet and he calls her Sasquatch.

S71MT9USaa	Direct deposit is between your employer and your bank. My guess is that the employer will not do it on a part time job it as it costs them a fair amount to set it up - - but it doesn't hurt to ask, it also saves them some money in processing each transaction.|`|p03Jc7eHaa	give them a void check|`|IizPFrELaa	Your company has to offer it, if so then they would have the sign up form.|`|sei8yDeGaa	You have to make sure that your job offers direct deposit and if they do then they usually just require you to bring them a voided check.
DLaPjWpHaa	i actually like this season's cast, they're all so different but i must admit there isn't as much drama as i had hoped for:]|`|HBFHZXybaa	It's a good cast. But it doesn't seem like there will be a lot of drama.|`|wdLzpIAiaa	they're so boring..!!|`|9561bfcf1a05d328055061d4b26e8f40aa	I think it doesnt show the real brooklyn , they hang out in clubs in Manhattan ..           ryan acts like a child  Baya does not know how to dance  Deven is too cooky  Scot is very atractive  Chet is very cool  for a mormon  Sarah is awesome and she accept people for who they are  And Katlyn is really cool and sweet.  And the other guy .. damn i forgot his name..  he is very boring , didnt get a chance to know more about him|`|ouFJ7JUZaa	i watched a few episodes, i live in brooklyn, but these people are not going into the "real" brooklyn. They spend majority of their time in manhattan. So it should of been "real world manhattan". For the people, they seem very boring, there are no hardcore party girls that'll start drama. Drama is what made these shows. They seem like they're all goody goodies. It's really freaky to have a transexual, bisexual gay person on tv. it's really really strange. I'd be scared of that person. Imagine cathing something you think is a girl in the bathroom peeing standing up. Damn, that'd scar me. The guy who wins the 6pack challenges i don't see anything good looking about him. He has a great body, but ugly face. The girls are ugly. There is no Shavonda from the australia hottie, no hottie party girl like Tristen (or whatever her name is) from las vegas.     I remember the real world in Colorado they had a big black guy fighting with a white gay guy who called the black guy a "n..i..g..g..e..r" Then some drama escalated.    This new real world Brooklyn, very boring. I feel like i'm watching the modern day brady bunch.|`|AA10860665	I don't like this one.  No one is really that attractive.  That one guy is kinda cute, (the one the black girl likes) but not all that.  They have a confused man on there.  He is transsexual, gay, and a bissexal lesbian?  What a mess. And he became a she to be all that stuff at one time?  What a pure mess.  And where are the real world hook-ups we are use to?  Nobody is even attracted to one another. And that army guy...really boring.  Nobody is edgy or mysterious.

Im just addicted to VH1 reality so even if they put the DUMBEST show on earth on there I would watch it LoL... it's just so FUNNY!|`|AA10860665	Yes i think this is stupid.  And he has no shirt on in the promo like I've never seen biceps b4! Please.  I've seen better bodies.  Not only that he is cute in the face, but he reminds of a kid.  Brandi's little brother for Goodness sakes.  They had some girl doing a split and shaking her behind all at the same time.  So it will be the usual professional strippers, and trash bag chicks.
rR6lwxjjaa	lol oh i know that look, sometimes me and my friends take my friends van and when we pull up to stoplights we open up the side sliding doors and lean out and dance. then when it turns green we peal out lol    plus i blare metalcore out of my system in parking lots and stuff :)|`|3dpIt3PIaa	Many times!

I hate when people do that. (Unless you're blaring a good song, in which case it is completely acceptable)   Even worse is when you're on a bus with a radio, and it's on some sh*tty station, and the people on the bus start singing along.

Mostly cause when I driving myself I'm not huge on blaring music anyway.    But if I'm driving with a few friends, they'll rip through my portable CD case that I carry often grabbing something to play as they know that death will occur if they change the radio station.

CqQpUdntaa	Well when I used to tend bar, which was at a little place where 20 to 25 people was a crowd, we would pay the Karaoke DJs anywhere from $100 to $300. Of course the people we payed $300 for were more experienced and usually provided a better show of course. But, it wasn't uncommon for them to receive a tip. If you're thinking of starting up just make sure you have a lot of everything. Don't limit yourself to just one age group. Also, the better ones always had creative ideas for entertainment whenever no one would sing. I know my favorite was this one guy who would throw on these quick costumes and sing and dance as Elvis, Elton John, Jimi Hendrix, and any other wild looking singers.

CvtDsOB4aa	The first known electrically illuminated Christmas tree was the creation of Edward H. Johnson, an associate of inventor Thomas Edison. While he was vice president of the Edison Electric Light Company, a predecessor of today's Con Edison electric utility, he had Christmas tree light bulbs especially made for him. He proudly displayed his Christmas tree, which was hand-wired with 80 red, white and blue electric indandescent light bulbs the size of walnuts, on December 22, 1882 at his home on Fifth Avenue in New York City. Local newspapers ignored the story, seeing it as a publicity stunt. However, it was published by a Detroit newspaper reporter, and Johnson has become widely regarded as the Father of Electric Christmas Tree Lights. By 1900, businesses started stringing up Christmas lights behind their windows. Christmas lights were too expensive for the average person; as such, electric Christmas lights did not become the majority replacement for candles until 1930.    http://askville.amazon.com/tradition-put...|`|	Actually it was General Electric.

vDjy1eKDaa	yesss..this year, Korn is goin back into the studio with the original producer who produced their self-titled and "Issues" albums, Ross Robinson. Jonathan Davis said that they will be going back to their old nu-metal selves. Im hoping Head will return. It is a possibility he will return, but Head said only when hes ready to go back.    In an interview, Fieldy stated that Korn would be recording a new album sometime this year (2008), and that it would be a return to their heavy roots. He stated in the same interview that he would also be releasing a solo album of funk and jazz fusion pieces, as well as releasing his own book. The recording of the 9th album should take place early May 2009, with a November 2009 album release, Ray Luzier will take over drumming duties unless David Silveria comes out of his hiatus. It was stated in an Interview by Jonathan that the band hopes to get in the studio with Ross in early May and have their ninth studio album finished by late November 2009. Jonathan also stated that he was excited about this album "because its going to be a return to the old us, its going to be a classic heavy Nu Metal, as fans would call it, album. I've already got some song Ideas and a few album titles, but not a whole lot of progress yet,".|`|sz1YqwUEaa	Korn gave Head to God      No idea what they are doing now.|`|ebxwADDcaa	"my favorite band is Korn"    ? . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-. . . . . . . . . .``~.,  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-. . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . .-.,  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :,  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:. . . ./  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./  . . . . . . /(_. . ~,_. . . ..~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .=,_. . . .-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~; /. .. .}  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .=-._. . .;,,./`. . / . . . ./. .. ../  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../  . . . . . .(. ...`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--      their guitarist turned to religion and quit the band and they havent done anything since.|`|aN7lmNmoaa	the guitarist found god and quit the band.

k9DWHrJ7aa	most, not all, are being done by people who are mischievous because of their or state of mind(childish). however, there are times when an answer should be thumbed down and if it's bad enough, should be reported. everybody is entitled to an opinion. personally, if i don't like or don't understand a question, i just plain @ss don't answer it. how about THAT, emma sue!!|`|IKs0my9aaa	SHOW ME THE LUVE GUYS!!|`|IXgPHYbDaa	Because people like me feel GREAT about giving peps the thumbs down!    :P   it makes me feel sexy|`|Asj4Usqkaa	I didn't think anyone really cared..

Otherwise, everyone gets thumbs up!!!|`|JlUIndykaa	um im greatly annoyed by some answers that's why|`|5ed1y0uuaa	Because they can? I'm not a level 2...boo hoo.|`|1cL06jyTaa	cause people like you piss me off   your so dumb|`|0VAdAPW2aa	This "negative attitude" is used for other people to view people's opinions about other people's answers. This isn't really a 'NO, YOU ARE WRONG' thing, just a reference for others.|`|zb4tj2ZZaa	If you can get away with it do it. Simple moral code of people on the internet.|`|6Dec7NFPaa	Cause people will hate people.  (I wish that everyone could like MOST people)  But...  Some people just hate everything|`|HhPgZDDzaa	Some people are mean just to be mean. If they don't agree with an answer, then they give it a thumbs down. I was stupid and asked an opinion question about abortion, and anyone who was pro-choice or thought it was ok in some instances got a thumbs down. People are opinionated and stubborn, and everyone has to have the same opinion as them or they are a bad person|`|0hnh10jYaa	we cant all just get along that would make life no fun.....and we will only better our self's with some constructive criticisms.|`|87KMkWLuaa	u have to meet the nice people|`|MMdWfD1baa	That's exactly what I always think.  Why can't people use good language and be kind to everyone on the site?  I guess that's just the way some people are.|`|RyQsmWWgaa	Because 50% of  ppl are bi!*hes and want to hurt others..and the other 50% actually care and want to make their feelings known.|`|oK0frWxMaa	ill tell u y becuz people want to act tough and cool on a computerhere  in real life they cant say **** to anyone in ther face|`|Bc2W0U4Raa	I can tell you, some of the thumbs down are re for good reason and deserve them for either ignorant answers or for simply just being plain rude.  But, the ones you are talking about are the ones who get a thumbs down even when the answers are sound advice or even the right answer.  The reason for this, I believe is, just people who want to make someone feel bad because the person who gives the thumbs down never has the right answers.  Also someone giving a good answer a thumbs down because they just gave an answer and they are hoping that by giving a thumbs down to their opponent will better their chances of getting the vote.    I read all of the answers when I am interested in a topic and I thumbs up and down fairly.  I also read the ones with the most thumbs down and if it isn't deserving, I give it a thumbs up and also vote for that person hoping they will when the votes.    After this, I don't worry my self too much with them anymore because there are too many people who like to try to make others feel bad.  Just don't allow it to bother you and you will start to feel like the rest of us do.  Thumbs up or down really doesn't change the answer.  Good Luck. Now everyone give me the big thumbs down so I can get a good nights sleep|`|3TdT5mG2aa	THUMBS ME DOWN EVERYONE!!    Thumbs down feels great. It means that the world is sane!|`|jzex4ncSaa	bcuz stoopid answers always exist|`|JLayHNZCaa	It is all part of the game called YA.  A shame we can't thumbs down questions like it used to be.

I only give thumbs down to really long answers that take up the whole page (cuz it shrinks them so I can read others) or when they really are that bad. Usually I give thumbs up! But when I put down answers, especially answers I know are true (I am a nurse, so alot of my answers are fact, based on clinical experience, or common sense!) and I still get a bunch of thumbs down - even by people who put down almost the same exact thing!!! grrrrr....so annoying!!! I am glad someone acknowledges this besides me!!!  you have a great week too!!|`|HE3IkyL8aa	I would thumb down this question because I've asked it before.   LOL, I'm just kidding. I know what'll happen though, everyone will thumbs down everyone else's answer.

AA11368324	It was called, "The Arabian Knights".  It was about a prince whose kingdom had been overthrown by a bunch of desert thieves, and he and the princess joined up with a bunch of street berets to do good deeds as they tried to get the prince's kingdom back.  I don't remember the characters names, but I remember one was a wizard, one a circus strong man, and one had the power to turn into any animal he wanted ("Size of an elephant!"). And, of course there was their secret weapon, the donkey.  Don't you even think of pulling his tail.|`|tNdYtp2daa	That used to be the awesomest show! hahahaha|`|0hnh10jYaa	no i dont|`|iCFlGuBAaa	It was called The Arabian Knights.

Just to stay within your bounds, and easy 10.|`|hHQIUrNjaa	1-10, i'd say 9. I think lil wayne is a desecration to humankind, but he is definitely trying to get all audiences, even though that song just sucks ***.
tuATxHsVaa	Hmm I think Tchaikovsky wins this, personally.    His music is so full of palpable emotion and complexity. Strauss II tends to hit you over the head with melodies and big ideas. Their styles are totally different - I mean listen to my examples. The violin concerto pulls at your heartstrings. Strauss II's overture is an exuberant romp but it just doesn't have the lasting, haunting quality of the violin concerto by any means.    Your mileage may vary. Both of these compositions are fine indeed.    Tchaikovsky: Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 35    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFaq9kTlc...    Strauss:  Overture to "Die Fledermaus"     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YBhKx1bk...|`|KnNKekmQaa	strauss is great. His works are well-known pieces all over the world and easy to be enjoyed. However, I love Tchaikovsky more. He's very expressive in his works and he made Russian ballet alive! His are not just easy to be enjoyed, but also very vivid.    My favorite ones:  strauss: the feverfest polka (the well-known one)  thaikovsky: andante cantabille for cello and strings orchestra|`|CWejvYyuaa	I think both of them were great composers. My favorite would have to be Tchaikovsky, my favorite pieces are: The Nutcracker, 1812 overture. Although i do like Strauss the younger. He wrote The Blue Danube, which is also a great piece of music|`|jbAr62ybaa	I don't like either ones more than the other.  Must say that Tchaikovsky wrote more of the music I like than J. Strauss Jr.; but this doesn't mean that I like his music better - just that there's more to like.    J. Strauss Jr. favorite: http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=4YBhKx1bkE...    Tchaikovsky favorite: http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=mctpTyIBt_...                                                         Alberich|`|CrAwmz65aa	The Artists' Quadrille, op. 201 is a potpourri of compositions which were popular in Strauss' time.  Most of them are well-known today, but a few of them are not.    Writing a good medley is easier said than done.  I know because I've tried it.  I looked for a link, but I couldn't find one.  I think that piece deserves greater recognition.    The opening of Act II of Swan Lake has always been one of my favorite melodies.  That's the one which begins with an oboe solo in b minor.  (This time, I tried to post a link, but my computer wouldn't let me.  I don't know why.)    They played that piece in a movie which was shown in my junior high school music class.  I was glad the lights were out, because I wouldn't want my macho classmates to see my eyes watering.

If you dont then the tree will throw it back at you|`|zTfMdChTaa	i don't think it's possible for any plant to be allergic to water. unless it's not getting enough nutrients or sunlight. Give it water.   hamburgers? you would have to wait until the entire hamburger has gotten rotten, then it breaks down into microscopic piece which seems to be the only way it can be fed hamburgers which i think by then the tree will be dead. Your chioice. DoA ( it'll be dead or alive)|`|o34YHLiraa	Not in the strictest sense of food, no. They make their own food via photosynthesis, and water is very important to making that process go.    You might have overwatered your tree, but don't stop watering it altoghether. And also, it will not eat hamburgers or any other food you give it.|`|9HqgrhyUaa	They eat poop.|`|mFAzUh93aa	most trees are allergic to water. i feed mine goldfish. it's the only thing it'll eat|`|E9szvgGLaa	give it fertilizer, and no, they dont eat hamburgers|`|x4nnEal9aa	yeaa of course they do the more u feed them the bigger and fatter they will get|`|z3KqGlm8aa	uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

7fXpLlhBaa	I have got to say this is a great question. People that have not read the book "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"  by Roald Dahl will often say that they like the movie "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" starring Gene Wilder. Of course this movie is a classic and Gene Wilder is a genius in it, however, I prefer Tim Burton's version of the classic story is my favorite simply because it is much more alike to the book than the first movie was. It shares the same title, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", portrays the origination of the Oompa Loompas, and really gives it the edge that it requires. It was an odd movie yes, but so is the book. I mean, come on people! The whole idea is crazy and to call the movie weird and crazy is simply hypocritical. You've got to embrace the weirdness sometimes!|`|P2BjtJnUaa	Willy Wonka and...|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	I like the one where it ends with ME getting all the chocolate...|`|znLzOCHlaa	I like the newer one.|`|e81B9pDKaa	I lyke the old one.

3zSYBeTFaa	I don't know but get your fix by reading the books.  Author is Charlaine Harris.    all of her series are really good!
	That would depend on you.  They also announced at the same time that the entire series will be released later in 2009 (or at least the release date will be announced later in 2009).     So do you want to buy 4 episodes in March then get them repeated in the full season release later?  The special features might be different and (knowing Lucas) there might be edits to the episodes between the two releases.    My intention is to rent them from Netflix or something but hold off on purchasing until the full season is released.

hOH33uBnaa	Strings always go from the center of the head over the peg. The low & high strings wrap around the bottom pegs & the center strings wrap around the upper pegs.    Some people have a problem with this cuz of how they hang there toilet paper. Its true. Just remember from the center go over the peg & in the hole.    Happy playin'!|`|2HQe3MvXaa	Its really difficult to tell you what the problem is without actually seeing the guitar.  I would say just bring it to your local guitar shop, buy a pack of strings, and have them put them on for you.  The shop will most likely charge you for it, but just ask them to show you how...that way in the future it will work out better for you!
KBBonf97aa	If the problem isn't in the wiring, there might be a problem with one of the pots (the parts on which the volume and tone switches are mounted) -- probably the volume one.  The interior of a pot can get dirty over time and that can cause the volume to cut out intermittently.  Sometimes a good blast of compressed air will take care of the problem, but often a pot will need replacement.  If you have any soldering experience, you could replace it yourself.  Pots are available at most guitar stores and can be purchased at hundreds of places on the internet.  Stewart-Macdonald (stewmac.com) is a great place for quality replacement parts.  It could be the pickup selector switch, as well.  If there's a defect in that, you'll experience the same problem.  That switch is also easy to replace.  If you're not comfortable doing it yourself, most guitar stores have someone who'll be happy to do it for you.  It's an easy repair and shouldn't cost much at all.  I'd take the guitar to a different repair man and see if he can't run a few tests and determine the problem.  It sounds like it'll be something really minor, despite the frustration it's caused you.  Good luck!|`|o36YrSWRaa	It might need to have the soldering redone. Take it to a different guitar tech and get a second opinion.

lvBUl3Zdaa	They always do that. If women see female movie stars starting to be at normal, healthy weights, they might decide to be happy with their own bodies, instead of spending thousands of dollars on bogus diets that don't work, trying to do unhealthy things to change the color of their skin, spending thousands a year trying to change the hair their were born with, etc. Where would this country's fashion industry be if women cut their own hair and didn't throw out perfectly good wardrobes twice a year?|`|2rJwgk40aa	Hollywood is all about the image,and the media loves to pick celebs apart piece by piece.  I think she looks normal,she was too thin before.|`|NS5fnxpNaa	I don't know she looks great. I remember about a year or two they were talking about her having an eating disorder, she just cant win.

The media expects women in the public eye to be perfect, which is impossible.  I think the media can be quite awful.|`|xR9njr9Aaa	The media makes everything that a celebrity does into a big deal because some people are so sad that they think they will die if they don't hear gossip about a celebrity and the media get paid to bad mouth celebrities.  P.S. Don't believe anything that you hear from the media about celebrities 99% of it is crap.

gJhwH335aa	No, I don't want to loose all my memory of reading One Piece. HOWEVER, I don't mind re-reading the series over and over again. Why? Because there's always something new I'm going to find and discovered whenever I re-read the series (kinda like what happen to you when you discovered about Rayleigh) and make me goes "Wow! Oda is awesome!".    My point is, if I loose all the memory related to OP, I won't get a chance to be inspired and admiring Oda detailed plot twist and such.     By the way, I told you I will put some of the SBS Q's on my answer before right? Here's some of them    Volume 29    The Q's goes like this     "On Chapter 251, Usopp showed us the movement of Kamen Rider, are you a big fan of the series Oda-sensei?"  http://www.onemanga.com/One_Piece/251/05...    Oda answer    "When I was little, I used to read that manga, but the author already deceased! :("    Same volume    "I listened to a radio a while ago, the DJ said that in France, they used to have a pink snow there! Does Oda-sensei knew about this all along and later used it on your manga?"    (I don't know how to translate Oda answer properly because after Oda admitted that he knows about it all along, he kinda goes into scientific explanation for that Q's XD But here's some of his answer for that Q's)    "Sometimes, our dirty atmosphere can brings such an imaginary feeling don't you think?"    Some of the interesting Q's on Volume 30    The Q's is referred to this chapter    http://www.onemanga.com/One_Piece/253/04...    Oda explanation  http://img145.imageshack.us/img145/3707/...    "The third water needs to be boiled to produce heat. The heat is used to produce vapor on the first water. The drops of water that is formed by the vapor of the first water will then become the second water, which is the clean drinking water."    Make sense to you?    Another one    Pandaman's appearances are not limited to his actual appearance but also include his name as well. In the first panel in page 144 of Volume 22, on the Arabasta Poneglyph, his name can be seen written in Japanese.     http://www.onemanga.com/One_Piece/202/18...    This writing on the Poneglyph was noted by a fan and confirmed by Oda.  http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/6869/...    I can't put all of the Q's and A's here because some of them are just a random Q's Oda and his fan arguing about. Plus, it's kinda hard to translate Oda and his fan random Q's and A's ya know. :||`|GSpciJvMaa	Omg! Yes I would.  I've been wanting to lose all my memory and watch it all from the beginning again. I tried watching it all over, but failed because I know what is gonna happend and etc.    It's exciting, for me, to watch them all again since when you watch the first episode and on, you'd be like "Omg, they are gonna be so epic later on, it's amazing how much they've grown!" and stuff.     But the amount of episode is intimidating, however I won't mind it. C:|`|9qc3YoGIaa	Nope.    I don't care if I have to watch it over and over again, I will always enjoy One Piece in every episodes. I would even love to watch it till I get older and older... hahaha... I love One Piece!|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Hell no because I'm lazy to watch all of them over again.|`|btFSgJmlaa	Hell to the No.      Why?  It's too funny!|`|unVzWzCuaa	yes because that way i can start from scratch with my life and i could become a different person|`|szJSaZspaa	way 2 much episodes.|`|a62A3amuaa	No... I don't need to.

I have seen it in many mangas not just this one. I never really pay attention to the but i know they are there.    aerandria puts them out. To help get more help, it takes alot to translate all those mangas we hold dear to our heart.    its not from that manga, they used them for the ad its just an ad.|`|2loHOHhsaa	Honey Hunt|`|dsTVW1WTaa	Honey hunt.|`|3BX15PwBaa	Honey Hunt|`|FK0Lc696aa	You know, I remember someone asking this exact question about a year ago. I didn't know the answer then, and I certainly don't know it now.     It irks me how some things just don't change... -_-"    LOL!    Well, I really haven't a clue where those characters are from (even though I've seen that same page over and over and bloody over again), but I'm going to go out and assume that it is a series scanlated by Aerandria.     Sorry I couldn't be of more help.    -------------------------------------      ------------------------------------    Edit:    That is NOT from Honey Hunt. First off, I've read Honey Hunt. Secondly, that is NOT Miki Aihara's art style, not even from her earlier works.     All insert pages such as this are usually from a manga series. The scanlators just choose a page they want from any manga, and edits the page to suit what they need. There is a 95% chance that that is ACTUALLY a manga series. Only, it has been edited by the team to relay a message.

And with some things, I'm sure I am shallow.. But I try not to be. And I'm "deep" with most things, so.. whatever. Nobody's perfect.|`|JvZRoXY9aa	i am a deep person that acts shallow  i can't explain any better than that  even if i wanted to|`|F08qx2hgaa	Deep.    I see beyond the surface. My friends have talked to me about the weird way I consider things, and look beyond what I see.     I wouldn't have it any other way. I feel as if I CAN see some things that many do not. Yet I don't see this as making me above anyone else in this world. It can be sad and lonely, but... if I can use it to help people, and to figure the world out like I want to do, then I like it. ^-^    I also tend to lean towards music that has depth to it. Such as The Almost's, "Everything That Makes Me Sick". Though simplicity at its finest, perhaps Dave Matthews or a relaxing ballad? Necesary sometimes, to remind one that there's no harm in seeing some things as they are, on the surface. When it is right to do so. If it can be...|`|8airt9MLaa	Deep for sure haha, i write in a journal so that makes me feel like i am deep|`|z3KqGlm8aa	M

So yeah, you're pretty good.|`|o2epStcnaa	you are good :]|`|lKof1n0Xaa	You have a pleasant voice to listen to, I think when you find your own musical style and niche it will sound even better. Also as you get older your voice might deepen, and will probably get better. So I'd say that yes, you know how to sing, you have a nice voice but just work on your own personal style and what music means to you.   In other words, Taylor Swift sucks haha.|`|1s6mQJqOaa	WOW you have a great voice!!!|`|TEoTliSpaa	ur not too bad|`|plA56SWqaa	LMAO YOUR FACIAL EXPRESSION YOU MAKE THROUGH THE ENTIRE VIDEO IS HILARIOUS      but meh alright singing, not the best.. but not the worst|`|qcB23QvZaa	average..not bad but not amazingly good|`|xubpe9G5aa	that was great!  you have a very nice voice:)  keep singing!|`|tUxI10Teaa	ok, you've got natural talent, but you need to expand upon it with lessons if you really want to be "good"  i could make an entire list of things that would help your singing, but it would be pointless because you kinda need a visual to get the idea  but anyways, keep working at it|`|YdonwKlRaa	yeah, ur good!!       do you knowhow to sing mezzo soprano? if so, email me at chococat221@hotmail.com|`|pyC5kMA9aa	ur pretty good|`|5bWYjqO9aa	that was good!! i think u wud be great at singing faster songz but otherwise that was GREAT!!! much better that me!! :)|`|zb4tj2ZZaa	do you take voice lessons?|`|pOYsO3xzaa	wow that was awsome|`|VfW0Igc3aa	ur trying to sound country but your pretty good|`|3subGPvIaa	ya :)|`|DobKxnWBaa	it was pretty but some parts were a little off key|`|1Izur5YXaa	ur pretty good. the song showcases ur voice well, but its not my favorite song. also try singing some ashley tisdale songs (not from high school musical, but from her cd headstrong)|`|EaRkW5fXaa	Your voice is very pretty. It's nice but not like WOW. you know? I would definitely pursue some kind of voice lessons or something, just to perfect your already pretty voice. That wasn't a slam, you just have enough raw talent that lessons could really polish your voice|`|8AtZNUdHaa	yes you can ps i gave your vid 5 stars :)|`|mBNeacRtaa	Ur okay|`|AA12240690	Yea you have a very nice voice, I agree with "genie's" answer though.  You need to find the genre of music for YOUR voice. Very good thogh|`|Uo16H34Aaa	Well your a lot better than I am I only sing wen the sound goes louder than me lol But you have the voice and look you just need the next season of American Idol to come on lol

BwdYG7q6aa	I wish they would have normal people decide on the nominees not the totally stuck Hollywood elites that are currently on the Oscar nominee board. It seems like a every year the summer blockbusters get snub-ed, while movies about gay cowboys win all the awards|`|P8gGMlbIaa	Can some one remind me of a year that it didn't suck?    I don't watch it any more, why should I care what the Hollywood elitists give themselves a pat on the back for? Let them rot.|`|RJZQsBqbaa	I think they're gonna be great.  The movies up for it this year are all very good and deserve it.  The Dark Knight is not in there because it wasn't as good as the others.  And stop whining, it got 8 nominations.  I think its cool that a relatively small movie Slumdog Millionaire is getting recognized, and not just the mainstream movies.  Also, best actor is going to be very unpredictable, with Mickey Rourke and Sean Penn both very deserving nominees.  Props to the Academy, too, for giving Richard Jenkins a nomination for best actor.  The Visitor is a great movie and Richard is an often overlooked but very talented actor and its good to see him get his first nomination.|`|NF1sX416aa	It looks like they basically nominated the same movies in ever single category.   >Sigh|`|54yULzWRaa	I think this year's oscars will suck! I've seen most of the movies nominated, and i've only liked a few! Usually the oscar people don't pick the good nominees anyways...

Scare Tactics the t.v. pulled a prank on a guy once but he didn't know it was a trick and actually tackled one of their employees to the floor because he thought he was in danger.|`|LOpQsKysaa	because it's impractical to play a practical ( usually a physically embarrassing joke) on someone.  to do so the prankster must create doubt of mind or demean the person they trying to fool.   one definition of practical is as follows: mindful of the results, usefulness, advantages, or disadvantages, of an action or procedure.  most practical jokers, must make the recipient of their actions, the buffoon or butt of the joke.  otherwise there is no humorous payoff for them or the audience they are playing to.|`|AA11905223	usually the victim of a practical joke is embarrassed by the result and it can be detrimental to self-esteem.that is probably why, tho I don't necessarily agree with it.|`|tKb7i5jtaa	because some may not be obvious to others while most are saying that it was so easy.

3ee64ee7ec766828c5143beacd3dc7f6aa	My favorite is "Tarzan and His Mate", the direct sequel to Johnny Weismuller's first Tarzan appearance.

mAp5lrnSaa	Drinking hot tea correlates with singing better (because of hydrating and warming the throat), but green tea is not like some switch that suddenly makes someone a singing virtuoso.    Hot tea with honey in it coats the throat and helps with singing.  Sipping on hot slightly diluted apple cider vinegar with honey and lemon is supposed to be really good for the voice.  Vinegar has a lot of natural healing capabilities to it.  I don't do this myself because I can't stand to smell or taste vinegar, but I know this works from seeing others do it.    Hope I helped!  :D|`|0IjomiJ2aa	life savers are best....the sugar coats your throat|`|UEAdAuqbaa	Foods and drinks really have nothing to do with your singing voice.

AwrtwIpIaa	I think your plan will work.  Be sure to arrange them in a mostly vertically design so they will be visible past the curve of the Earth.  Remember to time your display a couple of hours before your sunset so the sun will provide the appropriate western backdrop.    For added convenience, plan the viewing angle so the balloons are visible from Interstate 35, which routes through Kansas.  To remember this occasion, leave your digital camera at home and snap a picture on 35 millimeter film.|`|dE5m2Krmaa	I know they have spinning, traveling houses in Kansas.....and they could probably be set to "green-seeking" like missiles are set to "heat-seeking".|`|DzIlM76Xaa	We should get Mr. Wizard on this ASAP.

It would have to be northern CA since KS isn't on the same latitude as the entire state.  Then you also have all sort of natural barriers such as mountains to contend with.|`|ecFd7gVdaa	350K is more than enough, I think    hmmm... I have a feeling that the birthday boy will spend the entire day tomorrow looking for green balloons.       Anything yet?

WqkOI7RDaa	Never gonna get finished.  Nickelodeon figured out that hiring the creative genius behind "Johnny the homicidal maniac" to do a childrens' show was a bad idea when hundreds of soccer moms called in and screamed their collective heads off about bad influences.  Nickelodeon then started telling Jhonen what he could and couldn't do with his show.  Jhonen, like all actual artists, does not do other people's art and quit.  The quitting was a long process but eventually ended in the show being cancelled. Other networks debated picking it up but frankly, it wouldn't be the same without Jhonen.   Also, the voice actors were starting to have problems due to all the screaming. Remember that each line is recorded 3/4 times, and that voice actors rely on their voices for income. They'd have to do recordings a few days apart so their throats could heal, and it was not working out for them either.|`|1hyUQ0dKaa	Apparently not. It was taken of the air, which really upset me! I believe a movie was made but the series was never finished. When it was obvious that Nickelodeon would drop the show due to disinterest from executives and lower ratings, the crew requested that Invader Zim be moved to MTV as The Ren and Stimpy Show and Rocko's Modern Life had been, but this didn't work out even after the show entered syndication. Before the second season was completed, Nickelodeon canceled the series completely, leaving at least seven episodes and a planned television movie series finale unfinished.|`|YIi7scHsaa	no

Some of the rumors were true and when Touji was hospitalized Sae forced Toji to break up with Momo. They soon got back together and later Sae tried to make their relationship complicated again by threatening to discredit Momo with her newly acquired access to the mass media. Though Toji was defiant to begin with, he reluctantly broke up with Momo in order to protect her. Momo was heartbroken at first, especially because she did not know that it was part of Sae's schemes. However, she eventually began dating Kairi, whom she had previously considered annoying, and soon began to fall in love with him.    When Toji reveals to Momo what had happened and why he breaks up with her, Momo is left to choose between Toji and Kairi. More problems arose and a love triangle was formed.    In "Sae's Story", Sae is left back a year, for she always was skipping classes. She is too stubborn so she goes to Momo's and Kairi's university every day. Toji goes to a good university by himself. Sae then meets one of her childhood sweethearts, Kanji (or Monkey Boy), who left for Malaysia when they were young, and promised to marry Sae when he was back. In love with Sae, Kanji follows her around, trying to win Sae back over. He also takes care of Sae's dog, Sora, when her parents would no longer let her keep it. The dog walks with a little limp, as one day when the dog tried to follow her, Sae threw a rock at its paw and injured her. Sae starts modeling and pretends she goes to college with Momo, when she is really still in high school. She meets Honda and works for CC as a model. She meets a guy named Takuma, but later he turned Sae down. Later, she meets another guy named Shinji but realizes he never really liked her. All these ups and downs makes Sae realize that Momo, Kairi, and Kanji are the only people that actually care for her      lol the last thing i pasted....|`|6s7TKWrBaa	PASTE|`|8nCbCQwTaa	paste|`|DvoP2aawaa	O est-ce quon mange bien en France?

I happen to like J holiday myself....he is a natural and you know beyonce is a triple threat...looks, talent, and awesome performer (she has so much stamina on stage, that it is amazing).  But they are still good artist out there with real talent like jennifer hudson, jazmine sullivan, fantasia, faith evans, angie stone musiq, joe, mark middleton (from blackstreet), anthony hamilton...you know the true musicians, if it wasn't for them I wouldn't even bother listening to the radio.|`|vp6fZZixaa	goodf|`|SAaEiqHvaa	i myself came into the rnb/hip-hop scene in the late 80's early 90's, and in the 90's i feel some of the best tunes came out, with great hooks and playful lyrics. as the genre has developed into whats now is urban music, i feel its all a little mixed up, money hungry and commercial. if a song like chicken noodle soup can get play time, then that proves that the game is setup by cash..    there is some great tracks that are coming out now since then and i always give cred where due, but i find im looking out side of these genres again to find the inspiration that moved me as did the 90's... songs like humpin around by bobby brown, sunday afternoon by lighter shade of brown, shes playin hard to get by hi five, my kind of girl by the rude boys, and the whole album of black sunday and doggy style...    but thats my thoughts..|`|MkfbtQhpaa	yeah it isnt the same anymore..i miss all the 1990's music..it was all about loveee      my fav male singer is-chris brown,& trey songz    fav female- is Rihanna & Beyonce..|`|eNR2iot8aa	There are just not that many r&b artist as there used to be.

6LIBZ3nLaa	If I have to deal strictly with composers from the Classical period, I would say Haydn. Did a vast majority of works with a hint of humour and personality in each one (especially his Symphony 45 [at least I think it's 45], the Farewell Symphony.)    Otherwise, it would have to be Rachmaninoff- as you said, thunderous and massive, as well as loud and proud. It makes it all the better since I have big hands.|`|Tnnwniy7aa	I love Chopin, he's the master of poetry on the piano, but I also like how Beethoven is really aggressive and how Mozart is really comedic, but right now, my favorites are Bela Bartok, Debussy (LOVE HIM), and Bach (who gave me "two-minded-technique").|`|jbAr62ybaa	"Thunderous and massive", huh?  Richard Wagner is my favorite.           "Entrance of the Gods into Valhalla" from his "Das Rheingold(ignore the stupid video, and just listen to the music):    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=yDcAlCsTr1...         Most will recognize this most popular of all the excerpts from his operas:    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=GSKL5E3zSj...         And one of my most favorite pieces from his operas, the "Liebestod" from "Tristan und Isolde"(without the vocal line):    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=K2qh2QRWIT...                                                            Alberich|`|x2OgEVt3aa	My favorites are always changing. Today, it's Vivaldi and Evard Greig.|`|Kaudz4Msaa	Umm...hello...is there another....  BRAHMS???|`|WV4YlqYzaa	^^|`|tuATxHsVaa	W. A. Mozart. L. van Beethoven. Haydn. Schubert. Vivaldi. Tchaikovsky.... and it keeps going. Dvorak, Brahms, Ravel, Stravinsky, etc. etc. etc. etc.    It's hard to rank the masters. They are all masters.    Mozart and Beethoven are my favorites.|`|KnNKekmQaa	I love haydn for his marvelous works with a great of "cheerful" personality in his pieces.  mozart for his genius works.  beethoven for his inspirational pieces.  tchaikovsky for his ballet & expressive works.  bernstein for the vivid broadway songs.
A9Mt3u4Qaa	Yes it is very funny.  I have heard it many times before but I always laugh at it.  That is the mark of real comedy - something that stays funny even after you have heard it many times.

mAp5lrnSaa	No, you do not have to be born with a singing voice to become a professional singer.  You will have to work hard and practice many many hours to become a professional, but if your passion is there...you can do it!    I didn't start voice lessons until I came to college for my Music Education degree.  Find a good teacher that will teach you good technique and help you find your most comfortable voice range.    Here's some tips to help keep your voice at top notch:  drink plenty of water (have it with you at all times), cut your use of caffeine (cut it out is even better), don't take medicine unless you have to (it will dry you out), do vocal warmups (slow "yawn-sighs"/"sirens" are so helpful) for at least 10-15 minutes before you start singing a song (I stress the importance of this), and so much more.  I don't want to make this into a huge wall of text.  :-)    If you're really interested in learning more, I have a HUGE Powerpoint presentation from one of the voice faculty here at my college that I would be happy to send to you by e-mail.  Hope I helped.  :-)|`|6ybAFZuAaa	no. ever heard of ozzy osbourne? lol|`|WJcH24xCaa	You can become a good singer from any age if you are dedicated and put lots of time and effort into it.  Voice lessons will really help to get to know how your voice works and get some techniques under your belt.  So, practice, practice, practice! :-) And remember to have fun because if it's not fun it's not worth doing.  Good Luck!|`|FIymMqm9aa	Of course you can.  If you put enough effort into it and take time to learn and practice singing, you will be able to get a lot better.  You are at a disadvantage since you're already almost 16, but you'll still be able to if you put enough effort into it.|`|YKMu1jJ8aa	yep, anything is possible, right ^-^ and no you dont have to be born with a singing voice because if u want to be good u just have to practice unless of course you tone deaf o.o lol

GgB6bLhTaa	The only way you can truly understand what is going on in Lost is to read Stephen King's the Dark Tower series.  All things lead to the Dark Tower and the Crimson King.  Rolan will show you the way, if you follow him.  Start with the Gunslinger and soon you will have all the answers.|`|py0DpCh4aa	I think world war II was going on during the year Richard mentioned - is that what is happening there?   I don't know maybe?    Is that girl going to die?   IDK, I have a feeling she's pregnant and we all know what happens to pregnant women on the island.....    but can any of them actually die if it is like way before they were even born?   I don't know!      Is Charlie from the island Desmond's son?   Wow, OMGGGGGGG, I assumed that charlie was named after charlie for some reason or another because, Penny said earlier they had been off the island 3 years...    or is Desmond in the future (present time) - why isn't Davids work   there?  I assumed desmond was in the "future"/present time      Why does Penny's dad want the people on the island dead?   I DUNNO    and why was Desmond put there in the first place?  I dunno     Why is Charles Whitmore on island as a young man?   Who knows!?|`|40qrABWsaa	World War 2 was in the forties people!!   and Please watch the previous seasons of Lost.     Also that time travel thing is throwing you for a loop kid, CALM DOWN, Relax and just watch all questions will be answered in time.|`|U8aXa8xEaa	Desmond's son is NOT Charlie Pace.  His name would have been Charlie Hume.  Charlie Pace has an older brother named Liam.  Desmond's son was just named after Charlie.    Who is David?  Did you mean Daniel?    The questions about Charles Widmore have not been answered yet.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	Tonite they were in 1954. Back then H-bomb testing was the craze. The "others" killed the 1954 soilders and are protecting the island. It's 1954 so Richard doesn't know about Locke because he isn't born yet. Now it makes since why Richard shows up at Lockes birth and shows up at his foster moms house and gets pissed when he doesn't pick the compass, but the knife.    I think Faraday was trying to help Charlotte out when he said he loved her because she needs a constant to keep from dying. Faraday wasn't Charlotte's constant...so she might kick the bucket.    I think the baby Charlie is just adult Charlie's namesake. Des and Charlie were close...it was nice to name his kid after him.    The island has powerful powers. Possibly the fountain of youth, healing properties, time travel...all that equals money. Widmore is greedy if he can get his hands on the island he'd be a rich man.     Charles is an "other'' so he was on the isand in '54 and possibly before that.

37evQRaDaa	You have what is commonly referred to as a banjolele.  I've never heard the term Banjuke before, but that's a pretty cool term.  I have one i built from a cookie can which i call a canjolele.  (you can see pictures here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/resistzine/...     As you've already figured out, it's a cross between a banjo and a ukulele.  Although you've had some difficulty finding the exact same model as the one you have, they're just different versions of the same instrument.  Yours has the (drum) head and a resonator back.  Some have an open back like this one: http://www.flickr.com/photos/63092108@N0...  This one seems similar to yours in that it has a resonator back with an open ring around the head, however on this one the head is tightened from the back.  From the video yours appears to tighten from the front. http://www.pamelasmusic.co.uk/images/For...   &  http://www.deuceofclubs.com/tunes/ukes/m...   Here's one that seems to more closely resemble your instrument, but it's a mandolin banjo: http://www.pamelasmusic.co.uk/images/For...  (there are more banjolele's here: http://www.pamelasmusic.co.uk/ukes.htm)    I can't help you with the age of your banjo, but good luck with your search for information|`|LGkbTVB6aa	That is a BanJuke, There Very Rare, Your GrandDaddy Had it Right As Far as Tuning it And stuff Goes, Its Very Hard to Find Very much info on Them, I Called down To My Uncle and asked him about them Because I Was Curious Lol.... but my uncle Called it a Ban Uke not Juke, Im not sure exactly On That BUT i Did Google (( Yes i love google)) Ban Uke And found some pretty Cool Sites on it, Like http://spankyukes.com/ Had the Most Information on Them, So. Yeah, My Uncle Was pretty Interested in your though, So, Yeah, Anyways, There Like a 4 string banjo Basically, But Were Really Popular With My Granddaddy and Great Granddaddy, So Yeah, Thats All the info I have though,.        p.s    Your Kinda Cute if thats You In The Video,|`|Zj8JkvX1aa	Best I could do. Hope you find it.    http://www.folk-banjo.com/instruments/ov...    is this it?  http://freespace.virgin.net/dennis.taylo...|`|02e63c48e93d80477718d0f4cefee8deaa	From my research, I have concluded that this instrument is very literally called "Banjo-Ukulele." The reason that someone told you "Banjuke" is probably that they thought it sounded cooler.

Then, this big trouble-making truck driver steps next to him, takes the drink from the guy, and just drinks it all down. The poor man starts crying. The truck driver says, "Come on man, I was just joking. Here, I'll buy you another drink. I just can't stand to see a man cry."    "No, it's not that. This day is the worst of my life. First, I fall asleep, and I go late to my office. My boss, outrageous, fires me. When I leave the building, to my car, I found out it was stolen. The police said that they can do nothing. I get a cab to return home, and when I leave it, I remember I left my wallet and credit cards there. The cab driver just drives away."    "I go home, and when I get there, I find my wife in bed with the gardener. I leave home, and come to this bar. And just when I was thinking about putting an end to my life, you show up and drink my poison."|`|a8a441aa6973c0e73348e618806e0c1faa	A man walks into a bar what does he say?  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

Someone had given me a little tea set as a get-well gift and it was one of my favorite toys.    Daddy was in the living room engrossed in the evening news when I brought Daddy a little cup of tea, which was just water. After several cups of tea and lots of praise for such yummy tea, my Mom came home.    My Dad made her wait in the living room to watch me bring him a cup of tea, because it was just the cutest thing! My Mom waited, and sure enough, here I come down the hall with a cup of tea for Daddy and she watches him drink it up.    Then she says, (as only a mother would know..      Did it ever occur to you that the only place she can reach to get water is the toilet?|`|Yyt8ZjU2aa	Random jokes I heard over the years:      My wife and I were sitting at a table at my high school reunion, and I kept staring at a drunken lady swigging her drink as she sat alone at a nearby table.      My wife asked, 'Do you know her?'      'Yes,' I sighed, 'She's my old girlfriend. I understand she took to drinking right after we split up those many years ago, and I hear she hasn't been sober since.'      'My Goodness!' says my wife, 'who would think a person could go on celebrating for that long?'     _________________    My wife was hinting about what she wanted for our upcoming anniversary.      She said, 'I want something shiny that goes from 0 to 200 in about 3   seconds.'      So I bought her a scale.

xwUY2b8Jaa	Wrong category, but radioactive isotopes have half lives. The amount of a certain isotope in the lava should tell you how old it is (same principle as carbon dating).|`|4ObhfxoIaa	Isn't it you can't?  Wouldn't the sedimentary rocks melt from the lava?      But wrong section :D|`|AA12257580	Nice pun! Rock music, rock dating technique...    Radioactive dating techniques employ the idea that certain radioactive isotopes decay at a certain rate and that this rate has been constant throughout history. Using estimations as to what the initial amount was, scientists can extrapolate how old the rock was based on the decay rate and the initial amount. Scientists have calculated the "half life" of certain isotopes. The half life indicates that after a certain period of time, only half of the isotope will remain (that is, the rest will have decayed).    Carbon-14 dating is only valid for a time span of about 50,000 years. For longer time periods (such as those when dating rocks), Potassium-Argon dating is much more useful.|`|r1UQZTjraa	LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL    ..youre funny x)|`|h9lPQCOVaa	wrong category. lol...

RsenWiWfaa	Well, it instigated an entire genre of genres, but electronic music aside, it really reduced the caliber of many pop artists. They look better than they sing, and while I like some vocoder (I actually don't mind T-Pain, and I love the Daft Punk stuff), I really don't like artists who use them to try and sound organic.    Scratch that: I was just watching VH1 classic. The 80s saw some REALLY bad music.    And, though a lot of modern Pop names don't really have all that much talent, the people making their tracks do. Whoever makes the background stuff for Rhianna and Britney's pretty good; I guess electronics have allowed those kind of people to remain anonymous.
AalRni7raa	My favorite actor is Edward Norton. I believe his best performance was in American History X. I believe that good acting is the ability to make the audience go through different emotions.|`|RJZQsBqbaa	Simply put - if you forget the actor is acting, then it is good acting.  You need to feel like the actor is not someone trying to be someone else, but they are that person.  I feel that this actually makes it more difficult for big time actors to stand out, because they are so easily recognizable.  Some of my favorite performances are Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York, Emile Hersch in Into the Wild, Forest Whittaker in The Last King of Scotland, Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Liam Neeson in Schindler's List, and De Niro in Taxi Driver.|`|WchfVMsPaa	Meryl Streep because of her body of work. She can make you laugh, cry, and loathe her character. I like her because of her diversity. I also like Christian Bale because I feel he becomes the character he plays. It could have also to do with media exposure. Really famous actors whom are known more for their exploits outside of film sometimes make it harder to see them in their roles if that makes sense.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	I really like old movies, Norma Shearer was a great actress, maybe because she started in silent films(which I don't like) but she could communicate so much with her expressions. You could feel the pain she felt just by the look on her face and her body language and it looked effortless and natural. I feel the same way about Bette Davis and several other "old timers" I do not have a favorite actor or actress in today's film industry. They just don't compare.|`|41dbd5f49217df2a78323631830fd261aa	I like actors who take me somewhere, like i've actually met the character and experienced their personality and presence. There also needs to be some wow factor about their performance and some emotional impact. It's about embracing the character, making the character your own, but also making you become the character. These performances require subtlety and nuance about various mannerisms which appear natural.    Daniel Day Lewis in "There will be Blood"  Marion Cotillard "Vie en rose, La"  Bruno Ganz in "Downfall" or "Der Untergang"  Leonardo di Caprio in "Blood Diamond" and "Revolutionary Road"  Kate Winslet in "Revolutionary Road" and possibly "Eternal Sunshine"  Hugh Jackman / Christian Bale in "The Prestige"  Heath Ledger in "Dark Knight"  Brad Pitt in "The Assassination of Jesse James"    I could think of some more but these are really stand-out performances for me.|`|279ac5587c0a982b23b03bde3f0bbf91aa	I worked as a professional actor/mime/comedian for almost 30 years now. I still perform and teach but not on a regular basis or for income. I now am an artist/author/teacher   What makes a good actor or performer   PASSION!  without passion you are flat, boring. even if your technique is good without passion you have nothing, not in acting or life.      Believability- people want to escape into acting. They want to experience life outside themselves. You could be playing the part of a bug (Metamorphosis ) and I want to see you act like one. I want to see you feel like one. I want you to suspend my disbelief to the point I believe you are one.     Projection. If I can't hear you or see you I will ignore you. When playing the stage your voice and body has to project to the furthest person in the audience.     Confidence. We want to see you act with confidence that you know what you are doing even if someone else screws up a line you know you character so well that you would know how to improve.     I hope this is helpful.

Just look at the lyrics:    "Thunderbolt of lightning, very very frighting!"    I think Galileo is mentioned? Mama mia mama mia mama mia let me go!    and Beelzebub is in there, too. Ridiculous.

8YAVjRWoaa	Well if your asking for an honest opinion I would say that they would definitely comment on your appearance and the way you present your self.   Also you seemed VERY nervous throughout the whole song, being confident will definitely make you seem more like an idol.  Your voice is good but I think that if you weren't AS nervous you would have sounded really, really good.    A song that I would recommend you sing would be breakaway by Kelly Clarkson, the tone of your voice is different and will bring uniqueness to the song as well I think you would be able to sing the song perfectly.  Good luck and hope you make it!  :)|`|RoXHFR3zaa	You are a good singer... but I don't think you'd make it on American Idol.

Go with Central or Peidmont Park. Folsom isn't good at all. The songs are decent, but the editing and filming are awful, way too much footage of the crowd and some really dumb editing choices.

His grades aren't very good because he fights more than he studies, but he tends to protect the weaker students from bullies. A few classmates idolize him; one (Midori Kasugano from a different school) shyly loves him from afar; but most are just afraid of him, which has made it impossible for him to find a girlfrienduntil one morning when he wakes to find a miniature Midori attached to where his right hand used to be.  Over the next two weeks the pair adapt to this sudden and forced closeness. Much mayhem, and some romance, ensue. Seiji does his best to hide Midori from other people; she wears a bandage around her head and pretends to be his injured hand. Midori frequently professes her love to Seiji (even wearing a dress she made and embroidered with "I ? Seiji"), but Seiji fails to notice, even as he frequently laments that he'll never find a girl who loves him.    ?-Ergo Proxy:  The story begins in a futuristic domed city called Romdo,[1] built to protect its citizens after a global ecological disaster. In this utopia, humans and androids (AutoReivs[1]) coexist with each other peacefully under a total management system. A series of murders committed by berserk robots infected with the Cogito virus begins to jeopardize the delicate balance of the social order. Behind the scenes, the government is conducting secret experiments on a mysterious humanoid lifeform called Proxy, which is believed to hold the key to the survival of mankind.    ?-Gasaraki:n the near-future of Gasaraki, technological advances in Japan have made bipedal, armored mecha-suits newly viable as weapons. Yushiro Gowa, scion of the rich and powerful family who spearheaded the Tactical Armor project, is one of the most talented first-generation TA pilots. He's also the puppet of a shadow group that wants to use his exceptional physiological talents in a strange experiment. Eight years ago, a previous experiment involving a traditional dance called the Gasara caused a spatial and gravitational distortion, apparently opening a singularity that served as a portal to another place. Yushiro's manipulators are determined to repeat this experiment and open communication with something on the other side. Their first attempt is partially successful, but as the portal begins to open, Yushiro makes psychic contact with a woman who mentally attacks him and who is then pulled out of their link, shouting "You've got to stop! Don't bring it back--the terror!" Gowa breaks off the dance, choosing not to explain his reasons, and begins to nurse a quiet obsession about the woman from his vision.    ?-Cowboy Bebop:  The opening episodes of Cowboy Bebop introduce bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black in a breathless rush that leaves little time for details or backstory. As the series continues, little more is apparent about them except that they're suave, skilled, secretive--even with each other--and they have the worst luck in the universe when it comes to actually nabbing their targets. Spike and Jet almost never get their man. (Or woman. Or interplanetary terrorist group.) Instead, they often get stuck with some sort of McGuffin that brings instant violence down on their heads, or saddles them with a moral responsibility for someone in a messy jam, or both.    ?-Silent Mobius:  In 1999, a mysterious cataclysm known as the Silent Crisis made 90 percent of Earth's surface unfit for human habitation. The survivors of the catastrophe crowded into the remaining areas, which became densely overcrowded, crime-ridden dystopias haunted by interdimensional invaders known as Lucifer Hawks. These giant biomechanical monsters come in several varieties--the silent, animalistic "Type Threes," the more intelligent "Type Twos" and the mysterious, sophisticated "Type Ones."

I loved it and i hope you will to! :)    Peach Girl is a high school drama centered on Momo Adachi. A former member of the swim team, Momo tans easily and her hair is bleached out; unfortunately, she is stereotyped by her ignorant classmates, and is forced to endure rumors about being a playgirl. Her only friend is Sae, who is actually responsible for spreading the nasty gossip due to her jealousy to Momo. Momo is in love with Toji, a taciturn baseball player, but the scheming Sae also has her eye on the boy. Momo's life is further complicated with the introduction of Kairi Okayasu, a wise-cracking playboy who is determined to make her his because she had saved him from drowning the summer before high school started.    Things became even more complicated when Sae, in an attempt to make Momo miserable, spread rumors about Momo and Kairi making out. Some of the rumors were true and when Touji was hospitalized Sae forced Toji to break up with Momo. They soon got back together and later Sae tried to make their relationship complicated again by threatening to discredit Momo with her newly acquired access to the mass media. Though Toji was defiant to begin with, he reluctantly broke up with Momo in order to protect her. Momo was heartbroken at first, especially because she did not know that it was part of Sae's schemes. However, she eventually began dating Kairi, whom she had previously considered annoying, and soon began to fall in love with him.    When Toji reveals to Momo what had happened and why he breaks up with her, Momo is left to choose between Toji and Kairi. More problems arose and a love triangle was formed.    In "Sae's Story", Sae is left back a year, for she always was skipping classes. She is too stubborn so she goes to Momo's and Kairi's university every day. Toji goes to a good university by himself. Sae then meets one of her childhood sweethearts, Kanji (or Monkey Boy), who left for Malaysia when they were young, and promised to marry Sae when he was back. In love with Sae, Kanji follows her around, trying to win Sae back over. He also takes care of Sae's dog, Sora, when her parents would no longer let her keep it. The dog walks with a little limp, as one day when the dog tried to follow her, Sae threw a rock at its paw and injured her. Sae starts modeling and pretends she goes to college with Momo, when she is really still in high school. She meets Honda and works for CC as a model. She meets a guy named Takuma, but later he turned Sae down. Later, she meets another guy named Shinji but realizes he never really liked her. All these ups and downs makes Sae realize that Momo, Kairi, and Kanji are the only people that actually care for her|`|tYiMSItraa	Sir/Ma'm I direct you to the below image.

The ones I knew were both attractive, one I had a crush on and the other was just a good friend.    They were both sensitive people but they try to hide it sometimes. They love to talk and be the center of attention. And they loooooove fun.    I really liked the one friend, Chris though. He was very sweet, and somewhat of a show off. He worked out sometimes and knew he was attractive, but one day he asked me if he looked good, and I was like, "Yeah."    It was so random, yet funny.    I don't know what else to say though. The friend that was also attractive but I didn't feel much for at all was very sweet also. He never seemed to lose his temper EVER and was always laughing. He was gay like me. We got along swell.    A female friend that I used to chill with came on kinda strong because she liked me and I didn't feel the same, but she, also, was a sweetheart.    I got along with them all very well.

They are also known to not be happy with just one relationship so I'm not to sure how faithful they would be in a relationship.    I wish you all the best.|`|3YdDpReTaa	About sagittarius's in general:    Restless, cheerful, and friendly, Sun in Sagittarius people are generally on the go. They have a love of freedom, and a disdain for routine. Generally quite easygoing, Sagittarians make friends with people from all walks of life. They love to laugh and tease, and get along well with both sexes.     Sagittarians have an often blind faith in people, and in the world. Their optimism is infectious, although it can get them into trouble from time to time. These are curious people who love to learn. Their idealistic nature is hard to miss.    Although generally easygoing, Sagittarius is a fire sign. This gives natives a generally quick temper. Fortunately, they're usually as quick to forget what got them angry in the first place.    The need for escape is generally strong, and some Solar Sagittarians come across as a little irresponsible. They're generally easy to forgive, however. After all, their direct, honest approach in life is admirable.

Those are the ones that become stalkers or go at least have a real hard time letting go. They tend to get COMPLETELY clouded in denial.     They make good friends though, I've just seen those same friends pull the psycho girlfriend act on their boyfriends more than any of my friends with other signs.
9564ae87b0958092aa7cbd48f13f7a24aa	Well, if you guys share same common interests, why not do something sporty or something after school, with another friend of yours and another friend of his, go indoor skating or something - hang out at the mall. To know him better you have to see how he is like outside of school. The best way to do this, is ask when he is free. Don't say things like, 'hey do you wanna go out tonight?' Otherwise he may not be approachable. Schedule something to do at a very small group hangout, so that you could sort of 'test' a scenario with him - like how he acts in comparison to you and your friend.  This will give you an idea if he is still interested. If he's not, get to know what he likes, find out, for one, if he is really worth it (there are many hot, smart and cool, but they are all different), and walk his way. I mean, if he likes Italian food, then impress him by making an Italian dish (romantic! XD).  Catch my drift?  Hope I helped, good luck!|`|9B6Om8oDaa	Suggest you should get a full horoscope check and not go by just sun sign. That will explain how compatible you are.

U8aXa8xEaa	No, "The Other Woman"  still holds the title. This one wasn't bad at all.  But I love all this shows episodes.   At least this one gave us a few more clues.      1.  Charles Widmore was on the Island in 1954.   2.  Daniel Faraday's mother is in Los Angeles.  So chances are good that Ms. Hawking  (the white haired woman talking to Ben at the end of last weeks episode)  is Daniel's mother.     This isn't really a clue, but I love the fact that Desmond's son was named after Charlie.|`|4JQUUrX1aa	yeah the people got a point.. the diamond thieves episode.. think it was in the first or second season.. was sooooooo awful. they used clips from old episodes to formulate the whole story line in such a way that it seemed cheap and useless.    this episode tonight though really really sucked! and the reason for this is simple.. last week was sooo awesome .. that this one was a super let down. first of all penny sucks.. i just dont care about her at all.. period. the girl holding the gun... like what is the point of her.. other than to hold a gun and talk crap... anyone couldve replaced her. old whidmore.. oooh soo scary.. he just voluntarily helped out desmond without much of a fight. all this garbage of the old crew of the others.. seems a bit recycled.. like its been thru the laundry a few times.. and set on dry for a long time.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	No, it was pretty good.

So much happened.  It answered a lot of things without actually saying it.    Charles widmore was a hostile/other    The jughead a-bomb is the "accident" from the first hatch    Ms hawking is faraday's mother    Richard hasn't been time traveling, he's just really old    The only reason Locke is even on the island is because he told richard when and where he will be born. Then richard will see Locke in the delivery room, know that he's right about time traveling and being the new leader of the others, and richard will continue to follow up with Locke as he grows up.    Man, this might be the best episode yet.|`|5NJbpdUpaa	No!  Not at all!!  We got to find out a lot of things and one big thing!  Charles Whitmore was one of the "Others"

Its actually not a 'horror' show, but is incredibly funny is a semi-bawdy way ... my sons both saw it before they turned 12 and think it's a 'great show' but not one they want to go back to more than twice a year!

I'm 19 none but i can remember watching that movie years ago. Its quite funny actually from what I can remember but like i said its been awhile.

While in its day it may be seen as provacative (okay maybe it still is) is not like the movies like good luck chuck where its basically porn.  Rocky horror picture show is a form of Artistic expression that is a pure pleasure to watch there is some nudity but you can barely see it and nothing she hasnt seen before. One of my fav movies, I was 2 when I first saw this movie.|`|aaGaMsJQaa	It's a cheesy movie from the 70s that has a lot of underlying humor and sexual innuendos that a 14 year old won't understand. There are transsexuals, gays, murders and lots of bad singing. If you watch it on video or dvd, you will probably think it is the worst movie you ever saw. The only way to experience it is in a theatre where the audience acts it out and yells back at the screen (I don't even know if they still do that - they used to have midnight showings). I wouldn't recommend taking a 14 year old to that though because most people are drunk and/or high. I guess that's what makes it watchable.  Hurt.  - The Skidmark Kid|`|RsenWiWfaa	It'll be awkward if u watch it with her, but I think its fine.

SEX AND NUDITY - A woman's breasts briefly pop out of her bustier twice though this is edited out in some versions. The statues in the laboratory are of naked men ala "David." There is an implied orgy in a swimming pool during the "Floor Show" scene.Janet and Brad are seduced by Dr. Franknfurter, and Frank asks if they'd like Brad (with Janet) or Janet (Brad) to see them like "this" (legs above their heads). In Brad's scene, Frank even starts to perform something on Brad before Riff-Raff calls him to come get Rocky. This is all behind a shadowed screen though. After this scene, Janet proceeds to want more after her encounter with Dr. Franknfurter, and has a sexual encounter with Rocky, which leads into the song, "Touch-A, Touch-A, Touch-A Me."     VIOLENCE - Some off screen gore as a man is chopped up with a pickax. Some onscreen gore when his body is revealed later. A woman is slapped. Three people are shot with a ray gun but with no blood.    LANGUAGE - One use of the "f-word", one of the songs "Dammit Janet" contains several uses of the titular word|`|54yULzWRaa	That movie is kind of a joke, so i think that movie will be fine for her.
y8WBcehmaa	The reason the original movie was called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory is because Raold Dahl did not like the direction they were taking with the movie and he refused to allow them to call it Charlie and the Chocolate Factory    Tim Burton's remake was much truer to the original book "Charlie and the Chocolate factory" and it received the blessing from Raold Dahl's widow to call it Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.    that is the difference.|`|MpYIFWe7aa	yeah it comes from the book...but of course the title are different,,also the year....the new one is a remake actually...and they just change the title to have difference,,but if you'll see....there's really no difference...|`|816YM1vbaa	Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory was the original movie. and Charlie and the chocolate factory was the crap remake.

py0DpCh4aa	John locke & his group travelled through time on the island.    We find out Charles Whitmore used to be on the island in 1954.  (locke was born in 56)    Desmond goes to Oxford university to find Farday's mother & - has to go to charles whitmore for the information.   Farday's mother is living in LA.  (i suspect she is the woman ben was talking to at the end of last weeks epi)    There is some kinda bomb on the Island.    The white british woman fell over with a bad nosebleed.|`|1y1c5QWHaa	John Locke and them travelled to 1954, (& we discovered John Locke was born in 1956).  While John Locke was talking to Richard, we found out that Charles Whitmore was one of the 'Others'.  Desmond went to Oxford to find Daniel Faraday's mother; he went to Charles Whitmore, who gave him an address in Los Angeles.  Desmond and Penny had a son a few years before, who they named Charlie.  During 1954, Daniel Faraday was attempted to disarm a hydrogen bomb, but was whisked away to another time before he could.  Right after they went to another time, the British woman with orange-ish red hair got a really bad nosebleed, and passed out.    My theory is, the woman who Ben was talking to, who is the woman who Desmond saw when he was seeing Charlie dying, is Daniel Faraday's mother. It's just a theory I have, though.    -??T? ???? ???T? ???!!!

tuATxHsVaa	Dr. Thomastik's Dominants are certainly not "cheap" strings. The price difference between Obligatos and Dominants is ridiculously small. Calling Dominants "cheap" and Obligatos "great" is a hilarious laugh. They are both of very good quality and many professionals use them both.     The Sensicore strings that you mentioned are Super-Sensitive's version of Dominants. They are NOT a knockoff gut string at all. They are a synthetic core string. They have a perlon core just like Dominants and the sound and feel is similar.     Also, using a medium or light gauge E string (with medium gauge G, D, and A strings) is not often recommended by fine luthiers. It has to do with tension being even across the bridge.    I substitute the Dominant E string with a Jarger Forte E. Don't bother with the E string that comes with the Dominant set.     Obligatos have a very lovely sound and come closest to sounding like gut, but they are not ideal for concerto/solo work as they do not project all that well.    Every violin responds differently to certain strings.     Here are some evaluations of strings:    http://www.violinist.com/wiki/violin-str...    and another, similar page...    http://www.stringsmagazine.com/issues/St...    The first thing to do when evaluating strings is to figure out whether your violin is more "bright" or "dark" in sound. Evah Pirazzi strings tend to work well on brighter instruments, for instance.    Dominants will be a very safe bet. It's obvious that I recommend trying them out first. You will probably love the sound of Obligatos, too. Just remember that every violin reacts differently. My violin loves Dominants and doesn't sound nearly as sweet with Obligatos - but I have played other instruments where Obligatos sound extraordinarily lovely.    And don't forget that all strings have a break-in period. Dominants tend to sound rather metallic for the first few days.|`|Kaudz4Msaa	You may want "soft" strings for the higher strings.    Gut and silver will give you a softer tone.    I am not familiar with sensicore, but it sounds like it's a knockoff of gut, so probably, it will sound reasonably okay.    Chrome-steel are the cheapest, worst-sounding strings...don't get those.|`|fwX34fFtaa	I use pirastro obligatos, and they're great. they're like 70$ though, you probably don't want to spring for them if you don't need a great set.  dominants are the standard because they're fairly cheap and have a decent sound.  I never found anything wrong with the E string but then again I haven't used dominants in several years so I wouldn't remember anyway.  I'd say, get dominant GDA and a different E just to be safe.  However if you can go into a shop and try out the strings, that's the best way to do it because all violins are different and sound best with different strings.

Lennon composed the avant-garde song by combining three songs he had been working on. When he learned that a teacher at his old primary school was having his students analyze Beatles' lyrics, he added a verse of nonsense words.[3]  The walrus is a reference to the walrus in Lewis Carroll's "The Walrus and the Carpenter" (from the book Through the Looking-Glass). Lennon expressed dismay upon learning that the walrus was the villain in the poem.|`|bHasK8n5aa	John Lennon! the genius! but obviously its a lennon and mccartney song!

8yE2sYGeaa	Rated PG-13 for some violence and a scene of sensuality.     I would personally pass and play it safe|`|0yGuaZ6raa	Take her. A little light desensitization never goes astray. If you keep them innocent as children, they grow up to be weak as adults.|`|8MVrUtbAaa	Oh my! Twilight is the best movie ever! I loved it, and it's completely appropriate! She will love it, and there's no cursing, and she will not have nightmares. The only side effect that may occur is a major crush on the main character, Edward! :) Take her! It's a wonderful movie :)|`|W1lh6A8saa	Twilight is rated pg-13 for violence and a scene of sensuality. I saw it and I would say that it's a little violent, but there isn't much blood. There is a scene though were two of the main characters start making out.  I think a twelve year old would be able to handle it, but if you don't feel comfortable taking her, then don't do it. It totally depends on what you think is best for her.|`|nqMAUOwsaa	Twilight is a movie based on the Twilight Saga written by Stephenie Meyer.  It's a teen series about love and the anguish of being with the one you love despite the fact that they are complete opposites.      There is no gore, no real violence and no fornicating.  There is a fight scene at the end and some blood is shown, but it is not a violent keeping in mind it is a PG-13 rated movie.    Has your granddaughter read the books?  The last book of the series incorporates fornicating and other issues, but the couple in question are married at that point, which also happens in the fourth book.    Ultimately it is your choice. It's good that you're doing your research about it.  But if she has already read the books then she knows what happens.    Keep in mind that although it does involve vampires, it is not by any means your typical vampire movie.  It's a teenage love story that is inspiring and very touching.  You'll probably enjoy it too!|`|UO7hD2Plaa	it doesn't have gore or anything like that in it...my sis seen it and she was 13 and she loved it but it is up to x|`|afbac7f23976be867b3cfcaf71bed7f9aa	Twilight has next to no violence, and only one, brief kissing scene. I really wouldn't worry about content, it is pretty clean, and not a horror movie but a love story. You might even enjoy it!|`|7Vjbpe6qaa	Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) has always been a bit different, never caring about or fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix, Arizona high school. When her mother Renee (Sarah Clarke) remarries and decides to move with her new husband to Florida, and Bella decides to go live with her father, Charlie (Billy Burke), in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn't expect anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and dazzlingly beautiful Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), a boy unlike any she's ever met. Intelligent and witty, his piercing eyes see straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than any cheetah, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands, and he hasn't aged since 1918. Most importantly, he's a vampire. Like all vampires, he's immortal. He doesn't drink human blood (they're vampire "vegetarians"), which is rare among the vampire population. Instead, they go on regular "hiking" trips, where they feed on prey such as grizzly bears and mountain lions. For Edward, Bella is the thing he has waited ninety years for - a soul mate. But the closer they get, the more Edward must struggle to resist the primal pull of her scent, which could send him into an uncontrollable frenzy. And what will they do when James (Cam Gigandet), Laurent (Edi Gathegi), and Victoria (Rachel Lefevre) come into town and James sets his sights on Bella? Will true love prevail when Edward is forced to save her life and conquer his thirst? The true question is, When you can live forever, what do you live for?     Small synopsis.^    But as far as I know there isn't any cursing in it.|`|Lc54UYhXaa	twilight is rated pg 13, but there isn't anything in there. theres just soem kissing. no inappropriate language or sexuality. it really depends on ur granddaughters maturity. and ur own instincts|`|35770bf8f2d8c67783b3ab4e50bf146caa	http://www.kids-in-mind.com/t/twilight20...    It is all outlined here. If you want her to read, there's a book as well. It's like Harry Potter, where the movies really encourage kids to read. I think it's fine for a 12 year old, especially if you tell her it's got some scary parts in it, and if she's okay with that, then she can see it?|`|l7OVXO0Maa	Twilight is a very clean movie. Aside from one fight seen and one very brief kissing scene, I'd say that it would be okay for a 12 year old. There is no profanity and nothing that should alarm her. It is very much like Harry Potter, then again it is more of a love story than a fantasy. It does have vampires, though there are no blood drinking scenes. I hope I helped(:|`|ZuZqm7J5aa	Hey im A twelve year old myself and i LOVED it i saw it 12 times   and there is no violence there is one part were the kill another vampire but they dont show it and the kissing scene is fine they dont french because he could kill her so its very plain  not one curse word funny umm.....the kiss two times  by the way the do not eat people the eat animals    hope that helps  rachel  *BEWARE THOUGH*  SHE WILL LOVE ROBERT PATTINSON AS EDWARD CULLEN  AND MAKE SURE SHE PLUS YOU READ THE BOOKS!|`|VVNX1P3jaa	Well at least that she is close in to this movie, at least she doesn't want to see an R rated movie. Plus that sounds like quite a deal, I don't know about any movie theaters near me that do that. Here is the Movie Mom's review of the movie http://blog.beliefnet.com/moviemom/2008/...  . But you know your own granddaughter better then me. I haven't seen the movie, so I don't know whether or not, your granddaughter should see this movie or not.|`|7a4e85774d9b26f6d449d47e0beca2b5aa	Alright, I am going to insert a little MOTHERLY advice here.     The movie TWILIGHT is a good movie, but if Vampires are not your thing, than you may want to skip this particular show. Now I am not talking 'old school' vampires with fangs and coffins and aversion to daylight. This is a spin on vampires that brings them into the 21st Century and it is also a Teenage Love Story ( 108 yr old vamp who looks 17 and attends high school falls for a 17 yr old girl).  The language is minimal at best, and the sex is a nil ( just some smooching and then THAT is even tame), but the scare is there.  She is 12 and while she is still young, her maturity level is what would be at question here. My 11 yr old saw the movie although she didn't get alot of the ( well let's just say that it was a little over her head) and her dad and I were with her.  Wait until it comes out on DVD and then let her rent it and watch it at home with either you or Grandma or a girlfriend or two. I will warn you that the rest of the movies will come out soon and they get more 'adult' as they go ( she might be better off reading the books).  Talk to her mom and find out the kinds of shows she is used to watching and books that she has read ( I grew up on horror and supernatural romance to my mother's disgust and I'm 42 now with kids of my own who can take it or leave it).   At this point the worst case scenerio is that she falls in love with the boys and has a few bad dreams.|`|fYsXv8opaa	this movie ruined the book for me. if she hasn't read the series yet i'd say go for it

I could listen to them fairly often, don't own any of their music yet though.|`|vK9Vv9gjaa	all there songs sound the same, you cant tell when one ends and the other begins, did you see them get rocks thrown at them at a concert on you tube Hilarius.|`|C156l7vWaa	I think they're pretty good, not a huge fan but I listen to a song of theirs here and there.|`|7xRbEGt2aa	Maybe because they are Canadian. I think they're okay, "Rockstar" and "Gotta Be Somebody" are pretty good songs.|`|QyyCnPBDaa	here's the thing with nickelback... up in canada, they have this law that states that the music on the radio must be at least 50 percent canadian. no joke. so, nickelback has an almost guaranteed fan base of a good part of 32 million people. this secures a lot of funding to branch out into other markets, wether the markets like it or not. a band like nickelback can get away with being mediocre and having a manufactured sound because of this. this brings about resentment in the hardcore types because the band didn't really have to work as hard as some others to gain fame and riches. at least we don't have to listen to much creed anymore...|`|AIhL8wLkaa	A lot of people hate them for the following reasons:    1). Often redoing songs and re-released them as singles...How You Remind Me/Someday/Savin Me are all similar    2). They are overplayed on radio stations...pop stations (both top 40 and adult contemporary) overplays their poppy ballads...especially Photograph and Someday    3). They actually have some hard songs...Never Again, Animals, Something In Your Mouth, but always resorts to releasing ballads for money.    4). Holding back potentials...the band actually has potential to play music similar to Metallica's Black album, but often just work with simplistic formulas...see for example Creed...when Scott Stapp left and the others formed Alter Bridge, the music is more harder and intense on all instruments with insane riffs...|`|2bVxBCgzaa	Boring, repetitive, terrible lyrics, one-dimensional. They're not a BAD band, just so derivative. If Kroeger stepped outside his formula once in a while, they might be OK. But that new single- Something in Your Mouth- god, the lyrics are horrid!     Got to meet the hottie  With the million dollar body  They say it's over budget  But you'd pay her just to touch it  Come on  Needs to hit the big screen  And shoot a little love scene  If Hollywood had called her  She'd be gone before you hollered  Come on    Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong  Every sugar daddy hittin' on her all night long  Doesn't care about the money she could be with anybody  Ain't it funny how the hunny wanted you all along    (You naughty thing)  You're rippin' up the dance floor honey  (You naughty women)  You shake your *** around for everyone  (Your such a mover)  I love the way you dance with anybody  (The way you swing)  And tease them all by sucking on your thumb  You're so much cooler when you never pull it out  'Cause you look so much cuter  With something in your mouth    etc etc - Just AWFUL. Maybe if I was 13 I'd think these were great lyrics. I'll give them this- How You Remind Me is a really good song- but now everything they release sounds the same. It's the reason why Creed was so awful as well. Notice that 99 percent of people who hate Nickelback also hate Creed?  There's just so much more worthy music in the world besides this commercial, angsty CRAP that is forced down people's throats on MTV or whatever.    EDIT*- The Canadian Content rules are NOT 50%- CanCon simply states that a certain percentage (35%) of music on Canadian radio between 6a.m. and 6p.m. must have two of four elements- perfomed, produced,  or lyrics or music written by a Canadian. So for instance, let's say that Pearl Jam wanted to record a cover of a Neil Young song. Neil young is Canadian, so the music and lyrics were written by a Canadian, so it would qualify. Another example would be Metallica recording in Vancouver, and the song lyrics are written by Bob Rock, a Canadian producer- this would also qualify. It basically helps level the playing field; when you have ten times the population in the USA, with massive promotional budgets, as well as the huge British industry,  it makes sense to have some degree of local support in less-populated countries.  Many other countries have similar quotas- it helps to support emerging local artists and recording industries- unfortunately, sometimes the Nickelbacks of the world slip through... But for instance, Arcade Fire broke outside of Canada before receiving any airplay at home.|`|XW4pa8Pzaa	i don't hate them, they rock! my favorite is far away ;)|`|8790e9fc78bbbb4628df687c604fba86aa	No I don't think they suck. I love them! Some of my friends love them as well. I think they have a lot of good songs. Some songs kindda sound the same, but in general they have a lot of good songs!|`|WU4MHq3aaa	well im biased cause i live like 4 hours from their hometown so im not coming near this argument|`|1vCoaf08aa	Because they're corporate sell outs.

hqjJV70Eaa	I believe in love at first sight, but that does not mean that you see some actor in a movie or some band on a stage and you're in love.  I believe that you can love someone on sight, but it takes time to fall in love.  You have to know that person, really know the person not read interviews that they did.      I'm like you I have my strong likes for people.  I adore Robert Pattinson but that's because when I met him he was really a sweet guy.  He joked around with us and just acted normal - not like some conceited actor/heart throb. He was really fun to just hang back and talk too.    But, I do have my lusts for certain actors.  It's purely a physical thing towards them because I don't know them.    I would never inflict wounds or pain to myself for anyone.  Like those girls who made scabs so they could pick them off when Robert walked by.  Grow up.  I would definately not give away all my possessions, they need to like/love me for me.  As for why I would date an actor would be because I liked them.  You don't love someone because they have money.    But, I was sorry to read that you thought love took time and effort.  It was the effort that bothered me because I don't think that love should be an effort, I think it should come naturally with the right person for you.  That means that you actually spend time with the person and love just develops naturally.|`|3dzuYTC5aa	Its a word with lots of meanings..... yoru just asking to annoy people... get a life!!! Trust me u in your lifetime have said I Love Chocolate or cookies or something..... have u thought of marrying your favorite icecream???? Or maybe getting it on with a nice popcicle???!!!! Have fun hunny!!!!!!!|`|XSa8fgNIaa	well i love them, so what if i dont know them theyre celebrities!  Thats how it works you love and hate people you dont know! lol  anyway i love them but im not obsessed|`|MXpW48lFaa	I think your question is;  How can you not love celebrities?    hahahaha|`|3ok7pKMNaa	It just happens.|`|qeeem2giaa	i like the characters actors play but i don't like them. i guess people like them because they're only exposed to their good side and not their bad side, that is, what inevitably comes out in real life|`|iz8hh0vNaa	I like the Jonas Brothers, I'm not a nutty fan.  I don't understand why people go all crazy though and everything.  It's just because if they were'nt famous, you would have no idea who they were and wouldn't think anything of it.  I mean, if you look at it in reality, what is the chance that you ended up with one of them?  It's so low I wouldn't even bother.  I mean, the Jonas Brothers are great guys, and all the fans know that, but some have gone way past obsession and have gone into the stalkerish stage, and in my opinion this is half the reason so many people hate them, because the fans won't stop blabbering about them.    I'm starting to crush on older celebrities like Dustin Milligan and James Franco.  Even slimmer chance, but I can drool over them because I just need to pop in several DVDs and stare....    I still do love the Jonas Brothers, but never in my right mind would I think that I'd end up with one of them.  Just let them stay your celebrity crush, there's no need to dedicate your life to celebrities.    Just remember this one thing, it's a very popular line heard in movies, but it's also often true in reality, it's called  LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT. You look at them, and love them almost straight away.

F08qx2hgaa	1.) Agony  2.) Misery  3.) Anger  4.) Regret  5.) Embarrassment    The first four can make life simply unbearable. Embarrassment? Quite endurable, forgetable, and possibly humerous when you look back at it.     Regret can be quite a weight. But it can also be overcome, with time. Regret can be a sign of remorse, which if deserved can be good for a person; it can make them repent or come to a needed realization. Respectively, it could also give you a false realization.    Anger can be good, if controled. It can be used as fuel to do good, to correct wrong as much as it can create wrong or fuel evil.    Misery... the ultimate saddness? It can give so much pain.    Agony. Hard to endure. It can hold saddness and regret, as well as anger. It can come from any sort of overpowering emotion, sometimes turning good emotions bad.    I'm quite curious to see how you'd rate them.|`|RaBflUE0aa	misery  regret  embarrassment  agony   anger    i have anger issues...|`|4EflpUK8aa	Agony  Misery  Embarrassment  Regret  Anger

ErAgEgjUaa	I had a physical education (gym) teacher way back in grade ten who was an absolute *itch.  so I never went to her class, because i couldn't stand the woman.  She was always picking on me, probably because she knew what I thought of her.  So I just stopped going to her dumb P.E. class... and she was such a *itch that she came and told me that that because she had given me an F, I would NEVER graduate from highschool >because it was 'mandatory to pass PE in grade ten to graduate'..   I think that gives you a sense what kind of teacher she was.?  .  So  ... WE MOVED!  Haha and somehow... the 'school records' got lost, before I entered grade 11.  Now I wonder, just 'how' that happened?.  I would like to send her an anonymous letter to tell her that the fact that she failed me in her lame class never made a squat of difference in my life, only I can't remember her name.   She was rather a forgettable person.  Imagine, thinking you can change somebody's life because they don't participate in Physical Education in grade ten... truly pathetic.  Small minded people, who think their own little world is the most important thing going...|`|1YTmgAc3aa	I pretty much got low scores in every single class throughout highschool only because I was too lazy and stupid to learn anything...  Now, I regret it...|`|UY2CPmroaa	i got a 78 in math.  ms. moler.  she was MEAAN.  and the class was boring!!|`|tqIaTWkHaa	C, in honors math  yeah, it was bad, and my parents were really mad. But that was like in 7th grade.|`|KHL4N6mtaa	my lowest class grade was a 40. it was my freshman year in high school. it was an art class. i never went to the class.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	B in math in grade 7  It wasn't that it was boring or that i didn't get it...but i always seemed to have appointments when we did math so i missed quite a bit..|`|MyV9qm99aa	B-  I got whooped for this in 9th grade    GOD BLESS|`|7pgHntqjaa	i left my school with a D in math. no, it was nothing against my teacher it's the kids i couldn't STAND [ahem spoiled, snooty, stuck up, brats] who didn't know ANYTHING. they were HORRIBLE. a freshman who acted like a 5 year old and a kid who threw things at people and cried constantly, etc. ughh SOoOo happy to be outta that school.|`|VHQ7l1fMaa	45- in PE. my teacher is digusting and she hates me because i don't care about PE and goof off. she used to be in the military and thinks that everyone should be perfect and not talk at all. i do the opposite of that:) haha|`|mAV5MJQnaa	Its been a long time since I have been to school, cant remember, there were times when I git bad grades, and there were times when I got good grades.|`|I4bALymyaa	89 in calculus- My parents are freaks. They decided for me years ago that I'm going to medical school.|`|0NzcNoL6aa	FAIL  teacher should not even be aloud to teach|`|ctglkb4Paa	D|`|lQaeb2wNaa	F. I won't say what teacher, but it was reading. 7th.|`|BN4Gkjvcaa	63 and I got beat by my parents for it.|`|6qPVGyNQaa	33 in PE, the teacher was an asshole and the class was torture|`|VrpLHRnwaa	c in math. 6th.  c in history. freshman.  c in biology i think? freshman.|`|T5ruXVlIaa	I got a B-  In Scripture.  I would rather not mention the teacher's name, I HATE that man.|`|ZQjeuTdzaa	C....english|`|PauJZY1Xaa	F- in algebra. Didn't think it was possible...  The class was uber boring, and my parent got pissed at me ALOT.    ;AustralianNinja|`|8fyk1xJyaa	I had a 55 in Calculus.  My teacher's tests were too hard for me, no matter how hard I studied.|`|eksiuO4daa	I think I got a B.|`|0PEVAuIkaa	Mine was a "C". The class was World History, with a boring teacher, first class in the morning so I couldn't ever pay attention. In 7th grade(:|`|C0b6q7hiaa	D once in a quarter of math...nothing too bad.   It wasn't really the teacher's fault, I've always been good with math, particularly on standardized test, I just don't like doing math class.
yL8kOr5Saa	with respect and dignity maybe alittle compassion  and on another note like we are cvompatent and capable also we may seem totally independent but  totally dig lasting relation ships|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	with respect
afbac7f23976be867b3cfcaf71bed7f9aa	I work at a movie theater so I can tell you:    Yes, it is a solid R, lots of blood and nudity. If you want to see it, your mom has to see it with you.    You could just do what I did at your age and buy a ticket to another movie and walk into Friday the 13th....|`|NSgSaspAaa	The movie will be rated R  more than likely due to the violence, language, etc.  Your mom will need to be with you when you buy the ticket but she won't need to go in with you more than likely because they'll assume that the ticket seller checked to make sure of your age and if you had a guardian.|`|iUSwoDVsaa	Big Fat R: for 'all Friday the 13th movies R-gayness'.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	It will be R for the gore and violence. Potentially a nude scene/sex scene|`|8m0OWTO8aa	It's rated R|`|AA11314600	Rated "R"- lots of violence and language.  Probably a nude scene also.|`|LaQSbDX6aa	yes|`|1YhbtB7Haa	Yep is supposed to be rated R, and yes, an adult guardian has to accompany you into an R-rated film.     Look here for a guide on it's content:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080761/pare...    I guess it'll be pretty awkward if your mom was watching this type of movie with you...|`|K1JGsa8Caa	The movie is rated R just announced today.    The Description:    "strong bloody violence, some graphic sexual content, language and drug material"
cuIX13BKaa	Truth though an unwritten codicil is that you get a lap dance from everyone who responded to this question! Congrats!

Jg8ngWj0aa	First of all -- he isnt worth it if hes trying to show off his unreal "line of girls." Capricorns are mostly self-critical and independent. Gemini's are the one's to talk about themselves in a heartbeat. But I mean, you always find traits of yourself in other zodiacs. They are about 97% true. If he's going to act like that, though, so not worth your time. Trust me, coming from a Sadge even though I'm not into dating and such (true to my sign, haha), guys like that arent worth it. You can piss him off and play with his game aswell. Tell him that you dont need him since you've got someone else -- but thank him for the offer! ;)|`|0IKwusdgaa	Capricorns arent narcissists. They are the opposites. They always put themselves down and they dont have much self respect - however it gets better in late years. Perhaps this guy is doing it to make himself feel and look better becuase inside he feels like he has no/little worth. And really, he is if he acts that way to you even if he isnt that way insde. Dont wait for him and see where his pride goes...|`|mAzgILpfaa	Us capricorns are way too good .. but we won't go around tellin other people.  We like to show it indirectly.|`|AA12215623	They so aren't worth all the attention they get. They all brag about **** they don't do or have. They always need a ego boost and are status seeking. They are validated by others opinions not by who they are. This one sounds like he aint ****. Leave him alone he'll need you before u need him.|`|3YdDpReTaa	Go you!    Screw him if he wants to put himself first, any girl that gets stuck with him deserves that loser!    Ok, so I am a Capricorn and am privately narcissistic, but I dont show it or act that way at all around other people (I used to, however), as it proved to be too much of an annoyance to myself and others.  Seems like this guy is on the extreme though.  I've met a few Capricorns and all have been a bit narcissistic, so I will say that this behavior is normal, but that doesnt mean you have to put up with it.|`|lmWlVh5kaa	Screw him girl. I am a Capricorn and i cant treat a girl that way merely because she is interested in me.You wont want a guy who is that selfish  all the time, forget him and go for the right guy. He(right guy) might just be at the corner.|`|cVVvHNXSaa	What an a**hole! This is a first - Capricorns are not like that, he gives a bad name to all Capricorns. Don't waste your time with him, tell him he will have to wait his turn next time.    Capricorn Sun here who never feels like I'm the best thing that ever happened, lol!|`|CEEQDSCFaa	like that guy said, capys can be narcissists but they wont go screaming and telling people about it, Capricorns are insecure, and they dont brag, infact they dont get enough of anything    too much Leo in that dudes chart lmao    why dont you slap some sense into him
WU4MHq3aaa	Excellent song... lol... I love ANGUS hes so cute! that made me laugh      MQ:Cocaine- Eric Clapton orrr any AC/DC song you wish to interpret... just kiddin|`|DbtS5jzEaa	haha NOICE song choice :)|`|YwtXSUAdaa	MA: Psychopsilocybin- Incubus|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I love that song, actually just listened to it on my way home.    MA: Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds - The Beatles.  Here's a no brainer - Mary Jane's Last Dance - Tom Petty      EDIT*- Yea, it isn't entirely about drugs.  It supposedly comes from a painting done by Lennon's son, which is probably the truth, but...     "McCartney agrees in a 2004 interview, where he noted that Julian's painting had inspired the song, but that it was "pretty obvious" that the song was also inspired by LSD."    I got that off wikipedia, so take it how you think it is, but I always found it much more likely that the song was about drugs.  Confusing, I know.|`|7B2s7maWaa	Great choice! I was listening to that song not to long ago actually.  Thanks for posting. (:    mq:"Time To Pretend"-MGMT  "Cocaine"-Eric Clapton|`|CTQNPj56aa	nice song  i personally like the johnson era of AC/DC better though    Sweet Leaf & Snowblind- both by Black Sabbath|`|kP0JGI1waa	Good song of choice, I thought it was going to be a link to a Lil Wayne song or something lol.    MQ: Well I listen to a ton of stoner rock/doom, so I dont even know where to start, the most obvious being Dopesmoker, Dopethrone, 666 Pound Bongsession, Reefer Sutherland, Sweet Leaf, etc.
baR28Sq4aa	13?...I was 38...my friend and I laughed so hard,I had to change clothes before we went to a meeting...shes hilarious!|`|UPdJF0tyaa	12,i laughed too hard too...haha.|`|mMi19s7Vaa	kindergarten age =]|`|ENspyhzUaa	2nd grade, but only because the teacher was a douche and wouldn't let me go to the bathroom when i really needed to go, she then blamed me for having a bladder problem, heard a couple years later she got cancer, that's karma for you|`|BBVfRheyaa	yesterday.|`|KxPm8tBgaa	1st grade|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Last week, I was drunk and didn't make it to the bathroom. I am 20|`|ERGGLvYiaa	I was potty trained before I was one and never peed my pants in my life.|`|WggRi7MZaa	Probably grade 6, so I was like 11.|`|Y6xanshEaa	8.    I was too shy to ask to use the bathroom in school often,so I often peed my pants,like 2 times that semester..|`|TEnvIAjraa	10...4th grade  My art teacher didn't notice my hand raised.. so I thought I could let out a little and then be fine...  I ended up peeing on the guy I had a crush on      GOOD TIMES|`|CEAJBk73aa	Kindergarten. Seriously.|`|lIQhB56Oaa	6th grade, the teacher would'nt let me go to the bathroom.  So i just ran out into the hall and ran to the nearest bathroom, but I forgot I was wearing a belt, so I couldn't get my pants off in time.  afterwards i just went to the nurse and me dad picked me up lol|`|sw7kRBSYaa	17 i was laughing very hard|`|Asj4Usqkaa	22. Just today..|`|3BX15PwBaa	7,when I still was ticklish.|`|JU26EGAeaa	I JIZZED IN MY PANTS|`|NrbLdZzOaa	I cant remember...honestly. I know I have done it, but I was very young at the time and couldnt find a bathroom. Like, maybe 6 years old?     Its not something I enjoy doing haha.|`|RoBmEehMaa	i was like 7 or something|`|VvZ1hUChaa	ummm i'd have to say when i was 14 i was camping and had to pee really bad and forgot to pull my pants down :)|`|TZO9eZfHaa	13. But I am 13 aha|`|0PEVAuIkaa	I think I was 8 because I had a dream I was peeing and I really was. Lol. Never happened after that(: Thank God.|`|AA11369490	it was actually when i was in 9th grade. i had to go really bad but i locked myself out. i lifted my leg up to climb through the window and it came out.|`|mXG5H0mMaa	I was 10 and at a funeral, the graveside service.  It was February and about 10 degrees.  The blasted minister went on and on and on.  I couldn't hold it.|`|49niWB6Qaa	16. I was so drunk I don't remember anything that night, but I woke up in a puddle.|`|GbzxnGcIaa	I was 14 and it was when I watch American Idol audition and I'm sure you know what contestant's audition make me wet my pants if you get what I mean.Until now,I opt to watch for the 13 finalists only and skip the whole audition(:|`|IVna6e8Maa	I think I was 8...we had gone to see Hercules (the Disney film) in theatres, and we had to bus home, and I really needed to pee (I forgot to go before we left).  So I held it and held it and held it for what seemed like forever, and we finally made it home, and I had just closed the bathroom door behind me when my bladder let loose.  I could see the toilet!  I was so close!|`|ZQjeuTdzaa	like kindergarden  but i have let out like 2 drops at like 13, but noone else can notice, my pants dont even get wet|`|YgzpSbxdaa	I was about 12 and it was because we were walking back from the shop.I was busting to go and there were no toilets around, my sister refused to let me go behind a bush (she's funny like that, what if there's bugs and what not) so i had to walk back home really quickly. It happened right across the road from our house. I could see our house right in front of me. It was so embarrassing and preventable too.|`|ko3J5akPaa	10 years old i think.|`|2NXIoHE8aa	lol. i think it was 7|`|vdcUYLztaa	Last year.    I was just finished (or so I thought) peeing in a urinal and then when I put my willy back into my fly, i felt a couple squirts of... you know... on the inside of my pants...    I FORGOT TO DO THE AFTER-PISS SHAKE AND JIGGLE.    DAMN...|`|KHL4N6mtaa	i was probably about 15. i thought it would be smart to hold my pee until i got home from school. my hands were freezing from the cold so i couldn't get my pants unbuttoned !

3nICmHUhaa	hey there, i went to the link and listened to the song.   i think its pretty catchy and its a good song, but its definantly not my style, keep in mind that im a teenager, so im into all the new upbeat music. there will be many many people that will love this song and the style of this song but most of these people will be in there 30's or higher. my conclusion is that more people will prefer todays music, this is because teenagers are the main source in todays music society, and most teenagers prefer new music.  hope this helps :D|`|2oI1iKRVaa	Try here.

I love how it incorporated fun, catchy dance tunes with blues genre....oh, and sparticus was hot

AA10300538	Blonde Joke:    So this blonde chick gets a call that her mother has died just as she was preparing to go to work. She cries and cries, then decides to go to work anyway- she needs the distraction. She gets to work, but cant control herself. Her boss comes to find out whats wrong. She tells him her mother just died...and he suggests her taking a day off....but she adamantly says she wants to be kept busy and that she'll control the tears.  The boss walks by her desk a few hours later, and this time the blonde is bawling, like weeping her eyes out even harder. The boss asks what happened to make her even worse...blonde replies, "my twin sister just called me....she said her mother just died too..!!!!!!!!!!"  lmao    Blonde Joke:  So a blonde goes to a tech store to buy a tv. She asks the sales rep how much the tv is. He says, "im sorry, we dont sell to blondes".  Confused and a little pissed, she stomps off....  The next day, she dyes her hair red and goes back to the shop. "How much is that tv?" Rep :im sorry, we dont sell to blondes"...  Frustrated and wondering how he knew...she goes home and decides to dye her hair brunette. She goes back to the store the following day. "How much is that tv?" Rep: im sorry, we do not sell to blondes".  This time, she is so curious, she asks, "well, how do u know that im blonde??"  The rep says, "well, thats not a tv, its a microwave!"  hahahaha|`|NsYPUHOcaa	Hilarious...really!|`|9dNPN9CSaa	Ladeeez & mental men    Having turned 61 on Yuesday, I realise that is blond for Tuesday    & dat da folk who'd adore '60s pop icons mock 'em now they are in their 60s    & blond/blonde    To wit, to woo, how do you do?    http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...

I come from a time when the lunchboxes that were made are worth hundreds maybe thousands of dollars as collectors items today. There were ones made with scenes from popular TV shows at the time. One in particular was Lost in Space with Will Robinson, Dr. Smith, and the Robot in a classic pose on the front. The back had the Jupiter 2 crash landing on a desolate planet with a giant cyclops looming behind it. The sides had an internal view of the Jupiter 2. There were variations on this design but basically it retained these essential components. My Favorite Martian was a popular one too. Back in the mid to late 60s they only cost $1. If only I knew then what I know now.|`|0mhcCyE5aa	My Strawberry Shortcake metal lunch box!!!|`|iKmkRaqBaa	I had many lunch boxes.

My lunchbox had sticks of carrot and cellery etc (My mom was a health freak)  ....and hers included choc-chip muffins and cupcakes and stuff like that, every day of the week.     Ergo, hers was my favourite box.    My mission each day was to charm and sweet-talk her so she would offer one of those precious baked items at lunch.     It worked too.     All through school I scored some of her mom's baking...and gradually down through our school years, we became the best of mates and that girl became the most important person in my life. ........These days the mom brings my favourite choc-chip muffins over to our house regularly.......     (right when the summer moon is full and a heady evening breeze ruffles the curtains and there is dancing and music and cheese and italian bread and goblets of french wine and she always arrives exactly when we want to practice making babies.....)    .........and she won't go home for DAYS !!!      .|`|Dj3w4uCDaa	I had a lovely red plaid lunchbox with matching thermos, I looked positively fetching when I wore my red sweater and shoes.

Perhaps into the second part of the school year, I was 7, I ripped the cover from it and tossed the whole thing into the rubbish container. From then on, I carried my lunch in a paper bag everyday. Put my thermos in my school bag. My mother already aware of my fiery temperament, never did ask ONE question about what had happened to what she thought was such an adorable, little girlish box, she herself had gotten for me. For had she asked, I would have simply let her know HOW MUCH I'D ALWAYS HATE IT! I guess even then, there was something in me, perhaps not much at all, which did not want my integral wrath to blow a flame of anger-fire right back at her...after all, she'd only thought the lunch box would make her little girl happy and oh, so, girlish...So WHY hurt her good intentions, right???

dBLdXm7gaa	She isn't confirmed yet she is in consideration    "A rep for Summit Entertainment, the company behind the hit cult Twilight films, confirmed that Dakota is indeed being considered: We are considering all actors that have the unique requirements for the look of Jane  Dakota being one of them.    Said three days ago.|`|AA11848927	Dakota is a perfect & natural actress who is born to act. Kristen is on top of her game too she was the only (natural) female actress in Twilight and  now in New Moon she will have somebody to feed off.

im8OSdGTaa	Unlike Luffy, sasuke doesn't have major energy levels and even with his Sharingan it would be challenging to fight Luffy because of one major fact: Luffy's Utterly Stupid Insanity. Insanity is basically something impossible to predict with the Sharingan and despite having magic powers Luffy would probably figure out a way to deal with the fight. Sasuke would have advatages though, you know with all his magic powers and whatnot. It would be a pretty even fight.    So here's my final thoughts:    A fight without powers or chalkra: Luffy all the way.  A fight with powers and chalkra: Pretty even, but depending on the location either could have an advantage.If i\ontop of water, Sasuke, but on land Luffy would have an advantage with speed (depsite Sasukes ninja skills) and surprise. Theres a higher chance Sasuke would win though despite my support of Luffy.    But in the end Luffy wins cuz he has Nakama.|`|9qc3YoGIaa	Monkey D. Luffy    He has more power and spirit to win.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Monkey D. Luffy|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Luffy would kick Saskue's ***. No offense saskue fans but rubber doesn't conduct electricity and Luffy can stretch to avoid that black fire.|`|fawhiGtsaa	Monkey D. Luffy.|`|WS1rqp0Gaa	Uchiha Sasuke|`|VmXq5NCOaa	Luffy is the mah-AN!!!|`|2jxWrnUGaa	Monkey D. Luffy!|`|h9S8AdGoaa	Well if Sasuke is 15 and he can use his curse mark( the 2 mode) then yeah Sasuke will win. And if he uses his new sharingan.

XcfgCOCoaa	A woman was helping her husband set up his computer, and at the appropriate point in the process, told him that he would now need to enter a password. Something he will use to log on.

She tells the clerk, 'I would like to buy a pair of pink curtains.  'The clerk assures her that they have a large selection of pink curtains.  She shows her several patterns but the blonde seems to be having a hard time choosing.  Finally she selects a lovely pink floral print.  The clerk then asks what size curtains she needs.  The blonde promptly replies, 'Seventeen inches.'  'Seventeen inches?' asked the clerk. 'That sounds very small. What room are they for?'  The blonde says, 'They aren't for a room. They are for my new computer monitor.  'The surprised clerk replies, 'But Miss, computers do not need curtains!'  The blonde says, 'Hellllooooooooo ...

UPS Guy: Little boy, is your mother home?  Little Boy: Yes.  So the guy goes to the door and knocks and knocks and knocks for over an hour.  UPS Guy: I thought you said your mother was home.

The other guy whips out his cell phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps to the operator: My friend is dead! What can I do?    The operator, in a calm, soothing voice, says: Just take it easy. I can help. First, lets make sure hes dead.    There is a silence, then a shot is heard. The guys voice comes back on the line. He says: Okay, now what?    OR:    Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson goes on a camping trip. After a good dinner and a bottle of wine, they retire for the night, and go to sleep. Some hours later, Holmes wakes up and nudges his faithful friend.    Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see.    I see millions and millions of stars, Holmes, replies Watson.    And what do you deduce from that?    Watson ponders for a minute.    Well, astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo. Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three.    Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful and that we are a small and insignificant part of the universe. What does it tell you, Holmes?    Holmes is silent for a moment. Watson, you idiot! he says. Someone has stolen our tent!

tVvH28GCaa	Lelouch from Code Geass vs. Light Yagami from Death Note  Lelouch, though it would be close. Light is smart, but he didn't play chess as much as Lelouch did.      Dr. Walter Bishop from Fringe vs. Gregory House from House    Dr. Bishop. I think House is better at guessing people's feelings, not their next chess move.|`|Q69EHENuaa	The first semi final is definetely a hard one. Both competitiors are really good, but i think i have to go for Light. I mean that guy was up against L in a sort of real life chess game. While lelouch may be good and all i go for Light.    The second one is Gregory house. No doubt about it.

I've seen it first hand|`|raUjKchLaa	Because common sense cannot be learned in front of a TV or with a DS or Gameboy in your hand.|`|98yFxXi9aa	Nowaday people are weird so their common sense became uncommon.|`|BBVfRheyaa	Common sense is changeable.|`|jDgU9qzjaa	technology|`|Asj4Usqkaa	Careless people|`|kecpGboNaa	with todays electronics you dont have to think for yourself. my iphone does everything for me. its sad but true|`|ctglkb4Paa	young people are getting mileytized from listening to her music|`|YzCTq13caa	Sex and violence is being discovered at younger ages.|`|P9K7AYmWaa	technology. immaturaty is common. im 14 and even i say todays young people are...|`|aaQUMXUzaa	it's a shame it is so uncommon now.

Dnf4ijdJaa	no but you were right to say no, why would anyone pay to get other people drunk. thats so stupid lol|`|pNUtnoC8aa	No I haven't.  Next time take your own cup so they don't know, or wait for everyone to get really drunk and sneak in.|`|OJtFNjfvaa	That sounds like a homo party! Who the hell drinks beer at a party? Jeez makes me fall asleep before I even get in the mood! Pulls out the Jack Daniels|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	well girls usually dont have to pay, and if you know the party host, then you can usually get it for free... i never had to pay, but the most my guy friends ever had to was like $10 and it was a SICK party|`|x2OgEVt3aa	I don't like parties; hence, I do not go to them.|`|s1leABaSaa	they have that at alot of partys in perth aye.  like you pay a $5 entry fee. and thats for any damage that may happen|`|AA11749193	Just be yourself....    I've had this type of crapola happen, and I just laughed in their face and said, "What did you dream the next night?"|`|3q3bXWMFaa	so i take it you paid?  oh you say you didn't,but come on now what do we know,we/I don't know you from Adam.  you could have said you didn't pay knowing you did cause you wanted to party.  if this was a house party then you truly wasted you time and money anyway.|`|8ZUVToXgaa	It's just to support the party. If it was 5 bucks or something, it's not THAT big a deal.|`|e7uUfLsqaa	yes..actually.  But I do drink, so it wasn't a big deal.    But you were right to say no.  That makes no sense.|`|AA11523465	How do THEY know that?  They're charging everyone just to make sure.|`|jDgU9qzjaa	Get used to it, we're in a recession.|`|e3AnmkfUaa	You should be a gentleman and pay for the drinks the women you prey on get drunk with.|`|37X9zjS4aa	haha omg thats stupid     i agree with you|`|4hEbaIMOaa	you're right.|`|1Gv7Dtoxaa	ya and i don't drink either i thought it was kinda stupid so i found the person who's party it was and got my money back!!|`|ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	if you say no, either you're not getting in or they'll all think you're a deuchbag, so it's your choice|`|IXgPHYbDaa	Yeah..    they wanted 3.00 to get in the door .    I turned around, went home.. Called up my friends that were at the party, and told them to come over im having a party.    And almost EVERYONE at that party came to mine.    The dude that was charging peps to party got so mad i heard.  lmao! thats what he gets for trying to charge me LOL|`|0400db1548cbd1783dd1b282afe50eddaa	When you go to a buffet, you may not eat "everything" that they put out ... but you have pay to play!|`|M4nXH7DTaa	yeah never heard of having to pay to get in.... i do the same.. my b/f has the partys and i never drink. i always am the DD|`|UJ6FBGRyaa	yea u should said no. and y did they even do that for drinking beer?  lol =O|`|4a4795e43d693be3aa7146aa0989ea2daa	No. If that incident happened to me, I would turn around and leave. I think that kind of party is not unusual. What is unusual in your story is that the invitation did not say so.    When the hosts mention it right at the get go, you have the option not to come at all. This saves the trouble of getting dressed, spending money to get to the place, and the annoyance later.    Your friend was inconsiderate.|`|i2YSNj1waa	That money isn't just for beer.  It goes towards the host in one way or another.  After the party, someone is expected to clean up. Someone should get paid for that.  And people who host parties are pretty much just looking for a profit.  Im sure that not every person at a given party drinks 10 dollars worth of beer.  That would be chaos.  Plus, if the party has beer, it has probably had more thought and planning put into it than any other party. So your also paying for a good party and to have fun if not for your share of beer.|`|Kbgc6x5raa	never happened to me before but i definitely know what you mean.|`|EPaYoJaiaa	nope, cause my friends weren't drunken alcoholics. Those are usually the parties REALLY not worth going in to, those are the ones where a few girls get raped and/or someone gets really sick from alcohol poisoning and either ends up in the hospital or dead. How in the world is that fun? Nope, I hung out with normal people.|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	That's when I whip out my 12 pack and ask where the fridge is.|`|mggll8dRaa	Always there is Someone 'Making Money' on those Parties....!!|`|xOqJcJaNaa	i wouldnt either

Not all 12 year olds are..Moronic.|`|KxPm8tBgaa	Well you know it's true.|`|3BX15PwBaa	Not all of these 12 year olds are ignorant.    We were all 12 year olds a while back.|`|aGtcgSrnaa	Hey, ur right, lol anyways I doubt they meant it like that|`|ZsKrYCYCaa	you were reading the definition below it, it actually says "see mirror".|`|1AR6zUIdaa	lol. well, all Jonas Brother fans are 12. that must  mean something. haha.    XD|`|ZQjeuTdzaa	Definition: very stupid person  lol thats what i found|`|1ZGZeW7Zaa	no offence taken|`|acMlpOjxaa	what wrong with having the mental capacity of a 12 yr old? i enjoy it everyday... all the privileges of being an adult with none of the responsibility....|`|a40380daa8f8c7c0761b53d6ecfddb40aa	Most 12 year olds are very immature.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	I was a moron at twelve.

mLqJYrFGaa	it means any age can attend.|`|tVvH28GCaa	All ages means all ages. Doesn't matter what age. Certain places have raves for all ages, so the younger generation can see what raves are so they can be paying customers when they're older.    Keep in mind that raves arn't usually the place for kids, so if you're wondering if you're too young to go, you shouldn't be going.
z5GwTXx6aa	Lonewolf McQuade  I do like most of his action films**|`|4bWUiIVdaa	The one that was never made|`|BBVfRheyaa	I like colonel Bradog series.

O.O|`|Z4mLZxLcaa	Well i thought that all of his movies suxed except for the cameo appearance he made in Dodgeball. But he was great in Walker Texas Ranger.|`|jhVpSq2yaa	this question is like a paradox, any movie chuck norris is in is obviously not a good movie|`|lhH7vynGaa	That's like asking 'what's the best thing you can get at McDonald's?'|`|eOX8U3bAaa	Enter the Dragon    Stars Bruce Lee.  However, the fight scene w/ Chuck and one with Kareem Abdul Jabbar was awesome.    Chuck's "Delta Force" is his best staring role.  Octagon was good too.|`|8y4cJLyXaa	I have been a Chuck Norris fan since I was a kid. Yeah his movies were mostly popcorn fair with little or no substance, but he was at one point a top 5 box office draw in the 80's.  My favorite as well as a lot of Norris fans is Lone Wolf McQuade. It came came out in 83. Another was Code of Silence which came out in 85.  (His part was offered to Clint Eastwood first) And The Delta Force with Lee Marvin. Other movies were Missing in Action 1,2,3,, Silent Rage, A Force of One.  But the best was Lone Wolf Mcquade.

gDksphD0aa	Homerlv showed you a link to profesional Video cameras used for TV news and such but for film makers most still use Kodack cameras|`|L1qQBNbbaa	The top two brands are Sony and Panasonic,these are proffessional cameras,good link below.    Edit: wake up bob flim cameras are going by the wayside,80% of all "films" are shot on HD video.and hey my link did include a 16 mm camera.
8yE2sYGeaa	Most films use 35mm, although when you do IMAX you do 70mm, but on its side, so the picture is really big.    The safe link below show the actual size of one frame of each film size|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	70mm|`|LaQSbDX6aa	8mm|`|RDoH7Ac9aa	what is "mm"?|`|stD322SIaa	35mm for normal movies, 70mm for high resolution, 16mm for documentaries, 8mm for home movies.|`|gDksphD0aa	Standard film is 35mm.70mm is used for panoramic type films like IMAX|`|R4PI1BPMaa	I would assume 16mm, it's kinda like the AK47 of the camera industry, it's always been there, and it's had a couple knock offs but 16mm has still been used in even semi recent movies. 8mm revolutionized the home video industry but never really got into actual Hollywood scene for very long. 35mm is the new stuff around and I'm guessing it's been around since somewhere early 00's (?) and late 90's. But 16mm has been around for much longer and has much more experience in the field. 35mm would probably come in second but 70mm just hasn't had enough time and price equivalence so that the studio can't justify the price. Though I'm almost positive the newest star wars that wasn't animated was filmed on 70mm and it got hug buzz about it but I couldn't tell the difference from average film besides special effects

HKBSuDD7aa	interesting question,i was just talking to someone the other day about a test,and or rule a woman would have to stand up to,after what i have been through..  of course this would depend on what she was being tested on,as for now days one has to test to see who really is even a friend,let alone a lover,or if ur looking for just in general,as looks of a girl..  in basics,she would have to be attractive to me,good personality,humorous is good,honest,caring.understanding.kind hearted.if she's a lover,then all of them plus,showing that i am her man,showing that i am the only one she's flirting with and giving attention to..i do have a basic test,will post it on hear,one of these days now,see what others say..oh and there must be trust..|`|kUsm71nnaa	No games|`|EVnlDpPUaa	Me,i just love them all i do! x|`|996395421d166d021ac24276056cd66baa	notice me and i must be attracted to her in some way|`|49453d694f826403d6e8252680ce8ddcaa	she must be athletic and outgoing|`|xvvlYuNtaa	attitude
C156l7vWaa	I think it means that you don't need to go at the pace of others and think what they think, feel what they feel (If you assume just like them what good will it do?) and that you just need to find who you are in the masses of confusion that can sometimes surround us|`|TtCWfrxjaa	i think it means not to worry about yesterday or tomorrow just take life one step at a time and breathe while you have the chance. because if you are so caught up in the future or the past you don't realize what is happening in the present.

Well, did everyone here know that you don't have to have sex to get pregnant? Wow really? It's true. Whoa I never knew. Now you do.    There are several ways. Sperm donation. Artificial insemination.

A woman came over to the deep end where I was and started talking about how she hated coming here (the pool) when the workers where nearby because they kept stareing at her swimsuit.   I had just been semi floating in the water and knew someone was there but had not looked. I then looked over at her, curious about her swimsuit. only to find that it was a sheer white thong (probably panties) and no top. I could not hide the look of suprise on my face and she said.... huh.. typical guy got out and left    a few days later I saw her there again and she told me she did it all on a dare and hoped I didnt mind.   I told her.. Im 15.. I saw you naked in a public place... why would I mind?|`|RsenWiWfaa	Last summer me and a friend did a two week program at Brown. One day we decided to go into Providence, so we took a bus downtown. When we got off, we had no idea where we were, so I asked someone for directions. He completely ignored me. Now, thoroughly intimidated and very lost, my friend and I started walking away from the bus stop when this big black guy started walking towards us. As if I wasn't freaked out enough, I keep watching, now completely sure he was deliberately walking towards us, and see him lift up his hand. He then goes by my friend, right as we're passing him, and gives him a high five. I think it was The most awesome thing I've ever seen.    Btw, that same day I bought an old star wars backpack for a buck off some lady, which was undoubtedly used for carrying weed (You could tell by the smell), and saw three girls go topless (no bras) on stage a smack dab in the middle of an outdoor, public square. Definitely the most amazing day of my life.|`|y2iinfHiaa	The most weird is also embarrassing so I'll say about the next.  To me it's weird when especially a female stranger walks upto me or we've just met they comment how beautiful I am.  When a guy says it it almost ok.  It has happened at least once.  I think it's weird coz I wouldn't do it.I don't even tell my friend they are even after knowing them for so long.|`|HcjCdLehaa	I am not sure...|`|mRuA6KLSaa	They came up from behind me and humped me, but hes like.... my best friend and ive known him for a few years.

Make everyone promise not to tell them until you say so, or the set up is thru. (threaten them if you have to) You just have to be devious, and malicious. Think like the enemy, and be creative.

wHP3NPPHaa	Fake it until you make it! There's really no secret or anything to being outgoing. Just practice, practice, practice! After a while of being pretend outgoing, you'll soon realize that, that's who you're starting to become. You'll feel more comfortable with yourself. Just take a chance and step out there.|`|Lc54UYhXaa	just start talkign to people more. you should find people who have the same likes as you so u guys have something to talk about and relationships can build.|`|dwAyEcaUaa	If you have access to theater classes, I would suggest those.  I took those in high school and they helped me so much!  I became a completely different person.    It may be difficult at first, but if you have a good teacher and are willing to finally come out of your shell, its great!    Also, the more confidence you have, the more likely you will be to come out of your shell.  So this may mean exercising, or eating right, or doing something that makes you feel good about yourself.    Good luck!|`|lmWlVh5kaa	Wanna be outgoing? great, here are some tips;  -foster your curiosity about people,  -Make it a point to smile at people. It can be difficult with strangers but  when you meet people for the first time, in a special ceremony, party, etc, just a smile makes the person feel really comfortable with you and conversation kicks off without strain.  -Ask people questions; This is how you get to getting along with people  easily. Give your self the goal of asking one question per day to someone new. this will trigger conversation  -give people compliments; This is something very important. Almost everybody wants to be complimented in life. We do things to please ourselves but subconsciously, the things are actually done for people to see and appreciate. eg," that is a lovely shirt!, goes with the skin  color"  -Make it a goal to talk to a few strangers everyday. sometimes its easier talking about certain things to people you do not know than those who already know you and your flaws. The more friends you make, the more confident you will become of yourself.  -Laugh out loud when necessary, if someone cracks a joke about something, give yourself the pleasure of laughing, it makes you feel relaxed and free to interact with people.If you can make people laugh as well by cracking jokes, that is a plus.  with these, you need to constantly practise and sooner or later, your will realize how outgoing you are becoming.After Everything, Have confidence in yourself, sometimes people are shy because they think they are not the best.make yourself the best, Do not think that because Paul or Peter are very outgoing, they are the best, they are not, they are just painting a picture of themselves.Actually they even think that you are better than they are and you do not know it. open up and be outgoing and marvel at how best you were without a clue   Good luck

ZyGyDLsDaa	It is rather obscure, but I've seen it and even have a copy of it. I also have read the novel because I was so impressed with the movie; our library has a copy, but I have yet to purchase my own. I do agree with you that it's a wonderful film, and it's sad that so few people seem to know about it. I was truly surprised by the ending, as I expected tragedy.     So, here's one person that agrees with you completely! I've even placed it on many suggestion lists here at Y!A Movies.    Hugh Grant looks so young! Wasn't he "Hughie" then? I'll have to look into that. // According to IMDb, he was Hugh then, so my memory is playing tricks on me.    You also might like "Michael" (1924), starring a very young and surprisingly handsome Walter Slezak.

LldVBFEYaa	I think for it to be good rap there are a lot of qualities it has to have   but if i had to choose one i would say the flow of the rappers voice over the beat...cuz if it doesnt flow the lyrics dont matter its just not worth listening to|`|mZOt8oURaa	Gotta have the love and be able to grip the mic!|`|oJfBZ8wOaa	i just saying things that people can relate to|`|Cp6ACouDaa	Your wrong its gotta be the B****'s and ho's..........|`|xUhAqctjaa	The Beat, everything else is secondary.|`|AA12116276	I think it's the artist's skill, then the actual lyrics. To me, the essence of rap being good should be first and foremost whether or not someone can truly rap. You see more and more that anyone can grab a mic and get a record deal. Like someone said, some of that is just the beat behind the music; some is being famous in some other way (i.e. Kevin Federline). The key is whether or not you're an artist that should make someone hear your flow and not be able to realistically say "anyone can do that, it's nonsense." A group like Bone Thugs N Harmony makes me see what's artistic about rap. The vocal style of someone like 2Pac makes me see what's artistic about rap. Unfortunately, these things don't exist in a lot of modern rap.|`|ineX6nyEaa	LYRICS! end of question|`|pueeMH6gaa	"good rap" is an oxymoron.|`|BxXXh5qNaa	Its nonexistence. If it MUST exist, then the answer is the rendering of words such as "important" as "impotant," etc.|`|0o8csqmuaa	1. The beat (gotta be something I can move my head too)  2. The fluid (how well you can go with the beat)  3. The hook (is it inspiring, is it hot, booty bumping....)  4. The lyrics ( At least spitting something about the hook and rhyming)  5. The message ( not the same as lyrics, lyrics, to me, is just rhyming words that are big and making them sound good, the message however, needs to be clear, whether its about the club, rims, poverty, the street, etc...)    This is what makes a rap song. Personally I get tired of hearing about how baller rappers are, but hey if it sounds good, I can over look that....On the other side, some rappers can be rapping about some real things, but everything else is boring, so I dont like the song....|`|kP0JGI1waa	A great rap song has a strong hook that doesnt get old after a few minutes, but even more key is the vocal delivery.  It has to be meaningful, powerful, and interact with the hook.  I personally enjoy all forms of rhyme and metaphors, I am not too particular as long as its smooth and not cheesy at all (sometimes pop culture references can get cheesy).  A model song would be like The World Is Yours by Nas.

ea0b5BzBaa	When Anna wakes up she follows a trail of blood outside to the dumpster where Rachel's body is lying in (what appears to be) a black trash bag. Alex appears, covered in blood, telling Anna she did what she had to. Anna's father arrives shortly after, but when Anna tries to explain what happened her father tells her Alex has been dead since the fire and asks her what she has done. It is revealed that Anna is the one covered in blood and holding the knife. A series of flashbacks reveal that every conversation Anna and Alex had was imaginary, Anna killed Matt because he knew what really happened on the night of the fire: Anna arrived home to find Rachel and her father having sex. Disgusted, she went to the boathouse to fill a watering can with gasoline so she could burn down the house. She did not shut off the faucet all the way, and when Alex arrived she knocked over a lantern. The boathouse exploded, killing Alex and her mother. Anna was arrested and institutionalized once again. It is revealed that the other mental hospital inmate, Mildred Kemp, was the nanny who killed the children, which is where Anna got the idea. The psychiatrist comes by to see Anna, and she tells him "I finished what I started," meaning to return home and kill Rachel. Standing in her room with pearls in her hand Mildred Kemp says "welcome home" to Anna who smiles back at her and the movie ends.|`|AA11314600	How about a spoiler warning in you question???  I have had more than one movie ending ruined for me on here because of questions posed in this manner.|`|MrDNaxYAaa	Okay so the night Anna lit the boat house on fire was the night Anna slit her wrists and prob became mentally ill. She came back home 10 months later and still in her mind thought that Alex was still alive which in fact she wasn't. The Melinda person did in fact kill those 3 kids so Melinda prob told Anna about how she killed the kids because remember she told Anna when she was leaving "Who will I tell my stories to?". So Anna came home with the Melinda thing in her mind and kind of applied that to real life and imagined her dads fiance as actually Melinda Kemp. Anna was in a half and half world. Anna applied her senile thoughts to real life and pictured her life like that. About Anna's boyfriend he did inin factgo visit her to tell her what really happened but when he told her she was in dis-belief that she had killed her mother and sister so she threw him off the rocks. Get it now?|`|I9GeXQxYaa	Wait, ok-I get it now...but what why did the kemp girl have the necklace?   And the step mom lady had it too?  are they the same people?|`|7FRitj9aaa	ok we were confused last night too,now i get it...kemp was anna's roommate(so imagine she had probably told her lots of stories) thats why she said who will i tell my stories to. the stepmother was actually innocent.she wanted to be a mother to anna, thats why she said at the end (now u have taken that from me because she killed her)anna did not realize that her sister alex was also killed the night of the fire.(anna was BLOCKING what she wanted ,and SEEING what she wanted). if you notice anna was the only person who actually talked to alex. when anna went to the police and told him what the stepmom had did to alex he knew she was crazy because he knew that alex had died in the fire along with the mother. (of course she will have needles, she was a nurse. so she came to calm her down) i believe the pearls was just a coincident.  anna killed her boyfriend because he saw what happen the night of the fire and when he told her she became angry and pushed him off the cliff.As for the Wright children, (mildred kemp was the one who killed them,she was their nanny and had an affair with their father). the stepmom changed her name because she had a prior bad relationship and changed her name to hide from her ex.  At the end is when anna realized that her sister was dead was when she said to the father alex killed her the father said your sister died a year ago.   i hope i helped some.|`|YIEkNCxBaa	This was such an awsome movie! I loved it. I liked how it doesnt give you all the answers, and you'll probably have to watch it twice to fully understand it. Which will increase DVD sales...SMART....|`|6e2NzNpJaa	I have the same question about the necklace - how did Mildred even know Rachel had it? How dies Rachel tie into the whole thing for Mildred if Rachel was innocent??|`|y9gmuPw9aa	wait, but why did Anna have the watering can full of oil in the first place? that's a little random.....

Okay, if you're in the US or Canada, you will be able to see it any time after 2:00AM CT on the ABC or CTV website (actually not sure on the CAD time but probably the same).    And I noticed this past Saturday that they reran the show - I want to say it was maybe 7PM here in Chicago, but since it was already in progress I'm not really sure.|`|dMBSE8ilaa	No, well if you want to know what happened... after that part, Sawyer and Julia saved Daniel before the girl could do anything to him, and John made his way to the others' camp and "Jones" wanted to shoot him before he said that he knew Jacob, Richard called him Widmore and Locke was shocked that he was Charles Widmore! John told Richard who he was and wanted to know how to get off the island there was another flash before Richard could tell John how to get off the island. Charlotte had a bad nosebleed and passed out.    Also Richard didn't believe John and so he told him to go to his birth, which also explains the other episode where Richard was at John's birth.  I don't know if you saw it, but they said they were in the year 1954. I love Lost!|`|YIcBd569aa	no, sawyer and juliet showed up and pointed a gun at the girl and juliet told everyone to just drop you guns. and so they did, and the girl said to faraday " so are they from the future too?" and sawyer said " you told her?" then they cut to locke and alpert and locke explained everything to alpert and just before alpert could tell locke how to get off the island there was another flash. you can also try to see it at www.tv-video.net|`|tK9vi25Daa	no..sorry that must suck.. hopefully it goes up on youtube    mine? http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|FoMEhtQ8aa	No, didn't happen here.

He is young, and an other.  Remember when the one guy out of 2 guys had Daniel, Sawyer and them trapped by gunpoint?  The one guy was going to talk.  Then the other snapped his neck and ran back to camp?  That's Whitmore. Desmond goes to see the old whitmore of the present and gets Daniel's mom's address.  And back on the Island that red headed girl..has like a seisure and fainted...by the way did u see when Daniel told her he loved her?  He is in love with her.  I think he caused her sickness somehow.  Maybe he stole her from the past?  Don't know

VsP8t5rbaa	1. Since their strengths haven't been put to the test against each other yet, it's difficult to tell. But if you will remember, Itachi met with Naruto before he died and gave Naruto a bit of his power. I believe that the power he got from Itachi is something defensive that will help him against Sasuke's genjutsu and Magekyou Sharingan. Also, Sasuke is relying solely on his own power and the little power that Itachi passed to him, whereas Naruto has now mastered Sage Mode and even when uses all of his chakra up in Sage Mode, he still gets a boost from the Kyubi's chakra. So in my opinion, I think Naruto is stronger, but it will definitely be an interesting fight since both are so ridiculous.    2. Yes, the 4th is/was Naruto's dad.     3. Well, he mastered Sage Mode which kind of boosts everything since he can draw from outside energy. Also, he can now do a double rasengan and his Rasen-Shuriken can be thrown, so he doesn't have to be in close contact.    4. I would need a specific example to answer this question, but chances are, if his eyes were red, then the Kyub is trying to exert some energy over Naruto.    EDIT: Are you talking about the bell test in Shippuden? If so it starts at episode 3. (Kinda 2)|`|a6fb6708bba705283e524493764398c5aa	1. Now being when? Actually, no matter when, that hasn't been verified yet.    2. Yes    3. That is the farthest that particular jutsu has gone (rasen, btw)    4. When? They aren't like that through all of Shippuden, so there must be a certain time you are thinking of|`|dwu1b36xaa	If you read the manga all the answers are there    1. is really a opinion answer, I think Naruto is stronger honestly    2. Yes the 4th is his dad. It was confirmed when tsunade and Jirya were talking to eachother.    3. SAGE-MODE    4. i have no idea what ur talkings about ^^|`|unVzWzCuaa	1. im not sure saske keeps getting stronger  2. what??  3. no  4. no|`|1cfMOZ36aa	ok do u understand how powerful his rasen shuriken is its insanely strong. but later he learns how to throw it and make it expand in order to hit, also he learns sage mode which basically makes him above hokage level. naruto is now a bad dude....      naruto is at least as strong as sasuke now if not stronger. personally what it has shown of the 2 id say naruto is much stronger than sasuke, but sasuke hasnt fully learned how to use his mangekyou sharingan yet.

5irLdaa1aa	After 'Fault', Olivia went to computer crimes for 2 episodes, 'Fat' and 'Web'. In 'Fat' Elliot had another partner, Blaine, who he got into a fist fight with. Olivia assisted the investigations in both episodes, and became Elliot's partner again at the end of 'Web'. Then there was only one more episode after that to round out season 7.     In the first episode of Season 8 Mariska Hargitay went on maternity leave, so on the show Olivia went undercover in Oregon and, after the first episode, did not appear in 5 episodes. During this time, Elliot was partnered with Dani Beck, with whom he has a brief fling (only a kiss!). Olivia appeared in 'Inflitrated', which was all about her being undercover (she seemed to have a bit of a 'thing' going on with her FBI caseworker, Agent Porter...she has also started eating very healthily), and in 'Underbelly', where she came back and meets Dani Beck. Dani doesn't realise who Olivia is; Olivia sees Dani and Elliot interacting in an intimate way (very comfortable with their interactions) and leaves without seeing Elliot, getting more for more time off from Cragen, and asking him not to tell Elliot she was there. In the end, Dani couldn't handle SVU, so she left. Olivia came back as Elliot's partner in episode 9 of season 8 ('Choreographed'), with things being very awkward!!!    Hope that helps!!! I wouldn't watched the Dani episodes if I were you, they are just too much ;)|`|I7mBG3Dnaa	I think they were only not partners for about 3 or 4 episodes.  Elliot was matched up with that girl officer and they sort of had a thing, they kissed once, but other than that, nothing really important happened...

There are plenty of other people out there that deserve such passionate feelings of hatred more than Miley Cyrus. Why don't people hate on people that have done things that are really atrocious, such as Michael Vicks who kept dogs for dog-fighting.. instead of lame Disney kids?    You children are in for a real shock when you find out that there have been worse things done by humans than being on Disney and having a show that is worshipped by pre-teens.
ucVgUcDvaa	Acne is curable. Acne is not just because you do not wash. There are a few different kinds of acne also. It comes when you are teenager and can come back as a adult.     A mole isn't curable it is a growth that one can not remove without a  surgery of some kind.    Warts are a growth because of a fungus.    I think neither of them are disgusting.

jTOZHpPFaa	If you play an instrument you don't like you may not have the motivation to carry on - and end up not learning anything.    On the other hand, if you switch to an instrument you are keen on learning then you are more likely to be motivated.    Some things to think about though - have your parents invested a lot of money in an instrument and want you to prove you can stick at it a while before buying another one?     If you can show your commitment to learning the trumpet why not do some research on e-bay and find out if you could effectively swap the flute for a trumpet so it doesn't cost your parents anything - show them what you've found and they'll maybe realise that you are quite serious about it.    Trumpet isn't particularly any easier to learn than flute and it's a lot noisier...but then again I think it's better!|`|Wn4tjazIaa	Better to finish taking one step before leaping to the next.|`|558153061d04e09b4ecacfdd6ec9539eaa	So I've Been Playing Flute for  about,5 years, and then about 2  years ago i went into Percussion,  it's better to   finish one thing, and then go to the  next.|`|AA11703652	If your parents are not professional musicians, I'd have to say the music teacher (who is, in fact, a professional music TEACHER) is right.

Mizlm9ndaa	If you're only 14 it sounds like you may actually have some decent vocal power, but you need to learn a lot about control, dynamics, breathing, etc..  You could benefit a lot from lessons.|`|04F4149yaa	Nooo...    I agree with the girl who said:    "It sounded like you were giving birth"|`|07b8313b7096ade2a84057ef85256e06aa	By the sound of the way you sing, you need proper breath support. Singing is all in the breath. It also sounds like you're singing from your throat. Continuous abuse of the vocal folds and singing like that will lead you to no good. It sounds to me like you are forcing the way you sing, which can damage you voice. It also seems to me like that isn't your "true" tone. It sounds like you are trying to imitate someone's style and voice. Sing with your own voice, don't breath from your chest, don't use your throat to sing. Also, try working on your diction. Start with breath support and diction. Then everything will hopefully fall in it's place or fit into the hole a bit better.|`|bB3f4duZaa	Eh no...lets hope you don't end up trying out for American Idol anytime soon.|`|drzN1kkuaa	sorry but no. voice lessons may be needed :/|`|44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	Seriously?

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	A shame we don't hear more of Wim Mertens' music - it's far superior to the music of some other 'minimalists' who shall remain nameless!    I had a good scout around for this but could only find MP3 downloads from Amazon (UK and US) and one very expensive (presumably, out-of-print) CD. I have read that Mertens' back catalogue is to be released by EMI but, in the current financial climate (and the big CD companies are suffering a LOT), I wouldn't hold your breath, unfortunately.    Good luck in finding it.

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	The Night That Panicked America (1975) (TV)?  The true story of the night that Orson Welles broadcast his version of 'H.G. Welles' ' classic ''The War of the Worlds'' on the radio (October 30, 1938). Designed to be as realistic as possible, many people were fooled into thinking that an alien invasion was actually taking place. In this movie version, people like Hank and Ann Muldoon (played by Vic Morrow and Eileen Brennan) were on the verge of killing themselves and their children. But at the very last moment, they heard that the radio show was all a publicity stunt, a hoax.|`|3qrSUE7uaa	Yeah, definitely War of the Worlds. It was based upon a story written by H.G.

4H7ZZf1maa	In the beginning of DragonBall Z, goku is killed by piccilo (goku's idea) when they were fighting Raditz. If you're watching the second Broly movie, then ur seeing goku when he died a second time. The second time he died was against cell. Cell was going to self destruct and kill everyone, but goku used instant transmission to take both of them to king kai's planet before he exploded. But, it didn't work, cell came back, and gohan had to kill him... Goku decided on the idea to not be brought back by the dragonballs to keep villains from coming to kill him and his friends...    Hope that helps

wVO0PNtuaa	Rockabye by Shawn Mullins|`|uBgMPZsuaa	Lullaby by Shawn Mullins    She grew up with the children of the stars  in the Hollywood hills and the boulevards.  Her parents threw big parties. Everyone was there.  They hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper and Bob Seger and  Sonny and Cher.    She feels safe now in this bar on Fairfax.  And from the stage I can tell that she can't let go and she can't  relax.  And just before she hangs her head to cry,  I sing to her a lullaby  I sing:    (chorus)  Everything's gonna be all right.  Rockabye, rockabye.  Everything's gonna be all right.  Rockabye, rockabye, rockabye.    She still lives with her mom outside the city  down that street about a half a mile.  And all her friends tell her she's so pretty  but she'd be a whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while.  'Cause even her smile looks like a frown.  She's seen her share of devils in this angel town.    (chorus)    I told her I ain't so sure about this place.  It's hard to play a gig in this town and keep a straight face.  Seems like everybody's got a plan.  It's kind of like Nashville with a tan.    (chorus)|`|AA10750251	Rockabye by Shawn Mullins, I believe

You can find the episodes on youtube with the original music. Just search richardf921 and go to their profile, theres a playlist for each season    oh and do not judge it based solely on the first episode because it is from the P.O.V. of a sociopath and just introduces everyone...it gets much deeper|`|oq0jpqAgaa	When i lived in london Lemon Party was one of my favorite tv shows.

I know there was contemplation before about changing people (they were seriously considering recasting Jacob, and had actors like Ben Barnes lined up (if you know who this, you were probably shocked too... he's 100% Caucasian!), but I think they resolved that all long ago and have decided on keeping the original cast.|`|DLXKmcG7aa	its not confirmed that she is playing it but even if vanessa hudgens got the part of leah shes not going to be in new moon brecause leah has no part in new moon and i havent heard of india orcutt     by the way it doesnt matter whos playing leah or jane because you cant judge them until after the movie comes out!|`|CaWyn751aa	I went on google earlier because I asked a similar question.

They were considering replacing Taylor Lautner ( Jacob) with another bigger guy ( Michael Copon was one contender) but Taylor was able to gain 30 pounds of muscle.

Vanessa Hudgens HAS NOT AND WILL NOT be auditioning or considered for Leah Clearwater because Melissa Rosenburg did not even right Leah Clearwater in New Moon in the script. Other Volturi character casting rumors were Ben Barnes and people suggesting the blonde guy from High School Musical and the little boy from Finding Neverland and August Rush.|`|AA11462348	dakota what her stupid face  otherwise i have no clue  shes so stupid|`|4qPsEQFlaa	Everyone is staying the same, including Taylor Lautner who plays Jacob. Yes, its official and he's already signed for new moon.

But ive seen interviews with her talking about maybe playing jane.

aleWoJufaa	This movie is not scary like a horror film, but it has some violence (Jeff kicks Hayley in the stomach when he is tied up and she wraps his face with plastic wrap to stop him) and sexual things (Jeff mentions a woman who put his penis on the stove to punish him as a child) which aren't appropriate for kids. I think you can just show kids the trailer!    Hard Candy  A smart, charming teenage girl, Hayley probably shouldnt be going to a local coffee shop to meet Jeff, a 30-something fashion photographer she met on the Internet. But Hayleys ready to have fun, and soon shes mixing screwdrivers at Jeffs place and stripping for an impromptu photo shoot. Its Jeffs lucky night - until he passes out.    In theaters: April 14, 2006  Rated: R    Here's the trailer site: http://www.apple.com/trailers/lions_gate...  -------  Amazon.com  The supercharged possibilities of a single set and two amped-up actors are explored in Hard Candy, a twisted cocktail with a poison kicker. After a flirtatious encounter in an online chat room, two people agree to meet for coffee: a 32-year-old man (Patrick Wilson) and a 14-year-old girl (Ellen Page). They quickly advance to his house, and just as quickly, the apparent pedophilic seduction morphs into something else entirely. After the tables turn, Hard Candy becomes a tale of revenge and torture that might have tempted a filmmaker like Park Chanwook. Here, first-time feature director David Slade opts for a slick look that stays close to the actors, and you can't really blame him--this movie is like a conceptual, more-than-slightly unbelievable off-Broadway play, a showcase for actors and "controversial" ideas. Those actors are strong: Patrick Wilson (Angels in America, Phantom of the Opera) is every bit as creepy as he needs to be, and Ellen Page has nothing short of a triumph. The Canadian actress was around 18 when she shot the film, but looks like an adolescent, which makes her authoritative wrath all the more shocking to witness. The provocations of Hard Candy sometimes seem arbitrary or forced, but Page's electrifying performance can't be denied, or dismissed. --Robert Horton|`|OzfprFaWaa	Hard Candy|`|23bfaff7099da45b823821ce97868c17aa	Dateline NBC with Chris Hansen.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Robot Jox (1990)  starring Gary Graham, Anne-Marie Johnson, Jeffrey Combs, Ian Patrick Williams, Jason Marsden, Carolyn Purdy-Gordon  IMDb synopsis:  Fifty years after a nuclear war, the two superpowers handle territorial disputes in a different way. Each fields a giant robot to fight one-on-one battles in official matches, each piloted by a man inside, known as robot jockeys or jox. The contest for possession of Alaska will be fought by two of the best. The conscientious Achilles fights for the Americans. Opposing him is a Russian, Alexander, a ruthless and bloodthirsty adversary who has killed his previous nine American opponents. With a traitor feeding the Russians secret weapons information and new, genetically-engineered jox looking to take his place, Achilles faces obstacles at every turn in the hardest battle of his life.    There is a sequel  Robot Wars (1993)  aka Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars  starring Don Michael Paul, Barbara Crampton, James Staley, Lisa Rinna, Yuji Okumoto, Peter Haskell  IMDb synopsis:  In the year 2041, the rebel Centros are a plague to the survivors of the great toxic gas scare of 1993. A renegade Megarobot pilot and an archaeologist must team up (despite personal differences, a reluctant romance, and official pressure to cease and desist) to thwart the Centro's attempts to resurrect a hidden Megarobot, with which they can challenge the prevailing order.|`|SlizbMMVaa	I agree sounds like Robot Jox... fun cheesy movie!

8E59Idahaa	well yes...and no...    1.you need to pronounciate your words more  2. work on your breathing  3. myb try to sing a little slower  4. try it with an instrumental  5. start with really easy songs   6. warm up! not only will you be warming up yout vocal cords but you will learn how high and low you can go and your comfort zone    wasnt the worst i've heard tho so dont feel too bad!  and you were sick so yer...    just keep practising and see where that takes you!    xx|`|4BKmxPcPaa	WOW...THAT WAS AWESOME. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL VOICE. YOUR VERY TALENTED AND BLESSED WITH A GIFT FOR SINGING. GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR MUSIC CAREER...|`|WJdPXvg1aa	hey there, to be honest your not completely bad, my suggestion would be to practice more on your breathing and tone quality which can easily be rectified with some exercises, i suggest watching Eric's youtube videos which will cater for that kind of thing just type in ''eric arceneaux". hope this helps, have fun with your singing!|`|1VpWaQknaa	Really good, but you need to work on pronunciation a bit more. Your voice is great, it's just hard to understand you sometimes.|`|puD9oQ2Saa	you have a decent voice...its not incredible but it's good.    i think you should work on ur annunciation... make sure that everybody can understand the words that ur singing.    maybe open ur mouth a little more.    if ur gonna sing. sing it loud and proud.    you have potential. don't be shy.    just let it out. never know what ur capable of until you try.    try to sing a song where you really connect with the lyrics.    ur audience should be able to hear ur emotion when ur singing    bear ur soul through ur songs.|`|Bqpk2yZGaa	yea that was pretty good especially since you were sick!|`|QsCPOHAraa	Your voice is a little too nasal. You're singing mostly from your throat and head. Try bringing your voice up from deeper down in your body-- your chest, your stomach even. Do some breathing exercises too, this will help you project from deeper down.|`|AV0eejfLaa	you can kinda carry a tune but you don't have a good voice sorry|`|04F4149yaa	You can, but just not well.|`|q8YJYqtcaa	You definatly have alot of great potential in you. with background music it would be better i think. keep practicing!!!|`|7p2IknBOaa	Perhaps, if you learn how to enunciate and perhaps take some lessons.  You sound really monotonous though.  Try a different song.
xvEthutOaa	1. They needed to get under 1 minute  2. Cool Runnings...Peace be the Journey  3. He put weights in the front of the American sled to make it go down the track faster.  4. Summer Olympics in Seoul  5. He kissed his lucky egg!  6. They were trying to act just like the Swedish team and therefore they choked.  They changed it by remembering where they came from and what they were there to represent...hence the slogan "feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, get on up, its bobsled time!"  7. They were supposed to go to the summer Olympics for the 100 meter dash which is the track event.  8. Junior tripped and ended up knocking over two people who would eventually turn into his bobsled teammates.|`|oOSNI3wbaa	"want to kiss my egg"?|`|23bfaff7099da45b823821ce97868c17aa	1. Don't know. try IMDb  2.They named the sled Cool Runnings which means peace be da journey  3.He put weights in the sled to make it go faster  4. Olympics were in Calgary in 1988  5. He kissed a lucky egg  6. They took forever getting into the sled. they practiced more (running on ice, practiced turns in the bathtub)  7. Track. I think 100m. Junior tripped and fell and Yule and Darice fell too. They all lost

4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	There are a few possibilities.    1. The band is cool and invited a few fans to just hang out after a show. I don't think they'd be on tour with the band.  2. Groupies.|`|Gy5OV6CZaa	The correct term is "Roadie" not fans. A friend of mine is a roadie because he is dating the singer of a local band from Baltimore. So you have to know people.

kP0JGI1waa	It was a Sigur Ros song (if you are talking about the same one that I am) but I am not quite sure which one.  Great band, though, I would definitely check out their music vids and you'll probably stumble across it.  Sorry for not being more exact.
8nGgjTgJaa	You should do some kind of poll of the students at the school.  Ask what they listen to, not just one group but all groups.  Make flyers and post everywhere.    Find some local bands to be on the show once a month.   Contests for movie tickets, bowling, skating, etc..     Things like that might help. Make some kind of posters and put up around the school. Let everyone know your there.    I hopes this helps alittle.  Good Luck    earthangels720|`|i4ri6gmRaa	All of the above.   You really need to advertise tho. Maybe even put an add in the local paper. The school might be able to help out with costs. Maybe one night a week do a top 20 or something. Get a flyer or questionaire out to students allowing them to request and that will be your top 20.    You could have a different genre each night. Then they who prefer one will listen on the designated arvo.    Good Luck
eblcLGubaa	Imagine that the people who are assessing you are just normal people. This is kind of the theory behind picturing them in their underwear, but you can also imagine that they are your friends, or just strangers whose opinion doesn't matter. You just have to not care what they think of you - which is really hard. Looking at the back wall can often help, as well as focusing as if there is someone at the back of the room. Not only will it help with stage fright, but projection as well. Hope this helped!|`|07b8313b7096ade2a84057ef85256e06aa	I know what you mean. It's happened to me. I THINK I might be slowly getting over it though. I'm good at stage presence, but with singing it's a bit different. I can hit higher notes no problem by myself, but with people listening in or being watched to do it, I have a bit trouble due to the nerves. For auditions, I recommend you practice in front of an audience to get the "feel" of an audition. Knowing your piece thoroughly also helps.|`|AA10565295	You're good at acting right? Cold reads? Then imagine it as your cold sing. Your character is so happy about this or that that she absolutely has to sing about it. Or do a silly song if you're scared to be laughed at. Or if you really want to cry, do a sad song and cry it out. Then they think you're just doing even more acting.|`|XeRkdcPCaa	I am the exact same way!!!!!!! i am awesome as an actor and love every second. I always forget what to say when in up auditions.   My tips are  A. REHEARSE REHEARSE REHEARSE!!   Practice makes perfect, and if you practice a ton you will do good.  B. Look up above where everyone is sitting, so you cant see anyone and therefore, you wont get nervous.    C. If that doesnt work, you need to get someone to critique you honestly, and work on what they say.|`|8E59Idahaa	rehearse!!! every spare second you have  you can never rehearse enough.  the more you do the better you will be.    i suck at singing in front of people so that's kinda the same as you  and i find that if i pick a few places and a few people to look at in the audience then its easier.    Also another good thing is to keep in mind its no big deal for the people watching, its just another person doing their thing. If you have talent they'll love you, if you don't they'll just forget you.    so i hope that helps.    xx

WchfVMsPaa	Well it's supposed to be a prequel to the other two Underworld movies so technically you don't really need to. But watching the other two films you learn about the main characters and their struggles and the way things are between the lycans and vampires in present day.|`|oOSNI3wbaa	no not really since its the prequel to the first one. so if you watch rise of the lycans first then underworld, then underworld: evolution, you should be fine in understanding it all.|`|e0338b9bb1dd97eb01a44cc65f8d7e7aaa	no   u will be fine it stands up by itself quite well  it may give u a taste to wathc the other 2 afterwards though   enjoy, as my wife and i both did.

Did I mention I got my senior citizens discount when buying these?|`|WD9vYTTmaa	Sometimes 5 minutes, sometimes an hour......lmao      :)|`|WchfVMsPaa	5 minutes tops. If it matches and it cleans and I can fit it I wear it.|`|ERgL2Dhpaa	not even 10 minutes|`|Rh3vkL8Faa	if everything is right in front of the closet, not long. but if i want to look really interesting maybe 30-45 minutes.|`|LldVBFEYaa	bout 10 sec.|`|eywxi2HPaa	maybe at the most like 30 minutes|`|3vDG1Fh2aa	ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  like one or 2 tries.  3 max|`|AA10837394	10 minutes!|`|YCICrIKyaa	About a minute. I'm not an average girl I guess.. I just wear what I think is comfy and it normally consists of a pair of jeans and a T-Shirt. Half the time I don't even look at what I'm grabbing off the hanger. I just reach for it.|`|fU4pOpeHaa	like 10 minutes. (my room is messy hard to  find stuff)|`|GblxshkTaa	Don't even get me started...  Once I actually started earning money and buying clothes, it usually takes no time at all, because I have enough clothes to form a simple rotation.  I just pick out what I haven't worn in a while.    Before I had a good selection, I would spend a long time, probably an average of 25 minutes choosing in the mornings, and a lot of "nothing-to-wear" meltdowns in between...    Scary but at the same time,  if I'm wearing a cute-in-my-own-opinion outfit I will be in a pleasant mood all day. :)    Have a wonderful day.|`|kfNBVZH6aa	welll i know the clothes that i have you know so i just pick it out in my head and grab it put it on! haha|`|sCFSmATMaa	maybe 10 minutes|`|HQuDp6vqaa	depends on where i am wearing it, but not long. I usually know what I am in the mood for when I open the closet door!|`|UY2CPmroaa	eh. it depends.  if i'm really tired,, i just kinda throw on whatever.  but if i really want to look good i pick out my clothes the night before.  usually 10-15 minutes :D

But, that's apart of being a free spirit I guess.    =)|`|3YdDpReTaa	I agree with you, definitely Sagittarius.  My friend is one and his house could be burning down and he'd be kicking back in a recliner chair.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	Pieces - water sign, artistic and determined they do calm very well.|`|55bffae43f7b7cfbd5b53cdc525c5a75aa	leos and geminis. all leos and geminis i know are pretty good about jokes and they just dont care much about what happened as long as they could reach their goal|`|dprURFLxaa	Aquarius...we have a very open mind and 'live and let live' attitude.|`|9564ae87b0958092aa7cbd48f13f7a24aa	Sagittarians aren't usually laid-back; in fact, they are supposed to be a pain in the @ss. Not that they are a bad sign, of course. They just tend to be up for new challenges, and love freedom. They tend to keep trying new things as excitement in life (but then again, who doesn't?) Don't base judgements on sun signs, because these are the signs that have the weakest effect on people!     But if you insist, you should stick to Libra for a relaxed personality.  As a Libra you should be the most laid-back sign. Libras tend to be charming, artistic, and peacful.   Taurus may also be a good sign as well. As they do not like change much, they often tend to make the best of what they've got, and are calm when things remain the way they are. They can get furious, but it is rare that you see that side of them. They tend to be relaxed, but provoke them with serious change, or influence their ideas and they will lash back. But overall pretty easygoing.  wow, didn't realise how long my answer was XD! Sorry!

pbTvZybJaa	Sami went to see EJ at the DeMira mason to tell him that she was pregnant, but no one answered the door so she went to the back door.  She saw Nicole and EJ getting it one in the living room so she went to leave and saw the Killer shoot the mayor and then he point the gun at Sami.  She through her purse at him and managed to get in the back door. Nicole didn't believe her, EJ did and Nicole went to leave and tripped on the body.      Abe is now the mayor and Bo is the commander. Theo (Abe and Lexie's kid) has autism.  Chelsea gave apart of her organ to save Bo (her dad) and then got sick from it and can no longer have children. Lucas went to jail for shooting EJ, on Sami and EJ's wedding (that's a long story, she was doing it to keep her family safe).  Lucas is dating Chloe and are planning to get married, but shes cheating on him with Dr. Dan (she sleeps with everyone). John lost his memory again but is getting it back.  A therapist tried to kill Marlane, John jumped in the way and has lost felling in all but his head.  So he and Marlane are going to Europe so he can get treatment.  Belle and Shawn are together Shawn knows Claire is his and the have gone to sail around the world.    You can watch episodes on youtube.com or read recaps of episodes on http://prevuze.blogspot.com/ (you can go back are far as Jan 2005)|`|gxl6oBpJaa	She saw the killer shoot the mayor of Salem. He knows she saw him so she went into witness protection to hide from him. Rafe is her FBI bodyguard.|`|EioOPbzbaa	Sami went to the Dimera mansion to tell EJ she was pregnant when she walked around the house and heard EJ and Nicole talking about her being pregnant.  Sami rushed away and when running by the front door she witnessed a hitman shooting the mayor.  She stopped and looked right at him and they looked at each other, so he knows she can id him.  Hitman was hired by Stefano to shut mayor up because he was publicly giving Lexie and Theo a hard time.  Sami was immediately put into witness protection, so EJ has no idea she is pregnant and that is why Nicole is after her baby, it is EJ's.|`|Ho4xK8DDaa	Sami witnessed a murder, the mayor of Salem was killed by the DiMera mansion and Sami witnessed it.  For her protection and the protection of her family, she was put into witness protection. She had 2 guards, Hilda and Rafe.  The killer killed Hilda for not disclosing whereabouts and the killer is now trying to get the information from her other guard Rafe.

EtstG6TMaa	-Why Why love is good (has the same characters as devil beside you)    yea They kiss again (ISWAK 2).. its good.. worth watching... though at one point you might feel like stopping because its so sad.. but it'll get happy again don't worry =)     and for boys before flowers there's 3 versions     -japanese (Hana Yori Dango, hana yori dango 2, and hana yori dango final( i think that's what its called, its a movie though, like the end) its good    -the taiwanese version is meteor garden though i heard that only the first one is good    -and boys before flowers korean version.. i haven't watched it yet.. but the plot doesn't seem that good.. and the charadon'ts dont look all that hot.. but try it out maybe it'll be good)    Brown Sugar Macchiato - romance and comedy its good    Romantic Princess - REALLY GOOD my favothere'stheres comedy in it too    and im currently watching 18 jin bu jin its funny, though not as much romance as you'd like it to have its like girls vs. boys highschool kinda    so hopes this helps|`|7SPakLqzaa	If you want more TWDramas, you can try:  Rolling Love  Invincible San Bao Mei  Love or Bread  Why Why Love  Romantic Princess    Some JDramas:  Attention Please!

Check out Princess Returning Pearl I and II (in Part III only one cast member remained of the four main ones so I never watched it).    Basic summaries from IMDB:     Part 1- "This was the series that brought Vicki Zhao to fame all around Asia. Starring as the cheerful, energetic and adorable Xiao Yan Zi, Vicki managed to capture the audience's heart with her portrayal! Generally, the series is about a street girl, Xiao Yan Zi, who in a mix-up ends up as a Princess (officially titled Huan Zhu Ge Ge) instead of her sworn sister (played by Ruby Lin). The adventures continue as Xiao Yan Zi tries to adjust to palace life, falls in love with the fifth prince (played by Alec Su), makes enemies with the Empress, and all the while trying to give her sworn sister back the title of Princess."    Part II- The second series continues with another story about a Mongolian Princess named Xiang Fei who enters the palace bringing loads of drama for Xiao Yan Zi and her sworn sister (who has regained her title by this one). The love also grows between Xiao Yan Zi and the fifth prince    These summaries are very basic and don't capture much- check out the Wikipedia entries for a better idea. There are two major couples- Zi Wei (the real princess) and Ar Kun (a high ranking member within the palace and best friend to the fifth prince); this is the really romantic love, love at first sight, soulmates and all that- and Xiao Yan Zi and the fifth prince; this is the funny love we see plenty of hints of but never gets fully resolved until the very end (and I mean the end of part 2).    This is the series that got me started on Chinese dramas. It's an older series (it came out in 1998) and I watched it as a little girl (I'm Chinese American), but it's great. It has everything: Romance, Comedy, Adventure, Kung Fu (that fighting style where everyone's floating in the air- qing gong), Angst, etc.|`|pVSQhdzFaa	what do u mean u have watched boys before flowers every single one from all countries?does that include the korean version?? im wondering if what u mean is that u already watch BBF korean ver. until finished bcuz im dying every week waiting for new episodes to come up.if u dun mind,please reply..

State Capitalism has failed every time it's been tried, so it really isn't a matter of hope for failure. It will happen.    Bill O is OK, but Rush does better research.|`|6y5wgdmHaa	NEITHER!  I don't care what they say, I can't help it, I am sick to death of both of them (and politics in general).  My mom is a political JUNKIE = at least she isn't on the computer = YET!    (I can't even keep track of how many HOURSssss {plural} Rush is on per day - I know he's on at least from 12 to 3pm EVERY day.)    BUTTTTT: I am agaiinst censorship and they are trying to kick Rush off the air.  I believe it's our innate right and I know its our Constitutional right to speak freely.  Rush, O'Reilly, and the rest of them can say whatever they want to without fear of reprisal and Mom can listen to it until the city blacks out as long as we live in the USofA.  When we have to shut up {and are still required to "put up", as in taxes, etc.}, then I'm either revolting or deserting - I hope its  1.|`|fSRqz7aYaa	RUSH LIMBAUGH FOREVER!!!!|`|eG53oROJaa	you are taking rush out of context, what he has said is he hopes his policy fails, rush never said he hopes obama to fail.  all i've ever heard him say is that obama seems like a nice guy|`|J9j9B8BAaa	Rush.  I love Rush.    Rush for President!!|`|rovxgyiRaa	I can't stand Rush Limbaugh.

If they were so touched just by listening, what more when the voice they listen to takes on human form, dances like he does and breathes the same air as they are breathing at that very moment at that very venue?

f0cbdb93d4b45847cd692d6514fa30cfaa	Indie musicians? Don't make too much at all--they are more likely to travel together in their own van and stay at the Motel 6. Indie of course means 'independent'. Once you get popular, sure you can make more. But when you get big, some big label will sign you up, give you loads of money and you will no longer be independent!    The Offspring once (and maybe still do) have the biggest selling indie album of all time.

aB1U7rHmaa	I went to a taping about a year and a half ago.  They didn't entertain us between the breaks.  Stephen drank some water and had his make-up touched up.  They put the props on his desk, for the next segment.  It took only a couple of minutes.  During that time, some guy named Mark(if i recall right) reminded us to keep the energy up and laugh extra loud.  They did "better know a district", which they have pre-taped.  During that time, Stephen was at his desk, talking with other crew members.   They do have entertainment before the show is taped.  After the comedian is done with his routine, you'll get some Q&A time with Stephen.  Hope this answers your question!!|`|sJ0sLvaPaa	I imagine they step offstage, puff, puff, pass, then return and amuse the audience.|`|uJNrsYpqaa	ive always wondered the same thing  i wonder.......  and if they dont entertain the audiacne wat does the audiance do?  hmmmmm  :D

She totally refuses to wear them and goes for the full support or sports bras now.    I think that, like toasters and irons, the underwire bra has a microchip in it that is triggered off after a certain period of time so it does exactly that... pop out and stab you - so you will have to go out and spend some ludicrous amount of money buying one that doesn't... or at least a cheap replacement to get you through the day.    Hmmm, now I'm starting to understand what all that bra burning may have been about in the 60's... LOL

You like drama but mostly you would like things to be calm.    You both have opinions.    If you both can control each other, not pick at each others failings then things should be exciting.

rqp3CUsCaa	"Fast and Furious" deserves credit for doing the key things well. If your expecting much from anything other than the cars then it's a disappointment, but thanks to Justin Lin this has all the makings of a really thrilling action movie, making this fourth flick in the series a little bit better than its predecessors and a lot of fun. I liked it. This was one of Vin Diesal best movies  9/10    Edit: LMAO!Nick just copied and pasted that long story.|`|2aUZMfSraa	Very good and you can't wait to see it, so hurry up.|`|FxlA9obIaa	Awesome movie... I saw it on Saturday.  There is a lot more story to this movie than the previous F& F movies.... but be warned... it's actually a prequel to Too Fast and Tokyo Drift.... it kind of ties them all together!  YAY!  Paul Walker is drop dead gorgeous in this movie.... A little age did him well!  ;)|`|wck4MHREaa	Although I think that I have somewhat high taste and expectations for films, my one true weakness for movies I enjoy is the "Fast and the Furious" franchise- I liked all the movies, a lot. Even "Tokyo Drift" which in theory should've sucked hard (and I'm sure people believe this), didn't and was still an awesome movie (IMO).     So I saw "Fast and Furious" and really enjoyed it. It's dumb and loud and silly and stupid but a lot of fun. The car stunts were excellent- had me at the edge of my seat (literally) the whole time. Yeah the story's stupid and the acting is amateurish, but I didn't care. The film's only about hot cars and hotter women, and it excelled on both parts.    See it if you're interested in these types of movies; otherwise...take a pass because if you didn't like it before, you won't like it now.|`|0xp9Oobnaa	very good movie and i won't tell you, you must go see it in theather|`|yMc4VcAgaa	BADASS  fast cars, hot girls, lots of action, whats not to like|`|YB2qW0ftaa	After a successful run at hijacking fuel tanks on the highways of the Dominican Republic, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) leaves his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and his gang, as he is now an international criminal. Eventually, Dominic's partner Han (Sung Kang) flees to Tokyo, causing Dominic to also flee. One day, in Panama, Dominic receives a phone call from his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster), who tells him that Letty was just murdered. Dominic returns to Los Angeles, California, to find out who murdered Letty. After Letty's funeral, Dominic asks his sister to take him to the site where Letty's accident occurred. At the scene, Dom finds traces of nitromethane residue that can only be purchased at one body shop in L.A.. At the body shop, he finds one of his old racing counterparts that, after being coerced, leads him to a man named David Park. Dominic finds Park and hangs him out of a window threatening to drop him and vowing to kill anyone that stands in his way of avenging Letty. He receives the information that only through a street race, arranged by Ramon Campos, can he gain access to the man responsible for Letty's death.    Meanwhile, Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker)now an FBI agent, is assigned to track down a notorious drug lord named Arturo Braga. Brian, after chasing down a criminal on foot, receives information also leading to David Park. Both Dominic and Brian, having received the same information are led to the underground entrance race that guarantees them a spot on the team that traffics heroin across the United States-Mexico border. During the race, Dominic and Brian outlast all of their competitors until the two of them remain and head towards the finish line neck and neck, Dominic sideswipes Brian's car ensuring that he comes in first, securing his spot on the team so that he can seek justice on Letty's behalf. Having lost the race, Brian uses his influence at the FBI to ensure that one of the other members on Braga's team, Dwight Mueller, gets arrested for "distribution of methamphetamine," in order to usurp his spot of the team. At a party, Ramon Campos, Braga's right hand man, welcomes them to the team and gives them a GPS that will alert them to where they will begin their race. Dominic ends up in a confrontation with a racer identified as Fenix, the driver of the car that collided with Letty before firing the shot that killed her.    Dominic and Brian both receive the coordinates to meet with Campos and are transported, along with their cars by semi-trailer to the Mexican border to receive the heroin that they are to transport, from there they are to follow Fenix's lead to the other side through an underground tunnel so they aren't seen by the satellite images and forward looking infrared used to monitor the borders. After the transport, Dominic realizes that the drivers are thought of as disposable and that after successful trafficking of the product they are shot and killed in order to avoid paying them. Letty, having been in the same situation was the only driver to get away when they attempted to shoot her, it was the pursuit that led to the car crash and subsequent shooting causing her death. Dom anticipated the double-dealing because of the warning given by Gisele, Braga's liason, in the form of the Spanish phrase "vaya con dios", set his car to explode by discharging nitrous oxide with the spark from the cigarette lighter in his car after he learns from Fenix that he was responsible for killing Letty with no remorse. Brian hijacks one of the Hummers carrying the heroin, escaping the gunfire, and head back to the U.S., where Dominic learns that Brian was contacted by Letty who agreed to infiltrate and collect information leading to Braga in exchange for clemency for Dominic. Brian speaks to his superiors about a plan that he has devised to trade the heroin for Braga if they will pardon Dominic.    An exchange is arranged with Campos, 6 million dollars for the heroin, provided that Braga be the one to deliver the money personally. The FBI is poised to arrest Braga at the exchange site, however, Dominic and Brian both realize that Campos is in fact Braga before the FBI does and the raid is botched. Braga evades capture and flees over the Mexican border out of the FBI's jurisdiction. Brian and Dominic head after him on their own and find him in a cathedral praying for salvation. They kidnap Braga with intent to take him back to the United States where he can be tried and imprisoned for drug trafficking, but after having taken him captive they are chased by Braga's henchmen. The chase leads to the same underground tunnels that they went through in order to transport the drugs into the United States. Once on the United States side of the border, Dominic kills Fenix by crushing him with his car and Braga is finally apprehended by the FBI, as is Dominic.    Dominic is tried for his crimes and, though Brian appealed to the courts on his behalf, is sentenced to "25 years to life withou

7YoSRWQEaa	The movie did a great and very dramatic ending. I thought it was a great representation of the comic book.      He makes himself into a vampire in order to fight off and save the woman he loves. He fights the leader, but then the sun is about to rise so the other vampires start to leave. The man who made himself into a vampire now goes on top of a cliff where he and his love sit together as they wait for the sunrise. She tries to hold him tight as his skin starts dissolving in the air and screams in agonizing pain. Then the sun fully rises and his corpse has become a total ash amongst the wind.    here I will include a clip of the ending.|`|WchfVMsPaa	Eben took the blood from one of the vampires they had killed in the place they were hiding out and injected it into himself.

BUT, I'd like it if, instead, people just blurted out random uncontrollable obscenities each time they sneezed. (a la Steve Carell in "The 40 Year Old Virgin" when he's getting his chest waxed). Everyone would go around sounding like they had Turrets. And, I don't care who you are, that's funny right there.    ;p|`|82e89513500dd0dd5aacda7afa3fb4bdaa	My sneezes are very large, it hurts me to control them so I don't . I just let my lips flap and spray spittle every where, Just kidding I do cover my mouth to make sure I don't get it on those around me.  What ever sound comes out is what you get, unless it is a fake sneeze and you are in the process of covering something up, then you make it sound how ever you want.

FZKFLTyLaa	Here's what I plan to post in an April Fool's contest in a local paper :    The Ohio Department of Natural Recources has announced that 3 lakes in Central Ohio have been selected to host "an in-depth study into carp population controls through the use of fresh-water sharks."    In a recent press release, marine biologist, Holly Falls-Hood stated:    " Due to the rise in popularity of Buckeye Lake as a resort area, many desirable game fish are in serious jeopardy. The populations of large-mouth bass, crappie and many species of catfish have shown demonstrably steady declines while carp populations are multiplying exponentially."    She continues on to explain how younger fish often fall prey to the voracious carp, those notorious inhabitants of shallow waters where other fish spawn seek shelter and safety.    ODNR seeks federal funding and approval from the Federal Department of the Interior for a release of sterilized juvenile sharks, including blue sharks and hammerheads. These fresh-water sharks are known to have a preference for "oily meat" type fish, the carp being chief among Buckeye Lake's species, and the most plentiful.    The experiment is designed to determine whether the sharks will target mostly carp and if they could survive in the cold climate of Central Ohio.    Newly appointed Secretary of the Interior, Compton (Comp) Leet-Fickshen, himself an avid fisherman, calls the experiment "highly creative, and simple to implement." He adds, "In a faltering economy, any additional revenues brought to manufacturers of fishing gear would be a boon to the economy. As families struggle to make ends meet, a tasty, catch-it-yourself- meal can help feed countless millions of unemployed Americans. Carp MAY be eaten under the direst of circumstances, especially if one adds enough lemon during the cooking, but have you PRICED fresh lemons lately???"    A representative from the National Biological Foundation. Darren U. Tabuyett,  was quoted as saying that there would probably be a noticeable decline in the populations of carp in the lake because "the sharks will eat about 9 pounds of fish each per day, more as they get older."    Local officials were said to have protested the experiment, afraid of the hazard it would pose to fishermen and swimmers, but their complaints had been ignored by the federal government. Furthermore, fishermen will be required to release any of the sharks they catch. Possession of shark would result in stiff penalties.  Shark experts advise swimmers to liberally coat themselves in onion juice, mustard or Giorgio cologne as an effective shark repellant.    Many retired ciizens of the Buckye Lake region who reside in Florida during the winter have contacted ODNR with offers of air freighting live sharks for this project, but ODNR is quick to remind them : "Have your shark spayed or neutered!" Local animal shelters have limited facilities for housing and adoption of unwanted sharks.    It is further noted, all sharks will be tagged with GPS transponders,each carrying a solar powered battery, thus enabling a shark recapture program should the experiment prove to be flawed.    World renowned shark angler, Nestor "Papa" Hemingway stands at the ready to fish Buckeye Lake back to its previous shark free-status if needed.    If approved, this plan is scheduled to be implemented on ***April 1.***|`|8IfePMa3aa	The best thing I've done so far: I removed all the toilets from my brother's house, hauled them out to the dive platform 20ft away from shore, and then "misplaced" the boat.|`|gK4gIepZaa	my friend pissed in my cup before|`|zCSUlmmPaa	Heard of it, not done it.

AA11278548	Well, she wasn't a mortician, but it was western, and she was a doctor- Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman? It ran from 1993 to 1997.    From IMDB: "The fifth daughter of a wealthy Boston physician, Michaela Quinn defies the conventions of post-Civil War society by following in her father's footsteps. After his death, 'Dr. Mike' leaves Boston and moves to the frontier town of Colorado Springs, where she finds the citizens less than thrilled by the concept of a woman doctor. While she struggles to earn their trust, Mike's life is complicated by a growing relationship with mountain man Byron Sully, and the unexpected responsibility of raising three orphaned children."    I don't remember too much about it, seeing as I was only 7 when it started and 12 when it ended- I watched some when my parents did. But I do remember liking it.    Someone uploaded the vast majority of the episodes on YouTube- search for it there for a look; or look on SurftheChannel.com it's nice and organized there- link below.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Peacemakers.

Really, she's apologizing. she's trying to make it up to you.  and she's leaving too, and she's being nice by at least saying good-bye, and yet you want to hold a grudge on her for something that may have happened a while ago?  please. learn to forgive and forget. thank you.|`|6qPVGyNQaa	don't be dramatic and get over with it|`|3q3bXWMFaa	CHILD,LET IT GO!!!!!!  wow aren't we acting childish.  if she's apologized and you still won't accept it then who's being a baby about this.....YOU!!!!!!  you'll be surprised at how much your life will change if you let go and let God....think about it.|`|9spU816saa	You need to open the hand and let it go.|`|FYH4aBdeaa	uh NO. it was just an apology letter, its not like it was hurting anybody. you could have easily not read it, or you could just block her email. sorry for being blunt, but its the truth. just be happy that shes not plotting revenge on you or something. if i were you, i would email her back to be polite, even if you hate her. thats just me though.|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	What would you tell them?  That you have a humongous chip on your shoulder and your ex-friend had the decency to tell you "goodbye" in an email and you are reporting her for being decent and for letting a co-worker know she was leaving, which is a totally appropriate use of company e-mail.    If I were your supervisor, I would tell you to stop wasting my time, and get back to work.  By the way, with the attitude you have, your ex-friend is lucky to be moving on, both from the friendship and the job.    I am not trying to offend you, but holding such hateful grudges hurts you more than the people you spend all your time and energy hating!      If you spurn all your friends with burning hate, even after they have tried multiple times to apologize, you must be a lonely, bitter person. Maybe you should try treating people like you wish to be treated.      IF you had tried apologizing to her multiple times to her, would you want her to hate you, tell you to drop dead and if you came 'round she'd report you to H-R?  Somehow, I doubt it.|`|ebc5e2e4098b7079e0c6cfb2ee412605aa	I can't believe you're actually thinking of doing this?  1st, HR will know you're primarily doing this to try and get her in trouble as a last-ditch low blow. It would be hard for them to even take you seriously.  2nd, if she is leaving in a week, HR wouldn't even have time to fully investigate before she is gone. If they process a term form for her, they aren't going to write her up after a term form is already in process.  3rd, you'll be scrutinized for all your past emailings. It is kind of HR's job to eliminate idle employees (haven't you heard of the millions of job cuts in the past year???) Employees who have a lot of time to email will be 'watched' -- or on the mental list of HR.    It was actually a nice thing of her to care enough to say goodbye, and to try and leave on a good note.  You are either 1)  young (professionally immature) or 2)  old and cranky
730505ecff4ca4830fd44af63217fb37aa	It would be really cool if they did. They might since vampires are in right now. But maybe only if a lot of people read it. It's not mentioned as much (unfortunately) as Twilight was in the beginning... I hope it does though! I'd love to see what Erik looks like. :)|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	depends on if more then just one person likes it

Discover your types of songs, your style, and brainstorm what makes you unique. Find little things that make your band unique among every other band out there- and call it that. Don't pick a random name, it won't mean anything. Pick something meaningful that will be special, that way they will most likely take it seriously and treasure it all that much more.|`|rZWcaSrkaa	You have to think about what your singing for, and what your songs mean.

57e7865d60ee7efd9e478c51de8fe911aa	Wee Sing in Sillyville (1989)?  One day, two kids named Scott and Laurie and their basset hound Barney are magically transported into a coloring book! This coloring book is a mystical, magical land called "Sillyville." While there, the kids meet up with Sillywhim, a happy, sing-songy lady who tells them of Sillyville's troubles. The Yellow Spurdurgurgles, Blue Twirlypops, Green Jingleheimers, and Red Bittybooties are all fighting because they do not wear the same colors! Scott, Laurie, and Sillywhim meet up with all of these coloful characters, plus a talking tree, a singing acorn, and the kindly purple-wearing Pasha who all sing songs about themselves. Will the kids and Sillywhim be able to reunite all of the people of Sillyville? You can bet your magic rainbow blower on it! There's also an old Irish song about Michael Finnegan and it goes something like this:    There was an old man named Michael Finnegan  He had whiskers on his chin-igan  They grew out and they grew in-igan  Poor old Michael Finnegan! Begin again...    There was an old man named Michael Finnegan  He went fishing with a pin-again  Caught a fish and threw it in-again  Poor old Michael Finnegan! Begin again...|`|ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	You can watch it on Youtube at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98QDqxo9K...

T.I.:  Never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away  Amazing they ungreatful after all the game I gave away  Safe to say I paid the way for you cats to get paid today  You'd still be wasting days away, now had I never saved the day    Consider them my protg, homage I think they should pay  Instead of being gracious they violate in a major way  I never been a hater still I love them in a crazy way  Some say they sold yah and no they couldn't even work on Labor day    It ain't that they black or white, their hands in areas the shades of grey  I'm west side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away  Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid  I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away    I pray for patience but they make me want to melt their face away  Like I once made them spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away  Been thugging all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break  You would rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away    Rihanna:  You're gonna be a shining star,  With fancy clothes, fancy car-ars.

Articulate  But still would grab a *****  By the collar quick.  Whoever had problems,  They reckonsile  They just holla 'til.  If that don't work  And just fails,  Then turn around and follow 'til.  I got love for the game  But ay  I'm not in love with all of it.  I do without the fame  And the rappers nowadays are comedy.  The hootin' and the hollerin',  Back and forth with the argueing.  Where you from, who you know,  What you make  And what kind of car you in.  Seems as though you lost sight  Of what's important  With the positive.  And checks  Until your bank account,  And you're about poverted.  Your values is a disarrayed,  Prioritized are horribly.  Unhappy with the riches  Cause you pis-pone morraly.  Ignoring all prior advice  And fore warning.  And we might be  Full of ourselves  All of a sudden aren't we?    Rihanna:  You're gonna be  A shining star,  With fancy clothes,  And fancy car-ars.
