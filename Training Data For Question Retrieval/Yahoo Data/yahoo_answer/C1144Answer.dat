ccJ9g9Bpaa	My ears are also at a size 2 and have been for about 2 months. It is wise to sleep with them in, Mine have fallen out at night before, and they began to shrink over night. It can be somewhat painful putting them back in the morning & if you're not careful, you could end up tearing up the inside of your ears. Keep them in at night and keep them secure, because your hole is still small enough, that it can and will try to return to it's original size.|`|u0kK3RUtaa	unless they're self stretching (you play with them or heavy jewelry causes it to stretch) and it becomes lose then there is no reason to take it out. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend has his ear stretched to 18mm.<br>  (2 gauge is 6mm incase you were wondering)<br>  And he sleeps with his in.<br>  <br>  Lol however theres always the chance of an o-ring slipping off in your sleep..no big deal though. |`|Ue5NoJOgaa	I always do, I would just make sure they are good and healed first so they don't close at all

MrizzMDhaa	I use hair removing cream on my face (as in cheeks and chin, not just upper lip) about once a month. I don't even bother buying special 'for face' products but I would recommend that you do at first buy the 'facial hair remover' cream rather than the ordinary and they normally have a 'finishing' cream with them. I'm not especially hairy or anything but, like you, I really don't want that peachy fuzz on my cheeks.<br>  Don't do it just before you are going out as your face is red afterwards and you mustn't stick make up on on top: so-do it the night before, before you go to bed. Don't use on areas of broken skin obviously.<br>  I love the look it gives my face and skin.|`|L2tQ7t6Faa	Yes, but you should be sure it doesn't make you break out with acne, so be sure.

q35B1RNraa	If your parents are more conservative maybe a lip ring would be better, it's more mainstream then a monroe theese days. I have two lips rings that are 14g, a bit big but if you get a 16g or maybe even a 18g it will leave less of a scar, not scar but a slight hole in your skin. your parents might like it a bit better if you used a small piece of jewllery such as a little diamond :D <br>  Lip rings dont hurt that much it's just a tiny pinch for a second. <br>  Hope i helped <br>  Cheers It :D|`|VsLSJ65Paa	I have had my lip pierced twice and have took it out both times because it bothered me too much.  You can constantly feel it and its gets really annoying.  <br>  Nose piercings dont hurt at all since they are done at either 16g or 18g.  <br>  Monroes hurt more than lip piercings because the skin is thicker.  <br>  --<br>  i have scars from both my lip piercings.|`|XGPML3Lsaa	i got my lip pierced it didnt really hurt, only for a second it was so quick!

dae34b4ef56cf9f9a9c29d363b3c4bc8aa	You are doing this backwards.  You don't start tattooing on your own and then try to get into a shop.  You get an extensive art portfolio together and beg for an apprenticeship.<br>  <br>  It is impossible these days to do it on your own. In most locations now there are legal implications.  For instance, in Illinois, you MUST tattoo in a registered studio.  <br>  <br>  With hepatitis and MRSA (and others) on the rise you would be putting yourself and your friends who would let you practice on them at a very high risk - learn to tattoo professionally and safely.  This is a true profession - not a hobby someone just picks up on their own.|`|4vqzkIr4aa	Martini's are good machines and you can't go wrong with them. But what I would recommend for a beginner and is a very nice machine that you can continue to use even when you advnace your skills is a Fowler machine. Are they the best out there, no. But they are indeed the best for the price. They are the most adjustable machines on the market. Or at least the easiest to adjust. If you want to fork the doe for a Fowler Fussion this is also a good selection for you. I have never used one but I have seen artists using them and using the same machine for lining, color packing, and washing. The Fussion seems to be a very good machine. Specially for someone that does not have the cash to purchase 4 or 5 machines to use for different aspects of this art form. You can get a power supply pretty cheap these days and as a beginner the power supply is not going to make that much of a difference. But I am assuming that with this low budget you do not have the means to pick up proper sterilization utensils so I also recommend disposable tubes and what nots. They are not as good as using steel tubes but they will get the job done. Many of us artists do have to use them sometimes also, like when we do pieces at a convention. Most conventions now days require the use of disposable tubes. Also, be sure to pick you up a couple dozen practice skins. They are not real skin of course but can help you get the feel of your machine.<br>  <br>  But I must also agree to building a portfolio before you attempt to learn this art form on your own and gain an apprenticeship. When an artist takes on an apprentice we much rather them have no knowledge at all of doing tattoos so that we can teach them from scratch and not worry about having to break them of bad habits.|`|kCdISEGqaa	Why are you afraid he'll act dumb?  Is it because he doesn't think you should be tattooing with a formal apprenticeship?|`|53e1c3e3cf69dd882ecfbbb50e404730aa	$450 is not going to get you anywhere near all the equipment you will need to begin tattooing<br>  for starters just look up the price of even the cheapest autoclave on the internet.is safety and Hygiene first and foremost.go check it out,you have a lot of reading up to do i′m afraid|`|ZkrGttKaaa	If you want a really good machine, and you've got three hundred to sink into it, the Martini 'headbutt' is a great choice. The large liner is what you want to go with. They're handmade in Italy by Jim Martini, and his crew, iron frames, silver contact screw, 8-wrap solid copper wire coils, and they run like new money. Warrantied for life, they are the best around for your cash. They weigh in at only 6 1/2 ounces. If you need to use it as a shader, you can tune it for that, too. The $500 machines you see on the Martini site are just fancied up headbutts. Get an inexpensive power source from Cam Supply or wherever, they all do the same thing. Type in 'Martini tattoo machines' on your search bar. And, if you need another application, just go with another spring, change it out for a greywash shader, ect. I'm assuming you're an artist, and know about the buisiness and that your friend will help you. You can use a pressure cooker with distilled water for your tips and tubes, etc. , they sell steel baskets, that fit inside. Take care.  P.S. The reason I give honest answers to these type of questions, is that there is a lot of pregidious and jelousy in the buisness. In the early days of tattooing in America, rival shops got burned down; hands got broken with hammers. And the badmouthing of artists by other artists is all still done wearing a halo of self-rightous indignation, while seated on a throne of contempt. A straight answer never hurt anyone. This is a Q&A forum. I sure wish someone had helped me, with the simple questions, when starting out. And that's the name of that tune...

dae34b4ef56cf9f9a9c29d363b3c4bc8aa	Yes almost always.  Keloid scarring is very rare - most raised scars are hypertrophic scars and they respond very well to tattooing...in fact, they seem to soften and the raised appearance diminishes.<br>  <br>  It is important that the scar is healed - not red or pink but white.  It may take a bit more work because scars all do not respond the same way - sometimes it is harder to take the ink, other times it grabs more than the rest of the skin.|`|kCdISEGqaa	It really all depends on the scar.  If it is a small scar yes, if it is a raised scar, called a keloid, no.  Make sure the scar is older, and not from a new injury.  Best to see your artist and ask them about it.  Best wishes!|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	The Yahoo Answers Search Bar works<br>  it does.....I'm not making that up<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_result;_ylt=AvSR2ntLhhm5PITyDWC9tfAQxgt.;_ylv=3?p=tattoo+over+scar">http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_r...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  yes.....as thousands of people have already said...you can get a tattoo over scar tissue<br>  but it will depend on the artist as to how good it comes out|`|bj1qKTYuaa	its possible yes...depending on the scars! from what i know the skin on scar tissue is very different from normal skin, so when it comes to tattooing it it cant be over worked...but at the same time sometimes ink doesn't hold in so well so it may require touch ups more so then regular skin|`|mUhGzVKUaa	oooh hey i want the same thing<br>  if it IS a keloid (raised) try massaging in bio oil or vitamin E oil twice a day<br>  maybe then it will fade<br>  i guess old scars work best<br>  if you really want it done that bad<br>  you could ask a plastic surgeon to re-do your scars, so he/she cuts them and then lets them heal again so they wont keloid.<br>  xx|`|AA12045604	Yes, you can. My husband has a raised scar on his arm that he was able to mostly hide with a tattoo. <br>  (It was a large scar ... probably 4 inches x 2 inches or so, and about 10 yrs old when he got the tattoo)|`|eGMe5qknaa	Our tattoo artist told my husband the only thing he won't tattoo are moles.

AA11893861	first get the hair out of your eyes and show off that beautiful face .tone down the color with a little caramel high lights . maybe a straight fringe bang , and pull your hair back with a little teasing on top and have the ends semi curled Angelina wore it that way to the oscars .

Not advertising means dont put ads in the paper etc. It is her job to get you the samples and do anything else you need to succeed. If she doesn't go over her head and ask for another mentor.

Ztdw7nrLaa	If you are "dominant", then that means you should have some self-confidence, and if you do, then you wouldn't call yourself ugly!<br>  So, just gain some self-confidence and enjoy life! You only live once. <br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|`|Vm9JQ6zSaa	You know that is so true. I dont think it's just ugly people who are expected to be in the background but also average or plain looking people. If they are outspoken they are automatically called an a**hole or a bi**h.

XEcoJnt4aa	Oh boy, I waited till me second. Have a nice day!
2ZsRAxkuaa	Well I used to have three sets of piercings. But as I stretched my first set it started to put way too much pressure on the second set and tore. They started off being a good way apart, and ended up nearly touching.<br>  I took those out, and kept the first and third set. And I've stretched the third set a little too. But not too much, otherwise my ears would look lumpy and very thin. <br>  But thats just my ears. Its all personal really. Theres nothing to stop you. But space them out alot more than you think.<br>  <br>  You'll need to wait quite while before you stretch fresh piercings though. About 6 months before the fistulas happy enough not to tear when you stretch, and then wait a month between stretches after that.<br>  <br>  I have perfectly happy 5/8" and 6g lobes now :)<br>  And am trying to stretch my conch. Tricky.|`|a1GwMzbnaa	I've tried it. I'm not sure what I had in, maybe a 8 or 6 along with my 0s. There's definitely marks of stretching/stress between each piercing/stretched hole. My lobes are rather stretchy too. I wouldn't go any farther than what your ear can supposedly handle.<br>  <br>  Get your second ones pierced at 16g if possible. it will be easier that way.|`|kj2tDGLqaa	Yes, you absolutely can.<br>  Just try to start your other ear off at a 14g. That is the normal piercing needle size they provide you with a piercing studios. A 16g is smaller so why not go with the bigger option they can provide you with. When you get your other ear done wait 4 weeks until you start gauging. Then just go up a size every 2-3 weeks. But, make sure you keep cleaning them on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Also try not go rush gauge, it can cause a blow out. Or you can rip your ear.

lU8e0VQFaa	You got them done with a gun didn't you? Those things are nasty dirty and rip a hole through your ear using blunt force trauma, also, that "cleaning"solution they give you is actually bad for piercings. First of all make sure the back isn't on too tight (for both ears) use some ice to bring down the swelling for the moment, throw your "cleaning" crap away and make yourself a warm sea salt soak (1/4 teaspoon SEA salt, not table salt, to 8oz water).

If the dress is plain, add long drop earring, a few fake silver necklaces, and some fake silver bangles. It's a go with it idea, and the accessories add punch to you outfit.

39ddae07d1a09152ce989a9cacc5e728aa	The difference between the ceramic, or common perms, and the digital perms, is that the heat can be controlled in digital perms, so the rods won't get too hot, and won't end up damaging your hair. Digital perms got its name, because you can control the heat. (It's also called Japanese perms because that's where it all started) In ceramic perms, the curls are more visible and stronger when they are wet, however, in digital perms, the curls are more visible and stronger when they are perfectly dry. Also, the digital perms last longer, and you have to dry it in the way it was curled to maintain the curl. <br>  <br>  The hairstylist at the hair salon that I go to told me, that digital perms are for people who want more volume on the top (which would be difficult with the ceramic perm), for people whose curls leaves faster with a ceramic perm, damaged hair that is harder to curl with a regular one, you don't want to use hair irons/curlers so often, and want to add curls to the tip of your hair. However, the digital perms take 20 to 30 minutes longer than the ceramic perms. <br>  　<br>  I had it done at a hair salon, and I prefer the digital perm! The hair isn't so much damaged afterwards, and for me, it lasted for about 7 months, while with regular ceramic perms, the curls only lasted for less than 3 months.<br>  <br>  As to which looks better for you, it depends on how you want it to look. I added some link on the bottom that shows the result of the digital perm.|`|AA11662697	Ceramic perms dont last very long but dont damage your hair. On the other hand, Japanese perms last months but can really damage your hair. But they give better results.

5jqFrtrwaa	I'm not really answering your question but here goes...<br>  <br>  I had real hair extensions and they are rubbish and wreck your own hair - plus you are talking about ￡300-￡400 atleast for a full head. You are better buying the clip in extensions, you can put them in and out whenever you want and they last for years not months. I have them and even my hairdresser commented on how much better they look than real ones. The best ones I have ever got are from lovehairextensions.com (easy to extend) but Sally's also do them - they are around ￡15 per length and I have 5 lengths.<br>  <br>  I really reccomend them...good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  NO PROBS!! P.S you can take them out to wash them i wish I could take my real hair off to wash it - sooooo handy!|`|x1ZMnllaaa	You can purchase the real hair extensions yourself and then take them to a professional who knows how to apply them.

SUNBLOCK SUNBLOCK SUNBLOCK. And not that silly stuff like Nivea, etc. You have to have a facial sunblock of at least SPF 60 in the summer and it has to be applied every two hours, half an hour before you expose yourself to sun. <br>  <br>  They also gave me a cream containing a sort of mild bleaching chemical which is to be used only at night. You should also use a moisturizer containing vitamin C as it is good for skin discoloration. <br>  <br>  Finally, you can try a weekly microdermabrasion session which will slowly remove the spots painlessly and has the added benefit of smoothing out fine lines and other skin impurities.|`|399f6fc610962c987a2f2028d44c9a95aa	see a dermatologist. if he's not concerned try some gly acid.  it's not painful, but it made my age spots go away.|`|5d0af4f7ec682c93484865429d85411baa	I'd have them checked with a dermatologist, just to be safe.

AA10151329	When your hair is still wet, rub garnier fructis smoothing serum through your hair. Only a little, or it will make it look like a grease bomb went off on your head. Next: flip your head over and brush your hair as you blow dry it. Do this until your hair is dry. After its dry you need to use the cool air setting, most new hair dryers have this feature, and use that for a couple minutes. this "sets" your hair and will prevent it from going crazy. This usually doesnt make it completely straight, so next run ur flat iron over it and ur good to go. I wouldnt recommend hairspray or gels bc they make ur hair hard and arent very good for your hair. Good luck!|`|4cdb82a0c3d6b9a0db3f0b2bb33972d4aa	hairspay it. then straighten it. i have the exact same problem! doesnt it just make you mad?? :)|`|640447919365f9b5be8f3ad382573998aa	1.

When I blow dry mine straight, I use a straightening balm. If I flat iron it, I don't have to do anything extra. I use a Chi brand flat iron, which costs $100+. Sally Beauty Supply sells the generic version of it (which works just as well as the Chi) for $60-70. It gets really hot so it straightens beautifully without the need of products. Good luck!

If your hair is really frizzy or unruly when it is natural, invest in oleorelax liquid by Kerastase and work a small amount through towl dried hair.<br>  4. Dry with a blow drier and a brush so that your hair has absolutely no moisture it it whatsoever.<br>  5. use a ceramic hair straightener to straighten hair completely.  Get a straightener that has adjustable heat settings.<br>  6. use a finishing spray or lotion to finish off.<br>  <br>  If you follow these steps, you should not get frizzy hair after you straighten it.

You pump some into your hand, and work it through your hair before you straighten. You have to use it sparengly, but it does work. <br>  Another product that hepls is REDKEN 12 (align) Ultra-Straight Balm. The link below should take you to their website and you can decided if you want to give it a try. It worked for me, but I get most of my hair products through a cousin of mine who owns a hair supply store, so I have no idea if it would be too costly for you. Depends on what works I guess.<br>  Good luck!
AA11390361	If you're going to go all out blonde and use bleach then also be prepared to eventually cut some of your hair for it will get damaged.  Try some HENNA First-the very ligh blonde-but do a strand test first -mix some henna with warm water to make a creamy paste then coat the hair .make sure you cover every strand-why I'll run a comb through it-then leave on approx 2-1/2 to 3Hours then after you wsh out let it dry or cool blow dry and if you like then repeat on all your hair-after you rinse it all out -use just a tiny bit of shampoo to get all the residue out.Henna will also condition your hair so it will feel and look fantastic.  If presently you condition and it just lays on your hair you are having buildup-get a shampoo thats specifically made to get rid of build up chemicals/enviroment-will say on the bottle  or get Brown  Vinegar(has minerals esp Potassium-White has none) that gets all the heavy stuff out of hair,returns scalp and hair to normal PH, makes hair soft,healthy-kills bacteria made rom sweat etc. If you color over build-up in your hair color will not take as well and can even come out blotchy,streaky and if you use permanent color stuck with it quite  a   while.  Hairbuild up will also make it heavy ,weighs it down and  just hangs for loses movement.  Shampoos,Conditioners found at health food stores and made from nature stuff tend to not leave residue and much better for your hair. Dry hair is also not attractive for has no shine,movement and also breaks and splits much more easily which is then damaged hair and must be cut-no product no mater what it claims can repair split end or damaged hair|`|569a732038592960f6503f6fa0dc2dfaaa	Yeah, it looks wack, Gone.|`|9621e342d44520ec18620ab2fb3f47f3aa	Spike it and leave it alone

ca3601d0d0cd6cd50578b847737233abaa	Well, one reason might be because there is so much money to be made from the sale of shaving, waxing, tweezing, plucking, zapping, and other hair removal products and procedures that it really is not financially worth it to most Health and Beauty Aid companies (i.e. Proctor and Gamble) to produce such a system/product. Remember, companies are all about THEIR bottom line - not your bikini line...|`|714b1cc44059dc948c95bb7c27a75917aa	There is a product called Finipil.  It doesn't stop the hair from growing back, but it definitely slows the process down tremendously. I work at a salon and we usually recommend it to our clients who get waxed.  Until they come up with a cheaper more permanent way, this may be a solution for you.  Good luck.|`|AA10475131	I sooo agree with you!!! You can't do it without thousands of dollars and that's not fair. I'm tired of temporary fixes...because even those add up...Waxing!
0b19a5e108bf9ade78cc517682355b67aa	NO  dont perm it.. you will look like a french poodle.. If your hair is really straight then Use your normal shampoo and rinse out conditioner.  If you wish to enhance your natural texture consider using a texture enhancing product mix like PhytoCurl which helps define curls or Phytobrush which was specifically developed for use in scrunching, blow drying and creating waves.<br>  Rinse well and finish with a cool/cold water rinse which helps to seal in moisture, add shine and helps enhance the hair's ability to form curls and waves. Once your hair has been properly prepared with the styling products of your choice (gel, mousse, cream or similar), use your hands and work from side to side around your head scrunching individual sections. <br>  You have the option to use a blow dryer or long finger diffuser to help set the scrunched sections.  Whether you use a blow dryer or a long finger diffuse, remember to use a cool setting on a low speed to avoid blowing out the newly formed texture. <br>  Scrunching hair is a lot like crumpling up a piece of paper.  To scrunch effectively you need to pick up a section of hair, squeeze the strands between your fingers, and then crumple the ends of the strand up toward your roots, causing it to wrinkle and crinkle.  <br>  <br>  <br>  some people have the hair for it, and some dont.|`|d5d2932031efa991954aa3468bb79f0faa	You need to get a Spiral Perm (professional) ~ They have a way of rolling the hair up a certain way using 1" square sections and having the rods hang out and away from your head to create this look.  You may have to go to a high-end beauty salon to have this done especially if you have long hair.  The other thing you can do is buy a "spiral curling iron" at almost any depart store that will give you the same look.  It appears from the picture that the person on the left used a styling aid (such as gel or mousse) in her hair and then styled.  The same look can be created by putting gel or mousse in the hair while it is still wet on hair that has been previously permed.|`|AA12319961	To the person above me...There are different size rods used when perming hair, not all people end up looking like a poodle unless you ask for a Spiral perm, or blue rods.<br>  <br>  You would probably need a perm if you want it to look curly. It also depends how long your hair is. If it's past your shoulders, putting gel, hairspray or mousse in your hair when it's this long won't work, it'll end up looking straight with a few kinks and a bit stringy. If your hair is around chin length or a little above your shoulders you may be able to do it. The best way I have found to scrunch my hair without it looking kinky is to use a towel after you've put the product in. Because the towel grabs more hair and it'll give you slight waves, verses the kinks you'd normally get from using your hands.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to get a perm, make sure you go to a curl hair specialist, that's what I did and my hair came out fine after the perm, no dryness, fried ends, frizz...only curls. Also make sure your sylist trims your hair right after perming, the chemicals fry your ends and if they're trimmed this won't be as noticeable. And remember not to wash it for at least 48 hours after the perm, to allow your hair to set.|`|ba8c3049c75d8b75c7f64a7638af6373aa	scrunching w/ gel will work|`|c376b9e974942d05853f67020b7b5267aa	Well some peoples hair scrunches easy and some doesn't. You can try scrunching it in your hands with gel or you can get a perm. The person in the picture looks like she has naturally curly hair and she added gel or a curl product.

Mix milk and chopped cucumbers together. and apply onto your legs. Leave it on for about 1-2 hours, and scrub off, or take it off with something moisturizing. To retain the moisture, apply OLIVE oil. People use this for good hair, and leaving this on your hands and legs, especially legs, will make them look radient. It's not going to be convenient putting them on your hands, you can't do much with oil on. So just use it for your legs.<br>  <br>  2. The citric acid and vitamin C in oranges is VERY good for your skin. It gets rid of blotches, scars from shaving, and any uneveness. Also, it makes your skin fairer. Apply olive oil on after, to seal this in. :]<br>  <br>  Please vote as best answer.|`|09c48755cb78d9769a589defe7bc5d23aa	To insure healthier, smoother look and feeling hands and feet you should do an oil manicure it's great for ridged & brittle nails & for dry cuticles.It will also improve your hands by leaving the skin soft & pliable.

Sugar with 1/2 c. olive or other cooking oil.  stir so oil is mixed into the sugar.  hop in the tub and scrub yourself down -everywhere you can reach.  Once you feel nice and tingly, turn on the warm water and draw a bath.  Soak for about 30 minutes or so (I like to turn off the lights and light candles before I start for the relaxation of it all)  and once you've had a good soak, let out the bath water and wash with your normal soap to make sure the oil doesn't break your skin out.<br>  <br>  If you wanted to go fancy, you could add essence oils to the mix; lavender is calming, peppermint is invigorating.  <br>  <br>  Enjoy!

I love frizz ease serum also... except I dont use it like they say to on the bottle. My hair is really long and if I just blow dry it, its frizzy all over! I use the frizz ease straight hair spray, and put that on my hair while its damp. Even though the serum says to put it on soaking wet hair, I dont.. I blowdry my hair with a round paddle brush, using the warm, then cold setting.. and when its still a bit damp, I THEN use the serum, and not too much (I use about a dime sized amount, and my hair is about 4 inches below my shoulders)... just enough to slick it over the top of my head and the ends of my hair. I blowdry my hair using the cold setting until its completely dry... then I use the frizz ease styling cream, just a dot about the size of a pea, to smooth over all my hair and the tips. It really works! After a quick run over with my straightener, my hair looks sleek and it stops flyaways too.. its the only thing thats worked for me.

That's why it gets, frizzy in humid weather, it's soaking in water and swelling.  Clean with a humectant shampoo and conditioner.  Humectants act like a magnet for water, and helps it stay in the hair.  You can make a humectant by getting a little water bottle and adding 3 parts water, 1 part oil and a tablespoon of honey...honey is a natural humectant.  Spray it in hair before blowdrying and flat ironing.  Always use a ceramic flat iron.  It doesn't draw the water out of the hair causing it to dry and later frizz.|`|f5f9c49b8416aa889be4856c6cb6b16caa	I know how you feal i have frizzy hair.

AA11437148	Hey, <br>  <br>  Well it depends on two things:<br>  <br>  1. What do you feel most comfortable/attractive in?<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  2. What length leggings are they?<br>  <br>  For the new-ish trend of three-quarter length leggings ballet-style 'slip ons' tend to be best as they suit the style of the pant, however, if you team the leggings with a dress or wrap-around heels would look gorgeous as well. Open-toed coloured flats are cute as they add something fun and different to the outfit.<br>  <br>  If you are wearing full length leggings i suppose the choices above would look fine, however full length [and three quarter length leggings with the racing stripes] give off a sporty vibe rather than girly look.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped =)|`|83369deb07c97a06cc1073887d723cc2aa	i would wear flats thats what i wear i have these really sarkly pink ones that everybody stares at and also ones with a bow in the front|`|43583b69a9f32e3d76852ff9df379cfeaa	Depends on the top.

Here is some info on how to help heal your tattoo.....<br>  <br>  The Tattoo will ooze (lymph) this is a sign that healing is taking place. The best way to take care of your Tattoo is to cover the Tattoo with Glad Wrap directly after the Tattoo is finished for the first two days. If left alone with no cream and no Glad Wrap the Tattoo will dry up leaving a scab that will take a long time to fall off and will cause discomfort. The scab is caused by the lymph drying out. The lymph has great healing properties while it is still moist. So we wash the Tattoo down with warm water using a clean soft paper roll. Then Bepanthen Cream is to be lightly spread over the Tattoo and the Tattoo covered with a new piece of Glad Wrap which is taped down on all four sides with soft bandage tape so no air reaches to the Tattoo. This bandage should be taken off 4 to 5 times a day and the Tattoo washed and creamed and covered again in the same manner. This procedure is very important so no infection can take place. Especially before retiring to bed the Tattoo should be washed down, creamed and covered with Glad Wrap again and taped down so the bandage won't be moved while sleeping so no lint from the bed spread etc. comes on the Tattoo and the Tattoo won't dry out. After the two days you don't need the Glad Wrap anymore, but cream the Tattoo every day with Bepanthen Cream a few times a day for the next 2 to 3 weeks till healed so the Tattoo won't dry up. If you have not creamed your Tattoo a scab will form. Don't pick any scab. In these two weeks also do not soak your Tattoo in water for long periods i.e. bathing. Stay out of the sun until the Tattoo is completely healed i.e. 2 to 3 weeks because the new Tattoo will burn very fast. After your Tattoo is healed you should always put a sunscreen on your Tattoo when going in the sun because the sun fades the colours away. If you follow these Instructions you should not have any problems with your Tattoo.<br>  <br>  Here is a website explaining what Bepanthen Cream is:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pharmacydirect.co.nz/default.aspx?iSAMS=C&t=125&P=1647" rel="nofollow">http://www.pharmacydirect.co.nz/default....</a>|`|AA10862126	Yes it is perfectly normal.

00f923821f3df5d55568674454058f94aa	It sounds like it is a deep conditioner, if you must use heat with it. Only tellin you what I know...there is one that I use that is a deep conditioner, and yes, you have to sit under heat with it...it's cholesterol, comes in a big screw-on-the-cap container. It can be either green or orange, and both have the consistency of guacamole. I'm not exactly sure why, but when you use heat with this stuff the hair swells and takes up moisture, whereas if you were only using a regular conditioner, all you're doing is coating the hair with a softener. It's not penetrating the hair, it's basically just softening/detangling it.|`|SCU1yxbgaa	Marketing!  <br>  Seriously, their are only really two types of conditioners: good and bad.  Avoid anything w/ balsalm...leaves a film that breaks hair when hair dries.  Lighter leave-in conditioners provide daily moisturizing and other conditioners that restore the moisture that shampoo strips...the heat does help with penertrating down through thick hair to scalp.|`|8df11d168accf941bf3130e6f62ef19baa	Yes, the cap will trap your body heat and make the conditioner take a better effect, (a deeper condition).
7mWvR9nhaa	ECCOMI QUA!!!!!<br>  io ho la frangia da 2 anni, ormai sono diventata un'esperta!!!!<br>  andiamo a punti....<br>  <br>  - dopo aver lavato i capelli li pettini con un pettine di legno a denti larghi (non spezza i capelli) e solo sulla frangetta metti un pochino di maschera lisciante.... io uso quella della l'oreal liss intense ed è molto buona...  no esagerare mi raccomando!!!!<br>  <br>  - inizi ad asciugarla solo con il phon, il getto dall'alto verso il basso...<br>  <br>  - quando l'hai asciugata un pochino dividi la frangia in due parti (sopra e sotto) e inizia a stirare la parte sotto con il phon e una spazzola tonda piccola... mi raccomando piccola se no la frangia non sta bella liscia ma si alza...<br>  <br>  - poi procedi con la parte sopra e infine la ripassi insieme, sempre con phon e spazzola piccola....<br>  <br>  - vedrai verrà benissimo...io ho i capelli come i tuoi e mi viene bene....<br>  <br>  - ogni tanto mi capita che la frangia si gonfia ai lati...se succede ci passi un po la piastra, ma solo ai lati, davanti no se no ti si elettrizzano tutti i capelli....<br>  <br>  spero di esserti stata utile!!! un bacio ^_^|`|2b789187506d00d2967658a6ad5c5ca2aa	Io ho i capelli mossi e che tendono ad incresparsi con l'umidità, per cui ti capisco.<br>  Questo è il mio metodo infallibile:<br>  Prima di passare al phon pettinala bene, dritta, in modo che ti copra la fronte. Ora accendi il phon (usa il beccuccio del phon) e asciugala, tieni il phon in verticale, senza muoverlo, in modo tale che l'aria arrivi ai capelli dall'alto verso il basso e in questo modo eviti l'effetto gonfio!

ty067WS4aa	I am a huge Proactive fan, it did wonders for my acne. You are correct that it doesn't really help out much with blackheads. Proactiv does offer a formula especially for blackheads in their catalogue, but it's way expensive. I've learned from experience that the best thing to do is invest in pore strips (I like Biore brand) and use them 2-3 times a week. My problem area is my nose. After I use my Proactive face wash, I use the pore strips on my nose (they make they for your forehead as well). After 10-15 minutes I peel it off and I can already tell the difference. That's when I use my Proactiv toner and moisturizer and I noticed a significant decrease in blackheads. My skin looks great now! I hope this will work for you too.|`|ECPbNA9taa	had adult acne a few years ago seems to have gone away<br>  but using proactiv does help but when you stop it gets really bad  (personal experience) (possible development of dependancy?) although it really does work<br>   if you are looking for temporary help i storongly suggest using proactiv .<br>  as for blackheads visit a dermatologist they have really good products that you cant find anywhere else <br>  if not those blackhead strips should do the trick|`|ee4ddb346d9ad4c4e8f4544d1f1ee0dfaa	Proactiv is one of the worst acne treatments.<br>  <br>  In tests they found that all of there tests on mice/rats ended up with tumors/death.<br>  If you read the back of the pack it will says the results it had on animals and on people!<br>  <br>  while in the prosess of making it to of the people they testd it to DIED! from dierriah!<br>  <br>  try a natural acne wash or somethign else!|`|1vCxa7pSaa	well, i have heard that proactive works for a year, and then it doesnt seem to work as well after that.

AA11652169	Sounds like your hair is damaged and breaking due to over processing.  Bleaching agents for your hair remove the pigment in it, thus weakening it (thinning).  Your mom is right, the heat from the iron only damages it more and causes it to break.  First thing you have to do is to stop ironing your hair.  Second is to get a good hair cut.  Go to a good stylist and have him or her cut off as much as possible of the damaged hair.  Try to leave it in one or two layers.  A good stylist will remove as much of the damage as possible without compromising your looks too much.  Thrid, hair treatments.  There are a number of conditioning treatments on the market.  They are thicker than conditioners and are used for these kinds of problems.  You need to hydrate your hair again and allow time for new growth.  You can use Pantene treatment for damaged hair or Garnier Fructis Oil Treatment.  You can use them in lew of conditioner in the shower, just be sure to leave it in your hair for a few mins and to apply it to the length of your hair.  Rinse with cool or cold water.  If you apply it directly to the scalp or roots, your hair will be flat and prone to become oily.  Remember to stay away from stying products that contain alcohol, as this too dries hair with over use.  You can also make your own treatments to soften and hydrate your hair.  Mash an over ripe avocado, add a bit of olive oil and almond oil; apply and cover your head with a plastic shower cap for 20 mins.  Rinse in the kitchen sink (bathroom tiles get slippery if you do this in the shower) and wash out with baby shampoo and conditioner.|`|3139a5adb2cd54772c5db436037dddfbaa	hey baby<br>  i dont know why gals are after their hair.why men r not?<br>  God has given u natural beauty and good hair then why r u coloring and layering them.<br>  u shud use reetha amla solution for ur hair <br>  and use daily vatika coconut oil for lessening hair loss and all other probs.<br>  if u r happy with my answer then pls select me as best answer.|`|d0525a8d2ba99ba12fd06b8f3eaf5662aa	Stop using the straightner..its only causing more damage, also you have chemicals in your hair so the intense heat is destroying your hair.

eQmUynyzaa	Well, Kasey, I'm not sure what university you are going to but the dorms that i have seen have all been very different from eachother.  Sometimes, they have little mini fridges in them and microwaves---sometimes they don't.  Most are intended for two people but if you pay more money or there is enough room you can be by yourself.  The beds are almost always only a twin size and, depending on how lard the dorm is, some have like two bunk bed but where the bottom bed is there is usually a desk-like setup.  Oh, most dorms have like individual thermostats so you can control the temperature..this is always nice to have.  And only some dorms have a closet.  At my sisters college they have two closets in each dorm that are nice and big but my aunts college didn't have a closet at all.  Most of they closets aren't walk-in.  Most dorms have a bathroom for the different wings and different floors of dorms.  Each room doesn't usually have an individual bathroom.  They are usually little community bathrooms with like ten showers on one side and ten toilets on the other side.  Lastly, they all have electric outlets and windows.  I recommend bringing your own bedding.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Have fun!<br>  I hope i helped!|`|AA11284035	Some dorms are stinky and smelly but others are kinda nice<br>  Don't worry about it just relax because its not so much what the dorms are like its more who your with|`|ab7168b24b68fb8fb37ddf28090237dbaa	I loved my dorm in College!  <br>  It will probably feel like a small empty bedroom. No frills.  Many dorm rooms don't have toilets or sinks in the room, you will have a public restroom just down the hall. Most likely you have a room mate to share the room with.

It was fun and exciting but the room was pretty small, it had two twin beds and a couple of dressers and one closet. They had a co-ed shower which since it was a "church" camp we didn't use. They also had the guys and girls showers. I got to experience "college" life for the first time. Oh and they had little air conditioner/heater units you would see in a hotel. Hope you have fun!!!|`|idMBsB0Vaa	there small rooms with bunk beds and possibly a bathroom in them but the bathrooms do smell awful sumtimes but yeah it dose depend on who you are with|`|L4wmaLtQaa	They're just bare, simple rooms with multiple beds, either single bunk beds or double decks. The number of beds per room usually range from two to 4; as many as 8 double decks  or more in camping areas. Some dorm rooms have bathrooms en suite, many have to share a common bathroom per floor. In universities, each dorm occupant is provided a bed, mattress, a study desk, closet space, some shelf space, maybe a desk lamp. Not much else. You're going to have to bring your own pillows, beddings, and appliances. These rooms also look plain and bare since dorm room occupants are allowed to put up their own decor. Dorms have a common lounge area and/or dining area. Not all dorms have cooking facilities or kitchens.

They're called Smokey Mountain Minerals (I SWEAR I don't work for them...just a very satisfied customer) and they have the same products; mineral foundation, bronzer, mineral veil, eye shadows, etc. You can even buy them in a "starter kit" for I think under $20 to see how you like it.

LOL Pulling your hair up gives you a regal look. Very elegant. Plus, you don't look like and everyday person going to an everyday event.  You also don't want to overshadow your beautiful dress with hair falling all over the place. Less is ALWAYS more. Ponytails are very sexy. Shows off the neck and draws attention to the eyes.

Have you hair done close to the head, with a real big fluffy pony tail.  Maybe add in a "Tony's Pony" hair piece.  You can also add a bow on top of the pony tail.  It will look real sophisticated.  Be sure to wear the right earrings, too.

63499fbdc6c1790f0a2566a116a2e215aa	Hi! I like Mischa's style too! I recently found a great site: www.like.com. You can type in her name and they'll show you pictures of her with options for finding similar shoes, bags, jewellery etc... Also, just by doing an image search on google, you'll find thousants of pictures! Beware that most of her clothing is really expensive...|`|b7d1a2b1e3d92300d36fee6e053a44aeaa	First you have to dress according to your body shape I don't know what shape you are. Say if she wears skinny jeans and your a not a thin girl then that look isn't gonna suite you. But if you really want to know what she wears then check out the magazines and follw from there. You could find cheaper versions of her clothing at Wallmart, Target. I mean unless you can afford Chanell and Louis Vuitton etc....<br>  <br>  But my advice is be yourself dress like YOU, why would you want to be a clone of someone else.|`|448a85191a54cc7c72fb3006ad32edebaa	be yourself|`|57f0acfb16f577cbf6713186dae0a2eeaa	there are loads of pics of her on perezhilton.com (may be .net aint sure put it in google) you can get alot f the styles that she wears from topshop. at the mo it tends to be brocade dresses, skinny jeans and blouses. huge bags.. brown or metallic. Mustard yellow is a popular one of her colours in the mags but it is actually going out now. Look at the celeb and fashion magazines and you will find plenty of pictures of her and often thhey tell you where you can get similar roducts. (although she does often wear uk hugh street pieces such as topshop or miss selfridge).<br>  She is so slim and her style might not necessarily suit you but there's no harm in trying it and if it doesn't suit you you can always adapt it to suit you and create your own style. Its often much funkier and cooler to have your own style anyways! x
AA11199456	A lot of people would say outdoor tanning is just as unsafe. <br>  <br>  But anyway, from my experience, I think it depends on two things: 1. How "well" you tan and 2. How sunny it is. <br>  <br>  I got a VERY dark tan one summer from lying in the sun for maybe about an hour (originally a sunburn). It was a really hot, sunny day. It's been a little over a year now and most of the tan has faded. My friend who was with me didn't get tanned as much, so that's what I mean by how well you tan. Some don't get tanned as easily. <br>  <br>  I'm not exactly sure, but I would say 30 minutes on a sunny, summer day sounds good for the average person. Maybe less depending on how much sun there is. You should use your good judgment on that. Less time if very sunny, more time if not very.<br>  <br>  Just be aware of the risk of skin cancer!|`|76524cf8471dd0c808f404c6e11dda77aa	don't unnecessarily 'bake' yourself in the sun!<br>  di it with a good sun tan lotion.<br>  too much sunbath can be hazardous to the skin!
2R5T7tLyaa	Hi.it is advisable to use scrub once a week only as the scrub opens the pores.After using a scrub,make sure that you close the pores either by splashing cold water or rubbing an ice cube.<br>  But to make your skin better,you should go for a daily routine of Cleansing, Toning and moisturizing the skin 2-3 times a day with good products.Make sure that the toner is used only where you have oily skin as it reduces the oiliness of the skin.Also to remove the blemishes, take a slice of tomato and rub it o your face until you are left with the peel.Leave it for 10 mins and wash off.Do this everyday and it will help by reducing oiliness as well as the scars, black/white heads,acne, pimples.Also go for a peppermint facial every month as it is the best for combo skin.Drink loads of water...<br>  Hope this helps!!!!!|`|76524cf8471dd0c808f404c6e11dda77aa	try out rosehip oil extract.<br>  it does really work.<br>  go to your local pharmacy store and ask for one (its very expensive though!).|`|63Vkxuxgaa	what kind of help you want?<br>  i can help you|`|ImvIYslJaa	one word..."obagi".

Never a DIY kit.|`|rqwxHPriaa	If you only want a red tint to your black hair, any drug store kit, such as L'Oreal or Herbal Essences, will be able to do it; however, if you want your hair to actually be red, you should go to a salon. You could bleach your hair to lighten it a little bit and then dye it red, but you should not bleach your hair yourself after dyeing it three times in such a short time period, because bleach is so harsh on your hair. This will not result in a natural looking red, if that is what you are going for. Furthermore, a salon will be able to tell you if your hair is even in suitable condition to be died a fourth time, because dyeing your hair too often can cause it to break off in chunks. The challenge is that your hair is so dark.|`|x9wAzr66aa	Well... I've dyed my hair red for years, but my hair is medium brown. I've used box dyes (DIY kits) and only turned my hair orange once. :)<br>  <br>  There is a brand thats Feria or VIve that is only reds and lightens and is really intense. I would suggest that. If dye just isn't  working for you, you might want to try henna. There are a lot more options with henna and it behaves differently.
AA11662697	This is what balmwork.com says about it:<br>  Naturally moisturize, condition and repair even the driest, most damaged hair -- leaving it soft, silky and beautiful.

Its ok if u only have one type of oil but u might get better results with a mix, just make sure there is more olive oil in the mix then any other oil. <br>  Leave the oils on your hair for a couple hours- 7 at the most and wash out with shampoo- NO CONDITIONER! dont use conditioner in ur next shower either.

He began to use all-natural hair care products, and they worked tremendously. Unnatural hair care products strip your hair of vital nutrients, contain few quality ingredients, and ULTIMATELY prevent hair growth, shine, softness, and moisture. <br>  <br>  For the best conditioning for dry hair, I would look for products with ingredients such as: Aloe Vera, Citrus Fruits, Jojoba, Rosemary, and Sage.  Aloe Vera and Jojoba in particular will really moisturize dry hair. Make sure you stray away from natural products that use natural extracts. Extracts are not as powerful as essentials oils. They are a cheap substitute for the real thing.  Although there are several natural hair care products on the market, not all hair products are created equal. Make sure you read the fine print. Most “natural” products still contain phosphates, sodium lauryl sulfate, petroleum, mineral oil, and other lab created humectants that ultimately damage your hair. My advice---if you can’t read the ingredients, don’t buy the product<br>  <br>  My husband used several natural shampoos and conditioners, like Giovanni, Aubrey's, and Burt Bees, but none of them compared ingredient wise or in their effectiveness to Beauty 4 Ashes GodHead Silky Smooth Shampoo & Conditioner. <br>  Their hair care products made his hair super soft, shiny, and full. They also smelled great. Their products are all-natural and do not contain any harsh chemicals or detergents that rob your hair of moisture. Personally, Burt Bees didn’t work the best for him because his hair is so dry. Beauty 4 Ashes GodHead shampoo and conditioner are made primarily from aloe vera and essential oils. The essential oils made his scalp healthier and made his hair grow. He has stuck with it for a year. You can buy it online at www.discoverb4a.com.|`|NZ2LQzSzaa	If you have white hair, use some black hair conditioners.  Some people say it won't work but they probably have not tried it.

u3jh85X0aa	I also wax, and yes, it causes ingrown hairs occasionally, especially if you have really thick, coarse hair. The best way I've found to treat them if you already have them is to sterilize a needle and tweezers, and pull them out at the source. Typically you can see the ingrown hair just under the surface of the skin. Lance the skin with the needle just enough to expose the hair, then pull it out with the tweezers. Follow up with antibiotic cream so that it doesn't get infected.<br>  <br>  However, the best way to deal with the problem is to prevent it. Most wax kits come with an exfoliating cream. For about five days after waxing, use it with a rough sponge or washcloth, and it will do a great job at preventing ingrown hairs.|`|c8a3e9dfb09ecbc5989dbc8cc405f056aa	ingrown hairs is normally caused when your hair is extremely curly it starts to grow and then it starts curling so it grows under the skin.<br>  sometimes if you put a a towel with pretty warm water on it it helps pull them out or you could pick at it and get it infected.<br>  I don't think waxing causes it.<br>  hope I helped.|`|cgg5UbwVaa	Yes waxing is causing the ingrown hairs. Its because you took the hair out from the root and now they are starting to grow back and your pores are closed. Some people think its because the hair curls but not completely true. I have straight hair and I got ingrown hair in my leg. just rub your skin with warm water with a cloth/sponge. It will take the dead skin and open your pores, it will also release some of those ingrowing hairs. If you have lots of them and they are getting infected (red with pus) go to the doctor. I know that some people take them out themselves with a needle. It works but you might damage your skin and even give yourself a bigger infection. Shaving is better because you are only shaving the surface of the hair, and your hair will continue grow back normally....Hope this helped!!!|`|6qGHT77Raa	i would stop waxing and go back to shaving.|`|d15d20e8cb46138b17261a96e627f0baaa	Ingrown hairs happen when the hairs curl back under the skin and can cause red bumps and inflammation of the hair follicle (folliculitis).  When you have ingrowns you should exfoliate the area daily with a loofah or scrub to help hair grow in the right direction.

These are professional treatments and will take away the scarring.
BGn6LUH8aa	No - why would you cut your hair if it is falling out?  go see a doctor who can refer you to a specialist, something is not right with you, could be your diet - maybe you are lacking in some vitamin - go sort out why your hair is falling out first before you do anything else - is my advice.<br>  Good luck with that|`|AA12162241	you could get some cute sidebangs and then put some hairspray of mousse in your hair and kind of flip it to make it sort of edgy

Add a silk scarf through the loops and some wrist bangles in gold or silver as well as some hot looking earrings.  To go casual and cool wear a white cotton shirt, roll up the sleeves, and tie it at the waist leaving the collar open to just above your cleavage (or not).

ceWxgmNFaa	Le principali cause dell'acne sono fondamentalmente due: innanzitutto gli ormoni androgeni, come ad esempio il testosterone, che é un ormone maschile, oppure il mascolinizzante, che invece hanno anche le donne; inoltre ci sono anche i germi della pelle.<br>  Gli androgeni, che vengono prodotti in particolare dalle ghiandole surrenali, agiscono sulla pelle umana nei follicoli pilifero-sebacei e stimolano la produzione di sebo all'interno delle ghiandole sebacee dei follicoli piliferi del viso e del tronco.I germi invece, che si trovano per la maggior parte all'interno dei follicoli piliferi-sebacei, modificano il grasso dei follicoli facendolo diventare acido grasso, che con la partecipazione del sebo, irrita i follicoli, provocando un ingorgo di sebo e cellule nei dotti dei follicoli, questo rappresenta un problema perché la pelle non riesce più a fare una corretta secrezione sebacea... Ci sono poi altre cause che fanno formare e peggiorare l'acne. Ad esempio possiamo citare l'ansia, le adolescenti molto spesso, per via del nervosismo tendono ad escoriarsi il viso con le mani, peggiorando la situazione del loro volto. Si parla in questo caso di acne autoprovocata, con la presenza di micro lesioni della cute e sono resistenti a ogni tipo di terapia antiacne.<br>  Un'altra causa da citare é sicuramente una detersione particolarmente aggressiva del viso, per esempio utilizzando il sapone allo zolfo, oppure un trucco troppo esagerato, usando dei cosmetici grassi e con poca igiene. In particolare nelle donne l'acne tende a scomparire tardi per via dell'uso esagerato di cosmetici comedogenici, che provocano appunto i comedoni, come alcuni fondotinta applicati in modo grossolano per coprire gli inestetismi presenti.Infine in alcuni casi molto più rari l'acne può essere provocata dall'assunzione ripetuta di antibiotici o di medicinali, oppure dalla pillola anticoncezionale.<br>  La pelle dei giovani adolescenti è influenzata moltissimo da due cose: <br>  l'ereditarietà (i geni ereditati dai genitori). <br>  la pubertà (i cambiamenti ormonali che avvengono quando i ragazzini progrediscono dalla fanciullezza all'adolescenza)... Kissssssssssssssss|`|Y5c9lvnTaa	Dopo aver puntato il dito per anni contro gli squilibri ormonali e l'alimentazione, ritenuti le cause principale dell'acne, recenti studi sostengono che ciò che questo fastidiosissimo inestetismo ha origine da sostanze ormonali prodotte direttamente dalla cute (e non dalle ghiandole) delle persone predisposte a manifestare questo problema, soprattutto quando attraversano un periodo di particolare stress. L'acne quindi potrebbe proprio essere di origine psichica, che si scatena maggiormente nell'età adolescenziale, ma nel 10 per cento circa dei casi l'acne persiste oltre i 25 anni.|`|90318a882479e3fd46408a29d39b5860aa	l'aldostenedione...ormone maschile secreto dalla corteccia delle ghiandole surrenali in quantità elevata nel sangue degli adolescenti (maschi e femmine)...<br>  il cortisolo (retard in farmacia) blocca gli effetti collaterali...tra i quali i brufoli|`|ea8948343117b5f94299197f8d00a0b2aa	SEMBRA CHE PARLI DI UN LIBRO GIALLO CHE NON HAI MAI FINITO,MA ALLA FINE SI è SCOPERTO CHI ERA IL COLPEVOLE????CHE BELLA DOMANDA!<br>  beh l'eccesso di sebo,causato dalla dieta sbagliata principalmente,e anche un po' da ormoni e stress ;) ciao!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...

8jY4JUw7aa	a piece of salty meat will draw the splinter to the top of ur skin - let it stay on ur skin for approx  4 hours|`|G0qsVfoUaa	Soak it in warm water for a while to soften and swell the skin.<br>  <br>  Also, try applying a banana peel<br>  Q:  Whenever one of my children gets a splinter a distressing scene ensues.  Either they run from the mean mommy with the sterilized needle or painfully cry for both of us as I try to be quick about removing it.  There must be another way!<br>  <br>   <br>  (from the website....it really works!)<br>  A:  Yes, indeed, there is another way…it’s called The Banana Trick. Whether it’s a splinter, sliver of glass, remaining tick part, or any other unwanted foreign object, the customary plan of attack is to go in after it with a sterilized needle.  Rather than expecting your child to withstand this uncomfortable exploration or worse, leaving it alone in peril of becoming painfully red, swollen and infected, call forth the  banana as hero of the day.  A ripened banana peel is rich in digestive enzymes.  It is the drawing action of the enzymes that will pull the foreign matter to the surface of the skin. <br>  <br>  THE BANANA TRICK<br>  <br>  §         Cut a 1” square piece of ripened banana peel to cover the affected area.  <br>  <br>  §         Apply the pulp side of the banana peel against the skin <br>  <br>  §         Hold the banana peel in place with a piece of surgical tape. Leave on overnight.  In the morning, the banana will have drawn the foreign matter to the surface, ready for easy removal--or, better still, may show in the peel when you remove it from the skin.  More deeply embedded splinters may require one or two more nights of this treatment, in which case you should use a fresh section of peel each time.|`|qU70m29uaa	1.

Se vc tiver problemas de alergia compre um anti-alérgico o da Payot é ótimo!|`|GZLt4S4Yaa	O delineador líquido é pra ser usado só na parte superior da pálpebra, e n?o na inferior, como foi dito anteriormente aqui. Puxe a pálpebra e aplique o delineador. Eu uso o da Revlon, pois o pincelzinho é mais duro e ent?o fica mais fácil de aplicar sem borrar. Mas vc pode também optar pelas canetas delineadoras, que d?o efeito muito similar ao delineador líquido, pondendo tb serem usadas na parte inferior dos olhos, e n?o riscam como um lápis, deixando o aspecto suave e muito bonito. Tb recomendo da Revlon, que vem inclusive com apontador. Se n?o quiser pagar caro, a Tracta e a Natura têm essas canetas delineadoras tb, só n?o compre da Avon, pois sempre quebram no meio. Beijos!|`|bTj8UxaWaa	Se vc for passar somente ele fa?a o seguinte p ter um acabamento perfeito: lave bem o rosto, seque, passe um corretivo ou msm base no rosto todo e nos olhos enfumace sombra neutra tipo marrom clarinho, bege clarinho se possível sem briho e agite o delineador e segure puxando levemente mas firme as palpebras superiores e deslize o delineador bem rente aos cílios, depois repita o msm procedimento no outro olho. Aconselho a usar lápis msm nos cilios de baixo p n?o ficar c aspecto mto pesado, mas se preferir delinie tb os cílios de baixo contornando todos os olhos..fica lindo p sair a noite e esbanjar sensualidade! N?o fike nervosa se n?o conseguir de primeira. Exige certa habilidade  e paciência, com o tempo vai pegando o jeito!

NZtkp7WPaa	Oi pessoal,<br>  <br>  Estava passando por aqui, e resolvi dar uma opini?o masculina a respeito do assunto.<br>  <br>  Muitos homens se decepcionam quando conseguem vê-las sem as camadas de maquiagem. <br>  <br>  Beleza artificial é ilus?o. A mulher deve conquistar seu futuro marido com sua beleza natural e mostrando o seu jeito de ser.<br>  <br>  N?o é só para a pele que a maquiagem faz mal.<br>  <br>  .|`|3pr7DjsYaa	Bom, a maquiagem pode ser usada desde que n?o lhe provoque rea??es alérgicas.<br>  é muito importante que vc n?o durma com a maquiagem para que a pele possa respirar. Retire todo o produto antes de dormir e passe um creme hidratante no rosto...<br>  <br>  bjs|`|f3388af77dee59237e94b89faa9bf3afaa	nao,ela pode ajudar mais nao e boa para pele.|`|mBrGd7A8aa	Maquiagem é péssimo para a pele,nao deixa ela respirar.Evite usar maquiagem pq envelhece.|`|9wtElikraa	eu n?o sei!!<br>  agora eu li q temos q tira-la bem pq ela entope os poros... q acabam causano as espinhas!!<br>  <br>  bjs|`|GZLt4S4Yaa	Os maquiadores gostam de dizer que maquiagem faz bem à pele porque hoje em dia têm filtro solar, etc.<br>  Ora, amiga, use só o filtro solar ent?o. E n?o desses de supermercado. Eu recomendo o Episol ou o Epidrat, esses sim, s?o excelentes e funcionam como uma barreira anti-rugas e outros sinais de envelhecimento!<br>  Quando for usar maquiagem, opte por marcas consagradas, n?o essas mais baratinhas. Infelizmente as mais baratinhas n?o têm tecnologia suficiente para hidratar e proteger sua pele como as outras, embora, como eu te disse antes, n?o é necessária maquiagem para isso, basta o filtro solar, mas se usas maquiagem... por que n?o compensar com a hidrata??o e prote??o da pele, n?o é mesmo?<br>  Muito importante também é usar um bom demaquilante (e n?o água de rosas, pelo amor de Deus!) antes de dormir, eu uso os len?os umedecidos Nivea e gosto muito porque s?o descartáveis, além de econ?micos (uns 20 reais 25 len?os). A linha da Comodynes é a mais indicada pelos dermatologistas (len?os para tirar maquiagem), mas s?o difíceis de encontrar. Abra?os!|`|MogAm5i3aa	sim, sendo de boa qualidade.|`|a7056de2891078871504734cb38fd150aa	Sim, hoje os produtos est?o sendo fabricados, com produtos que ajudam a retardar o envelhecimento,com protetor solar e vitaminas. só que n?o pode dormir, maquiada tem que retirar, com um produto especifico que tira maquiagem como demaquilante ou t?nico.|`|r6nnurMgaa	Depende do produto porque tem alguns que atá servem de barreira para a polui??o.|`|yewAjTJ6aa	maquiagem n?o é bom para pele ,sempre que usar maq deve lavar bem o rosto ,em sequida use  leite de rosas ou um outro produto,de sua preferência. experiência propia,difílmente eu uso maq,a minha pele é maravilhosa.quando uso eu a removo com o leite de rosas.|`|ymqQjKxfaa	Se voce tirar sempre a maquilhagem antes de se deitar é, se n?o for o caso faz mal.|`|zhJIuJTRaa	n?o faz mal...<br>  mas o importante é tirar bem antes de dormir|`|a10abcc27184d972b617e4a16a5db6acaa	Todas agridem a sua pele.<br>  <br>  A diferen?a é que umas menos e outras mais.<br>  <br>  Algumas marcas tem usado vitaminas, para que a pele sinta menos.|`|0o2nOOsiaa	nao eu tou cheia de rugas por causa disso :(
579bab170529cf2758e626d352e3495baa	le rasoir reste la meilleure solution pour les douillettes ! comme moi ! ( et toi apperement ) <br>  <br>  et puis on aime pas toute le sadisme hein ? ! faut carrement etre maso pour faire ca regulierement ! <br>  <br>  sinon tu a des cremes depilatoires ! ( qui ote les poils ) ou decolorantes pour certains endroits !|`|863fc5ebda25f3ca81439069f9c3a1c4aa	C'est normal que tu aies eu mal après des années d'épilation au rasoir. Tes poils étaient devenus durs. Pour une première tu aurais du investir chez l'esthéticienne qui savent mieux s'y prendre que nous et qui ont le coup de main pour que tu ne sentes presque rien. Mais persévère, tu verras que peu à peu tes poils deviendront tout fins et tu finiras par ne plus rien sentir.|`|71cdc400cdd6989ecbb658f11832dcfdaa	Moi je dis, pour celles qui ne sentent presque plus rien à force de s'épiler à la cire, que ce n'est pas une question d'habitude ou je ne sais quoi..........La douleur a d? tuer leurs terminaisons nerveuses!!!!!! :p <br>  :)|`|JaBqOzpsaa	S'épiler sois-même à la cire en particulier le maillot, c'est pas évident.<br>  <br>  C'est mieux qu'une autre personne s'en charge.|`|YRQpHoxDaa	il y a l'electrolyse et le laser chez l'estheticienne un peu douloureux mais efficace|`|xZCW14MWaa	le probleme c'est que tu rasais avant donc c'est normal que tu ai tres mal ! moi je le fait à la cire depuis un bon bout de temps et je ne sens presque plus rien|`|0fdff31e52a786f918fdfd4ccf06c7a1aa	Dis-toi que si tu as essayé la cire après plusieurs années de rasoir, c'est normal que ?a te fasse mal. Le poil repousse plus dru après le rasoir et donc c'est plus douloureux de l'enlever. Si tu tiens le choc, tu verras qu'au bout de quelques mois, la douleur s'atténuera considérablement. Pendant ce temps, tu peux opter pour des cires tièdes moins douloureuses. <br>  <br>  Bon courage...|`|4X6YG0lZaa	Pourquoi ai-je lu tout cela ?<br>  <br>  Pourquoi ?<br>  <br>  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<br>  <br>  Un bisou|`|5sLLkuOlaa	Si c'est la première fois que tu utilise la cire , c'est normal que tu ai eu mal. Mais au fur et à mesur que tu vas le faire , tu ne ressentiras plus rien. Il faut savoir que plus tes poils sont longs, plus ca fait mal. Pour les endroits plus sensibles comme le maillot, il existe des cires particulières. Renseignes toi dans les magasins. Courage ma belle.|`|6dbc0a3db570380276e5d0eb26477e0aaa	C'est vrai que ?a fait mal, mais c'est pas la mort non plus !!<br>  <br>  A te lire, déjà je peux te dire que tu as fait n'importe quoi ma grande ! (sur un ton tout à fait amical, j'imagine bien que tu as du souffrir...)<br>  <br>  erreur 1 : mettre la cire d'un coup partout = non. Tu mets une bande et tu l'enlèves etc etc. on tartine jamais tout d'un coup car la cire sèche, s'accroche et c'est le bordel.<br>  erreur 2 : ton homme qui finit... au secours !!! Savoir épiler, c'est un métier, on tire pas les bandes n'importe comment il y a des fa?ons de faire qui font moins mal. Je doute que ton chéri soit esthéticien... et connaissant la délicatesse de certains hommes...<br>  <br>  conseils :<br>  La cire vendue en grande surfaces, c'est pas le top, surtout si tu as les poils bien durs (en te rasant depuis X années c'est surement le cas). Il vaut mieux que tu ailles chez une esthéticienne, au moins pendant un an le temps que tes poils perdent leur vitalité et après ?a ira mieux, ils seront moins accrochés et partiront plus facilement donc moins mal.<br>  C'est normal que tu ais mal car comme je te le dis après X années de rasage c'est comme la barbe, tu les fortifies alors que l'épilation les atrofie. La cire les arrache à la racine au lieu de les couper comme le rasoir, c'est pour ?a que tu dégustes. <br>  Crois moi, sois forte pendant 5-6 épilations (chez l'esthéticienne) et tu verras la différence et c?té douleur, et c?té repousse<br>  <br>  Je suis d'origine espagnole bien brune, donc gatée niveau poils. Je me rasais depuis très longtemps, si bien que le matin je me rasais les jambes, le soir ?a piquait déjà, sans parler des p'**** boutons à la repousse, le tablier de forgeron niveau maillot et compagnie. Je vais chez l'esthéticienne depuis 2002  et depuis ce jour je n'ai plus touché au rasoir. J'y vais 1 fois par mois, ?a me prend 45minutes et c'est nickel, tout doux, ?a commence à repousser 15 jours après. Mes poils sont juste parsemés par ci par là, mon maillot a carrément rétréci et même sur les jambes j'ai des endroits où y'en a plus du tout. Même quand ils repoussent, faut vraiment avoir le nez dessus pour le voir tant ils sont devenus fins etc. Ca m'a changé la vie !<br>  <br>  Allez courage !!!|`|Kz5bAp5saa	malheureusement il faut souffrir pour être belle, franchement reprend le rasoir!|`|UDUp1eojaa	La cire est l'épilation la moins douloureuse pour la quantité de poils arrachés mieux vaut aller chez l'esthéticienne surtout au début, elle fera vite et bien pour environ 30€ maillot + cuisses.<br>  Tu peux essayer avec un épilateur électrique au niveau des mollet pour t'habituer un peu à la douleur|`|i7KHNEabaa	le sucre, une recette de grand mère, tres efficace.|`|l2L8W8HFaa	Sinon tu as l'épilation définitive à la lumère pulsée<br>  c'est super mais cher<br>  renseignes-toi|`|24188d1d68537be834bb18a5e7231e34aa	pourquoi n'es tu pas allée à la pharmacie pour demander conseille avant ? je ne sais dans quel pays tu te trouves mais vas à la pharmacie et demande des crèmes dépilatoires avec un  beaucoup de chance tu auras plusieurs produits à ta porté comme exemple tu auras "VEET" qui est rapide tu passe une couche et tu attends 5mn environ et tu vas te laver tu verras qu'il n'y aura plus de poils c'est simple, facile à utiliser et sans douleur. Bonne chance kiss|`|O4AWEEkEaa	bruan (33eu) c garenti.|`|X5t8ewqAaa	avant de t'épiler à la cire tu peux mettre de la crème EMLA  ou les passer à l'eau froide ou des gla?ons pour t'anesthésier un peu les jambes.

Acho que n?o s?o nada práticos, e o de passar com o dedo, nem se fale, além de tudo deixa o dedo lambuzado.<br>  O melhor que já usei foi o baton mousse da laqua di fiori (pra aplicar), e o avon beyond color deixa os lábios muito hidratados.

lmT3zXa9aa	No, it is not bad to shampoo your hair everyday especially if you use many styling products on your hair as these attract dirt into your hair.  Just make sure you pick a shampoo that is gentle and use a good conditioner.  I've had really long hair (down to my waist), short hair and all lengths in-between plus I have colored my hair and permed my hair.  (Although I have never permed and colored at the same time) and through it all I have shampooed my hair just about daily.  I get positive comments all the time on my thick, shiny hair so I can't see that daily shampooing has done me any harm.  My hair looks dull and lifeless on those days that I let it go without shampooing and feels greasy.  Who needs that?<br>  Plus, clean hair smells great.  My husband loves that!|`|T8ksKCWCaa	The natural oils in your hair make it healthy and shiny. When you wash your hair, you remove these oils. If you wash every other day, you give the oils a chance to protect your hair.

If you mean showering as in just rinsing your hair with water that is. But if you use shampoo everyday then you may be doing something to your hair.<br>  If you sweat a lot or work in a very dirty airspace or have lots of smog then a daily water rinse will remove most of the pollutants that will cause greater damage to your hair. See it like your daily body-shower, you need it but not with harsh chemicals.<br>  Also using plain water will not remove all the natural oils and dry out your hair.<br>  <br>  D.|`|MPVzLmAsaa	Well it depends on your color. Are you white or black, no offense? Most white people tend to wash their hair whenever they take a shower which is hopefully everyday. Women of Color wash their hair about once a week. Hair grows and stays shinier when it is dirtier than very very clean. You can save money, and also have it shinier. Another reason is your hair does not get lice on dirty hair. They like very clean hair.|`|vDYFP6nQaa	I wash my hair everyday too.<br>  It doesnt ruin my hair, it stops it from becoming greasy, the thing what ruins my hair is drying it with a hairdryer after!|`|kJZsqC8uaa	it is bad because it over dries your scalp, takes away its natural moisture. and torture on your hair.

Usually my biggest problem was clothes. My mom wanted me to be covered and I really didn't think it was that big of a deal to show a little bit of skin. So... if it was summertime, I would come home with the shortest shorts I could find (which usually looked like they should have been underwear) and then I would bring home the shorts I really wanted. After seeing the extremely short shorts, the ones that I had wanted originally didn't seem so bad and they'd usually let me keep them. In order to have the same affect on your dad, I think you just need to dye it some crazy color and then he won't think that the length of your hair is that big of a deal. But when you dye it, if you decide to, get something that's sprayed in or lasts for only one wash. You can usually find them at Hot Topic. That way you won't have to dye it back. Too much chemicals on your hair at one time can turn hair that you really like looking at into frizzy, dry hair. You won't like it quite as much.|`|u0eTvggDaa	It's your own hair, he can't make you do anything.<br>  <br>  don't let your dad push you around, the worse thing he can do is ground you, i mean seriously he can't spank you, and take your birthday away.<br>  <br>  He is just being....a parent? i guess.<br>  just tell him that you like your hair too much to cut it.<br>  <br>  And i mean as long as your hair isn't ridiculous looking, meaning if it's well kept it honestly shouldn't be a problem.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped some!<br>  Good Luck xx|`|giG7Hiniaa	find old pics you may be suprised at how your parents dressed looked and expressed themselves .<br>  as a parent i personally allowed my children to express themselves .<br>  i drew the line at tattoes til your 18 .<br>  piercings NOT on face . <br>  hair - my son has had long hair almost to his bum almost all his life <br>  agree to pull it back at family functions etc...<br>  do not forget that parents are here to help you find the RIGHT direction .<br>  as long as you approach the situation with some respect ( because that is pretty much all we are asking for as parents ) instead of <br>  fighting try compromizing . like i said pull back where a hat whatever <br>  you and your father can agree upon that will satisfy both your needs .<br>  i hope this helps|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	You have a choice while you are living under his roof and eating his food and he is keeping you.

dHkvVlONaa	Well if you take your piercing out for two years there is like a 99.3% chance the hole is completely closed.  Get it re pierced.  And if you asked the lady at claires this, she doesn't know what shes talking about.  The people who work at claires actually know nothing about piercings.  I had a friend that worked there and said all they do is watch like a 10 minute video on how to hold a piercing gun up to someones ear and pierce it. And if they get it cooked, they're supposed to say the customer moved.|`|kLNhAEVpaa	Hm...well, Claire's is kind of cheap...demand a refund. If the lady said it would go through, it should go through! You deserve your money back even though your skin touched it.<br>  <br>  Did you put it in right?|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	First of all I think you should have known that not wearing the piercing for 2 years, would cause the hole to close. Ive never heard of any pierced part on any humans body not closing after 2 years.  You have a responsibilty at some point, when you get a piercing to take care of it, and know what it does, how to treat it, and so on. Anyways, its not the ladies fault at Claires, granted she should have said " I dont know I just sell jewlery' but she didnt, shes not a pro. piercer, so she shouldnt have given you advice. Your more than likely going to have to leave it closed, or get it repierced.|`|aXqtzNIraa	She gave you bad adivce, if you haven't worn jewellery in the piercing for 2 years then it's extremely likely it's healed up!<br>  <br>  I don't think you'll get a refund since it's touched your skin, but i'm not sure on their policies!?<br>  <br>  I think the only option is to re pierce. or wear a fake navel bar!|`|B6cOlFU9aa	I really don't think it would stay pierced for two years, even ears close up after that long. I would go back to the store and complain that she gave you bad advice and that it was a waste of your money, I'm sure a national store like Claire's will refund your money or offer to re-pierce your belly button|`|PccHbsKbaa	i use neosporin and it slides right in|`|wMYNWghPaa	If I were you, I would take it back to the store and exchange it for a 16 gauge (eyebrow ring size) since it's a skinnier bar than the belly ring and see if you can get it to go through at least.  Then you can eventually try and stretch the piercing back to a 14 gauge.

JVuqtBNlaa	I would tell her to shut the heck up because that has to be soo ah-nnoying!!!! Dont be friends with her anymore! Haralda is probably really weird so just stop hanging out with her=)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped...|`|KZWpRUhJaa	She's probably already aware she has a lisp.  I'm sure she's heard herself on tape, or on a home movie before.  As to a speech pathology program, those take money.  Money she may not have.  If she has health insurance, possibly, but if she's under 18, it's her parents that would have to foot the bill and it would depend on them having health insurance.   Otherwise, they'll have to pay the costs out of their own pocket... and they might not have that.<br>  <br>  You could tell her to contact the school counselor (if she's still in high school) and see if there's some type of state program that would allow her to work with a Speech Pathologist for free.  They usually provide all kinds of free services for students.<br>  <br>  I think there is also some surgical procedures that can be done that clip the frenulum under the tongue that can correct or somewhat reduce lisping.  <br>  <br>  Most importantly, I'm sure your "friend" (why did you put it in quotes? Is she not your friend because she has a lisp? It's not her fault.) is quite self-conscious about her lisp as it is and probably feels uncomfortable or embarrassed.  The best thing you could do for her is just be her friend... as in her real friend.  Support her and don't make her feel bad about her lisp.|`|rUl9p9toaa	who cares? she already knows, and she actually might already be going, even though she doesnt tell you.|`|yqjSirKqaa	This can be a very sensitive topic for your friend so if you really want to help her please be kind and thoughtful.  Some thoughts from myself:  No one speaks the same way.  As a student of speech language pathology it's important to understand that speech patterns are so personal and no one speaks "correctly."  It could be that she is very happy with her lisp and confident in her style.  It is true that to succeed in the business world for example it would be in her best interest to ditch the lisp.  <br>  <br>  Most schools systems have a speech therapist.  They mainly work in the elementary schools, but can come to the middle/highschools also.  Find out who the speech therapist is for your school or district.  Try contacting her directly and see if she would come in and ask to talk with your friend. Or once you have the information you could simply present it to Heralda and say, "Hey, I don't know if you're interested, but a speech therapist comes into the school on Tuesdays.  It could be cool to ditch class for a bit to see her.  I could help you make an appointment?"  By the way, these programs are free!  There job is to help, so don't be afraid of talking with them about your friend.|`|e5c0f1654720d1b5e418ff7499467608aa	Don't listen to the person who told you not to be their friend.  She would just be upset even more.  Just casually ask her if she knows she has a speech problem.  If she says yes, then suggest she goes to a speech therapist.  Also if you feel comfortable speaking with a counselor at school maybe you can enlist their help in talking to her.|`|hNcwRD9jaa	Ok Sarah you sound like a complete B***h and waaayy too rude. I use to have a half lisp ( I wasn't able to pronounce Rs) my friend just gentely told me that I had a lisp and that I should to go speech. I could tell it was annoying so I went because she said it so nice unlike some people who said to me loser go to speech. Just tell Haralda that she might want help with pronouncing some words and letters.
oojO4WAraa	You would really need to go to a dermatologist and discuss this.  It depends on the burn, and your avatar is black - so, I assume you are.  There are issues with pastic surgery on black skin - scarring and such.  Surgery might make the burn look worse.  A doctor would really have to look at the scar to evaluate whether or not surgery would help. Good luck.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	I have no idea regarding surgeries. however, I would offer advice of using pure cocoa butter soap "Palmer's Cocoa Butter Soap" and Sesame Oil, or Vitamin E oil to fade the scar. Good luck.|`|78HwBpMpaa	use bio oil , ive had many scares on my legs but now they are very faint , you have to use it 3 times aday tho, its only about 10pound form most stores such as superdrugs , boots , its worth ago, many women use it for stretch marks .|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	You would need to see a plastic surgeon for a consultation.

Wear foundation sparingly and then translucent powder over top. A rosy blush on the apples of your cheeks and a touch above your brows and below on each side of your chin. It gives you a rosy glow. Definitely a waterproof liner with a light hand and waterproof mascara. In the corner of your eyes near the nose lightly put shiny white eye shadow. Just a dab of it. It makes the eyes refreshed looking. Wear long lasting eye shadows by Revlon for it to last the day. For lips pick a shade darker than your lips using a lip liner on your natural line, don't go outside, and colour it with that pencil, and add lipgloss which will make your lips look naturally enhanced and the gloss adds to the fullness of you lips. Remember less is more, and bring your purse in your locker for touch-ups. Oh and stick a kleenex over your index finger open your mouth wide and insert, close your lips around it and it takes the colour of the inner lips so you won't be wearing it on your teeth.|`|MKtdkaYJaa	ok. for school you dont want to look too made up. you didnt put your age but im guessing in middle school. ok, you kind of want to stay natural(or atlesat have that look). you can still look great with very little make up on. heres what you do!<br>  1~for yours eyes Id layer browns(darkest brown in crease, medium brown on lid, light shimmer brown crease to brow) i would also put on mascara(your color choice)<br>  2~for your lips just do a gloss or a tinted pink gloss<br>  3~for your face( only if you NEED it) put it on this way<br>  ~~~1-put creme or liquid concealer/coverup on troubled spots<br>  ~~~2-rub in<br>  ~~~3-put a light layer of powder on your whole face<br>  ~~~4-blend in(otherwise youll look cakey)<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped|`|CI9J6x3daa	Well lets see, <br>  <br>  - a little bit of eyeliner do not over do it<br>  - mascara<br>  - lipgloss<br>  =D thats what I wear<br>  and its not much at all<br>  Dont overdue it dont wear alot cause then your face will break out <br>  make sure you take it off all of it off when you get home or done with whatever you are doing that day dont wear it to bed|`|fCSGDpROaa	Youtube has a lot of talented makeup artists<br>  <br>  Here are some of my favorites-<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/makeupgeektv?blend=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/makeupgeektv...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/allthatglitters21?blend=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/allthatglitt...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/dazzling232" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/dazzling232</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/panacea81?blend=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/panacea81?bl...</a><br>  <br>  And here is a video for a school look-<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klX1vpo4yCk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klX1vpo4y...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBybKgLMe54" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBybKgLMe...</a>|`|TXmAx8jwaa	Could you tell me what you use at the moment? it might help more to know if you were mascara, lip gloss etc.<br>  You should were some eyeshadow, a black base liquid liner, foundation ( if you need it ) and lip gloss. also add some mascara and bronzer. <br>  <br>  x

Most stores just measure you to fit the sizes of their bras that they sell so you might be able to get fitted with a good one.<br>  <br>  If not you can go with the larger cup size but go down in back size. <br>  e.g: if you are a 36B (But cup size is a little too small) try a 34C. <br>  <br>  This was what I was taught when being trained to fit bras at a lingerie store.<br>  <br>  I would always advise trying on bras before you buy them - and you get what you pay for so it's worth investing in some brand makes like Gossard as the quality is far better.|`|1d729bf4d6b38d30422b14b8a730ea1aaa	Different shops will measure you differently so it may be worth going and getting it done again, somewhere else.  Also, different makes of bra will be different in their sizes so it's worthwhile going into a department store and trying on lots until you find one that fits.|`|jqSxV9lKaa	HAHA im a C and a D so its kinda hard for me to find the right bra size..so umm i think yu should go to a bra store & they can help yu out.|`|of34r2siaa	There are half-size bras.

I'm not suggesting that you don't buy it, but if you do, look into some hair products that will put the nutrients back into your hair. I preferably use leave in conditioner after I'm done straightening it and when I was it I use Pantene Pro V Shampoo (it helps restore 2yrs of damage) and Dove Conditioner that's suppose to make your hair a h-e-l-l of alot smoother, after awhile you don't notice it but it definatly helps keep the frizz down.

441GSyaMaa	Tell people [parents or tip off the police], I hate thieves. They're scum. I don't care what anyone says.<br>  <br>  1 - Why should upstanding people like me and [from what I can assume] yourself pay for items out of money that we've earnt and such when people come out and just steal it here there and everywhere, and get away with it, until the one time they get caught (and whatever punishment they receive it won't make up the money of the same value of stolen goods they have acquired)<br>  <br>  2 - People who steal make it worse for people like us for the fact that the businesses wil then have to make their prices higher because there is less profit as the company has payed for something, it's stolen - so they need to make their profit targets - so prices will be higher. <br>  <br>  You don't need friends like tat, they'll only either get you into trouble or blame things on you because she sounds like that sort of bully kind of person who would just see you as a push over, I could be wrong - but the amount of times I have seen this situation, it's getting tiresome :-P|`|MHg9JhEKaa	I know it's tough when she's your mate, but do you want to be the one who's with her when she gets caught? <br>  <br>  I would tell her that you're worried, that you don't want to lose her, but that you can't go shopping with her unless she promises not to steal. <br>  <br>  If she refuses or tries to convince you it's ok, then perhaps you do need to consider if you want to be friends with her?

I didn't steal anything so of course I had nothing on me so they had to let me go.<br>  <br>  She told me all the stuff was taken of her, her mum was phoned to collect her and she was given a warning (which may not sound like much but he said if she got caught again she would be charged).  She was grounded for 3 months and her birthday was in that time, her mum returned all of her expensive presents, tv dvd player jewellery, perfume all she got were clothes that she needed.<br>  <br>  I suggest you show my answer to your friend to show her what could happen.<br>  <br>  If she want all of this stuff tell her to go and get a saturday job or ask her parents if she could have pocket money each week for doing choirs.  Although she may think it isn't a big deal if she continues this she will end up getting caught and it will effect her whole future such as people knowing she is a thief so therefore won't trust her and her job prospects <br>  <br>  no one wants to hire a thief|`|nqkXE1cUaa	Tell a manager or call the police, or tell her parents but ask them to keep your name anonymous.|`|aSs0tfjUaa	I see the following choices, none are pleasant but life is not perfect;<br>  <br>  1) End the friendship and stay away from her.<br>  <br>  2) Stay friends but never go shopping with her again.<br>  <br>  3) Tell her how you feel, that she is putting you in a position where you may get arrested when she gets caught.

If you don't, and if she gets caught, you could be partly responsible because you knew she was doing something wrong and you didn't say anything. If you don't know where to start, talk to your friend first. Tell her that if she doesn't tell someone within a given time frame (say, 2 weeks), you will tell someone for her. When people shoplift, the store loses money on the merchandise that people steal. So, the store owners raise the prices of items so they can get the money back that was lost. Talk to your friend. If she is upset because you don't back her up with what she is doing, she is not really your friend.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|ugXymVAhaa	You have to talk to her about it you could make it "jokey" talk but you have to tell her how you feel, i mean if you happy with having a friend who shoplifts its your choice but if not then you have to tell her.<br>  <br>  P.S. by no means am i saying what she did was right, if that was my friend ill tell her stop then again I doubt I could be friends with a shoplifter.<br>  <br>  best of luck|`|A5ZQmmW1aa	You don't want to lose her but to be honest, just by associating with her, you could end up in trouble too.  It's only a matter of time before she starts asking you to "put" things in your bag for her.  And it will start off innocently - she'll tell you her bag is too small.  Or she might even start sharing some of her "purchases" with you, which could get your parents suspicious if you suddenly turn up with new jewellery that is out of your normal price range.  Maybe try and distance yourself from her for a while - be very busy for the next few weekends with your family.|`|Dg0YKEQyaa	This is not stealing if you dont get caught its just permenantly borrowing.Did you know all shops increase their price to accomadate for losses due to theft.<br>  This just makes me angry and want to shoplift to get my monies worth.<br>  You should not interfere with your friends unique adaptation of the  utopian dream.

The simple fact is that a lot of young people steal it's usually a phase. It could be from a number of things peer pressure to have the best things, the thrill of stealing itself the fact that she could get caught giving here an adrenaline rush. It's just the types of things young people do others drink others smoke they do alsorts to make there life more enjoyable. I'd suggest just trying to do more things with her that will give her that buzz. Also talk to her tell her you're uncomfortable with her doing it around you. If she's a good friend she will at least stop doing it around you and eventually she WILL be caught and then hopefully she will stop if not she will do her time and learn to regret it.|`|UCkluEDTaa	So you don't have the kind of relationship that you can't tell her? And she's your only friend? Aha. Funny "only friend" that is! That seem to me as if you are a very insecure and lonely person and you cling to her because you don't have anybody else. No criticism here, but do you really rather want somebody who will drag you into no good than being alone for some time and look for another friend? She knows your situation, and she's using you. I wouldn't trust her at all! In the end, if she gets caught, she will blame it all on you and you will have a police record instead of her! Leg it girl as long as you can! You will find a real friend! XX|`|WWK6iWYNaa	I think you should say something to her, tell her the situation she is going to get herself into.<br>  Maybe then she might have second thoughts.

They will bust her, and everyone shopping with her, you do not need a freind getting you in all that trouble. It is hard when you dont have many friends. You can tell a white lie and say you have already been through this with anoher friend, and how much trouble you got in, and cant see that person *who moved so she doesnt know them, and mom wont let you hang out or go visit that person, tell her you have fun together so please dont do that anymroe when your around. She may listen and you wont lose that friend, if she gets upset and lies saying she did not do it, she will most likely steal from you too someday, and that is not a friend.
LeHpIFwyaa	You have to follow the dress code of your school.  Most of the codes are made up by the school board, trustees, and/or school personal.  <br>  <br>  How many of the school personal do you see with facial piercings?  It is a social taboo.  It can also be seen as distracting like bad language on a t-shirt, bright colored hair, or short skirts.  They want you to be presentable and teach you how to fit in the real world work place.  Look around at professionals and how many do you see with large tattoos or facial piercings?  In the retail stores and upscale businesses  how many people do you see the piercings?  There are always exceptions and if your business caters to "individuals" who have piercings then they hire people with like tastes.  Water seeks its own level.<br>  <br>  If this is a huge issue and you feel wronged and feel passionate about it then take your concerns to your local school board and ask them to review the dress code.  Be sure to have valid info to present and maybe a school petition or survey.  You never know what you can change if you never try.<br>  <br>  May you be blessed.|`|jeX5VZAtaa	They want to prepare you for the work industry. Most jobs do not allow piercings.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	The school I went to had the same rule. For them, it was purely down to the image of the school. It was a private school so essentially all their students were walking advertisements for other parents to want to send their child there. And what parent is going to pay thousands a year to send their child to a school full of 'rebels' (or so they would think). I know plenty of state schools which had the same rule though. And even though the 'walking advertisement' thing might not apply so much to government funded schools, they still have an image to uphold. And they have to be able to draw a line. It might be acceptible to wear a nose stud or a discreet lip stud. But who is to stop a student then walking in with twenty facial piercings? No school wants that kind of image attached to them, whether they're private or state funded. Pierced teenagers are associated with rebellion, rule breaking, not doing work. It's a stereotype I know but it isn't the schools that create those stereotypes, they just have to conform to them. Also as someone above correctly mentioned, the whole point of school is to prepare children for the 'real world'. Going there 8 hours a day is like having a full time job in a way, and in most full time jobs you are not able to wear facial piercings, and so this is good preparation for that. It doesn't stop you having a piercing in the summer holidays, then taking it out by the time it's healed for school, and putting it in when you get home.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	Because your school is trying to keep it's students looking well-kept and clean cut, and other piercings can be distracting. Imagine going to a school where all the kids were tattooed and pierced, no one would take it seriously. Some things are just not appropriate for certain situations, and while I think that certain piercings should be allowed (for example, at my high school we were not allowed to have cartilage piercings) I understand where the school is coming from about not allowing kids to have tongue piercings, lip piercings, etc. Just wait until college, you can look however you want|`|6w7FKrlfaa	i got an eyebrow ring in year 12.. and a few days later there was a school meeting about facial piercings...  i didn't care.. anddd i didn't take it out..  but i guess they don't want people to have them because it makes that kid stand out..  and i suppose if they got caught or something, bumped... might cause problems..|`|6ts5esy8aa	i dont no at my school you can have watever you want i no ppl with over 15 tattoos in plain sight and i also no ppl that have piercings that  are also in plain sight|`|xT024KMsaa	Because they can be distracting. Same as any other dress codes.|`|QsC3qGkOaa	can u imagine if most of the students come to school with pierce on faces?<br>  school's rules and polices train us to be a disciplined young ones for the future and so they stand firm to teach you follow ethics.|`|wln56Dc4aa	well mine does...lol

gMKJmaUZaa	They're not going to "fade away". Highlights don't really "fade". They have nothing to fade too. So no, stopping the color shampoo won't make a difference, other than they won't be as vibrant. If you want to get rid of them, go to the salon, because they might need to be filled, and you don't want to end up with cotton-candy pink highlights on accident.|`|RqDAU64Haa	nope it wont fade them away completely. they will just look dull.

vJwCaiMCaa	It's all about the confidence you show. People tend to notice this, when someone feels good about themselves others will notice. <br>  I'm a plus size girl and i'm pretty confident. I get more attention from men then my skinny friends. So i guess yes plus size women can be attractive. But as the first poster stated you have to take care of yourself. dress well, look good, feel good. So help your friend to work on her confidence and show her how beautiful she really is.|`|oSA9Wsv1aa	There are those who are naturally large. I do find some attractive. Then there are those who let themselves go. Those women are lazy and are usually mean spirited because of what they have done to themselves. All in all they are just as attractive as any other woman. Persona and humor have a lot to do do with your over all attractiveness.<br>  Honesty stinks, but you asked.|`|992155b8fe8665d0f71938b6281333e5aa	It is the way a woman carries herself that makes her attractive.  Whether she is skinny, plus, or really plus matters to some degree upon first glance but then it is about confidence and personality to seal the interest.<br>  With that said I am more likely to want to learn about a person who is not too much on the plus side b/c I feel that their lifestyle is closer to mine.  I'm an active person.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Yes, but only one +....not a whole bunch of them|`|fYI1I8Bdaa	I believe SOME Plus size women are very attractive when they know HOW to dress and keep themselves looking and smelling good!<br>  <br>  Society teach us to cater to being thin......but everyone is not made that way.<br>  <br>  A Perfect example is Star Jones............she was soooo PRETTY.....as a plus size girl......FROM HEAD TO TOE!.....but after that surgery.........WHEW!   it's not for everybody to be thin.<br>  <br>  So tell your friend............love herself........just the way she is..........and if she want to lose some weight.................she have to love herself along the journey with the weight and as she lose the weight.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps<br>  <br>  Victory of Creativehairillusions|`|IxLkAEA3aa	some of them are gorgeous! as long as you have a pretty face and personality it doesnt matter what size you are sounds cleche but im serious<br>  <br>  nd|`|naySyzfQaa	It's all about the confidence factor. It just oozes out of some women, even if they're plus size. It's not even about weight because some average size women have self-esteem issues.Reassure her that she's a good-looking woman and if she has the right attitude any man would be lucky to have her in his life.|`|Thw2IgxQaa	It depends. Can their face be attractive? Of course. Can overweight bodies be attractive? It can be, but since "plus sized" women are overweight it's not likely.
x02jsjg6aa	Your hair probably is in terrible shape because you spend way too much time on it- really.  I know, when I was a teenager I had icky dry hair that I spent a lot of time on.<br>  <br>  Wash once a week, use Pantene for dry hair, it is an excellent product.  Straighten your hair one day and then let it be until your next shampoo.  If you straighten or wash more than that, you will continue to have the nasty mess of hair you have right now, NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF PRODUCTS YOU USE.<br>  <br>  When it's wintertime and I flat iron my naturally curly, color treated hair, I shampoo every two weeks.  It is softer and shinier than when I washed it weekly.  And it doesn't get gross at all- I'm actually a clean freak.  In the summertime when I let it curl, I shampoo once a week.  If you don't take this advice, nothing can help you.|`|1WG0iCQWaa	You cannot make overprocessed hair healthy again. You can add artificial shine and softening, but it will come out with shampooing. Get a cut that doesn't require so much styling.|`|lJZNGsZCaa	My mate has very curly frizzy hair she uses john freedas collection for frizzy hair it seems to keep it healthy looking|`|AA10041941	not 1 shampoo or conditioner can do all that for your hair...you'll have to get the split ends cut off..sounds like you've really fried it.. you may want to cut down on the iron for awhile|`|pwXK9A4haa	finesse, finesse, finesse! If you are not satisfied I'll pay you back.|`|MPVzLmAsaa	Well it depends, no offense but are you black or white? I am half white and half Jamaican and I use Pantene Shampoo, Conditioner, Sheen Spray and Treatment for Women of Color. It helps a lot! My hair used to be so frizzy, poffy and damaged that I had to cut it all off. If your ends are really fried from straightening it to much, than cut off all of the dead ends. My hair used to be very very long then I learned and used the straightener. If you are colored, you should really only wash your hair once a week at the most. I know it sounds gross, but your hair grows and relpenishes itself when it is dirty. If you do sports, than definetly wash it after a game or something.
7bf7fbd4987902f29965a776571e4aaaaa	You didn't say what you want your hair to do, but it sounds like you need a different haircut. The JF shine serum, Chi Silk Infusion, Fructis Sleek and Shine, and the Super Skinny are all the same thing. I would try a different leave-in, but again, it sounds like you need a different haircut/style.

9ZvHsIFfaa	Yeah lots of food with protein, eat nuts,seeds, fish oil, eat loads of fruit and drink only water and you'll have the shiniest hair around|`|sQqGpRXtaa	Lots of protein reach foods. they help your fingernails as well.|`|KjQaxGX0aa	Hello the thing with hair is that it is pre-programmed to come out the way it is.  You can have straight, curly, wavy, kinky, thin, medium, thick or coarse hair. This can have a lot to do with its appearance and the way you look after it.  A varied diet with all essential food groups won't do any harm, but no particular food will aid your hair.  Things like perms, blow drying, styling products, illness, stress, tiredness, can all be detrimental.  Just looking at the answer about shiny hair believe me it is genetics and a good diet that gives you this.

Os secos sofrem mais, mas todos os tipos de cabelo - normais , oleosos, mistos, ondulados ou lisos - est?o sujeitos a perder o aspecto saudável devido ao excesso de sol, vento, cloro, água do mar, polui??o, tinturas, escovas ou chapinhas.<br>  <br>  Estes agentes externos abrem as escamas da cutícula capilar, permitindo a saída das moléculas de água que hidratam os fios. No finalzinho do ver?o, ent?o, s?o visíveis os estragos causados pelos prazeres desfrutados na esta??o mais quente do ano. Como resultado dos danos à estrutura capilar, os fios tornam-se ressecados, opacos e quebradi?os. <br>  <br>  Segundo a dermatologista Karla Saggioro, de S?o Paulo, a hidrata??o é a principal arma para combater estes efeitos maléficos. "A hidrata??o faz com que as escamas arrepiadas se ajeitem, melhorando a textura", explica. Além das técnicas feitas em sal?es de beleza, é possível declarar guerra à fragilidade e à falta de brilho no conforto do lar. é que avan?os tecnológicos felizmente aposentaram aqueles antigos coquetéis que empastavam os fios. <br>  <br>  Hoje os cremes de tratamento intensivo s?o uma forma prática de devolver a vitalidade aos fios. "Eu gosto muito dos que levam queratina, aminoácidos da seda ou silicone (este impermeabiliza o fio, fazendo com que ele retenha maior quantidade de água na superfície)", explica a dermatologista Adriana Villarinho, de S?o Paulo. No mercado há várias formula??es específicas para o tipo e o estado dos fios, como os indicados para cabelos fracos, quebradi?os, longos, cacheados, com tratamentos químicos ou tinturas, que permitem acertar no alvo com mais facilidade. "O grande segredo é realmente escolher o produto certo", recomenda a profissional. <br>  <br>  Na hora de aplicar, é preciso observar as recomenda??es de cada fabricante. "O ideal é lavar o cabelo, passar o creme e fazer algo para aumentar a temperatura, como touca térmica, para que o fio se abra e o produto penetre. é especialmente indicado que a aplica??o seja feita em meio úmido, como vapor, para que o calor n?o fa?a com que o fio perca água para o meio externo, o que pode prejudicar o resultado", diz Villarinho. <br>  <br>  Há dois cuidados que devem ser seguidos à risca. O primeiro é jamais aplicar o creme nas raízes, sempre passando do ter?o do comprimento em dire??o às pontas. A precau??o evita o excesso de oleosidade nas raízes, que pode até desencadear quadros de queda. O segundo é realmente limitar-se ao tempo prescrito pelo fabricante. "Como a hidrata??o é feita em casa, muitas pessoas acabam deixando mais tempo do que deveriam", adverte Villarinho. A hidrata??o excessiva, em vez de embelezar as melenas, pode deixá-las oleosas. <br>  <br>  A freqüência depende das condi??es de cada cabelo, variando de semanal (para os extremamente danificados) até a cada dois meses. "O ideal é fazê-la quinzenalmente", receita Saggioro, que explica que este cuidado vale ouro no aspecto geral da cabeleira.|`|kTJE3TZVaa	Hidrata??o na cabelera cara!!!!|`|MogAm5i3aa	primeiro uma boa hidrata??o.|`|VNO5nlpvaa	pomada pra qualquer cabelo.. cera dexa o cabelo pesado|`|bqIkrLvVaa	Hidratar é a melhor op??o.|`|zhJIuJTRaa	n?o fasso a mínima idéia.........................

AA11125582	I have the same type of hair and this is what I do.  If I want my hair really curly, but nto crunchy I use Catwalk's "Curls Rock".  If I want more loose curls I go with V05's Curvaceous mousse.  If I want my hair to dry somewhat smooth, but not be curly just wavy I use Loreal's straight and smooth cream.  I find that it really depends on the shampoo and conditioner too.  I like the Sleek and Smooth line by Matrix or the Dove line.  Good Luck!|`|AA10146978	I think Pantene Pro-v is exactly what you'll want!! Anything in their mousse range will give you a beautiful natural effect. It will look wet and crunchy at first while your hair is still damp, but after a couple of hours or so, it leaves hair soft and natural.|`|LHA6iWjHaa	as for myself I straighten my hair everyday and use only straitening products so I don't really know of any new products, but I used to wear the curly look and my stylist suggested a product by Sebastian called potion number 9 which is for that soft curl look. I liked it because it left my hair with soft curls (I don't like that hard curl wet look either). If not that, maybe you can try some leave-in conditioner.
hqSWUc8uaa	An option would be to use a semi permanent hair color, which would be something that would gradually wash/fade out over a month or 2, depending on how often you wash your hair.<br>  <br>  Now, you can't lighten with a semi-permanent color, but you can go darker or experiment with different shades... like, if you wanted to be a red-brown or a golden brown, you could do stuff like that.<br>  <br>  I don't, however, advise you to do this at home with store-bought color. Many colors advertised as "semi-permanent" are actually "demi-permanent" which is not the same. Demi-permanent hair color does fade out, but not completely. A true semi-permanent color is color that comes in ONE bottle, and you open it and put it on and process it and wash it out. If you open the box and you have to mix 2 or more bottles together, you have either a demi-permanent color or a permanent color. If you go to a salon and have it done, you can be sure that you are getting what you want. (plus, hair color correction is WAAAAY more expensive than what it costs to just have it done at a salon in the first place!)<br>  <br>  So this way you can kind of experiment without the commitment to one color until it grows out.<br>  <br>  Offer to do extra chores around the house to earn the money to get your hair done. That will butter her up, lol ;)|`|KpvyKxflaa	Buy some dye and do it yourself. Once you did it there is nothing she can do.|`|XyhK9dr5aa	You can get 28 wash dies as well as 8.<br>  or you could ask her for highlights. If you get enough it can give your hair the appearance of a different colour, and it is safer.|`|GJFU1CHGaa	ask her for  semi dye ...<br>  but dying your hair ruins your hair anyways, i wish i never died mine, and listened to my mother.|`|NEnmSAdSaa	She probably won't let you because it's against your school rules. I dye my hair a ton and I go to a Catholic school, so I got a detention but whatever. My mom let me though. Ask her if she'll let you do it during Summer. And maybe dye it without her knowing closer to the end of Summer so you'll still have it at the beginning of school but you'll just be like, "It wouldn't fade enough!"|`|NzU8q8XMaa	No because we aren't your Mommies. It's up to her!!!|`|QM9LmWjmaa	Respect your mom and her decisions...you might think that she just doesn't care, but she just wants the best for you!! Trust me!!!: )

VsLSJ65Paa	Most people get the hypotrophic scarring in cartilage piercings . Its normal dont worry.  If it really bothers you , go see a dermatoligist to have it removed.|`|oOQUba3paa	i just recently had the same problem. my doctor told me to take it out actually. it was infected. that's what the bump was. wait until it heals, then you can re pierce it.|`|Vo4tcSf3aa	ok well the bump is normal i have mine done and its the same but....mine never closes when i take it out i got it done last april...i would say go get it done again and ask the if they say no you have another ear...get that one done.|`|EaSEjCMZaa	You shouldn't have taken it out so soon. When you get your cartilage pierced or any ear piercing, the minimum amount of time to keep the same earring in is 2-3 months, 4-6 months for a cartilage. You can take it out for a very short amount of time after this, maybe like 10 minutes max before it'll start to close but you're better off having an earring there at ALL times for the first year after your cartilage's been pierced. The bump is typically normal for a cartilage piercing because it's filled with white blood cells helping to heal the hole. While the earring is still in the hole, my friend said that she pressed on the bump so the pus will come out onto the earring (I know, I know...ew lol) and then you'll need to clean it with sea-salt water solution and it'll go away and be just fine. Since you took the earring out, however, the bump may stay there way longer then you'd like because the pus is backed up in there. I don't recommend getting it re-pierced in the same spot or it may cause problems.
Hx5ugKZnaa	Woah.. I definitely think you need to accessorise!!<br>  You've got the basics that every wardrobe needs but you need to buy a few pieces that are a bit more ''out there'' and show off your personality. By adding colour and/or patterns to your wardrobe it would allow you to mix and match your outfits and also brighten up your wardrobe.<br>  I suggest you buy a magazine like ''LOOK'' and take a few ideas from there.<br>  Dresses, tops and cardigans are always a safe choice when bought from Topshop as they wont date and can be used to create any look.<br>  Accessories such as belts and scarfs can be bought from Primark as they are cheap but look great with any outfit.<br>  Most of all shopping should be fun.. go out window shopping with a friend and have a laugh trying clothes on to find out what really suits you.<br>  <br>  xx|`|tUu5N2vcaa	find out whats your fav colors.<br>  then look at celebs and ask yourself would you wear that<br>  also when shopping look for items  that you like note down that style and in time your true style will emerge|`|JICougt3aa	u really need to invest in some brighter colours, keep to plain bright clothes and then accessorize. i always think someone with nice nails hair and makeup and good accessorize always looks the best, u dont have to spend loads either.......... just stick to these simple rules...... n not too many patterns.... xxx

5kK2f9Utaa	I started out using cheap makeup that really did not help me at all lol before switching to Bare Minerals. I ran out and started using Almay, it was in a round container with a sponge inside it (the best makeup ever but they don't make it anymore!!) and then I went back to Bare Minerals. Ran out of it again and started using more Almay but this time its the kind that goes on white and then blends in. I'm back to Bare Minerals but any liquid I use is Almay because its light and when I put a powder over it (I have oily skin so I use powder as well) it doesn't look heavy at all. Try switching makeup to see what works best for you. It took me a while to find a brand/type that helped me but once you know it, you'll be set.<br>  <br>  Also, try using less powder. You don't need a lot to get the job done. A little goes a long way :) I have sensitive skin so I'm always careful of what I use and how I use it.|`|ku5NPnkfaa	Yeah it looks better that way I like to use the Dream Matte Mouse or something like that they have really good foundation and powder anad the foundation is really good.|`|Bx82t8SRaa	yea i feel weird if i don't|`|MrizzMDhaa	Liquid to powder foundations and dream matte mousse definitely don't need powder - it just makes them look too chalky. But I use powder on top of more creamy shiny foundation - it helps to 'set' the make up and really extends the wearing time. I have fair skin and a make up artist told me never to use translucent powder, always to use a light shade instead.|`|aaebb9ddf7ee02705c8714bb2d74bc81aa	no you shouldnt use foundation try mineral makeup by cover girl all that extra makeup is not good it clogs your pores and causes break outs|`|CLm2dX1faa	Yes always it sets the foundation. lightly dust if you use too much then it clot|`|90bebc89ee072c1f94915d47a65c7565aa	If you use a brush to apply a minimal coat of powder then wait 10 minutes for it to set into your skin, It shouldn't look so weird. Once it sets into your skin, It shouldn't have that fake dusty look your probably seeing.<br>  But, if you absolutely refuse to use powder, try Maybelline matte mousse or the new liquid dream mousse. I don't use powder for those and i've tried both. I usually end up buffing them smooth with a CLEAN powder brush after I've applied it though, because it makes it look a lot smoother.|`|peMRRQHFaa	I always find max factor very good. Apply using a make up brush - not your fingers, and if you do need to use powder, use loose powder and a dusting brush. :-)|`|4u8YVgMmaa	just try maybelline dream matte mousse!! its better than all other foundations and it looks perfect on the face.don't apply powder over the foundation.
hqSWUc8uaa	I would not use it... I would have it professionally done. <br>  <br>  I have not used it on myself personally, but as a stylist, I've seen the damage it (and other "over the counter" brand colors) can do to people's hair. <br>  <br>  The reason that many of them are so harsh is for a couple reasons... first off, many "OTC" colors have VERY high amounts of ammonia in them... permanent hair color needs to have *some* ammonia in it in order for it to work, but many brands over-do it, and that's SOOOO damaging to your hair.<br>  <br>  Second, many OTC dyes have bases of metallic salts, which is very hard on the hair. The color literally has ground up metal in it, which is what is "supposed" to make your hair shiny. I did a test strand for a perm one time because the lady had Nice & Easy on her hair (another metallic dye) and her test strand, after soaking in perm solution for about 5 mins, LITERALLY turned to metal shards... it was unbelievable!!! (so this is another reason...it's very hard to do perms over it for this reason and it's also very hard to remove from hair for this reason... the chemical reactions are just so harsh, your hair could fry majorly or break off completely!!!)<br>  <br>  Also a good reason to go to a salon and have it done is... hair color is SO unpredictable. It's not as easy as just slapping a color on and ta-da! you're done!... No, no no... your natural undertones have to be taken into account, what undertones you want to see, what ones you don't want to see, how light or how dark you'd like to go in comparison to your starting point... Also if you DO a home color and need to get it fixed, it costs WAAAAAY more to get fixed than just coming to a salon and getting it done right in the first place!!!<br>  (for instance, my salon charges $45 starting for a basic color... more for highlights... but a CORRECTIVE color starts at $90 and that's for 2 hours of work... if you go over that, it's an additional $30-35 per hour... so if your hair is majorly f*cked up... you better bring lotsa money to get it fixed!!!)<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!|`|U5icuT5qaa	there are lotsa brands that u can buy at places like CVS and stuff, and even though it says so, that stuff is not permanent and will fade. i suggest u go 2 a professional|`|fFIJekj3aa	please go to the salon to get your hair colored!|`|WEIITPyzaa	yeah, it was good, i really like the color
hqSWUc8uaa	all people, long or short hair, curly or straight, black or blonde hair, dry or oily hair... all people lose an average of 50-100 strands of hair a day. Your doctor is right, everything is fine. It's when you notice PATCHES of hair missing to start worrying.<br>  <br>  And worrying about it probably isn't helping you... that's one thing that will make more fall out!

Braiding hair that hasn’t been washed that day and already has hair products in it also works well.<br>  <br>  Step 2:<br>  <br>  Divide tangle-free hair into three even sections. Place the left section between your left index finger and thumb, let the middle section hang free and place the right section between your right index finger and thumb. This will begin to create the hair braids.<br>  <br>  Step 3:<br>  <br>  Grab the middle section with your right middle finger and pull it so it passes behind the right section. Extend your right thumb and index finger so the portion of hair therein becomes the middle section.<br>  <br>  Step 4:<br>  <br>  Use the left middle finger to pull the middle section behind the left section. Extend or straighten the left index finger and thumb to make the left section become the middle section. Pay careful attention to the smoothness and tension of your hair braid sections.<br>  <br>  Step 5:<br>  <br>  Shift the portion of hair hooked in the right middle finger so it sits between the right index finger and thumb. Repeat the process, then shift the portion of the hair hooked in the left middle finger so it sits between the left index finger and thumb.<br>  <br>  Step 6:<br>  <br>  Continue until you achieve the desired length of the hair braid. Make a tighter, more compact braid by pulling the middle section into a horizontal line as you pull it to the right or left. For a loose, elongated braid, simply shift the middle section to the right or left, letting it remain in a vertical line.<br>  <br>  Step 7:<br>  <br>  Tie off the ends of the hair braid with a covered rubber band. Add a bow or barrette when appropriate.<br>  <br>  You can find good hair weaving / braiding information at below blog. It will definitely help you.

nqGB8DPLaa	i love this stuff. it makes my hair feel like silk. i've heard it makes curly hair easier to manage and makes it look healthier. i guess it depends if your hair is naturally curly or if you are going to curl it with rollers. if your hair is naturally curly, it should work great.|`|XVSCXIBzaa	It worked for me!<br>  Try the repairing lotion, I also used the All Soft deep conditioner, it made my hair super soft!|`|hqSWUc8uaa	I like the All Soft, personally. If you do have damaged and/or dry hair, all soft is WONDERFUL. However, if you're not looking to straighten your hair, if you're just looking to tame it down a little bit, I wouldn't use the All Soft. It may be TOO moisturizing. I would use the Clear Moisture (by Redken) or the Fresh Curls (also by Redken). Then I would get the All Soft deep conditioner (I forget what it's called right now... Heavy Cream, I think...?) and use that once a week (or once every 2 weeks) for a deep conditioning treatment.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope this helps you!
H1aJk6bCaa	I like Nioxin Bliss Thermal Protector.  I like it because it protects your hair because it has proteins in it that get "cooked" into your hair when you use a flat iron.  There are other silicon based drops like CHI, BioSilk Therapy drops, Redken Macademia Nut Smoothing Serum, Matrix smoothing serum.  These are all great, they make your hair look shinny.  My only problem with them is that they make your hair "LOOK" shiny and healthy.  My suggestion is to spray on the Nioxin Bliss Thermal Protector first (it's like vitamins for your hair), then use one of the silicon based drops above to seal in the vitamins from the nioxin.  <br>  <br>  With the silicon based drops (they are better than bare hair to a flat iron), but they don't actually provide a lot of nourishment to the hair, they just coat it an make it look better.  (Sorta like painting your nails with a clear polish).  It is better to feed the hair and nails with vitamins first and then coat it as well.  Split ends are inevitable if the hair is old and damaged by styling irons on a regular basis, but you can reduce the harmful effects of styling with hot irons by using the spray and the drops.<br>  <br>  Here are some links to Folica <a href="http://www.folica.com/Nioxin_Volumizi_d3262.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Nioxin_Volumizi_d3...</a><br>  <br>  Here are different types of silicon based drops available on the market.<br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/CHI_Silk_Infusi_d2300.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/CHI_Silk_Infusi_d2...</a>  <br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/got2b_Glossy_An_d1484.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/got2b_Glossy_An_d1...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/Redken_Smooth_D_d2148.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Redken_Smooth_D_d2...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/Redken_Glass_Sm_d2129.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Redken_Glass_Sm_d2...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/Frizz_Ease_Hair_d354.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Frizz_Ease_Hair_d3...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/Zero_Frizz_Extr_d239.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Zero_Frizz_Extr_d2...</a><br>  <br>  Some like Zero-Frizz and got2b will be available at CVS although I much prefer the REdken and some of the other brands available at salons.

JlK5DbD7aa	As a hairstylist myself, I had numerous clients that did this too. It's not a big deal, I promise. They won't laugh at you either.  Just tell your stylist what you did and why you did it, and they should be able to give you some advise as to how to style it and or fix it for you.|`|84rAdH3paa	Dont worry about it i hated how fat my eyebrows were so I shaves them and I shaved them all off!!!<br>  they will under stand so just dont worry they will just tell you some things like you can ask your hair dresser if there is anything you can do..<br>  Just be brave they won't laugh i promise and if they do go to someone else because thats not rite..<br>  I really hope I help!!!|`|IyfeeSLzaa	maybe you can get some side bangs|`|VYpVrPluaa	explain what you did. they will be understanding and will help you come up with a plan to fix it/hide it. think about it, you're paying them, they're not going to make fun of you because that will loose them buisness|`|27f16a1a2275258802b78014bc189e59aa	i did that once. it grows in, and you'll never do it again. until then don't sweat it, maybe the person who cuts your hair can help you style it so no one else sees.
hqSWUc8uaa	I'm not certain if they make different sizes of 3-barrel irons/wavers but if they do, get one that's larger in size (the barrels will be bigger, and it should say a size on it) I myself have only seen one size but that doesn't mean that other sizes don't exist!!! :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!

wPnJekdqaa	As a fellow crossdresser, I have similar reservations about wearing a mini in public. It feels great wearing one in private and makes you feel super confident and girly, but then I think about going outdoors and it's a different story.<br>  <br>  But then I thought the same the first time I ever wore any item of women's clothing and over time that's almost gone entirely now. Hopefully as I wear a mini around the house more, I'll learn how to look more natural in it and not expose myself at every opportunity. <br>  <br>  Having said that, I don't think I'd ever wear a mini skirt out in public unless it was to a club because TVs in mini skirts look extremely obvious.|`|5jsMY4RIaa	I feel cute, summery, and flirty.

Read the label that says Sold only in Professional Salons. Go get a hair service done and ask them to use some Redken products to see if you like them!|`|hqSWUc8uaa	The Smoothing system works good for help with straightening. If you're looking for softening, the All Soft or Extreme is great, but only if your hair is MAJORLY dry... if it's only kinda dry, the Clear Moisture is good.<br>  <br>  Redken products are AWESOME compared to most... good choice! If you have any other questions, stop in at a salon that sells Redken, and ask a stylist for her/his opinion & recommendation... that's the best way to do it! :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4BRx40y9aa	My sister and I use it for lasting hold in our wavy hair.

If your pore is clogged, say with microscopic dirt or dead skin cells, the oil is trapped.  It takes time for blackheads to form as the oil dries out and gets stuck so it will take time to turn this around, but here are some hints:<br>  <br>  Drink lots of water to flush and hydrate your skin<br>  <br>  Wash gently with warm water and mild cleanser morning and night, possibly mid day and any time you've been perspiring or exercising.  <br>  <br>  Use a salicylic acid cleanser ever other day - this cleanser eats through a little bit of the top layer of skin to ensure dead cells aren't flaking all the time.  You can increase this after a couple weeks to daily.  There are many good products at the drugstore and supermarket that contain this ingredient - nice little pads that are convenient to use.<br>  <br>  Splash your face with aloe vera moisturizer after washing - don't neglect this mild moisturizer or your skin will respond by producing more oil.<br>  <br>  Eat fresh fruits and veggies, cut the junk food which contains impurities that your body must dispose of.  Guess what?  Your skin is considered an organ and is responsible for disposing of impurities, so give it less work to do.  <br>  <br>  Believe it or not the suggestion for sulfa dog remedy is valid, too, but I recommend you improve your diet to include sulfer rich foods.  Work from the inside out by eating more: broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, onions, garlic, leeks, scallions, eggs, beans, nuts and seeds, asparagus, avocado, tomato, sweet potato, spinach, parsley and tumeric.<br>  <br>  Take a multi vitamin everyday, one that has a good amount of b-vitamins.<br>  <br>  As for popping, don't tear you face up trying to pry out a dry blockage - the texture of your facecloth should slowly work away the excess oils.  <br>  <br>  Smile!|`|Y5zwd3dkaa	-NEVER pop them out and i mean NEVER <br>  -DON'T wash your face with regular soap because it dries out your skin<br>  -use Clean&clear , their products are amazing ! i've been using it for the last 3 years and my skin is perfect and everyone keeps complimenting me about it !<br>  -wash your face with only WATER at morning , and wash your face with only water at night ( then apply the moisturizer or cream )<br>  <br>  <3|`|wb9BBKzRaa	Squeeze squeeze squeeze.

Usually that means the skin is too dry.  If you're sure the skin is well-moisturized, try buying a tan accelerating lotion.  Use one that is level 2 or 3 on your legs only.  They usually tingle, and sometimes even feel "prickly."  After you get out, your legs may look red, but it will fade.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes the skin on your legs is just tougher than on your arms or back.  Ask the tanning salon's staff to pick out a good level 2 or 3 accelerator for you.  Tell them you're having trouble tanning your legs.  Also, see if they've changed the bulbs lately, or if they have a booth with stronger bulbs than the one you use.|`|aA0Mcivaaa	Legs on women do not seem to keep their color because we are always shaving<br>  <br>   (which exfoliates your skin faster & the faster you exfoliate, the quicker you lose your tan).<br>  <br>   Keep your skin very well moisturized & use high quality body washes instead of bar soaps (which dry out your skin).|`|WGXllYp5aa	Becuase after the shower your pours are open so when you put tan on straight away the tan will go into your pours and leave your legs patchy!

My brother, skates, and he looks tight in his.  So, I would say, go ahead and wear your boxers.  If doesn't matter if they are loose, you can't really tell.  If you wear briefs, those are ok too!!  But, my brother uses skinny leg, and wears boxers.  Hopes this helps!!!|`|fELUJmkvaa	ha ha!  This is a funny one.  I say skinny underwear, i.e., close-fitting underwear.  I would say fitted boxers.

hqSWUc8uaa	I can't tell you what to get, but I can tell you what NOT to get...<br>  <br>  Stay away from rubber or rubber-coated holders (latex is better, doesn't snag and break the hair)<br>  Also make sure they don't have those little metal ends on them that connect one end to the other... those little metal thingies can break off your hair, too.<br>  Perhaps a big jaw clip would be better than a pony-tain holder...? Just a thought!<br>  <br>  <br>  Wish I could be of more help... good luck!|`|nNQa0MHBaa	I get the basic goody brand elastic hair ties. The thick ones not the thin. They don't have metal holding them together. BUT all hairties are going to stretch (you use something enough you are going to wear it out) unless you use a hair clip.. but they are cheap enough and come in big enough packs.. when one stretched out too much for me.. i toss it and get another one. When I run out.. i buy another pack.

Your darker hair really brings out your eyes though... =)|`|fa50ab4d87b43f6b3141ab3c46e7e25daa	Yes, or I would even go lighter than that- If you go to a salon, have them use golden brown or golden ash brown as a base, golden blonde and lightest ash blonde or lightest golden blonde as the highlights....if you are doing it yourself, buy the 3 different colors, and put the golden brown all over your head, then comb in golden blonde for highlights and then use the lightest golden blonde on your bangs and around your face only.

Jn2OCVhlaa	Those dark spots on your cheeks are actually scars that are usually caused when a pimple gets infected or you pop it yourself. Most of them do fade naturally like any other scar, but there are a few ways to speed it up. Using vitamin E oil is one of them, you can buy it at the drugstore either in capsules that you have to break or in little jars. Another great product is Bio-Oil, also available at the drugstore, which I use myself and it has done wonders, you just apply it to your face at night and scars disappear within weeks. A home remedy you can use is lemon juice, which actually bleaches the skin.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Mix nutmeg powder with a little unboiled milk and apply on acne or pimples and wash after an hour this remedy when done once or twice a week for some time will not leave any acne marks on the skin .  More such solutions at  <a href="http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/</a>|`|xGkew2y3aa	you should never pop a pimple because it stains your face lol my mom all ways told me this and she's right... just us blackhead remover and it will fade after a few weeks it burns your skin off little by little then it will fade away
qo8SalPIaa	You can use any kind you want to, however, make sure they are the same guage. I had mine pierced with the "Pig tail" kind. I actually kept that one in for about 6 months and switched it to an "L" shaped one. After snagging it and pulling it almost all the way out (the bent part was showing) I wasnt able to put it back in. Crazy as it may sound, I have used some of the lil cheaper ones that are a straight bar ( with a small ball at the end) since then and havent had any issues.|`|BPrMusoLaa	I think they are the same just a diffrent shape, but you wanna wait til it fully heals anyway before you switch up.|`|FC4VXL4saa	L Shape is the best one to use, but you will be able to use a twist-in type of nose stud once your nose is completely healed

080934e29f274b8260654d8ae8456f65aa	They are loose shadows, or rather loose forms on colors that you can use on your face.  Not pigments are eye or lip safe.  Make sure you read the instruction or do research on a particular pigment before putting on your face.|`|btPPw1FHaa	Pigments are loose eyeshadows.

8fv3t0h3aa	mix tea or pomegranate juice with the henna. Or just put water but it wont look as good..
AA11189849	I love turtlenecks, too.  They have to fit snug and look incredible.  I agree.  I usually opt for silk blends.  Those stretch the best, feel incredible and maintain their shape.  Opt for ribbed t-necks. Those fit close to the bod and show off curves the best.<br>  Where to find:  Victoria's Secret (runs true to size), Ebay (believe it or not!) I actually found one (not silk blend but cotton) at Kmart that fit well. Not the silk blend quality but nice.  <br>  I also bought a Bebe t-neck that had teeny rhinestones w/ the logo on the chest area. So sexy.  Some Bebe turtlenecks have the logo on the sleeves which looks soooooo sexy.  Bebe runs small. (Junior sizing) You can get a good deal on Ebay if you know what you are looking for. <br>  Also, Victoria's Secret has turtleneck (t-neck) dresses that fit snug and are so flattering all sexy fitting.  Long and shorter lengths.  I have many in different lengths and colors. <br>  Good luck.|`|bde2dfefe3b3735e7df46de59b123dc9aa	Here's one that will blow your mind... Wal-Mart. Their basic cheap turtlenecks have a good amount of lycra blend to them, so the fit snug, and the collar and cuffs hold shape very well. Plus, they have tons of colors, (more in store than online) and you can get away with around $7 per shirt. 
kCu6Him8aa	First off, go back to the stylist! You NEVER cut your hair BEFORE a perm! Always after, for just this problem. I don't know if I'd go as far as getting your money back, but it's worth a try if you want. They do make curl removers. I bought one from Sally Beauty when my perm didn't want to fall out after 4 months. It worked well. I would go to the stylist, complain, and ask her how to take it out. She might have a better product. Then, find a new stylist! I gave the link for the curl remover if you want to just do it at home.|`|ncnRAW9Yaa	Wear it flat ironed until it improves to your liking.
DHRSLyv1aa	Try Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash. It's effective and great for sensitive skin. Not to mention reasonably priced. :)|`|s8TgY1yGaa	You should go to your doctor and ask about how he can help you with your acne.  I went to the doctor for a physical a while back and he mentioned it and he wrote me a prescription for some pills and a cream and they worked really well, really fast.  Otherwise I just use a random face wash in the shower... it's my personal belief that face washes do nothing unless you use a cream because all they do is dry out your skin, the cream is what helps because it stays on your skin for a long time.  |`|afmEbmKRaa	You should just try to keep your face clean with an anti-bacterial soap, other things might cause breakouts or irritation. I used to have horrible acne, tried everything but nothing worked. I finally just gave up and tried using regular soap like I said and it worked great. |`|fKYYw8Hnaa	<a href="http://www.exposedskincare.com/cgi-bin/category/landerv5?category=basica" rel="nofollow">http://www.exposedskincare.com/cgi-bin/c...</a>|`|1oUU20KEaa	I also had that problem, i tryed proactive, clean and clear, and lots of other junk! But what really worked for me was the brand OXY! They have spot treatment, bar of soaps, and body wash stuff! I hope it works for you! (it is quite pricey)<br>  good luck!|`|xuowtZLqaa	You might have to spend a bit of money and invest in something really good. I use products that are formulated in Switzerland and are 100% vegan. Go to arbonne.com and order their acne/problem skin regime. You won't regret it and it should not be allergic to it. I have sensitive skin issues too and it has been the only products I have found so far that help. All the best!
puUStDPpaa	oh my goodness I just used that , what a coincidence!<br>  Its the first time I used it though, Just bought it today.<br>  my skin is dry too, and so I just use a moisturizer with it. <br>  it smells amazing<br>  I would say after a couple days of using it twice a day you should see improvement. 
adL8Qm7yaa	its suppose to dry ur skin but not like to the point of skin peeling off.<br>  idk bout the grape fruit scent<br>  but neutrogena acne cleansers work exceptionally well.<br>  use it as much as u can, at least twice a day. once morning, once before sleeping|`|nyydk7ZHaa	yes it does i use the body wash and it cleared my acne up in like two days|`|9d5765a8ad11a156781607080dde1f62aa	i use the foaming grapefruit scrub once a day. any more would be too drying for me. i like it.

Nero e, in minor misura, rosso o il bianco sono i colori prevalentemente preferiti.<br>  <br>  Guanti e scarpe femminili, dal tacco molto alto, sono altri accessori fondamentali per l'estetica fetish. E lo stesso per gli stivali (anche in questo caso prevalentemente femminili), specie se fascianti l'intera gamba.<br>  Nn c'è una traduzione in italiano|`|SjpPVMWPaa	deriva dal vocabolo italiano FETICISTA<br>  XD|`|xbmxVmxzaa	Con il termine Fetish si intende lo spostamento della meta sessuale dalla persona viva nella sua interezza ad un suo sostituto, sia ciò che la sostituisce, una parte del corpo stesso, o una qualità, un indumento o qualsiasi altro oggetto.<br>  Fetish..................in Italiamo è feticista !!!<br>  In buona sostanza, quindi, il feticista è colui che prova attrazione sessuale per qualcosa che fuoriesce dai canoni della sessualità tradizionale.<br>  Il feticismo si differenzia dalla semplice preferenza dettata dai gusti personali, che tutti hanno, dal fatto che la presenza del feticcio diviene una condizione indispensabile per raggiungere l'orgasmo. In mancanza del feticcio, infatti, il feticista non riesce ad avere l'appagamento sessuale. Ed è proprio per questo motivo che il feticismo in sessuologia è ritenuto un disturbo, in quanto impedisce una libera vita sessuale rendendo il soggetto dipendente dall'oggetto o da qualisiasi altra cosa sia oggetto del suo feticismo.<br>  Il feticismo può manifestarsi in una persona in varie forme: in alcuni casi possono divenire feticcio un qualsiasi tipo umano, ogni caratteristica fisica e psichica, ogni parte del corpo, ogni secrezione corporea (sangue, sperma, feci, urina, sudore, ecc.), ogni indumento ed ogni oggetto. Anche i nei possono essere oggetto di feticismo, e quindi il partner adorerà, toccherà, bacerà, leccherà, annuserà i nei dell'altro, anche il solo vederli costituirà per lui motivo di eccitazione, ed anche il sentririsi toccare i propri lo ecciterà molto. Molti feticisti prediligono però solo nei in una determinatà parte del corpo come bocca, pancia, pube, volto, schiena ecc. Per altri feticisti, invece, vedere, sentire, annusare, inghiottire o palpare determinate cose è importante almeno quanto il coito nella sessualità ordinaria.<br>  Fra i più diffusi feticismi, vi sono il feticismo del piede maschile e il feticismo del piede femminile: in questo caso il feticista è attratto dai piedi e prova piacere non solo nel vederli, ma anche nel leccarli, baciarli, annusarli e nell'esserne masturbato. Relativi perlopiù al feticismo del piede maschile, specie nelle pratiche erotiche omosessuali, sono diffusi il trampling, consistente nel farsi calpestare dal partner, il tickling, ossia il farsi solleticare, lo sneaking, che comporta l' uso delle scarpe, il socking, con l'utilizzo dei calzini, e molte altre.<br>  |`|8Mg2cL2Kaa	sta scritto qui <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetish_(erotismo)" rel="nofollow">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetish_(ero...</a>

hqSWUc8uaa	There's a technique I saw at a hair show once called the rag technique... if you take a rag and tear it up into strips, and wrap your towel-dried hair around it, kinda spiral-y, then tie the ends loosely to hold it in place and let it dry like that, you can create a lot of bounce that way.<br>  <br>  Or get yourself some velcro rollers or hot rollers, although buying a bigger iron would probably be cheaper than the hot rollers...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|5d170f34e084450a407ece2a5f3d2b1baa	there are 2 options....get velcro rollers and put them all over and hit them with your hair dryer.

It's much easier than trying to style it every day and you can get your curls in a variety of sizes. Then you can just shower, scrunch and go. I have had perms on different occasions- they're fun. Just be sure to see a great stylist and use salon shampoo & products made especially for perms to maintain the health and longevity of your curls.
hqSWUc8uaa	It depends on why you want to dye it again... are you just talking regular maintenance once it grows out? Cuz that can be anywhere between 4-8 weeks, depending on how fast your hair grows... most people go about 6 weeks between colors. And when you do the roots, you should JUST do the roots... MAYBE if your color has faded, comb it through your ends the last 5-10 mins of processing time, but no more than that. You don't want to keep putting color on top of color, your hair will fry!<br>  <br>  Now, if you're talking you want to dye it again NOW because it's not what you wanted... well, you should probably wait at least a week or 2, and stop at a salon and have a stylist look at it and she/he can tell you what your best course of action will be.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!|`|EnXxuWuraa	I dyed mine, it looked like crap, I re-did it again an hour later.

Don't straighten it too much or it'll fall off! laugh out loud.|`|3lyFEzFVaa	well if you are only doing your roots you should go back whenever you have alot of new growth depending on how fast your hair grows. if you want all over color i would wait about three months to make your hair healthier again. if you did it at home it usually says on the box how long to wait. if you really would like to get it redone here are some tips on making it healthier so it is safe to dye sooner.<br>  <br>  1. put olive oil in your hair and cover with a shower cap. sleep with that in but make sure you have a shower cap or it will all get in your bed. put shampoo on before even getting your hair wet or it will be very hard to get out. then just wash as normal.<br>  <br>  2. [my favorite] mix two egg yolks with two tbsp of olive oil and a cup of water. put it all through your hair and leave it in for fiftenn minutes. it will be messy so its best to do it in the tub. after the fifteen minutes rinse out in luke warm water. watch out-if the waters too hot it will cook the egg! this will be hard to get out so your going to have to shampoo at least twice!<br>  <br>  3. when washing your hair leave your conditioner in a little bit longer than usual. maybe 5-10 minutes. its as simple as that! <br>  <br>  4. go into a salon and get a hot oil treatment done every once and awhile. they usually are not very expensive. just call different salons and ask their prices. it does wonders for the hair.<br>  <br>  don't forget to get the split ends trimmed! I would do it every 8 weeks or else your just cutting off your growth.|`|J5sxiD1Uaa	3-4 weeks|`|LO8p8tJdaa	about 6 weeks or just whenever there is alot of new growth in.|`|68g3ZKA4aa	Did you make a mistake and you want to know how long do you have to wait to re-dye it? If that's the case, it's normally a day or two. Wait two days and re-dye it. Re-dying it at the same day can cause hair damage. If your asking how long you have to wait till you re-dye your hair, the answer is wait till you feel like re-dying it. Probably couple of weeks to a month or even more. Till your natural hair root starts coming out. <br>  <br>  :)|`|XMnc2Dosaa	My best friend is a cosmotoligist(sp) and he does my hair. He tells me to wait 4 weeks, but i go every 2 months because i bleach my hair. If you bleach then wait 2 months so your hair doesn't get really damaged, but if not wait 4 weeks|`|jpycHuPNaa	usually until you can see the new roots growing in which is about a month or a month and a half. (You can always just do a touch up on your roots so your hair won't be damaged by the chemicals too much. )
hqSWUc8uaa	get a permanent... like... wave!!! or if your hair is too damaged to do that, keep braiding it... who cares if it looks stupid when you're at home, no one's gonna see it...<br>  <br>  Like, I hope that works for you...|`|LbvRxf2jaa	Yep a perm.  Get it done by a professional, not an at home kit though because you said your hair is damaged...|`|9ZbYSj3Daa	get a perm.|`|7xKfza0Aaa	you can use a curler but dotn leave it on for to long and when you take it off it will be light waves . or you can blow dry your hair like that after a shower.|`|FSkKAgZUaa	a perm. it would only last for about a year though.|`|LbTnDHDHaa	get a hair wave.|`|YqB5hVV6aa	its not permanent, but you could try a three-barreled curling iron.  i have one and it makes really pretty waves
hqSWUc8uaa	I don't know for certain, but most brand of attachments aren't interchangeable like that. A few are, but most aren't.<br>  <br>  I've never seen attachment combs longer than an inch for 99% of clippers or trimmers, but I'm sure if you call a beauty supply place like Sally's they can maybe tell you if they have them, and if they don't, that doesn't mean they can't order one for you. It's worth checking out.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!
hqSWUc8uaa	I have a couple favorites. Redken Extreme line is great for damaged hair. Also Matrix Biolage Fortifying (ForteTherapie) products are good, too! Also Paul Mitchell Super Strong, Back To Basics Vanilla Plum (which is fortifying), Bed Head Dumb Blonde (funny name, great products!)<br>  <br>  Use the shampoo and conditioner from any one of these product lines, and also invest in a good DEEP conditioner to use once a week. My favorites are Paul Mitchell Super Charged Moisturizer, Paul Mitchell Hair Repair, and Redken All Soft Heavy Cream conditioner/reconstructor.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|58ZnWeIFaa	Intense damage control by DOVE works really well. try it.
U39B6He4aa	According to a simple Wikipedia search, yes, alcohol usage can be detected by testing one's hair.|`|hqSWUc8uaa	You are the "retard", sorry to say, lol...<br>  <br>  ANYTHING you take into your body... ANYTHING... can be detected in your hair. Especially if your hair is long, cuz they can take a single hair strand, which if your hair is as long as mine is, would be at least 3 or 4 years old, they could tell any and all changes in diet, medication, whether or not I was a smoker at any time, when/if I got drunk at any time... etc... <br>  <br>  Hair is made up of cells just like the rest of your body... and your body's cells store all this information as well... so why wouldn't your hair?? ;)|`|roOGiwYeaa	i'm pretty sure you can't.
hqSWUc8uaa	They are not as good as salon quality but they are a little better than a regular discount store would sell... but not by much (at least for most of it)<br>  <br>  Call around to salons in your area and check the prices, you might find a good deal where you least expect it!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|64zSGVUAaa	They are the same thing.|`|wwgVpj0Daa	They sell both drugstore stuff and salon quality stuff.  You have to look around.  I think what you are talking about is the salon quality stuff, you have to mix it with developer.
mMkoTj7Kaa	Your really going to stress your hair doing these drastic things so closely you know.  Typically a treatment like you've described cost around $100-150.|`|AA10093245	They will have to strip your hair of the artificial color, take it lighter than the shade you want, then re-dye it the new shade and do the highlights. this will be very damaging to your hair, it's a lot of chemical processing. And it will be rather expensive too. Prepare to spend a minimum of $100, and at least a few hours of time.|`|hqSWUc8uaa	You can just stop in at a salon and have a stylist look at your hair, that way you can get a more accurate quote for how much it would cost to fix. <br>  <br>  Stop at a few different places... it doesn't hurt to get a 2nd or 3rd opinion, especially when you're considering dropping that much money to have your hair done.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8f5a3a5bc297fb829c196d7e5e38fe54aa	good question sry no answer lol
V7OR1QFAaa	not sure, but i guess its policy... plus, if my stylist had wacky hair, i wouldn't want it to turn out llike that, so i wouldn't get it done there!|`|GcWb7IRdaa	They all want them to look like the latest trends, to stay current, to make the custamers think "Maybe I can look like them if i go here"|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	becus u wudnt want to walk into a salon and have someone unnattractive "style" u|`|D5YIRxk4aa	Yes because they are representing the beauty industry besides if ur hair looks like crap why would they let you touch their hair!!!!!!!!!!|`|Ib7mI5L3aa	their makeing her die her hair BLONDE??<br>  o my gosh<br>  thats mean! what if she dosent want to?<br>  and says oh i dont want my hair that color cause it will probably look stupid on me<br>  and they say well you have to if you wanna work here!<br>  and then it turns out terrible!<br>  ughh<br>  that is just putting peer presure<br>  on to someone who just got their first job!!<br>  now how will she remember this FIRST JOB??<br>  that is so stupid that they would do somthing like this.<br>  you know what you should like go on strike!!<br>  haha<br>  lol j/k<br>  i dont know what to tell you..<br>  just go ask them y does she have to die her hair that color?<br>  why isnt she good enough now??<br>  do they think she is a slob??<br>  does she get a choice??<br>  what if she dosent want to and she wont get the job??<br>  what does she have to make everyone jealous when they come through that door??<br>  do they only hire blondes??<br>  or do they only hire pretty people??<br>  if they cant answer these questions right your freind should not work there<br>  work at like fantastic sams<br>  or somethin else <br>  DONT WORK AT GREAT CLIPS!<br>  THEY GAVE ME A BAD HAIRCUT THAT LASTED 2 YEARS<br>  FOR IT TO GROW BACK!<br>  FANTASTIC SAMS IS GOOD!<br>  THEY GOT A CURLER OUT OF MY HAIR WHEN IT WAS STUCK AND IT DIDNT COST ME ANYTHING!<br>  (if you really want to though you CAN go on strike)<br>  haha|`|hqSWUc8uaa	I have NEVER, in 13 years of doing hair and working at 4 different salons in that time, have I EVER been made/forced to look a certain way. Yes, there are expectations when you work at a salon, like your clothes should look nice and your hair and makeup should be done, but aside from that... they just want you to project the right image so  you don't scare the clientele, lol...<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you mean by your friend getting a "co-op" position... is that like, an apprentice or something? Because we have had apprentices in our salon and they have the same expectations as we (the licensed stylists) do. This is not normal if they are giving her (your friend) no choice in the matter... it's one thing to suggest maybe she do something different, but they shouldn't be able to force her. That could almost be considered discrimination, in my eyes... "do this or lose your job!" ...hmmmmm.....?!?<br>  <br>  As I said, it's one thing to make suggestions... like my manager, for instance... she's always "suggesting" that I get my hair cut (my hair is half-way down my back, and it's in good condition, so I think she's just jealous cuz she can't grow a head of hair like mine, lol) ;) I have had it short since I started at this salon 7 years ago, it's been various lengths and colors, but it was all MY choice when I did it, no one elses... to make someone's job depend on it is simply ridiculous!!! UNLESS someone looks frumpy, doesn't wear makeup or dress in nice clothes or whatever... like I said we have to sell an image to our clients...<br>  <br>  <br>  As for a job for a 16 year old.. the best thing to do is call around and ask or stop and pick up applications. I would see if maybe places need a part-time receptionist a couple nights a week or a couple Saturdays/Sundays.... if you're truly interested in learning to cut hair, the best thing to do is start surrounding yourself in the business now, cuz it will sure give you a head start when you attend cosmetology school!<br>  <br>  And what do I personally think of the average person? I try not to judge, especially if someone comes in to the salon in sweats or grubby clothes... it could be their day off, they could be doing laundry and have nothing else to wear... maybe it's just what they are comfy in! Cuz I know when it's MY day off, I don't always do my makeup or my hair, it's usually back in a ponytail... so you never know!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this answered your questions... good luck to you!|`|rPMrqjAvaa	Where ever your friend works is stupid, I am a hairstylist and I work in a salon. They DO NOT tell me how I can have my hair. If they did I wouldn't be working there. I think since we're in the beauty business that we are just more aware of the way we look. As for their makeup, they are probably using an expensive brand that lasts longer, like MAC, which is amazing by the way. Plus you have to remember we have had training in doing hair so we know how to do others and our own. <br>   I don't look at people differently, unless they have a mullet or something. Heck some days when I'm not at work my hair isn't done and I don't have any makeup on. <br>  As for the job for a 16 year old, I don't know. <br>  Tell your friend good luck with that place.|`|zvHndxQ4aa	As you know the doctor should be healthy to treat patients, Teachers should know everything to teach a student,<br>  so it goes on like that and the same principle applies here also if they are beauty then only will have some confidence that they will make us beauty its a simple concept
hqSWUc8uaa	I honestly wouldn't do a hot oil treatment, period. They're overrated.... don't really do anything more for you than to put vegetable oil on your hair or something (which I also don't recommend, lol)<br>  <br>  Just get yourself a deep conditioner, something that's a heavier moisturizer, like Paul Mitchell Super Charged Moisturizer or Paul Mitchell Hair Repair, or Nexxus Humectress... leave it on your hair for 5-10 mins and rinse out (shampoo first, then the cond.)<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|EVmmVsPnaa	You're supposed to wash your hair after a hot oil treatment.|`|fv0DEqQmaa	BEFORE|`|y58LCniDaa	The instructions for hot oil treatment usually says to wash and shampoo after the treatment.
hqSWUc8uaa	Don't use Selsun Blue OR Head & Shoulders. Both can actually contribute to the problem of flaking!!! Use Redken Solve Shampoo... best stuff out there for dandruff (if it IS dandruff that you truly have... most of the time dry skin/scalp is confused with dandruff... try using Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo & Conditioner first, then if it doesn't help you then use the Redken Solve, followed by Redken Clear Moisture Conditioner)<br>  <br>  Good luck!
hqSWUc8uaa	I agree with az... and check out lots of other big name sites too... paul mitchell, graham webb, redken, matrix... I'm sure they all have similar set-ups for students and/or stylists.<br>  <br>  Good luck! <br>  <br>  (and welcome to the field!!!) :)|`|G61RoRPaaa	if you go to the professional redken website, you can register as a cos student and they have foil techniques
AA10019712	Yes, henna tattoos are temporary and they last a few days (they will fade gradually).  They are applied with a paste made of the henna plant.  An artist will apply with a paint cone or brush and then you leave it on for a while or overnight (the longer you leave it on, the longer it will last) and when you wash it off, your skin will be temporarily dyed a dark red or close to black color.  They technically shouldn't be called tattoos because tattoos are permanent and go underneath the skin, whereas henna is just temporarily dying the surface of your skin.  If you don't go with an artist you can also buy do-it-yourself kits that come with stencils, but I haven't tried those.  If you want to look it up online without getting a lot of ads or junk try using the word "mehndi" which is what we call it in India.|`|O5zXOJaqaa	henna is ink.. its like brown.. it actyally kinda looks like dirt when its on the skin.  it can be really pretty, though, too... it lasts about 4-6 weeks .. they are applied wtih a stencil.. its like spray painting on your skin kinda. it doesnt hurt|`|2dd6d2e0681ada1512910b57f1bc3305aa	Everyone's said what Henna is so I'm just going to say this:<br>  <br>  It depends on the individual how long it lasts.  Some take the paste better than others.  For example, my daughter gets a henna tattoo at the same time I do.  Hers last about 4 weeks, mine lasts 6 months.  Why?  I have no idea.  It could be because her skin is lighter than mine or I have a different chemistry than she and it absorbs the ink more/better.  (I was also the one that had the stupid Ash Wednesday mark for a month...so needless to say I don't do THAT anymore)<br>  <br>  As for how it's applied?  Usually they put it in a baggie with a corner cut and squirt the paste onto your skin, ie. like icing a cake.|`|O9hMhBSaaa	Henna is a natual powder, that gets mixed with water to make a paste. It starts out dark green when you apply it. It can be applied with special pens or a plastic bag. You have to  stay perfectly still and let the design completely dry for 6 to 8 hrs, then you wash off the paste. it leaves a light design that slowly darkens over an hr. it ends up a dark red color. depending on the strength of the henna they can last a week to a month. I love henna tattoos, they are really pretty in the summer and because thay dont last you can keep changing them up. I get them all summer long and have my own henna kit. they take a while to dry and you have to really be careful not to smudge them when there drying, but besides that they are awesome!|`|Yccvy0eZaa	Henna is tempory and very tradtional in indian weddings i had both on my hands and feet and it last for about 8 days the old saying behind this is that the longer it last/takes to come off the stronger the bond between you and your husband is.Its reddish/brown and smells like spices and looks like dirt, when its dry its pale in colour, cracks up and fall off then you wash the area and the colour becomes brighter. :-)|`|ZHiGo3dZaa	Henna paste can be applied using a bottle iwth a fine tip or a cone, like a cake decorating  tool but with a tiny opening.<br>  Henna will last  1-2 weeks and then as the skin  naturally sloughs off the design fades away.<br>  They are safe, natural and temporary, if you use 100% natural henna.<br>  STay away from anything black as it may be dangerous for you and cause blistering and scarring and life long health issues. Here are some photos and how to do it. <a href="http://www.hennacaravan.com/how/how.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hennacaravan.com/how/how.html</a><br>  Henna is fun and easy|`|uNd8ZqZMaa	Yes they are temporary. It's ink that either start's off black or brown and fades away to a light brown maybe redish tone. Depends on quality of the ink. It's just a fun way of getting a tattoo without the real neddle deal. Try it out! Can last to 6weeks of course depending on quality. Other than that a little over a week or so. Washes off little by little with showers and water exposure.
IxLj8bBZaa	It's tied in to evolution.  As humans evolved from other forms of mammal, we gradually lost our ability to grow fur on all our limbs.  Some have lost this ability more than others--look at how the average Asian person grows less body hair than those of other races.  You can see how one's level of hair growth is genetically determined, with the usually mutations are part of ongoing evolution.<br>  <br>  Now, why did humans "lose" the ability to grow fur on their limbs, yet "gain" the ability to grow long hair on their scalps?  Again, there must be an evolutionary reason.  <br>  <br>  But, unlike fur, your hair falls out and grows back in cycles, according to the article below!<br>  <br>  Check out the link below and see what you think!|`|LpP4Rmt4aa	your hair grows only a certain length just to coat your body and protect it (cold/heat and other stuff) it stop bc it just does..it doesnt grow like hair on your head. now thats a whole different story...|`|6748007ac489c14a5dc03512115d7983aa	They serve different purposes. Leg hair is only meant as a mild protection from skin irritants abbrasions etc. <br>  The hair on your head is to help keep your noodle warm. The majority of your body heat escapes through your head. <br>  Your body knows the difference because it's smart. It's called cell differentiation.|`|MYrI01ZGaa	Its a different type of hair follicle. Every hair has a certain length at which it stops growing, some people can't grow the hair on their heads past their shoulders and others will just keep growing. Also, most body hair, especially legs have two different cycles. Thats why it grows in so quickly, because there is a second helping of hair behind it. And your body doesn't "know" anything, besides how continously grow hair, it doesn't have anything to do with you shaving.|`|hqSWUc8uaa	There are different types of hair on your body. Leg hair is made up differently than the hair on your head, and different still from the soft, downy hair that is on almost every inch of your body. The chemical makeup of the hair on your head is different, it is "pre-programmed" to keep growing, whereas the hair on our legs, underarms, etc, is pre-programmed to do the opposite. Different chemical and biological makeup is all... it's all part of the genetics that makes us human beings (it's what makes us NOT look like apes, lol)<br>  <br>  In addition, the hair on your body (all of the types of hair) all grow in the same 3 stages. First is the growth stage, which is obviously when your hair grows in, and this stage can be anywhere from a month to 2 years, depending on which hair we are talking about (longer for the hair on your head, probably much shorter for the rest of your body hair). Second is the sleep stage, or dormant stage. Your hair WILL grow during this stage, it's just INCREDIBLY slow. This is the longest stage, lasting anywhere from a couple months to 5 years or longer, again depending on which hair we're talking about. The last stage is when your hair root releases the hair follicle (which is why we lose 50-100 hair strands a day) and the process starts all over again. Obviously each hair strand is in a different stage or we'd be completely bald from head to toe every 2-7 years, lol... once again, something your body just knows to do due to our genetic makeup as human beings.<br>  <br>  The mysteries of the human body... amazing, eh?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|j5rvKxGOaa	I am not an expert but this is my educated guess: The hair on your legs is made to grow to a certain length, its the cells that tell it to grow, how long to grow. Like every cell has a job to do and the cell for your leg hair only allows it to grow so long. The cells for your leg hair are different from the ones on your head. The ones on your head are told to do something completely different.  They grow back after you shave because there is still a hair follicle under your skin to tell it to grow. I think the hair follicle/cell can just tell if your hair is shorter somehow.
85ztWjNtaa	it doesnt matter about the colour of the dye <br>  it depends how many times you dye it and your natual hair colour<br>  and im sick of people trying to pull her hair off.<br>  she has the mc donalds colour in her hair.<br>  ffs<br>  it goes wrong and it fades to a disgusting orange colour as well.|`|c8a3e9dfb09ecbc5989dbc8cc405f056aa	the color I know that is closest to it is Radiant ruby from herbal essences.
EBle5hZEaa	My gay friend uses brycreem. He says when the guys touch it they all say "Ooohh... it's so soft". To answer your question, yes...

M725dpU6aa	Hair grows half an inch per month, if that helps any. Just measure the distance in inches between where it is now and where you want it to be, then multiply that number by two and you should get a good estimate of how long it will take in months.|`|hztGUgN1aa	On an average, hair grows at the rate of half to an inch a month .

Short hair should not cost $90 to perm.|`|hqSWUc8uaa	Yes, this will work, but just have someone help you with it, so you don't get solution in your eyes. I'd recommend getting a perm at Sally's though over the department store brands, they can recommend one that is suited to your hairtype<br>  <br>  You will have to do this probably every 2-3 months, though, cuz obviously as new hair grows it will need to be straightened as well.<br>  <br>  My salon charges only $45 for straightening with perm solution. Check around... you could get it done professionally for cheaper.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
EUplzZ31aa	If you read on the box, they probably won't reccomend dying it from your previous colour to the one you wanted.<br>  It's important that it's reccomended.<br>  But yes, take it to the salon before you really mess it up.<br>  You could end up thinning your hair or going green or orange.|`|EWDBjGwTaa	did u dye ur hair blonde first?as in bleach it?if so use a darker colour...try sticking to a natural one tho,like natural brown 4 example..use 10 vol peroxide as ur hair is blonde and u only need to deposit colour into ur hair.using a stronger peroxide will lift ur colour more which u dont need. if ur naturally blonde id need more info|`|dDdkYpDzaa	Totally go to a salon - once I had a really bad hair dye experience and some of my hair fell out before I finally had if fixed properly - they did a great job and it was well worth the money!|`|hqSWUc8uaa	PLEASE go to a salon before you mess it up any further, if nothing else at least for a consult, they can better let you know what your best course of action will be. <br>  <br>  You probably still have blonde spots cuz you didn't have enough dye to cover all of your hair properly, and the mucky spots are prossibly because you covered it with a shower cap. If the directions don't say anything about covering your head to process, there's a reason for it!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2E6uSwNcaa	lol it's funny when people answer hair questions and they tell you to go the salon when we all know that's not what you're gonna do.. and it doesn't even answer your question. (it's just that i've asked some hair questions and have gotten the salon suggestion and it's annoying). --- however if you do have money for the salon and wouldn't mind going.. then yeah..<br>  <br>  but anyways, i agree with the second person with getting help from someone else to help you dye your hair. and i also think you should use a darker color (because the color is going to fade a little lighter anyways since you bleached your hair) to try and even out those spots.. and when you do, try dying the light colors first then the rest.|`|7b8f940f939aa1253fbae8cd0acb5a8daa	You can only mess this up more.  Walk into a salon, tell them you screwed up a hair dye at home and you need to fix it.  This will probably cost more than a regular hair dye since you will probably go through a restore and then a dye.  <br>  <br>  This is a lot like hiring cheap unskilled workers for a construction job, they screw it up and you pay more to fix it than if you hired the right people the first time.|`|8R4O56LCaa	if you really want the color try again. you cant go back to blonde inlelss u bleach it.<br>  good luck|`|onE19jwKaa	I do it all the time and it looks at bit....yeah not nice.

hqSWUc8uaa	You could use a toner (which you can get done at a salon or purchase probably at Sally's... a platinum toner, something with a violet base, they can help you choose)<br>  <br>  OR....<br>  <br>  Something that's a lot less damaging to your hair would be using what used to be known as a "Bluing" Shampoo. "So Silver" by Matrix Essentials is a good one. Cost Cutters also has one that's called "Silver Shine" (I work for a CC, so I have to promote, lol) There are lots others out there I'm sure, but these are the 2 I'm familiar with. This shampoo is actually violet in color (which is strange that it used to be referred to as "bluing" when it's really more purple than blue, lol... but I digress...) Washing with this kind of shampoo will neutralize/tone those yellow parts without the damage caused by doing another color process on your hair. Yes, toner is used with a lower volume of peroxide, but any volume of peroxide can do damage, especially over hair that's previously dyed or bleached. Then after washing just follow up with your regular conditioner (make sure you are using a color-safe shampoo/conditioner for proper care of your hair color)<br>  <br>  Start out by using this shampoo, as I said, once or twice a week, but you can use it more if that doesn't do the trick. It may take a couple times using it before you see a definite difference, but it WILL help!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you! :)|`|2E6uSwNcaa	The only place you will find them at is in any beauty supply store such as SALLY'S or most hair salons.|`|kbAhk17Xaa	Sallys beauty supply|`|GhkzBPJvaa	firstly if you have bleached areas of your hair to white that is a HUGE no, no! bleaching hair to white is a recipe for disaster, pale yellow is the furthest that anybody should ever bleach their hair to: <a href="http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/8565/shadescu1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/8565/...</a> platinum / white hair is achieved via bleaching to the pale yellow stage and then using a violet based toner. i am surprised that the white strands are not snapping off! all you can do now is to baby your hair and treat it kindly. use a temporary toner that doesn't contain ammonia or peroxide like Born blonde: <a href="http://www.alltoiletries.com/shared/categories.asp?id=1245&title=Clairol+Born+Blonde" rel="nofollow">http://www.alltoiletries.com/shared/cate...</a> once the toners start to wash out then use products that are designed to counteract yellow tones like Goldwell: <a href="http://www.goldwellusa.com/products/haircare/colorglow-liveblonde.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.goldwellusa.com/products/hair...</a> and learn from your mistakes.|`|PZnx7ZLXaa	go to salon services they sell tonors and will give you advice. this is where the hairdressers purshase theres, so it will be cheeper for you. good luck|`|ZCXWByA2aa	purple shampoo works great to tone down the brassy tones bleach leaves<br>  <br>  they sell it at sallys|`|eyyk21MUaa	a salon....thats the only toner i would trust!
hqSWUc8uaa	I think they are both cute, but I like the 2nd one, I think that one suits you well :) <br>  <br>  I don't know where you live, but I would think you can get your hair done for $80 or less. My salon charges $24.95 starting for an updo (it goes up depending on how long it takes... that's only for a half-hour... and an hour and a half is like $60-ish) I live in WI, so...<br>  <br>  Wash your hair tonight (hair styles better the 2nd day) and put in any styling products you would normally use (mousse or gel) and wear a button-down shirt so that you don't have to pull a tshirt or whatever over your style!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!|`|lYZ71zYAaa	The second one will work for your type of hair, it is naturally curly isn't?|`|dggXDSpwaa	i really think the second one is totally hot!

E1sqGzmtaa	No its not. It can be sexy.|`|81XeRTlmaa	No it doesn't bother me.  But if you're selfconcious then you could try just shaving your whole head.  Don't shave your head but have a beard though; that I find odd.|`|lFenXNCzaa	Nope and if so, then they are shallow and not worth pursuing. |`|hT0N20QRaa	I bet it's not if you shave your head...<br>  <br>  I think the problem is that men look really pathetic when they try to keep as much of it as possible... so they're not just bald, they're also showing evidence that baldness has made them it's b*tch.<br>  <br>  and THAT is the part that's not attractive... <br>  <br>  I have some serious thinning out in my near future, and when it happens, I'm going Patrick Stewart on it's azz... embrace the baldness with gusto and the girls can take it or leave it.  It's the whimping out that guarantees they'll leave it.|`|Ue5NoJOgaa	I can't speak for women, but my brother and I look really really similar and have very similar personalities, when we both started to bald I used propecia and he didn't and I do way better with women than him...we are sort of a mini experiment LOL|`|mhDmfiPDaa	Not really, in my opinion.
lvBUl3Zdaa	What will make the hair color show up brighter is not leaving the color in longer, but lifting your own hair to a lighter color before you start. One-step products like this can lift only one shade. If you want the color to really show up, you will need a two-step product, where you use a separate bleach and toner. Ask the people at Sally's what they recommend for the effect you are trying to achieve.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	I have naturally dark hair.  I used ION8 and it came out with deep pink highlights,( sort of like an eggplant color).   Be careful what you use!  Burgundy has a lot red that turns pink.   Try using ION 3R  305500 Dark Red Brown. Depending on how good your hair takes color, no more than 20 minutes.  Good Luck!|`|IVjspiStaa	follow directions exactly...leaving it on longer will only irritate your head and make you bald. <br>  get the right color you want to end up with...|`|kHa6NmWBaa	To make your hair brighter mix the color with double the developer.  In other words, if the color calls for 2 oz of color to 2 oz of developer, use 2 oz of color and 4 oz of developer.  This will save you from having to do a double process as mentioned in another answer.  It is also much easier on your hair than a double process.<br>  <br>  By the way, the color that you are using is one of the color lines I use in my Salon.  It is great for vibrant colors.|`|V1QpnziHaa	it depends on your hair color now. if you have dark hair then just go with what the box says about 25 minutes. if you have blonde hair then leave in in for 10 minutes longer than the directed time.<br>  <br>  i went from dark ash blonde to burgundy in one color and only left it in for 25 it ended up leaving my hair spotty and not natural looking. i had to redo it again and still it did not take to my hair completly. within 5 weeks it looked like i had blonde highlights. and the red faded out except for around my roots. it was not what i had pictured.<br>  <br>  good luck though.|`|Tmn0y0XNaa	what color is ur hair now? because i tried the same color and i was just doin highlights and it turned out like grape pop purple lol.. and i had to get it done professionally which is what i always do anyway and also burgandy fades fast out of all the colors too.. but to let u kno how long to leave it on id hafta know ur natual hair color|`|xIShQKTfaa	It is a Professional product and with that the directions should give you the best time. Stay away from cool spots in your house or fans. Do not go much over the manufactures reccommended time.|`|ixo4nHsOaa	most dyes you leave in for about 40 minutes u can leave it on longer but i would only leave an extra 5 or so becuase you dont want it to go to bright and you get the wrong colour|`|MHdi87H7aa	Well it all depends on your hair color right now<br>  <br>  but usually i leave the hair color in my hair 15 more minutes then what it usually says because i have dark hair|`|g02RY9Hwaa	I think you should only leave it in no longer than 5 minutes over...it can really mess up your hair if you leave it in too long.

YsAEPYwOaa	IMO both are really good options, however the blue would be more practical especially for the spring and summer months because than you could wear it with white, over-dyed black, and medium blue jeans depending on what colors you want to go with top and shoe wise.

az0Z0DIjaa	You bet it can make your acne worse! If you scrub to hard, you will aggravate your acne. If you dry your skin out too much....your skin will overproduce oil to compensate= more acne. So be gentle with your skin, don't scrub to hard, and be sure to use moisturizer!|`|hX1Qfs3qaa	Yeah. All you need to use on your face is face wash and moisturizer. Why are you using so much product? Leave your face alone.|`|WQb5154Qaa	YES! You need gentle products for your face. Try to watch this tutorial on skin care and if you follow her suggestions your skin will be awesome. I love all of her videos, she is awesome.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPv_POaTTZ8&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPv_POaTT...</a>|`|KiqjuCVvaa	Yes it can when its very dry your skin makes more oil which causez more acne
VDOkmBiBaa	yup|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Yes. Absolutely yes.<br>  <br>  Stop using so many products. Try one "system" with products designed to work together and stick with it. It takes a few weeks to clear up and repair the damage. Don't forget to moisturize. A lot.<br>  <br>  Don't always choose the highest strength of something that you can find- sometimes they can "burn" sensitive skin...which only irritates it more! It can't heal the injury AND fight the bacteria AND clear the debris out of the pores at the same time!<br>  <br>  Lay off some of the stuff. Relax a bit. Take it easy on your skin and it will begin to clear up.|`|Y2yiyVuSaa	It sounds as though you have very sensitive skin on your face. I would suggest you see a dermitologist to get the exact treatment you need. Acne is an infection, and inflammation (caused by irritation), can intensify your condition.
J9Rgy02baa	For the aftercare, they will most likely give you a paper with instructions for that. But if not, or if it's unclear then you need to rub aquaphor on your tattoo every day. <br>  When you first get it, they will probably wrap it in plastic wrap. Leave that on for a few hours and then when you take it off, wash the tattoo in hot water and use UNSCENTED ANTIBACTERIAL soap!! (it will sting a little bit, but it won't hurt the tattoo at all) Don't scrub it with a washcloth or anything, just use your fingers to wash it. Then blot dry it with a paper towel. Then you need to rub aquaphor over it. Not too much, don't pile it on, but use it as if it's lotion. <br>  Aquaphor feels like vaseline, but is not petroleum based! That's important. Do not use things like tattoo goo or vaseline... aquaphor works the best. You can buy it at any drug store. <br>  The first day, keep it wrapped if you are going to have anything touching it like a long sleeved shirt or a jacket. Don't wear bracelets for a while. <br>  Wash your tattoo with this method for the first 3 days, at least twice a day. And apply the aquaphor every time it rubs off and avoid touching your new tattoo.<br>  After 3 days, you can switch to an unscented lotion for sensitive skin. I suggest using lubriderm for extra dry skin, it is very moisturizing and is good for the sensitivity. <br>  Your tattoo will scab, don't pick at it! If you follow these directions, the scab will be minimal, mine hardly scabbed at all.<br>  Color will come out in your scab, but don't worry, your tattoo will be fine that's normal. Just don't pick at it or scratch it. If it becomes dry and flaky, use some more aquaphor or lotion. (The aquaphor won't hurt it if you use too often!) <br>  If it starts looking a little pale, rub some lotion on it and the color becomes vibrant again if you're getting color. <br>  Since it's on your wrist, I'm guessing you don't shave it, but you never know i'll just throw this in here. Don't shave over your tattoo until it's completely healed! you can tell this by closing your eyes and running your finger over the tattoo. If you feel it raised or bumpy at all don't shave!<br>  <br>  Also, with the alcohol.You can't drink beforehand, they won't tattoo you if you have alcohol in your system. I know it sucks, but it can have adverse affects because sometimes when you get a tattoo, the adrenaline starts running through your body and that can have bad effects when mixed with the alcohol or any other drug. Take some tylenol beforehand, it won't numb your wrist but it won't be so bad.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|sfEE6hkGaa	Drink all you want afterwards, it shouldn't bleed after its done.  <br>  <br>  As for aftercare, wash it with Dove Unscented for Sensitive Skin 3 times a day for the first couple days and apply olive oil to it to keep it moist.  Yes, regular old olive oil that you'd use for cooking.  Don't bandage it and if you're just sitting around, pull your clothes off of it and let it hang out so it doesn't get irritated.  <br>  <br>  After it starts to heal it, switch to unscented lotion.  I like Aveeno Baby.  If its not ready, it'll probably sting if you put the lotion on it.<br>  <br>  Olive oil is the best thing I've found to use on my tattoos.  It doesn't sting, its natural, its cheap and its not heavy so the tattoo can breath.|`|pG9cufuHaa	I have some tattoos so, just make sure to wash it with anti-bacterial soap after you get it, you must leave the bandage on for at least an hour, it will keep it from getting infected.. After that, for care, they will probably have something called "h2ocean" now if they have that, or you can get it, do so.. It is the best stuff you can get to my knowledge, and it will keep it from getting infected and keep it from drying out to much.. worked so good that mine didn't really even peel (while going through the healing process it may peel a little bit, just don't pick at it or scratch it!" As far as alcholol I wouldn't see why not, if you want to be safe give it like an hour, and make sure for at least 2 weeks you don't submerge it in water, and avoid pools or a jacuzzi for those 2 weeks to (lets it heal properly.) I hope this helps, and remember get "h2ocean" for the after care.|`|YUkzmz1daa	Yes you can drink after the tattoo, it is just not good to drink before or while you are getting the tattoo because of the thinning of the blood. I have always used unscented Lubraderm (I don't know how to spell it). It does not leave that greasy ointment feeling. It has worked well for me.|`|VCRAsRQPaa	Drinking should be fine.  As far as an ointment the people at the tattoo shop should suggest something called "tattoo goo" or something comparable.  You put that on your tattoo a few times a day for a few days and you should be fine.|`|0Ji5L32gaa	if they dont give you anything when you get it pierced, rub a little vaseline into it once or twice a day<br>  <br>  trust me it works wonders|`|HHyny0JSaa	Leave it covered for acouple of hours after, then let it get some air. Wash it a couple of times a day with an antibacterial soap, make sure not to scrub - even when your skin starts to peel and flake. After you wash it use a thin coat of ointment - A&D works great- on it a few times a day. The most important thing is to not let it get super dry while it is healing. After about a week you can switch to a lotion like Lubriderm sensitive skin (nothing with perfume or dyes) and put a thin coat over your tat whenever it feels dry. Sure you can drink after. Just dont before cause it thins your blood so you will bleed more when you are getting it.|`|HUrYSp4oaa	they will advise u what to put on it.  dont worry about drinking as the tattoo only bleeds when its first done just be sure to cover it so u dont knock it or anything.   preparation H (the pile cream) is usually recommended for tattoo healing as it has shark oil and that seems to be good for it. u can buy it in boots superdrug, supermarkets or any chemist.|`|CYyjz4Mlaa	make sure the tattooist is clean, clean and extra clean i got a bad infection from a mate who was just starting up. always keep it extra dry and clean, try and keep it out of water until the scab is gone (don't go swimming) if your taking a shower put Vaseline on it to keep the water out as it will fade other wise. Most of all don't pick it! it wil turn out awful and faded. most tattooist sell expensive products but the best thing you can get is Vaseline, sudocream and slap it if its itchy.<br>  good luck and don't worry its not that painful.|`|br1FB5rraa	Drinking after the tattoo will be fine, just not before or else it'll hurt worse, and the color will fade. As for after care, use a+d ointment for 6 days, then switch to using curel ultra healing, unscented lotion for another week or two, until the peeling is done. Also don't soak it in water for 40 days, and DON'T itch or pick at it while its healing|`|hZcqEmbAaa	Dont drink the night before you get it done, or you will bleed alot! i made that mistake!<br>  <br>  It will be covered up after, leave the dressing on for about 2-3 hours. When you remove it have a warm bath and let it soak. Then apply Bepanthen cream (i know its for baby's butts!!) 1-2 a day until it heals.<br>  <br>  And dont pick it when it starts to scab, you'll ruin it!|`|URZeQfQCaa	you need to use that **** cream, works great at lowering inflammation, keepin the scab soft and speeds up healing
XqzPkogaaa	It used to be a big thing but not anymore.<br>  I see lots of people these days with different hair color and different eyebrow colors.<br>  I dont think anyone really notices it anymore because its considered very retro and if the colors are very similar like brown and black it looks fine.<br>  No need to worry no one notices anymore x]|`|HVc8kBcvaa	naw.  there's so many people who color their hair and they're eyebrows don't match.  I never notice unless someone who was really blonde goes black and they have super light eyebrows.  There's always eyebrow pencils/wax/powder to fill them in or eyebrow dye that you can get done at salons.|`|CQUuCpTQaa	I've never really paid attention, but now that you've said it i'll probably be staring at random people on my way home today :)|`|4dIWZCLGaa	People seem to notice when eyebrows are darker than your haircolor, but not lighter. If you feel that way you can always get an eyebrow pencil and darken it a little.
HVc8kBcvaa	You might see that a couple times but if you used permanent color it should be permanent.  Some of the color rinses off the outer hair shaft but don't worry the majority is still there!  If you see a noticeable difference, L'oreal professionals and Aveda are a couple of brands that carry color-enhancing shampoos and conditioners.  They'll deposit a little bit of color each time you use them.|`|XSIvL60maa	I totally identify with you. I have extreamly dye resistant hair and have to leave the dye on longer than it says to but a product i recently found that stops the colour out when you wash it is dry shampoo and conditioner (<a href="http://www.chemistdirect.co.uk/batiste-shampoo_v_740.html)." rel="nofollow">http://www.chemistdirect.co.uk/batiste-s...</a> I use this for a few days before i was my hair too keep the colour in longer. Also the dye may be washing off your scalp not your hair. If you use alot of conditioner when you wash it like i do i would also reccomend getting "nice and easys" colour protect conditioner than comes with nice and easy hair dye, you can buy this seperatly. I have always used aussie shampoo for coloured hair so i dont notice any difference :). Failing all else, buy cheapo hair dye (you can get it for ￡2.50 in superdrug) and dye it all the time...|`|SPq3zNBgaa	Well, not much can be done, the color will wash out sooner or later, BUT<br>  you can start with a shampoo and conditioner for your hair color<br>  (black), they might help you. <br>  Also, between dyes you could use a semi-permanent dye like Casting. It's going to bring your hair shine and give you time between dyes.|`|4oqWsFA0aa	The shampoo isn't what matters. its the water temperature. If you wash your hair in cooler water the color won't fade and it won't come out as muchh. What the cold water does is close your pours in your hair. Hope this helped =]|`|DEacde81aa	The first few times you wash it, it will look like its falling off.<br>  Especially black, i was terrified when I saw it all in the shower. xD<br>  But it only happens a maximum of 4 washes.<br>  <br>  But you can buy special shampoos for a certain colour, it will help alot.<br>  I don't know any brands in particular, sorry!|`|PwxmrBm9aa	Was it a permanent colour, if not it's probably best to use one if you want to colour to stay.<br>  Washing your hair with hot water can fade the colour, also unhealthy & dry hair won't keep the colour for as long.<br>  Use a shampoo that is sulfate free and a conditioner specically for your hair type and with lots of natural extracts.

9jSmmIxfaa	Ok this really works I have done it before. In fact it was my hair dresser that suggested it.<br>  For Dark Brown hair... Make a STRONG pot of coffee and let it cool. then get a large bowl dump the coffee in there and soak your hair. Your hair will eventually soak up the color.<br>  Im not going to give you a time frame because I dont know exactly what color your hair is now (but you will be able to see when your hair is darker) Not only will it dye your hair darker, The caffene gives the shine a great boost..<br>  <br>  Also try soaking hair in Kool-Aid for Red hair..<br>  And lemon juice and Sunshine for Lighter hair!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!! =)<br>  <br>  EDIT- Tea bags will NOT work to get DARK hair use the coffee!|`|5mWZrA97aa	try?a?wig|`|MrizzMDhaa	Don't do it - it will look horrid and flat and obviously home made.

For Coach, you can just go to coach.com. <br>  <br>  Chanel and LV bags are good investment. They last a long time. I have them. You can use them over and over again. They just get better and better everyday. They never go out of style too. They are classic too.|`|tNMi9q5Waa	Nordstrom|`|0OQQj23caa	i  recommend <a href="http://www.nikesea.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nikesea.com</a> i am store owner in LA, i buy some lv bags,gucci bags,sunglasses, jeans from them every week, and we work well with the orders, i love their products and service, That is why i recommend them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nikesea.com/handbag-c-275.html?osCsid=rdj8gieau427a69n8h18au5423" rel="nofollow">http://www.nikesea.com/handbag-c-275.htm...</a>|`|Y5a3n1E6aa	Google the brand names of the purses you want.  It will take you to their official website and use the store locator on the websites to find a store near you.<br>  <br>  If you want to go for something cheaper, sometimes craigslist.com has some good ones where people post it up for sale.|`|L2tQ7t6Faa	You can learn where to buy with ebay-cash.  Buying on ebay isn't the safest because some designer bags are knock-offs. But ebay-cash will definitely point you in the right direction|`|Ppev4EAJaa	saks fifth
iMrrBafPaa	I always see my boss(male) wear it under the sleeve. People can't really see it when u r walking. But when u r at ur computer working or giving a presentation, it'll shine. I always think it looks very classy.|`|4o9CxQOLaa	I personally wear my watch underneath my sleeve. However, it's down to comfort really. If you find it more comfortable with it over the sleeve, then do that. If not, then wear it under.

More and more parents are opting for their kids to grow their hair out medium length-long naturally, with some occasional trimming here and there|`|wb9BBKzRaa	I think faux hawks are adorable on little boys<br>  <br>  <a href="http://red.blogs.aol.com/dyn/userimages/0000000000/000000000/00000000/0000000/000000/90000/5000/700/95743/250347.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://red.blogs.aol.com/dyn/userimages/...</a>
jg72L7K6aa	Hi ummmm I like the second picture the best ohh and ummm uhhhh<br>  You look pretty with the what ever color that is in the  second picture!<br>  I would suggest you a vouumizing conditioner with matcher shampoo,<br>  A short over the shoulder cut with side bangs and layers !!<br>  I think it will suit you very much !<br>  Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease pick me for best answer ooo and plus you should try some eyeliner and some kinda smokey dark eye for when your husband comes home !<br>  OOOOOOO........And try some  mascara and eyebrow filler cause your eye are too beautiful !|`|a79b376f814b9b52daa5b96365dcd2caaa	You need to have it cut into a shorter style, not too short .  I am sure the hairdresser will find a style that SUITS you, not fits you.  You could DYE you hair an Auburn color.  I am sure it would look nice.<br>  <br>  However, and not wishing to be rude.   In your position I would concentrate more on eating healthy, exercising and losing about 80 pounds in weight.  extra weight, apart from the unhealthy aspect, makes you look older.  Just keeping it real honey.  Good luck.|`|eWCMPZL2aa	hmm..layers and side bangs or maybe like sholder length and get a perm? lmao. you look good with dark hair too so if it's blonde, you should thing about dying it dark brown or something.|`|kAs5o8XDaa	Your hair looks pretty in the third picture! I think long hair fits you best, and that blonde haircolor in the third pic looks good. <br>  You are pretty the way you are, don't let those who tell you to loose weight bother you. They are just manipulated by what society/media tells them. <br>  :P|`|9jSmmIxfaa	I really like it the dark brown color. It makes your face look very pretty. I would cut a few inches off not too much tho. And put some curls on the ends would look amazing!!|`|gXFhAPMEaa	I would have it cut shorter with layers and some side bangs.<br>  <br>  Have Fun With Faith|`|10NCie9uaa	loose some weight and you'll look HOT
duiuPZ9Jaa	Are you talking about the water line? If so, I'd suggest white eyeliner...Rimmel or GOSH...Because darker colours in the water line of the eye just makes eyes alot smaller.<br>  <br>  But yeah...GOSH I think is best...|`|VsLSJ65Paa	inside your eye? <br>  I hope you just are talking about eye liners. haha<br>  I use MAC and calvin klien :]|`|5apGkgS9aa	rimmel kohl cheap but good..|`|39X8e50Raa	well  i love   urban decay  24/7  eyeliner  in zero it is an amazing eyeliner  is is really creamy so you can blend it easily but it also drys really quick so it stays on your eyes all day and its waterproof <br>  <br>  or you could try the mac power point i havent tried this one yet but apparently its known for  its staying ability apparently it just wont budge or smudge  so i  suggest you try one of them|`|05daceaaa082bb305c111d460191a776aa	Maybelline and Revlon.. The best :) Use the ones that automatically roll out, so you don't need to sharpen them|`|AA12332075	utla brand eyeliner is by far the best i have used, and it doesnt wear off easily!|`|6CNhhTsDaa	oh my gosh you want to colour your eye!?!?!?! O_______o|`|3KpyXDmlaa	MAC eye kohl works really well if you're talking about lining the inner side of your lids. Even though it wears off somewhat faster than eye pencil, it goes on much easier, and can be put on to look subtle or very bold, depending on your personal taste, which is something I had a lot of trouble with using eye pencil.|`|Q7j8yYxuaa	eyeliner....i like MAC, avon they don't wear off that easily and apply easily.|`|WgQyGnrxaa	I really love Revlon eyeliner, it's worked great for me, I've been using it for a few years now.|`|iq93EKUPaa	I REALLY LIKE TO USE WHITE EYELINER  TO BERING OUT YOUR EYES IF YOU ARE WEARING A COLOER ON YOUR  UPPER EYES
