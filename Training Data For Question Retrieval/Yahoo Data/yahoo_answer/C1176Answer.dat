Neutrogena has one as does Dove.<br>  <br>  That always makes my face look and feel 100 times better.<br>  Then just use a simple face wash and moisturizer (one with a significant spf)|`|ddf965c9d1b1218ffa9131a9a0da9e0caa	here you go<br>  <br>  gylcolic acid 10%<br>  sunscreen with zinc oxide<br>  im a big fan of estee lauder's new timezone<br>  the fragrance is updated so it smells unisex and not girly|`|crHL63Ftaa	botox, liposuction, and a face life yo!|`|BNqrvZyhaa	Go somewhere and get a facial. I don't know if you've ever had a facial but most places will ask you about your problems before the facial and after words will suggest many products to you. If they don't offer, ask. It's amazing what kind of advice they can give you. They know their stuff and will recommend everything you need to make your skin beautiful. for they hair try buying a hair growing speeder upper. If you can't go out and go to a facial place try making your own facial. <br>  <br>  <br>  Homemade Facial mask for ageing or maturing skin-<br>  Take 3 Tbsp sugar and dissolve it in 4 Tbsp warm water. <br>  This mask is good for maturing skin and will help soften the wrinkle lines.<br>  <br>  For the eyes:<br>   Apply plain cool teabags over closed eyes. Don’t use herbal teabags because most aren't as effective. <br>  <br>  look at these websites: <a href="http://www.natural-homeremedies.org/homeremedies-removing-facial-blemishes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.natural-homeremedies.org/home...</a> <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.natural-homeremedies.org/homeremedies-removing-facial-blemishes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.natural-homeremedies.org/home...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buzzle.com/articles/home-remedies-for-dark-circles-under-the-eyes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.buzzle.com/articles/home-reme...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Good luck!

eMSP740Taa	LOL..Yes, i think you are def. over doing it. Twice a day is really all you need. You're just gonna end up clogging up your pores and braking out with all the over moisturizing. I found this GREAT product called Arbonne that actually has a line called "Intelligence" and the moisturizer adjusts to your skin type by itself. It's really neat and affective. Good luck with it all!! =]|`|IdY8lmMfaa	WAT I DO IS MAKE A PASTE W/ BAKING SODA  AND PUT IT ON YOUR FACE AND LEAVE IT ON 4 15 MINS AND RINSE IT OFF AND MOUSTIRIZE 1 TIME I RECOMMEND DOING THIS B4 BED|`|Ypwm67vXaa	I think this is definitely too much, in fact, it might help your skin become more oily.  I would stick to once in the morning at once at night.  Use a light moisturizer with SPF but buy one for oily skin.  Also, you might want to use an eye brightener cream to help diminish dark circles around your eyes.

That's right, and then put some serum [not hairspray or gel or wax, just serum, I find Frizz-Ease serum is excellent] then. After you've smoothed it down on the OPPOSITE side, dry it on the opposite side. So if your fringe is on the left, brush it to the left while blowdrying. <br>  Then, when it's all dry, just brush it back across to the correct side.<br>  <br>  This works for mine and looks lovely. I don't know why it has to be the opposite side, but it works nicely. <br>  <br>  I also don't straighten my fringe as that takes away the nice shape.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, try it!
lEmKvS50aa	Sam, <br>  <br>  Honestly I have 26 tattoos so I'm gonna have to be honest and say no, that would not make sense.

Wa9Zr4HHaa	They look fairly straight, but you have to keep the braces on for a while so that the teeth get used to being in that position. When they take them off, the dentist will file them so that they are all the same length. This is what they did to me. It doesn't really hurt. Good luck, it will all be worth it when you get them off. Trust me. :)|`|2HPa1ETUaa	They are pretty straight. And if you still have to wear your braces for a while, they will probably get straighter.<br>  I think the only way to smile without showing a lot of gum is to watch yourself when smiling, but if you're really happy and you aren't thinking about it, you will smile big, and you won't be able to help but show gums.<br>  If you really hate how much gum shows, you could get your upper lip bigger in the future. They have special implants that can go in lips to make them bigger. And a bigger upper lip for you will cover more when smiling.<br>  For filing, they will file you teeth, if they think they need too, and if they don't and you really want it, ask them about it.|`|dvjC9YEeaa	do you still have braces? they look pretty straight to me dnt be self-conscious bout your teeth people have it woooorse. love your smile<br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  God Bless!.|`|DGDhQBwpaa	they're not perfect yet, but it's ok. they'll get there!|`|FXJqbNAtaa	They look straight to me.

And they probably could file them if you asked.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Yep they look very straight to me. I use to smile like that when I had braces. though you could try, after you get them off, to keep you bottom lip from going down far when you smile so you only see your top teeth and practice smiling to where only you top teeth show. It takes practice. Just get in front of a mirror and practice.

XCtKpwkwaa	You should go to a salon and ask them to put SHADES(thats the name) on your hair. Its healthier for your hair and will make you hair look non grown out as it does grow out.

Then ask them what else you can do to keep the color.|`|6VL5xzlAaa	It's hard! I have been trying to dye my hair brown from blonde and 1st it went a ginger brown, then greenish now its finally brown but who knows for how long!<br>  I found that putting an 'ash' coloured dye over it like people suggest does get rid of the ginger tones really well, but gives it a green tint, i used medium ash brown, if your hair was cold brown to begin with you might be alright but if it was quite blonde I wouldn't advise it personally, try a neutral brown that is medium/dark to cover the ginger? you could try a toner or 6-8 wash to see how it comes out and so it doesn't damage your hair much at all, you can also leave them on for an hour or so instead of the 20mins to get a better coverage as they don't have ammonia or peroxide in so aren't harsh on your hair.<br>  I did use an ash brown (6-8wash) to get rid of ginger and it went greenish then but a warm brown toner over the top and left it in for about 2 hours, that sorted it for now it's a kind of mid brown, so if you get really stuck you could try that but do them both close together incase it goes greenish, cuz thats just not fun.|`|qeNrGoMsaa	I think the problem could be the shade you are trying, if it has any ash, or your natural hair has any red in it, It will happen again. If you have the money just once go to the hairdressing college and for a discounted price they will usually be glad to do a dye job and it's a lot cheaper than salon.....<br>  It will mean they will have to try to understand what you want, and the teacher will help make it that way.

Although they can't guarantee the water not soaking through, it will definitely help.|`|F3OFvSWvaa	yeahh they have spray that make the water bounce off<br>  try a shoe store nd ask tha dude at the counter|`|gUCjkj9oaa	yeah ,wear plastic bags over them in the rain
kCdISEGqaa	I am a female tattoo artist, and have never gotten into the whole piercing thing.  I have two piercers in my shop, but I don't do them.  I like a simple earring in each ear, but anything more than that is not appealing.  Everyone has their own opinions, and I say if it's what you want, go for it!|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Go for the industrial I think piercings are very sexy :)|`|rFMRgHTdaa	I think piercings like that are more for girls, but some guys can pull it off.|`|eEznnpnVaa	All the guys I've known with an industrial have been gay. Just sayin'. For a while I thought it was like that trend with gay men getting the top of their right ear pierced or whatever that was in the 90's. <br>  <br>  Man I miss the 90's....<br>  <br>  <br>  But I digress. Um...the last clean cut guy I dated had nothing but his septum pierced. I thought that was VERY sexy.|`|5RhDnLHLaa	your avatar look like Joe Dirt with brown hair, <br>  <br>  but i don't like guys with piercings, <br>  <br>  but other girls do<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|jWPF6QR6aa	both ears|`|zHdcoKSeaa	Honestly I don't like piercings except in a guy's ear. A little stud right up in the top was pretty sexy that this one guy had. ;)<br>  <br>  My boyfriend used to have his eyebrow pierced before I met him. It was interesting but it was nice he got rid of it. If I were you I'd stick to something a future employer is likely to ignore when hiring you. The ear would be a great spot.|`|NvGqiA4vaa	bmezine.com has LOTS of different types of piercings you can look at. you should really check it out, in fact I have two piercings now that I wouldn't have had if it wasn't for seeing them on the site!!

BnistnrIaa	you have to get the dyes that are specially for brunettes. Should say it on box|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	no it isn't, when you go to the salon or buy your dye at the store, look for boxes that describe the color as "cool" because "warm" or "natural" means that they are more on the red side. if you are talking to your stylist just let them know that you need a cool shade of brown.|`|o1pXRFtUaa	its not always the case. Always choose a "cool" dark brown, that will keep the red out. The boxes usually say "cool" or "warm" somewhere on them, so just look for the cool ones|`|QfN2LUFkaa	use a colour with .1 at the end such as 5.1. you can get tubes from some shops + you need to read the instructions + mix with the right amount of peroxide.<br>  the .1 is an ash colour in the colour, it will not change the actual colour but it should stop it fading into red.|`|JRRsjByCaa	no, your hair won't turn red. theres red pigment in everyones hair (yes, even if your blond or brunette) but some people's hair just shows through more. you will be fine to dye it darker and not have any red show.|`|87r7ruvwaa	Hmm, I'm not sure if it would grab some red.  If you're that worried about it, go to a hair stylist and have it professionally done.|`|A7HNyYvmaa	If you're worried about it, I'd definitely go to a professional. If you don't already have a stylist, check out www.stylistbook.com to find one in your area.

Head & Shoulders Is Great 4 Dry Scalps & Dandruff.  <br>  <br>  For Me, I Used 2 Use Dove But I Soon Noticed It Kept My Hair Dull & Greasy All The Time.  I Switched 2 Pantene ProV & Have Been Using It Ever Since.|`|IPohxAUJaa	if you have dyed hair don't use head and shoulders coz it strips the colour i like it though and i like ones that smells nice e.g herbal essences. i ain't tried dove so i dunno!|`|QfN2LUFkaa	i go for natural ones, don't use head and shoulders if you havedyed hair and want it to stay that way.<br>  dove i have never tried, but it is supposed to be moisturising, right?<br>  if you have dry hair try that.<br>  undyed dandruffy hair, head + shoulders.<br>  normal, go for the natural stuff.|`|F4OKs8efaa	Personally I do not like any of the two. I do not think they have that much to offer. So if you are pleased with your natural conditioners why change? Natural it's better. :)
8iR6XOD7aa	yes they do but amerie is way darker.|`|AA12248492	yeah they do but i think amerie looks different then she usually does in that photo!|`|cf5e9a9ab50a09f46898424fa1952b23aa	Yes I see it|`|yb01tlviaa	They kinda do, therefore I feel bad for Amerie, Kourtney is a sluttttttt.

9D6Y4dYuaa	Hey there!<br>  <br>  The trick is to find a nude color that is different than your skin tone. The reason the lip gloss looks so good on the stars is because it looks natural yet adds a polished look. <br>  <br>  I love Clinique liquid lipstick. They have tons of neutral shades that offer a touch of color and glide on perfectly with a soft applicator. Plus, their lip products have SPF for extra protection. If you're looking for something a bit more glamourous, try Bobbi Brown lip gloss. It combines natural elements with a bit of shine...a perfect combination. <br>  <br>  Also, you can always try out different products by scoring some free samples on websites like 1freestuff.com and cosmo.com. Hope this helps and good luck!<br>  <br>  Stay classy!|`|QrJme3hdaa	This product is very good<br>    <br>   Mary Kay? NouriShine? Lip Gloss<br>  Starry<br>  Twinkle, twinkle like a major star with this luminous gloss. Mary Kay? NouriShine? Lip Gloss smoothes, softens and never feels sticky. The superlight formula is saturated with moisturizers and conditioners – more than 80 percent – so lips feel amazingly soft and supple. It’s also fortified with vitamins A and E that help form a protective defense against wrinkle-causing free radicals and exposure to the environment. It feels as great as it shines and makes your lips look fabulous worn alone or layered over Mary Kay?

Look for some of the more expensive brands, they usually have it. Just remember that where stars are concerned, looking neutral, fresh and natural is harder to achieve.
1ZaGDPsEaa	well i had my nose pierced with the caption ball ring. I honestly let my ring go anywhere on top or bottom. Its personal preference. I wouldn't let it get too close to the top or bottom hole though, because those nasty crusties build up on it. The only place it looked really weird on was right on the tip of your nostril. Other than that it really doesn't matter, play around and figure out which way you like it best!
XCtKpwkwaa	If you are looking to buy uggs and want a cheeper price you should go on ebay. Some are fake and they are gonna be around $100 but I bought some and I like them better than my real uggs, the fur is alot softer. They still say ugg and look like a mirror image|`|gebjlwkPaa	Ugg? Australia is a trademark for that style of shoe in the UK (e.g. from <a href="http://www.iselldiscountuggboots.co.uk/)," rel="nofollow">http://www.iselldiscountuggboots.co.uk/)...</a> Europe and USA. It's now owned by a US company called Deckers. So, in those regions, if you see a boot marked 'Ugg' and it isn't Ugg? Australia, then it's a counterfeit.<br>  <br>  However, in Australia & NZ, Ugg is just a word to describe the kind of shoe, a bit like here in the UK we might call any vacuum cleaner a 'hoover'.<br>  <br>  So, genuine Ugg? Australia boots are the 'proper' ones; anything with a different brand that looks similar (such as Emu boots) are also probably ok, but anything sold with a fake Ugg logo is likely to be cheap rubbish that's worth far less than they're trying to sell it for.|`|Rz9kzGBSaa	the first ones last longer,<br>  i've had mine over a year<br>  and my friend got the ugg austrailia ones and the side ripped in a couple of months|`|m0guePFEaa	both of them have their own advantages<br>  it all depends on your character<br>  the first one is more formal, but the latter is informal, fit for party and travel<br>  here are some good uggs on sale for your information
t4U4DcPraa	If you want them for fashion just specify you want them twisted thin. <br>  " Curly Locks"  (official Dread-I , Rasta name), are usually grown into. Thick locks come about by not separating the locks and thin ones have to constantly be kept up on because your hair will naturally " lock" if not attended to. You can wash them so don't believe the hype but when they are wet and start to dry is when you really have to separate if you don't want them to get thick.|`|jIyvb2OOaa	do itt!!!|`|guAwifbBaa	What color is your hair? Attach a picture so i can tell you if you should get them or not. Hope i helped =)
9U5GV6xmaa	Read the directions on the purple dye, and go by that time limit.Save the cap when you are finished, and use the streak kit, when you get adventurous again! Have fun! Or buy a cap from a Hair Salon.|`|ku5NPnkfaa	Just follow the directions if you leave it longer it will be darker.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	It's  usually 45 minutes...But there should be directions that came with your color, try looking at that, JUST in case.|`|qeNrGoMsaa	Woah, this could be a little dangerous. First you should not need the highlighting kit. If you go to the salon, ask them if they are willing to sell the cap, they may say ok, how about $2.00. That eliminates the cost of the kit.<br>  Then I would proceed with the cap and at the 15 minute mark take a strand completely wipe it off and see how it is coming, if not dark enough repaste that piece and continue. Remember, what look you are going for as for the size of the strands you pull through.|`|B7lybi7Maa	follow the dye time limit.<br>  <br>  cause if left on the hair too long, your hair will dry out and be extremely horrible looking.<br>  <br>  i left dye in my hair too long while doing streaks and the hair i didnt dye was nice and smooth and the streaks were just dry and broken. i had to cut my hair in the end...&& women hate cutting their hair. At least this woman does...|`|0aEkJqubaa	well, i dont really understand what you are doing....<br>  how can you pull  through a cap and use both colors?.....

pi8yKnU7aa	i have the absolute same problem!! i use a loose powder on my t-zone but during the day it wears off so i buy body shop tea tree oil blotting pads and they're really good to use through out the day. make sure you cleanse tone and moisturize daily [please moisturize your skin even if it is oily!]  <br>  hope this helps <br>  ellie xx|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	moisturizer can add grease to your face which will immediately make your face look shiny. use a light moisturizer that is made for oily skin types and use an anti-oil astringent after washing your face.|`|rpCDjnVcaa	i say u use clean and clear <br>  or nutragena <br>  or clearacel <br>  those are the thingies that i use and i had the <br>  smae problems as u did so yeah|`|JDOQI8Uoaa	u should try those morning burst oil absorbing sheets. i use em and they work great. they even work withjout taking off your makeup.
5jsMY4RIaa	Go McDonald's. duh.<br>  <br>   butt implants?? seriously. What if they popped?|`|wLa4rKAFaa	Eat more cake.|`|uzVBctIbaa	Eating fatty foods don't always go to the butt like some people want it to, like going to the stomach, etc. Plastic surgery is NOT the option ! Implants look fake and are painful. Injections are worse : stuff like silicon or hydro gel (and other crap) is injected to your butt . After a while your butt will start to sag and you would have to get injections every year. The best thing to do is exercise your butt ! Squats, lunges, (just look up butt exercises, there's tons !). When doing them, try to use weights and go slow, you will grow ! lol. After doing the exercises, drink a protein shake, or Boost or Ensure Plus so it goes to your butt. And there are pills , which I know people who had great results in their booty. its called Dime Curves you order their pills off their website : <a href="http://www.dimecurves.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.dimecurves.com.</a><br>  <br>  Good luck ! :))|`|Ddfff5psaa	there is a procedure where they take fat from your legs and put it in your butt... don't get butt implants :/  they are more likely to break and pop then breast implants, because you have to sit down! having a slightly large rear isn't as great as it seems also... it's appealing but it's hard to find jeans.|`|2oy5bgs0aa	try wearing skinny jeans the fit just right and see if that helps surgery is not the way to honey|`|ahtArFAdaa	stuff a pillow in ur pants.|`|XgRkqKi5aa	You could do exercizes that help butt muscles<br>  Ballet is really good <br>  You could also try those underwears with the butt built in|`|JDOQI8Uoaa	why dont u try those special exercises that specifically work on increasing butt size??
SW6fButzaa	No, it has nothing to do, do it in the navel to navel is usually a set of 1.6 mm in width and 12 mm in largo.Mientras a madonna or monroe gets a Labret 1.2 also can be 1.6 if the person you want the ball larger and usually about 10-11 mm long.|`|DtG4zpM2aa	Yes, it's much smaller, in terms of the ball size and the length of the ball.   It's much closer in terms of size to a small stud earring rather than the ball of a navel barbell.|`|12R3mikmaa	no there not the same size. when i first got mine done they use a bigger one to start with then after so long u can put your own in. you get much smaller ones.they look alot nicer thatn the bigger ones. ive had mine done for 4years now. hope that helped :P|`|yyIVrngcaa	I'm sure they will start off with a 14g or 16g bar.<br>  the ball will be slightly smaller than the balls you have on your navel. of course they can't start you off with the smallest bar for healing purposes.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	the monroe stud is way smaller than a navel one.|`|eEznnpnVaa	It really depends on the jewelry.From looking at my navel ring I would say a navel barbell stud is bigger than a monroe stud.
ESAMvi4taa	Odds are it isn't dandruff.  Are the flakes white or yellow/orange?<br>  <br>  Dandruff is not actually the white flakes the makes or cheap "dandruff" crap shampoos like Head and Shoulders want us to think.  Real dandruff is yellow/orange because the bacteria that causes it interacts with the sebum on the scalp.<br>  <br>  The commercial dandruff shampoo industry is all about money.  They want the consumer to have to keep using their product because they are noticing all these white flakes and they think it is dandruff, because that's what the companies tell us is dandruff.  <br>  <br>  In actuality, dandruff shampoos are EXTREMELY harsh and drying to the scalp.  The white flakes you see are not dandruff flakes; they are the result of a stripped and dehydrated scalp.<br>  <br>  Please don't use dandruff shampoos.  They are so terrible for you scalp!|`|ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	That happened to me once, too! It was so odd because I have very oily hair, but that was all my friend had in the shower.<br>  <br>  I just threw on some deep conditioner when I got home, put on a shower cap for 10 minutes while I took a shower, and then rinsed it out. Worked fine, just like "lotion" for your skin.|`|C4lwDCkLaa	It is possible that you are allergic to this particular shampoo or something in the shampoo, if you don't normally have dandruff then I don't recommend continuing the use of this product.

AA10281237	Yes, it is very overpriced. The majority of what they sell is stuff that you can make yourself, or find somewhere else for cheaper.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for unusual jewelry, you should check Etsy (etsy.com) as well. It's all handmade (sometimes vintage) and a lot of it is cheaper. If it is a little pricier, however, you can feel better about paying the price b/c you know it's being made by the person selling it, and not being mass produced.|`|vmCkQFbLaa	if its too much for you than dont buy it...you can always go to forever 21 or h&m, but just to let you know, all their **** falls apart within 1-2 years..<br>  the differrence between those stores and urban is that the brand of jewelry comes from another brand and usually in those situations, those jewelry will last longer, and forever it falls apart..no matter how much you take care of it.|`|zon13nY2aa	Yeah it's very overpriced.

Zqtw1riJaa	I have to say, i love your coat ! =) and for the purse i'd go with bag 1... i think it'll look fantastic with your coat.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Number 1 goes with the coat the best. since its bright you don't want something too busy.|`|VJZMMeZJaa	I really Like bag 1,4, and 5. <br>  <br>  Bag 1 is casual and can be worn with pretty much anything, and it goes really well with that jacket.<br>  <br>  Bag 4 is just freakin cute, but I didn't like the way it looked with the girl that was modeling it. So maybe cancel that one out.<br>  <br>  Bag 5 is really cute too. And it would look so cute with that jacket. and it can be used with dressy outfits, not so much casual.<br>  <br>  Well i guess it comes down to if you want something that is going be used for a casual or dressy occasion, bag 1 can be used for either or. I have a bag similar to bag 5, and I got tired of it real fast.
kCdISEGqaa	Do it!!!|`|rFMRgHTdaa	If you go to the right tattoo artist they can make that idea some to life.

[:|`|jWPF6QR6aa	SOUNDS GOOD TO ME AND I'M ANTI-TATTOO|`|4P80Vu40aa	I've kinda thought about getting a tattoo before but I haven't followed through with it. If you really think it will help as a reminder for you to keep moving on through life then I suppose you should do it. But if you can just keep in mind that life is just something that we have to work though then maybe you don't have to do the tattoo in the case that you might regret it later for some reason. As for the choice of which tattoo I think it would look good. I hope that was some help.|`|80I1aHSGaa	I personally don't have anything against a tattoo because it's art and it's one way of expressing feelings. But there are still lots in the society who judge a person on his physical appearance and tattoos are always being misinterpreted. Your tattoo design seems to be good, but you should think how you will be able to stand for it in the future.|`|LYxCuCWhaa	That sounds amazing and don't let anyone tell you not to get something that means something to you. I have a music inspired commemorative tattoo that I designed myself, as well as another music related tattoo. I don't regret either tattoo and I love them.<br>  Your design is fairly original and it sounds like it will be a beautiful piece. Go for it!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|SxCpRAmbaa	It sounds to me like you have really thought about this and are not just jumping in and getting a tattoo.  You have overcome a lot in your life and you want to remember that and push yourself in the future too.  I think that it is a very detailed design that means a lot to you!  My only thought is would you want it somewhere else on your body instead of between your shoulders?  Depending on the size, maybe your arm.  Just so that you see if more often and can remember how important life is.|`|3lsAXL4vaa	yea! do it! i love tattoos i have 7 of them and yours has real meaning|`|JDOQI8Uoaa	hell ya man. go for it.|`|2LDGlA1Paa	(1) Why on earth would you care what strangers think about something that is obviously so personal to you?<br>  (2) How employ-able do you want to be?  I would encourage you to consider keeping tat's (should you decide to pursue this) placed in an area that will not be visible in ordinary business attire.<br>  (3) As a Nurse, I've seen tattoos on elderly people (yes, believe it or not, this generation is not the first to have an interest in tattoo's) that are soooo not becoming, attractive or even understandable (LOL) 50 years later.  Note: gravity works ... will always work ... what's up, will one day be saggy.<br>  (4) Personally, I've never understood why someone would be willing to indelibly tattoo something to their body that they wouldn't be caught dead having hang in their living room.<br>  (5) My own adult daughter has numerous tat's ... some visible with ordinary attire most without.  NO flash ... all her own original artwork.  I don't understand her either.  She got really angry with me when I Photoshopped her arm-band tat out of her wedding picture that I have hanging in my living room.  (grin)  My house, my rules.

B1pxIU4Jaa	Hello there<br>  <br>  For septum piercings it takes about 6-8 weeks to heal completely. Yes, you have to keep the piercing in always.

Sorry!|`|ZjYLTdovaa	you should try using a face primer before you apply your foundation. smashbox has a veryyyy good one for a really great price. if your undecided but want to try it out, id suggest the smaller size|`|hIqi0VCgaa	buy a really thick moisturizer (Olay re-generous) is a good one. Or alternatively if you don't want to spend too much money, you could use vaseline the night before or i find Savalon works best with me. Also there is Sudacreme which give intense moisture. If you don't have time or the money to be buying more products then in the morning, this will sound disgusting but it works, don't wash your face. The natural oils in your skin will mix with the dream matte mouse. I hope this has been a help to you, im far from a beauty expert so don't do sueing me if they don't work.

It stings for a couple of days if put under any pressure [like when you sit down] or when you clean it, but after that it should be smooth sailing [assuming you keep up with cleaning it. Be sure to ask your piercer how long it will take to heal and at what point you can change the jewelry. You don't want to be another case of a rejected navel ring because you changed it after two weeks. Good luck.|`|GBbcsgimaa	OMG!!!I got mine pierced when I was 16,I've wanted one for as long as I could remember but my dad wouldn't let me.I got mine in a piercing salon in Turkey for our summer hols.It kinda hurt like getting an injection only a wider needle though,it hurts when he actually pierces it and then it burns for a day max,the pain just slowly dissapears as time passes.Your not allowed a shower that night and no swimming pools with clorine for a month or 3 ,I can't remember.Oh and after a few days slowly twist it around so you skin won't get stuck around it(gross i know).Anyway,it was tottaly worth it.I love mine.I got a playboy piercing,so hot in the summer:X|`|KXhr79ZLaa	Hi--<br>  I got mine done about 4 years ago after thinking about it for several years.  It doesn't hurt much at all! but the sensation feels uncomfortable like a 'pulling' sensation.  Cleaning it doesn't hurt either but it took almost 2 years before I stopped getting periodic infections (which make the area sore and uncomfortable).  That was kind of discouraging but I hung in there and now it's absolutely great! I love it.  There are also a lot of reasonably-priced websites featuring really cute bellyrings (I just Googled it and found them).  Fortunately I'm not allergic to the non-gold or non-silver metals...if you are sensitive to one kind you may not be to the others.  I have gotten the gold-plated bellyrings as opposed to the regular silver-colored ones; however, they don't stay that color for long.  I found that they tend to tarnish really easily so I don't buy them anymore.  One last thing: your body jewelry will stay nicer and untarnished for a lot longer if you store it in a fairly airtight container.  Hope you enjoy if you decide to do it! It's more for me than for anyone else; makes me feel pretty and sexy which is a good thing, right?|`|yDnWwwJoaa	It didn't hurt me neither to clean it, its so worth it i love it and i would never regret it.

cz5Aj5pFaa	He's not mad at you. Stop asking him if he's ok.. stop giving him hugs.. <br>  <br>  Let him come to you. If he really likes you, but if im correct he said he like his ex? let him have time to get over it. you cant just rush in on a guy after they are done dating.. guys actually have emotions and have a hard time wit hbreak ups. <br>  <br>  A guy should always be pursuing you... be a mystery to him, make him want tot get to know you, dont just throw yourself out there. your a gem, make him realize that on his own. AND... if he doesnt then hes not worth your time and there will be an amazing guy out there for you, someone who cares for you in the way you deserve. your in school??... want a relationship to last? Wait! He'll come when its the right time.<br>  <br>  OH and guys hate when other people ask if your dating.. dont make it obvious you like him that much by going away when someone asks. it will make him uncofortable and want to avoid you. Just play cool<br>  <br>  Stop analyzing :) girls are the queen at that (I KNOW!) but just be patient. Trust. God will bring someone in His perfect timing!<br>  <br>  I used to be the same way. exact same way.. but honestly God was the only one who changed that and thank goodness because now I get to wait until the right guy comes along and not waste time and my heart on other peole.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|8iR6XOD7aa	it seems like he had a girl friend, they broke up, he kind of maybe liked you, he stared liking his ex again, and now doesnt want to talk to you.|`|oOFyIkkTaa	ask him if he still likes u, i dont think hes mad at u, uve dun nothing wrong<br>  hope this helps u|`|yDnWwwJoaa	Sounds like this guy was trying to use you as a rebound. I mean not to be messed up but that's what it sound like. How old are you? I think you should act like you don't care say hi and walk away don't approach him let him approach you. Give him sometime and he will talk to you and if he doesn't well then that means he never had any intentions of becoming friends with you. It sounds like you have a crush on him but don't let it be to obvious because some guys like us take advantage of that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck <br>  XoXo|`|mqlzkJ54aa	I think he still likes his ex and doesn't want to be around you too much to make her mad.  He doesn't dislike you it just seems like he likes her more.. or maybe he thinks of you two as just friends and just wants to be friends..|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	it sounds like he may have gotten his feelings hurt, maybe he wanted a relationship with you and was let down that you didn't too. he might like his ex again too
hDTHHyRkaa	I've used some Olay products in the past, but I found them to be too fragrant (just a personal thing).<br>  <br>  My skin is really oily, but I only break out occasionally (about once every 28 days, haha). I use Aveeno Calming foaming cleanser and the Aveeno Calming moisturizer with SPF and I think they're wonderful.<br>  <br>  I've used other products to try and control the oiliness, but they usually make my skin sensitive, over-dry, and then - ironically - my skin gets all red and I end up breaking out.<br>  <br>  I like the Aveeno Calming line because<br>  <br>  1.) it's not perfumed!<br>  2.) it's non-comedogenic - meaning, it won't clog up your pores (?)<br>  3.) oil-free<br>  4.) the cleanser is gentle and rinses off nicely<br>  5.) the moisturizer absorbs well and doesn't leave you feeling greasy, sticky, or "sweaty"<br>  <br>  Anyway, there's my personal endorsement :). The products aren't designed to minimize oil, but I've found that my skin has become less oily - possibly because I've been treating it more gently.<br>  <br>  When I do get a breakout, I use 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel (which I found on acne.org) - and that tends to clear it up without too much drying.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps! Best of luck :)|`|Yh63ysrzaa	It works so good!  I have trouble with both oily skin and with moisturizers making me break out (and at 33 that is a little embarrassing)!<br>  <br>  I would highly recommend any Olay product!  I even use their soap!  It is a wonderful line!|`|dlsqsAkzaa	It works well. Most Olay products do.

eEznnpnVaa	Google "dermablend makeup". Their make up is designed to cover up anything--including tattoos. I think that's your most viable option, that or wear a one piece. <br>  <br>  And yes, I do think having a tattoo would lower your score. That's how those Beauty Pageant Judge types are...prudes.|`|ec2ee9613c6bdc3dcad61f9d849d618eaa	You would lose points, as a "lady" would never have tattoos (which is so lame, I have a tattoo and I love them!).<br>  <br>  They sell special tattoo cover-up makeup, but under the bright lights, it might look like a big birthmark or mole or something (also not very pretty).<br>  <br>  I'd say go for a cute one piece, maybe a retro 50s style throwback suit (which are going to be big this year). Or, perhaps you can wear a sarong?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I think the make up would be a good idea as the others have said. Someone mentioned Dermablend which I hear mixed reports on, some people swear by it others have complaints with it. I have never tried any sort of cover up so I can't speak from experience. But I've heard good things about theatrical makeup being used to successfuly cover tattoos, the only complaint I've heard about that is that it has a very dull, matte appearance to it as it's made for people on the stage where there'll be bright lights - so I think this would actually be a positive thing in your case?|`|rFMRgHTdaa	If you dont want it to show then you should use make-up to cover it up. They have some to cover tattoo's.

kCdISEGqaa	Bamboo with a touch of mustard for the light brown color.  For the medium green, mix a bit of lime green with gray.  And for the dark green, mix a small amount of black with dragon green and brighten it up with a small bit of gray if needed.  You'll be hard pressed to mix your colors well enough to get a perfect match, but, it can be done.  Please let us know how it works!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Sorry, that is Intenze Ink colors.|`|4vqzkIr4aa	pick up a few tans, a dark brown, and a few shades of green from alla prima. There inks mix very well. There is no such color kit as a cammo mix. Mainly because there are so many different kinds of cammo. <a href="http://www.allaprimaink.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaprimaink.com/</a><br>  <br>  Try this; pick up the some of the inks i just mentioned. Fill a couple small cups about half of the darkest tan u pick up, the darkest brown you pick, and one of the darkest greens you pick up. I say darkest because it is much easier to create lighter hue to a color than a darker. You will have to use trial an error till you get the proper mix. Get you a pen and paper and a tattoo needle. I would start with the browns. Ad a drop of a light tan to it. Take your tattoo needle. Turn it upside down putting the loop end in the ink cup. Spin the needle bar in your finger tips causing the ink to mix. Once the ink mixes check out your new color. Be sure to document how many drops of each color you used on your not pad. So that once you reach the color you want you have your 'ingredients.' And remember you can always a drop or white or black to alter the hue of the color with actually changing the color. So if you think you have obtained the color you want but you want it a bit darker or lighter, white or black will become your friend.

Ue56xZ7vaa	i have a bed head [ the 2INCH THICK ONE] the blue skinny bed head straightener sucks.<br>  my straightener  is really good. i have pretty thick frizzy and wavy hair that is terrible and it does wonders to my hair. im not sure how much it is in beauty stores, but its probably around $100, give or take. i got mine on the internet for way less though.<br>  <br>  also, a really good product that improves straightening performance is Aquage. it's a blue aerosol spray. i spray it a part of my hair right before i straighten it and it really helps make my hair alot softer and straighter. i highly recommend getting some if you want really nice straight hair!|`|u0eTvggDaa	CHI, you can not go wrong with a chi<br>  <br>  i have had mine for about 4 years now<br>  it heats up in about 10 seconds<br>  <br>  yeah it's more expensive though, i spent $200.<br>  <br>  my hair is really wavy, and use to be really thick and ever since i have been using the chi it's actually made it alot thinner.<br>  <br>  but then again you have to be careful using any straightener because it can fry the ends.|`|UYaWH7a0aa	Chi is one of the best straightners out there - Love mine!

vtW3qPZmaa	It's just a basic blocked pore.  The hard stuff is a mix of dead skin cells and sebum.  You can buy the blackhead strips from the drugstore or pharmacy that you apply to your skin, let dry, & then peel off and this will help to clean your pores.  In addition make sure you're using a good cleanser, toner, and oil-free moisturiser twice a day to help keep your skin clear.  Steam can also help.<br>  <br>  Herpes is a virus - on your face it would come out as a cold-sore and doesn't necessarily have any sexual connotations.

And inside the crown it says "Indestructible" or "immortal" in Japanese. That has alot to do with everything that has happened to me over the last year and how I've over come it. This was my second tattoo. It only took half an hour. I've had it a week. :P<br>  <br>  My other tattoo, my first, is of roses. Each one represents someone different.

zlXofrG4aa	Cheapest way to do it is to go to Walmart, go to the fishing/hunting area, and get either 20g or 18g plastic wire.  Cut it down to size, take a lighter and melted one end of it to form a stopper.  Also make sure to sanitize it before you put it in with either washing it with dial soap or soaking it in peroxide and water mixture.  If you're not sure on the size of the wire bring an earring with you and compare it.

TfL5pFBOaa	Okay so here is some good suggestions <br>  For a drugstore mascara i recommend using lash blast.<br>  It is pretty good and in Length and Volume and is clump free you can purchase this at any drugstore for around $7.<br>  A more high end mascara would be too faced lash injection its amazing and makes your lashes so long and it NEVER clumps the only drawback is that it isnt that easy to take off but its definitely worth it. You can buy this for about $19.90 at your local sephora.<br>  For a drugstore concealer i recommend <br>  L'oreal Airwear Long Wearing Concealer Corrector <br>  its easy blending and probably the best i have tried that is drugstore it lasts long and it is also smooth. its about $7<br>  the best high end concealer would be <br>  Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage<br>  this completely covers under eye circles and minor imperfections i use this everyday its $28 at sephora <br>  For foundation at drugstore i would use L'oreal true  match it is ggreat and has every under tone for your skin so you can get that perfect match <br>  and for high end foundation i would stick with mac go tot he store and they will get your perfect color|`|cSGy3DPeaa	Alot of people are skeptical to try Mary Kay makeup because they think it's for old ladies but what got me hooked was the light weight medium coverage foundation my friend let me try.

Pk0YjUH2aa	lol i would have to say my worst hair cut was the one i gave myself when i was about 3-4 i cut my butt long hair up to the top of my ear, but the best part is only on one side! My mom started to cry i was too little to know why she was soo sad about me cutting my hair.. but she rushed me to my friends house(her mom is a hair dresser) then she brought me up to our regualar hair dresser who made it look like it was suppose to be short like that. However my mommade me get my ears pierce and ewear dresses pink dresses. NOt to mention i cut my hair in my mom's room so i left my hair in a pile beside her bed.lol i'll never forget my mom's reaction.|`|rATydvQ8aa	june.<br>  well my hair was a little passed the mid of my back and i told the girl 4 in. off, NOT closed to shoulder length, and SIDE bangs.<br>  <br>  end: she gave me a bob ( hair SHORTER then shoulder length )<br>  and full bangs that were SHORT!!!<br>  all the kids laughed at me.<br>  so i tried to die it light brown.. and it turned RED!!!!<br>  worst day of my life!!!!<br>  <br>  i payed i think $11 for it. I didn't wanna be mean so i told the girl i liked it and payed. IM NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN.

She shaved the back bottom part with a F***ing razor! She still lives today so I survived but it was horrible and I cried cuz the snobs at school picked on me. it was free so can't complain right?|`|dNL4n2oGaa	All of them! I cried.All my friends made fun of me and I never wanted to live at all!|`|1S5AbPueaa	The bangs i cut for myself:(..they were crooked and in order to fix them the salon had to cut them pretty short.I almost cried,but I keep telling myself it is only hair and I wont look crazy forever.I didn't pay for the haircut since I jacked it up myself but I had to pay to fix it.|`|YFi64qyeaa	Worst haircut ever was back in 1983 when my friends convinced me to cut my hair that I had never cut before. Well I walked out with a blowed dried butt cut, yes you know that classic look of the early 80's well that was me. I hated it and I cried, My hair went from almost touching my butt to looking like a butt.My friend thought it was so cute. Guess who didn't stay my friend for long? Worst part , it was right before picture day, so yes I have that school pic to remember the dreaded look. Luckily it grew out by summer and I dyed it blond changed my part to the side and loved it. That friend I had, thought it looked weird. Wonder whatever happened to her?
qeNrGoMsaa	If your tattoos go way up to the neck line, then go for the dressy blouse cinched at the waist but buttoned to the top. You can if wear a jacket of contrast over the blouse to pull colour of the pants.<br>  You definitely can wear a dressy cashmere cap sleeve sweater in a softer colour. Purple, Maroon, Black, and Blazer Blue..... all options.|`|p84eexPHaa	purple dressy shirt that goes right up to the neck|`|LA69leWAaa	Just about any type of top will work - what color are the pin stripes?  The items do not have to "match" just go with.  If the pin stripes are white there is not anything that will not work as far as color - your size will matter for the rest.  How far up does the tatoo go? a nice solid color button up blouse so you can button it as high as you need to to cover the tatoo, if you do a pattern be careful how big and/or bold the pattern is,  and a jacket or blazer. Don't do a pinstripe with the jacket. Too much pinstripe that way. The blouse can be any color, the jacket or blazer a version of the grey.  If you have larger hips or bottom half, the jacket should hit you right about the middle of your hips. If you are a more petite person right about your waist would work.  Then accesorize...if you like the pop of color but don't want it to be too much of a pop - the shoes, purse/bag and jewelry are good places for that. Hope this helps.... oh yeah, watch "what not to wear" on TLC - I have learned alot from them.  and of course, it's just my opinion but it might be a place to start trying on...
AA12327715	If you're going for a light, flowing, summer/spring feeling dress, I'd go with the first one. It's very pretty and I love the color of the flowers.<br>  <br>  If you're going for something that's a little less 'every day' and a little more on the formal-looking side, I'd choose the last one. I don't picture the last one as something that could be worn out on a nice warm day in the sunshine and such though.<br>  <br>  The middle one I'm just not a fan of. The way it's cut and the fabric would make most people look a little frumpy and it would probably add some bulk to your stomach area and make you look flat-chested.<br>  <br>  So, yeah, the first one I definitely love.|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	I like the first one, but it might be too Springtime for this time of year.

Uc1HPeFZaa	Oh, honey, you have really worked that hair over!<br>  <br>  It's good you cut a lot of it off.  But I think if you keep dying it black, you will further complicate the problem.  I recommend you see a professional for a more permanent coloring.<br>  <br>  As for the frizzes, I have curly hair too.  You really need to invest in a leave in conditioner.  Use that, a frizz serum, and a curl cream.  It'll help protect your hair as well as fight the frizzes.  I use Garnier Fructis, and I LOVE them.  (I've tried all the fancy stuff, GF works best and is cheap!)  Also consider getting a deep conditioner, like a hair mask, for weekly treatments to help your hair stay healthy.<br>  <br>  Your hair looks so cute short and black.  Good luck!|`|QkMyhHkaaa	I like the last photo the best. <br>  Your last question; "Does anyone have any ideas as to how I can get the blonde/blue/gray/pink (whatever color it is) that is on the bottom to stay black?" I would say just let it grow out then get a trim then dye it if you wish. For straightening without frizz, I myself figured there must be something out there (some product) available to PROTECT the hair because of usage of staighteners, cause my hair is super thin and I wanted to protect it. Thankfully, there are products out there now for this purpose. Even if you have to spend a little, the protection from drying out (which will cause frizz) is worth it. I did however find this at my local department store and it works great ;  Heat tamer spray (minimizes heat damage) Styles & Protects - professional formula by TRESEMMé 236 ml (black bottle, red fine mist nozzle).<br>  If not this product, stay away from aerosols, and stuff that smells overly powerful.

Pretty much your goal is that she has no reason not to say no. She'll have nothing to hold you back, especially if you have the funds for it.<br>  If she still says no, hell just go for it. She wouldn't kick you out of the house if she really loves you, plus if you keep up you grades and chores after the piercing, she'll probably be ok with it after awhile.<br>  just keep in mind, most occupations do not hire people with facial piercings, and if you're planning to go to college, you wouldn't want it showing during a college interview. Since you still have some time before you need to start worrying about those things, you can convince your mom that if you get it now, by the time comes to start looking for a job, and look into schools then the hole would have healed and you could easily take it out for however long you need to with out wasting you money. <br>  hope it helps, and best of luck, some mothers i know are hard to budge :)

Sometimes, if your skin is supersensitive, it can irritate and you may need a lower dose.  Also, stay out of the sun or you will get blotches from overexposure that can be permanent.  It makes you more sun sensitive.  <br>  <br>  Also, if your insurance won't pay too much of the cost of the prescription, try getting your doctor to write for a large tube (maybe like 60 grams or 90 grams.  Then, you can go to CANADADRUGS.com and save TONS.  If you get a certain amount, you can save the shipping charge.  I got my Rx filled there and they are very professional.  There are other nonUSA websites in places like Canada that offer cheaper Rx fills if insurance is  a problem.  <br>  <br>  I went on Accutane as a young adult and had to go on it twice, but it really worked, but there were a lot of side effects.

Pull it on each side so that it fits you perfectly, and pin it in place. Then take it off (Be careful not to stick yourself with the pins!) and lay it flat. Chalk out the outline of your pins, then take it to the sewing machine and sew up the line. Take the pins out, and try it on right side-out. If it looks good, cut off the excess fabric and do a zig-zag stitch up the frayed parts.

kb9k1jn1aa	Hi there, you should seek professional advise to find out if it is genetic or if there is another cause to the problem (if you want to have a clue, look at your dad or grandad and see if they are are bald)<br>  I would say that if it is hereditary, the only short cut is a hair transplant, although you might not need that yet. Also beware of the side effects<br>  having said that, there are certain products that might help keep your hair longer until science finds a miracle 100% solution for our alopecia.<br>  <br>  If it is not hereditary, that is a good sign as there are some excellent products to help you not just to stop hair loss but also help you to promote new growth.<br>  <br>  Rogain seems to be an excellent product for many people, however it did not work that well for me. I am using something that is working great for me (see the resource box) but gain, it might not be for you and it does not go cheap either (nothing good is cheap, lol).<br>  <br>  I am using a shampoo called "alcepin" prety good as well, but again is about finding the cause first and then finding out the treatment that suits you (and your budget, I guess! :)|`|s32HV4KGaa	Hi, rocky<br>  To recommend some products for you, first I want to tell you a little bit about the cause of the hair loss:<br>  <br>  The Main Culprit in Male Hair Loss--DHT<br>  <br>  Dihydrotestostrone (DHT) is a hormonal byproduct of testosterone that has been shown to shorten the growth phase of hair by retarding follicle growth. While DHT is essential for early development, it can attach to hair follicles as men get older, which causes the follicle to get smaller and smaller, and the hairs to get thinner—eventually falling out. The result is fewer visible hairs, and if left untreated, can result in male pattern hair loss (Androgenetic Alopecia). Inhibiting DHT formation can help prevent early thinning and hair loss. <br>  <br>  "Provillus? Hair Growth Treatment for Men" uses a proprietary blend of botanicals that naturally inhibit DHT formation, while also providing nutritional support for prostate health . Saw Palmetto and Nettle are two key ingredients, both of which block DHT and have been used in traditionally for many years.|`|cxW018C6aa	I wanna know too!!! My husband is only 21, and he's getting a bald spot on the top / back of his head ):  poor guy<br>  <br>  I have heard certain products wont work for certain kinds of balding... does this mean genetic vs hair loss due to damage?|`|deO9AIChaa	God knows, but I wanna know as well!
AjeNkvjlaa	yeah, stop trying to be like her<br>  you're your own person and you shouldn't compare yourself to her<br>  if you do people will just see you as the person trying to look like your friend<br>  my advice is, take a small thing you like about your friend, and develop it in your own way<br>  e.g. if she wears a dress and accessorizes it with certain jewelery looks amazing, buy a dress that suits you and similar jewelery, wear it out to a party, and people will take notice of you<br>  :)|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Good things come to you don't look for it just wait.|`|M3GDjEHtaa	Well whatever you do Do Not tell her you wish you were like her. I had a friend that did that & i couldn't stand her! It was so annoying i wish she would've never said anything to me. First of all you don't want a bf they're trouble...just focus on school & figuring out your own good qualities. Every person is amazing in their own way, we just have to figure out how to make it stand out. Good Luck :)|`|nDHzrfvSaa	Why are U jealous of her??U urself are a great person.envying somebody,especially somebody who is ur friend is morally wrong.be happy for her and work hard to make ur life good instead of bickering about her life.Be positve and glad to be urself.nobody else can play that  role but U.<br>  <br>  Hope it helped<br>  <br>  take care.<br>  <br>  GOD BLESS U|`|6fPF6xp4aa	I know how that feels, we girls will Always be jealous once in a while. I think you should talk to her about it and tell her how you feel. Ask her to give you make up and fashion tips so you could dress more like her. A good store to check out will be Forever 21 best clothes ever! Hope I helped
Hl0pXlmRaa	Name brands, dont mean high quality at all some of the most expensive items of clothing out there fall apart with ease. Trust me I have worked in retail. We had high end shipments of clothing coming from all over the world it doesnt matter if its italian or made from a third world country.|`|zTLuK65laa	No! I think that schools with lots of, 'groups,' of girls, and guys, that all wear clothing from AE, Hollister, Abercrombie, etc, are intimidating for others. People should not be judged based on clothing. Expensive, cheap, stained, ironed, Wal-Mart, Michael Kors.<br>  <br>  I go to a private school (for the education, I'm not rich). Most of my friends wear T-shirts, jeans, and Uggs, or tennis shoes. We don't all wear that stuff, though. (it's mostly AE, Hollister, etc.). I have five very good friends who shop at second-hand, discount stores. During this economy, many people are. Don't tease, or judge people by how they dress. c:|`|rj3mi8vJaa	The brand names are the most expensive because they have the best qualities. You don't have to wear brand name clothing just to make you look cool. Just wear clothes that makes you feel comfortable, that's  what matters.|`|HTBQLpdIaa	no,<br>  your personality/how you act makes you cool.<br>  im in middle school and who cares if u wear name brand? its just a name?|`|d8EYaNw2aa	I wear brand name clothes and i love them because they are soft and last for a long time!|`|TtZ9zQpraa	fo sho, to be the part, you gotta look the part first.|`|gQi0TxTIaa	no, i dont think they make any difference at all|`|fy4ivQp2aa	depends?? my school is the same .....I luv<br>   abercrombie=)|`|st5reHVjaa	do cool people wear brand name clothes? yes<br>  do brand name clothes make you cool? no<br>  <br>  obviously, just because ur chest says hollister u wont be automatically invited to the cool table.<br>  i know pleanty of cool people who dont wear hollister or abercrombie<br>  and pleanty of people who arent considered cool wear everything abercrombie<br>  it all boils down to personality.|`|mwcaGj06aa	no it's your actions that make you cool not your clothes|`|Dmn8UxSyaa	they're really not related. im not saying that good style and social status aren't related but namebrand, hell no. tasteful and well dressed can do wonders, it has nothing to do with where the clothes come from.|`|TiS89hj1aa	No they do not make you cool.  It's not who or what you wear it's how you wear it.  non name brand clothes are cool you just have to know how to wear them and what to pair them with.|`|FoxTcv4Zaa	Not really, but it gives an judged idea of what people base your status on.  Say you wear clothes from GAP but your all gangster etc.  Peoples first reaction could be "poser" or so... But it also depends on your personality!|`|N9RRfjOHaa	usually people who are 'cool' wear it, but it won't make you cool if you do. its mainly about personality.
QxQxVPnraa	My hair is EXACTLY like that, what i do is after i get out of the shower i kink it in my hands a little so the curls are more defined and then I use moose to get rid of the frizz and keep the curls longer<br>  <br>  and when I apply the moose I scrunch my hair together|`|dxpAcsG5aa	my hair is the same way.<br>  i straighten it though.<br>  if your looking for something that makes it less frizzy, Dove shampoo & conditioner in the lavender colored bottle works really well, and so does the other dove syrum in the purple bottle.<br>  you could wear your hair in pigtails, but have them low. like with the elastics right under your ears.<br>  or you could pull it have up and leave half of it alone.<br>  hope i helped.|`|8iR6XOD7aa	get an curl enhancer like a cream from sunsilk<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gethairapy.com/products.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.gethairapy.com/products.php</a>

I would definently not be able to pull that off. If you want my honest opinion it would look great on you, but I'm not to fond of the cut itself. But you definently have the right kind of hair for the cut|`|qbnrzyCZaa	Go for it you have the hair for it don't waste it when your young live laugh and love. Btw Iove the haircut your going to get.|`|WtM9JnqYaa	Hmm i like it but i think it looks the same at the cut u have now.<br>  Ok im not saying u have a freakishly big nose.<br>  But A large nose is handled a little differently. This facial issue usually requires a style that leaves enough of the face around it visible to balance the features. The hair may be styled away from the face on the sides to make the cheeks and sides of the face appear larger and more in sync with the size of the nose.<br>  <br>  xxxx
Tcu0NWkUaa	Is it made with gold thread?  I doubt that such a dress is even practical.  You can buy 4 or 5 very nice dresses for that price.|`|hvjWpq2naa	got a picture of the dress? if its big time designer you can resell it, or look for the same dress at outlet or consignment shops.  If it is resaleable expect to get 1/3rd the price you paid for it best case.  There are dresses well worth 380, but you have to be able to wear it too. That kind of money you should consider having it altered to fit you best as well, and that will be relatively cheap. toss 100 dollars on top for alterations and your in there. (granted, its going to be something like 30-40)

zkxRKFiPaa	Yes; to all of that!|`|dd9zgkSaaa	Yes, they do have it sometimes. I've never run across any Abercrombie but I have seen a lot of Hollister and American Eagle. It's cheaper as well. You should get at leas 20% off of what you would buy in the real store. They also have a lot of other good name brands.|`|JDQP0Phraa	They probably do. At Ross and Marshall's I've bought American Eagle. They cross out the brand, and they are much cheaper than at the original store.|`|urpDar66aa	yea i know that they sell there jeans for less like 20 or $30's less|`|1LcSsHpzaa	yeah.  they mostly sell american eagle.  they occasionally have hollister jeans.  they sell them for about like $15-$30.|`|afkygHMgaa	I have not seen hollister there nor abercrombie, but i have seen american eagle for MUCH cheaper|`|mgM1Ot3Oaa	yes, but you sometimes have to search because its not only those type of stores but i love that store, theres always good things there. and they are all cheaper than at original|`|LpFKDXQFaa	yes everything foe way cheaper but you just have to look really hard lol|`|Nu7RWvNGaa	Yes they do, they may have the odd and end sizes and things that they haven't sold in their stores lately but the American Eagle and Hollister brand/quality is better for TJmaxx prices.<br>  Also you may want to check out Ross or Marshalls for the same things, they have most of the same prices at all three stores.|`|8iR6XOD7aa	yes but you really  have to look and only some stuff like jeans and pants. no t-shirts or sweatshirts. and everything there has a huge X or some mark on the tag.|`|nSP3Tw0Zaa	they sell cloths... but really cheap ones. they're not really like the ones you mentioned. much worse quality.|`|wYLmaUTRaa	yess they sell like aeropostale and american eagle and it is cheaper too. but not hollister or abercrombie|`|fy4ivQp2aa	yeah they do but i wouldn't recommend tj maxx cuz they dont have a big variety and most of there clothes are out of style|`|ylkaNO9Waa	Yes They Do, Not for so much cheaper, but yes!|`|3iB7bnJGaa	I have only seen American Eagle clothes there so far...but yes.|`|ti9ZlNJ4aa	yes.. and they are cheaper
Qb4P6ruEaa	Get the CHI Ultra.<br>  Its a little expensive (about 150$-160$) but its a good investment. I used to use that brand too but they always broke or the ceramic peeled off the plates.

a4Tij3Xnaa	Very savy....don't forget that black cardi's are very versitile and can be dressed up or down...just change the shirt and add a little chain at the neck or ladies add a scarf and cami, to up it for a night on the town. It is also OK to slide the sleeves up some to show your arm a little. The trick to keeping sleeves from sliding down is use stretchy hair bands and fold the cardi cuff over them to hide them. Just don't get ones that are too tight and cut off the blood flow...lol. Have fun and God Bless, Velle T|`|6pZAs2Q4aa	Ya it wud! Very nice :D xxxxxxx

JDQP0Phraa	They look easily removable. Play it safe and take the bag to a professional; it won't be too expensive.|`|Ao5aSAWiaa	Ew you're right, the lips ruin it.<br>  It looks like part of it is attached to another material. It is probably sewn on, so you can probably clip it and then hem the strings back in or cut them too to hide the evidence. If it looks messy afterwards, you could also dress it up with a few pins or something.|`|Dmn8UxSyaa	probably not. betsey johnson's bags are usually pretty well made so it might be tough to get off without damaging the bag, depending on how it's attatched in the first place. but it's $20? if you've got the money maybe it's worth an experiment. it might be cheap enough. but in all honesty i like the lips. her bags can verge on tacky but this one isn't bad.|`|bLpNuvPiaa	They don't look hard to remove if you know a little bit about sewing, etc. Be wary that the pattern may be disfigured under the lips, though.

MC3C17F7aa	Dip 2 cotton circles in some green tea and let them cool. Then before you go to sleep, put them onto your eyes.<br>  Do this every night for a week and make sure that you go to bed before 10:00 ( make sure you get at least 10 hours of sleep)|`|VTgGRzQAaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  Exactly same advise as my previous advisor. The tea bugs will  help you to get rid off the circles. Just cool them down, lay down and put them on your eyes. If you don't feel so much comfortable with it just use the cotton paths and put them in the tea essence. <br>  This will help you. Of course sleep, relax sleep is appreciated.<br>  If you very stressed or angry try to relax before you go to sleep. Otherwise everything doesn't make so much sense.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

We also have places like Amvets, The Goodwill, and The Salvation Army, they are thrift stores that tend to put out the fancier stuff around prom time. You could probably find something truly unique at one of those type stores. <br>  <br>  Limos are limos, I'd recommend saving up for one or cramming as many people into one as you can and have everyone split the bill.|`|3zxVzPBxaa	just go to a local bridal shop and look at the bridesmaids dresses... some bridal shops will even have a prom section.|`|PIYFf4vyaa	ebay|`|JYQ17wnDaa	J crew has great dresses - I don't know if you would consider them affordable or not.

cMZEmpp0aa	Probably the same place as you bought your kimono.<br>  <br>  If you don't know about Ichiroya, Yamatoku, Ryu Japan, and Kimono Lily you should check them. They often list juban under "kimono" for some reason. You can also search eBay for juban, nagajuban, and the different spellings (e.g. jyuban). If you need one of the two-piece juban, a custom-made juban, or special dancing juban, check on Bokunan-do.
8iR6XOD7aa	do a really loose braid when your hair is wet and leave it in over night.|`|4hQ5xpSTaa	I have done my hair like this several times.  I usually put mousse or gel in before I blow dry it and I make sure I scrunch it a little bit.  I blow dry it with a diffuser and put some more product in it afterwards to calm the friz.  Then, I just touch it up with a curling iron and finish it off with hair-spray.|`|mCoipTkbaa	what she said^^^|`|bp2hibPTaa	it takes a little time, but you'll see the results after about 3-4 weeks<br>  <br>  1. stop using any heat products (flatiron, blow dryer, etc)<br>  2. only shampoo once a week. Just use lots of conditioners<br>  <br>  the shampoo is making your hair more poofy, and staticy. your curls will calm down if you put tons of moisture in them.
yFYeVu4laa	Try an updo. Or like a messy sorta bun.<br>  If you wanna stick with a pony style thing, try keeping a chunk of hair out of the band, wrap it around the band and pin in place.

ESAMvi4taa	Yes it does.  Another tip: mix lemon juice (straight from the lemon) with a very concentrated brew of camomile tea (about 8 packets worth as little water as you can manage).  Use this as a rinse. Both camomile and lemon will lighten your hair gradually over time.  The process is sped up if you put the rinse on, then go out in the sun for a couple hours|`|ku5NPnkfaa	Yeah put some in your hair and then go sit out in the sun and you'll get natural highlights.|`|oCJVZ1WCaa	Yes.|`|nDHzrfvSaa	Yes it does...it is nature's bleach.works for the skin too.clears out uneven patches.but be careful.it does not work for all.some people may develop allergies.<br>  <br>  take care.|`|Zrdg3XJlaa	Yes, it is a natural way to create highlights.

KguUQ9WWaa	Simple products always work for me. They're totally colour and perfume free, so perfect for sensitive skin. They have different skin care ranges for all different skin types. They also have a range of products from make-up removers, to skin care products. I recommend the 'Replenishing Rich Moisturiser' as it is specially made for drier skin, but has the added advantage of reducing greasy skin. For you're pores, they have many exfoliating products. I suggest the 'Smoothing Cleansing Scrub'. It creates a more even textured skin and reduces the amount of dirt in pores. It also contains Vitamin E for a healthy glow :). Simple products are all high street products and come at pretty average prices. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! :).

YB63U3Pgaa	since your hair is super cury your going to have problems keeping it really straight, i bet all these other girls dont have curly hair so it's going to be easier for them. To try and keep it straighter you'd need to have a really good blowdry and then straighten it.  ALso try using a little bit of serum on after you have dried it as well espically in the places that seem to have a mind of it's own. On the other hand you could embrace your curls.

c8f7Htx3aa	Hi Ashleigh! It sounds like you have oily skin. My face used to have the same problem, I tried everything, most over the counter stuff, drugstore brands and cosmetic counter brands clinique, estee lauder etc.. not only did these make me more greasy but several of them broke me out. BTW stay away from primers of any kind they will break you out as their main ingredient is Dimethicone (a silicone ingredient that puts a film over your skin, causing breakouts) My friend told me about a company called faerie organic minerals I got a free sample kit from their site and they are awesome! You have to try them, they are so light and airy but they cover really well, even redness and acne (which I have been blessed with-lol) and they last all day. I wore them in the water at the beach and they stayed on! Thats hard to say about many brands. My advice would be to try the free sample kit, it worked for me. They have a online store here......<a href="http://www.faerieorganic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.faerieorganic.com</a>|`|nHi1mioBaa	i dont know if it can absorbs<br>  but im sure they melt off ur face<br>  make it oily and greasy rite?? then yah,,its melt off because of sweat and humidity|`|96ndKQncaa	Pores can. always use toner before you wear foundation after washing your face. it will give you are more fresher look! and your skin wont look terrible!|`|QMgN7E4Saa	skin cant exactly absorb makeup but if there is to much on it goes away faster. the best way to make sure that it doesnt go away is to use as little makeup as possible.

LMaP6flQaa	It's all just a scientific magic trick. That foundation comes in different shades so you still have to buy the one that matches your skin color and when mixed or molded the white changes to  that color. If you mix the foundation in a container it will change to whatever shade you bought, same as on your skin. It doesn't adjust to your skin color.|`|TfL5pFBOaa	it really doesnt work that goo ... it is just basically a light foundation (not very pigmented) so it will blend with more people's skin type. It didn't even cover minor flaws on my face, let alone a pimple or something. I tried the blush and I am pasty, pasty white and I couldn't even see it. So if it won't show up on me, it won't show up on anyone.<br>  <br>  Have your tried L'Oreal True Match or the L'Oreal HiP foundations, they are very good at matching skin tones for drug store brands. They are based on 3 different undertones so you can get an exact match.|`|hbtCPs5qaa	no no & no<br>  i have never matched any of their past brands or this new white one, it's way too sheer more like nothing! <br>  so why buy?<br>  i am still in search of cheap and good founda.

AILK0BTiaa	i heard this is not abnormal and there is nothing you can do about it.. you can try those vitamins if you want, but i don't think it will change your white spots.. the spots are not a sign that something is wrong.. :o)|`|wC51rE1gaa	thats from a lot of calcium|`|H6ixrUYLaa	My doctor told me a couple years back that it was from a lack of vitamins.|`|HtgF2zyNaa	white spots on your nails are actually bruises on your nails. so you probably do get them from playing guitar- but it's not a big deal. everyone gets them. :)<br>  <br>  okay- dont listen to people telling you you need to go to the doctors lol it was in my seventeen magazine that WHITE SPOTS ON NAILS ARE BRUISES. it's not the end of the world :)|`|3w7VztEWaa	ya know i heard that those white spots are from a lack of iron.<br>  but i'm not sure might want to look it.<br>  Sounds like it could be from your guitar.<br>  btw i love what your playing.<br>  I love instrumental music.|`|UbttbnDKaa	CALCiUM:]]|`|sOkTUYq7aa	it could be.. try taking a break and don't take those supplements for a few weeks.  If you see it go back to normal, then that's probably why.  But if it still persists, go to a doctor.

ZFwC23mqaa	As long as it isn't a very lush suede and the dirt hasn't sunk in (ie. splatters of mud) dampening a piece of kitchen roll and rubbing at the dirt wont do any damage.<br>  If the dirt is more like stains from water, grease, or deep smudging, then i'd advise buying a suede shampoo- they're pretty cheap and the safest way of treating suede shoes. You can get it at a shoe shop, and what you do is dampen the stained area with water, rub on the shampoo, and wipe off with a damp cloth =]|`|iL3UuW5qaa	if you're in the u.k. there are shoe repair shops that sell cleaning cream in tubes.that might help.<br>  if you're in the u.s. shoe stores usually carry cleaning creams.<br>  one suggestion try toothpaste, scrub with soft brush then wipe it damp cloth then wipe it dry with kitchen towel|`|M0eyMvqlaa	Well if you don't want them to fade, I suggest you buy some suede cleaner. You can pick it up at like your nearest sneakers/boots store. <br>  <br>  Exp. FootLocker|`|Khwt4oL6aa	When it comes to cleaning suede footwear, the old adage "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" definitely applies.<br>  <br>  Treating your suede or nubuck shoes with a protective spray or finish will help to repel water and prevent stains. If that ship has already sailed, at least you'll know for future reference to protect before wearing.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, here are some tips for cleaning suede shoes and boots after stains have already set.<br>  <br>  Remember to first test any treatment or product on a small inconspicuous area before tackling a large stain, and only use products designed specifically for the material of your footwear (suede, nubuck, smooth leather, etc.).<br>  <br>  For heavy stains on suede footwear, use a suede cleaning block (also called a suede eraser). These products will crumble as you rub them across the surface of the footwear, and are great for removing even deeply embedded dirt.<br>  <br>  After cleaning, the nap of your suede can be restored by using a suede brush. The bristles of suede brushes are usually made from brass, and often you can find both the cleaning block and the brush in one kit.<br>  <br>  Joe's Shoe Service is a great source for lots of suede cleaning and care products, and they're all very reasonably priced. Alternatively, your local shoe repair shop might offer many of the same items.
LsFUniCSaa	Every time you do it catch yourself and remind yourself to stop. That is the only way and eventually, hopefully it will stop. Do you do it when your nervous? It just takes patience and time.|`|yzIB8Cbiaa	Don't do it!|`|ndw6kLF5aa	I use to do that a lot to. Find something else to do with your hands, thats what everyone tells you but that didn't help me.

A story... you got a good tat idea!!|`|zoe733NJaa	frankly i like "fly high" AND the last butterfly (or the second from the top).  the position's ok but the top butterfly would look weird on it (unless you downsize it quite a bit) coz it would look like it's eating up your b*tt.|`|QikvnTnqaa	I like your idea. With "Fly high." I did the same thing. I got a memorial tattoo for my grandma when I turned 18 too (long story). <br>  <br>  I think you have a great idea.

L0FPStGxaa	Where are the pix?|`|C5PyVxu8aa	first of all you don't have a link to the pic and you didn't describe your hair type.....
OtN6da6uaa	I guess I would consider how long you have been considering the tatoo, and maybe your age before giving an opinion about whether getting a tatoo is right for you.  I would suggest that you go to many tatoo artists, check out their work, get their input on style, placement, size etc.  <br>  <br>  This sounds like it is a very personal and empowering act for you--  make sure it is done in the best way.  Because it is so personal, and doesn't sound like something you are going to grow out of, I would say its freekin' cool...  follow your inner voice, from personal experience it is difficult to hear it when you are dealing with an anxiety disorder.<br>  <br>  I don't get the different language thing.  Why disguise something so powerful and meaningful as a personal affirmation?  Just incase your interested though, that saying is a rip from this one by an 18th century philosopher named Friedrich Nietzsche:  "Out of life's school of war: What does not destroy me, makes me stronger."  From his work "The Twilight of the Idols" published in 1899, the year before he died.<br>  <br>  (I've always been a fan of the quote myself...  never knew about "Out of life's school of war" part though.)|`|dl9Ajz5Paa	I would say get it if you truly want it but it is overrated so just get it on your inner bicep or maybe the ankle or leg.|`|PKRZtwyHaa	Do Not Get it|`|m0KleJrvaa	I'm getting that on the inside of my left bicep.|`|qJcoJutAaa	Well you could get it in latin or gaelic and it would be a little less cliche<br>  <br>  a good place for quotes is across your ribs to one side<br>  just make sure you get a good tattoo artist cause if they mess it up the ink could bleed<br>  <br>  <br>  stay strong!|`|lvF5mvlhaa	IMHO don't get the tattoo, just live your life that way.  Tattoos are graffiti for the human body.|`|vDky5V15aa	I would say, wait. At least a year. If in a year you still want it, get it. As far as placement, you could do an armband. It should be easy for a good artist to incorporate it into a celtic knot or tribal piece. If you wanted to get more creative, or a larger piece, you could get it in the text of a book or in a swirl of a tornado. There is some great work being done with a style called stippling. It is a bunch of tiny dots put together to make an overall picture. Very cool, if you can find someone who knows how to do it.|`|QikvnTnqaa	Maybe on your leg? I was going to say on your upper back. But it wouldn't exactly be easy to see....maybe small on your upper arm.<br>  <br>  And if you want this tattoo, don't let anyone change your mind. It sounds like that quote fits you perfectly. Don't let anyone change your mind.<br>  <br>  :D
nspaGCh9aa	I like both.  Baths are relaxing but the down fall for that is that is that you are just sitting there in your own dirt if you think of it that way.  I like showers because they are quick and soothing.|`|kUhcypC9aa	I love long, hot bubble baths but for quickness then it has to be a shower!! :) x|`|bed3c9511d819eabe6d4a233bf96d01caa	A Shower.|`|DySUxIn4aa	Shower, baths you just sit in your dirt.|`|CiczhPboaa	well think of it this way...... better environment is better for u and a quick and  easy shower is better for tha environment<br>  <br>  but bath's r more relaxing and sooooothing!|`|NKpZGdtraa	depends if I'm in a rush I like showers and if I need to relax or if I'm sore I like baths|`|nOoPtw97aa	I love to have a bubble bath, but most of the time I'm in a hurry so its a shower for me|`|kiDys3dGaa	shower|`|RWYMy7jOaa	I love cold showers in the morning..<br>  <br>  and hot bubbley baths in the evening.<br>  <br>  :)|`|O71xlcG3aa	To get clean a shower, to relax a hot bath.|`|u7o75zipaa	Shower.<br>  They're quicker.<br>  And having a bath is just like sitting in your own dirt..<br>  Plus my hair doesn't feel as nice because it's sitting in the bubbles, so I end up having a shower to properly rinse it anyway.
Afjt24Dlaa	I'm A Tramp and This Is My Stamp|`|U7CVUv6raa	"Remember that I love you."<br>   <br>  It's the title of a Kimya Dawson CD. It reminds me of world peace. :)|`|WjqmPBYjaa	how about .......love kills slowly....its from the ed hardly line...for sum reason it sticks out..|`|UvhfYAHuaa	Ok bare in mind what ever you get is totally permanent. If you're thinking of getting it where I think you are (your bottom?) I would be very very cautious what it says. I don't know your age or gender but I'm guessing your a young person. I would not suggest that to be the place for your first tat. Tattoos need lots of fresh air and vitamin ointment constantly rubbed in so it will heal right. Besides Tats are a part of you long before the needle and color start, well most of the time lol. I will give this advice if you are not gay, or bi stay very very far away from things that could be taken in the wrong context. I have one like that. I was called Skittles in a factory I worked at because I always ate skittles candy on lunch and breaks. Well on my right upper arm I got SKITTLES in puffy letters and under it says "Taste the Rainbow" Put 2 and 2 together and you see my problem. If you don't understand ask an adult you trust they will explain it. I like the idea of Carpi Diem. Just before you get it consider the location, what it says and what would you feel if you were in prison with it? I'm not trying to scare you just make sure you think long and hard before you make it permanent.|`|bffa71be9e2af7c9f6b16aba7fa5782aaa	I have "Carpe Diem" it means seize the day in Latin.<br>  <br>  <br>  but i also like "C'est La Vie" it means life happens in french.<br>  i think that tattoos in different languages is awesome!<br>  <br>  my friend has let the good times roll in french, tho i don't know how to spell that!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  goodluck (:

NDQS5HJyaa	I have super, super dry skin, so I feel for you. Like... insanely dry skin. It seems like not many people have dry skin, and either have oily skin or combo. Oh well.<br>  <br>  Anyway, moisturizer, I'm still trying to figure out something I like with that. I've been using one of Olay's moisturizers, but its a little pricey for my taste. I know this sounds really weird, but have you tried Vaseline? A lot of people freak out when I bring it up and start griping about how it clogs your pores (which I can see it not working for people with oily skin), but I use just a little bit of it all over my face right after getting out of the shower. The steam from the shower opens up your pores.<br>  <br>  Body wash wise... I've experimented a LOT with that. I have to say, by far, I keep coming back to St Ives body wash. There's two different versions of it, oatmeal and whipped silk. I just recently got the whipped silk one.. and wow... it's done wonders for my skin. I love anything by St Ives. They also have some nice apricot scrubs, too.<br>  <br>  There is also Clean and Clear sensitive skin facial wash, which is REALLY nice in removing makeup and washing your face. By far my favorite product in that catagory.|`|Svrbzx8Xaa	I have dry/sensitive skin too!<br>  lol<br>  well i would say aveeno moisturizer or olay<br>  those brands are great for sensitive skin.<br>  they aren't heavy and shouldn't clog your pores<br>  and if you wear foundation put moisturizer on before putting the foundation on,it will keep you skin clean and hydrated<br>  Hope this helps!|`|9svahvPNaa	cocoa butter is really good for dry skin =] make sure its the palmers brand though|`|RkjR0VA5aa	Jergens usually has some fast acting stuff.<br>  I use it for my face.|`|F3FblS6Haa	cetaphil is perfect for dry skin. i too have horribly dry skin that sometimes peels if i use the wrong products :/ cetaphil is cheap and really effective. they have cleansers, moisturizers, creams, etc. that you can buy basically anywhere

If you can get to a health store and want it to go away quick, you'll need tea tree oil, echinachea drops and orange essential oil, mix these 3 in a bowl and you will see that sucker gone in 3 days.

cstW6JLIaa	Try using the diffuser attachment on a hair dryer. This dries your hair by enhancing the natural wave, but eliminates any frizz.<br>  <br>  When you hair is washed and wet, use some curl enhancing cream to prepare your hair for drying.

2SxIkm7Xaa	Of course you can with that stuff! Having thick long hair like you do, you can do a lot with it. Even without a whole lot of hair styling products or tools. Yes it will take longer than thinner hair, but looks better after styling!. I'm trying to grow mine back to about that length. I went to get it cut one day, and they chopped it to below chin! I cried when I got home cuz they had to cut it that short to rid of the bad split ends and damage to re-grow again. Mine's now at chest length. Thank God it's on it's way back again. <br>  <br>  Nehow, try this website: <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/topic_124_hair-care-women.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/topic_124_hair-care-...</a><br>  <br>  It gives  you step by step instructions on different ideas of how to style your hair. <br>  I use these types of websites often as I get bored after awhile of the same hair style.

7b5d7721387ea9716cf48828f5d4cc1caa	Depends on the thickness and the length of your hair. If it's short, then towel drying is the quickest way. If longer, then blow drying is the best way!|`|pZVEBEmLaa	Straighten it and make the straightener a bit hot.|`|tgCNwQ2Saa	on a fan?... brushing it until it gets dry...|`|2OUicLcGaa	They say towel drying it gently is the best way. For instance when you're drying your scalp you shouldn't ruffle it or rub against it as this can cause dryness and tangles. The best way is to smooth the towel from the tip to the ends gently then brush it with a comb gently after that and leave it to dry. <br>  <br>  Hope it works!|`|C6Uzs8f9aa	I use a styling mousse that also aids it drying, then just scruff it with a towel for a few minutes.|`|H6D6jlKGaa	there is no other way unless u use a towel which would take ages or buy some wet to dry hair straightners.. I dont know wether any good.. Just a suggestion.

fu4VXe1iaa	I too prefer the second one (actually I prefer the type of dress as the one displayed on the first picture but I don't like the colour of this dress).

It suits your body type a lot better|`|M26uyiafaa	Hi!<br>  Thanks for answering my qquestion about the makeup!<br>  Well, I love the colors in the first one! It is more exciting!<br>  But I really like the second one,  it is very classy, but where the strap connects to the dress it kinda looks like a badge!<br>  So if you want to look chic and classy then choose #2.<br>  If you want to be the life of the party, with all those awesome colors, then #1.<br>  I would probably choose #2 becuase its more subtle....and orange doesnt look good on my skin!|`|jJaEcnulaa	the second one but i think for waht u need that there too fancy they are for like prom here a website i think that you might find dress that you will like www.debs.com.|`|PwW0Ng8Qaa	i'm not a big fan of big dresses but don't let my opinion get in the way of what you like. i like the second one better|`|rUNmgppXaa	2ND ONE.<br>  <br>  but their way to formal for a semi.<br>  go for short dress for it instead.|`|I604R4xNaa	The 2nd one definatly :D|`|SXO1uGrbaa	lol i accualy really like the first one alot better. the second looks like it would be for someone who jsut won miss USA or something because of the strap.|`|p84eexPHaa	I personally like the second.|`|tzBRGk7Yaa	second one . .|`|BiBhoJ9Aaa	i think the first dress would get better with a darker skin tone, and its pretty. but the second one is absolutely stunning!|`|Smgf5oFlaa	the second one it looks really stylish|`|4hQ5xpSTaa	I definately like the second one the best.  It looks a little bit more casual u know?  The other one is just too much.|`|1EyRH1Lsaa	the second one <br>  but i think their to formal for what u want them for
gbjpvp0vaa	High tops with bright colors!|`|BCntAq9gaa	hightops
Mc9pZH5uaa	you can wear a NICE school polo with a blazer, and tee shirts, or striped long sleeves with vests. just make sure it looks nice in the end
qgDCcNQqaa	Wear light eye shadows and white eyeliner or powder on the corner of your eyes, wear only mascara in black or brown because that opens up your eyes.<br>  For lips you can line them with a colour the same or 1 shade darker than your natural lips and fill in OR you could buy a plumping lipstick.|`|y7dypVNtaa	I havnt tried it myself but lots of people say if you wear white eyeliner on the wet bit of your lower lash line then it makes small eyes appear bigger. then like put mascara on the lower lash line so you cant see the white..and use a lengthening mascara to widen out the eyes. dont use harsh black eyeliner on the top either as this will make the eyes look even smaller..i have small lips and i found this lipgloss thats really weird but amazing. its a plumping lipgloss and costs around ￡8  but it lasts ages and makes your lips look so much bigger without you looking stupid! Its called Soap & Glory Sexy Mother Pucker..lol weird name but its really good!|`|oBOQUe9Saa	Lips:<br>  Just wear a shiny lipgloss because when light reflects they wont look so small.<br>  <br>  Eyes:<br>  If you like eyeliner, apply it on your lower WATERLINE only HALF WAY from the outside towards the inside, eyeliner on the inner part of your eyes makes them almost 2 times as small looking.
SiniSj1eaa	I think the pinup hairstyle is hot....<br>  <br>  dont know how to do it though. I dont have the hair for it.|`|zon13nY2aa	Your best bet is to find a retro style hairdressers. I girl I know went to London and got her hair styled in a 50's style and she loved it, and they showed her how to do it herself. Just google 'retro hairdressers' in your area. x|`|INlDPJMVaa	yeah... don't do that...|`|7MuFMepgaa	YOU DONT WANT YOUR HAIR LIKE THAT _ TRUST ME!!!!!!!!|`|62oLK3wsaa	o gawsh please dont
iMoTw1wIaa	I'm not going to give you crap about doing this yourself, you obviously know the risks that come along with it.. so now is the time to use the common sense you've already got and take it out, let it heal and in the future, get it done again. The area around your eyebrow does have some very sensitive nerves and if damaged you could cause yourself some rather serious damage... on top of the fact, that if you have to push it in you are most likely going to scar. Eyebrows are a progressive piercing, so they do grow out of most people in time. This is a normal thing to happen. If you push it and force it, you could cause tearing and scar tissue, swelling and infection. None of which you want. Just pull it out hun, clean the area with a good antibacterial soap and leave it be.|`|0Ji5L32gaa	stick the needle back in the hole, and move it from side to side to open the hole up<br>  <br>  then shove the ring through<br>  <br>  good luck
kogageqzaa	tanning pills sound so unsafe!! is a tan really worth putting those chemicals in your body??? no!! just go to a tanning salon at least!|`|0fhCbS7Daa	i always tan with sun. all these tanning machines and pills just put UV rays into your body which might increase your risk to skin cancer.
Sv0SV0E1aa	Loreal True Match and Super blendable makeup line is very good. It goes on easily and it wont come off. Also Neutrogena minerals, and Physicians Formula. All their stuff is great.
ZIyZRGftaa	I would poof the back more and not so much the sides, also if you curl the back a little bit with a big barrel curling iron and just straighten the sides it may help get your orignial look back.|`|GXM74MGPaa	Curl it. Pin it up.|`|sO2CKU1uaa	that's alright, i'm happy just how i am|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	You wear it the way you have been wearing it since it grew out ...?!
ocqSP3ogaa	yes! you're freakin' GORGEOUS!<br>  <br>  it's true! you have a clear face, no blemishes, gorgeous facial structure, pretty hair!<br>  <br>  you are GORGEOUS.|`|gYyW39wTaa	You are a very pretty girl|`|RLK401pgaa	yeah your really pretty in a natural way,|`|odEAUvHDaa	Yeah you could commercial model|`|mYjtC4Graa	Yes|`|GJfvCSzraa	Yes.God your so pretty.|`|J9Rgy02baa	You should get into modeling, definitely. You have high cheekbones and your skin is really clear. Your dark hair perfectly complements your light skin, but your complexion would work well with almost all colors, which is good for modeling. <br>  But it depends on what type of modeling you want to do.<br>  Here's the facts:<br>  If you're under 5'4, it's very difficult to get into in the first place. <br>  If you're under 5'8 you would be good for commercial modeling (like magazines, ads etc.)<br>  If you're 5'8 or taller, you would probably be a runway model. <br>  <br>  You also look very young... so if you start out with commercial you can always become runway if that's what you want, and if you get that tall. <br>  <br>  The negative side of modeling, though, you really do need a perfect body, especially for runway. I'm not encouraging anorexia or anything, but flat stomach, good butt, nice arms and legs is what they really want for commercial so that the clothes fit perfectly. Runway is even more extreme, the clothes are meant to just hang on you, so you would need to be even skinnier. <br>  <br>  Make sure that you keep your hair very healthy and take care of your skin. Try to keep it as blemish free as possible and always wash the makeup off. Wear a good moisturizer to avoid wrinkles and try to find one with an spf (even as low as 10) to keep your skin nice. Having good skin is veryyy important.<br>  <br>  Those are just all angles on modeling. Just so you know, but you're pretty enough to be a model, your face is more commercial.|`|U7CVUv6raa	Yes, you're very pretty. But modeling is silly, it just makes people feel bad about themselves. :(|`|nQFQaEngaa	awiii<br>  yes you can!!<br>  very cute!!|`|k54u7P0maa	you keep using the same pictures for different questions|`|ggSo0fkAaa	sure|`|yUNlUjvGaa	no
eX8i4vwRaa	i dont think so; well i hope not cause i have three lmao<br>  but i keep the earrings small so its not overwhelming and i keep it kinda classy by just wearing 3 kinda small diamond studs all the time. i dont ever wear hoops or anything else.<br>  and i think it looks good :)|`|HRRfZDQqaa	no its cute|`|WViHuDsDaa	I think it looks cute.|`|piqkAV1Xaa	n0t @ all|`|yrza9o9Taa	no i have seen like more than 7|`|8OlPuLSJaa	no my grandma has piercings all up her ears
jez0O0bXaa	Use product and style them that way. You can bring them straight up and trim straight across this will at least give a layered effect.|`|BuctVReEaa	Get a good Hairdresser to layer your bangs and then use a bit of product, such as mousse when you blow dry it in shape. Be clear and honest with your Hairdresser about both cutting your hair yourself and also about exactly how you want your hair to go, as if you have been really "scissor happy" as many home-made haircuts are, it may take more than one haircut. Take this as a good lesson learned, cutting your own hair is not often a good idea!

kTnEWjvcaa	Dark brown highlights would be a good call if you don't want something too WA-POW!<br>  <br>  But caramel or toned down reddish highlights will also look well with black hair.<br>  <br>  As for doing highlights yourself, what I always do is pull out the aluminum foil and a tinting brush (they are cheap... .69 cents at Sally Beauty Supply).<br>  <br>  Section your hair, and take a small chunk of hair. Place the foil underneath as close to the root as you can get, dip the brush in the bleach and paint on. MAKE SURE THE HAIR IS EVENLY SATURATED!<br>  After you get done with applying the bleach, I fold the foil inwards from the sides, then up an inch from the bottom, then the whole foil in half. I'm not experienced with this so please don't sue me if I'm wrong, lol! I did this for my whole head a few months ago though, and it came out really well. Foiling is always a good choice when lightening.<br>  <br>  Sorry this was a wall of text, but I hope I helped you in some way!<br>  <br>  Happy highlighting!|`|zgBelCROaa	You can try reddish brown but it will probably not show up if you use an at home dye. They really only work to make lighter hair darker. Since your hair is black you would have to lighten it first then apply the color you want. That is very tricky.<br>  <br>  If you still want to try it use a clairol brand like Herbal essences. They some that come with a special tool to highlight your hair. Just make the dye and only put it on the strips you want to highlight.|`|06jHpgRDaa	how:buy a box & read it.<br>  brand:revlon<br>  color:maybe medium brown or medium brown w/ light blond|`|l6yn08LNaa	Hm maybe red or blonde.I tryed doing highlights by myself it's really hard.And it got messed up.I hate to say this to people cause some people don't have money to do it.But you might have to go to a salon.But if you think you can do it.Go ahead and do it.And dark drown would just blind in with your hair.Cause dark brown is almost as dark as black.Good Luck.=)|`|S93MrATlaa	Yeah, I agree.

a1WK8NtYaa	Take biotin pills, found at wal mart<br>  and trim dead ends like once a month also eat healthy<br>  & coconut oil|`|0cCZkuBOaa	Don't cut it|`|Zi6Fr49Laa	Yes. LAY OFF applying heat to your hair, such as with a flat iron or curling iron, and even blow drying. Only style your hair with heat for special occasions or when you go out, etc. But for every day, like at work you should consider wearing your hair up if you must in order to avoid using heat to style it. After awhile of going without heating products your hair will be so healthy that you won't need the heating products to make it look good. I know back in the day when I would always straighten my hair with a flat iron my hair would look crappy on the rare days that I DIDN'T use the flat iron. Now it looks great all the time, and awesome on rare occasions when I use heat. <br>  <br>  USE Redken shampoo and conditioner for your everyday washing. Try washing every other night rather than every night to reduce breakage. When you clean your hair, your hair dries up some, making it more breakable. Also, the less you wash it, the less it is wet, which is another time that hair is very fragile. After you shampoo and condition your hair, put in a leave-in conditioner. Do a deep conditioning mask once a week. <br>  <br>  Take prenatal vitamins. The extra nourishment is like miracle grow for your hair and nails. <br>  <br>  Go for a trim every 6 weeks to get rid of dead ends that could potentially split even more, making hair shorter. <br>  <br>  Also, dye your hair a darker color. DO NOT bleach in order to make your hair a lighter color. Your hair will not grow, I promise. The women in the playboy mansion and in Hollywood are all rich and buy blond extensions. That is how long pale blond hair is achieved. In the real world, the majority of people with long hair are dark-haired. This is because darker colors coat each individual strand of hair, making it thicker and less likely to break. I'm a natural blond and have dyed my hair darker colors for years and years, and now I have very long hair. Every hair stylist I go to comments on how incredibly long my hair is for having such a fine texture. I know what I'm talking about. Do these things and your hair will grow.|`|mgdkr6hvaa	Don't cut it too often(but do every couple of months to trim split ends)<br>  Try shampoo's specifically for growing long hair. <br>  And idk if it works, but an old myth i've heard is if you like lie upside down like on a bed with you head upside down and hair down, for like a minute it makes your hair grow faster. i guess like blood rushing to head or something. Why not give it a shot.|`|gXxEsWcxaa	Okay, my sister is a hair person thing (i'm not sure what it's called) and here are some things she has told me...<br>  1.) Eat a lot of yogurt (*and protein) it has a special ingredient inside to help it grow, I've been told.<br>  2.) Massage lavender oil (any oil will work but lavender works best) 2-3 times a week on your <scalp>. Leave in for about 20 minutes and then wash out with shampoo and conditionor.. I recommend Suave.. it is really good..<br>  3.) When you have conditionor in your hair continue to brush it, then wash out.<br>  4.) After you get out of the shower make sure to blowdry it brushing your hair straight down until your hair is dry.<br>  This is what I have been doing for a couple weeks now and I have seen changes. Trust me, this works.<br>  --Also make sure not to straighten it TOO much.<br>  and also make sure to eat healthy. :)<br>  And wear your hair in a pony tail, it helps a lot.<br>  I hope this helps you! It sure helped me!<br>  Good luck! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And, what I also do, is kind of silly but I put in mayonnaise and leave it in for about 15 minutes, and then wash it out.<br>  That works too.|`|EQXy6WTxaa	i want long hair|`|QLHOI60daa	Just take care of it, try not to use too many heat products on it (blow drying, straightening, curling iron) also try not to color it too often. So then that way it is healthy and it will not be necessary to get a hair cut regularly so you can grow it. Good luck!|`|TyZYlRDRaa	dont cut it and dont pull on it with your brush cuz you'll get split ends (that slows it from growing) make sure your ends are healthy, if not, trim it a bit|`|zUysiBHCaa	Extensions.<br>  <br>  Only wash it every other day.<br>  <br>  Give it time! Some hair griws faster then others. That's all I have. :D|`|znlnIPTyaa	Be patient young one.|`|PogGNoIkaa	not cutting it helps and waiting for it to grow|`|P3OWfxi5aa	just wait it will grow
M8HUQSrkaa	-Lying out in the sun can help.<br>  -lemon juice<br>  -Sun-In|`|TS8R2jugaa	Sun-In<br>  or lemon juice.<br>  <br>  Spend lots of time outside.|`|TdRgGCJPaa	Ok. I went through THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM!!!! I was pretty sick of my dirty blonde hair so I took some advice that I found on the internet. Lemon Juice. It honestly worked wonders on me. Now, you'll probably have to wait until summer or at least the spring (and the spring is comming soon which gives you just enough time to get the Lemon Juice if you do not have it yet :)). So anyway, I put the Lemon Juice on and I sat in the sun for a while. It worked well. I also heard that their is a product called Sun In where you put it on your hair.<br>  I would highly suggest getting highlights, since they are DEFINETLY worth it. The salonist may comment on your hair though after the lemon juice since it looks slightly diffrent from the top of your hair, although I don't think that it is THAT noticeable unless you are staring at your hair like a salonist/hair person would.<br>  Good luck with everything!!!!|`|lbv37h4Uaa	spray lemon juice on it and then go in the sun
TfL5pFBOaa	I was reading seventeen one day when i came across a page that talked about using different products for different purposes. One was making you own lip tint..it said to mix a dome sized amount of Vaseline with some champagne colored eyeshadow..the color is really pretty and it stays in and moistens your lips.

Before your period arrives your body produces a lot of oil making you breakout. Also take a look at your habits: are you cleaning your pillowcase every second night? do you have bangs that are sitting on your forehead? Are you applying your foundation with a sponge or brush and not cleaning it? Wash your face with an antibacterial cleanser like Clinique's Acne Solutions bar and then make sure you apply an oil free moisturizer AND foundation. Or use an oil free tinted moisturizer and  a full cover concealer, but you always have to make sure it says oil-free on the back. <br>  Hope I helped hun!|`|llTEagZMaa	just use proactiv. it really does work. even if you dont have acne. it prevents breakouts and pimples and softens your skin.|`|MrPwK9s7aa	ProActiv. And reeactions dont last that long. Also hydrate your skin. Difinetly use ProActiv.|`|P1YeBCnaaa	mary kay works great, im a guy and my acne lasted since I was 14 until 21....  not to bring you down or anything but it really depends on the persons skin|`|BGCiqQFgaa	Try going to a dermatologist and washing your face regularly|`|kGSZvLxbaa	Wash your face EVERY NIGHT AND EVERY MORNING for at least a month with a cleanser, then a moisturizer, then acne treatment. If it still isnt working try swapping your cleanser. That was the case for me. Also DO NOT pile on the makeup. Right now, incas your interested, my skin care routine is for morning and night:<br>  Spectro Jel Oily Skin Cleanser<br>  then<br>  Cetaphil normal to combination moisturizer<br>  then<br>  clean and clear (white stuff not clear) acne treatment.<br>  But I just use those cuz i have combination skin. If you have dry skin, obviously dont use oily skin treatment lol. If it still is bad, check the foods your eating. Every week dont eat something (ex. go without white bread for a week, or choc) eventually u should find the thing thats making your acne worse. Oh and drink 5-10 glasses of water A DAY. If this still isnt working, go to a dermatologist. Good luck!
24sK6L2uaa	Some people swell some people don't some people have pain some don't and some have crusties and some don't/ Just keep cleaning it and be happy its going so well.|`|2dya7YeKaa	Do NOT rotate it, that will not help you at all.  If you rotate a healing piercing you risk tearing the fistula, rotating dirt, bacteria or crusties (even though you say you don't have any you may have a slight amount you cannot see) into the open wound and cause infection.  No need for rotation.  Taking it out is a no-no as well, you cannot remove jewelry until the piercing has healed.  Removing and reinserting jewelry in a fresh piercing will just cause more trauma and prolong your healing time.<br>  <br>  It is great - really! - that your piercing looks and feels good now but keep in mind that a lip piercing takes 2-3 months to heal.  Some of the stuff your piercer warned you about that you aren't seeing now could certainly crop up later.<br>  <br>  You don't need to clean the jewelry itself as you are doing that when you clean the piercing.  Piercing jewelry is typically stainless steel so it doesn't harbor bacteria.  <br>  <br>  The only change to your regimen I would advise is that you should really be doing a proper sea salt SOAK.  Using saline is all right if you don't want to take the time to mix the sea salt solution yourself (1/8 tsp non-iodized sea salt to 8 oz warm water).  Douse a cotton ball in the saline and hold the cotton ball to your piercing (on the outside is fine) for 10 minutes or so.  If you do this 3 times a day or so while your piercing is healing in addition to what you are already doing you should be golden.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yKETwf0gaa	your fine, its just luck if it isn't to painful for you.  i know mine was sore for a couple of weeks.  as long as there are no signs of infection, there's nothing wrong.... though i still wouldn't advise tugging on it too much.  just keep doing the mouthwash and salt water.<br>  <br>  you need to move the stud around about once a day, if your playing with it around anyway then don't worry.  you leave the jewelry they pierced you lip with in (don't take it out at all) for at least 6 weeks or so.  thats the general healing time.
9M4Tuc2Faa	Black or brown eyeliner, a plum or dark brown eyeshadow, or just a blue eyeshadow.

UojyaVglaa	plucking and waxing can, over time, permanently damage the hair follicle (which would be a good thing if you don't want the hair to grow back) it may take years, however, for this to happen. if the follicle is already damaged though. there isn't anything you can do to make the hair grow back.|`|9dtrWO5laa	you plucked your eye lashes? they should grow back soon, hopefully.|`|nspaGCh9aa	Well it depends.

The worst thing you could do is wear a turtleneck, while it does cover them up, it will actually make them look a lot bigger.  Also, try wearing a cute scarf over your t shirt, it will cover up your boobs, and also look cute, boosting your self confidence.  I feel you on this one, because shopping for clothes can be so hard! the most important thing is to wear the right bra, consider getting fitted at a victoria's secret, and they can show you styles that may make you feel more comfortable in your own skin :)|`|y43XQwUuaa	Your breasts are only too big if you get back trouble from them.

lU8e0VQFaa	I asked about this when we were helping to run a blood drive in college, and was told because most shops are sterile and reputable they no longer require a 6 month waiting period (this may vary by state though). But yes, you can give blood and be an organ donor no matter how much ink you have. <br>  <br>  As for lip tattoos, yes and no, for most people they fade completely away fairly quick, some will have them a couple of years and some will stay forever. Don't get it tattooed just because you think it'll eventually go away, there's no guarantee that it will.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	the tattoo in your lip will go away in about 6 months.|`|53e1c3e3cf69dd882ecfbbb50e404730aa	the ink used for micro pigmentation(used in semi-perminent make-up)is very different to the ink used in regular tattooing,it fades with time,but depends on the person,can be 2 to 5 years,but has lasted longer on some ppl too.<br>  6 months for the blood donation.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	You have to wait a  year before giving blood, and there'd be no reason why you couldn't donate your organs.<br>  <br>  Depends.  Some may, some may not.  Most usually just fade, I don't think it'd completely go away.|`|MV0lMuDMaa	you have to wait a year to give blood.|`|kCdISEGqaa	Don't get matching tattoos.  As a tattoo artist, I see a lot of people who have done such, and they always claim that at the time, they knew they would be together forever, and no one could talk them out of it, and now, they want the tattoo covered up to erase bad memories.  You may say and claim that your relationship will stand the test of time, but, you just never know.  <br>  <br>  You can donate blood if you have a tattoo.  Most of the time you have to wait one year after your most recent tattoo to donate.  And lip tattoos, it's another fad, like tribal, that people will regret in the future.  They do last forever, but fade horribly and look awful after a short amount of time.  A lip tattoo may look good for 5 years if you're lucky.  After that, it looks like a big blob on your lip.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be so negative, but I am just thinking of my experiences.  Best wishes!|`|vG0tsqJtaa	The lip tattoos fade faster depending on the person.<br>  <br>  You can donate your organs and blood after a tattoo.  You have to wait a while after the tattoo though usually.  I think when I have given blood they ask how long since tattoo.  I believe you have to wait six months.|`|puEjSoDfaa	I don't know about the giving blood. But for the lip one of my friends got one really cheap and it faded in a week. My other friend has had hers for 5 years and her brother has had his for like 8 I think,|`|TDtSZLmvaa	you can donate blood 5 or 6 months after getting a tat (i think its six) and im not sure about the lip tattoos...i havent heard anything like that.|`|AA12305234	You can, but you have to wait 1 year before doing so.|`|FDgHnvm3aa	A Silent Reminder is correct. you have to wait a year to donate blood
vBvUub0Naa	There are A LOT of ways to exfoliate. The point of exfoliating is to get rid of your dead skin by scrubbing so to exfoliate, you'd need some type of scrub/exfoliant which you can buy at drugstores, grocery stores, and beauty supply stores. These need to be rough enough for your face/body to actually work. Those face washes with small beads that you can't feel don't work so your best bet would be to go with something you can feel working. <br>  <br>  If you want to exfoliate your body, I recommend bliss products which smell yummy and feel really nice afterward (followed by their body cream). If you want to exfoliate your face, you'll need something a bit more gentler such as orgins modern friction. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/brand_hierarchy.jhtml?brandId=4326&categoryId=S1000" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/brand_hier...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.origins.com/templates/products/sp_nonshaded.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY5978&PRODUCT_ID=PROD7480" rel="nofollow">http://www.origins.com/templates/product...</a><br>  <br>  After exfoliating, be sure to follow with lotion or cream to moisturize!<br>  <br>  There are plenty of other exfoliants but these are just my recommendations so do some research at beauty blogs to find out what might be best for you. Start searching here and then just keep clicking through to other beauty blogs: <a href="http://www.beautyjunkieinsf.com/2009/01/bliss-peeling-groovy-facial-serum.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautyjunkieinsf.com/2009/01/...</a> Message me if you need further help! Hope this was helpful :)|`|VxXRJze2aa	you could make a scrub for your face by mixing some lemon juice, honey and sugar, if you have some mineral oil, you put a couple of drops in there too. if you want to exfoliate your body try using a loofah.|`|c8f7Htx3aa	all you need is table sugar it is a natural form of glycolic acid. mix it with your usual face wash in your palm and rub in a circular motion and wash off!

gPtvKPqBaa	The flat iron and packaging look like a cheap knock-off, in my opinion. <br>  <br>  And, yes, get the real CHI straightener, they're wonderful. :)|`|H2l7tFFHaa	CHI is real but you can also buy the generic brand from sallys beauty supply for about $60 and they work the same!|`|KkVUPatCaa	CHI straightner is THEBEST.<br>   I have two of them & their AMAZING.<br>  end of story.<br>   :)
rrpTvQVkaa	Yes, this one is fake. According to the box pictured, CHI stands for Ceramic Hairstyling Iron. But the real company boxes say that CHI stands for Catonic Hydration Interlink.

3kEzoBWzaa	It's normal to have oily hair. You probably have thin/fine hair, which is why your hair gets so oily all the time. People with thicker hair often seem to produce less oil, but it's only because they have thicker and more hair.<br>  <br>  Shampoo everyday and do not use conditioner on days that you'll be going in public; it'll make your hair oily. I suggest that you use conditioners on weekends and only apply it to mid-strand to tips, never apply it to the roots or scalp; this'll make your problem worse. If you're worried about over drying your hair, leave a day where you don't shampoo to allow your hair to produce its natural oils. [Do this on a weekend of course or else you're hair will be dripping with oil] You should have two types of shampoo on hand because your hair might suddenly "seem immune" to the shampoo, so switching shampoo every month or so would be a good idea.<br>  <br>  Don't touch your hair too often. Touching it or combing it too often will make it it oily faster. <br>  <br>  Make sure you keep your face clean as well. Having oil on your face will make your hair even more oily or vice versa.<br>  <br>  You might also want to consider cutting your hair, if it is not already cut. I used to have long hair, but then I cut it short to allow it to grow thicker. I've had short/medium length hair for two years now and my hair is ten times less oily and my hair's a lot thicker. After keeping it short for awhile, you can then consider growing it out.<br>  <br>  Having thin/fine hair is something you have to deal with. Good luck!|`|v0FlUan0aa	omg me tooo. i think its the natural oils?|`|g2ulTHNGaa	It's probably a combination of the natural oils & what ever shampoo uou are using, plus you could also be using too much conditioner. Go to a beauty supply store & ask someone there to help you.|`|KkVUPatCaa	Wash it everyday.<br>  use clarifying shampoo, but dont use it EVERYDAY;<br>  it'll dry it outt.<br>  && you just have more oils in your hair then most people do.|`|0thjLaulaa	some people just have naturally greasy hair<br>  its not too bad lol<br>  you can try putting baby powder in your hair...its not as wierd as it might sound<br>  and it actually works<br>  =D|`|oaRD2njqaa	Wash it everyday.|`|c98c60d71dbb85f0335e5c7fc391ddd3aa	That is perfectly normal.If your hair wasn't greasy your hair it would break off in clumps.|`|RxSiWBJjaa	First of all, with oily hair, you must wash it every single day.."Often" just does not do it with oily hair. The other thing is to make sure you rinse, rinse, rinse..Sometimes, it is not so much that your hair is greasy as it is that you are not rinsing well enough.Try using a Little bit of vinegar for the final rinse..You can use white vinegar or apple cider vinegar..just a little bit in a glass of water should do it, and don't worry, you will not smell like vinegar, the vinegar odor goes away when your hair is dry..The vinegar will make your hair shine like crazy and also help it be less greasy between shampoos..Never use conditioner on oily hair..that just makes it worse..Try this and you will probably get lots of compliements on your hair.|`|c8xptNSGaa	maybe you could buy some special shampoo for greasy hair..or go to the salone and ask for some shammpoo suggestions for greasy hair. <br>  <br>  <br>  WELL HOPE I HELPED YOU OUT. good luck=)

5jYKYAuXaa	A smokey eye is usually a dark eyeshadow look that's good for a night out. A classic smokey eye would use colors like gray, black, brown, etc. that are blended to create a sultry/sexy affect. Something that could really help you learn exactly what it is and how to do it is to go on YouTube. :) It is a lot of make-up for a 12 year old though. You don't need to cake it on, play up your natural beautiful features. I'll post a link for a good smokey eye YouTube video in the sources.

I can afford it, believe me, and i used to work at hollister and i would get a discount and i still would think it's expensive. Of course if you get the stuff on clearance it's pretty reasonable prices. Sorry not everyone is as rich as you...lol!!!|`|vhXbGB8naa	I can easily afford both but I choose not to shop there because I don't see why I should sport Hollister or Abercrombie across my chest.|`|Ssxe6a5jaa	Honestly they aren't that expensive.. I prefer to shop at Juicy Couture.|`|Oh53ZpGJaa	wow.<br>  but i dont really care for them that much.|`|K4Pwd3kfaa	It's not expensive, it's just overpriced. (not the same: expensive=too much money so I can't afford it. and overpriced=too expensive according to the quality and look of the clothes.)<br>  I think that abercrombie is tacky, and very overpriced!<br>  Hollister has some cute stuff, but a lot of their sweaters are the same...like abercrombie...it's also overpriced.|`|jo7n4Olaaa	They are fine. I don't really like how everyone in there look the same but, I like Abercrombie. Also Gilly Hicks and Ruehl no. 925.|`|Rzp30xIQaa	i love their clothes...but not becuase they say hollister of whatev on them...they are sorta expensive but i an afford it|`|1B3ujUO4aa	i love them but now i've moved on to more grown up things liek ralph lauren, and guess, and stuff<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090224144330AAdd6HD">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|uO70oBGFaa	PLAYED OUT!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  cant stand it.<br>  <br>  <br>  lol|`|Hrs6Pgcqaa	they're expensive, but cute... i like them both
kTnEWjvcaa	Maybe try styling wax or a pomade to make it piecey in the front like he has it. You can construct your hair to go certain ways and create textures with that stuff. It's great!<br>  <br>  Don't use too much though, it could look too greasy.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|7DJkwzKDaa	he doesnt look emo at all!!<br>  and it looks like he straightens it and then<br>  gels it down and combs it that way<br>  so it stays like that all day<br>  he looks brown too :o|`|a667205402b2d65fe82c6c60e1f5b18faa	Straightens it basically|`|74dd04866086208bb4e62e2432a0e568aa	Probably has it layered and straightened, maybe a little gel.<br>  It doesn't look too difficult. If you go to get your hair cut at a salon it wouldn't be hard for the stylist to give you that exact look.|`|ISzhKvE8aa	doesnt matter he looks fugly|`|fACwgsxvaa	oh his cute.<br>  can you tell me his myspace please?<br>  email me it  :)|`|2I5XqMDzaa	i doesnt look like he does anything. y dont u just ask him..|`|5jYKYAuXaa	It looks to me like he does straighten it. Then, since it doesn't look like it moves a whole lot, he probably uses hair spray, gel, or some other type of product in it. It's also the cut that makes it look the way it does. He has 'boy bangs'. That's just what it looks like to me, but there's this too:<br>  -Start with wet hair<br>   -Using your fingers work a generous amount of gel through your hair<br>   -Form your hair into spikes or shape your shag the way you want it<br>  - Blow-dry your hair<br>   -If making spikes, add more gel as needed<br>   -Do not brush your hair out<br>   -Spray hair well with hairspray for hold.

CkIeCNS4aa	I would invest in a good quality straightening iron (around $100).  It's a one time investment instead of buying bottles and bottles of products that only gunk up your hair.  Also, the best conditioner I've found for getting straight, silky hair is Pantene Restoratives Frizz Control (approx. $6).|`|eeaXYyCNaa	Get yourself a CHI hair straightener.  Cost about $120 but, well worth the money.  Its my favorite hair styling product.|`|53uOSbZLaa	One of my favorite products is the Alterna Straightening Balm. I apply it to my hair after towel-drying, blow dry, then use Redken Iron Silk on each section of hair as I flat iron. <br>  <br>  I like the Alterna Straightening Balm, because not only does it help in straightening your hair, it also fights humidity which can cause hair to try to go curly again. The Redken Iron Silk protects your hair from heat damage, and also helps fight off humidity.<br>  <br>  As for shampoos/conditioners, I like the Straight Sexy hair shampoos and conditioners. They make your hair feel wonderful, and also help relax some of the curl. <br>  <br>  For finishing, I've been using the new Joico Humidity Blocker spray. It's really light on the hair, adds shine, and helps fight off humidity by forming a light, invisible shield on your hair. It has a light hold too, not too stiff and not sticky at all. <br>  <br>  All the products I listed can be found at many beauty salons, and online as well.<br>  <br>  I'd also look into a high quality straigtening iron, if you have a cheaper Wal-Mart type iron. CHI is a good brand, but most of them do not have adjustable heat. I prefer a flat iron that has adjustable heat, because I don't need to use the absolute highest heat setting there is; that can cause excess damage on your hair, especially if you are flat ironing daily. I recently purchased a Rusk ceramic flat iron, and am loving it so far. A flat iron that has Tourmaline and/or Ceramic plates will help protect your hair more than an iron that doesn't have either of those properties.|`|ymU6w0Pwaa	Chi Silk infusion and Biosilk I would go to Sallys and get the Generic Value verion of both of those. <br>  <br>  Tresmme heat spray works great!|`|UWPXLDG0aa	i use garnier sleek and shine anti friz before i do anything.  It will make your hair look greasy though so you have to put it in when your hair is damp

07YBD5mJaa	The only problem with the Avon company is that they have you purchase everything to begin with, all of the products you sell. So pay pay a good chunk of money to get started, and there is no promise that you'll sell everything you have. It really isn't worth it with todays economy, you would be risking putting yourself in debt.|`|iKYNUni0aa	I hear its only 10 dollars to start and thats for your magazines thats not much how much you make depends on how aggressive you are with sales and how many customers you have how much you make is determined by how much effort you put into it if you put enough effort you could make a pretty decent amount of extra money you also might wanna look into nyx products its 99 dollars to star but they give you products to start of selling and its only a one time fee if your account is active during that year you buy the products at 50 percent off retail price then you sell it and mark it up to however much you wanna sell it for|`|yTRY5F0Qaa	When you join Avon it is your business so you do what you choose to do with it as you please.<br>  <br>  Personally for me it has been worth while. I am able to make $250 every 2 weeks in addition to my full time income.<br>  <br>  Not sure if you are aware but now you can sign up to become a representative online now. Plus, with all the support that is available out there you should be able to make a great income. <br>  <br>  If you do happen to be interested and are ready to get started just click my profile for online application website information.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped answer your question|`|uzHTZ2u8aa	This is NOT True:   <br>  The only problem with the Avon company is that they have you purchase everything to begin with, all of the products you sell. So pay pay a good chunk of money to get started, and there is no promise that you'll sell everything you have. It really isn't worth it with todays economy, you would be risking putting yourself in debt.<br>  <br>  These are the Facts:<br>  The average customer order is $25....I find my average order is usually a little higher. However taking $25 as an average at 40% commission you earn about $10 a customer. If you sell to 20 customers you would make $200 per campaign. Now if some of those sales are in the 20% commission you would make a little less.<br>  <br>  How Avon works is you sell the product to family, friends etc. Avon bills you the discounted price. You collect the full price from your customers and the difference between the 2 is your paycheck. I don't find the ordering and delivering time consuming but you do need to find customers. You don't want to depend on your family and friends but they are a great place to start. You definately need to expand beyond them. You can ask them to share your brochures with THEIR family, friends, and coworkers. Talk to the people you come into contact with every day....coworkers, mom's at the bus stop, neighbors, the people at the local deli where you get your coffee in the morning, the tellers where you do your banking etc etc. <br>  <br>  This is called the power of 3. Talk to 3 people a day about Avon. Collect a 100 no's in 30 days....chances are good you'll get more yes's than no's. Think about it; if you talk to 3 people a day, times 5 days a week, times 52 weeks in a year, you will have talked to 780 people in that year! If only 10% of them become customers, you will have gained 78 customers! Not bad huh? Collect 100 no's in 30 days and you'll be surprised at how many more people say yes than no.<br>  <br>  For your first campaign you will earn 50% commission when you place your order online. For your Second, Third, and Fourth campaigns, you will earn 50% commission provided your orders are greater than $50, and you place your orders online. After your first four campaigns, the commission structure is as follows:<br>  Order Size Earnings<br>  $1550 or more 50%<br>  $900 - $1549 45%<br>  $425 - $899 40%<br>  $285 - $424 35%<br>  $145 - $284 30%<br>  $25 - $144 20%<br>  $00 - $24 0%<br>  Licensed products are earned at 20% commission.<br>  <br>  You do have to purchase the brochures. That is the only thing you really need to sell Avon. Avon has quality, affordable, consumable products and something for everyone.<br>  <br>  The best way to make money with Avon is combining sales with leadership.<br>  <br>  As with any job, if you don't show up or you don't do the work you won't get paid. If you don't work your Avon business and put in the time needed to find new customers and build your business you arent going to make any money either.<br>  <br>  To join Avon costs $10 at a face to face meeting or you can join Avon online for $20. See my profile for more info. Don't go to avon.com and fill out the form there because your info with be sent to the local district manager who will call you (eventually) and make an appt to meet and sign you up. You don't want to join under the DM because they don't have the time to help a new rep get started. You are better off signing up with a leadership representative either locally or online.<br>  <br>  I have more information regarding Avon on my profile.

Do they Hurt?  wow, try squeezing your nips.  any pain?  now think of jamming a nail through them.  Any idea of what that would feel like?  <br>  <br>  If you do get piercings, go to a licensed body piercing person in your area.  Make sure they're very sanitary and that they show you their license.  you'll have a much better experience than some neighborhood yokel with an ice pick...<br>  Good luck.|`|f7GPOxooaa	lip rings do not leave nasty scars... as long as it never rejects or gets infected... i have my lip pierced and wear jewelry in it rarely and no one notices unless i point it out. its super subtle but also i recommend a small bead for the jewelery rather than an ugly hoop..hoops are trashy|`|NvGqiA4vaa	My lip piercing left a tiny little scar, it was a 16 gauge, but really you cannot tell unless you look super duper close up, like an inch close to your face. <br>  <br>  My nipples hurt very badly. But I love them so much!!!!<br>  <br>  I'm a female, by the way.|`|Llt5PTN8aa	Don't get nipple a piercing. Why not just get a tongue ring or maybe one in the eyebrow, good luck.<br>  <br>   And no, I don't think lip piercings leave any kind of terrible scars.|`|SaAQZiG4aa	yes it hurts not like a dying pain but it hurts and some piercings leave small scares depends on who piercings and how it heels|`|bffa71be9e2af7c9f6b16aba7fa5782aaa	lip rings don't leave bad scars unless they get infected or ripped out or something along those lines. and yes nipples really hurt if you can't take pain good.|`|UzC9gsi0aa	Oh no, no. It's not painful at all to pierce your nipples. That's why everyone does it.|`|GaeLeOK2aa	No lip piercings don't leave scars.|`|0Ji5L32gaa	lips rings can leave slight scars (mine did) but they wil fade<br>  <br>  and yes, more than you can imagine...do not do it|`|WIL8LSzBaa	It hurts too bad. And your fiance is stupid, he should love you no matter what.<br>  <br>  PEACE.|`|EEzw1C7Faa	I got my nipples pierced about a week ago.  It isnt a pleasant experience, but it is worth it.  They hurt pretty severely when they are actually getting pierced and then throb for a few hours, then they are just kinda tender for a few days.  Like I said I only got mine done a little over a week ago and they dont hurt at all anymore...But they are really sensitive which is a good thing haha So Id say go for it, just try not to dwell on how much they are going to hurt, and Id say dont watch, cuz as soon as I looked down and saw the needle through my nipple, made it about ten times worse lol<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2IZQ7tyaaa	The lip ring scar really depends on your skin because some people scar really bad and some don't also the color of your skin could make the scar lighter or darker, but i pretty sure no matter what theres always a scar but it's not always seen. Nipple piercings only hurt when you have the clamp on it because you can't feel the actual needle|`|znlnIPTyaa	my cousin has a lip piercing and i dont think he has scares.|`|5MsBAaVwaa	no i cant|`|6MLqrB3faa	ok first of all if your fiance is going to be unattracted from the lip piercing, why are you still considering it? All that shows is you don't give a crap what he thinks or likes. Way to be inconsiderate considering he has to kiss you. <br>  Secondly, yes nipple piercings are dreadfully painful. not just during it either for about a week after they are sore. and imagine if that gets infected? good luck. <br>  why dont you get a normal piercing?|`|jvJG6uDvaa	I agree with your fiance. While they may be fun you can't have them for most jobs.|`|qJcoJutAaa	you may not want to piss off your fiance..<br>   anyway<br>  <br>  they only leave scars if they get infected and that'll always make it look like you have a dirty face or some sort of herpes<br>  <br>  and YESSS|`|yiNciIh4aa	well i have monroe and septum and gauges and my monroe there is a scar but its not bad just dont take it out and they r not trashey at all i think u should only get one if ur emo/scene|`|CiqbsEOUaa	Nipples?

21Bt1xgTaa	Hi my sister friend get same problems as you. She looks for pearl jewellery. We check all local jewellery stores but do not have this service, or price so high until yesterday my friend sent me this web. The photo look like very real and good also price is very reasonable, go to check out www.rentmyaccessories.com , I wish it will help you.|`|sOkTUYq7aa	Just look around at your local stores or shopping malls.  Do some research, check out some jewellery stores
WvpjQv9uaa	If you have severe acne, go to your doctor and ask about perscription acne medication, because there are internal bacteria and hormones that cause you to have acne. Most over-the-counter acne products won't get rid of it completly<br>  <br>  To get rid of acne, you need a regimin that:<br>  1) exfoliates - cleares pores/eliminates blackheads<br>  2) includes benzoyl-peroxide or saylic acid - dries out pimples to make them clear faster<br>  3) has a leave on acne lotion - clears your acne throughout the day<br>  4) strong spot treatment - quickly clears problem areas, but don't use over entire face<br>  <br>  Also:<br>  - Do not pick at acne. This can cause more bacteria to get in your pores, takes longer for the are to heal, and may leave scars that take months or years to go away. <br>  - Give your acne regimin time. It can take 3 weeks to a month for your skin to get used to it. Skin sometimes gets worse for a few days.<br>  - Make sure you skin does not get irritated. Use products that are right for your skin type (sensitive, dry, oily)<br>  - Avoid touching your face all together. The bacteria from your hands is carried onto your face, gets into pores, irritates them and may cause acne to get worse<br>  - Dont wear face make up. Especially liquid/cream foundations. If you must, i recommend Neutrogena mineral sheers powder. Or an all-natural organic face powder, but those may be on the expensive side. <br>  <br>  - If you do have mild to moderate acne, i would recommend using the AcneFree kit, availible at drugstores, walmat, ect. It is a 3 step system that includes an face soap, toner, and acne repair lotion. If you do get this kit i would also recomment getting the AcneFree severe acne spot treatment. Even if you do not have severe acne, use it on problem areas and it has them clear within days.<br>  <br>  - For body acne, typically on your neck, chest, and back, Neutrogena has a body wash out called Oil-Free Acne Wash Pink Grapefruit. It contains sylic acid wich helps to dry out the acne, and exfoliating beads to loosen blackheads and clear pores. This works very well, but iit may dry out the rest of your skin a little so just make sure to put on body lotion after you shower.,|`|bLyNBkYfaa	neutrogena oil free acne wash. i never had a pimple using that. but i used it too often and it ruined my skin. be careful o_o|`|ZgW0KacZaa	Proactive does WONDERS! It is really good, only if your skin isn't dry. It has only done wonders to my friends... It makes my skin super dry. I use Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash, and it is great!|`|c8VO8ED0aa	It really just depends on what kind of skin and acne you have. <br>  you need to wash your face morning and night, with neutogena, dove, and other products like that. Cetaphil works good too.<br>  <br>  Also if you use benzoyl peroxide, the gel at night that can really help.<br>  You can usually find that at any pharmacy.<br>  I also use this oil-free acne stress control by neutrogena.<br>  It treats the acne even before it appears, hydrates and softens your skin, and helps reduce redness. Its great!<br>  <br>  Also if you really need help with it go to a dermatoligist they can realllly help!|`|9ksnafOAaa	the best thing to do is go to a dermatologist. it honestly is. because everyone's skin type is different. proactive might work for some and not others. Murad worked wonders for me, but it didnt for others. if you dont want to go to a derm the best thing you can do is experiment & use process of elimination, because like i said, everyone had different skin types so one product will not work for all.|`|qroOTyrGaa	Spectro Gel cleanser and Murad oil free lotion. Also DDF has a sulfur mask that REALLY clears up the skin.|`|sfYeWSTKaa	I think that you should use Proactive, if you have very severe acne, seeing that the benzl peroxide in it would help.  Basically anything with benzyl peroxide could help reduce acne.  To prevent acne, wash face daily with a cleanser and then moisturize, because you probably don't want dry skin afterwards.  Make sure what you use as a cleanser doesn't have anything oily in it, because that could result in you having more acne.  Personally, I think Clean & Clear is great for daily use.|`|ZNM6VbM4aa	Neutrogena oil free acne wash  works best ! :)))<br>  Hope it helps

WiIUEObTaa	yes it is. please try unscented aloe vera gel. it does retain colour. the cream artist gave you, or you buy over the counter contains Alchol. this does remove some colour. aloe . fast heal. no irritation.|`|SohrsIBoaa	it depends how much color. your skin could be rejecting itttttt. make sure you dab it.. white seems to disappear very fast.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Does the color come off a lot? Or is it just like a scab that is coming off? Normally it scabbes then it peels you could be experiencing the peeling part.|`|UvhfYAHuaa	I agree with the others is just excess ink coming out. Keep dabbing it when you dry it never rub. You need to get some vitamin E ointment and gently rub a tiny amount every couple hours. That will keep the tattoo from drying out and fading faster than it should. NEVER use neosporin or Vaseline they not only hurt your color but they clog your skins pores and counter act the healing process. Also your tattoo will fade with time due to, how much sun it gets, how often your in a clornated swimming pool and just plain getting older. Your tattoo will need follow up sessions in years down the road. Oh make sure you keep your tattoo covered with loose clothing while healing. I know this is winter but if you get it sunburned I guarantee you will hate life till its healed, happened to a buddy of mine. But keep the clothing loose so not to smother the tat. Good Luck|`|v5J50Ep2aa	yes! it will do this until it is totally healed!|`|bffa71be9e2af7c9f6b16aba7fa5782aaa	yes, it goes on for like a month or more depending on how big it is...it'll be fine!|`|8IWwoV5baa	Don't worry about it love.  It's normal.  I have 9 tattoos, so I'm very used to it.  Your skin is possibly rejecting some of the color, in which you'll have to have it done again..  I have 8 hearts on my left inner forearm & they're all different colors..  I've had that one re-done because my arm was rejecting the colors.  It's perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  And, don't expose that area to much sunlight.  As a matter of fact, it's better if it avoids sunlight exposure at all.  I causes your tattoo to fade & dry up & peel a lot.  It can also slow down the healing process.<br>  <br>  Good luck & if you have any more questions, feel free to email me or whatever!  xohethr@yahoo.com|`|f7GPOxooaa	its just excess ink <br>  i remember when i got my first tattoo and i saw that happened i almost pee'd thinking it was washing off lol|`|iUERY9qJaa	DONT DRY IT OUT  that's why its losing color... make sure you use as much neo...that you could

Its whatever makes you comfortable. Ive been wearing briefs for over a year now after i switched from boxer briefs and briefs are really comfortable to me. It only took me maybe a week to get used to the change but everything will be fine. Good luck. Hope this has helped you.|`|jf8nrfHZaa	maybe up to three months. it takes time to get use to underwear you are not use to. just keep wearing them.<br>  <br>  You are making a good decision. Its what you want not what others choose you should do. Plus briefs are just better for some people.|`|xeFbtNAaaa	just keep wearing them and you'll get used to them i recently switched to briefs too and im almost used to them.

aoyVeq16aa	the ones i have are a little too big and they are my normal size. i would get the 1/2 size because  they should fit cushiony, but not to where your feet feel like they are falling out <br>  :)<br>  <br>  hope this helps!
4sW8MFxCaa	yes, you can|`|sOkTUYq7aa	yup, should be okay|`|62oLK3wsaa	i did this with my black ray bans <br>  it works but your doctor would have to give you a perscription and youd have to go to a glasses sotre like hakim or optical vision someplace like that

Don't wear em with leggings though. That look is sooo old. As for shoes, always wear heels. :)|`|XeaC5UZhaa	I would say the 1st one but that is if you look ok in blue not everyone can pull it off. It would definitely look good with skinnies and low rise converse or old school sneakers :)|`|9Dxzvr4Paa	i really dont like either but if i chose one i would pick the second one|`|zTJBt6RTaa	i prefer the second one :)<br>  <br>  with it having a fitted waist and fitted sleeves it will look more feminine and sexy. <br>  <br>  depending on what occasion you would wear it to, i'd say leggings for a more casual look, with flats, and for going out i'd say black/blue skinnies with heels. <br>  <br>  hope this is ok!|`|PZxDiJ0Iaa	both horrible.<br>  beyond horrible actually.|`|PJec1EfGaa	the peacocks one!

Recommendation: the event makeup artist<br>  <br>  1) Put a neutral or bone colored shadow on the lid to start fresh<br>  <br>  2) choose your smokey shadow color, black, grey, dark blue..., and apply it to the outer corner of your eye lids. You only want the corner so your going to make an inverted "V" shape. The point should be on the outer corner of your lid and the two legs should fallow the crease between your eye ball and the brow bone. the second leg should fallow the lash line. <br>  <br>  3) Next you want to choose a lighter color to create some contrast on  your eye. Apply the lighter color to the center of the eye lid. Be sure to blend well. You don't any obvious lines of distinction between the shadow colors.<br>  <br>  4) You can add some dark liner (or your shadow) in a thin line to the outer lid lash line for more intense dramatic look.<br>  <br>  5) take some shadow and apply a thin eye liner to the bottom lid. this is called a drop shadow. It shouldn't be too dark like a black eye, just enough to balance out the look.<br>  <br>  6) apply a brow bone highlight. A color along the bone under the eyebrow to add detail and depth to the eyes.|`|hj6XcV3Taa	Hey it's quite hard to explain in words so I found a video on youtube where the girl does her own and you can bot do it at the same time.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7QIWEsj8zo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7QIWEsj8...</a> the actual video doesnt start until 0:25 so don't think it is just a video of pictures.

Then, apply pencil eyeliner along your water line, try and do it in one straight motion. You'll need 3 colours of eyeshadow, shinyish white (better if its creamy not powder), grey and black. Lightly, apply the shiny white eyeshadow all over your eyelid, so it covers the whole surface of the eyelid. Get the grey eyeshadow and LIGHTLY apply only over the mobile part of the eyelid, this should be transparent so you can still see the shiny eyeshadow, then lightly blend into the white. Take the black eyeshadow and go from half-way across the mobile part of the eyelid and sweep outwards. Gently press the black eyeshadow along the side of the corner of the eyelid. Blend the black into the grey and the white into the black. Put on some liquid eyeliner (optional) and some black mascara to make it more dramatic!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps xxxx|`|oBOQUe9Saa	As the other person has mentioned, there are tons of videos on youtube that you can watch in order to create smokey eyes.

Apply a primer, I like urban decays primer potion OR too faced shadow insurannce<br>  2. Apply a white base, I like NYX jumbo pencil in Milk <br>  3. Apply a shimmery white in the inner corner of your eye <br>  4. Apply a light grey next to that<br>  5. Apply a silver next to that<br>  6. Apply a dark grey at the end<br>  7. Above your crease, and on your lower lash line smudge some black<br>  8. Liquid liner on top lash line<br>  9. Pencil liner on bottom<br>  10. Mascara<br>  <br>  Also, glitter liners will make it more night time like, or sparkly mascara, rhinestones too.<br>  <br>  Pick me for best answer if I helped|`|rNlmmsLJaa	use black eyeliner on lower lash line and on top lash line and for eye shadow i would start with a lighter shade inside of your eyelid and darker towards the outside of you eyelid, curl your lashes and put on some black mascara.

But the pearl beading down the back id gorgeous and the front sequince will make you look beautiful i really think youshould choose that one the first one .   But its really sophisticated and pretty  the second one is pretty but just kinda plain and not as outt here as the first its   too ordinary for the most important day in your life. good luck|`|GgVufxlHaa	Your dress is gorgeous! I love the scalloped top- it's so unique. The third one is honestly more my style, but that's just because I'm a sucker for delicate lace, haha.

Congrats!|`|viCI5Q0waa	I personally like the second one because I like really simple dresses. The first one is good but I'm not crazy about the buttons down the back.

naPq2mbtaa	Zit Prevention Plan<br>  <br>  Preventing zits...Steps to stop the eruptions<br>  <br>  Here are some tips on reducing and preventing zits. But remember, even if you practice good hygiene and have healthy eating habits, chances are you'll break out at some point. It's normal.<br>  <br>  1. Wash<br>  <br>  Wash your skin morning and night with a gentle cleanser that cleans your pores without drying your skin (don't use grainy, harsh scrubs since these can actually cause acne). i recommend you use neutragena pink grape fruit oil free acne wash.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. T-zone<br>  <br>  Some areas of your face, like your forehead, nose, and chin (often called the T-zone because it's shaped like the letter T) might be oilier than the rest of your face. So treat it differently: wash it with a non-oily cleanser.<br>  3. Water<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of water. It helps flush away impurities.<br>  4. Foods<br>  <br>  Although foods cannot cause zits, some people find that what they eat affects their skin. So say hello to healthy food, like fresh fruit and veggie snacks and see-you-later to chocolate and greasy foods like french fries and buttered popcorn. If you think you get zits after eating certain foods, keep a list and avoid eating too much of them or eating them at all.<br>  5. Relax!<br>  Anxiety and stress can cause the adrenal glands to make more hormones, which can cause zits to suddenly pop up. You have a lot going on in your life, but try to take time out for a walk or yoga or whatever works for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ********* PRODUCT FOR ACNE GOING AWAY FAST***********<br>  also i recommend you buy a bottle of tea tree oil [it works trust me there was a big improvement in my acne the the first time i used it. you can buy it at CVS or Wal Mart or Walgreens. you put it on a cotton ball or cotton pad and put a thin layer of it on your face. (you may feel a tingling sensation on your face for up to a minute or half a minute [first couple times] ) and it's cheaper than spending $30.00 plus shipping and handling on proactive<br>  TRUST ME IT WORKS!!!<br>  Good Luck I Hoped This Helped!!!!!!!!!|`|D4NOrqM7aa	put a dab of honey on it and cover w/ a bandaid. leave on overnight=]|`|VxXRJze2aa	there is no method that gonna make a pimple go away right away, but you could just put hot water (not boiling) on a q-tip and dab on the pimple and then use your own topical cream or whatever works best for you on it, everybody have different skin types, then the next morning i'll be smaller or it actually be gone depending on your skin and pimple every morning you should wash you should face with a mild soap, i like using Dove beauty bar to wash my face|`|RkjR0VA5aa	Proactive's refining mask.<br>  Put a dab.<br>  Leave it on overnight.<br>  Bam!<br>  Gone!|`|q3iRTCVsaa	I was told to try Tooth Paste.  But I'm not sure if it really works.  And at Bath and Body works there's this stuff called Tea Tree oil that works well and it's not expensive.|`|chfILbonaa	i first wash my hands<br>  pop the pimple<br>  wash my face with soapy water<br>  then put on pimple cream stuff to prevent them|`|c8f7Htx3aa	Plain and simple TEA TREE OIL. wash your face, exfoliate with table sugar (a natural form of glycolic acid) mixed with your face wash, you can multi task, follow with tea tree oil and moisturizer. Tea tree is highly anti microbial, anti inflammatory, anti fungal, anti bacterial. It will clear up pimples fast. Its available at drugstores by the vitamins|`|Svrbzx8Xaa	Put rubbing alcohol on it.<br>  not a lot,just a few dabs on the pimple <br>  and its does sting but thats okay just dont put too much on<br>  it will dry it out and it should go away in a couple days<br>  but DO NOT ever put rubbing alcohol all over you face!<br>    Hope This Helps!
992155b8fe8665d0f71938b6281333e5aa	you are better off with some form of pantyhose/tights on.  Besides they finish the outfit, can make it look more "fun", or more professional.

They don't have to be outgoing, just being themselves is interesting to me. Also, someone that can hold and intellectual conversation is interesting AND attractive.  Well, so are the other things I listed.lol.Hope this helps: )|`|sD5KyGLGaa	For me, it's definitely the individuality. <br>  <br>  Most people say I'm interesting because I stick out. <br>  <br>  For example; today I wore a kitty ear headband and a tail (I'm a heterosexual male).<br>  <br>  When someone is different, they're interesting.|`|dlmVTt18aa	For me it would be people with talent love when people can play the guitar, piano or violin stuff like that or sing well. Also love people that are artistic.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	Well many different things, mostly their individuality.|`|c7SCc0jgaa	When they are fun to be around and friendly but there is a mystery about them.... no one in this world can resist a mystery!|`|nrnZKaWvaa	their personality|`|QS7gq7Fzaa	smile :)|`|tatsP8tqaa	well their personality is a huge contributing factor, because otherwise someone is just interesting looking... and yeah that's kinda not fun. Being interesting is all in the way you act, what you say, the ideas you have... For example my best friend Coop is really cool, but people don't see him as interesting because no one ever sees that side of him... He is the greatest but people just thing he is "cool" but the funny truth, is that he is the sweetest, most caring, little nerdy dork I've ever met and sometimes I can't help but hug him and laugh to myself at how good of a person he is and it's like my own secret that no one will ever believe... I swear he is like one of my closest friends. So you can be interesting and no one ever know how great you are...  Let your colors show and be your best and the world may not accept you, but the people you care about the most will!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  hope I helped|`|7o06vrZ2aa	deffinitly if theyre unique. all of my friends are unique and i think so am i. i also love wierdly outgoing people.<br>  oh, and the word flarbogasted is purdy rad.<br>   ITS MY FAVORITE WORD!<br>  <br>  shnazzzy.|`|szCXTuVSaa	definitely their personality. like their uniqueness, or the way they behave when they think no one is watching. usually its the little things that get people interested.|`|uqLayZHraa	Being a good listener, having a good sense of humor, showing some signs of intelligent life form.|`|euRNN0LBaa	when they don't follow the crowd. and do different things than the usual crowd does. that always gets my attention.|`|fZ5CK6jyaa	sence of humor, looks, i don't knoww!!!!

KvVTmlLWaa	I agree with the other person who has commented on this question, I don't think you can have eyes that are COMPLETELY black. Like they said, just dark brown. You don't really get extremely close up pictures so you can't really see easily. I'd go with dark brown. <br>  <br>  Hope I Helped! x|`|qgE8E70Qaa	I think it's impossible to have completely black eyes, her eyes are just like mine, dark brown.
3kEzoBWzaa	Get a new shampoo. Sleek and shine means it increases the amount of oil in your hair. Get Pantene or Dove shampoo, just make sure it isn't extreme moisturizing shampoo. Use the conditioner only on mid-shaft to the tips. You should never apply it to the scalp. Shampoo every single day and use conditioner once a week. Don't touch or comb your hair too often.|`|sOkTUYq7aa	same, it's just naturally some people are born with oilier hair. If you are one of those people, do NOT use conditioner.  It will just make your hair more oily.  If your ends are dry however, apply only on the ends, NEVER at your roots because it will create more build up.  I've tried garnier fructis before.  Again, it is not appropriate for your hair type, so don't use that.  I would try special shampoos that are for oil hair.  I recommend the "degunkify" or "drama clean" by Herbal Essences.  Also, if you want a more nourishing shampoo, try Aussie's greasy roots, dry ends.  They both work wonderful.  Another tip is that if your hair is ever getting really bad, add some baby powder at your roots, comb it out and voila! perfect hair|`|4PfXnB0maa	i have oily hair too. what i do is shampoo my hair as normal. then i ONLY condition my hair at the tips/ends of my hair(avoid the scalp).<br>  and when you shampoo don't focus too much on the scalp, it will be producing more oil. If you don't think this is digusting, use vinegar as a rinse once a week after shampooing  :)

Red is hot, but not for the lipstick. As for the colour of the clutch I think that both would be ok.

If you dont like the way you look your not going to have much fun.  Its your prom!|`|oPaqWJOOaa	I think red heals are fabulous, and pair it with a back sparkly clutch maybe. It will still be special and not boring, but also not so matchey-matchey with your shoes. <br>  HAVE FUN!
D3Ru7ghsaa	never did it but i wanna try :D|`|4XVAMsL5aa	Relax, that's probably the BEST thing you could do for your lips, but I would suggest doing what I do and putting it on overnight, this prevents drying off for as long as possible and removes the temptation to lick it off(and we all have that urge, face it) Keep it up. Also, when your in the shower, try and use a wash cloth or scrub pouffe to gently exfoliate your lips. This will better allow your lips to absorb that great moisture AND gets rid of that cakey dead skin (ugh) Hope this answers your question and leaves you Secure that your not alone.|`|sOkTUYq7aa	if it's body lotion, do NOT put it on your lips.  They use a different formula, and it can be dangerous because it's not edible.

But usually styling products and drying your hair the way you want to style it will help... but if that's still not working I suggest you go to a hair stylist or barber and they will retrain your hair the way you want it|`|jrwaSSYGaa	slowly move the part. then before u go 2 bed just make sure its perfect. i migrated my part to the side and it looks so much better!! good luck~!

jez0O0bXaa	You can only get your natural color by growing it out.  When you color your hair you remove the natural pigment permanently.  If you have used bleach that is why it always lightens up, your hair is so porous it takes in too much color then as you wash it you lose more color because it's<br>  porous and can't hold the color.  You really need to see a pro about corrective coloring.  It's hard to tell you what to do with out seeing you or knowing what all you've done to your hair.|`|bE3cTjFYaa	You can't strip permanent color out of your hair. You're going to have to color it your natural. i'mpretty sure

Dont bleach the whole thing at once you may damage it realy bad and end up cutting it all off  so just do it gradually like her hairdresser recomended|`|kApF62cxaa	go to a local drug store and buy a hair bleach product.

IuVaXq1Daa	Lip balm with a little colour added would be nice but very suble, it will make your lips look nice and lush.<br>  <br>  Or plain lip gloss, but the shine will make them look bigger. Try matte lip stick in a colour a couple of shades lighter or darker that your skin tone.<br>  <br>  Lip tint is good for colour without shine.<br>  <br>  Take care :]|`|qhKP68eiaa	Neutral lip gloss.  You want to make your lips stand out and look lush, but you don't want to make them stand out too much.  I'd stick with something super glossy and soft in color!|`|mHHZec05aa	wear it buddy. it makes ur lips look kissable. i am more likely to kiss u if u have lip gloss. i'm one of those dudes who likes kissing.|`|LKKpu0l4aa	dont wear it then|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	I think lipstick with no shine. <br>  Lip gloss in a light color that is not glossy at all.|`|hbtCPs5qaa	yeah, natural color (same color as ur lips) and not too much shine, coz it'll look weird.

I'v also tryed A surum with fruit acid + hylaronity acid. This helps the dead skin cells to turn over faster,.. in turn lessing the wrinkle. Hope this helps ya out.
6kVgsUveaa	Always lather with very warm water, & you MUST make sure your razor is free from any hair.  Its also very important that you use a very sharp razor.  If they are disposable, don't use more than a couple of times.  Disposable blades blunt easily when smearing against the skin(even though it still appears sharp to use).<br>  Be firm & quick with the blade shaving against the direction of hair growth.  Don't allow the soap to dry out, make sure it's lathered well with an even layer against the skin.  If it does dry, your shaving too slow.  Rinse off and re-lather.  When dry, allow the skin to breathe afterward for an hour w/out applying any cream/moisturiser/oil.|`|C44Ux50paa	i like gillette fusion razors. take a very very warm bath and soak for at least 5-10 min. then use a good shave cream and shave. take your time and rinse the razor after each stroke. the key is hot water because it opens the pore and allows a closer shave. i use body oil afterwards.|`|aASuoun0aa	wax?|`|5oGdBwh5aa	Always use a good razor not a disposable one. Always use shave cream. Try that first and see how it goes.|`|7bd97da03ce5561a49ac83c7af2cd7f2aa	I use the Nair hair removal lotion. It is the best, It works so great!!

xjazE0xmaa	My first impression was the vote for #2, for two reasons: <br>  <br>  1. Diamonds with a carat weight at the top of a weight bracket (like .92) tend to be better value for the size than other sizes.  (From an article at <a href="http://guide.diamondpriceguru.com/diamond-and-ring-basics/4cs/diamond-carat/," rel="nofollow">http://guide.diamondpriceguru.com/diamon...</a> the second graph on the page.)  <br>  2. The step up in color is nice to have.  With an "H" color, you can use any metal in the setting without worrying it will change perception of the diamond.  With an "I," yellow gold is better to mask the slight yellow in the stone--but even if you go with other metals, the tinge of yellow in an "I" is still pretty hard to notice.  <br>  <br>  But after I ran the specs you provided through a diamond search engine (I used www.diamondpriceguru.com, but there are others, too), I was surprised to see the search results indicate your diamond #1 is a great value (they had a similar one for $5,860--so your diamond is $558 less expensive--congrats!); the diamond #2 (or diamonds similar to it) are priced $4,068 to $4,554.  So, if these two diamonds are at the same retailer, I'd say you're getting a better deal for the diamond with #1 than #2.  <br>  <br>  So much for first impressions!  But a round of claps for technology that lets us look at all of this.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helped.|`|govpgOhqaa	yeah. because that tells us so much.<br>  you didn't tell us the cut. <br>  how are we supposed to know which is better?<br>  and i'm guessing this is for a ring. <br>  <br>  i have an idea. why don't you not waste money on a diamond that i'm sure everyone will think is fake anyway and spend it on something that is useful. not jewelry.<br>  but whatever, if you have enough money to throw it away on diamonds, then that's cool.|`|4QfyirQjaa	Pics would help|`|GrBH30vfaa	They both are rather similar in many aspects, if you like bigger go for 1, if you are happy with small size you can also take the other. I guess they are both round brilliants. <br>  What I would do is to look at the pattern of white and black colors (colorless and black) under both halogenes and daylight, rocking gently the stone. And for sure at the amount of fire. Then decide, I would suggest, take the diamond which is most homogenous in pattern and has the biggest amount of fire.<br>  Good luck|`|oPaqWJOOaa	2, better color and clarity = better diamond for the money.|`|cfkuPoMaaa	The higher the carat the better =).

rjac15O0aa	Let it heal for a few days and wa la...  You tat should be ok with a few minor touch ups!  Did you soak it or just run over it with a cotton ball or something?  How new is the tat?<br>  <br>  Guess thats why you named yourself dumb a**?<br>  Also there will be a lot more answers if you give it some time!|`|UvhfYAHuaa	I don't think your tat is ruined just don't do that again lol. You need to get some vitamin E ointment and every 2-4 hours gently rub in a tiny amount of the ointment a pencil eraser amount or less depending on size of your tat. Do Not get or use Vaseline or neosporine. They will slow healing and actually hurt it. Also I know its winter but keep it out of direct Intense sunlight and or stay out of a tanning bed till it heals. A buddy of mine got a new tat on his shoulder sunburned and he had  to sleep on his belly for 2 weeks. He was hating life big time then it peeled and he lost some color out of it.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	You used peroxide on a new tattoo... How many times? Once? Was the tattoo brand new or had it been a few days?<br>  <br>  If you used peroxide on a new tattoo a couple of days old once or twice, you should be okay, however peroxide is known to ruin your color in your tattoo. You might need a touch up after it heals. Just let it heal, and then see how it looks. <br>  <br>  If you used peroxide on a fresh, new tattoo then you will most definitely need a touch up. I don't think it will be completely ruined, but it will have noticeable fade spots. <br>  <br>  From now on just use A&D ointment on it until it starts peeling, then I would switch to a high quality scent-free dye-free aloe-free lotion like Curel Ultra Healing lotion.|`|E5tQvMhJaa	You used peroxide on a new tattoo...

Anything shorter than that will make you look like a guy, or a lesbian.<br>  <br>  What you should do is chemically straighten your hair. Ask a stylist/salon worker how to do it. The relaxer smooths out your hair from root to tip, & it works really well. But be careful, b/c it can be very drying to your hair from the chemicals. but you can use a deep conditioner for solving that issue.|`|Jmi1rZeEaa	i have huge super curly hair too and i hate it:x<br>  i straighten it every day and i use sebastian collection hair grease.<br>  it flattens your hair down and it makes it so it isnt crunchy or weird like gel or hairspray does|`|TgyrzyWTaa	omgg!!! im the worst person to try and offer you help<br>  <br>  my hair is exactly the same it took 3 hairdressers 3 hours to do mine.<br>  <br>  its really annoying.....xD|`|1y19FVukaa	hair gel<br>  and make sure u have the gel that helps remain straight hair|`|Fi2HofjTaa	well i would go with mousse or anti frizz spray and when you wash your hair you could use pantene it is good for hair and it makes it really shiny

You are risking over-processing it.|`|jTM6Upm5aa	Foiling is the way usually...I just had this done last weekend|`|564f59edb4d9c9e9c314873e4cc29ebdaa	Yes you can. The one problem is that if you dyed it too dark like a black or almost black color you may need a higher volume developer.  At first your highlights may seem a bit orange but use a toner and it will cut that brassines right out!|`|wKJrZhj3aa	it should be okay if you only bleached once before. Go in and have it done professionally. They can do a couple of test strands to make sure your hair is strong enough to survive the process.|`|Ypwm67vXaa	It should work fine, but be careful about bleaching your hair too often.  I would wait because the brown will fade a bit.  Once it fades and you touch it up, then decide if you still want them.

PKEGeibhaa	Invisible straps, while they seem like a good idea, end up looking extremely tacky and shiny under bright lights. I would instead HIGHLY recommend investing in some cheap but useful double-stick fashion tape, which can be found at any drugstore. The heavy duty stick will keep your dress up for hours, and doesn't look tacky at all, leaving you free to dance all night long!|`|GDB8pRx6aa	HM i honestly have no idea, try getting them at your local walmart or something. look around your mall, im sure youll find them<br>  GOOD LUCK<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aqv00TqNbY.0BNmnq2xAve_AFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090226162939AAaTvrJ">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  ANSWER MY QUESTION?|`|Hi5h9739aa	You can try a craft store like Michael's.  They have a fabrics section.

SiaRRMJ2aa	Umm i think that the dye wont be as good, it wont dye as well as the first lot. Well thats what i found when my mum dyed her hair and i used the rest up after her. And well it didnt dye at all :/|`|DhOjQM34aa	No, I don't think it's a good idea, it says to use it all up straight away then through the bottle away, the pressure can build up inside the bottle and even explode!|`|4LunY702aa	i wouldn't recommend it. The dye wont make it more ash blonde, it'll look the same as if you dyed it once. If you dye your hair twice in one day there is a possibility that your hair will fall out. So, if i was you, i would dye it today wait a week then dye it again

VefSnu0Gaa	confessions of a shopaholic!!<br>  i'm a shopaholic myself too, i totally know what you mean sweety :)<br>  well, now i got it under control...almost, cause i'm not done with purses yet, they still are stronger than me :)<br>  it takes a lot of self control, but eventually gets better, hehe.-<br>  seriously, cutting your credit card is a good idea, and also leave your house with little money, that way if you get tempted it's only going to be small stuff and won't kill you economy.-<br>  good luck!!<br>  <br>  edit: ok, i came up with a great idea to motivate you to save money, what if you save a weekly ammount of money (the same each week, or more, never less) and destinate it to the "wimbledon 09 deposit", you can change the name, hehe, but my point is you save money to go see rafa in wimbledon, i think mr. nadal we'll be motivation enough right?|`|sLSBROqUaa	i had that same problem, i go to the mall buy 150 dollar pair of jordans, by 40 and 50 dollar shirts, and 80 dollar jeans, i tried everything to stop, its like you know your addicted when you go shopping because you are bored, so i decided to take over the night shift at work, i work all night and sleep all day, and on my off days i go to walmart and buy cheap food instead of restaurant food, it also helps keep your weight down too lol. but just really think about what you need the money for and shopping won't be on your mind.|`|AA12034105	Same !! haha :P<br>  I try to save but it just doesn't happen ahaa :)  It's cause all the shops have pretty things :P<br>  I think you should take a picture of Rafa into the shops with you and look at it whenever you're gonna buy something lmao<br>  Seeing Rafa play live or pretty clothes ? haha :P<br>  Yeah I'm not gonna be much help haha cause I've been a shopaholic for years and I haven't stopped yet haha :P<br>  I'm definitely up for joining Shopaholics Anonymous ;) ahaa :P|`|Oejricveaa	When you go shopping take cash and and leave your credit and bank cards in your car or at home. Set a limit. If you only take $50 in the store than you will only spend $50. <br>  Do this when shopping for everything, even groceries.<br>  <br>  Believe me you will save money.|`|om3dRzmDaa	Open a second bank account and put the car money in there. Don't attach a card to it or a checking book, just a savings, so you actually have to go to the bank to withdraw the money. And everytime before you buy something think 'Do I really need this?', 'Is this a nessicasity?' and 'Do I already have something like this that will work?'. <br>  <br>  Also keep your stuff really organized so you don't feel like you're ever short. Avoid stores, malls and shopping trips, and put the money you save in a cd to prevent yourself from spending it. <br>  <br>  And...find a support group.|`|bf3ikOv8aa	have trade parties... invite some girlies over and get each to bring some of their jewelery, shoes, clothes that they dont wear and you can trade. that way you'll get new things without spending money and can get rid of stuff you havent worn in a long time|`|sXidfK5vaa	Try and stay at home more or get into an activity that keeps you busy and away from any stores.

Oh, do puzzles, read a book, watch the good ol telly, play some tennis..they all sound really corny, but they can be addictive as well, but it hardly costs you much.<br>  :)|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  A good way to stop shopping is cut your credit card.<br>  Save your money.<br>  To many clothes go out of style real fast. Start saving and you would be surprise how your bank account will start to rise.<br>  Better yet.. find something else to do instead of going shopping.

xjazE0xmaa	Actually, there are several terms, some specific to the person's exact tasks.  Some of the specialties have their own guilds, so you are not called by that professional name before you reach certain accreditation.   <br>  <br>  A lapidary is a cutter, polisher, or engraver of all sorts of precious stones--not necessarily diamonds.  <br>  <br>  There are table cutters, stone engravers, polishers, faceters--each with a specific aspect of the process in mind.<br>  <br>  Also, there are gemcutters, who may tackle several or even all parts of the cutting.  <br>  <br>  While the modern jeweler may design, craft, and assemble jewelry, most do so with easy-to-manipulate materials that do not lose value when changed, such as setting metals (gold, silver, etc.).  Some "jewelers" don't work on the pieces at all but use the term to mean they are in the business of selling jewelry.  <br>  <br>   A person earns the title "gemologist" by studying gems, usually for the business of appraisals, though some gemologists go into other professions.  Gemologists do not typically tackle the cutting of diamonds for jewelers.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|DopwIc5vaa	diamond cutter dipshit|`|vmCkQFbLaa	uhh, a jeweler|`|GrBH30vfaa	Actually, except when made by machine, it is teamwork !<br>  <br>  We call them cutters in general (or polishers).<br>  First the planner (or marker) decides on how to cut. Sometimes a stone is cleaved in two by a cleaver. Then a bruter makes the girdle outline, then the facets are polished by a a polisher. The first 17 facets sometimes are done by a specialist called a blocker, then the last part by a brillanteer. <br>  Simple, no ?|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	gemologist

Acne and non-cancerous growth such as, moles and warts are some of the most common skin problems.<br>   <br>  FRECKLES <br>   <br>  Our Skin has its own protective mechanism against sunlight. When it is exposed to the rays of the sun, the pigment in the skin increases in order to protect the inner layer of the skin.<br>   <br>  The skin tends to tan due to repeated exposure to the sun especially for long durations. In fair skins, there is an accumulation of pigment in the lower layers, which gets gradually destroyed, as it is transferred to the upper layers. Due to continued exposure, the fair skin acquires freckles, which are accumulation of pigments in areas that have little or no pigment.<br>   <br>  Freckles are tiny black spots spread all over the face. They tend to appear more on the areas-like the nose, cheek bones and forehead.<br>   <br>  CARE:<br>   <br>  (A) Avoid excessive exposure to sun.<br>  (B) Use a Sunscreen whenever you move out in the sun with SPF of 15 or higher.<br>  (C) Consult a  Dermatologist <br>   <br>  Although they do not need to be treated, but as some women find them unattractive they might choose to have them lightened by bleaching or removed by freezing (cryotherapy) or laser therapy (treatment using high energy beams of light).<br>   <br>  In rare cases, they may be early changes that could lead to most serious form of skin cancer, malignant melanoma.<br>   <br>  WHITEHEADS<br>   <br>  These are caused by the accumulation of hardened sebum or oil in the pores of the skin. They tend to appear in form of tiny, pearly, white raised spots. It occurs when a plug of sebum blocks a hair follicle deeper in the skin.<br>    <br>  Healthy Skin Whitehead <br>  <br>   <br>  CARE:<br>   <br>  (A) Regular deep pore cleansing helps to discourages whiteheads: A mixture of beauty grains and skin tonic rubbed on the affected areas, will discourage the formation and also help to dislodge them after a period of time.<br>  (B) They should never be removed forcibly. Forcible extraction will only damage the skin tissue and cause infection.<br>  (C) Consult a doctors. He or she might prescribe a medicated, cream or gel effective for preventing whiteheads.<br>  (D) Aim at consuming adequate amount of fruits and vegetables in your daily diet.<br>  (E) Drink plenty of water and fresh fruit juices. A glass of warm water with the juice of lemon, helps to cleanse the body of toxic residues and help the elimination of wastes.|`|c2f510c6fde1149e390927bc7646d4c9aa	a cure for light skin would be nice too!! anything that reduces scars should help but as the scar is below the top layer of skin then the effectiveness is limited.<br>  Stretchmarks do go into silver tracks after they heal but thats obvious on both types of skin|`|F4OKs8efaa	For sure there will be better products at least if not a complete cure.

b33b2b841b148ef2f8f73241b4f3bd75aa	My friend is a hair stylist and she always suggets to stay away from heat, maybe you should see if your hair has some wave or curl to it, add some gel and play around with it. If you love curly hair go get a perm that  consists of loose waves.|`|154dzJ1Faa	You can do the home kit to try and relax some of the curl and you won't ruin your hair, because you can always cut it all of and it will grow out just the same as it always has.<br>  <br>  But anything you do to your hair chemically is going to damage it.  That is just how it is.  Will it damage it enough that you are going to have more trouble than you do now?  I don't know.<br>  <br>  I don't know if your hair is that curly as you suggest.  You may just need to learn to use what you have to your advantage.  There are so many beautiful things you can do with your hair, you just need to find what they are.<br>  <br>  When you can find a style where you use the natural tendencies of your hair, it always looks so good.  People want it the same way!  But they can't get it that way, since they have different hair.  They don't know that yours is all natural.  Right now, you are trying to be like someone else, who has different hair than you do.  You know that you are having a lot of work and trouble to get it that way.  It is so much easier to work with what you have, rather than trying to do something that is not there.<br>  <br>  For some control over the curl, and make larger waves, have you tried braiding your hair?  When it is damp after a shampoo, using a little styling aids of your choice, make two large braids, one on either side, and be sure you finish the ends into a curl as well.  The hair then must dry fully and completely.  If you have thick hair as you say, it may take 2-3 days to dry fully.... you may want to use a hood-type dryer for faster results.  But when the hair is dry, it will stay that way.  If it is slightly damp, it will revert back to curls, somewhat, and make uncontrollable kinks/curls/frizz... and you are worse off.  Make neat smooth braids, and get it dry, and you will have loose waves.<br>  <br>  For more control, use very large rollers, and wind the hair very smoothly and neatly.  Again. let dry.  You can experiment by using larger or smaller sections, by rolling all the way to the scalp or not quite, by varying size of rollers, by rolling upwards or downwards, etc.  You will find something that you really like.<br>  <br>  You will find that by setting your hair, you can go for a couple days and not have to shampoo and do it all over again.  Having to spend so much time on hair is not productive.  You need to find quicker styles.  Have you considered something shorter?  It is faster and easier to look after -- and can look very attractive when the cut is right.<br>  <br>  If possible, have a consultation with a professional stylist.  Talk over what things you want and like, they will tell you what will work best for you, and you may come up with a design that you both like.  Go home and think about it before doing anything -- you want to be sure you are going to like what you get.  There is something that is just ideal for you -- we need to find what that is.|`|Gw5j2hGOaa	First of all you want to get yourself a really good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner from a hair salon not the crap you buy at the store. It might be a bit more but it will last you a lot longer. I would say use a straightening balm that will help to relax your curls a bit,I recommend ISO straightening balm. You need a trim and somebody to thin out your hair (hairstylist,not a friend).Make sure this person can cut curly or wavy hair, not all can do this.do not attempt to straighten from a box you should spend the money and have it done right the first time.If you mess it up it will cost alot more to fix.Also when you are done use a silk serum(silky sexy anti frizz from the sexy line). when you flat iron make sure to use a flat iron spray to protect your hair from the heat damage(thermal protector from Sebastian).|`|VoxeaMhqaa	okay. so if you want it to be less upkeep, cut it. if its REALLY LONG then you might wanna cut of maybe 5 or six inches. that will also eliminate split ends. for shampoo and conditioner you will wanna use "hello hydration" by herbal essence. and for the beach waves, you might want to try using those twisty sticks things while your hair is wet before you go to bed at night.
umWL734gaa	I'm an intern to a fashion designer and it will take some hard work to become a fashion designer, just to warn you.<br>  <br>  I would suggest going to any fabric store around you.  They usually have classes you can take to learn how to sew and do all of that fun stuff.<br>  <br>  Carry around a sketchbook for any ideas you might get, but don't copy something that you see, that would be horrible.  Any ideas that are completely yours, work on them a bit.  Take art classes to work on anatomy and then you can try to start making your own pieces of clothing.  <br>  <br>  I have an adjustable mannequin that I use to make my own clothes, but you don't NEED to have one, they just come in handy.  Show some of your designs to your art teacher or an instructor of the classes at the fabric store. They should be happy to help!  <br>  <br>  Once you get into college, take some sort of graphic design class if you can.  It should not only help you with your designs, but it should give you a jump start into the fashion business. My current boss discovered me when our class was having a "fashion show" of the things we have made. <br>  <br>  I really hope this helped you and that you can become a fashion designer some day! It's tons of fun!|`|UxZCRzfOaa	take all of the above and also take textiles as it will help you learn how to make clothes and things|`|FsXTyGH9aa	hey girl! im 22 and think its great that you have a great ambition at such a young age you can get alot of experience early (hence being better than the rest)! You could look on google for a fashion design course. Or look at art schools, google is a great thing! you will find all courses and schools on it. good luck to you and never give up your dream, im sure you will be great.x|`|uC55n3HIaa	First of all, if I wasn't there to answer your previous questions check out <a href="http://www.designerbloc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designerbloc.com/</a> it's a community for fashion designers to display their designs, get community feedback, and meet other designers. And about learning how to make cloths. There arn't many workshops that teaches you how to sew. I would first ask some of your relatives if they know how to sew clothing (maybe your grandmother). If that fails, I would go to some local fabric stores and ask the people there if they know about any sewing classes in the area. If THAT fails, then google and youtube might be your only options left.|`|FgB0fg01aa	Actually, you can see if there is a recreation center near your house and see if they offer those types of classes...also you can see if there is a "main building" in your neighborhood because I have a "clubhouse" type of thing where I live and they offer a TON of classes like that. Or you can research on www.google.com and search for classes or whatever you want to do. <br>  <br>  I'm glad to know you want to become a fashion designer! Follow your dream and STAY FABULOUS! :)|`|XlxQoVU2aa	Hey i'm the same age and that's exactly what i want to do,well at your school do you have home economics because that's where i first learnt to sew i'm no very good but i know the basics, i've got a sewing machine and i'm now working on how to do certain things with the fabrics. you should try and learn to sew before you get one because they're quite expensive and you might change your mind.but practise does make perfect.(well almost perfect)also for subject choosing in school the best subjects to take are art and graphic communication...but if your school can't help you on the sewing side you can always just get a pattern and try it yourself learn by doing something and making mistakes that's the best way.. good luck<br>  i'm in scotland too but i'm in edinburgh so i'm hoping to go to Heriot Watt university when i leave school all depends how i do at school...hope i've helped and i hope you do well in your future|`|aDQCs2yAaa	take art, go to college study art fineart/graphic design then when u go to do your foundation degree/university take the fashion route

BRISyG77aa	russian or polish is sexy<br>  or japanese<br>  <br>  & if you want the names translated then you can go to google translation, it's free<br>  <br>  :)|`|knXlpvncaa	French usually looks really pretty as a tattoo. Although like the person above me said, they will probably change meaning.<br>  <br>  If you know the meaning of your family members' names, then you could maybe translate the literal meaning?|`|u9X9veEVaa	arabic! It looks nice and its pretty different|`|pwiRMmicaa	arabic or spanish|`|3x1tJRmOaa	Try Hebrew.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	You can't translate names into other languages.  My name is Katie in German, English, Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, and Esperanto.  You can't change that.<br>  <br>  All you can do is transliterate your name into different alphabets or syllabaries.  You can't translate it, because it has no semantic meaning other than the fact that it's someone's name.  If you want to get it in a different alphabet/syllabary, you need to look up the phonetic values of each character, and then figure out how to reproduce the sounds of the names as closely as possible using those symbols.<br>  <br>  There are rules to transliterating certain types of words into some writing systems, so the best bet is to find someone who actually speaks and reads the language that uses the writing system you decide on to be sure that you did it right.  For example, you cannot transliterate foreign words using kanji or hiragana; only katakana is used for non-Japanese words.<br>  <br>  It really doesn't work the way everybody thinks it does, and I'm kind of sick of people asking about how to translate names, because *you can't translate names.*  They're not translatable words, they have no semantic meaning, they're a label that is going to be the same (albeit pronounced differently) across all languages in the world.<br>  <br>  Then read the part about transliterating.  You'll have to be careful with things like Chinese, as the characters have meanings in and of themselves, and several characters can stand for one syllable.  Other writing systems don't have meanings for the different symbols apart from the syllable or sound they represent.  Do some research, ask some people who know what they're talking about.|`|rjac15O0aa	Hawaiian looks great!|`|AA11822515	You can translate any English name literally into Japanese.|`|Bv3Dm11paa	Check out www.my-hebrew-name.com beautiful writing!|`|nmC7qgtZaa	its impossible for them not to have a different meaning if your translating them|`|5EEN5vo5aa	get japanese<br>  or korean

You can find it at Walmart or any drugstore|`|fff0c9cbfcb644cc886aac2d68403090aa	If they're still reddish brown then you'll have better luck getting rid of them with Retin A gel or cream that your doctor can prescribe you. Most insurance's will cover it. But if your's doesn't it's kinda expensive, But it really helps if you stay with it.|`|xuvqrnOoaa	try to lose about 5 punds or so... and drink lots and lots of water... also fish oil wiil get rid of them so whoever told you else what is wrong.. also moisturize good after you get out of the shower and your still wet... baby oil or coca butter works
NPgJCWNjaa	its okay ! i forget to wash my belly button too ^.^ but yes, i have an innie outtie, and thats really weird because i just cleaned mine. i usually use like a&d ointment or vaseline, but its so greasy and never really gets it cleeeean clean. but today, i used ponds cold cream (Deep moisturiser/makeup remover cream) .. and when i tell you it cleaned my belly button soo well .. it really did. im happy with the results. :) btw, i always use a q-tip. safest way.<br>  <br>  <br>  also .. some of you guys are so rude. shes just asking a question. obviously most of you saying your belly buttons dont get dirty like that because you shower everyday and have an innie is BECAUSE you have an innie. she asked for people with innie/outties. you dont have to be smart about it.|`|pTzrjknPaa	mine doesn't get that dirty and i have an innie... <br>  if you shower daily, pretty sure having dirt in your belly button shouldn't be a problem. :)|`|wRwlERW6aa	haha woooow.. this has got to be the weirdest question i've ever answered but okay ...<br>  <br>  um i dont use qtips because ur supposed to wash ur bellybutton and stuff when ur taking a shower or whatever... u should try it sometime|`|Lth8UVJfaa	haha yea I've done it once and it's really awkward lol It's not that my belly button was dirty it was just mostly lint in there lol|`|GA5izZqGaa	Good on ya for q-tipping your belly button! Reading this makes compelled me to do the same hahaha. Yeah, the VERY first time my mom used this Asian scraping thing that we also use to clean earwax (sounds really gross I know) but I remember once I swabbed out my belly button with some rubbing alcohol, and yes, the Q-tip had tons of "belly lint" on it, and I was mildly freaked out.|`|OTwIKsscaa	yes it is supposed to feel weird and i have an innie belly button and i do clean it with a q-tip but it doesnt get that dirty|`|aR6e3WLoaa	well.<br>  i wash my belly button everyday.|`|hhW4j8PCaa	I, like most normal people, wash my belly button.<br>  It never gets that dirty you weirdo.|`|GvXy7V6xaa	loser.

s6miUiKSaa	Yes, it will come out less damaged. They salons have quality products to process your hair and they are trained professionals. The stylist can also recommend how to take care of your hair and what products to use.|`|wKJrZhj3aa	Going to a salon will help because they have access to bleaches that are much more gentle than the ones you can at sallys or in a store open to the public. However, if you are going from a natural black to blond, there is always going to be dry and damaged. Its BLEACH!! :) If you are doing your entire head i would ALWAYS suggest going in and getting a pro to do it.|`|4wIZfiWaaa	Go to a professional salon and get your hair bleached.

Ask your stylist for tips.|`|xXMUyCalaa	depends on where u go lol, and plus depends on what ur hair is like..and how many times its been colored..ur best bet go to the best salon u hear of with u having naturally black hair they wont take u straight to bleach blonde if they know what their doing.|`|R8bXuLbTaa	I bleached my hair at home for years and it was in pretty good shape BUT once I started getting it done professionally I never did it myself again.<br>  <br>  It was still fairly dry but the color was so much more superior and she did a gloss conditioning treatment on me which made my hair feel super soft.<br>  <br>  Get it done by a pro!

I also like mineral foundation for oily skin as I find it lasts longer on my skin and looks more natural.  You skin may be getting used to the climate and it's adjusting so that's why your breaking out, as your oil production is working harder in the humid weather.  It could possibly be a heat rash.<br>  For your hair, try some different styles like putting it up, using a hair extension with a jaw clip(your hair will always look good:). Use a shampoo for volume(Matrix Amplfy is wonderful and my saviour) it really gives you lots of body. I also use their Iron Sleek spray and spray it on before I straight iron my hair and holds great.  You can also try a teaspoon of sea salt with water in a spray bottle to get that beachy wavy look.|`|elYiFxMkaa	For makeup... apply primer all over the face (Smashbox is great) and itstead of covering the face with foundation, try spot concealing. Just cover any blemishes and dark under eye circles and apply powder on the t-zone.  Also, I would suggest oil blotting sheets. It soaks up the oil and controls shine. Get the powder-free oil blotting sheets so that way you won't have patches of powder on certain areas of the face.<br>  <br>  For the hair, use some hair serum to control any frizz. Or you can try some curl cream. Just apply it to damp hair, scrunch and create some curls using your fingers and just let it air dry.

KwNpyp3saa	What do you mean by relaxer line? Do you mean where to apply the relaxer? If it is for virgin hair, then you begin at the back about 1/4" from the scalp. Apply all over the hair and then apply to the hair near the scalp. <br>  <br>  If you are talking about applying as a retouch then you should start from the front and be careful not to "overlap" from the regrowth and the previous straightened hair. This can cause breakage. <br>  <br>  Be sure you follow the directions carefully. Also remember to choose the one that is best for your hair texture. If you are not sure, ask someone there which is best for your hair type.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|oOzNMiKtaa	I'm assuming you're talking about where to apply the relaxer. If this is the case, the relaxer should only be applied to the new growth of the hair. If it is applies to the rest of the hair every time you need a relaxer, then it will wear your hair thin and break it off.|`|gtUFYA7naa	..you can have a look at the Latest Hairstyles <br>  <a href="http://www.topnewsblog.info/tblog_10785.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.topnewsblog.info/tblog_10785....</a>|`|t3zEvX2Gaa	i think you need to be more specific with your answer. are you talking about the line that becomes visible when it grows out?|`|154dzJ1Faa	Where does the relaxer line go to??  What do you mean?<br>  <br>  It goes to where you apply the relaxer.  You only apply it to the hair that you want to straighten.  It all depends on the type of hair and the style you want to achieve.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, we leave a little curl at the very scalp, to provide us a bit of lift for styling.  Making it straight right from the roots can cause excessive strain and breakage often results right at that spot.  By relaxing partially some of the curl, there is a nicer transition when the natural curl starts to grow out more.<br>  <br>  Sometimes we only want the mid-shaft straight, and leave some curl on the ends, for styling versatility, and depending on the style we want.  If there is a previous relaxer used, that may be harder to do.<br>  <br>  You always only apply the relaxer to the regrowth, never to previously relaxed hair.  Double processing the hair only weakens it further, and often can result in breakage occurring right at that transition line.  You will see this as a lot of shorter hairs... all the same length -- a good sign that breakage occurred because of over-lapping.<br>  <br>  But without knowing fully what you are asking, it is hard to give a full answer.

You tell him how you want it to look, very exactly, using correct terminology.  The best is to show him several pics so he knows what you are saying.  People just don't know the right words, and then get upset when no one understands what they are saying.<br>  <br>  If you have straight flat hair, that is what you have.  Cutting it any way is not going to change that.  Sometimes you need movement in your hair, but straight will not work.  You need to learn to work WITH your hair, and not against it.  It always wins.<br>  <br>  Consult with your barber.  Tell him and show him what you would like.  He has enough experience (which you don't) to know if it can be done with your hair, and what would work best with your hair, that is close enough to what you want.

Unfortunately the only real results come from the more expensive tanning beds, because they have better bulbs relative to face and body. It also depends on the lotion that you are using and your own skin tone and how it takes the tan. It does take a short while to see a noticable difference. I would recommend using a higher bulb bed, using lotion that has bronzer in it and going more often then you have been. :)

P5iIwpcJaa	Any curling iron would be good with that. But I'd suggest that a 1 inch is good, because you can always makes  waves as big or as small you want. With this, you can curl it loosely, so dont make it too tight, and then kinda brush it out.<br>  <br>   Another one thats good is a three barrel curling iron, which is like this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?skuId=2127495&productId=prod2127495&navAction=push&navCount=1&categoryId=cat1000003" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...</a><br>  <br>  and you just press your hair between it at the top, and then continue down. But make sure you take small pieces. It makes it easier. And then you just lightly brush therough your hair with your fingers.|`|X8ImtFIDaa	thats mre wavy than curly. you coud use acrimper and then tease it. a curling iron wont do ****|`|IfyFk3q6aa	the hair in the pictures is more wavy than curly, if you get a curling iron no matter what size it will give you spiral curls.

154dzJ1Faa	You don't use "dye" on hair.  You use a hair colour, or tint.  Dyes are for fabrics.<br>  <br>  It matters little what brand.  They are all the same but different.  What is important is where you are starting from (your hair colour) and where you want to get to.  Then you know what to use to get there.<br>  <br>  It is rare that you can take any colour off the shelf and that is what you use.  Professionals always mix several shades together to get the final result, based on the level and the tonal highlights present in the hair, and what they want to achieve.  You don't have that training and experience.  It would be best that you have a professional hair colourist perform this service for you.  It ends up cheaper this way.

7tRTZhnLaa	Well I think that people get piercing because they like the way they look but with a tongue ring you can't eve see if. To me that mean that the person obviously only got the piercing for sexual reasons, which I think is trashy. And not only is it trashy but a stupid idea because when you get your tongue pierced your risking paralyzing it. So basically when I see a tongue ring I think the person is a dumb tramp.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	i think they are brave because i've heard they hurt! but i don't judge people based on their piercings.<br>  <br>  but i've heard a lot of people say they are only for blow jobs.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	i dont think anything, its just another piercing it doesnt change who they are or what i think of them.<br>  just because someone has a piercing doesnt mean they suck d*** like a bunch of people think/say.|`|SW6fButzaa	Well, I do not think anything of the person, neither good nor bad, I do not think they have a tongue ring or anywhere has anything to do with whatever the person rioja rioja tiene.Mira I got in the language long ago "Apart from other sites and I am a homely girl, you do not like going out at night and not smoke or drink alcohol or take drugs but I have many piercings and tattoos and wearing just because I like it because I seem nice and pretty decorating the body.|`|68f6c15f9d67c3586ec2dfa091e5a106aa	i think they have great taste in piercings,,,, cuz i have mine done too..<br>  lots of ppl say it's for going down on ppl,,, but thats a load of crap... it's jus a piercing.... but i jus have always liked it and my parents wouldnt let me get one so wen i turned 18 i did it i got all the piercings i wanted now im going to get tattoos<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *EDIT*<br>  <br>  For the person above me .. it really depends on the person... for examole wen i got mine done i could eat and drink anything i wanted.. right after i got it done i went to burger king right after.. and they tell u not to drink or smoke cigarrettes but i did both and my healed really quick.....|`|0b749584c35f2d85b042fb4c77b72f79aa	Girl- slut.<br>  Boy- showoff.<br>  <br>  I think this coz peircing tounges ist't worth its trouble.

Good Luck!|`|boqwvEvUaa	if you really want to. i mean, it's your hair ;) plus, if it's really long right now, you can donate it to locks of love. <br>  or if you could try getting a layered bob, pixie cut or something similar, and see if you prefer that before you cut it that short...<br>  i think if you have the right face shape and features, you could pull it off ;)|`|4593057a35a6cd4bd6202267b788e26eaa	If you really feel that way then do it, doesn't matter what other people think, it only matters what you think.

6npsRIzUaa	Ugh, please don't use neosporin on a piercing.<br>  <br>  Sea salt soak it twice a day (1/4 tsp of sea salt for a cup of water, SEA salt, not regular table salt), try to avoid sleeping on it, and I'd suggest changing the jewelry to a CBR (captive bead ring) or an open clasp because butterfly backs give the piercing no room to breathe, they're fine after initial healing period, but I wouldn't wear them for longer than a couple of hours. Earlobes really aren't something to worry about if they get infected, they're easy to heal and if it's not better in a couple of days, or it gets wore over night, find a professional piercer to check it out and look into buying organic or acyrlic jewelry because it's very possible you're having an allergic reaction to the jewelry.|`|CdBoe8XSaa	it's probably not caused by sleeping on it, but that could just irritate it a bit.<br>  if it's just a earlobe piercing it's not a big deal if it gets infected, unless it's really serious somehow it'll heal pretty soon.<br>  just keep cleaning it about twice a day|`|qhEYwNYFaa	Wash it at least twice a day with antibacterial soap and warm water, then apply neosporin.

r4i7xPnMaa	Just because she said she's pretty and she likes her eyes and lips doesn't mean she's conceited. If she was truly conceited, she wouldn't bother asking for help because she'd be convinced that she was already pretty enough as it is. And as far as vanity goes, she's no more vain than anybody else here, looking for makeup advice.<br>  There's nothing wrong with having some confidence. Not everybody thinks they look awful every day.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I think you should let your hair down. Maybe do something different to it. Curl it, straighten it, whichever you're more equipped to do. I'd suggest plucking your eyebrows, but don't go crazy with it. Just try to clean them up a little bit. Work on defining the arch, and make sure you keep 'em symetrical!<br>  <br>  As far as makeup, maybe try a simple smokey eye. I've found that hers is the easiest.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCnJ8B0Ay14&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCnJ8B0Ay...</a><br>  Just make sure you keep the lips nude (try a matte nude shade) or else it'll be overkill.

If you wanna emphasize your lips, then go for a simple eye makeup.<br>  <br>  -For the hair, just go for the style that you usually doesn't do. Your friends will be surprised if you up do your do!

Kx0XoZpmaa	definitely. it will also stunt your hairs growth. straightening your hair every day will make it more frizzy and thin your hair out. it can give you more dead ends, too. even if your straightener is really high quality it can still do a lot of damage to your hair.|`|D1c8cRM4aa	yes, your hair shouldn't have so much heat on it constently, it'll begin to get thin then break off|`|154dzJ1Faa	Yes.  It is not so much how often you do it (although there is no need to do it every second day) but how you do it.  From experience, I know that most people just do not know how to use these very hot implements.  They really are quite dangerous, and need to be used by trained persons.  It is the extreme heat which damages the hair, and by applying too much heat in any section of hair, there is permanent damage, which can only be repaired by cutting that hair off.<br>  <br>  Many hairdressers don't mind, because you have to come in and get repair treatments, and purchase products to make the hair look better.  There is nothing wrong with the implement -- it is only a tool -- but the most important part of that tool is the nut holding it.  When used correctly, as a supplement to proper styling, they prove very useful.  But they can also do incredible damage.<br>  <br>  Just be careful, and you will be alright.  Use it when necessary -- every second day is excessive.|`|fgLRSo61aa	i own a chi too, i am in 10th grade i have been straightening since 8th grade.<br>  my hair is not as wavy as it used to be, i have split ends on the bottom, but its not noticeable with my hair type, my hair looks normal because i use the chi heat protectant, and i condition it.|`|X8ImtFIDaa	idk what CHI is but if you straighten it every OTHER day than there is no way it will get ruined. but if you want to be super safe than you can out on heat protection spray|`|a667205402b2d65fe82c6c60e1f5b18faa	yes very, doesn't matter what hair straightner you have you're hair will be damaged long term|`|z3fOLYjiaa	Yes, using any type of straightener will cause damage to your hair, but you can help it by always using some sort of heat spray/cream prior to straightening and always make sure your hair is dry before straightening as well.

If it straightened his hair it will work for anyone.|`|ifSFTyjhaa	GHD....but try opting for something less damaging....<br>  <br>  i have a ghd and due to the amount of heat it uses i use it only once a week|`|ISRTiSnoaa	a ceramic one works the best, usually the more expensive ones, unfortunately...|`|hhi8nbvHaa	Even though i'm a little blonde girl, my hair <br>  is pretty much an afro, I use the chi along <br>  with Silk therepy spray, and it works like a charm <br>  it heats up in about 3 minutes and only takes <br>  about 10 minutes to straighten it completly ! <br>  I got mine for 50$ because i have a friend who <br>  got it for me cheep but they're around 100-200$|`|xgYA00muaa	GHD'S ! !<br>  there the best a girl can buy, there not cheap though.<br>  I don't have one but 2 of my mates do and i know a load who want them :)<br>  there about ￡100 if your american sorry but i dont know if there avaliable there or how much they are, but there great|`|DhOjQM34aa	GHDs most definitely. They are amazing, heat up in like 6 seconds, and they straighten your hair so well first time round. They're really expensive though, about ￡100.

S6rB7GgFaa	I've had a perm before. Also my mom is a hairstylist. she says if you have previously colored your hair there is a better chance of your hair frying, falling out, thinning etc. perms also need ALOT of care. When I permed my hair it took forever to brush it, but everyone is different also if you want your hair straightened just run the blow dryer through your hair. but this also can fade the perm causing it not to last as long. I hope I helped you!!!!! p.s nothing happened to my hair when I permed it, but I've never colored my hair.|`|wKJrZhj3aa	wait until all the bleach is out of your hair. let it grow and continue to cut off the bleached ends. Until then, I wouldnt suggest getting it permed. you may be overprocessing the bleached areas and it runs the risk of a "chemical haircut"     when hair is so overprocessed, it'll just break off at the most damaged areas.|`|A7HNyYvmaa	I'd go over to www.stylistbook.com to find a stylist in your area and have him/her look at your hair in person. That way they will be able to gauge how much damage has already been done to your hair by the bleaching, and see if you should go ahead with the perm. That said, I'm growing my hair out now so I can perm it, so I definitely think perms are cute.|`|Vge3KBaMaa	NO NO NO NO why the hell would you want to ruin ure hair with a perm , do you wanna look like some kind of 80'sreject ? get with the times hunni .|`|IPohxAUJaa	try rollers or ' ragging' perm if you want to and get a perm if you are willing to live with curls but i don't think it will look great when it starts growing out coz i wanted one and that put me off|`|226OM9Ikaa	Yes, I get perms. <br>  They're great. The first few days it will look much curlier than you would like, but in 2 days you can wash it, and the curls relax to where they will stay. I would definitely recommend them. <br>  Just make sure you emphasize to your stylist that you want more waves than springy curls. <br>  Good luck!

qeNrGoMsaa	Your hair needs to be up in curls in the back.  A few dangling curls on the side of your face making you look soft and delicate.This shows the length of you neck and the hair style will also add height to you. Accessories can be from Claire's.....maybe a tiara on the head. A matching silver with crystals necklace, matching drop earrings, and silver bangles(a few). Finish with a silver bag and silver shoes. Shop the discount stores first to see if you can luck into stuff.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	I think that that dress is beautieful, maybee you should try  a really fancy black hair clip, black heels, a black dropping necklace, and maybe a black charm bracelett.|`|vmCkQFbLaa	aww someones a senior..lol..<br>  ok well since your dress is purple, you should find purple heels or black would be fine, you can also wear flats if you dont feel like getting a strain on your feet...<br>  your bag, i dont think wearing something huge is suitable "since its prom"<br>  just get a small purse that matches your dress, it could even be a strapless purse and just hold it the whole time..<br>  i hope that works..<br>  oh yeah go get your makeup done at MAC or SEPHORA...

kuZiLT1waa	No, a suit or dress shirt and tie with slacks is appropriate.  You want to present yourself in a professional manner to indicate you will represent the security company as well as their clients positively.|`|pKdMbptSaa	both are fine|`|Dv6KSxmlaa	In security, you're in the public eye and essentially a member of the public relations sector of that business, so anything that makes you look like you're good at dealing with people will do. As far as what to wear goes, bigger is probably better for formality. If you can overdress a little with a suit, that's probably perfect. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you don't have access to a suit for some reason, a dress shirt and pants should do the trick nicely as well.

BbqSapJIaa	i would suggest right, since your bangs are on your left. <br>  if you don't have any other face piercings, this will look<br>  more balanced.|`|dHkvVlONaa	Id say since your side bangs go to the left, get it on the right.  And the left side is not for lesbians lol.  thats just so untrue.  Get it one whatever side you think would look better.|`|IN1oikSbaa	That nonsense is something you dont worry about. That's like saying if you like the color purple, you're gay. <br>  That's retarded and completely not true. <br>  <br>  The way pierces typcially decide which side you get pierced(if you have no preference) is which side has less piercings. For example. If I have 4 in my left year and 7 in my right, I'd get my piercing on my left side of my face to balance out the rest. <br>  Like if I have a left nose piercing, I'd get a right monroe. <br>  <br>  That's typically how it's done, but you can get it done where ever you want.<br>  And remember. Piercings last longer than hair. Hair grows and can be restyled. Piercings cant be changed. <br>  <br>  Good luck and happy piercing. :)
9xTMRkKWaa	Before you put on your makeup, wash your face and apply a light moisturizer.  Do not let the moisturizer get near your eyes (where you eyeliner should be).  Let the moisturizer sink in for about 10 minutes.  Then apply your makeup as usual.  Before you put your eyeliner on, put a little bit of powder there.  Then, apply your eyeliner normally.  Put a little powder on over your eyeliner and apply your eyeliner again.  This should help it stay.  Also put some powder on your eyelid where your eyeliner may be touching your face.  Take a powder compact with you to school to touch up in between classes.  It can be inexpensive powder like Cover Girl so don't worry about spending lots of money.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|rHwMf2P4aa	Use a expensive kind, if you use cheap stuff it wears off from the temperature of your body and sweating.|`|H6ixrUYLaa	For your face, you should prime it before you put your foundation on.<br>  Also, prime or put a base on your eyes before you put the eye shadow on.<br>  Your mascara should not come off during the day, or you're buying a crappy brand of mascara.|`|Ze0XaOwnaa	Do you have oily skin.?<br>  Because if you do then it will come off quickly, try a drying moisturizer. <br>  You can also get like a spray/cream that you can apply after you put your makeup on to make it stay on, or go to your local drug store and ask them for some help. <br>  Feel free to e-mail me for any further questions you may have :)|`|Yu7y6yfraa	Loreal makes liquid make up that stays on all day.  It stays on me, even when I live in the wilderness for a couple of days.   Go with an oil based makeup designed to have a lot of staying power.<br>  <br>  Putting a light coat of powder over the makeup helps to keep it looking nice.<br>  <br>  Instead of using eyeliner, I use a cotton tip and dark eye shadow to line my eyes with.  That seems to hold up well also.|`|DkVofG9paa	if your buying super cheap make up and cant afford something a bit more expensive... you may be out of luck.  generally speaking.. real cheap make up tends to wear off quick.  i have revlon eyeliner and it stays on ALL day. it's costs about $7 jsut for a stick of eyeliner, and $7 for my liquid eyeliner.  You get in the more expensive side when you buy MAC.. so as for cheaper make up you'll get a cheaper effect.  No dollar store make up, okay?!|`|cRqCyIdRaa	It depends. Do you sweat it off, or what. All make up doesnt last all day, but usually not as quick as what you are saying. Look for make up that say long lasting, stuff like that. My make up is still on and I put it on at around 6:50am..|`|9bbdc20b632823bb696d4cc04ae83d88aa	Apply moisturizer before you put on your makeup. That should help a lot. Also you may need to buy more expensive makeup. I have found that when it comes to makeup you do get what you pay for. Cheaper brands wear off quickly. If all else fails take your makeup with you and reapply as needed.|`|xSw48qj8aa	Are you rubbing your eyes? or just touching your face? or maybe just sweating?<br>    don't touch your face or eyes in school, cuz that is a definite reason that happens to me all the time. if you're in gym, maybe you sweat, and it comes off that way?<br>    hope this helps! good luck!|`|37a6c8320b8d6c53cc6b5bc5f10c6e0faa	use some cheap powder then u can find powder for like $1, then that way the oil on ur face wont mess up the makeup throughout the day|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	The same thing happens to me.  Just re-apply it around 4th or 5th period and your good to go.|`|9WOCYpadaa	You should have some type of base or primer so that your makeup can stick to it :)|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	It sounds like you may have oily skin. Use facial products and makeup that are oil-free. For eyeliner, make sure you use a liquid, not pencil.|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	that's generally not as bad of a situation as it seems.|`|Drb9EP5Kaa	apply a good oil-controlling primer before you put on your makeup. It helps.|`|iULt8UB9aa	If you are using eyeliner on the outside of your eyes, here's a trick I learned years ago to keep it on: find a shade of eyeshadow that matches the eyeliner as close as possible and apply a light coat over the eyeliner.  Your eyeliner will stay on all day.  You can even use the cheap pencil eyeliners (.97 cents at Wal Mart) and they will stay on with a little eyeshadow on top--trust me, I've been doing it for years!!<br>  <br>  This is the order I put my makeup on and it lasts all day: Revlon colorstay liquid foundation, then concealer, blush, powder (LOOSE powder--it "sets" the makeup), then eye makeup, then lipstick.|`|4LFOXCnOaa	stop touching ur face|`|Iiiw2PmDaa	try glueing it to your face. hehe ^.^~  I uses maybelline and i look blushy now..later ^.*|`|pTCcbKeDaa	Do you put foundation on your eyelids before applying eye make-up? that generally helps it to stay on. as a rule, liquid eyeliner stays on a lot better than pencil. it may seem hard to put on at first but keep practicing and keep Q-tips handy to fix any mistakes and you'll be way happier. is your mascara water proof? water proof typically stays on longer. you might try changing foundation brands. if you want to stay with less expensive stuff, try cover girl. it always worked well for me. if you tend to have oily skin, make sure to apply a good astringent in the morning before applying the make-up to keep it on longer. hope this helps!|`|Qtgrx3Ywaa	When it comes to foundation and powder, I don't really know what advice to give.  For mascara and eyeliner though, I do find it works splurge a little (not over the top "spend all you got" type thing).  And for eyeshadow, I hear eyeshadow primer keeps it on for a very long time. =)<br>  <br>  Another tip is to ask the sales people at whatever store you shop at.  ULTA has reasonable prices and their people are usually always willing to help people.|`|5hKiN1xhaa	Well stop buying the cheap stuff and ask your parents for cash or get a job and get the good stuff, that's probably your make up comes off, or i guess it could be that you have a greasy face and the make up comes off or you had P.E and your sweat removes the make up|`|9CmzS0dsaa	Plain and simple... stop using cheap make up, if u want mke up tat wont fall of like 2 hrs after u put it on then go spend some good money on some good make up, u know using cheap make up isnt good for ur skin either, and y do u wear so much make up, im glad i hve great skin i dont wear make up at all|`|BGCiqQFgaa	I have that problem too. Don't touch your eyes or face. It might be because of sweat though and you can't do anything for that.

It's a little high ($16.50 at Ulta or $16 at Sephora) but it really does keep your makeup on all day. It's a little steep..but the one small tube lasts a very long time. It also keeps the eyeshadow from creasing and makes them appear brighter! :)<br>  <br>  They also make primers for face makeup..(Revlon has some) but I've never seen them before, only heard about them.|`|2VndjiIRaa	Try primers. there are many brands that make primers for lips, eyes, your face.....makeup artists say primers are supposed to keep makeup on longer and keep your skin looking dewey and fresh all throughout the day....<br>  the cheapest i have seen is Rimmel Face Primer.|`|NSJXB9Txaa	Well, in the morning wash your face and dry before putting your make up on. if you sweat or touch your face a lot then that is why your make up is coming off

It will either work or not, so they will know:) I love the dress!!! great pick.|`|fu4VXe1iaa	The dress is really great but I don't like the fact that it's strapless because of the "pulling it up every 5 minutes" aspect of this kind of dress.

lIpjuMTHaa	Well, this will work well if you actually follow it:<br>  <br>  For at least 10 days, drink around 10 servings/day of the following:<br>  <br>      * 2 Tablespoons (1 fluid ounce) fresh-squeezed lemon or lime juice NOT BOTTLED JUICE!! (approx. 1/2 lemon),<br>      * 2 Tablespoons (1 fluid ounce) organic Grade B maple syrup,<br>      * 1/10 Teaspoon or more cayenne pepper (hot red pepper), and<br>      * 1 Cup (8 fluid ounces) purified or spring water, NOT fluoridated water.<br>  <br>  This is the equivalent of taking an empty gallon water jug and filling it with:<br>  <br>      * the juice of 5 lemons<br>      * 1 1/4 cup of organic Grade B maple syrup<br>      * 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper<br>      * 10 cups of water<br>  <br>  Shake it all up and you got your days’ serving!<br>  <br>  Its gross but it works.|`|tEIGR2vFaa	Exercise, any kind, at least three times a week. Don't go on a Spartan-like diet, but eat the more unhealthy foods you like *in moderation/only every so often*. And make sure your daily calorie count isn't too much. That's what really matters, the amount of calories you take in per day.|`|DocXfujAaa	If you eat normal, don't diet.<br>  <br>  My advice would be go to a gym. If you can't, or don't want to than do situps/crunches and jogging in place.<br>  <br>  You're better off jogging in place like 3 times a day than all at once. It increases your metabolism while doing it, and after. But if you keep doing it it should keep it up for more time, overall.<br>  <br>  Jumping jacks work too. Just do anything that could get you out of breath and/or heart rate up.|`|hhYHGHNsaa	eat vegetables and drink lots of water. <br>  climbing stairs is really good exercise! <br>  eat fruits too! <br>  do exercises that get your metabolism up. they're the best for you!<br>  i know what your trying to do cuz im trying to do it too! im 5"2 and im like 115 pounds! i really need to lose some weight.<br>  looks like were in the same boat sista! lol!<br>  <3|`|H6ixrUYLaa	Hot yoga.|`|kVxharmraa	Pilates help a lot.|`|rPFfDR7Laa	this might not be what you want to hear, but exercise and eat less.<br>  i used to be a dietetics major in college (nutrition), and all of those fad diets don't work.  start working out (walking or running) 3 times a week if that's all you can stand, for 30 min to an hour.  and once you are used to that, try 5 days a week (take weekends off as a treat).  on itunes, you can look up free podcasts for exercise.  I like all of the pilates they have :)  for any exercise program you need cardio AND strength training or resistance.  if you build up some muscle that will burn fat and calories faster.  you will see results quickly if you keep it up.  Start keeping track of the calories you eat.  cut out 500 calories per week and you will lose one pound a week from that alone (that's a pound you won't put back on :)  it's better to lose weight and keep it off than it is to lose it quickly by starving yourself, all of that weight will just creep back on.  Cut out junk food and soda.  drink water and milk.  eat plenty of fruits, veggies, lean protein, and whole grains.  there ya go :)|`|fgsVyB0Naa	First of all, it will take an agonizingly long time! (sorry about that :T) <br>  <br>  Seconly, its pretty simple. You need to burn more calories than you eat! So, eat foods that are high in nutrients but fill you up.( like beans! lots of protien and keep you really full!) <br>  <br>  Walk or have some sort of activity about 3 times a week<br>  <br>  What helped me in the begining is keeping a food diary. Write down every single thing that goes in you mouth. (even a handfull of something.) you will be unpleasantly suprised at what all you ate. ik i was... So that will motivate you to eat healthyer.<br>  <br>  So, if you do the things above, and keep these up for a couple of months, u will notice a graudual change. Ik i did! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Z4HD1hgFaa	piloxing. its weird, i know. its in seventeen, the one about spring break. also, running anything that brings ur heart rate up and keeps it up for about 30min.|`|DhTtm3ayaa	GOOD LUCK.

I started doing this diet thing  that i use to do last year that seemed to work. Honestly all you really have to do is exercise and watch what u eat. I know its what everyone says but its true. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables and dont have any snacks. If u do have lik a special k bar or something. have a big breakfast and if u feel any hunger cravings just resist as much as u can. Yoga is an amazinggggg exercise plan. It works ur whole body and u get results quick. I also joined the track team at my school and that alone helped alot. Over the weekend or something go to a park and just run and run and run. You just have to be commited and you'll do it in no time. Hope i helped =]
4GkTT9HVaa	Well naturally every retail store that sells Vans or any item will give you a discount if you work there, it's just a perk that goes along with the retail industry.<br>  <br>  It's kind of a strange question, and defiantly not one that you want to ask during an interview (your employer doesn't want to hire someone just for their need of a discount)<br>  <br>  But if you have good work ethics (one being excellent at customer service, which they can train you in) you should apply at a Vans retail store, they have a vast variety of shoes. And just like all retail, it has it's perks.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped! Good luck!

This is the best info site that I know of - <a href="http://tattoo.about.com/" rel="nofollow">http://tattoo.about.com/</a> - there's nothing really that isn't on there.<br>  <br>  If it helps, the one thing I regret not doing more research into before I had my first ever tattoo was the actual styles and techniques on offer in this day and age. I didn't know much about tattoos at all so my ideas of designs were pretty limited. I don't regret the choice because it was for my son and it means a lot to me, but if I knew half the stuff I knew now I'd have something totally different.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|LBHJaqXoaa	Aftercare instructions: every artist has his or her own set of aftercare instructions. Use them. Basically keep it clean, keep it moist with the proper stuff, and have some patience during the healing process.<br>  <br>  Google is a great resource for finding tattoos you like. Just search google images with the phrase you want, like "flower tattoos" or "tribal tattoos". You get millions of results each time. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|m0KleJrvaa	Tattoojohnny.com<br>  Vanishingtattoo.com|`|FDgHnvm3aa	just punch it into yahoo ro google.   the best info is a culmination.<br>  <br>  or ask on here.

HvsQGh0gaa	a good moisturizer is essential even when your face doesn't feel stiff. it doesn't really matter how much you spend on make up removers or face washes but you should spend more on a good moisturizer! hope i helped|`|laSBohonaa	its stiff because its winter and your skin gets a lot more dry than it normally would. put on an oil free face lotion|`|4TmcopjUaa	Your skin is probably dry as stated in the prior posts.  However, you could also be using a product that does not blend with your skin very well.  Try a different brand like Noxzema.  See if that helps.  also, moisturizers are a must after washing your face, swimming, before applying makeup, etc.  Keep your face nicely moisturized and it will be good to you.|`|N1qV2CbZaa	Either the scrub is too harsh or the product could be working.

NqWl2qlPaa	I think you would look cute with hair a little below chin length, looks like maybe two inches off, it's hard to judge from the pic.

Use heat protectant on your hair as well.|`|6XqK04DCaa	Girl, i had the same prob<br>  No matter what i did it wouldnt stay straight<br>  My hair is wavy too<br>  SO what i started doing was instead of trying to get pin straight hair i would take the straightner and curl the bottoms in and give it body.|`|wNZ95AK3aa	you should use a serem in your hair when its wet run it from the roots to the ends this will help stop it from frizzing.u can buy it in boots.there bis also spray in ones also|`|ZC7frJBQaa	have u asked ya friends how they did it? or spray it will hairspray and will probs stay in!|`|gWvdKHDLaa	They have tons of different lotions and smoothing fluids for your hair, sold everywhere. I have naturally REALLY curly hair and once I straighten it, I barely ever have to touch it.<br>  I suggest using an Aussie product, they work really well.<br>  Or, because I had a similar problem to yours, try Tresseme styling putty. When you're done straightening your hair, just rub it in your hands and put it ON THE TIPS OF YOUR HAIR, including bangs, if you have them. For extra protection, use it almost everywhere in your hair, just not your bangs. It makes them really hard looking and gross. It's also good if you have runaway hairs on the top of your head.<br>  <br>  Or if it's not that, maybe your aren't straightening long enough. Go REALLY slow when straightening your hair. I find that a lot of people that don't go slow enough have extra frizzy or wavy hair.<br>  Also, if you have problems with waves in the back of your head, use a hand mirror and look into it through a bigger mirror, the hand mirror facing the back of your head. It really works, and my hair is really straight.<br>  Hope it helped, if you choose to do this. :]|`|xaRyvznHaa	ok i have curly hair, frizzy hair, and i straighten my hair everyday and it stays all day, and sometimes longer. all you need to do is wash it real good. PUT NO PRODUCTS IN IT!!! That makes it more wavy and kills it more and makes it more greasy. the only good products for it are heat protectors or a little hairspray to make it stay. <br>  <br>  Ok make sure the iron is really hot. Then section your hair, spray your hair with a heat protection, (if you have it, you don't really need it just helps your hair.) then take one section down and start to straighten it. do not go through the section too many times and do not keep the iron on one piece of hair for too long either, (make sure you don't go too fast, as well). When your down with one section take down another. when your done with all of the sections, look at it in the mirror if there is a part that is not straight like you want it, straighten that part again.<br>  <br>  When you are all done put a LITTLE hair spray in it. and that should last it all day, maybe even longer.<br>  <br>  If all fails, your iron may not be strong enough to handle your hair, so you may need to get a stronger iron, or you can reverse perm your hair, makes it completely straight for about 2 to 3 months, but that kills your hair so to keep it looking good you would have to buy certain shampoos and conditioner for dead hair, to help it stay healthly and look normal. ( i did it and my hair is doing ok, but straightening it is better for you hair.)<br>  <br>  Hoped this helped.<br>  :)|`|4OQmJ6gFaa	I have the exact same problem and my hair isn't even curly - it's wavy.

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Congratulations on going natural! I went natural last summer and I love it. <br>  <br>  Coarse is your hair texture and your can't change this. I would stay away from products that people with relaxers use on their hair because they will cause a whole lotta build-up and they contain ingredients that no one should put in their hair. Stay away from products that contain petroleum and don't use products where petroleum, mineral oil, and lanonlin are at the top of the ingredients lists. These are some of the worst ingredients one can put in her hair. <br>  <br>  You'll most likely use different products during the summer and winter. During the winter I've had to switch over to different moisturizers because the ones I used during the summer just weren't getting my hair moisturized enough. Plus, during the summer I could just add water to my hair and seal with oil and this was all my hair needed. During the winter this regimine doesn't work. For daily moisturizers I use Nexus and Neutrogena Tripple Moisture. I've recently started using a product called Wen ( <a href="http://www.wenhaircare.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wenhaircare.com</a> or <a href="http://www.chazdean.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.chazdean.com</a> ) and this works very well. <br>  <br>  If your not already, start sealing in your moisture with a natural oil like olive oil, I use pure olive oil. Buy it at a grocery store, it's cheaper. After you moisturize your hair like normal take some olive oil and rub it through your hair. This will seal in that moisture and keep your hair moisturized for a longer period of time. You'll most likely have to experiment with different moisturizers before you find the right one for your hair and there are many natural oils you can choose from such as coconut and jojoba oils. Many can also be found at health foods stores. You can also look into buying natural butters. Shea butter is very good for keeping the hair moisturized. You can buy this online, at a health foods store, or at an ethnic boutique, like an African or Jamaican shop. <br>  <br>  Some sites where you can get more advice and tips: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.motowngirl.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.motowngirl.com</a><br>  <a href="http://forum.blackhairmedia.com" rel="nofollow">http://forum.blackhairmedia.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nappturality.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.nappturality.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.longhaircareforum.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.longhaircareforum.com</a>|`|vi2bzq0Caa	I live in a cold climate as well.<br>  Do not worry, I got you covered!<br>  Welcome to the nature side of life.<br>  <br>  Email me at awhet087@ymail.com<br>  I will answer all of your natural hair questions there.|`|Na5Wg0f5aa	Pink Moisturizer and products found in stores have mineral oil and petroleum in it which makes the hair feel really greasy and does not truly condition the hair..this is typically found in black hair care products but it is really bad for our hair.

The Curls By Nature, Coily Locks Custard, and Kiwi Coconut Hair Smoothie would do really well at moisturizing and keeping your hair nice and soft without being dry.
