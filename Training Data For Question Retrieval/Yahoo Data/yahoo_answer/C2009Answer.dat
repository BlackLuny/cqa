The home theme download was a limited time invitation but you can try.|`|cLhT4Acdaa	i dont know about that but the full version is supposed to come out this week|`|pOi0wewIaa	You have to be a member of the Playstation Underground <br>  then<br>  Wait until they give (possible) a code for Home|`|yrQFXxcXaa	Download the home theme from playstation store if it's still there then it will appear in the list on xmb where folding @ home is .
09644ZZSaa	A dial tone is used on land-line telephone systems to let the user know that a signal is available. If the phone is dead or the system is down they won't hear a dial tone and they will know they can't place a call.<br>  <br>  On cell phones you have other ways of knowing whether you can place a call or not. You may have no bars of signal strength or your phone display may read "network unavailable." There is no need for a dialtone on a cell phone, and technically if there was, it would be going all the time that the phone was on until you started dialing.|`|AA10131545	The dial tone was invented as a signal to inform the user that the system was listening and ready to accept your number. It serves no other purpose.<br>  <br>  Your mobile phone accepts your number independent of the telecommunication system. When you press "Call," your phone negotiates with the network on its own. This is similar to the mobile phone waiting for a dial tone. It's just not YOU waiting for the acknowledgment that the system is ready.<br>  |`|h2NnaTcBaa	Are you serious? <br>  <br>  <br>  dial tones are for telephones / landlines.

09644ZZSaa	The way Rhapsody works is you are basically renting the songs. If you cancel your subscriptions the songs will no longer play after your subscription expires. You also need to sync the phone with rhapsody at least once a month to update the subscription information on the songs already on the phone.<br>  <br>  Of course you can buy the songs if you want to keep them permanently without the subscription or if you want to burn them to a cd.
1aeba656b55eb8ce0d41a7d699ce74d8aa	If you have the ps3 setup for remote play with a psp the fan and your wifi will stay on after you turn off the ps3. If you disable the remote play function the fan and wifi will switch off with the machine.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|wOwHliwjaa	On standby the power supply is still active, You will probably find that the fan is used to cool the power supply & possibly the cpu. The power supply generally generates quite a bit of heat.|`|TSJjQonxaa	Although loads of other people have said it.<br>  I will too lol.<br>  <br>  Its meant to happen to keep your prized console from melting after use and will turn off soon after.<br>  If only microsoft did the same with their design LOL!|`|8L7C3YMWaa	you need to Wait like 3 min and it will turn of |`|JNy144b9aa	All these other comments are pure lies. You have to wait like 2 mins before it actually stops|`|fO5JWKMlaa	when you go into standby some of the internals are still running to keep your exact place where you left off.  so this in turn produces heat, which in turn causes your fan to run.<br>  <br>  |`|lObEjUh1aa	This is normal.  Because the heat built up by the PS3 does not dissipate the moment the console is placed on standby, the fan keeps running to keep air circulating and help cool the unit down.  This makes the components last longer, as heat is a common cause of electrical component failure.<br>  <br>  When you throw the power switch, you are turning off the power supply built into the unit.  This cuts the power signal to all internal circuits (including the fan's power leads), and thus the fan switches off.

yQBjPidGaa	Sometime you have to rescan and or update several times. This sometimes it will reboot.|`|9MZwq04laa	When you say that you have tried several antennas, I take it that you haven't tried a rooftop antenna. Try one if it is an option for you.<br>  Changing the location of your antenna can help tremendously. Get it a clear shot toward the direction of the television station. Try extending the cable on it. Use your converter's signal strength meter as a guide.<br>  Lastly, try another converter box in that location. Not all converter boxes are equal.

JFji7sjqaa	Kilowatts per year is what is asked for. Think it through. Other appliances are rated for kilowatts per hour now that Energy Star products are sold to save energy. Therefore you are most likely to find that rating on televisions. The manufacturer of the product would be the one to contact for this information. Sometimes you can find electrical information on the back of the TV. So then calculate how many hours per year there are.

UfrkVNrgaa	you need to be patient. try pressing the mode button and look at the display. you will see the display change from showing the time to only the hour, minute, month and day. be patient. the display will change until only the hour is displayed. press the start button and the hour display will advance by one hour. when you get to the correct hour, stop. use the mode button again to switch to the minutes display. repeat the process, pressing the start button till you get to the correct value. if you make a mistake, either press the reset button or simply keep pressing the start button till you get the correct figure. sometimes, keeping the button pressed (when you are in the hour, minute, month and day mode) automatically changes the figures and you simply release it when you get the value you want. do the same thing for the date, pressing the mode button till the date is displayed, and another press of the button to display only the month then the day. just be patient, go through the process and eventually, you will be able to do it<br>  hope this helps you
qR4xcTfaaa	Instead of wasting your money on a poorly built lens you will do better to buy a Nikkor Teleconverter which will double all your 55-200mm settings. <br>  Since the D90 is a DX camera 55mm = 82mm, 200mm = 295mm, with a teleconverter it will be 164-590mm equivalent of 35mm cameras. <br>  <br>  The Sigma glass is not bad, a bit warmer than Nikon Nikkor but the lens mechanism is flimsy and garbage, I bought the 70-300mm Macro from Sigma that simply fell apart 2 weeks after I got it, in the middle of a shoot.|`|BUpo8j6Paa	Why do u need a 100-300mm telezoom?<br>  Are you into bird watching or sports photography like surfing, motorboats and such?<br>  To expand your collection of lenses - if you are into sports or wildlife. buy a lens that continues from what you have.. i.e: 400mm and above.<br>  otherwise, the money will be much better used for a really strong sturdy tripod to support the lens you already are using.|`|AFAqILxGaa	The Sigma 100-300 would mostly be just a waste because it mostly duplicates the Nikon lens at the telephoto end (it does go a bit further, I admit).  The beauty of the Nikon lens is that it is a still a strong telephoto and yet can go all the way back to a standard focal length, it has a considerably greater range!  So unless you are a birdwatcher...  That's my thought.

8svzhBAFaa	First of all, congrats on buying the Viewty, I have one and I love it.<br>  <br>  No, the Viewty can't do that as this requires your phone to have a piece of hardware called an accelerometer. That's what the iPhone has which allows it's auto-rotating.<br>  <br>  However, the Viewty does rotate in a few areas of the phone manually.<br>  1. When you are in the internet browser, pressing the second button from the left on the top row will rotate your browser sideways.<br>  2. When you are writing a message, you can press the "A" button up the top and then "Keyboard" to write with a typical computer keyboard sideways.<br>  3. When you are viewing a photo or video (including videos on the internet), tapping the photo will turn it fullscreen sideways.<br>  4. Slide the switch on the side of the phone to the bottom and then press the camera button. This will open a special sideways fullscreen version of your photo and video gallery. Double-tapping a photo or video will open it fullscreen.<br>  <br>  So no, you can't make your Viewty auto-rotate, but some areas of the phone allow you to spin things round yourself.<br>  =)|`|Ot06v8yvaa	if it  is touch screen then yes

Cldtzy5vaa	Only 1 balance board can be used on a system at a time.  This is due to the fact that Nintendo designed the balance board to always connect to the forth Wii remote spot.  Because of this hard wired feature, it is impossible to attach more than one board to a console.  <br>  <br>  If you search, you will find articles about other classrooms that have overcome the problem of one board capability.

My xbox died in the first week of December 06, but i talked it over with the assistant, and they knew it was clarly their fault, and would replace it for me, and i got it before Christmas break, yay! =).  Anyway, talk it over, and if they ask for 140$, let your anger out because when you are under warranty it should be free.

There is one thing you need to understand first: there is nothing like a free PSP download. Of course there are free PSP download sites, but they are illegal and you will be getting into BIG trouble using these services.<br>  <br>  But there are other sites that offer free PSP downloads that are legal. You only have to pay a onetime membership fee. After that you may download as many PSP songs, games, and movies as you can handle forthe rest of your life Membership to these donwload sites is low and varies. You will have to pay around $30 for unlimited access.<br>  <br>  So once you paid your membership fee you have free PSP downloads for life. A pretty good deal and honestly... don't you think it is a good idea to stay legal?|`|9cd7cb4efc80d9142ec108ab4fee0fa1aa	Okay... Anyways.... go to download.com and search psp video converter.

AA11449643	In this world, people want attention. They think they can obtain this in Runnescape by working on their character until they have reached the limit and gain limitless fame in the Runescape community. In reality, they shaved off 2-3 years of their life sitting in front of a computer screen.<br>  <br>  Yes it's true Runescape is notorious for brainwashing people into addictive gamers. However, there are ways to stop yourself.<br>  <br>  Mentally, you can tell yourself everytime you play that if you continue down this path, you will drop out of school or get fired from work and end up freeloading on your parents or worst end up on the streets.<br>  <br>  Financially, you can stop playing the game slowly over time. In the first week, try to play only 3 hours a day and when the week is over, give yourself a dollar or two as a reward. The next week, play only 1.5 hours a day and give yourself a couple dollars at the end of the week. If you fail, then give back all your money to a keeper like ur parents or your bank account and restart the cycle. If you do succeed at the end of 6 months, use your money and go shopping and continue on with the path until Runescape is no more.<br>  <br>  Physically, you can remove the power cable or modem card and store it in a location you do not know or block out the Runescape site using parental controls and have your parents lock it with a password you do not know.<br>  <br>  Hardware speaking, there is a surge arrest device I saw on TV infomercial that shuts your computer down in a specified time adjusted by a password protected program. I forgot the name but go to TV infomercial websites and they should sell it.<br>  <br>  A last option would be psychlogically where you have to go to a psychiatrist and the expert would prescribe you some medication.<br>  <br>  As with all the options stated, it is best to do something else you enjoy to substitute for the time that you used to play Runescape.<br>  <br>  One of the main reasons that people hate Runescape is because they get too attached from the start. The game is infamous for making newcomers addicted. One of the main reasons people go fanatic about Runescape is because it is java-based and is a small program. Players can download the game files onto any computer that is internet-ready in just a few minutes. As a result, players can play at work, at school, at home, or on a laptop.<br>  <br>  This limitless availability to the game makes players lose focus on their daily life routines. The addiction takes over and when these routines are broken, players try to resolve this by playing even more. When they do come out of the habit, players finally realize that they wasted alot of time on Runescape and vent their frustration out against it.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, almost any MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing game) can be addictive if it only requires you to download small files. For example, a MMORPG called Guild Wars requires you to download a 50 megabyte interface before playing it. Surely, no one would take the time to download big files while your supervisor is looking at you during work or school and it would be noticeable to them on the *add/remove programs as well*.<br>  <br>  In conclusion, if you play a game that requires a big installation such as CD games or require high quality graphic cards, you would be less likely to be addicted because you cannot play that much and you can focus on your real life priorities.<br>  <br>  I use to be addicted and near the end i got temporary banned twice. first time for multiple login and it lasted for 3 days. second time i got banned for advertising and that lasted 7 days. after that, they will permanetely ban your account if you break another rule. by that time, i stopped playing.<br>  <br>  Yes I have played Runescape 2 but you don't want to play it. It is an addicting game because of the fact you can play it from any internet-ready computer. Aside from the lack of maturity of people in the game and how everyone is your *friends* to get into your wallet, it gets very repetitive once you get to combat level 60+. At this point, you would probably find yourself subscribing to their membership but it's not worth the 5 dollars USD. You think you have accessed more places to level your character. Then you dream about becoming the next *Zezima* with all 99 stat skills and reap the *imaginary reward* of limitless fame and fortune over the Runescape community. The reality is that this goal is hard to accomplish and you find yourself sitting in front of your computer more often. <br>  <br>  Later, you would find yourself too addicted to detach from the game. Your real life friends would have forgotten about you because you care more about your 5 dollar USD membership than them. You try to fight your addiction by going outdoors and being more social but it's already too late and you seem to not *fit in* whereever you go. Sometimes it is even too hard to play another game because you think the controls and commands are too sophisticated and you give up by reverting back to Runescape primarily because the only control in that game is to click. <br>  <br>  Worst case scenario (at combat lvl 100+), you end up isolated, depressed and do poorly in academics, social relations, or at your employment. You see yourself switching back and fourth from a dirty site to relieve yourself and the game using Alt-F4 because you haven't gotten *any* from a girl in the past 12 months. Your constantly keeping secrets from your parents and family because you don't want them to know your in this deep of a situation. <br>  <br>  In conclusion, the really sick thing about this game is that after all this, you look at your stats and you think that you can still become the next *Zezima* and continue on. <br>  <br>  This is the true realm that is called *Runescape*.|`|781f1b49265b1eed1172c3bab9e54872aa	go outside and get some fresh air|`|AA12078769	its impossible......if ur PSP have internet connection...and can browse internet....and then u can play runescape on it

AA10639444	The above answer is correct - Ipods are simply mp3 players that Apple developed to be prettier and more simple to use. Although not everyone likes them because I believe they require you to use their own software (itunes) and such.<br>  <br>  ipods are alright in the world of mp3 players, but there are better choices - now that other companies have borrowed the intuitive design of the ipod and combined that with the compatibility and ease of use of a regular mp3 player that just shows up as a drive when you plug it in and you can drag and drop files. <br>  that's what I like.<br>  <br>  Your CD player probably plays CD's and reads mp3 files on a data CD. Which could replace regular mp3 players for most people who don't need more than 150 songs (about how many you can fit on one CD).<br>  <br>  but really, <br>  ipods and mp3 players are one and the same. They connect the same way and do the same thing with more or less polish. Those other file formats the person above was talking about are important too (though basically the same as the mp3 file format). If you wanted a new mp3 player you can bet there are better - and cheaper - alternatives to an ipod.|`|AA12097508	iPods are mp3 players created by Apple Corp.

Most First Person Shooters have a split screen multi-player mode. Dynasty Warriors is another multi-player action game.

There is one thing you need to understand first: there is nothing like a free PSP download. Of course there are free PSP download sites, but they are illegal and you will be getting into BIG trouble using these services.<br>  <br>  But there are other sites that offer free PSP downloads that are legal. You only have to pay a onetime membership fee. After that you may download as many PSP songs, games, and movies as you can handle forthe rest of your life Membership to these donwload sites is low and varies. You will have to pay around $30 for unlimited access.<br>  <br>  So once you paid your membership fee you have free PSP downloads for life. A pretty good deal and honestly... don't you think it is a good idea to stay legal?

Another thing, If you didn't get the one with the hard drive take it back and exchange it quickly. It's really going to be bad if the guy get's it and finds he needs to buy a memory card.

With any modification you are at risk of f'ing up your system, because with new updates Microsoft can ban your account from Xbox Live and sometimes it even bricks your system.

pZGLhV2Waa	Your problem is that your shutter speed is way to slow. In order to freeze action you need a shutter speed of at least 1/250th of second. Depending on what lens you are using you may have a tough time getting that shutter speed. What you will need to do is set your aperture to the largest opening (smalles number) Then set your ISO at 800 and see what you can get for a shutter speed. If you still can't get to 1/250 set your ISO to 1600. If you still can't get the 1/250th shutter speed you will have to use a larger aperture lens or do the shot outside in daylight.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	What are you doing inside?<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want a high shutter speed AND a clean pic at low ISO, you need real light.<br>  <br>  with strong sunlight, at ISO 200, you could be looking at 1/1000th shutter speed or better problem solved.<br>  <br>  however, take the camera out of auto mode, put it into aperture priority and open up the lens (smaller number or f-stop) in auto mode, in strong light, the camera can choose f-10 or more and cut out the extra light and setting you right back to where you were.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|HFuI8oVYaa	You will need to use a shutter speed of at least 1/250 seconds or faster. 1/80 will give you lots of motion blur. You may not have enough light in your kitchen to effectively stop motion (you will need light equivalent to outside on a sunny day).<br>  <br>  Another way to stop motion is use the flash. The flash duration on your camera is very short and is effective at stopping motion. Depending on what your camera's sync speed is, try shooting with your flash at a shutter speed around 1/160 to 1/250 seconds (this will give more precedence to the light coming from the flash instead of ambient light).|`|pDcJGptPaa	Flash is a good way to cheat with freeze frame .

AA11417192	Floor Effect pedals are designed to do what you are referring to.<br>  You need to install a jack that has a connection that will open up as you put the power supply in effectively isolating the 9vdc battery supply, when the wallwart is removed the battery is once again the source. This resolves your issue of both being connected at the same time, you can get a jack like this at Radio shack.<br>  You may also want to investigate installing a diode in line with the battery connection to help prevent the scenario where you attempt to put the 9 volt battery in backwards. <br>  As far as how long the battery will last is dependent on how much current the device draws.

If you're worried about it, do some research on the name of the virus and see what it does and/or just take note of the file names infected by the virus. I would think that as long as none of the songs you're planning to sync to the Touch are infected by the virus, you're fine. I don't know what virus program you have, but it should also have a "quarantine" feature which should make any music files on your laptop fine to use if they are infected once you quarantine the virus in those files.

AQ4b4Iilaa	Sony A200 with 18-70mm lens $499.<br>  <br>  Avoid the Nikon D40/D40X/D60, they lack an auto-focus motor in the camera body so you be stuck on manual focus on older Nikon lenses.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	All of the major brands have an entry level model in the $500 range. Look at Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Olympus and Sony.|`|qR4xcTfaaa	You should seriously look in to buying a new D80, it is much more solid than both D60 & D40, it is a PRO level camera and the price just dropped by 33%, it is under $500 with lenses kit.<br>  With the D80 you can use *ALL* NIKON NIKKOR Auto Focus lenses, but with the D40x & D60 you can only use DX lenses. This will prevent you from upgrading in the future to a FX full frame cameras.<br>  <br>  Therefor you should definitely go with the D80 it is very user friendly you will be very happy with it as I am, I guaranty it. <br>  You can buy it on Ebay new with many accessories for less than $500.<br>  <br>  I recommend for you to start with a mid level lens, the lenses that come with the camera are low end;<br>  You must always remember - The LENS is the most important part of the picture, therefor you should invest in mid to high end lenses.<br>  Starting with 24-85mm F2.8/4.0 is a very good serious amateur lens for wide angle(or 24-120mm) this lens is great for Landscape, portrait and micro pictures. Also the 16-85mm. As for Tele Zoom I recommend the 80-200mm F2.8 ED even if you get it used from a good owner (new is almost $1000 or you can get the TOKINA model or TEMRON etc) this lens is great for wild life photography. with these 2 lenses you can not go wrong, the first lens also have a 1:2 Micro capability and since the D40 is a DX camera it will be 1:1.5, this will allow you to get very Very close to a flower or butterfly etc.<br>  The range will be 35-117mm and 117-290mm since they are FX lenses (which also gives you the opportunity in the future to upgrade to an FX camera and then 24mm will be 24mm etc) the GLASS in these lenses are the best of NIKON NIKKOR.|`|fMBREYmNaa	don't buy a nikon d40.

Qui ne se rappelle pas avoir effeuill√© la marguerite cherchant √† vaincre l'affreux doute quant √† l'amour du ou de la bien-aim√©e ? Qui ne se rappelle pas les √©motions du premier amour naissant √† 14, 16 ou 18 ans ? Comment la proximit√© de l'√©lu(e) pouvait nous faire chavirer et r√™ver pendant des heures... avant m√™me de lui avoir adresser la parole ? Nous √©tions en amour avec l'Amour.<br>  <br>  La premi√®re sortie, le premier baiser, la premi√®re promesse, la premi√®re caresse, le premier projet r√™v√© √† deux. Il √©tait tellement merveilleux ; elle √©tait tellement belle ; rien n'existait plus sans lui ; l'avenir n'√©tait pas possible sans elle. Notre amour √©tait pur et √©ternel. Nous transformions le monde, avions les plus beaux enfants et nous vivions heureux. Rien ne pouvait nous arr√™ter. Sauf...<br>  <br>  La premi√®re peine d'amour. Que de pleurs et de sanglots ! Comment a-t-il pu me faire cela ? Jamais je n'aurais imagin√© qu'elle puisse √™tre comme ?a. Quel grand vide cr√©e la premi√®re peine d'amour ! Que de mal au ventre et √† l'estomac la perte de l'√™tre aim√© peut susciter. Quelle d√©prime ! Et juste avant de sombrer compl√®tement, voil√† qu'arrive... un nouvel amour.<br>  <br>  Nous nous rappelons toujours avec nostalgie nos premi√®res amours d'adolescence. Et comment l'apprentissage de l'amour a pu √™tre parsem√© d'emb?ches, mais aussi de plaisirs et de joies indescriptibles. Jusqu'au moment o√π enfin la perle rare arrive et qu'on fasse le grand saut : on se promet de s'aimer toujours, pour le meilleur et pour le pire.<br>  <br>  Cependant, d'apr√®s les statistiques officielles, seulement 2 couples sur 10 confirment la conclusion des romans ou films d'amour: ils se mari√®rent, eurent de nombreux enfant et v√©curent heureux ? Nous connaissons tous des couples complices qui s'aiment depuis leur adolescence, qui ont √©tudi√© ensemble, qui ont de beaux enfants et qui semblent faits pour passer le reste de leur vie ensemble. Mais nous connaissons plus de couples qui, oh ! surprise, ont divorc√©. En fait, 5 mariages sur 10 actuellement, selon les chiffres de l'Organisation Mondiale de la Sant√©, aboutissent au divorce. Et les trois couples qui restent ensemble, pour le meilleur mais surtout pour le pire, ne se parlent plus ou s'engueulent jusque dans les r√©sidences pour personnes ag√©es.<br>  <br>  Qu'est-ce qui fait la r√©ussite des couples qui marchent et passent √† travers les ann√©es ? Y aurait-il une formule magique ou miracle √† la port√©e de tous ? Qu'est-ce qui fait que certains ne semblent jamais avoir de probl√®mes avec leurs amours et que d'autres semblent toujours pr√™ts √† se suicider ou √† d√©primer apr√®s une peine d'amour ? Des gens paraissent heureux, avec ou sans partenaires stables ; d'autres s'accrochent au premier venu ou √† la premi√®re qui ne sait dire non.<br>  <br>  On a beaucoup √©crit sur les difficult√©s de l'amour. Des centaines de livres d√©montrent jusqu'√† quel point l'amour est souvent consomm√© comme une drogue, et √©videmment lorsque la drogue fait d√©faut, arrivent les sympt?mes du manque, physiques et psychologiques.<br>  <br>  Mais qu'est-ce que l'amour ?<br>  On dit que l'amour est une √©motion. Le petit Robert nous dit qu'une √©motion est : un mouvement, une agitation, une r√©action affective, en g√©n√©ral intense. L'amour serait donc un mouvement vers quelqu'un. Comment deux personnes en mouvement, l'une vers l'autre et dans leur vie respective, peuvent-elles faire durer ce mouvement r√©ciproque √† travers les vicissitudes de la vie √† deux ?<br>  <br>  √† mon avis, il existent trois conditions essentielles √† la p√©rennit√© de l'amour : l'admiration, le r√™ve et le d√©sir sexuel. Et ces trois composantes doivent √™tre canalis√©es vers la m√™me personne. Et r√©ciproques. Et stables. Mais pas n√©cessairement dans l'ordre : le d√©sir peut na?tre de l'admiration ou vice-versa.<br>  <br>  Je ne peux aimer quelqu'un que si je l'admire et que je me sente admir√© par ce quelqu'un. L'admiration est un sentiment de joie et d'√©panouissement devant ce qu'on juge beau ou grand (petit Robert). Il n'y a de l'amour que dans le respect. √† partir du moment o√π l'on se crie des b√™tises, on hypoth√®que s√©rieusement l'amour. On peut ne pas √™tre toujours d'accord sur l'√©ducation des enfants, la fa?on de d√©penser l'argent (ce sont l√† les deux principales sources de d√©saccord)..., mais on doit toujours √™tre d'accord sur le fait que l'autre est une personne humaine unique et digne de respect et d'admiration. N'oublions pas que deux amants sont aussi deux ennemis intimes... qui se doivent respect. La baisse de l'admiration est parall√®le √† la baisse de l'amour. D'o√π l'importance de rester debout devant son partenaire.<br>  <br>  Deux personnes qui s'aiment partagent les m√™mes projets, les m√™mes r√™ves ; ce sont deux complices qui complotent ensemble leur avenir : l'achat de la premi√®re maison ou de la premi√®re voiture, l'arriv√©e du premier enfant et des suivants, les succ√®s professionnels de l'un ou l'autre, l'implication sociale, les vacances, la retraite... Encore l√†, les r√™ves individuels ne sont pas n√©cessairement les m√™mes et ne doivent pas n√©cessairement se subordonner aux r√™ves du couple, mais √† partir du moment o√π les r√™ves personnels prennent le dessus, ou encore √† partir du moment o√π je me surprends √† r√™ver avec un(e) autre, la fin du r√™ve commun est proche. Tout couple est bas√© sur deux personnes autonomes poss√©dant leurs propres projets respectifs. S'aimer, c'est r√™ver ensemble de choses possibles.<br>  <br>  √©videmment, l'amour est bas√© sur l'attraction physique mutuelle. Tellement que l'acte d'amour d√©signe les relations sexuelles. Qu'y a-t-il de plus merveilleux que de faire l'amour avec l'√™tre aim√© ? Aimer quelqu'un, c'est vouloir se coller, se toucher, se caresser, s'interp√©n√©trer, se fusionner. Mais, c'est aussi entretenir son d√©sir et le d√©sir de l'autre en conservant une certaine distance. Tu n'es pas moi et ne je suis pas toi. Un plus un ne fait pas un, mais trois, i.e. toi, moi et nous. Les coups de foudre ne peuvent survivre √† la passion, car la fusion totale tue le d√©sir. Je d√©sire seulement ce que je n'ai pas, pas ce que je poss√®de. Tu existes aussi en dehors de moi et j'existe en dehors de toi. La distance est n√©cessaire au d√©sir et permet au rapprochement de se transformer en plaisir.<br>  <br>  Est-ce √† dire qu'une difficult√© sexuelle ou une perte de libido signifie une perte d'amour ? Parfois, mais pas toujours. C'est toutefois un indice qu'il se passe quelque chose chez l'un ou l'autre ou dans la dynamique du couple dont le couple doit s'occuper au plus t?t s'il veut survivre.

You can first listen to music, play games, and watch videos.

It has the best graphics of all at 2 trillion pixels per second and runs at blu-ray technology (5x better than HD-DVD the one used on Xbox 360). Then has SIX-AXIS controller where say you were riding a dragon you can move your controller to move the dragon, you can drive a car by pointing the controller down and brake by pointing it up.

The next way to decide is how much fun you will have playing it. The best choices are the xbox 360 and the wii because either will provide what you want. The ps3 cost to much money for what the the xbox 360 will have plus all the extra money you spend on blu-ray movies. For online gameplay, the xbox 360 would be better because xbox live is amazing, and the online for ps3 is not so great. For my decision the xbox 360 would be th best to buy of the three, but whatever you buy I'm sure you will be happy. Hope this helps.Good luck.|`|AA10639444	The PlayStation 3 wins the competition based on number of titles, backwards compatibility with previous PlayStations and just by virtue of being a high-powered, convergence technology smorgasbord. There will be great titles for the PS3 because there are so many developers and so much competition.<br>  <br>  However, for the money, most people don't need a high-powered convergence machine. They just want an innovative game console. So I guess when you're talking about game consoles exclusively and taking price into consideration, then your choice has to be the WII.<br>  <br>  I think most others are right in not choosing the Xbox 360. It won't have as many titles as the PS3. It's high powered, yet buggy - trying to be what the PS3 masters. Both the PS3 and xbox 360's high definition capabilities mean nothing to most people who have yet to even acknowledge what high definition visually means as far as video quality. And who cares about   high definition compared to things that actually make games fun? like gameplay and innovation.<br>  <br>  you'll like whatever you buy :)|`|AA12010983	I have all three (PS3, X-box 360 and the Nintendo Wii).

It is in a completely different league from the 360 and the PS3 because it's not a techno super machine. It's fun.  you move to play the game, you don't just sit on your butt and push buttons. the only downfall is the graphics, but I'm not one to care that much about that.<br>  The PS3 is a good choice for: people that have or like PS2s, people that have PSPs, people that like free online gameplay, and people that are interested in blu-ray (and one of those usually costs about $1000)  I think the games will get better overtime as did the PS2.<br>  The Xbox 360 is a good choice for: people that want a system NOW,people that like or have xboxs, people that have high def TVs, or people that want HD DVDs.<br>  My pick, Wii and PS3.

For example, Future Shop just got another 1500 units in yesterday. Of course, they were gone in an hour.<br>  Best Buy Canada got 1200 units last Friday. Sold out in about the same amount of time.<br>  The point is, these 2 dealers knew these were coming and put signs up telling their customers how many were coming and when.<br>  For the record, Future Shop also just received 2400 Playstation-3s.|`|AA10929820	I called Nintendo and asked that question, according to them, it will be available easily after Christmas, and supposedly there won't be as much shortages because most people are getting them for Christmas presents.|`|c83148f74ed83ca3086fcc33c2382e36aa	if you really want one now, check out ebay. they have a lot of suprisingly cheap bundles that i saw today. <br>  as a side note, my bf and i waited in line all night sat and got a wii-- it is amazing! i love it, i highly recommend it!! i want to get one for myself after xmas, which i heard a rumor that they will be upgraded to play dvds and be $50 cheaper
a8e272cca57f832dd352638e16d03f08aa	Because it seems like 75% of the morons who bought it retail only purchased it to resell for at least 2X the price they paid.  If you take these people out of the equation there probably was more than enough PS3s and Wii to go around for the holidays.<br>  <br>  Personally I refuse to go through ebay or anywhere else and pay anything more than retail since this only gives validation to what these people are doing.<br>  <br>  If you can wait a little while and the shelves will likely be filled with them.|`|2fe507c7189aef5fbe6fa50a5a8b3adfaa	I would not get one. None of the new consoles have shown anything that great. I was tempted to get a new console, but all of them just have to many problems. Anyways, blue ray, which ps3 uses is not going to become popular, so it is a waste of money.|`|a11750087e1ac57ed6db82820d0ded65aa	well today the 22nd, a bunch of places like toys r us and walmart and pretty much any other place is supposed to be havein them in stock, so just go all around today as soon as possible and you might get lucky
d7f8b5cb837763649eab2c6e90c36033aa	Try to plug your ipod back into the usb cable and then open itunes.  On the left hand side of your itunes window hit the eject button for your ipod.  Sometimes disconnecting it that way will unfreeze it.  Sometimes if you just hold the play button (aka off) down for a few seconds and then click menu and then try the play button again it will shut down if you play back and forth with it for a little bit.|`|3ca2fafb859521c28fc6fa6f54821992aa	dump your ipod get a Zune|`|781f1b49265b1eed1172c3bab9e54872aa	take to an apple store.|`|AA10730063	use this site to guide you through getting your ipod back on.<br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/ipod/five_rs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/support/ipod/five_r...</a>

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Gameplay:  Depends on you.  If you like RPG, then PS3.  If you like FPS, then 360.<br>  <br>  Graphics:  Hard to tell.  Technically, the PS3 is capable of better graphics, but it's still in the first generation, so it's going to be at least a year before we see 2nd generation PS3 graphics. <br>  <br>  Online play:  easy, the 360, hands down.<br>  <br>  Games:  Quantity:  360 now, PS3 in the future (pure speculation, but it seems like most Japanese developers are supporting the PS3 because the 360 isn't doing too well in Japan).<br>  <br>  Formats:  PS3 because it's the only next gen console to support any kind of next gen formats.  The HD-DVD add on for the 360 is only for watching movies, not for games.|`|a11750087e1ac57ed6db82820d0ded65aa	game play, pretty much a tie to me<br>  <br>  graphics, goes to 360 right now<br>  <br>  online play, a toss up, live is very user freindly and has lots of stuff to do, the ps3 online stuff doesnt have uch to do but its free, and resistence has 40 player online<br>  <br>  games, 360 for now it has lots more games witch means they have more good ones<br>  <br>  formats, blu-ray as 360 games are still on dvd, as actually movies i cant judge as i havent watched either format|`|274ed7dbc88c27614d42f177ffc117b6aa	if u going to buy camera - buy Sony , if u toking about games talk Microsoft.

Plus the ps3 takes up more space than the 360 and is more expensive.

This will free up memory and perhaps the installation would proceed as intended.

Mp3, program, Video, etc.<br>  <br>  # is number, I guess.<br>  So even if Limewire is free, sometimes it contains Adware to pay for it and they could take your info and send it to 3rd parties.<br>  Viruses could basically "kill" your PC, and spyware tracks your history which is downright BAD. So, I'd suggest you buy the videos instead, or get them from Youtube because it is much more safer, and most importantly, legal.<br>  <br>  As for bit rate, it's the no. of bits processed per unit of time.|`|c973c378f735dfed2883c36ade989317aa	ok first off, you cant get a virus through a movie file.. only executable and batch files which may some packaged with a movie, which you of course would not run. so yeah, limewire away and im sure there will be plenty of decent ipod movies!|`|374c73d4896ff2bff1e292087536a461aa	i have no clue i dont trust limewire for movies... # i belive is how many people that have it that are online that you can downlode frm.. junk rating is the more if its junk or not(LOL) bitrate i think if i am thinking right and i dont wanna open limewire up is how big it is..i think...type i think is what form it is frm those host... i dont usaly look at the bitrate ..junkrating..or type..lol i just see how many people i can get it frm for a faster downlode|`|3f0570dba81953b8c598fbf67afdb14eaa	sure you can...   just look at the stars on the left side of the songs you are serching for... if it has 4 stars...   there would be no problem...<br>  <br>  I got my songs from limewire too....<br>  <br>  Take Care !
a3a422bc6a1c8016190505b931b3c300aa	I have the same mp3 player and had this problem when I ended my subscription with Napster.  The program I download with sometimes has songs with some type of protection that will not sync, but I can usually just download the song again and it will work.<br>  <br>  In Media Player it will tell you why the song did not sync.  When you "sync", it should syncrinize all the songs in Media Player with the songs on your mp3 player.
9627200349775368bb96c685a64b7d56aa	I actually own both and have found the PS2 to be better.  I like both units but in order to find games for the gamecube either you need to go to gamestop or ebgames to have a decent selection.  Alot of the games available for gamecube are also available for ps2 and at a lower price as well.  Most of the good nintendo games are available on GBA and in order to use these you must purchase a gameboy player for the gamecube.  Upon researching this, I found it ranges from $50-$110 on E-Bay.|`|73dce300bea6aeccdadacd97c8b3e99baa	PS2 depending on your age.  GameCube is just too kiddy.|`|48f6414abb2ba23ecfc54d1cdb3fc6c4aa	It depends.  Check out the games available for each.  PS2 will have more audlt oriented games (Grand Theft Auto, Socom, etc) while the GC has things like Mario Brothers and other fun, addictive games geared toward the whole family.<br>  <br>  GC does not support online play, PS2 has excellent online play for the games that support it.|`|AA11863658	PS2.|`|edfd3645c902d0ef23a0893a7efd35adaa	ps2 by far theres more games the graffics are better i got a game for ps2  and it was one of the best games  i have ever played
AA11547859	Its based on how many have been sold and how long they have been out.|`|d70e7c74f5a077f2f61efeea81dea568aa	It is based of how many sales it has.
73dce300bea6aeccdadacd97c8b3e99baa	The PS3 it has a ton more features plus it is the only HD gaming device.  Since the 360 was rushed out to beat the PS3 launch they used regular DVD's instead of the HD DVD's they promised.  The PS3 uses Blueray for gaming plus it can play blueray movies.  It can also play all of the PS2 games which allows it to play regular DVD's.  If you want all of that in the 360 you will have to spend another $200 to get the HD DVD addon.  Plus if you have or will eventually get a PSP you can use it as a second controler, a different gaming view, or you can download PS1 games to put on your PSP. The 360 doesn't have any of that.  The PS3 is far superior the two might look close now but look ahead 3 years down the line.  The tech in the PS3 is going to blow your mind while the 360 will be stuck in the past.|`|1459355fa50e39bbb8c933cc164b84ebaa	hi i am looking at the same thing so i know how confusing this can be. if u decide to get the 60gb ps3 it wil be 3 times more powerful then the xbox 360. i have also heared on tv that the ps3 has 5 times better graphics. and the main thing that made me decide to get the ps3 is the new blueray technology in the ps3. ill explain this. dvds made the vhs(video tapes) heaps better now blue ray is doing this to the dvd and making dvds better. it is said u need a high definition tv to get the most out of the ps3 however it is still great on a normal tv. overall i would choose the ps3 but i suggest u spend a day reasearch them both try and find articles, gamesworld, microsoft,sony, xbox360 vs ps3. i hope this info has helped u.|`|3038bd572dff7294ba78cfd3b8819816aa	im sorry bowslinger2004 but you need to check facts. im a playstation fanboy and even i know that the ps3 is better than xbox 360 but it depends on want you want. if you want high quality gaming, amazing media features, and fabulous internet quality, go with 360. but for one that takes all of that and magnifies it a little, go with ps3. i personally think that the battle will be between these two and that the 360 WILL NOT be in the past. no offense but thats not logical. either way, ps3 is very good and so is xbox 360. research A LOT before you buy either.|`|40680d679b0c4f771b74d01376e1bb50aa	The ps3 is truley more better but i would judge the two on the games you like the most because of the major price difference|`|5941444ee50246d379120d56e9c9a90aaa	360 is not total crap but PS3 has some really good games but it's Bluetooth wireless controllers sometimes have a random connection failure. but 360 has alot of war/shooting games if you want those. so it is hard to decide. my answer is Wii (although it's almost impossible to get)|`|AA11696316	Well, what do you look for in a system.<br>  <br>  Thats whats important, these guys are morons. Tech talk BS, its more about the gaming experience.<br>  <br>  As known, the 360 has a better online service(the reason I got it) but do some research on the games coming out for each console. Figure out which games will suit you better as a gamer, and buy the console that will have them.|`|b0a60a397f4a560640b5c10c4651e02baa	ok. firstly, both consoles have 2 varying packages, a 'basic', and a 'full/premium' package. for this comparison ill use both premium packages.<br>  <br>  similar graphics and power.<br>  <br>  both use wireless controllers. the ps3 can connect up to 7 controllers, and the xbox360 can connect 4<br>  <br>  both have online mode, however xbox live is a subscription based service at roughly Ôø°39.99 per year. whereas ps3's online service is free. both enable you to play your games online (if the feature is part of the game) and both have downloadable demos, videos and content. xbox360 requires an ethernet cable to connect to the internet, but ps3 can use a wireless network.<br>  <br>  in terms of storage the ps3 has an upgradeable 60GigaByte hard disk drive and 3 types of memory stick (portable media storage used in digital cameras, the psp, mobile phones...etc...) slots to transfer data to and from. whereas the xbox360 has a 20GigaByte hard disk drive (HDD) 2 memory card slots (for use only with xbox360 specific memory cards, like what the ps2 and xbox used), however it has the ability to connect to a desktop pc, or notebook, for tranfering data...etc...<br>  <br>  in terms of connectivity the ps3 has 6 usb2.0 connections (standard usb connection) for use with digital cameras, the psp, headsets, microphones, keyboards, and mice...etc...  whereas xbox360 has 4 usb2.0 connections, with similar connectivity.<br>  <br>  the ps3 uses a new type of disk called the blu-ray disk, which can hold about 54GigaBytes of data, and is coated in a material about as hard as diamond, so scratching the disk doesn't necesarily mean loss of data/skipping/jumping. whereas the xbox360 uses a dual layered dvd disk, which holds a maximum of 8GigaBytes of data. though both consoles will play the standard dvds and cds, the extra space on a blu-ray disk allows for 'high definition' resolution (if your tv is HD ready, the picture will be made up of up to 1080 lines, instead of the standard dvds 480 lines) which essentially means an incredibly clear picture for both games and movies, straight out of the box (xbox360 requires an additional purchase of a HD-DVD drive for about Ôø°140 in order to play movies in high definition)<br>  <br>  in terms of games the ps3 (as it has just been released) has the launch games available which range from a variety of sports games to shooting, racing, flying, rpg (role playing games) and action. with most of these been franchises seen running through the ps2, such as Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy, Gran Turismo and Resident Evil. however the best rated release game has been a newcomer in the form of the first person shooter Resistance: Fall of Man.<br>  <br>  the xbox360, on the other hand, has a much longer list of games, having been out much longer, ranging accross almost all genres. however, it is often said of the xbox360 (much like the pc) that much of this list is made up of a multitude of first person shooters, such as the critically acclaimed game Gears of War. similarly to the ps3's ps2 franchises, Project Gotham Racing and Halo will also return on the xbox 360.<br>  <br>  though one of the biggest differences between these consoles may be the prices:<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 Premium Package: $399<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 Premium Package + HD DVD Player: $598<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 Premium Package + HD DVD Player + Wireless Network Adapter: $697<br>  <br>  PS3 Premium Package: $699
AA12097508	Turn it off, reinstall the battery and turn it back on that should do the trick|`|0e8388423ced2d02c017fafde4f15141aa	umm... what the first guy said
AA12097508	Unplug it, then turn it off and then back on,,,should work|`|3d291501c7b6d3c3ffbfcf93aaf0bd93aa	Unplug your iPod from your computer.

You see, each of the systems has something or things that are good about them.  Like the 360 and it's online play, the PS3's power and games, or the Wii's fun games and multiplayer games.  The new systems aren't quite the same as the older ones, now it's just which one do YOU want to play.|`|AA11281315	i prefer the wii|`|DUX8hINhaa	No.  For the price you might as well get an Xbox 360 if you are looking for graphics.  If you do not believe that Xbox 360 graphic capabilities are the exact same as the PS3 than go to google and type in Xbox 360 Vs. PS3.|`|947ad70e3087cb09729225cc4a08693baa	I perfer my xbox 360 over my ps3 online game play and achievement point to me are more entertaining me then no achievement points ps3 has blue ray but you can rent hd movies online with xbox 360 which offers so much more in game play and ease of use and now supports hd drives which is actually doing better than blue ray<br>  <br>  WII is fun but looks horrible on hd tv's|`|861b9d73cd8122a7ac88fb1cff5a844caa	No according to ratings the WII is the BOMB
381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	First off, there is no such thing as 720i in the US.  It's either 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i, or 1080p.  The 360 can support up to 1080p, but so far, there are no games on the 360 that is made in 1080p.  The PS3 can support up to 1080p, and NBA 07 does support 1080p.<br>  <br>  I have the game, and the graphics is great.  It's not as good as Gears of War, but then again, you're comparing PS3 launch graphics vs. 360 2nd gen graphics.  Resistance is much better than any 360 launch games, graphic-wise.  <br>  <br>  I think you should buy it because I still believe that it is the only good game for the PS3, excluding other games that have appeared on other consoles, such as Fight Night Round 3 and Marvel Ultimate Alliance.  Fight Night Round 3 is a great game, but if you already have it for the 360, why bother getting it on the PS3.|`|78a005282d4140d1f22474ec24ec5965aa	First off I have every system....that includes old ones...Resistance is a awesome game right up there with Halo....The graphics are the same as 360 except for HD in which XBOX can use 1080i and so far PS3 can only right now support 720i so that being the only downfall....but if you don't have HD TV then it doesn't matter other than that Resistance is a awesome game but, to have great graphics on any system you need HD nowadays|`|VAqoKq2vaa	well i dont have a playstation but i played my friends play station two and the graphics depend on the game. however, the graphics on the ps3 arent that good|`|f83a9615bc0ef1f6cd59921394079254aa	The graphics are okay, I say if anything, they're MAYBE a little bit better than Halo 2. They are NOT even close to Gears Of War. And the gameplay is really repetitive.
e084a5e91600a7cdc1c4dffee1ce4eedaa	Yes, you're going to have to buy a special cable.  You can find these at just about any game store or Wal-Mart.com.|`|MRgLUCYsaa	a few companies make a cable with an addititional port instead of one.  check a few sites online like bestbuy or circuitcity and see.  MAKE sure they say licenced by xbox or microsoft on them or they wont work properly|`|nGkOar9daa	Get a fourth x box and try to link.
AA11078792	did u try to reset the ipod that usually works|`|5fd3692928eab96b5a98d2e85ee88e3aaa	My guess is, if you're using USB, you are plugging your iPod into a USB 1.1 port or you're plugging it in wrong, or you're plugging it into a USB port that is on your peripherals, like the keyboard. This usually doens't work. You need to find a high-powered USB port on you're computer. If you are using FireWire, I probably can't help you.|`|e084a5e91600a7cdc1c4dffee1ce4eedaa	I've had this problem with my Nano, when I switched computers.  You have to reset your iPod.  This doesn't take long though.
350e32fde9d8050f28b8c9651cadbbf2aa	The disk might have a scratch or two on it or you might need to clean the system from dust.|`|AA12097508	its full of dust or its overheated, give it a break...|`|dfIxZtgEaa	ugh, I have some bad news for you.  Mine did the same thing, it is the lens of the dvd drive.  I had to send it out to microsoft, and they fixed it for me.  The only good thing is that even though it was not under warranty anymore, they still repaired it for free, I just had to pay for shipping.
e084a5e91600a7cdc1c4dffee1ce4eedaa	Ignore "Adam".  It's not your fault that you apparently have better game taste than him.<br>  <br>  But yes, I'm definitely looking forward to Halo 3, as well as Gears of War 2, as well as a future installment of Quake.|`|2984f8da86304ebd8eac9861144fa1f2aa	yea i already reserved halo 3 and i cant wait  well adam is wrong|`|5bbb71a35e3f9d80e37c0316f22b140caa	you have problems if you get excited over a video game, especially if you are a girl.

741e900ec90636ae765dba8e3ca6dceaaa	I dont think the SPH-A640 uses a memory card, but if it does it should have a small port on the side that says microflash.|`|cef08bfd48e21604dc1b05dfdb96b811aa	read the manual|`|TzrypQ7saa	In case you haven't read your manual or searched the net, it doesn't have a SD slot anywhere.<br>  Sorry
1fRj5V6Aaa	The reason the PSP got bricked is because the system memory got corrupted or erased.  Below are the ways to brick your PSP:<br>  <br>  1) Attempt to downgrade the PSP and something when wrong (i.e. not enough battery charge when you downgrading)<br>  2) Try to run homebrew programs that are malicious (virus) or badly written<br>  3) Try to mess around with the system memory yourself (i.e. change XMB icon or Gameboot)<br>  <br>  Other than that, you will not brick your PSP during normal use.
1fRj5V6Aaa	You may bricked your PSP.  Sorry.|`|YKESMxo9aa	do u mean u switch on ur psp but nothing happen then the green light flashing? if yes u brick ur PSP as in it is SPOIL cant be use!
1fRj5V6Aaa	Upgrade to 3.03 then downgrade to 1.5 from there.  However, you need unpatched version of Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories.  <br>  <br>  Also, not sure it will work on TA-082.
9cd7cb4efc80d9142ec108ab4fee0fa1aa	Sorry just checked and there is no way of doing this unless you have 2.80. BUT, the good news is that you can upgrade your psp to 3.03 then downgrade it to 1.5 then up grade it to 2.80 where you can  use eloader to execute EBOOT files. Sounds confusing I know. LOL check this place out <br>  <br>  noobz.eu and also www.psp3d.com <br>  <br>  good luck|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	But you still need unpatched GTA to go from 3.03 to 1.5.
up8fQXdkaa	4GB. i heard its comin out soon. or either its out and i just don't know wheres its at.<br>  <br>  ya and if you notice in the beginning of that psp commercial where that guy is trying to find his girlfriend hes holding a 4GB memory stick.|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	Currently, the biggest memory stick is 4 Gig, the street price is about $80-$100.  Amazon has it for $78.95.<br>  <br>  An 8 Gig memory stick is coming out in near future.  But the price tag is about $300 - $400.|`|2b24fe0179c102ccf3bf0cf5d19ccb77aa	the 4 gig is avaliable now or should be soon. next year sony plans to release a 8 gig. and then the year after that a 16 gig. Sony has big plans for the memory stick. It looks like it will be massively expensive for a while|`|AA11175055	Ebay.  I have a 2GB. I've heard rumor about a 4GB.
1fRj5V6Aaa	Why do you need another PSX emulator when you have 3.03oe-a?  It already has Sony's PSX emulator built in. <br>  <br>  Also, you need popstation to convert your bin to eboot.  Use popstation GUI.  It's much easier to use.

1fRj5V6Aaa	No.  There is no downgrader available for 3.10.|`|AA11887607	you can't run homebrew on version 3.10.... sorry...
fMJFTqX9aa	Yeah ebay is your best bet unless you want to go through EBgames or Gamespot and find the unpatched version (not sure if you can tell by the box or not though).  I have one though :)|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	Ebay.  Current price is about $40-$50.
9cd7cb4efc80d9142ec108ab4fee0fa1aa	No not really, downgrading just enables you to add other homebrew that 2.8 and higher do not support. All I use is 2.8 with eloader.|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	You can downgrade to 1.5 then upgrade to any Open Editions by Dark Alex (latest one is 3.10 OE-A).  That's the only way to play downloaded games.
1fRj5V6Aaa	Your PSP must be homebrews enabled.  For PS1 games, your PSP must be either in 3.03 OE or 3.10 OE.<br>  <br>  If you don't know what I'm taking about, I don't recommend you try it.  Because the process is very risky and can turn your PSP into a worthless piece of junk.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.psp-hacks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.psp-hacks.com/</a>

If your PSP is not firmware version 1.5, you need to "downgrade" it.  However, since you are new at this, I strongly don't recommand you to do that becase if you make mistake, you can make your PSP unusable.

1fRj5V6Aaa	First of all, in order to run emulator, your PSP has to be homebrew enabled.  This means your PSP has to be downgraded to version 1.50 first.<br>  <br>  When you said the latest software, which version you are talking about.  If you have anything higher than 3.03, you are out of luck because currently there is no way to downgrade to 1.50 with those version.<br>  <br>  Also, downgrading your PSP is a risky business, if you don't do it correctly you will make your PSP unusable.|`|8bbf3d5ef2fbd474d0f0fa41c5ea1ca6aa	keep searching on the net im sure your find it eventually and as for mr legal above if it makes you feel better snes is no longer made so whats the big deal|`|Q9eRFErlaa	You do realize emulators are illegal.

They both have a lot of the same games this late in their lifetimes, so you'll probably be happy with either one, but just let those little differences in the game library make your decision.|`|d01d3dd0ca7264e2df09a389fbeba64faa	It depends on which games you like really...<br>  Ps2 has more titles than xbox, yet I kind of like xbox better.<br>  You may just want to take account of all the games you want of each and see which one has more.|`|e4b203b912e133f26defdc5743879da2aa	Man, buy an XBOX 360 or a Playstation 3.

AA12264849	the only difference is the 3.10 OE is capable of running home-brew applications with all the features of the latest firmware wheres as the 1.5 an run home-brew and that's about it you have to use a loader to play games that require higher firmware i use 3.03 OE c just because i see no reason to upgrade yet but once he makes another one i will upgrade dark_Alex is the man|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	Not to mention that 3.00 and above has Sony's PS1 emulator built in.

You only have to pay a onetime membership fee.

AA11290955	No , that's not possible . Alternatively you can offload games from your computer onto a  memory stick .

550647d9a856ea6fe92a7f2a162856aaaa	I downgraded my PSP a while ago.  Whenever you do anything related to firmware on your PSP, there is a partial chance of brickage, but, if you follow ALL the directions in the downgrader and give yourself plenty of time to do what you need to do, you will not brick your PSP.  Most people who brick their PSP didn't do it right.  Also if you ever are interested in homebrew DONT UPGRADE TO SONY's FIRMWARES, otherwise if you are just interested in gmes and music, dont worry about it.<br>  <br>  You should downgrade and then upgrade to the 3.03 OE-C firmware.  It can do anything a 1.50 can and much more.<br>  <br>  Also If you want to know why PSP's brick, It is because something is wrong with one of the onboard flash drives which are very sensitive.  If they get messed up you cannot boot your PSP.  This presents a MAJOR advantage if using custom firmare like 3.03 OE-C because it lets you run a recovery program and acess the memory stick and flash drives from USB without booting the firmware.  An exmple is when I was trying to change the theme of my XMB I screwed it up and my PSP wouldn't boot but in the recovery menu I loaded the program that flashed and fixed it without booting my PSP|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	You need to downgrade to 1.50 and the get the Dev Hook for 2.06.  <br>  <br>  If you downgrade to 1.50 then upgrade to 2.06, it will not have the ability to run homebrew.  And the ability to run homebrew in 1.50 is the key for using any cheat device.<br>  <br>  However, I wouldn't do that if I were you becaue you will brick your machine if you don't know what you are doing.|`|66ebfa3a074dfa5af3641050b98289f0aa	ive herd it can really mess it up and possibly brick it so its best not to i herd of making the O.S custom so it can do the cheats<br>  <br>  havent even bought my memory stick yet so dont bet ur life on my answer  but ive read a bunch of people saying that itll mess it up and brick it
1fRj5V6Aaa	You have to use a PS3 in order to active it.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a PS3, you will need to install a custom firmware on your PSP (3.03 OE-c).

cfd3f494b5438e1203ef4f11e3788f68aa	First you gotta downlgrade your psp to FW1.50 or FW2.71.<br>  Next install devhook into your psp which allows you to use iso/cso files.<br>  From the USB Mode, drop your files in the iso file|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	In order to run iso files, your PSP has to be homebrew enabled by downgrading your PSP to firmware 1.50.  But there is no way for 3.11 firmware to be downgraded to 1.50.

1fRj5V6Aaa	Do you have a mod chip installed in your machine?  I remember there are some PS1 games will detect the machine to see if they have a mod chip.  If they found one, they will not run.|`|6028e4c8ae04e5a973a31a79018311ebaa	go to the customer from where you brought and tell him to repair or sell it or exchange it r repair it . the problem is the lens is duplicate . go to the shop and buy a new lens and u have put a bad CD or you have played more than 3 hours thats why .  choose me for best answer if you want
1fRj5V6Aaa	In order to have a downgrader, hacker need to find a security hole in the firmware so that they can exploit it to create a downgrader.  So far, they have not find anything in 3.11.<br>  <br>  But don't be dispair, Sony just released version 3.30, and hopefully they can find security hole in there (just like 3.03 where Sony inadvertently put back a old security hole people can exploit).|`|qjnSnsxuaa	There have been downgraders for almost every other version. And if not downgraders, there's always modchips and what not so you can flash your PSP to a different version to continue running Homebrew and Emulators. I wouldn't be too concerned about 3.11

In order to be homebrew enabled, your PSP has to be downgrade to version 1.50.<br>  <br>  For 3.03 PSP, you will need an unpatched copy of GTA Liberty City Stories (UMB) in order to downgrade to version 1.50.<br>  <br>  Isn't that funny, in order to play your GTA: LTC, you need a copy of GTA: LTC.

They cost anywhere from 20 to 45 dollars and they come with instructions and headphones.<br>  <br>  The best Ipod is probably the Ipod Nano (Newer Version).  They hold a lot of songs (about 200 or so), they are stylish, and they come in many colors.

1fRj5V6Aaa	An emulator allows games of one system to be played on other system.  In addition to the emulator, you'll need to get the games in order to play (most of them stores as ROM or ISO files).<br>  <br>  The best N64 emulator for PSP is Daedalus.  However, it's still not a very good emulator and can only play few games.<br>  <br>  In addition, because the emulator is a homebrew program, your PSP need to be homebrew enabled in order to use it.  This means, you most likely will need to downgrade your PSP.  Downgrading your PSP is very risky and can turn your PSP completely useless.<br>  <br>  To superdork: I also know no one cares your rants & raves.

AA10093256	What happens when you go back and look at the song in the playlist later?  Are the changes still there, or did the song revert to it's original info?  If the song has reverted back, it could be that the MP3 file is "read-only."  You can check that by finding the file on your hard drive and then checking it's properties.  (Normally the boxes to make changes are greyed out on read-only tracks, but I think previous versions of iTunes didn't do that.)<br>  <br>  Windows:  Right click on the file, choose "Properties" in the menu that opens.  You'll see a checkbox for "Read-only"<br>  <br>  Mac: Ctrl-Click on the file, choose "Get Info" from the menu.  In the box that opens, you'll see an "Ownership & Permissions:" choice.  (Click the arrow beside it if you don't see more detail.)<br>  <br>  If this isn't your problem, maybe your iTunes installation is corrupt.  Maybe try reinstalling it, with the latest version from Apple.  Your library should stay intact when you do this, so you're not risking much.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|AA10084471	I always change the info prior to using the song in a playlist or loading it on the ipod, so I can't be sure --<br>  <br>  but try making the changes on the song in the lIbrary -- the library seems to take precedence over the playlists when issues of deletion are involved, anayway.|`|AA10406797	It is on your file properties.

1fRj5V6Aaa	First of all, there is direct downgrade from 2.0 to 1.50.  You do not need to do any upgrade nor need to use any GTA to downgrade your PSP.<br>  <br>  That's said, let me point out that downgrading is very risky especially for people who are technologically challenged.  If you make any mistake, your PSP will not be usable again (they call it bricked).  If I were you, I will not do the downgrade myself.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can ask someone who can do that for you, or you can buy a PSP that are downgraded in Ebay.  If you plan to by a PSP already hacked, may I suggest you should get one with custom firmware 3.03 OE-c or 3.10 OE-a.  Custom firmware can run homebrews and new games without doing lot of extra set up (1.50 does).|`|168ef4e6b2fd36b30f594fa9b65c7164aa	why would you want to downgrade it thats bad|`|9cd7cb4efc80d9142ec108ab4fee0fa1aa	Downgrading is risky especially if you don't know what your doing. read more about it here <a href="http://qj.net/" rel="nofollow">http://qj.net/</a> its the best.

nay7AO3Daa	Cell phone viruses are uncommon and you likely do not have one. What you need to do is try a reboot (shut down, take out battery, wait 5 mins, put battery back in, restart). IF that doesn't work try a Master reset (most phone manuals will tell you how). That usually solves most phone problems

1fRj5V6Aaa	In order to do this mod, you have to replace files in the PSP's system memory.  Unless you have a homebrew enabled PSP, you cannot access PSP's system memory.<br>  <br>  If you do have a homebrew enabled PSP, there are homebrews that allow you access PSP system memory via USB port.  Also, if you have custom firmware 3.03 OE-c, you can also access the system memory via USB port using recovery menu.<br>  <br>  Finally, messing with system memory is highly dangerous and can make your PSP completely useless.

1fRj5V6Aaa	There are two ways to do it.<br>  <br>  The first way (legal) is to use a PS3 to purchase PS1 games online and download them to your PSP.<br>  <br>  The second way (illegal) is to install a custom firmware (3.03 OE-c) on your PSP that will allow you to put PS1 game rom into your PSP.  This way is very difficult to do it yourselves.  It's very technical and very risky.<br>  <br>  PS: PSP Blender is a scam.  All the software there are illegal and cannot run on your PSP unless your PSP is hacked. Do not do it.|`|f26a19646711d7ba81e22aec2593b7f5aa	the only way i know how is if you join www.pspblender.com . they have lots of cool psp, gameboy, and ps1 games. you pay a 1 time lifetime access fee, and i recommend atleast a 2GB memory stick pro duo(the high speed ones are cheaper)to put your downloads on, and a usb cable for you psp.
1fRj5V6Aaa	Yes.  <br>  <br>  Full length movie is about 400Mb - 700Mb<br>  <br>  Game files size veries, UMD can store up to 1.8 Gig of data.  So for game can run between 100 MB - 1.8 Gig.  ISO can be compressed into smaller size file.|`|7ce8b867e07a5d9682e2d6ec9101e5a9aa	Well it depends on the size of the movie or game you are trying to put on your PSP, the longer the movie is, the more space its going to take. It usually takes about 700mb. Also keep in mind that you have to convert your movies to a specific file format like MP4. I know some friends that have software to convert files and after conversion it could take up more space so pay attention at what you're doing.|`|t8dpSjudaa	Yes, you can. I have done it with my own PSP and it works very well. If you store a full length movie though, there is not going to be a lot of space for the games. But yes, this does work. Have fun! :]

If you have a media plan, there's a set rate for a certain amount of data in one month. If you don't have a data plan, then the charge is based on how many KB you download at a time.

1fRj5V6Aaa	Actually, you don't need mod chip to play games from other countries because PSP games are region free.<br>  <br>  The main purpose of the mod chip (it calls Undiluted Platinum chip) is to allow PSP to play homebrews and fix bricked PSP.|`|VzceFhGFaa	depends on what kind of mod chip it is. there are mod chips for psp that let u play japanese games or from another country. there are some where wen u play online, u can cheat by modifying (or customizing) your own cheats when you play online. It basically gives u power to modify anything on a psp. Note: IT COULD MESS UP YOUR PSP BADLY BY NOT TURNING ON PERMINATELY OR WORSE!!
1fRj5V6Aaa	No.  Not yet.  It will take a while for people to find any security holes in 3.10.<br>  <br>  I think it just easier for you to sell your 3.10 and buy one already downgraded.
cfd3f494b5438e1203ef4f11e3788f68aa	It may vary. So its best to wait for the latest downgrade program. But remember when downgrading you can avoid bricking as much as possible.<br>  Bricking can occur when the user has the incorrect motherboard type. Meaning each PSP has different motherboard types. I have the TA-079 type (the older version) and the newer psp has the TA-082 to TA-089 type.<br>  Another possibility is the shortage of power during the downgrading process. So keep your battery charged at least 75% or greater.<br>  Another possibility is when you forget to install HEN before downgrading. Installing HEN takes time so dont worry if it dosnt work for the first time.<br>  The last possibility of bricking is the downgrading software itself. Sony developed a virus and buried it under downgrading software so it can brick the PSP. So its best to scan the software for viruses before you use it.|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	The custom firmware itself is actually a homebrew program.  You still need a homebrew enabled PSP to run it (i.e. 1.50 or customer firmware).  <br>  <br>  Downgrader is very hard to write becuase it involves finding security holes in the firmware.  People are still searching for one in 3.11 and 3.10.<br>  <br>  If you really want it so badly.  Why don't you just sell your 3.10 PSP and buy a 1.50 (or 3.03 OE-c) from Ebay.  That's save your trouble and risk from doing the downgrading yourselves.
1fRj5V6Aaa	Why wait?  You can just sell your 3.10 PSP and buy back one with 1.50 or 3.03 OE-C from Ebay.

1fRj5V6Aaa	It really depends on what is the current version of firmware you have.  Some firmware requires you to get an unpatched copy of  Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories (it cost $40-$60 at ebay).  Some you can just downgrade it by finding the software to downgrade it.  <br>  <br>  But for firmware above 3.03, forget about it since there is no way to downgrade it.<br>  <br>  BTW, I would not attempt a downgrade if I were you since it is very dangerous and can make your PSP useless.|`|9c86f7633f50d31df3b01396a0efad0eaa	why would u want to downgrade it..n e way it should be on the psp memory card so hook it up to ur pc and find the update on the card delete it...ive done it before cuz it takes up alot of space...
1fRj5V6Aaa	Is your PSP homebrew enabled?  If not, you cannot use it.<br>  <br>  Also, the latest Daedulas N64 emulator still not very good.

1fRj5V6Aaa	For normal PSP with version 3.00 and above, you need a PS3 to activate the PS1 emulator.  The emulator is already built in for firmware 3.00 and above.<br>  <br>  Another way to use the emulator is to upgrade your PSP with a custom firmware by Dark Alex (3.03 OE-c).  But to do that in a nomral PSP, you will need to downgrade your PSP to version 1.50 and install the custom firmware there.  However, doing that is very risky and can make your PSP totally usless.  Also, if you have version 3.10 and above, there is no way for you to downgrade to version 1.50.<br>  <br>  BTW, curretly Final Fantasy 7 is not completly playable.  The PS1 emulator is not perfect and you will encounter graphic glitch when you try to run Final Fantasy 7.
1fRj5V6Aaa	First, you need to put a gameboy emulator in the calculator.

1fRj5V6Aaa	Depends on your motherboard, you either upgrade to 2.71 or 2.80 and downgrade from there.
G3qWOiNbaa	be careful when you downgrade.  last year, sony made the psps with a special motherboard.  for these psps, if you downgrade them, it will "brick" meaning that it will be worthless as you will not be able to do anything.  you can check this by opening the umd drive and if there is anything written in white letters on the green surface, the downgrader will ruin your psp|`|9cd7cb4efc80d9142ec108ab4fee0fa1aa	Anyways.... No there isn't and sony DID make different motherboards, but hackers have made different downgraders for different motherboards. In addition it is very risky to downgrade if they do ever get one.|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	No.  Currently there is no downgrader for 3.10 and above.
IEXSqdHZaa	oh its just a background thingy|`|9cd7cb4efc80d9142ec108ab4fee0fa1aa	Do not try and use this unless you are willing to take the risk of bricking your psp. You must have either 1.5 or 3.03 Custom to use this app. And its not just a "background thingy".|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	In order to install the theme you downloaded to your PSP, you need to replace files in the PSP system memory with the one you downloaded.<br>  <br>  To replace system files, you need homebrew programs that allow you access the PSP system memory and replace them.      <br>  <br>  Since they are homebrew programs, your PSP need to be homebrew enabled, this mean you need to downgrade your PSP to 1.50.  Downgrading PSP is very dangerous and can make your PSP completely useless.<br>  <br>  In addition, it is also very dangerous to mess around with PSP system memory as well.
a0d4a4ffd933a3a2f7653e20f5c5f577aa	Celebrate first.|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	Congratulation!<br>  <br>  Try looking at the download section of <a href="http://www.psp-hacks.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.psp-hacks.com/.</a>  There are lots of homebrews and stuff you can try.<br>  <br>  If you need help, read the forum sections of the site as well.
1fRj5V6Aaa	Create one.  It should be in the root directory.
1fRj5V6Aaa	No.  Only the unpatched version can be use for downgrading.  The unpatched version is the first version of the game that came out.  After Sony found out the security hole in that version, they fixed it with a new version.  So if you get a new one at store, it most likely that not the version you want.
1fRj5V6Aaa	Yes.  All games are region free and it work with all PSP.  However, UMD movies are not region free and only with the PSP of the same region.|`|c7BQEFBNaa	Yes because the PSP can play all PSP games, it doesn't matter where the game was made or what language the game is in. So no need for an adapter converter, it is all fine|`|1fd8c552f19d161b6c27c17b9b6941aaaa	Possibly. And I think Sony is an international company so it could work.

xMnTzLf3aa	i think at startup screen u go to way left and scroll down till u find psp update|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	Homebrew updates such as 3.03 OE-c and 3.03 OE-a are programs that allow you to install a customized version of the the firmware.  The customized version of firmware has the benefit of the regular firmware and ability to run homebrews.  It also unlock some feature of regular firmware which normally you don't have access to (i.e. PS1 emulator)<br>  <br>  In order to run the update, your PSP need to be homebrew enabled.  This means you need to downgrade your PSP to version 1.50.  Unfortunately, currently, you cannot dowgrade to 1.50 from 3.11.|`|de8aff85a208cc89f489feb49db43a51aa	psp update go there and you will find it. i think|`|66a92e890f5d3543a915d58d6f086c2daa	no sorry it doesnt..get the custom 3.03 oe-a or 3.10 oe-a then it would work ..but at this moment wait for the downgrader for ur firmware|`|MR037Weiaa	no sorry i dont think it will work <br>  <br>  homebrew only works up to 2.0 so no
1fRj5V6Aaa	Assume you are trying to play ISO or CSO games:<br>  <br>  Step 1: Check your firmware to see if it is downgradeable (3.03 and below)<br>  <br>  Step 2: Downgrade your PSP to version 1.50 and hope you don't bricked your PSP (turning it completely useless) in the process.<br>  <br>  Step 3: Decide whether you want to:<br>  <br>  A: Keep it at version 1.50: Download and install Dev Hook and/or Fastloader to run the ISO<br>  <br>  B: Upgrade to custom firmware (3.03 OE-c and etc) and hope you don't brick you PSP in the process.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Use the USB connection and put the ISO file in the ISO folder (root folder)<br>  <br>  If you have a PSP already hacked, skip to step 4. Also, if you still confused, don't bother, you will brick your PSP.|`|0cd14558b59bca02f88377d3fee26645aa	The games would have to be specific PSP games. If they are, you can go into the PSP folder in the PSP itself, while connected to the computer. Then go into the GAME folder. Drag and drop the folders your games are in into the GAME folder. Disconnect and see if they work. If not, I dunno. There are some games and applications that are read as "corrupted data" on the PSP. Either your system version is too high to run the game or it's something to do with the game itself. Say your system version is 2.60, most games need to be at version 1.0- 1.50 to operate. If you have anything higher than 1.50, you're SOL. However, you can download some demos from the PlayStation Underground site. You would also have to download system update version 3.11 to play some of them. You can download Ridge Racer 2 (says it's LocoRoco Christmas Edition in the site), LocoRoco, World Tour Soccer '06, Syphon Filter Dark Mirror, and Killzone Liberation. Follow the steps on the site to get the game onto your PSP.<br>  Good luck, and the best one I played was Syphon Filter. Ridge Racer 2 is a good game with realistic SFX, but it's kinda cheesy. Maybe the UMD full version is good.|`|9cd7cb4efc80d9142ec108ab4fee0fa1aa	First, off you can't play downloaded psp games unless your psp is homebrew enabled (either v1.5 or custom 3.03). With these firmwares it is impossible. Second, it would take up too much of your memory. Third, upgrading would be the worse thing to do. And last, you can't just copy and paste the games into your psp's GAME folder. <br>  <br>  search for a tool called "Devhook" it will give you the readme file.<br>  <a href="http://qj.net/" rel="nofollow">http://qj.net/</a><br>  <a href="http://psp3d.com/" rel="nofollow">http://psp3d.com/</a>

1fRj5V6Aaa	In order to run any emulators on PSP, your PSP has to be homebrew enabled.  This also means you need to downgrade your PSP to version 1.50.<br>  <br>  Assuming your lastest update means version 3.11 (or 3.10 for that matter), there is currenlty no way to downgrade your PSP to version 1.50.|`|9cd7cb4efc80d9142ec108ab4fee0fa1aa	You do not have to have 1.5, but you do need a lower version such as 3.03 and below, nothing for the 3.10 or 3.11. I have v2.8  with every emulator on it.
1fRj5V6Aaa	That's really depends on what do you mean by theme.  If you mean wallpaper, this is how you do it:<br>  <br>  - You will need PSP 2.00 or better to make a wallpaper -- the functionality is not included in previous PSP system versions.<br>  <br>  - To download the image from a PC, right-click (or control-click on a Mac) the image you want and choose "Save Target As." Then connect your PSP with a USB cable and move the image to the \PSP\PHOTO folder on your PSP Memory Stick.<br>  <br>  - To download the image from the PSP web browser, click on an image, then move the mouse cursor over the image and hit the Triangle button. Choose "File" (over on the far left), then select "Save Image", and save to /PSP/PHOTO/<br>  <br>  - Once your image is on the Memory Stick, go to the Photo mode on your PSP menu, select the image and open it, then hit the Triangle button and choose "Set As Wallpaper".<br>  <br>  If you mean changing the xmb icons like the following:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pic4.picturetrail.com/VOL773/4873742/13410660/233532364.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://pic4.picturetrail.com/VOL773/4873...</a><br>  <br>  Your PSP must be be homebrew enabled or using customized firmware (3.03 OE-C).
1fRj5V6Aaa	When someone find a security hole in 3.11 so they can use it to downgrade their PSP to 1.50.<br>  <br>  Most of the time the update is in response to this.   3.10 is released right after someone find ways to downgrade 3.03 to 1.50.|`|de8aff85a208cc89f489feb49db43a51aa	no one knows ask later on in the year.

b47f81eceb2c9e831aa3d01bf2c5fcf7aa	Send it in to Sony, they are the masters of overpriced gaming.  Just don't be suprised if you get charged a lot for this.  <br>  <br>  BTW, I thought at first the question was my PSP won't turn her on.  I'm like dude, that's an easy one.<br>  <br>  And maybe look for a PSP Firmwire "Downgrader"|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	You have a bricked PSP.  This means your PSP is toasted and you  will not able to play with your PSP ever again.<br>  <br>  You should return it to Sony and exchange for another one.|`|oub7HibNaa	Try taking the battery off and put it back in.<br>  <br>  Or get a new battery for it, and restore system to defaults.
1fRj5V6Aaa	You probably did not wiped out flash0 because if you do, your PSP won't even start up.  <br>  <br>  However, the problem is I have no idea what you did right before the problem occurred.  "messing with my psp" is kind of vague.  You need to tell people exactly what happended.<br>  <br>  Also, you need to tell us what firmware your PSP has, because if you replace flash0 with wrong firmware version, it will make the problem worst.<br>  <br>  PS: If possible, please delete the question that addressed to me.  Thanks!|`|Uv67Pm45aa	when you turn on ur psp, does nothing come up??<br>  just like a black screen for a while then it automatically turns off?<br>  if so then ur psp is BRICKED..<br>  so you cant do anything with it unless you get a mod chip for it and it will do the trick.<br>  also you can replace the motherboard but that will cost about $90-$120. GOOD LUCK!
1fRj5V6Aaa	Sorry, I cannot find any way to access flash0 in 1.50 without using any homebrew programs (which will hang at gameboot).<br>  <br>  You may want to post your question at PSP hacks site such as <a href="http://www.psp-hacks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.psp-hacks.com/</a> to see they have any solution.<br>  <br>  To bad you don't have 3.03 OE-c or 3.10 OE-a otherwise, it is a simple problem to fix.|`|3cad8323a244471ca85f7b0ce22dbfb4aa	..................|`|AA10287427	Use the find function and just type in the file name.
1fRj5V6Aaa	You can't.  In order to run cso game, your PSP need to be homebrew enabled.<br>  <br>  For PSP 3.10, there is no way for you to make your PSP homebrew enabled.
8IGjbH6paa	Only firmware versions 1.00 and 1.50 can play psp games from the memory card.  If you have any other version then you may as well forget about it, or look at downgrading.

1fRj5V6Aaa	You cannot download it.  You have to buy a real copy of the game in order for the downgrade to work.<br>  <br>  You can get a copy at ebay.  Current price is about $40-$60.<br>  <br>  After you load the downgrader in your memory stick, all you need to do is to put the game in, start the game and the downgrader will take care of it.

Je recommande √©galement les Panasonic, dont la gestion des basses lumi√®res et le stabilisateur sont des gros avantages si on souhaite faire des photos sans flash (le rendu est toujours meilleur qu'avec un flash).|`|c44c79f76319ce6c0524248983ac82fcaa	kodak et au moins 5 millions de pixels.|`|caa2c6970c5a401b60d5040f57e1d8beaa	CANON est une bonne marque  avec piles au lithium rechargeables|`|j8ol2ZSHaa	J'ai un Canon Ixus 850 et apr√®s plusieurs comparatifs, j'ai pas trouv√© mieux !|`|yj0O6UcYaa	√©vite toute autre marque except√© Kodac et Canon, cesont les meilleures marques.

1fRj5V6Aaa	Yes.  If you have a PS3, you can purchase PSX games and download to your PSP.
1fRj5V6Aaa	Above is the correct path.<br>  <br>  BTW, in order to downgrade from 3.03, you'll need an unpatched copy of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories ($40-$60 at Ebay).<br>  <br>  To avovid brickage, read the instructions VERY carefully before you start.  If you don't understand, don't try it.  Also, follow the instructions to the teeth.    Also, make sure your battery is fully charged (I would just plug your PSP to the AC outlet just to be safe).|`|9cd7cb4efc80d9142ec108ab4fee0fa1aa	upgrade to 3.03 and then downgrade to 1.5, then upgrade to a custom 3.03 <br>  <br>  <a href="http://qj.net" rel="nofollow">http://qj.net</a>

What it does is to provide you links to BitTorrent sites which you can do it yourselves for free.<br>  <br>  Also, the stuff you downloaded are illegal as well.<br>  <br>  Finally, in order to play the games you downloaded, your PSP need to be homebrew enabled (i.e. hacked) which they never tell you.<br>  <br>  If I were you, you should cancel your membership and get a refund.

I highly recommend that you buy from a seller who has over 99% positive feedback, and make sure you always read the fine print! <br>  Happy hunting!
1fRj5V6Aaa	No.  The ISO directory is not inside PSP directory.  It should the same level as PSP directory (i.e. in the root directory).<br>  <br>  Once you do that, you should go to game/memory stick and you should be able to see it.
1fRj5V6Aaa	PSP use 802.11b for wireless internet connection.|`|4HpnUF21aa	check your psp standard if it complies with 802.11 standards.  802.11a,b and g can work together with no problem,
1fRj5V6Aaa	In order to play ISO, you need to downgrade your PSP to 1.50 first.  You can only downgrade if your firmware is 3.03 and below.

It can browse any internet site wirelessly. However, if you have a lot of songs (anywhere over 200) I wouldn't buy it because the memory cards are expensive and they don't hold as much as other devices.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|136b942d001fa5a7972d31561edfbe70aa	some cell phones have both.|`|XPWDnL8paa	Your computer.

1fRj5V6Aaa	You can install IR Shell if your PSP is version 1.50 or 2.71 (if you have different version, you need to downgrade to 1.50 first).<br>  <br>  You can download the program at :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.irshell.com/download.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irshell.com/download.html</a><br>  <br>  The installation instructions is in the zip file.|`|N1XGxnwCaa	You can install it on a open edition firmware by dropping the files in the PSP/GAMES150 folder and the IRSHELL folder directly in its own directory

It simply makes it physically larger to fit in the slot.

1fRj5V6Aaa	No such downgrader exists.<br>  <br>  For 3.40, you don't need a PS1 emulator, you already have it in 3.40.  However in order to use it, you'll need a PS3 to purchase PS1 game and download it to your PSP.|`|N1XGxnwCaa	Thats right now emulator needed for PS1 just download though your PS3.

1fRj5V6Aaa	Nothing is 100% safe.  The only thing is minimize the risks as much as you can such as following instructions closely and make sure you your PSP is fully charged. <br>  <br>  To install OE version, you'll need to install from 1.50.  So, you need to downgrade to 1.50 first.<br>  <br>  As mentioned before, downgrader and OE installation are free but to dwongrade 3.03,  you need to buy GTA:LCS.<br>  <br>  If you want it so badly and afraid of downgrade, why don't you sell your PSP and buy one already have OE on it from EBay.

1fRj5V6Aaa	Ask the seller and make sure it said 3.40 OE.  With 3.40 OE, you are pretty much set.  You don't need any devhook.  Just drop the file to the ISO folder (in the root folder, if it is not there create it) and that's it!

Never take out your battery while updating.  Maybe you can return it to Sony to see if they can give you a replacement.
N1XGxnwCaa	How about never, ISO games are pirated games burned the same way people burn DVDs. Why would sony allow that? However you can downgade to 1.5 and then upgrade to 3.40OE. OE or open edition firmware allow you to run ISO games at overclocked speeds without devhook. Also 3.00 and above already allow PSX (playstation 1 games) Just download them through the PS3 store. They work similarly to iso games|`|1fRj5V6Aaa	Unfortunately, there is no way for you to downgrade 3.40 FW to 1.50.  So, you cannot play any ISO games.
6WFIXIWfaa	Okay...I don't have a RAZR, but I think I can help.  If you have a working USB cable for it, it should be no problem.  You can try to find a program on the computer, called Motorola Phone Tools.  You can try to Google this, but you could also try RapidShare, or Downloads.com.  It is free, or if your willing to pay money, you might look for it on eBay, or Amazon.  If you want an alternative, try going on "My Computer" on your PC.  From there, it should detect something like removeable hardware, or Motorola RAZR.  Click on this and eventually, you will reach a folder, called Data.  When you open this, you should be able to drag-and-drop files into it.<br>  <br>  **I don't know if method two will work.<br>  <br>  If you were wondering where to download ringtones, I do not know any good sites.

Click on it. Go into the file that starts with "ipod" theres about 4 files, you should know it when you see it. Then you can go into a file that says itunes or music or something like that and there should be a whole bunch of files labled "F01" or something like that. Well all those folders have your music and videos, so now you just drag and drop them on your computer somewhere. Then once its all copied, you just click them and they'll be uploaded to itunes.|`|xnULbpgqaa	If you connect your two computers you can take all of your music from one to the other via shared network files.
4XPicSxnaa	Well I would suggest after you get the songs from limewire go to their file location or put them in a folder first before you try to transfer them. It doesn't work like that for the same reason you can't take a song from you wmp and just drop it in there. So just put it in a folder and then copy and paste it onto mp3.

You will download your songs. Save them in the shared file that limewire gives you. Then, hook your mp3 in to your USB port on your computer. A little window will pop up asking you what you want to do. Choose open file, the file for your mp3 will open up. Then you will drag and drop your songs from your shared file to the mp3 file. I do it for my girls all the time. It's the easiest way to do it.|`|YjYPAlyAaa	first, find the file that limewire songs are in. 1st~go to My Computer. 2nd~click on Local Disk C. 3rd~click on My Documents. 4th~If you have more than one user account on your computer, you will have to search through them. look in the shared files under each name. Whatever songs you have downloaded should be on there. Now, you have to open up a new window by going to My Computer again. If you have an MP3 player that plugs into the USB port, it will be under Devices with Removable Storage. Click on it. Then go back to your window with all the music, click and drag the song you want into the window for your MP3 player. It should transfer itself. Hopefully this helps. Good Luck.
qZLdzNnbaa	It depends on which plan you have. The basic Vision plan charges $.03 per kilobyte. Sprint says the average picture sent is 50 kilobytes, I've found it's closer to 80 if the picture sizes are 640x480. So around $2.40 per picture.<br>  <br>  If you've got a Vision Pack (either the $15 a month or higher package), it's unlimited and free.

AA11323121	1. Polish the CD. Though counterintuitive, polishing a disc can repair a scratched CD by removing some of the outer plastic coating and thus making existing scratches shallower. A number of common household products can be used to polish the CD, but toothpaste‚Äîespecially baking soda toothpaste‚Äîand Brasso are probably the most tried-and-true. You can also use a fine grit polishing compound that's used for cars or hard finishes. Apply a small amount of toothpaste (must be paste, not gel) or Brasso to a soft, clean, lint-free cloth: an eyeglass-cleaning cloth works well. Gently rub the cloth on the scratch or scuff in a non-radial motion, start at the center and rub to the edge and go around in strokes. Rubbing in a circular motion can cause small scratches that throw off the laser tracking system in the player. Try to focus your efforts solely on the scratch or scratches you‚Äôve identified (if possible). Polish in this manner for a couple of minutes, reapplying Brasso or toothpaste to the cloth as necessary. Be careful not to apply much pressure, although you will still be able to feel the cloth gently scratching the CD as it polishes.<br>     2. Remove polishing product from disc. If you used toothpaste, rinse the disc thoroughly with warm water and let dry. Make sure to remove all of the toothpaste and let the disc dry completely before trying to play it. With Brasso, wipe off excess product and let the rest dry. Then, using a clean cloth, gently wipe disc again.<br>     3. Test the disc. If the problem persists, polish again for up to 15 minutes or until the scratch is almost completely buffed out. The surface around the scratch should begin to look shiny with many tiny scratches. If you still don‚Äôt notice any difference after polishing for a few minutes, the scratch may be extremely deep, or you may be polishing the wrong scratch.<br>     4. Wax the tracks. If polishing doesn‚Äôt work, apply a very thin coat of Vaseline, liquid car wax, neutral shoe polish or furniture wax to the CD‚Äôs playing surface. Wipe excess off using clean, soft, lint-free cloth in a radial (inside to outside) motion. If using wax, follow manufacturer‚Äôs instructions (some need to dry before you wipe them off, while others should be wiped off while still wet).<br>     5. Test disc again. If the wax or Vaseline does the trick, burn a new copy of the CD immediately. The waxing method is only a temporary solution.<br>    6. Bring the CD in to get refinished. If the disc still doesn‚Äôt play correctly, bring it in to a music store (especially one that sells used CDs) or a DVD rental store and ask if they can repair the disc for you. Many of these businesses have CD refinishing machines that do a remarkable job, and they‚Äôll probably charge you less than five dollars to repair the CD.<br>    7. You can buy a disc scratch-remover at game stores like game-stop. Don't worry, it works for all types of cds. It'll work like magic.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tips   [edit]<br>  <br>      * Severely damaged CDs may not be repairable. Very deep scratches will probably require an industrial-quality machine to repair, and cracks or scratches that reach the CD‚Äôs foil may render a CD forever useless. As a matter of fact, the Compact Disc Eraser (www.DiscEraser.com) adopts this method to securely destroy old or confidential CDs and DVDs. A great device to have if your backup or personal discs become outdated or no longer needed.<br>      * To determine if the foil layer of your CD is scratched, hold the CD up to a fairly bright light and see if any pinholes are visible. Holes in the foil layer of a CD are generally not repairable, even for a professional.<br>      * Practice repairing scratched CDs that you don‚Äôt care much about before you set out to repair your favorites.<br>      * It‚Äôs a good idea to create a backup of any data disc before damage occurs.<br>      * If a CD is scratched but continues to play correctly, make a backup, but don‚Äôt bother trying to repair it yet.|`|qNvPOWymaa	You put a tiny dollop of paste on the scratch and then use a smooth cloth to polish it in.<br>  <br>  Although possible, it is not recommended to fix scratches using toothpaste. You're better off with a retail cleaning kit.
qNvPOWymaa	1. Definitions:<br>  <br>  MTP: Media Transfer Protocol. Transfers files via a media program such as Windows Media Player. Allows automatic managing of files and creation of playlists. The media player lets you sort your files via artist, title etc.<br>  <br>  MSC: Mass Storage Class. Let's you just drag and drop media files onto your player. Files must be manually copied or deleted. No playlist support.<br>  <br>  Although MTP gives you more control over how your music is played, it can be fiddly depending on the media program used. MSC is much more accessible, it works by just copying and pasting your files. However some music files (such as those bought from certain online music stores) require MTP to be used in order to transfer files.<br>  <br>  2.The battery indicator should stop blinking.<br>  <br>  3. Stop the player by double clicking on the "Safely Remove Hardware" icon in your taskbar (it looks like a USB drive with a green arrow above it), select it from the list, and press the stop button.<br>  <br>  5. On your player? Then no. The manual says you will not be able to listen to music while charging.

A86WX8Txaa	Windows has to detect your player to be able to sync it up with WMP.  I responded to a similar problem before, here's my answer:<br>  <br>  Go to Device Manager (Hold Windows button & Pause Break on your keyboard==>Hardware Tab/Device Manager) and look for your player. There should be a yellow "?", right-click and update driver: either online or from your Software Cd.<br>  <br>  P.S. Avoid connecting to a usb hub: under-powered usb ports might also be the prob.<br>  <br>  You might need to restart your computer afterwards.|`|1fhP1oddaa	Go to the samsung web site and download the latest updates and firmware and also try to get on there forums there you will get better help there than here.<br>  <br>  You may have to call the tech support phone and have them give you a patch to download to fix this problem...keep trying at the forum...
A86WX8Txaa	The main difference is that the Zen has a hard-disk (30GB or 60GB) whereas the PSP only supports memory sticks, up to 8GB available.  The second most obvious difference is the screen size (2.5" vs 4.3").  But I won't cite all of them since you sound like you know about both choices.  <br>  <br>  In the end it all comes down to what YOU need.  If you already have a DS, I'd say go for the ZVM.  Unless you're more into games than videos/music.  ;)
r8CVFUTIaa	I don't know about copying music from your ipod to his itunes... i know that's impossible without a third party application.<br>  in the preferences menu of your itunes check whether the Itunes music folder specified is the same as the folder where you have your music, otherwise just change the folder specified to the folder containing your music files

If you like a slim flip the 8600 and the 8700 rock.  The 8700 has a better camera (2mp), a louder speakerphone, and a nice big display on the outside. The maxx is still new, but Motorola tends to have a few kinks when they release new phones, and the battery door is impossible to get off it you want to put the memory card in.
AA11746368	These people averaged two calls PER DAY to customer service.  Sounds to me like they should have found a different carrier themselves.  And a long time ago.  However, I've had sprint for five years now.  Only had a problem on two occasions, and it was fixed promptly both times.  My guess is these people were calling tech support CONSTANTLY, and for no reason.  they do have to pay these people, after all, and twice a day is a lot of time eaten up that could be used on other customers.  I'm not sure that cutting them off was the best way to go, but I could understand why they did it.  And being a private business, they have the right.|`|reazkryHaa	You'd have to call them twice a day for a month with some idiot question.<br>  <br>  If you are that stupid you should not be let out of the house unattended, let alone have a cell phone.|`|AA11535508	The story got over exaggerated. <br>  <br>  First of all, these scammers, and they are phone sytem scammers by the way;<br>  <br>   were people who were calling customer service between<br>  <br>  20-50 times PER DAY!!!!! trying to sucker customer service reps into giving dicsounts, and other things like that.<br>  <br>  Sprint booted of 1000 of the most notorious scammers out of like 20 million or more customers.<br>  <br>  Who wouldn't do that.<br>  <br>  <br>  the average person who owns a cell phone probably has to call customer service a 2-3 times a YEAR!!

There are 2 sides to every story & having worked in customer service for a newspaper I WISH my company would have done this. People would call in & place ads then complain that something wasn't just right & it cost them thousands of dollars. Of coarse if we make a mistake we want to make it right by refunding their money or running another ad for free for them, but we had a few abusive customers who would call in mistakes on EVERY ad they did until statistically it was impossible that we could have made that many mistakes. A few times we even caught these customers giving us the ad wrong on purpose so they could say we made the mistake. Some people just think they have a right to free stuff & will try any scam to get it. The customer is always right.... until the customer is being dishonest to try to steal from us.

nay7AO3Daa	Verizon phones only support certain Brew java applications. They cannot use the regular .jar / .jad files. You have to download games and apps from verizon itself<br>  <br>  If you have a Verizon phone is not really unlocked since there is no such thing as unlocking a CDMA phone.

nay7AO3Daa	<a href="http://www.sk3themes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sk3themes.com/</a><br>  <br>  They have detailed instructions and lots of stuff you can download. Very helpful when I had a SK3|`|FwfPa1KPaa	Its alotta work....<br>  Okay, first you have to connect your SK3 up to the computer via the USB cable. Then you have to go to your memory card. Create a folder on the memory card named "Themes". Then create another folder inside that one named "Custom". Now you will have to take the picture you want to use as the background (any picure you want to) and open it in Paint. Resize it to 240 x 138 pixels and save it as "Custom.png". Make sure you select the .PNG format. Now move the "Custom.png" image into the "Custom" folder that you created. NOW, you are going to have to open up Notepad and create a text file that says this:<br>  <br>  # Custom # <br>  string Name(en_US) Custom<br>  bitmap ring-background Custom.png <br>  bitmap ring-folder-background Custom.png<br>  <br>  (Just copy and past that into any text editor and save it as "Theme.txt")<br>  <br>  And FINALLY you can unplug your SK3 from the computer and then just press "Menu" and goto "Backgrounds" and select "Custom" from the list. Let me know if you come across any problems, because I know it took me a couple times to get it right.
nay7AO3Daa	Yes, just call them to activate the new phone - just use the new ESN. May cost a small fee

nay7AO3Daa	File manager is a program that you can buy in the Download catalog of the SK3.
nay7AO3Daa	Yes, but the Nokia must be unlocked and have the 1900 band frequency. US carriers use 850/1900
nay7AO3Daa	None. Prepaid plans for SK are $1 per day for data (if you use it or not) and 15 cents per minute.

I think they have a patent or something on the way they do it because I've never seen another brand that does it as well as their "Theaterwide 1" mode) ... Toshiba doesn't have an LCD-RP set at the moment, but their DLPs are out of this world ... or if you're one for flat panels, their 2007/08 LCDs are just about the best I've seen (basing that on the Cinema series, but I'd assume the non-Cinema models are a good value for the price as well) ...<br>  <br>  I've been burnt by "high-end" Sony gear enough in my life that I will never go near any of it again ...|`|WzZaXev2aa	Circuit City Sucks!|`|r0bLIkHHaa	I'd rather see you investing in a 1080P unit....they also do 480 and 720 and 1080.....<br>  <br>  But if you can only afford the 720, it'll make a great BACKUP TV SET when you finally do upgrade to the 1080 unit.
AA11388730	I love my iphone and everyone who has seen or used it loves it as well. As far as being the best, it is the collect phone I have ever had. Some limitations and features I wish it had like multimedia messaging and video camera, but still one great device. If you can afford it, BUY IT!

nay7AO3Daa	Not yet. Krzr is Verizon and GSM only for now.
nay7AO3Daa	Let the battery fully drain. Keep running it until it wont even turn on. Then charge it up while the SK3 is OFF. If it still doesnt work buy a new battery - GET OEM do not buy a generic one
nay7AO3Daa	Most modern japanese cell phones are no longer compatible with US/European carriers because they are WCDMA only. You can get some older models (like the Sharp 903SH or Softbank/Samsung 707SC on eBay)

Like eveyone else I understand that they are easy to use, stylish, and come with a great online music store. I DON'T HATE THE IPOD, I JUST GENUINELY BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE BETTER CHOICES OUT THERE. I work in electronic retail so its apparent to me that people who buy iPods only seem to know JUST iPods ONLY. AND IF ARE ONE WHO LIKES IPOD, COOL. But I don't see where the bare simplicity and elegant style of an iPod player should constitute a more EXPENSIVE MP3 player. Shouldn't it be cheaper??<br>  <br>  And if you don't care for RADIO TUNERS, RADIO RECORDERS, VOICE RECORDERS, MORE STANDARD ACCESSORIES, CHEAPER OPTIONAL ACCESSORIES, REMOVABLE BATTERY, and BETTER BATTERY LIFE, well thats all a matter of personal preference. I understand that. But to call or even consider that iPod sets the standard for all other MP3 players is really just unfair or just another "overated" consumer who buy or uses them to follow a crowd. AGAIN, I DON'T HATE IPODS, I think that a lot of the competition now seeks ideas (design, menu layout, etc.) from Apple's iPod to compete with it. I DO BELIEVE iPod will have its place in HISTORY (seriously), but I understand it now, more than ever, that there is competition out there that is only being blinded by marketing and advertising. Think about it and do your research, HOW LONG HAS APPLE BEEN MAKING IPODS? Doesn't it seem like its only just recently started getting popular (and a little bit more affordable for most)? And than ask yourself "WHY APPLE IPODS?".<br>  <br>  IPOD may just be the perfect digital music player for some of you. Its not that way with me. By the way, if some of you are curious, I use IRIVER H340. I WOULD LOVE PAYING MORE FOR IT, EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T AND I FEEL BETTER BECAUSE OF IT.<br>  <br>  CNET, you keep doing what you do best, just don't let the changing fads blind your judgement and alter your devoted fans from becoming apart of it.|`|uGIFtFbCaa	You can either try Creative.com [I have one from there, they have reasonably priced ones & i've had mine for almost a year and don't know what I did before I had it]<br>  also walmart sales the same brands for cheap. and if you look on overstock.com sometimes they have them.. or even amazon.

Songs... mp3s would be fine, although wmas are preferred. (:<br>  <br>  Now if your talking about a device. It'll really depend on what you need it for. <br>  mp3 players are for songs, some offer extra functions and abilities. However their main use is to be a music player. <br>  If you plan to be watching and playing videos, definitely go for an mp4 player. They are designed for video playback and music. <br>  However both mp3 and mp4 players functions varies. Most companies provide FM Radio, Radio/Voice Recording and photo viewing. Both play MUSIC, for sure, No doubt. ; ) Some MP3 players have video though. =) <br>  I would say mp4 and mp3 players are about the same, mp4s are usually more complex.<br>  <br>  If your going after the mp4 player... probably get the ZUNE or iPod Video. Their considered mp3/4 players, really they are.  ;)<br>  <br>  Zune: <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/" rel="nofollow">http://www.zune.net/en-US/</a><br>  iPod: <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/ipod/ipod.html</a><br>  <br>  If you want more benefits, out of the two, your number one choice is the Zune. iPod is great and all, but their packed with function that most people don't even touch. Zune on the other hand have functions that'll be useful for future use, (radio, recording, etc). Zune doesn't have as much accessories to choose from, but from my view, it's not that big of a problem. Zune has a bigger screen. =]]|`|odOO4vEzaa	The only difference is that MP4 can play video, so unless you like watching music videos or podcasts on the go, get an MP3 player, and some MP3 players can view pictures, the only difference is that MP4 can view vieos.

XlPHCrIvaa	I know a great site called limewire.com  its free, easy to download, its filesharing.|`|mjAYCszCaa	There are several options for free, legal music downloads. A lot of people recommend Limewire, Bittorrent, Bearshare and the like, but most the content on such networks constitute a copyright violation.<br>  <br>  The first legal source is Podcasts. My favorite is Crap from the Past at crapfromthepast.com. The host Ron "Boogymoster" Gerber, describes it as a graduate level course in pop music, and he's not far off. You'll hear a lot of music that hasn't been on the air for a long time. The program is available as a podcast, with three half hour segments coming out a week.<br>  <br>  Another great source of Public Domain and Creative Commons music is archive.org. For example, It's amazing how much old school Jazz has fallen into the Public Domain. A lot of techno and pop artists use a Creative Commons license that makes non-commercial distribution legal.<br>  <br>  Jamendo.com is a record label that makes all their music available for download for free. The idea is to give away MP3s to encourage people to buy the actual CDs.<br>  <br>  You can also look into various music Podcasts. For example, there are some really good Celtic music podcasts, Celtic Music News being my favorite. celticmusicnews.com<br>  <br>  The BBC and NPR have a variety of music programs, most of which are free downloads or can be listened to as streaming media.<br>  <br>  If you use iTunes, the iTunes store has a selection of free music and videos, with new free music being released on Tuesdays. You can even sign up for a mailing list to be notified of new free content when it becomes available.<br>  <br>  Finally, there's etree.org. A LOT of artists give permission to allow the recording and distribution of their live performances. etree.org only offers "lossless" recordings, so you'll need to convert them into another format to use them on your portable media player. The good news is since these are lossless files to start with, you won't have the data degradation and conversion artifacts typical of say, converting a WMA to an MP3. It's more like ripping an CD.<br>  <br>  All told, there's a LOT out there free of charge. The Kuro5hin article I link to below has even more detail.<br>  <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/9/5/05113/70314" rel="nofollow">http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/9/5/0...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.celticmusicnews.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.celticmusicnews.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://archive.org" rel="nofollow">http://archive.org</a><br>  <a href="http://crapfromthepast.com" rel="nofollow">http://crapfromthepast.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jamendo.com/en/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.etree.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.etree.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/9/5/05113/70314" rel="nofollow">http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/9/5/0...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ghacks.net/2005/12/03/free-music-list-december-2005" rel="nofollow">http://www.ghacks.net/2005/12/03/free-mu...</a>|`|4Hm8ZbOvaa	um pretty much only limewire|`|88MwhP3Daa	basically, it is not legal to download music for free. if you're a not a criminal. buy music from i tunes.<br>  <br>  sony have sued 18000 people on limewire for stealing sony label music last year. if you don't want to get sued, don't do it|`|CuU8PcRZaa	ares,areslite,frostwire,bearshare|`|Vb7dpFw7aa	Ares|`|x4y4Zkw1aa	Several sites offer free legal music downloads without installing any software.

F4wn7dMraa	You could try a format of the iPod in Windows. This can work when the iPod is recognized by the computer, but not by the updater or iTunes.<br>  <br>  First, put the iPod into forced disk mode.<br>  <br>  Toggle the Hold switch on and off. (Set it to Hold, then turn it off again.) <br>  Press and hold the Menu and Select buttons for at least 6 seconds until the Apple logo appears. <br>  When the Apple logo appears, release the Menu and Select buttons and immediately press and hold the Select and the Play/Pause buttons until the Disk Mode screen appears. <br>  Disconnect iPod from the power adapter and connect it to your computer; the screen on the iPod will change and say "Do not disconnect<br>  <br>  <br>  On your PC, go "my computer" and right click on the iPod, then choose "format". Ensure the settings are at "default" and that "quick format" is not checked. Now select "format". It will take a while, but when that's finished, restore the iPod using iTunes.
A86WX8Txaa	If you appreciate good sound quality in an mp3 player, then the first thing you should do is replace your stock earbuds. You'll see a huge difference.

If you currently have a T-Mobile phone and are getting the Sidekick iD, you will have all other extra fees (such as your text messaging, etc) erased from your bill, and replacing it will be a $20 fee for the Sidekick Unlimited service.  <br>  <br>  If you are using the Sidekick without any phone options, you can easily do this for $30 a month.<br>  <br>  If you are starting a new line, you can choose one of the options above.<br>  <br>  Just note, that if you are doing the first of the three, the Sidekick will cost you $299 to switch phones.<br>  <br>  And to answer your final question, NO, there is no cheaper data plan for the Sidekick.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think it is pretty cheap as it is.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps (8

nay7AO3Daa	T-mobile might put you on smartaccess if you dont have enough credit. It will limit your monthly plan to $50 or less so SKs might not work.

4faBjwS0aa	Le probl√®me est facile √† comprendre : avec un cable p√©ritel<br>  normal, on applique une tension de 12 volts √† la broche de<br>  commutation du t√©l√©viseur qui, de ce fait, se branche sur<br>  l'appareil qui lui est appliqu√©. Dans le cas de la console, qui<br>  est appliqu√©e au TV via un adaptateur, cette tension <br>  n'existe pas, et donc le TV ne se branche pas sur la console.<br>  Toutefois, il est fort possible qu'il y ait sur la commande du<br>  t√©l√©viseur, une touche marqu√©e AU ou AV qui commute le <br>  TV manuellement . Parfois, cette commutation se fait en<br>  choisissant la touche no 0 : il faut tout essayer !!<br>  En d√©sespoir de cause, si cette commutation manuelle n'est<br>  pas pr√©sente, il vous faudra bien faire un bricolage, y<br>  compris avec une pile de 9 volts, mais dans ce cas , je vous<br>  enverrai le brochage de la prise p√©ritel, de mani√®re √† <br>  √©viter d'aller mettre cette tension n'import'o√π !!!!<br>  Remarque : l'age du t√©l√©viseur n'a rien √† voir avec ce probl√®me !<br>  Bonne chance .|`|ovGymGo7aa	ya une seule p√©ritoul sur ta tv?<br>  <br>  va acheter une tv, tu seras moins embet√© avec tous ces branchements.|`|6b8Jkbufaa	Ta tele ne detecte pas le console sur la prise peritel. <br>  Il faut valider la prise peritel (par ex, avec une touche AV de la tele).<br>  Autre solution, brancher 12v sur la broche 8 de la prise peritel.

nay7AO3Daa	That information is all wrong. Sidekicks can ONLY use the Sidekick data plans which are $29.99 a month for data only, $19.99 a month for add on to voice plan, or $1 per day prepaid. There is NO WAY to get a $5.99 plan for a sidekick. <br>  <br>  The $5.99 is for T-mobile web. It is unlimited data, but only allows access to some sites and features (i.e. no file larger than 900Kbs, no port 80 for popular email). <br>  <br>  If you have a T-mobile / unocked GSM phone with WAP/HTTP access you can use the T-mobile web feature.
nay7AO3Daa	No. Water damage shows up on the WDI (water damage indicator) which turns a different colour. They do not warranty against water damage. <br>  <br>  DO NOT USE IT ANYMORE. Take the battery out and take apart as much as you can. Let it sit in a very dry place on a towel etc for about 5-7 days before using it anymore. <br>  <br>  Then try to use it again. Water gets everywhere and takes a long time to dry out from the small places. Using it more might make something even worse go wrong.|`|fYBVJHYoaa	The buttons may, or may not recover.  Letting it get a chance to dry out for a while may help but sadly, there is no guarantee on if the phone will attain full functionality again.  Most likely, you'll end up having severe issues with the phone even if it does work right for a while, as corrosion begins on some components of the phone as soon as they're wet (the effects of that may take weeks or months to become evident).  If you have insurance with your carrier, look to that for a replacement, it's your best bet at this point.

The primary line on the account will have to give their SSN  to verify their identity or another person can be authorized (non primary) have a password to confirm their rights to change information.  My understanding is that people with authorizations can do anything but cancel or add a phone line.<br>  They will also needed to know the ID numbers for the cell phones located under their batteries.<br>  <br>  I know this because I tried to replace my husbands phone but was denied access initially.

09644ZZSaa	Is it Verizon InPulse? With this type of prepaid the phone comes in a package.<br>  <br>  InPulse phones usually come with $10 in airtime and the way they work is this:<br>  <br>  1) Your initial airtime and any airtime you add will go into your prepaid account.<br>  <br>  2) Your count is charged a 99c fee every 24 hours whether you use the phone or not.<br>  <br>  3) You get unlimited night minutes (not nights and weekends, just nights all week and weekend long) from 9:01pm to 5:59 am. These calls are not charged to your prepaid account.<br>  <br>  4) You get unlimited in calling which means calls to or from another verizon mobile phone (prepaid or contract) are free and are not charged to your prepaid account.<br>  <br>  5) All other calls are 10c a minute and this is charged to your prepaid account. Phone calls are rounded up to the nearest minute.<br>  <br>  6) Text messaging is 10c per message sent or received, Pic Messaging is 25c per message sent or received, Mobile web is 99c for 24 hours of unlimited usage.<br>  <br>  <br>  7) Cards do expire meaning if you have a balance left from the card it will be gone after expiration if you do not add a new card, however because of the 99c daily fee unless you add a bunch of cards to the account at once you will likely need to refill before your cards expire (I think the 50$ card is 90 days and even if you only use unlimited features the money on the card will only last 50 days).<br>  <br>  8) This is a great prepaid option if you know a lot of ppl on verizon or you will be calling mainly at night. If your calls will fall mainly during the day to non-verizon customers, however, there are flat rate (meaning one rate per minute, no unlimited features) prepaid carriers that will not have the daily fee.<br>  <br>  <br>  The other method of Verizon prepaid is called EasyPay. You buy a phone the same as you would with a contract but you get it a little cheaper (still more expensive than InPulse).<br>  <br>  1) You pick a plan 50$ or 70$ a month.<br>  <br>  2) With 50$ plan the minutes are 14c per minute, and with the 70$ plan they are 10c<br>  <br>  3) You get a fixed number of nights and weekend minutes (this gives you weekends too but its not unlimited)<br>  <br>  4) The rest of the charges are pretty much the same as InPulse.<br>  <br>  5) Instead of cards you refill this at a Verizon retailer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Unlike Verizon contract phones, you do have roaming fees with the prepaid so make sure you check the prepaid coverage map as it will differ from the contract coverage map.<br>  <br>  For more info check <a href="http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/prepay/" rel="nofollow">http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/prepa...</a>|`|SvkJkmeHaa	Each prepaid carrier is different, I know with Tracfone the service is good for 90 days, then you must add more or the phone service just goes off.  When you add more the time that you had rolls over into the minutes that you added.  The minutes are used in units.  So for every minute that you are on the phone takes 1 unit.  text messages are .3 minutes.  Economical for someone that won't be talking all the time.  I just purchased the Go Phone and like it much better.  The  plan is great we get free nights and weekends, and the phone is alot better too.|`|rvtOlXMDaa	Verizon has excellent customer service....

Explain that the computers will not work unless it is cool enough.|`|s6Pk8ROLaa	No they don't work the same Air Coolers draws it cooling capacity from water and when water absorb heat some of it evaporates and make the air humid while A/ C cooling capacity comes from it's compressor and copper tube filled with freon gas.<br>  <br>  Air coolers are not as cold as an A/C Unit. <br>  <br>  Air coolers  are only good for dry climates and does not work efficiently in High humid places unlike A/C it can work efficiently no matter how humid the place.<br>  <br>  Air coolers needs water every time it's tank become low with water unlike A/C it will work until it's compressor breakdown or copper tube has a leak and that is the only time you need to put freon.<br>  <br>  So if you need your room to be convenient and cool, A/C is a good idea.<br>  <br>  Hope this help
UtZUaT61aa	If you have a bluetooth enabled computer it is very easy. Just connect the two with the bluetooth software and send files back and forth. If your computer is not bluetooth enabled you can buy a bluetooth adapter from an electronics store.
GmtPlPQMaa	Yes.  Bluetooth is universal.  It doesn't matter who makes the phone/headset, all should work with one another.|`|TMCDLxiUaa	Yes you can use it. Blue tooth device does not depend on the brand it can be used with any brand.|`|3NikvtbJaa	only if your phone is blue tooth capable.

You used to be able to just sign up for it, but now it requires you pass a simple test and develop a sample program to join. No real use for it otherwise
nay7AO3Daa	It has not been added as a feature yet You have to either hack your phone - check Yahoo! and search for it or wait until apple enables that feature
nay7AO3Daa	You need to get  a new ROM check out XDA-Developers.com
f55444cc62ef742feaf3f0ed875d42c3aa	the most important thing is to shop around and see where it is cheaper. some cds are cheaper on itunes and some are cheaper in stores. the best thing about cd stores is that they have sales unlike itunes. i personally prefer having a hardcopy of my cds.|`|AA12097508	Definetly CD's since u can put them on any computer Virus free better sound quality and u have the option of doing whatever u want. If u buy them in iTunes u are stuck with copy protected which limits your plays and burn on its format AAC 128kps which sounds horrible unless u want to pay $1.30 per song for unprotected AAC|`|PJOjFqnuaa	i think it would be cheaper to buy the cd instead of buying it from itunes. tracks downloaded from itunes can only be burned 6 times, but if u buy the cd then u can make multiple copies and you can share it with your friends. also it is good to get the actual cd because if your hard drive crashes or something,<br>  you'll have a hard copy of that album|`|SX4EF4oLaa	Depends on the store and artist. But the convenience of iTunes is such a plus. And plus you can listen to 30 second samples of each song.
nay7AO3Daa	This will not work sorry. The Yahoo music and most other online music stations require specific software that the Pearl cannot run. <br>  <br>  The Internet connection does not matter much since the software on the phone is the problem.
nay7AO3Daa	Put the java games on a memory card then install via the phones OS / file manager. the jar/jad files will install and ask for confirm.
nay7AO3Daa	I have both AT&T and T-mobile and my family has Verizon. Verizon is the overall best reception hands down. The internet is also very fast using EVDO. AT&T reception is spotty, but they have 3G in SF and SJ using (its a bit slower than verizon and their plans get pricey). <br>  <br>  T-mobile has the cheapest internet plans ($29.99 for all you can use + WiFi on any HotSpot access), but their phones service internet only has EDGE which is a lot slower. Reception is pretty mucn on par with At&t except inside buidings.

c3cc29e235a754ea13be42bc0c1a5306aa	First source said: "At this time, there is no software in place to allow the iPhone to sync with Outlook on the PC platform."<br>  <br>  Blog on second source said: "It was definitely quickly glossed over in today's iPhone activation and sync walkthrough, but Apple pretty clearly stated that Mac users with Entourage can sync their calendars with the iPhone through iTunes, and PC users can sync their Outlook calendars the same way. That's totally heartening for any corporate calendar users wondering how they were going to get their datebooks on their new phone, but there was no mention whatsoever of contact syncing via Outlook / Entourage for Active Directory, just Apple Address Book and Yahoo Address Book (which could potentially leave PC users in the lurch). So, your thoughts?"<br>  <br>  Second Source again: "Update: According to Mossberg's early review it does in fact sync contacts too! Not the same as live, over the air AD access like on WinMo, but definitely close enough!"|`|UtZUaT61aa	I'm not sure if this will work because this is an Apple product.

nay7AO3Daa	Sounds like a system glitch. It happens or that AIM user is offline
nay7AO3Daa	The phone is locked. You need to get it unlocked by either going to your local dealer or calling up At&t if you have had them for 90 days (or a friend who has) and ask them for the unlock code. You can also get it online from lots of sites for a few bucks (usually around $9-10)
nay7AO3Daa	Nope. Once disabled only the account owner can reactivate it. Just go to your local target, but a prepaid phone and used that to text and pix message. they cost around $20 plus the prepaid cards. Text are around 10-20 cents and pix around 50 cents to 1 dollar per message
nay7AO3Daa	Yes. many commercial programs allow you to send SMS which appear to be from anyone, but they are quite technical and hard to set up.

nay7AO3Daa	You have to purchased the key from Mio directly. I think its around $50-75 US
nay7AO3Daa	Usually the bills do not detail the text messages in detail, but many carriers do detail WHO you text, but no carrier keeps track or details what you text.
nay7AO3Daa	Sort of off topic, but I would recommend staying away from Tracfone. they have horrible service and lots of billing problems. <br>  <br>  If you do go with them go with the C261. Its a good phone and has less problems than the el cheapo W370 razr knockoff

ZyNslK8iaa	If you want full length songs, I find it best to use Bluetooth to transfer, if your phone is Bluetooth enabled. If you have Bluetooth built into your computer, or a USB port Bluetooth transmitter, you can open up the Bluetooth program and select add device. Make sure your phone's Bluetooth is turned on. Add the phone, then select send file. When it asks the destination of the file, select your phone, then click send. Most newer Apple computers come with Bluetooth. Otherwise, you can purchase a USB port Bluetooth transmitter at an electronics store. If you phone came with a USB wire for transferring files, just plug it into your computer and it should come up under USB mass storage device under My Computer. (This is only if you are using a PC.) Then you should be able to copy and past songs into it. This should work, although the proccess varies from phone to phone.|`|IoVwHn3Eaa	you need to buy a usb cable from your service provider|`|zmgwrTYUaa	Do you mean ringtones? or just music? If your phone can play MP3 files, it should have come with a program and a wire to transfer the files.

They could sell your personal information to companies who would harass you nonstop. Then, you'll have to convince you're friends to take a long boring survey. I'd say its not worth it. I've never tried it, so I don't know if its for real.
AA11275750	I found a good site a couple days ago, www.phonezoo.com  you have to register, but it's free|`|ZyNslK8iaa	If you're looking for ring tones that are clips of real songs, I suggest you got to mobile17.com. You just need to make an account. You give them your email and your cell phone number and they don't spam it trust me. You also have to tell them what kind of phone you have. When you're all set up, click on Mega/Super/Real Tones, its under 'Create...'. I know it sounds weird but trust me. You can click on standard (free), or you can click on express (you have to donate money). If you do standard, there is a waiting queue. If you do express there's no wait. I personally do standard. You can download the ringtone with you phone's web browser (if you have it), you can receive it in a picture message (if you have it), they can email it to your phone as an attachment (if you have it), or they can e-mail it to your computer and transfer yourself (using bluetooth or a USB wire.) Then enter you cell phone number. Then continue. Then hit browse and decide what song you want for you ring tone (you must have it on your computer.) Then enter the track info. Then decide at what point you want the ring tone to start and how long you want it to be (it can be between 3 and 40 seconds.) Then hit continue, and they will crop it and convert it to mp3. I assure you this is no scam. I've used it a few times before.

A86WX8Txaa	Keep the iAudio X5. Cowon has already discontinued it and that player is considered one of the best mp3 players, if not THE best. <br>  <br>  The iAudio 6 has a successor: iAudio 7 and this one you'll want to keep. They both look the same, they are in a way, but the difference is that one has a micro hard-drive and the other, iAudio 7, has 4-8GB (possibly up to 16GB) flash memory. Also, the battery life has consequently been increased to an astonishing 60hrs. <br>  <br>  Personally, I'd keep the old NOT outdated X5 and sell the iAudio 6 for the iAudio 7. Once the X7 is out (it's in the works apparently), I'd sell the X5 and get the X7.

yVRjodEnaa	The size and weight are nice. The display screen clear. Easy to navigate. The camera lens scratches easy, so does the face. Sound isn't very good in the receiver, bluetooth is way better.

There are many versions of the razr, all with different features. Some like the V3 have minimal features (VGA camera, no memory card slot) and some have more like the V3M (1.3 megapixel camera, has memory card slot) and some are in between like the V3C (1.3 megapixel camera, no memory card slot). These are not the only differences. I'd strongly suggest buying based on features and not color. Some of the pros and cons people mentioned here are specific to one or two models of the Razr.<br>  <br>  And to the person that was accused of spilling water on their phone, there is an indicator inside the phone that changes color when exposed to liquid. It doesn't lie.

There are, however, ways you can get out of a contract.  Since you are clearly beyond the 30 day trial window, that option is gone.  so, that leaves the only other option:  When you get your bull check all of the inserts.  If any of them contain a notice about a change in the terms and condtions, that is your chance to get out.  However, the print will be very, VERY small.  Plus, it will have an expiration date on it. So, watch closely - you may have already missed a chance to get out....<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|e7Dg7bbsaa	Aside from the other answers, I've heard another way is to make as many roaming calls as you can (assuming you have no roaming fees in your current plan...which is typical nowadays). The cell provider has to then eat the cost of the roaming calls and they'll eventually drop you because it's costing them too much money.<br>  Not an easy or fast way, but it's another way!

Pastikan suara telepon tidak terdengar pecah-pecah atau volume suara tidak terlalu kecil.<br>  <br>  3) Pastikan cover mobile terbebas dari goresan yang menarik perhatian.<br>  <br>  4) Pastikan baterai dalam keadaan prima, tidak mudah habis baterai atau mati mendadak.<br>  <br>  5) Guncangkan mobile tersebut untuk beberapa kali, jika anda mendengar suara tidak nyaman dari dalam mobile, tinggalkan niat anda untuk membelinya karena kemungkinan suara tersebut berasal dari komponen yang lepas di dalamnya yang dikarenakan jatuh oleh si pemilik sebelumnya.<br>  <br>  6) Bukalah chase mobile, jika tombol-tombol atau hal lainnya yang berkarat, jangan dibeli, kemungkinan hal itu terjadi karena mobile telah tenggelam atau terkena air oleh si pemilik sebelumnya.<br>  <br>  7) Mintalah software anti-virus kepada si penjual mobile (jika di counter), karena pasti si penjual akan memberikan software tersebut gratis.<br>  <br>  Mobile adalah sebutan bagi telepon genggam sebenarnya, bukan "handphone".<br>  <br>  Semoga jawaban diatas dapat membantu.<br>  Selamat berjuang dan terima kasih.

c097660a2776366a85a5a46a4400f8b1aa	yes. its the same as if you took the hard drive off your old 360 and then plugged it back in.|`|3AC7561maa	yea all of your information is stored on your hard drive
c097660a2776366a85a5a46a4400f8b1aa	No. The phone is locked for AT&T use only. Besides what are you going to do with your sim card anyways, you need to buy a 2yr contract for at least seventy bucks a month to get a 3g iphone.
WEMZGN6Gaa	there is a difference between full screen and wide screen you have it in full screen.<br>  <br>  i have mine in wide screen and i dont have a problem|`|c097660a2776366a85a5a46a4400f8b1aa	Try changing the aspect ratio, that should fix it. If you are viewing it in full screen, it will cut off the sides because movies are in widescreen.|`|438N9tVOaa	I'm assuming it was not pirated, because no one ever does that.......lol but it could be one of two things. either your iPod is malfunctioning, which could be because you dropped it...its old...or just a manufacturing error.  If this is the case, and it happens for all of your videos it might be worth getting a new iPod with the warranty that came with it.  Second,  your computer may have made a downloading error for this specific video.  If it keeps occurring for every video I would either clear out more space in your computer so the program is more efficient, or buy some more memory if you are willing to make an investment.  This will also make everything else on your computer move more smoothly so it might be worth trying anyways.|`|ol6o74chaa	Thats called pan&scan....<br>  A widescreen movie gets 4:3eeeeed....<br>  There should be a setting on the ipod about stretching...
c097660a2776366a85a5a46a4400f8b1aa	they are comparable. the difference is minute.|`|wx3CvvcFaa	the energy saving is not much of an issue to be honest with you as both the tvs are lcd and almost the same.<br>  <br>  samsung is cheaper than the sony and the samsung also comes with 3 yr warranty .<br>  but in some countries you are getting a free ps3 with the sony<br>  <br>  the samsung model is a series 5 which is full hd ..<br>  go to the website to get model no.s and sony 32 inch is full hd as well good luck|`|TTo6XXDraa	I have 32 inch Sony Bravia 720P and it says "energy star".  And I think Sony is better!!!
438N9tVOaa	the holding capacity doesn't have to do with the length of the song so much to change from 520 to 480.  I would assume that you downloaded the songs from different hosts/ CDs that take more memory when they are imported onto your iPod.  There isn't much you can do about this... I suppose you can always get a memory upgrade at any iPod retailer.|`|c097660a2776366a85a5a46a4400f8b1aa	i doubt the space is disappearing. i think your songs are just getting bigger.|`|r8HAHhgkaa	mp3s can vary in their size depending on the length and the bit rate of the song which determines its quality. you just have longer or higher quality songs. the ipod touch you have will always have the same memory|`|vvL7uqPKaa	I had this problem with my nano. Its just the first time my songs were mostly shorter. The second time round i had more lengthy songs. Simple as that. Dont worry, youre storage is not hiding from you. Lol
AA12268676	The best is the Xbox version because it has Yoda as a special character and Yoda >>>>> Vader<br>  <br>  (Darth Vader is the ps3 special character)<br>  <br>  And also, ps3 doesn't have a rumble feature just yet so I believe the xbox will feel more.. real to you. But other than rumble/those 2 characters, the ENTIRE game is the same. But, I'd still go with xbox.|`|N27rb21Qaa	i think the kratos rumor are false since they always go with only one system exclusive character, making it yoda and darth vader. It is just up to your personal preference between the two. other than that, everything else will be exactly the same in every way shape and form.|`|iIDupcJyaa	hey dude u know even though I'm a girl and all but height doesn't matter at all man okay i mean the size, the height, or the weight what ever it still doesn't matter.talk to u later  P.S. TALK TO YOU LATER DUDE|`|NsnuKqksaa	wait..ps3 has yoda and no vador..and 360 has vador but no yoda....wow......umm....i love yoda so i would say ps3...i didnt know it did that|`|JFB7ZKIPaa	man it would be awesome if the 360 version had Ryu Hayabusa.<br>  You'll be happy with either anyway but it looks like your keen to play as Darth so just go with that I say|`|yOK8II1baa	ps3 version is rumored to have kratos from the god of war games so i would go with the ps3 version.|`|b5ps3CB0aa	i don't know|`|g0SLq7XHaa	yes, yoda does do flips and stuff but vader is slow and he has athsma lol. the 360 version is said to have better online so i'm gonna get it for 360, but i also have the PS3, so i dont know.
DrAGdXmqaa	The main difference that I have found in my drumming experience is that expensive or cheap, they are basically the same thing.  When you are getting sticks, make sure that they have to same pitch. Otherwise, you could have one stick that is too high and one that is too low.  To do that, just take them out of the case and drop them on a hard floor. You'll be able to hear the pitches. At most music stores, they will let you do that and then match a pair of sticks. <br>  <br>  DO NOT buy sticks that say, "perfect match" or something like that before you hear their pitches...because most likely they are not a good match. Or spend like $30-40 on a pair of sticks that are supposedly a perfect match.  I usually pay about $18 per pair. <br>  <br>  And I have multiple sticks for different styles of drumming. I use Ludwig 2B for heavy drumming and Ludwig 5B for my normal everyday playing. For jazz style or softer drumming I use Vic Firth 7A.  I like the quality of those...but whatever works for you is good.
bf5084d1ec35330c95ff7b7bd883bbffaa	We're too lazy here.|`|cMlXWKsFaa	We have lazy plp and here we have to test and make sure its safe and all that|`|Q0Dq4NZuaa	i think maybe wen they test to see if they're even leqal in america|`|fkqiEXCraa	who knows i wish it also happend over here in london...|`|UtiJoeD4aa	Because Bush is too busy sending troops to IRAQ to kill the poor innocent ppl|`|2gvUtPRjaa	we wast our money on stuff like space travel.  you don't see them trying to reach mars!|`|0b3def3ac48683f25c032098c65c3d14aa	Somebody else wanted to know the same exact reason, and the reason is because most students in America want to go into the arts (musicians, writers, artists etc) and less and less students are choosing math and science careers. Japan's having a big boom in technology because most of their graduates majored in math/scientific careers. It was in Time Magazine.|`|wRxQOOZeaa	Haha, just be happy with what you have. We're pretty fortunate to have some of the things that we do! <br>  <br>  :)|`|ZXaDEzVbaa	i wish i knew
F7hCe6DAaa	1.3a is basically a update for hdmi :)..improves the quality..IMO<br>  <br>  use hdmi for your picutre and get optical for your sound :)|`|AA11169105	use it to plug your PS3 into a telly with HDMI. It works well and carries sound and image. Also future proof as it is an all digital channel and will not cause copy protection issues that component can.<br>  <br>  if you can get 1.3a spec one, thats even better.|`|01K2QAydaa	yes if you got HD TV first. and atleast you got a cheap HDMI cable. thats good cuz all HDMI cables are all the same quality of signal
