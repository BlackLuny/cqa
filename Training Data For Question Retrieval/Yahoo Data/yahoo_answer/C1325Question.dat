20090202075206AAZ3jA6	Social Science;Psychology	How do you have better communication between you and your parents?	If you don't want to read all the details, just skip down to the last paragraph      Since I was 11 I have been suicidal on and off, and there really hasn't been more than a week's worth of time where I haven't been depressed or felt completely and utterly empty. I'm 14 now, turning 15 in March, and these past weeks have been really bad. I just can't stand all the bad traits of people, the repetition of everything, and I don't know, I've been feeling EXTREMELY empty. And at first I was so monotonous that I wasn't even depressed because I wasn't feeling anything- but since last night my depression has returned, and it feels stronger than ever.      In the past, I was always able to help myself out of my own depression, but these days more than ever I lack any bit of motivation or will to push myself forward. A couple of people have told me that I might have a mental disorder- and this is where lack of communication to my parents come in      I admit that the worst of my emotions are probably coming from "teen hormones," but considering that I have had about 4 years of depression now, I'm also willing to look for professional help with the bit of sanity I have left. But with my age, I can only get professional help through my parents. But they don't listen. Last year there was one point where I stayed home from school. Automatically my mom starts yelling at me about being a failure, what do you want to do with your life, you have to get straight As, etc etc etc- this isn't the cause of my depression, but the fact that she automatically started yelling about those things instead of just asking what's wrong made me mad that so many people lack the sensitivity to help others. But anyway, eventually I got to telling her that I was depressed, and had been for a long time, and I don't remember what she said word for word, but she said something like don't be silly, those doctors overcharge you so much money (we're not poor, not rich), just focus on school, etc etc. She was just blowing me off like nothing was serious, just overtaken by worry of my school studies      Since then, I have been very reluctant to talk to my parents about anything, since they don't listen to much anything. My dad has always been a tactless person- last night when I told him I didn't want to go to school tomorrow (today) he automatically just started yelling at me to finish my homework and go to school. And this morning when I was lying in bed while my bus stop time was coming, he was literally jabbing me in the sides to get me up. Finally at one point he asked me what's wrong- but it was his impatient "just go do it" what's wrong, not a genuine curiosity for what's bothering me.      Again, the lack of sensitivity from my parents isn't what's making me depressed, but it is preventing me from getting professional help which the last straw I'm reaching out for. I've talked to friends, I've tried motivating myself, I've tried keeping myself busy, and I've tried being a better Christian (not as in I feel a lack of self-esteem, but that I tried increasing the strength of my relationship with God)- none of that works, and most recently I just dropped it all. So...my question is, how do I communicate to parents who are unwilling to listen, or blinded by other things, or unwilling to talk, that I am depressed and need professional help? Or...how do I get professional help without my parents?

20081120160200AARDd6l	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	So I had  a really creepy dream where something tells me it's going to kill me tomorrow, meaning?	So granted I watch and read a lot of science fiction. So my dream is weird but here goes.      I'm with a group of 5 people, heroes, and we are trying to get out of this underground city where everything is peaceful and taken care of. Problem is there isn't supposed to be an exit, but we need to go and save someone. Some locals are helping us. We figure the exit is probably where they send the criminals, so we purposely get in trouble and sent down this shoot thing. We battle and end up in this room, there a spider monster trying our block our way. Some of the heroes are fighting it and we open the door to this other room. Me and the 2 locals and another hero go in and there's a code. A globular monster comes in. The other hero tells me to go out to the other room because this is like prophecy of my death (the globular monster). I said I'm going to stay and help crack the code (math codes, don't remember exactly) to get out. The other 2 try combinations and then I try a combination ( this is where it gets SUPER CREEPY) .       I'm at the wall with punching in the code and the globular monster comes over to me and says,    "You know I'm going to kill you tomorrow morning."    I say: "Yeah I know"   He says:" No you don't"   Then I say while punching in the last part of the code:   "You're going to kill me slowly"      Then I wake up to a ringing phone.      Meaning please. I was a little freaked out. This was during a midday nap cause I didn't have to work today. So I'm dreading tomorrow morning. I know it's probably nothing but I'm still freaked out.

20090203023944AANZHvw	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	In Australia, a man does graffiti and a woman does graffiti. The woman gets jailed and the man is let go. Why?	Most of the time, it's usually the woman that gets the slap on the wrist and the man that gets the book thrown at him.       http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/one-...       The news story above is pretty big in Australia. One woman wrote her name in a bar, and got jailed for doing graffiti vandalism and received a three-month jail sentence. Pretty harsh. A man does graffiti the next day and he's let off with a good-behavior bond. And because he's a design student, the judge wishes him luck on his future career.       It's weird to see the roles reversed. Your thoughts? Is it fair?

20090203021839AA6bIAq	Social Science;Psychology	Does this dream have any messages?	hi im 17 and male and go to college. i dont need advice about being shy but anyway i am reallly shy and never talk at college. this girl, on and off, in the past four months has been talking to me and saying hi and i havent. ive kind of recently really wanted to but never have the confidence to so ive been searching over the internet looking for bebo/ facebook sites for her and stuff, (i know it sounds stalkerish but i cant do any harm) i found a profile on some weird site about three weeks ago.    so the dream was that i was in the college library on the computers and i looked around and decided to search through google to find stuff about her if i could. i put things in like "(name).. (college)" and then i didnt realise but her friend was two seats away from me and she looked at me and stared. then i felt humiliated and skipped the lesson and it felt sooo real! the embarasment in the dream felt like reallity! so does this dream have any hidden messages by any chance?

20090203014029AA79nEt	Social Science;Economics	If inflation is so bad, why print money?	The Austrian school considers ALL inflation monetary inflation, due to increased money supply. Which is true. Localised price increases aren't inflation. If the price of bread goes up, demand for cake reduces, thus reducing price. If both increase, that's monetary inflation.      Govts banks the world over constantly say how 'commited' they are to low inflation. Well, how bout no inflation? Stop printing money! Of course, it's only the govt that ever benefits from inflation.

No one knows what happens when someone dies however after thinking of a reasonable answer, we might just have eternal sleep. That is what I think happens after we die however should we be scared of this? If this does happen, why dont we worry about this and try to figure out a solution? I know there will be many problems like overpopulation but this bothers me that my whole life I will work to become successful and have a reputation and when I die, I will just be forgotten and a few generations after I am alive, no one will care or think about me. I just want to know other peoples thoughts about this. Should I be thinking of this? Any advice helps. Thank you
20090202215349AADRRoJ	Social Science;Psychology	I have a question. If your kid was acting disrespectful towards somebody, would you buy them some new clothes?	I saw a Chinese mother do this today. Her kid acted like a fool to somebody. She totally ignored her kid's disrespectfulness towards somebody and decided to buy her kid some new clothes for their reward. I'm just wondering if anybody else would do this for their kid, if they treated a person who isn't their race with disrespect, just because they aren't the race they are and the culture they are.    I'm just wondering.  Would you reward your kid for disrespecting somebody by buying them new clothes and treating them for a day?     Yeah, that's what I saw, as if her kid was a piece of gold who could do no wrong or anything.  I almost threw up by the looks of what I was seeing.

20090203005850AAZX0SM	Social Science;Psychology	Am I being selfish about this? Please Read!!!?	We just moved house over the Christmas break, and I started my first day of my new school. I didn't want to move house and the school - I don't like it. Plain and simple.    I'm in my second to last year, so where I come from, it's a make it or break it year. Now, I don't like the teachers at my new school. They stink to be quite honest.    I like my old school better. The teachers know me and what I am capable of achieving and they know my strengths and weaknesses and how to work around and with them to benefit me.    So, I was wanting to go back to my old school, but my dad is very reluctant to let me go back - as it's about an hour's drive away. But my education is important to me and I want the best for myself. I think I would be better off at my old school.    Am I being selfish for not accepting this new school, or am I doing the right thing by going back to where I am most comfortable in this make it or break it year?
20090203015308AAhrnCd	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why is he so annoyed? Is it pride?	I work with this man, we used to be good friends but feelings developed and our friendship got awkward. Basically, I thought he was more into another woman and he did seem caught between us, so I wouldn't entertain him, despite the fact he claimed they were just friends. However, he was uncomfortable if the three of us were at a social do together, so.....Anyway, it seemed to me that when I tried to be friends with him again, he was cold. He came around then and we were getting on great, but just then, he turned cold again. So I have kept my distance, I have been polite etc, but don't go out of my way to engage him in chat etc. Thing is, THIS is pissing him off. The fact that I don't make an effort to be friends seems to be making things worse, in the sense that he now barely says hello back to me even on the odd occasions that we bump into each other during the day. I dunno, is he trying to make us more distant by doing this, or is he annoyed that I won't make an effort so is paying me back? Also, if I look well, he avoids me like the plague, makes a point of looking away or pretending that he can't see me (so I'll see him doing it, even other people have noticed this and this is a guy whose entire interaction with women is based on flirtation and compliments) BUT if I look casual, he will bouyantly say hello and it is like old times. What gives?

The men filed a complaint with the police and I was arrested, but not charged, and that has spurred me on to do it again. I got away with it once, and can again.

Ele se gabava andando de carro pelas ruas de Sain Louis com o adesivo colado no parabrisa, e todos que passavam lhe acenavam: "Uauu!", "Parabéns!",  "Dá-lhe Brasil!", "Esse é ferá!", "Boa sorte!",  e ele se sentia muito orgulhoso por ser reconhecido.
