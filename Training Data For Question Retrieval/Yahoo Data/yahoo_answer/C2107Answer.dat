suPD7c3gaa	I know I've never had this problem accessing my Yahoo! Mail.  But there has been the occasional problem in not being able to click on a link... or nothing happening when I click on it.  Refreshing the page seems to correct the problem.  If that doesn't work, close your mail page then open it again.  The next thing would be to close Safari.  Then there's emptying cache, etc.  If all else fails, restart.  For me, refreshing the page has always worked.

I believe this is a widespread issue that Yahoo needs to investigate.  I might have to switch to another provider if this doesn't resolve soon.

dd51697d2c2f5d437b4ee5f646ec148caa	My company uses Brosix.com which has the Mac version either released or under development. It's an easy messenger to use and it's actually secure as opposed to Yahoo!, MSN, Skype, and the like. <br>  <br>  You can download the free version at Brosix.org. We highly recommend it as it's helped around our office a ton. Some of our sales staff have macs, so it was important that our work instant messenger had either a mac version or one to be released soon. <br>  <br>  If you can't find the Mac version, just give it a few days because I know they're going to release that version very soon. <br>  <br>  Worst case, go with Skype for Mac, although it can be a bit buggy.
eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	"A "Top Contributor" is a member of the Yahoo Answers community who has shown that they are knowledgeable in a certain category. Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.<br>  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.<br>  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."<br>  <br>  The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.<br>  <br>  It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret. <br>  All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption, imagination, and guesswork.<br>  <br>  A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).<br>  <br>  The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.<br>  <br>  The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.<br>  <br>  If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.<br>  <br>  It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.|`|AA10520442	Yahoo does not publicize their criteria for choosing TCs other than to say that TCs have proven themselves knowledgable in a given category.  My advice is to pick a category where you feel comfortable and participate.  Participate daily if you can.  Be as helpful and polite as you can and you should become a TC in no time.|`|IxuMTGd4aa	You have to get a lot of Best Answers in one category (well, up to three) but they CAN'T be Polls and Surveys or Jokes and Riddles. Those are purely opinions, and not facts.<br>  <br>  You usually have to get fifty or more BA, but Yahoo! Answers never made a EXACT answer on what percentage, and how many. It is best to stay in one category you like, so that you can remain TC. And try not to roam, and stay in one category.<br>  <br>  They hand out badges on MONDAYS! So wait till Monday once you have over fifty Best Answers in one category, and check your profile under your Avatar there should be a bright orange badge.<br>  <br>  So, here are how/rules you can become a TC:<br>  <br>  - They give out things on MONDAYS!<br>  - Get over fifty BA<br>  - Stick to up to three categories<br>  - Stay in one category<br>  - Make sure it is one you like<br>  - Don't post in Riddles & Jokes / Polls & Surveys<br>  - Stay out of opiniated questions (you may get reported)<br>  - Check over your facts<br>  - Maybe add a link or two that is helpful, and NOT spam?<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|AA11510511	You need to pick a category, and concentrate on answering questions in that category.<br>  <br>  You need to get 10% minimum Best Answers in your chosen category, and maintain it over 10%.|`|QGU7JAIUaa	Answer a tonne of questions :P|`|AA10421992	It is speculated that you need at least 10 % best answer in a single category.<br>  You can hold a TC in up to 3 categories at one time.|`|AgqIXOasaa	You need to get loads of best answers in one catergory to become a top contributor.

Go for a walk, listen to some music, take a nap. If it happens too often, you might want to seek counseling or get bloodwork done, to be sure there is no physical or mental cause that needs to be addressed, but usually, it goes away and things are fine again.

Find soccer camps and talk to them.|`|OnAk3dBaaa	You can be patient, She will be noticed if she is that good. And she will get her playing time in. As a freshman she hasn't quite earned her time yet. As a sophmore she will get more and she will start as a junior or senior. It is just the way it is. Sort of the order of things. I wouldn't go to the coach or the atheletic director. If you complain they might wait until she is a Senior to start her. It is a team sport and like it or not you are a part of the team with your daughter. You should try to make it as harmonious as possible to make your daughters chances that much better. I would apologized to the coach and athletic director. Humbly say you were out of line and let your daughter wait for her chance. And while she is on the field she can make a difference.|`|mK53y4HRaa	Talk to the coach in a nice way, if that doesn't work, move her to another team where the coach will appreciate her talents.

Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.<br>  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.<br>  <br>  That's the official line on being a Top Contributor, and each category can have one top contributor or more. <br>  If it is a large category with a high turnover of answers they can be many Top Contributors in the category. <br>  Smaller categories with a smaller  turnover of questions may have only one TC or even no TC's.<br>  TC's are selected on their contributions to the category, questions answered and best answers gained. The bigger the category, the more questions you can answer, the more chance of getting enough best answers.  Bigger categories have more TC's, so more chance of getting the TC badge.|`|AA10421992	TC's are users that have at least 10 % best answer in certain categories.<br>  There are many, but all are not in the same category.<br>  If you hover your cursor over their avatar it will show what category (ies) they hold a TC in.

aJDYmq4Yaa	Dating back to 1614-15 Germany there were two pamphlets circulating.  Their authorship was attributed to Christian Rosenkreutz who claimed to have occult powers based on scientific alchemic knowledge (alchemists believed among other things they could turn lead into gold) he had received during travels in the East.  He founded the Order of the Rosy Cross.  However, no evidence of the Order seems to exist but there are groups claiming to continue  along Rosicrucian origins in occult fashions and traditions.|`|7149XmBqaa	Here ya go.

cIZS6Wr2aa	Your friend either has a gift or a demon himself.  He needs to become a Christian so He will be under Christ's protection.  Then He needs to pray and ask God to show Him why this is happening to him.  And you should do the same.  Become a Christian so the spirits don't rub off on you, too.   And pray for him that God will show Him whether this is from Him or whether it is something he needs to be delivered from.

It isn't in abandoned mines or any industrial sites.

u7vrul2Faa	I am just like you, I think that deep down you are not entirely happy with how your life is going at the moment and you block out these feelings and put them to the back of your mind.<br>  Even when you are not thinking about your issues deep down in your heart they are and emotional feelings rear their ugly head unexpectedly. You may even be mildly depressed and this will pass once any problems in your life are resolved.<br>  Whatever you do never turn to drink or except anxiety tablets from the doctor they just mess up your mind even more.<br>  It is normal how you are feeling, we live in a very stressful world and the fact that you are aware of your problem confirms that you are normal.<br>  Like me just take one day at a time and things will work out.|`|HYrRkTjQaa	charli its just hormones sis. remember when i was ur age? hehe i was very moody lol xx|`|kJX632msaa	It's probably hormonal.

vBwVheaXaa	Yahoo! Answers is unique in that the Asker or the Answers community can pick the best answer to a question. <br>  <br>  If two or more answers are collected, the Asker can either pick the best answer or let the community vote to choose the best answer. If the Asker takes no action within the 4-day period, the answers are automatically put to a vote by the community. <br>  If a question receives just one answer, the Asker can designate that answer as the Best Answer or extend the open period 4 more days to allow more time for answers to be posted. If the Asker takes no action, the question expires and is deleted. <br>  If a question doesn't receive any answers, the question expires and is deleted. <br>  A question becomes a Resolved Question when a Best Answer is chosen. After a question becomes Resolved it stays in Yahoo! Answers and is available for searching and browsing*. The Best Answer remains open to receive comments and ratings from the community.<br>  <br>  Because questions don't remain open for answers indefinitely, a Best Answer will represent only the “best” of those answers posted during the 4-day period as determined by the Asker or the community vote, and may not be a complete or accurate answer. It's important to remember that Resolved Questions are written by Yahoo! users, not experts hired by Yahoo!. <br>  <br>  You can't do thumbs up or down because you need to reach level two (250 points). So if you get 250+ you will be able to do it, in the mean time you can't so keep answering and getting points. Remember if you answer a question you get 2 points, if you get best answer you get 10 points, choose a best answer you get 3 points, vote for best answer 1 point.<br>  <br>  If no best answer was selected by voters on your question 5 points will be returned.<br>  <br>  If you delete an answer it's  -2 points <br>  Ask a question -5 points<br>  Vote for best answer 0 points <br>  <br>  If you recieve a "thumbs-up" rating on a best answer that you wrote (up to 50 thumbs-up are counted) you get 1 point per "thumbs-up".<br>  <br>  Hope I helped and keep answering!!|`|MPbB0ri1aa	In order to be able to use the thumbs up or thumbs down feature you need to be at least a level 2 (250 points).

If you need/want more features downloading GIMP is a great options.  Still free, but you have to download the software.

They sort through and find the legit samples so you don't have to. They are great because they are updated daily and all of their offers are "catch free", that means no long surveys, no pay offers. They also have a e-mailing list where they send you the free samples listed on their site. I use that so I get them in my email which comes daily.  It isn't required though to get the freebies.  Sometimes their descriptions are pretty funny too! If you are looking for a specific type of free sample, there is a categories list and a search bar right above categories so that you can do searches.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh yes if you are from Canada you might like:<br>  <a href="http://www.canadasamples.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.canadasamples.com</a><br>  <br>  If you are from the UK you might want:<br>  <a href="http://www.uksamples.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.uksamples.com</a><br>  <br>  WHAT I GOT:<br>  Today I just got a Kashi Bar....

I recommend you give them your real one because this is easier for verification. If you give them your spam one you might accidentally delete it. The site doesn't spam you its all the offers you will be doing that send the junk email.<br>  <br>  They also ask for your address. Don't worry too much about this all they need your address for is to mail you prizes.<br>  <br>  After you signup they will send you a confirmation link to your email address you entered.

And make sure you check your spam folders.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Complete Offers<br>  <br>  Once inside you can check out the prize list.<br>  <br>  To earn points click on "Available Offers". There you will see a whole list of offers and how many points you'll get if you complete that offer. When filling out an offer you don't have to give your real home address or phone number. And make sure you use your spam email account because believe me you will be spammed. Also, be sure to check your email occasionally for those offers that require email confirmation otherwise you won't get credited for completing the offer properly.<br>  <br>  Here are a few tips for filling out offers:<br>  1. Read the offer carefully so you know exactly what to do to get the points.<br>  2. Delete cookies before every offer<br>  3. Complete offer with realistic information<br>  4. Use a browser that accepts cookies and turn your security down<br>  5. Let each page load completely<br>  <br>  Also remember that even though most of the time you'll get the points 5-10 minutes after completing the offer, some may take up to a day or more (depending on the offer). So don't worry if you don't see the points just keep going they will appear if you've done everything correctly.<br>  <br>  Step 3: Claim Your Prize<br>  <br>  After you have enough points you can now go to "Available Prizes" and see what you can cash those points in for. This is the fun part. =)<br>  <br>  They have a ton of prizes. You'll see stuff like consoles (Xbox, PS3, Wii), video games, iPods, etc. There are Xbox Live cards in the "Xbox" section and will be emailed to you. Physical prizes like iPods and video games will deliver so make sure your address is correct before you claim a prize that requires shipping.<br>  <br>  Also, something many people don't realize is that if you don't see anything you like you can actually send a request for a custom prize. Just send support a ticket with a link to what you want from amazon.com and they'll let you know how many points you'll need.

7u77AiBjaa	Yahoo! 360 is a beta (i.e. testing) service. It's been this way since 2005. In October 2007, the Yahoo! 360 announced that they would no longer fix 360-related bugs, as they prepared to transition the service to a universal profile system. This UPS has started as of October 16, 2008, but the 360 transition to that platform (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) has not been completed.<br>  <br>  Thus, this blog deletion problem is likely not a fixable issue along with many other glitches. You can try deleting the entry through different browsers. You can delete an entry by clicking the "My Blog" page, then clicking the "Delete" link below the entry and confirming the deletion. You can also click the "Edit" link below the entry, click the "Delete" button below the entry, and then confirm the deletion. Lastly, you can try editing the blog entry and re-saving it, since it's still showing up. You can put "Deleted" in the title, erase the rest of the contents and put the word "Deleted" in the entry content area prior to re-saving.<br>  <br>  You can create a new Yahoo account and activate the 360 service for it. There's no guarantee that you will avoid the same problem (or more) though.<br>  <br>  <br>  - See blogs at <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360</a> and <a href="http://www.yprofileblog.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.yprofileblog.com</a> for more details about 360's transition to the Y!Profile. The 360 team blog is also accessible via the "Yahoo! 360 News" link in the upper right corner of your 360 space. You can post complaints on the Yahoo! 360 blog, but don't expect a personal response. <br>  - See <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=858">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> for more information on 360 glitches. <br>  - See the links in these blog entries for more details on Yahoo's overall direction and UPS: <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1414">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> , <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1168">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> , and <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1236">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> .

This has been proven by checking the IP-address, it could be tracked back to P-R. It doesn't work if you try to enter false info upon registration, because P-R uses your IP-address to confirm your identity and they sell your address and your phone number and you get phone calls from salesmen who are rather aggressive and repeatedly harrass you. It has also been reported by several people that P-R installs spyware on your harddrive.<br>  <a href="http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthread.php?p=358886" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthrea...</a><br>  <br>  Testimonial from a user on YouTube: <<...

You can block those addresses, here's how: <br>  For New Mail<br>  Go to options -> mail options -> spam -> type the unwanted email address under add a blocked address -> click add -> click "save changes". <br>  <br>  For Mail Classic<br>  Go to "mail options" in the top bar -> management -> block addresses -> under "add block" enter the email address you want to be blocked. Click "add block", click "yes" to set the block.<br>  <br>  If you got them in your messenger account, it was spim (spam over instant messages). <br>  Report the message as spam. Reporting a message as spam automatically adds that person to your Ignore List - so you won't be bothered by them again.<br>  <a href="http://messenger.yahoo.com/stealth.php">http://messenger.yahoo.com/stealth.php</a>

If a box did not appear, but it was scanned. Click start then My Documents, look for a folder named My Scans. Double click the folder. If the picture is not inside, close that folder and look for it in My Pictures.

It indicates what you think of an answer not necessarily the best. The person getting best answer gets an additional point for each thumbs up. Thumbs down does not affect points.<br>  <br>  The person receiving the best answer receives 10 points. It can be selected by the asker or put to a vote. To choose a best answer do one of the following. If the question is yours you can select a best answer after 4 hours. You will have 4 days to do it. If it is someone else's question you will have to wait 4 days if the asker does not pick it himself. There will be a "vote as best answer" button. You must vote before the vote closes after 2 more days.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?
