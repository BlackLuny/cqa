20090128141751AA5zPsY	Social Science;Psychology	Can you help me see what i am missing?	ok, my sister is 2 years younger than i am, we are both in our mid 30's. she is going through some real tough times right now. her car broke down on her, her man friend moved out. she is about to loose her job because she has no baby sitter and really can't afford one on what she makes, and no transportation to work. she can get no help through the state. her oldest son has multiple bi-polar disorders and get a disability check. he has now been sent away and she is loosing that money that she needs to pay the rent. she has 2 other small children at home. her answer to every suggestion is "i know" but she will do nothing to act on it to improve her situation. i know that she is limited in her choices right now, and i am trying to be patient with her and to help her the best way that i can. i know that she is depressed and feels hopeless right now but i am so angry with her and i am not sure why. every time she calls she needs some thing. a ride, a babysitter, some money, this, and  that......  i really want to help her but i get so tired of doing it all for her. she has about run my car to the ground, i can't babysit and work my two jobs, and buying her this and that all the time gets costly, and she now has my cell 24 hours a day running up my bill.      i guess that my question is what is the best way for me to get over my anger, why am i so angry with her to begin with and how i can help her to start helping her self so that she is not so dependent on me? what am i missing in this and why do i feel like i can't help her?

20090128092124AAx7L1O	Social Science;Psychology	Why the holy ******* hell did I dream about this?!?	Okay. So I dreamed about our yearly camp. And there's this guy from church who hates my guts because I hit on his girl best friend in the past.   Well, there was this guy who got invited to camp who was a pedo.   No one knew about his background. Just said he wanted to turn over a new leaf.   For confidentiality's sake, let's call him "Simon."   Now, Simon looked a bit like me. Although he was taller. Like way taller. He's 6'9'', I'm like...what? 5'9''?   Anyways, "Simon" stalked this 13-year-old girl. Let's name her "Tess."   Now, "Tess" went to one of the bathrooms at the campsite. And "Simon" followed her there.   And this dude who hates me got suspicious and followed him.   Instead of reporting "Simon" to the police, he said it was...me.   And since "Tess" was so scared, he convinced her that it was me.   I mean, you know how fear can mess with your brain, right?   But I was eating at the snack bar with my friends from church when it happened. So there was no way it could've been me.   But he insisted, the girl got so scared and confused she went with his story, and I got arrested.   I don't know why I dreamed about that! I mean, me?! The kid of an elder at the church?! Doing such a thing?! My God! Unthinkable!
20090128092058AAuc50g	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Ladies, do you think that "baby" CAYLEE ANTHONY is being exploited by the mainstream MEDIA ?	Ok.  I think that I have had enough of this.  Every day I turn on the TV  to my favorite cable news network.  Which is CNN of course.  AND  this man was having an argument with Mike Galanos.  Or whatever the  heck his name is.  Mike is the Italian guy from CNN Headline News,  and is on during the evening hours.  You know the one who is always  screaming an hollering about how messed up society is.  He thinks  that the man who is trying to sell, Caylee dolls should be put in jail.  And he said that he is exploiting her by doing so.  And the man, who  is wrong for selling those dolls said this.  I think that CNN is exloiting  Caylee every single day.  Especially on Nancy Grace.  And I thought  to myself,  he is right.  They are all exploiting this beautiful baby girl  for money.  It goes back to the big cooperations as always, and the  powers that be.  They are the ones who should be charged for doing  so,  but they swear they are doing this dead baby justice.  Are you  kidding me ?  Mike Galanos, Nancy Grace,  Jane Mitchell,  they should all be ashamed of themselves.  They are putting this family  through hell.  Do you agree ?  Shame on you Nancy Grace !

(thats just a little bit about me)   Here is my problem,    I feel like there is something missing in my life..i dont know what it is though. There is any emptyness in me..   My parents arent around much and dont show much affection towards me, is that it?   I thought that all the girls that i know seemed so happy when they were sleeping with guys and partying all the time. I tried that, i went throught 8 guys over only 4 months. And it only made me feel worse about myself. =(   I go to church and i am in a youth group. But praying and talking to my youth leader gets me no where. I have no "girl friends" at my school to hang out with or talk to, and only a little sister who is five, and she is a really bad listener. lol. My parents wont get me counciling..they dont even take time to notice that i am suffering from all of this. I dont know what i should do..but i am miserable like this.

20090225140913AAnvzcN	Social Science;Economics	Why waste money/earning on poor that won't help themselves?	I know poverty, I know it very well. I grew up in the over-the-rhine area of Cincinnati in the 1960 & 70's. We lived in a one room "apartment" that we lived Month to Month. At 16 my father threw me out (drunk) and I lived in the back-seat of a 1970 Nova that I bought for $300. I sprayed painted it red and it was home for 3 years. I put myself through school and I never missed a day, I still remember reading my diploma under a street light. I work at a Shell station pumpinjg gas and fixing flats & oil changes for $2.10 per hour(60 hrs per week)  and took showers at Winton Woods Park in Hamilton county for .25 cents. I always felt blessed to have what I had, I never knew a Christmas morning or a birthday cake or present until I was 27 years old. I remember waking up and starting that Nova for heat in the winter, then shuting it off because I was paying .89 cents a gallon...LOL! I put myself through business school at Wright State U and started my own business. I never felt ripped off or I was robbed of life. I had air in my lungs and work whenever I wanted it and plenty of food (not the best) anytime I wanted. I never felt the government/taxpayers owed me   anything...after all I provided everything I needed, I paid taxes every year.      Today I own that same business with 12 full-time and 4 part-time. I have a beauitfil 5 bdm home 3/bath on 10 acres with even a fishing pond. I have 4 wonderful children that never knew a day that they wern't fiully loved and adored 24/7. I have the worlds most wonderful wife and have been happily (mostly...lol) for 27 years. I have a new car and always drive one as well as my wife. I have never allowed my minority status to cripple me, I have always been too busy living, loving, working to notice.      NONE, of what I have done was because of me, it was this wonderful country called America! Today I watched a lady complaing how she wanted the government and other people to pay her mortage and bills, she lived in a 300K home.      I couldn't help but to think.....she never got her 1970 Nova ...poor thing!      We know these things.....why must we re-learn them?

I realize that people are having a tough time in this world right now.   And is stressed out to the max.  Some of you have had many issues   lately,  concerning your finances, your personal life, your job, your   home, your family,  and your friends.  All I want to say to you is keep   the faith.  And please know that there will be a better day,  even if   it does not seem like it now.  Just be positive and don't let the   pressures of daily living get you down.  Things happen for a reason,   and you have to sometimes find the answers on your own.  It is how   one overcomes adversity that defines who you are.  Pace yourself,   be conservative, cut your losses,  and be patient.  Always try to go   to a friend or family member,  if you need some serious help.  Somebody out there loves you, ok.  Ladies and gents.  Have you   every got to a point in your life where you almost gave up hope........................

20090225082837AAYjCqn	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Women's studies, Kate Millett looks at Jean Genet and Nabokov as the last pseudo romantics?	Now Paraphrasing:  "It would appear that love is dead, or very likely in a bad way. Those practitioners of romantic love linger on and the two most suspect; Genet and Nabokov are of suspicious orthodoxy. Lolita is as much a matter of kidnap, rape and coercion as the terrible passion of a lost enamoured soul. For the rest, hostility between the sexes has outdistanced romance in interest, a development due less to the inherent faults of the romantic myth, than it is to the animus toward women which their gains in this century have provoked from jealous patriarchal sentiment.       Kate Millett      Those familar with Millett's work, I'd like your comments.

20090225135154AA4FS6X	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dreaming of being a god-in-training?	That may sound a little wacky, but please listen.   Awhile ago, I had a strange dream that my best friend and I were notified by a beautiful greek-goddess-kind-of-thing woman that we were to come quickly with her. She was wearing a cream dress with golden chains for straps and a ring of green leaves type thing on her head. She walked off, and me and my BFF (Noelle) watched as she suddenly jumped up and flew away. We got a feeling that we could do so, too, so we did. In my dreams, I'm always watching the scene as a third person. The scene changed, and we were in a room in a palace, with golden canopies and yellows and happy yellow type colors around us. So, this time there was an elderly lady, and she explained we were gods-in-training. I was a little scared, but happy, and she wanted to teach us how to fly better. She said, "M (I don't like my rl name), you go first." So I grabbed onto a broom, and my wings wouldn't move and I was looking down on the lady and Noelle. They were laughing, but I was crying and wanted to get down. Then I awoke. What's it mean?

I ask this because I never had this happen to me before till last night! I mean I dream and wake up and fall back asleep but start a different dream and this time it just continued where I had left of. Dreams fascinate me. They are an amazing journey that baffle me. Also, when I dream, it is in color, or brown like sepia. Can we dream in black and white?

If so, then it almost seems like the drive for alternative fuels prompted oil companies to lower their cost.  It would not have taken long to minimize our dependency on oil and soon not have a need for it, oil companies must have realized that too.

20090128151532AArSTqa	Social Science;Economics	Comparing minimum wage from 1960 to now?	"Minimum wage rises to $6.55 an hour starting Thursday," an advocate of a higher minimum wage says "to match the buying power of the minimum wage in the 1960's, it would have to rise to $9 or $10 an hour." To figure this out, you would       1. multiply the minimum wage from the 1960's by the factor that prices have increased since then, as measured by the Consumer Price Index.   or   2. multiply the 2008 minimum wage by the factor that prices have increased since then, as measured by the Consumer Price Index.   or   3. divide the 2008 minimum wage by the Consumer Price Index from the 1960's.   or   4. divided the 1960's minimum wage by the Consume Price Index from 2008.
