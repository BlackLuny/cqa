20090129040307AAIxu2n	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I need to know the name of this book?	It's about a boy who meets his future self without knowing that it's him, and is given a small time machine that looks like a hand-made calculator. He loses the calculator on the day he recieves it, but after going on a ride at a carnival, his little sister gets hit by a car, and he must find it to save her. He does find it, but he just gets into one problem after another before he finally does save her, and he meets his future self again too. In the end he saves his friends and his sister by pushing them away and letting the car hit him instead. He ends up with nothing but a broken leg for his trouble, and he's called a hero by some, and a stupid, crazy person by others. He now knows that in the future he must make that machine again to help his younger self, but in the meantime he's having fun with his friends and stuff. Does anyone know the name of the book? I think it's called "The Do-Over Machine" but that name doesn't sound quite right. Can someone help me with this?
20090129040459AA2UFM7	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can any writers explain this to me please.?	Im wondering if anyone else has this happen to them and if anyone can explain the difference between reading out loud and reading in your head???  First i shall give a quick explanation of what happened.  A few months ago a 15/16 year old boy exposed his self to my 5 yr old daughter and tryed to get her to pull her trousers down, thankfully she got away from him before it could go any further/if it was indeed going to go any further.  We informed the police and he was dealt with accordingly, with a final warning, a year on the sex offenders register, not allowed to be alone with any girl under the age of ten for 2 yrs, and to keep well away from our house .  Also we then became involved in mediation with victim support workers, who explained what they knew about him and where we would take it from now.  One thing that had troubled me alot was that when he did finally break and admitt what he had done, he also said my daughter had asked him to do it, and although she had promised me she didnt, and i believed her, i was eager for him to finally own up to it being a lie, so i could put it to bed inside my own head, so we decided to let him write us a letter with an explanation for his actions, and we asked for him to just let us know if he had lied about what he had accused her of saying.  The letter came today as did the victim support worker, and she told me had admitted she never said it, which made me feel so happy and so proud of how quickly she had told us what he had done, and how she had remembered word for word how I had explained to her in the past that any kind of behaviour like this she must tell mummy and daddy....  I was proud of her anyway of course, but those feelings just came rushing right back to me, along with the feeling of how grafteful i am that nothing further had happened to my baby girl.  I had thought i was doing the right thing by allowing him in my house, as he is fairly deprived and just wanted to play on the xbox, which he had done perfectly well on a few occasions, but this time he had changed... no doubt wheighing things up before he attacked.  Anyway I cant help noticing an odd thing seemed to happen when I read the letter.  I read the letter twice in my head and took in everything that the boy had written, I didnt feel upset at what i read to the extent i wanted to cry, I felt more sickly and angry about it, as although he did give a slight explanation to his actions I felt he had taken up a few to many lines on the page explaining my daughters,fathers actions to him, upon finding out what he had done to his baby girl.  Anyway, about half an hour later i re-read the letter, but this time i read it out allowed to myself, and suddenly I was absalutly overwhelemd with emotion of what she had been through, and how discusting the boy was and I couldnt read the rst of the letter for a while.  I know that a simple explanation would be that I was angry and then calmed down, but usually i would just mix the two together under such circumstances and be angry and upset, so I really feel that reading out allowed has had a different impact on me.  Is this common, how does it work?  Also while I am here in this section, I would appriciate it if you could let me know how my writing skills are?  I know that they arnt anything perfect, but I am sitting on a rather interesting story that one day I would like to turn into a book.  I am planning on going to college to get the exam results i didnt get when |I was at school (D in Eng)  but would be grateeful of any comments about how it is now, at this stage im at?  Thanks for reading this, and hope you can help.

Up in the Northwest, Georgia,   Minnesota...in deese heah   Swamplands...uh, how bout   The whole world...is a mighty      Furry Someone, that ain't no   Bear. Boogey-woogey bear it   Ain't. Quiet, peaceful, roaming   Around, leaving pieces of fur      All over the place. Footprints   Galore! And, still, staid scientists   Say it don't exist. Yeah, right.   And the price of gas is 50 cents,      And Yahoo don't take coffee breaks.   In Nepal, Himalayas, it's the Yeti.   Let's not forget the Alps...hmmmm,   Hannibal's warriors saw it too.

20090129051210AAfbICe	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I have written one chapter for my story, and the prologue, feel free to say opinion.?	Summary: Beth Madison turns into a vampire on her thirteenth birthday, and is shipped off to a vampire city found only underground, but her freind has a secret of his own-he is a vampire slayer along with his fraternal twin brother.      Prologue:   “Class, relating to this book, I have a question.”   A day in Winter, a teacher had asked me a question, a very difficult question no doubt, even though I didn’t know that then, it was supposedly related to a book we were reading.    A science-fiction.   “Now class if we had a choice of immortality or the life we had now, which would you choose?” She had asked. My answer was the obvious answer any human would have picked; immortality. I had only thought of the positives of being able to live forever, not the negative side. If I had thought of the possibilities of being immortal, would I have still chosen it? I ask myself. Day after day, I ask myself this question.   I looked out at the world it is now, me being twenty, and realized the world was filled with extraordinary creatures, of the mythological kind.      Chapter 1: Sunday     Spring to fall. In between is natures green earth changing into autumn's fall colors. After, the trees look dead. But I’m in October, the month before November. The month before the trees die.       "Ow!" I blinked twice. My mother opened the curtains of my bedroom, the sunlight came through boldly, waking me up.     "What time is it?" I asked. She pointed to the clock on the wall. "One p.m.!”    She normally doesn’t let me sleep that long, she thinks it will cause death to me faster. But it figures I slept that long, I stayed up until three a.m., watching television.   "You have to wake up now."   "Fine I’ll get up!" I assured her.   "Well hurry up! Your grandparents are coming over!" She told me   "What?!" I accidentally said to loud. "Their annoying! Everything for them has to be about them! Last Time I had to wash grandma’s feet! Her feet"    "They still love you. And this time you’re not locking yourself up in your room again!!"   Crap, I thought angrily.   My mothers always in a state of denial that my dad's mother came from hell.   "Now get dressed and brush your hair they are going to get here at three!" She told me.   So, I did everything she asked, putting on a blue hoodie that extends over my waist, with baggy blue jeans.   It was 2:15 p.m. when I got done then...   Then someone opened the front door.   It was her.   I looked into the living room where the door was opened.    You know when you watch one of those comedy shows and the actor or actress comes through the Door and you can here applause? Well when grandma came through the door I thought I could hear crying in my head.   She was dressed in a red turtle neck sweater with one of those gardening hats on. Instead of pants she had a purple skirt on.    "Hey, sweetie. Did you actually help your mom out this year while I was gone or did you sit on your butt?" She asked in an aggravated tone, putting her hat on a hook by the door.   "Love you too grandmother..." I told her falsely.   "Tyla!" She called at my mother, “Did you get my Beth in an etiquette class yet? Beth pull up your pants! Are those boy jeans? I need to go shopping for skirts, Beth, for your birthday."   "How are you grandpa?" I asked, ignoring my grandmother’s whining.   "I’m doing better every day now. Thank you for asking." My grandfather said.   My grandpa is still recovering from a heart attack he had last year it was from being over worked by my grandmother. He's not like my grandmother at all, he's nice but very quiet he doesn’t talk unless you ask him a question.   My mother came into the room then.   "How are you Tyla? Has my lazy grand daughter done any work around the house this year?" My grandmother asked.    "Beth does her household chores every day, Unice, she's been very good at taking care of the house ever since Rick died, and the kids ran away" She assured her.   "Oh...Well has her etiquette improved at all?"    I think my grandmother just wants to point things out that are wrong with me.    "No, not at all." My mother told her.   Thanks for sticking up for me, mom. I thought   "Ah, well we need to work on that then while I’m over here" She showed off her pearly white teeth with her evil grin.   My mom went to the kitchen.   "Unice, what would you like for dinner?" She asked, she has to ask my grandmother, my grandmothers very picky about what she eats.   "Meatloaf would be excellent." She said formally.   My grandfather said nothing, as usual.    The rest of the evening was not so great; they started to talk about stuff they did after the last time we saw them and crap like that.   "...We then went to New York in our helicopter, it's very nice there now, they had a sale there and it was on skirts. Oh my goodness it was fantastic, wasn't it honey?" My grandma told my mother, and asked my grandpa.   He nodded; obviously he's annoyed by his wife.   "Oh, Tyla. My favorite soap is new tonight. Do you mind if we watch it? And after there’s go

20090129053006AAlWCM7	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What's the best compromise between being rational and being idealistic?	I understand that you can't be completely idealistic. That's just ridiculous. Sometimes you need to accept that the world is going to be the way it is. But I also believe that when something is idealistic doesn't mean that you shouldn't try and get there as best you can. Without a little bit of idealism nothing gets done. I've always been a little bit too idealistic and sometimes my more rational friends like to tell me why the things I say don't make sense, but I honestly believe that there's absolutely nothing wrong with seeing the world as it is and then trying to make the world better.

20090129053830AAgPnHD	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Why did people responsible for Collins submarine system relinquish responsibility to others, and then be ?	unable to take back control ?      Is it as if "Murphy" is a real person who sits in a back room planning Machiavellian plots ?   The fairly recently published book "Collins Class Submarine Story: Steel, Spies and Spin" helpfully lists key people.      If the project ran into problems, mustn't someone have relinquished control.      Reminds me of March, 1994, a half-empty Airbus A-310 belonging to Russian state airline Aeroflot crashed near the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk, killing 70 people.       Investigators said crash was caused mainly by the pilot's teenage son inadvertently disconnecting the autopilot.      The pilot relinquished control of the aircraft to let his daughter, and then his son, sit in the pilot's seat, but was he unable to get back in the pilot's seat in time.      "Start it up and see why it doesn't run" would have worked as a motto to set to work Collins.

20090129062301AAY1gb2	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Free verse thoughts told through poetry, any suggestions for improvment?	Hey Dad      This place is a prison, I've been here for years   In two-thousand and five my life changed its gears   I entered a place and I swore it was Hell   It screwed up my mind, as I'm sure you can tell   I'm lost and confused, my mind is now racing   I'm filled with anger, upon the floor I am pacing   I was plucked from the ground like roots in the dirt   My dad never cared about the people he hurt      Let's start with my mom, or maybe my brother   He didn't give a wit about one or the other   He said that he cared, it's nothing but words   The lies that he spoke I found quite absurd   After he'd lecture, I'd roll both my eyes   He goes on and on about no second tries   Well look where he's at, he's down on his knees   Guilt surrounds him and won't set him free      He says that he's changed, but it's hard to believe   All the things that you give you're called to receive   He gave distrust, I can say that is for sure   But that's not all he gave, trust me there's more   He punched my brother, it gave him a bruise   He said life is a game that we aren't called to lose   There is only succeed, so don't think you can try   You'll be chewed up and spit out if you think you can cry      I am your father and what I say goes   Like dictating soldiers, all in a row   I had to abide by his rules or plans would be broken   The thoughts in my mind aren't aloud to be spoken   It was called disrespect, and that is a fact   His rules were supposed to keep me on track   Now he's awake understands he is wrong   It was hard to admit and it took him real long      About twenty years is how long it all took   The awakening started when I wrote my first book   It opened his eyes now he sees all the facts   He was wrong in the past but he can't take it back   He constantly said I had to prove my word's true   So I give back what you gave, now the pressures on you      Do you honestly think you deserve my forgiveness?   Either way, I have to think like Jesus,    So yes, you are forgiven, but can you forgive yourself?

I’m going home    From where I come from    No need for a map    I’ve got it all down    My feet will lead me    My senses ease me    As I follow the trail    Of what had gone       I know the past    Has ways to last    In these memories    That I so need    Which I once had    The mind plays tricks    But I’ll keep on walking     Till I reach my place     Till I reach my home        If you would ask me    What I think of time      Well to be honest...     It’s just a rhyme.   A mind’s creation   Of terms and chimes     It beats like arrows    In a hanging clock    Much like words    In a poet's thoughts    The worlds' an illusion     Just press rewind     As I go on by...    I’m going home    Yes I’m going home       I know you know    The dirt of earth    All too well     But what the hell    I’ll help you out    I know you know    The freezing cold    When lips go blue    Eyes go ‘round   Enduring numbness    Cyclic smells...     But I’m coming home    I’ll get you out    We’ll start all over    No more flukes    Goodbye farewells - which ending do you prefer "goodbye farewells" or "no more farwells"          and the reason why i ask for a number is because i feel like sometimes ppl don't have the time to actually critique the poem so it would be easier for them to just give a number but i see what you mean about why its a bad idea to ask for that kind of response - so i wont ask for any numbers, just a totally honest critique and your time       thank you :)

20090129063145AA3JltN	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Would you kill for your own meat?	Vegetarians, please ignore this question. Everyone else, read on...      Let's say you were given a chance to visit an abbatoir, and you were given the chance to end the life of, say, a cow, doomed to be made into beef/hamburger/whatever. Would you?       Assume, of course, that you'd be shown how to do it right, i.e., you'd be taught how to do it quickly and with the least amount of suffering possible. Also assume that, if you don't snuff the cow, somebody else would.       I've asked this question a few times IRL and I think there's something terribly hypocritical about eating meat yet not having the stones to take life to put said meat on the table.       So, would you kill for your own meat? More importantly, if not, why not?

20090129063407AAfqkQt	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Just Wanted Some Opinions on my Poem...Thanks?	Hidden Beneath the Smile      Wake up in the morning, and go about my life.   Take a shower and brush my teeth.   Pull on my blue jeans, a shirt and a coat.   Open the door to another day that I must live alone.      I try to hide it, I’m just fine.   As I wipe away another tear.   I got it all together, don’t you worry.   I mumble as I lie to myself again.      The truth is I’m not as strong as I appear to be.   I’m not as brave as others see me.   On the outside I seem like I got everything together.   It seems like my life is perfect.      But take a glace into my eyes,   The windows to my tortured soul,   And you shall see the pain I feel.   And you will see the sham.      I’m just not fine; I don’t have it all together.   I still cry, I still miss you, I still want you back.   You were the greatest friend I ever knew.    More like a brother, I miss you kid.      And as I sat there you drifted off into a world unknown.   Up above the clouds you soar, no worries in the world.   Down here I’m left all alone, crying for you back.   But always hiding my true feelings,   Lest they sneak out through these words.

20090129054900AAOU84q	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Painting	Looking for a photo of the real intersection that inspired the painting "Paris Street; Rainy Day" by Caillebot?	I have recently re-discovered the painting "Paris Street; Rainy Day" by Gustave Caillebotte (1848-94), and discovered that this was painted based on a real intersection in Paris :      The setting: The couple in front are walking on the rue de Turin near its intersection with the rue de Moscou. The location, which still exists today, is north of the Saint-Lazare train station. Caillebotte owned property in this neighborhood. Today, a pharmacy (inset, green awning) at the intersection displays one of Caillebotte's studies for Rainy Day behind the counter.      I am looking for a photo taken of this intersection as close to the same angle as depicted in the painting (I realize that the painting is not to scale).  I have tried Google Street view but can not find a good angle.      Ideally I would like to find a photograph taken of people re-creating this painting.      So far all I can find is the really small photo from the site below and the angle does not appear correct, and the image way too small.       http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazi...

Reflecting Alone      I'm sitting on my roof with a pen and some paper   I have some stuff to do but I guess I'll do it later   These words in my mind were inscribed from the start   The pen bleeds out the feelings that are pouring from my heart      Writing has never been so hard or this difficult to do   I never found it simple but I always made it through    But this time it's different, when I write a word, I cry   I can't hold back these tears, can someone tell me why      I'm burning deep inside, I'm filled with so much pain   I'm lost and confused and wondering if I'm sane   I'm lying on my stomach, my face is on the ground   The third year's almost over, the fourth one's coming 'round      My book is almost finished, I'm afraid of how it ends   I'm concerned of it's outcome and the message that it sends   Again I start to cry as I write the next two lines   With the way that I write, I try to portray hidden signs      My life is filled with stories, some of which are sad   I express how I got through them, each one that I have had   When I was a little younger, I had my heart set on this girl    She didn't know I liked her, or that she played a big part in my world      I was scared and afraid of how she might react   If she saw my book from the front cover to the back   Lots of poems in my book, are about the way I feel   They aren't pointless words, rather meaningful and real      Her face is like an angels, but I could never let her know   Cause if she doesn't like me back, I might have to let her go   Like a waterfall, the tears come pouring down   Not because I'm sad but because I miss having her around      I guess in reality that actually means I'm sad    But how could I not be when, I think of the times we've had   Summers were the best, we would hang out all the time   But Autumn is remembered, cause it's when I wrote my first rhyme      It was my first poem and it was influenced by love   I never gave it to her, cause I wasn't brave enough   I stuttered when I spoke and when tried to say these words    I said “I love you.” and she said nothing...
20090129061812AAnVBO1	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Free verse poetry. any suggestions for improvment?	One Way Ticket To Hell  Surrounded by these thoughts, anger and depression  Refusing to get help from another therapy session  Sitting in my room, and blocking out the world  Having doubts about my love and my feelings for this girl     Sitting in the darkness, alone and so afraid  Over thinking situations such as, What if I stayed.  Considering all my options, writing them all down  Feeling like I'm lost, and like there's no hope to be found     Taking criticism to heart, and rethinking my life  Debating about suicide, by a gun or by a knife  Looking back at the times, that filled me with hate  Drinking will not help, me break free from this state    Not where I'm living, but my sick state of mind  Where a tiny bit of happiness, is very hard to find  Some say that I'm bitter, and some say I am not  Some say I'm a loser, but who I am, is all I've got    You'd never guess I'm angry, cause it's not how I appear  I put on a smile, but it's just to hide all my fear  I was a friendly person, but now I am alone  I used to be happy, it's the only part of me that showed    Now I've seen images that can not be released  The person I once was, I'm sorry to say, is now deceased  I've seen a different light, and it's dark and obscure  I've been given a disease, and I haven't found a cure    I've written about my life, some say, it's not enough  But now I'm at the point where, I just don't give a ****  This is who I am, it's who you asked me to be  Before I was innocent, but now they won't set me free    I'm trapped behind myself, in an unbreakable cage  I'm sharing a room with my hatred and rage  I'm screaming so loud, but no one can hear  I'm driving a car that won't let me steer    It's moving on forward, and it won't turn around  My basement is weak, but I need solid ground  I'm driving too fast and I can not get out   At the top of my lungs I scream, What's this about!    I'm grinding my teeth, and I'm pulling my hair  I'm entering Hell, does anyone care  Will someone please save me, nope I guess not  I can only rely on the few friends that I've got  I guess I am screwed, and it'll be a disaster  Why can't my life end, just a little bit faster  Oh wait, that is right, I've got to die slow  Cause I might write a poem about how I did go    Well forget it, I'm done, just get out of my way  I'm entering Hell, but life's in the way  Step down and back off, or I will get mad  My new goal in life is to forget what I've had    And nothing else...

In Hitler's death camps threw testing and experiments, that seem more like torture than since, the Nazis made leaps in the filed of medicine. Over the course of WW2 the first computer were built, we harness nuclear power, woman took a foot hold in the work place, Israel became a nation, we had major advances in aeronautics and rockets. ETC.       Now Im not supping or even attempt to defend Hitler or the Nazis. Nor am I making light of the deaths of thousands of lives.

20090129081651AAZT9rK	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of this plot I have, i might have errors, lol but I wanna know what you thnk?	With the anger inside, I needed somewhere to go to cool down. Somewhere peaceful. Somewhere I could take my mind off of things. My eyes scrutinized the forest around me. The trees were covered in a thick layer of snow and the pond beneath my fingers were frigid. I slipped into a sudden reverie. Flashbacks of the beautiful girl filled my mind blistering. What am I doing here, I thought as I pulled my hand from the water. Someone’s thoughts filled my mind making me even more vexed. It’s not you fault, Amaranths thoughts penetrated my mind. I turned around to see her swaying back in forth in one of the trees. What are you doing here? I thought as she jumped down and walked over toward me. Hunting, she answered. She wrapped her lithe arms around me and I took in her Lilac scent. She wasn’t aware that it had been along time since the last time I hunted. She hurried and pulled away from me when she heard what I was thinking. This can stop, she thought and leaned against the big Acacia. I leered at her as if she was my enemy and said, “ You really think that,” I took in the lifeless air around me and kept talking. “ You really believe that she will come back, that she will be here right in my arms now!” I shouted. I’m sorry, she mused and darted back to big mansion. I was right. She wasn’t going to come back, she was gone. Gone forever.

I haven't taken ballet since elementary school (2nd or 3rd grade) and that was in Germany (my dad was in the Army).  And I quit because I had soccer (which I later quit), and I was in Student Council, and the Puppet Club. In short I was extremely busy.      When I was last in ballet the teacher put me with girls that were a year and a half younger than me. I had fun, but once we moved back to the states, I want to get involved with ballet again. I don't have anything to do and I loved it.....would I get put with much younger girls, or would I be put in an older class?        By the way, how much would it cost in Utah?

Begging and pleading that I see you again.   Sometime soon so we can pick up where we left off.      The good times abruptly ended that fateful night.   I was not there to hold your hand, to save you from yourself.   You slipped into a coma, the doctors said, “just a matter of time”.      I prayed that they were wrong, that maybe you’d wake up.   I sat there in that hospital room, hour after hour, night after night.   Wishing your eyes would open, to hear you say “what up chief”.      That moment never came.    You slipped away without a word just like the doctors said.   I never got to say “I’m sorry for not being there that night”.      It has been eight months since you breathed your last.   Eight months since my eyes were dry.   Eight months since I felt ok.      It wasn’t supposed to end like this.   We were only nineteen, our whole lives ahead.   We had plans, you and me, we were gonna do so much.      I guess you never know what lies ahead.   So I just hope that you got to were your going,   Hope you’re happy; hope you’re safe.    I hope I see you again someday wherever you may be      Until we meet again I bid farewell to the greatest friend I ever knew;   To a man that saved my life, who made me who I am today.   You will be missed forever and ever.   Maybe someday we can party on into eternity.

We see what we chose. We know what we say, we bring about the false, and hide away the true.

20090129071020AAYJhAO	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	5 or 6 years ago I read a book about a woman severely burned by family members.  I just don't know the name!?	It takes place in the middle east and she is set on fire by her brother in law, under her father's direction.  It was a botched honor killing.  A stranger finds her and takes her to a hospital for help.  After that she ends up in Switzerland (I think) and then goes on to France?  She is now married and raising a family.  It's an amazing story-if only I could remember the name of the book.
20090129071220AAczzOq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Writing a novel and have hit a wall. Help me!?	I am finally writing a novel I have been planning for years and am pleased with progress so far. The first few weeks the words have come thick and fast and I am about 60,000 words in with a planned target of 180,000 to roughly fulfill the plot. The only thing is I have now hit a wall and seem to be stuck. Worse than that, when I read what I have written so far I dislike it! Is this normal to want to revise everything I have already written. Shoud I edit this part before moving on? How can i overcome this writers block?
20090129071223AAMYZF7	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Nightmare. (PG) Symbolism? Any opinions?	Here is my nightmare, pick it apart if you like. I'd really like to hear some opinions   thanks.      For some reason it was the last day of school and it also happened to be christmas day. So me and some of my closest friends went to the beach to celebrate, don't worry we weren't wagging it was a school excursion. So we're playing the in the water and building really really bad sand castles which keep on getting washed away. Then suddenly i see my little brother and mum so i walk up to them with a massive smile on my face because i'm having so much fun, so anyways. they are like.   "heyy, we're going to Cott (another beach) do you want to come with us"   then my little brother adds   "yea. their giving out free icecream"   but i say   "nah. i'm having fun here, the teacher is driving us home, i'll be fine"   anyways. I continue playing with my friends and we're mucking around doing what ever. randomly laughing having an awesome time.   and that's when it starts raining. so then we all pack into the double decker with all the christmas presents which mainly consist of massive teddy bears which have been pointlessly wrapped up and so i sit in the middle with my friend on mr left and a massively wrapped teddy bear on my right.   so then i say to my friend   "hang on. how come i didnt get a massvie teddy bear?"   so then she goes   "aah well. they were just there and on the cards they all said the same thing   To........   From santa   So we all just wrote our names on the card and took them.   and then im like   "oh" :|   slightly annoyed because I didn't get a massive teddy bear.      anyways, we were sitting right behind the teacher (mrs harvey) coz she was driving the double decker 4 wheel drive. Not a double decker bus, just a double decker 4 wheel drive.    well before i continue. lemme tell you about the beach first. To get there to hve to drive down a long road where on one side there is a 50 metre drop (150 ft i think) staright down into the ocean on the other side there is a simliar drop, but into a dense forrest with very tall trees. So there are just two lanes on this road.    anyways.   back to the story.   We all bundle into the 4WD.   me and my best friend are the last ones to ge in becuase we're sitting at the bottom behind the driver and in the passenger seat. no one. because that's where the pull down stairs are. (similar to a retractable stair from a ceiling)    So she gets the car started and by now. its pouringgg. and she turns the music on. we're all laughing an stuff and then suddenly i turn around to adjust my seatbelt and then afew cars behind us and there a purple old style mini cooper.   And its driving okay. but then it starts slowly veering left and slowly incing closer towards the cliff dropping into the thrashing waves below.    It keeps going.   The musics gone.   and everyones turned around except for mrs harvey who keeps on glancing though the rear veiw mirror.    It keep on edging towards the cliff so that both of left wheels complete leave the road,   then it finally topples into the ocean.   Everyone gasps.   But we keep on driving and its silent now.   no ones talking. because well. what exactly do you say when you just witness a car topple into the ocean.   So then we're driving and driving and there;s this long straight of road which finshed with a slightly sharp turn to the left.   I dont know how it happened.   But Mrs Harvey tried to turn.   we did turn. but not enough.   Suddenly we're crosing the lane line.   We're still going.   There's no stopping.   And then we're falling.   it's silent   and first in my head I'm like.   Oh MY GOD oh MY GOD OH MYMAFIWVNAIADIWDWT   I dont want to die like this.   there is so much i want to do.   and then i think maybe the tree will save us.   slow down the fall you know,   and the i think, I shoulg of so gone with my little brother and mum to Cott and had some free icecream.   and then i think of tomorrows news.   "17 children die in fatal car accident"   or that maybe i'd wake up two weeks later from a coma.   and then i thought    am i going to die straight away.   am i going to feel pain   ?      and then I woke up.         any thoughts?

20090129080013AAa6xuf	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Thank you kindly Mr. Officer ?	You tricked me as you fumbled   to my car with your Fife-ish looks.   I thought I was going to get a warning.   Instead you stuck to the books.      I tried to beg and plead   in my humble sort of way   to get him to understand   I'm racing to receive a delivery today.         No ma'am this time you've crossed   the wrong man (I'm trying to get to the top).   I sat there and took it like a champ   as his face turned to keystone cop.      My baby in the back seat crying   I thought - maybe if I show my boobie   This Fife will help me keep my license.   He wanted nothing to do with my anatomy.         No, this is the village, kiddo   where residents' fences don't keep   The noise and whoosh of speeding cars   out of their windows as they sleep.         Fife came back with my ticket   Tried to explain my rights   I only sat there thinking   If only I'd shown him my whites.       LOL - I can't rhyme, I don't know a thing about meter (unless I'm reading it), I have no idea if this follows a form, but I just got a speeding ticket in the village and it pisses me off.      So, what do you think?      Additional info - my whites was my "clever" way of saying panties. I can't rhyme, sorry if I've offended anyone's eyes.

I'm a mezzo-soprano, but I can also sing very high soprano, if that makes any sense. lol.   So I'm really stuck on the audition song.      Here are some of my top choices:   *I Dreamed A Dream - Les Miserables   *Part of Your World - The Little Mermaid (Broadway version...I know I know, probably really overdone, but it shows off my range nicely)   *My White Knight - The Music Man (newer version)      And...that's about it.   Here's my YouTube if you want to hear my voice.    http://youtube.com/user/broadwaylove52    I suggest watching the ones from Miss Saigon and Sweeney Todd. My range has increased a lot since then, and my voice is MUCHHH more powerful than that.      So anyway, thanks in advance! :)

20090129075506AAWgO4m	Arts & Humanities;History	Are people younger then 20 still interested in the holocaust? ?	Im in my mid 20's and have always been interested by the holocaust. It was an offal thing that happened and in my opinion made a big mark in history. It is something that made an impact in the whole world. There have been thousands of books written about it and have been translated in many languages. I know i was first taught about this in 8th grade when i read the book anne frank.     Recently i had a cousin living with me that is 15 and had also read the book but didnt really know what it was. I asked her well what did you get from the book. And she kind of just made a confused face. So my question is...Is it being taught still. If it is, at what age? How deep do they get into the subject? Besides that are many young people is still interested and captivated by this subject? Give me your opinion and if you guys are really interested in the subject in the holocaust do you mind telling me how old you are?    Oh by the way...I took a college course on resistance in germany during hitlers third reich and everybody was about 50 except me and another girl. I was shocked!

20090129080632AAQiB4m	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Book title, can anyone help?	Okay, bear with me on this. I read a book a long time ago and I can only remember certain things out of it.      It was about this girl who was the kings daughter and her mother did tapestries. These tapestries are magical.    The girl does not have a power and her brother does (which is unusual).   Her father gets poisoned and she needs to find a cure of some sort to save him. So, her and her brother go to the land Without, I think that is what it was called. There was also another little boy the same age as her brother in the Without.   I remember that in the land without they came upon a court of stone guards. I think they were in search of a sword.   I know that they are scrambled pieces but thats all I have to work with.   Only other bit of info is the mother came from a very magical tribe(kinda). She had silver hair and I beleive silver eyes.

20090129082223AA2L3ie	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my story?	I think it is going to be called Betrayal   It isn't finished yet         I stormed through the door after dad and I got home from church. I didn't even know why he made me go in the first place. He said it was healthy, I said it was stupid. I started to run up stairs so i could call my friend Kayla and talk in privacy. Before I turned around I saw dads face and it was strange. Almost like he was worried about something. "I'm sorry dad," I said, I hated when I upset my dad. (Which is quite often) "I know that. . ." I was interrupted by a loud slam. I turned around and saw two men had come in uninvited. 'That's rude' I thought to myself. I looked at my dad to see his reaction; surely he would be furious about this. He was all for politeness and whatnot. But he didn't seem surprised at all. He just ran a hand through his hair and said "Afternoon gentlemen." Then he turned to me. "Angela, go upstairs. Now."      I wanted to listen to him but something in my gut told me to stay. I turned my attention to the men. They were both huge. One was blond and the other had black hair, but other than that they looked exactly alike. "Come with us, Mr. Styer." I gasped. What would these men want with my father? I looked back at him. His face was totally composed. "Angela go upstairs." He repeated. I still couldn't bring myself to move. "No thank you." He said politely to the men. They looked at each other and grunted. The blond started to move towards me and I still couldn't seem to move my legs. "Angela! Go!" My father all but shrieked in my ear. I ran. But somehow the heavy man was faster than me. He grabbed me by the hair and drug me so I was facing my father. "You agreed she wouldn't get hurt." He said, worried thick in his voice. "The agreement was she wouldn't get hurt if you cooperated. You aren't cooperating. Would you like our daughter to die, for your faults?" The blond pressed a knife to my throat. I watched my father debate with himself until he finally said, "OK. I'm going." The blond let go of my hair, grabbed my dad's arm and drug him out the room.  I panicked.  What did those people want with my dad?  Why did he go with them?  I ran to the phone.  911.  I dialed quickly.  One ring.  Two rings.  Three rings.  Why was no one answering? Ring….  I couldn’t believe it.  No one answered.  I quickly dialed the police department, which my dad made me memorize a long time ago.   “Hello Flagstaff police.”   I was so relieved that someone answered.   “My dad was kidnapped—“    I was interrupted,   “We are closed right now our hours are—“   I hung up the phone.  This was ridiculous. No 911 and no police.  I couldn’t breathe.  There has to be someone. . .   Ah ha!  I quickly dialed the number and waited for my brother to picked up   “Hey! You’ve reached Garret Styer.  Can’t come to the phone right now—“  I hung up, and just started to cry.  I wasn’t one usually prone to tears but my dad was . . . . . kidnapped?  And I just couldn’t help it.  Just think not ten minutes ago was I complaining because I had to go to church.  That just made me cry harder.  But then I thought of something during my tears, how could 911 just not answer? Was it even possible?  I had a theory; it was a pretty weak one and I hoped to God it wasn’t true, but it was still a theory.    I grabbed the phone and called Kayla.  Ring.  Ring.  Ring.  Ring.  No one answered.  I tried my other friend Stacey. No answer.  Not everyone could be gone at the same time.  I thought to myself.  Then just one more, my ex-boyfriend Josiah.  Ring. Ring. Ring.   “Ang?”  Jos answered.   “Jos!  My dad’s been kidnapped and I can’t get a hold of Garrett!  What do I do?  Where’s Garrett?”  I all but yelled in his ear.  I started to cry again.   “Angela, just calm down.  Are okay?”  He asked.  I took me a couple of tries but I finally answered,   “N-n-no my d-d-dad has just been kidnapped.  What—“ He interrupted me.   “ No I mean physically.  Were you harmed?”  Oh, of course Jos would be worried about my health.  He was just so sweet.   “No, not at all.  Why isn’t Garret answering?  Why are so. . . . .”  I didn’t finish.     “What is happening Josiah?”  He seemed hesitant to answer me.   “I don’t know what to tell you Angela, except to go up to your room.  Take as much food as possible and hide in your closet.  Okay?  Garret or I will come and get you as soon as possible, but whatever you do, do not leave the house.  I have to go.  I love you.”  Then the line went dead.  What was that suppose to mean?  Go to my room?  Where was everyone?  Why was Jos acting like that?    I did what he said regardless of what I thought.  I took enough food to last about a month but I hoped I wouldn’t have to stay in my room that long.

20090129082740AAdZIFT	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I have another question about Mari...?	You see, my friend Mari and I both really love the Inkheart trilogy by Cornelia Funke. I got Inkdeath for my birthday in december, and I read it over break. Very good, actually. But anyways, I lent it to her the week we came back to school from break, i think the sixth.      Mari was so excited to get it, and she said she would read it as soon as possible. Fine, right? But now she WON'T read it and she won't give it back. She just keeps on getting other books to read (me: grrrrrr...) and when I ask her if she's done with it yet, she gets all agitated and says she has no time.      If she has time to read those other books and she's had Inkdeath longer, I think she is just trying to get on my last d@#& nerve. And guess what, Mari? It's working!!      What do I tell her to either give it back or read it? My friend Erica wants to read the trilogy as well and wants to borrow inkdeath from me. No prob, b/c erica reads it when she says she will!!!!! But i can't lend it to her if Marielle has it at her house, gathering dust and not being read, can I????      Please help me!!!!

I personally found the book easier to follow, but I should mention that I saw the movie first.  I think that being able to see both perspectives (present and past Harry and Hermione) it just through me off.  If they would have just stuck with the viewpoint of the present Harry and Hermione (meaning the ones who were time traveling) it would have been much easier to follow.      I would like other opinions though...

20081101073839AAwK6Wy	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Twlight the novel vs. Twilight the book?	How do you think they will compare? I always hate when someone will say about how it strays a little and I'm hoping this film sticks to the book as closely as movie-making allows.  I've been watching a bunch of videos and I have to laugh at Robert Pattinson. He is so bad at being interviewed! It is hilarious! But I do think he will make a perfect Edward. Just his tone of voice and attitude. Its funny because in an interview he commented on how Bella sees him as being flawless and perfect, but Edward finds himself to be a moron who is overly selfish and Robert sees Edward that way too. Stephenie Meyer allowing him to read Midnight Sun probably helped with that.   As for Bella....Kristen looks exactly how I'd imagine Bella, but she is just so awkward and I haven't been overly impressed with her acting skills from what I've seen. Robert can easily fool me, but she just is lacking something big (from what I've seen)....passion maybe? I don't know. What are your thoughts?
