So, I got a Pantech Duo on November 22, 2008 and the screen flew off but anyway i replaced it within my 30 days for a awesome LG Vu(as i thought)..So with the Vu it has been shocking me in the ear(not plugged up/charging) so i went to the Best Buy Store on December 5, 2008 and they were like well we think you should try the phone again so i said what ever...So i now have another Vu and the same thing has been happening... So, i went to a Best Buy on January 10, 2009 and tried to exchange for a Blackjack II and they said we can't exchange it....Do you think they should have exchanged it????

But anyways is it busted for good or can it still be salvaged???      If it is broken I am just going to wait till college to get a new one, but maybe not a 360.. Are Nintendo Wii's any good?

20090226204727AAWg8YW	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Wii sensor bar information?	This is not a question, there just seems to be many people with the wrong impression.      The Wii sensor bar DOES NOT pick up any signals whatsoever.      The sensor bar just has sets of LED lights at each of its ends (which are powered by plugging the sensor bar into the Wii).  You can see this for yourself by looking at the sensor bar through a digital camera or phone camera (as long as the Wii is on, otherwise the lights won't be on).   The remote "sees" the lights with the camera at its tip and uses them to determine where it is pointing.   The remote itself sends all pointer and motion data to the Wii via a BlueTooth connection.      You CAN use anything that emits LED lights to replace your sensor bar (such as candles) but it will most likely cause the pointer to jump around a lot.   Even pointing your remote at an open window (during the daytime) will cause a pointer to appear on your TV screen.

Nothing fancy I'm not majoring in any of the arts. I like to take photos but all I've ever used are point and shoot digital. I'd like a good camera thats fairly easy to use, but I'm not above reading the instructions. I thought about the rebel xt but heard mixed reviews on it. I also just got iPhoto 09 so I would like to have geo tagging built in for use with places or at least a camera thats compatible with a stand alone geo tagging device. It needs to be something with a good zoom, good quality, and easily adaptable to low lighting. Is there a camera out there for me? The people at the local bestbuy are incompetent so i thought i'd turn to the answers community. On a side note I'm hoping to stay under $400. Thanks for your help.

All of those games are system sellers. This has to be PS3's year. What do you think?

20090225134349AAr5Wws	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	What are some possible issues with my x box live connection?	I have a arris modem tm502g. From the modem I connect to a netgear router model RP114. Following this my connection goes into a linksys router model number EZXS88W. Finally I have an ethernet cord which connects to another ethernet cable and into my x box.      To simplify-       1. Arris Modem TM502G    2. Netgear router RP114   3. Linksys router EZXS88W   4. Ethernet cable   5. Ethernet cable   6. x box      The problem is that I can connect to x box live. Although I have connection, it is very difficult to get into any games. Usually when I attempt to play a game online, it freezes after ten seconds and then I have to sign out and sign back in and try again. (After it freezes, it takes about twenty seconds to unfreeze, after which it disconnects from x box live.)      I have called into x box services plenty of times, and each of them have a different problem/solution. Heres a few.      1. Reset the x box via the dashboard (pressing some buttons they told me to). This did not work.      2. Open a few ports in the router. This I have not tried.      3. One woman told me the Arris Modems are uncompatible for x box live, but I have not found this information elsewhere.      Please Help! I have had this problem for almost three years and I am stuck!      Thanks,   AD

For $140 to repair the lens, I think the satisfaction of a customer should be priceless.Word of mouth is the greatest form of advertisement.Perhaps Ill make a youtube vid about my experience and consumer feedback on this product.Im not sure what my next step to be.... speak to a manager at Nikon, demand something from FS??Any input will be much appreciated!
