20090304162307AAw93jF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this guy. I think he likes me. Please read! Thumbs ups all, 10 points best answer!?	Mkay. So I like this guy...He has this thing about him that I like! His laugh, his smile, his eyes, his hair, down to the flat little dark brown moles on the back of his neck. His height is perfect. He is nice, funny, sweet CUTE. I cant get him off my mind.   I think that he MIGHT like me. Tell me what ya think      Walking towards him and his friends on my way to class, I make eye contact with him then look away (He looks in my direction, no, there was nobody behind me.. I checked...). Then after me and my friend Mallika passed him, I turned around to him still watching us, his friends glanced over.   In 6th period, I sit behind him, and he always turns around and looks at me. The clock isnt behind me, and only guys sit behind me, Not even his friends.   Yesterday in the same class, we chose our own seats. He came in late, sat by the wall 2 rows behind me, and I was looking around the room, looking for my friend Parker, and I saw this guy (My crush) Looking at me.   During lunch I often seeing him looking at me...      10 POINTS BEST ANSWER!!!    Tell me what you think!!! :)
20090304162310AAob1Cv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: What do you think is "cute" about a girl?	Or what do you find attractive? Do you think it has anything to do with how they act or hold themselves? (meaning if they act shy or outgoing or if they use good or bad posture) This is the kinda stuff we girls need to know. Please help.
20090304162249AAonQBZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I make a guy like me?	I like this guy in my school and he knows I like him but he doesn't like me back. Is there any way to make him like me more...? or at least to become friends with him? Please dont say "talk to him" cuz I'm not so good at talking to guys I like.
20090304162259AAQKgPM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy that I like, but I'm mot sure if he likes me. Help?	There's a guy in my school (who is about my age). He knows I like him, But he's really shy and doesn't talk much. There are some things he does (gets closer to me if we're walking in the hall, looks at me from across a classroom, etc.), could these possibly be hints?
20090304162439AAahsdj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls you are really attracted to this guy and he says?	he says he's attracted to you or he says "I want you."      Listen I asked this before and you thought it would be better to say "I like you". The problem with that is it is a lie. I can't like someone I barely know. We barely talked, but I know we're both attracted so I wanted to take things to the next level by letting her know how i feel.      If you're not at least in high school I wouldn't expect you to understand because you never felt attracted to someone before based on anything except looks and personality.

20090304164012AARstjP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can a girl like you even though she never texts you?	This girl that i like at school usually does not text me back for some reason. Any way she liked me before and we just started hanging out last weekend. She always wants a hug and asks if we r going to hang out over the weekend and she flirts with me a lot. It seems like she likes me but she Hadley ever texts me back any more. The fact that she doesn't usually text me back tells me something is it good or bad? Or does it mean any thing? Some times she doesn't even text back at all.

20090304164004AAF1e62	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about this guy i really like?	i went to a party the other night and we all got really drunk and i ended up making out with this really good looking boy like all night.   half way through the night someone told me that he has a girlfriend but he'd been thinking about breaking up with her anyways.   we all crashed at the party and i slept next to the boy that id been with all night.   when we woke up in the morning be and the guy were still like cuddling and stuff but we didnt really say much because we're both quite shy and didnt really know what to say to eachother coz it was kind of awkward as i didnt know how he felt about it and he didnt know how i felt.   later that day he said to my friend that he felt really bad for his girlfriend.   i really like him so much, his all ive been thinking about sinse.   i just dont know what to dooooo, i want to be with him so bad.
20090304164038AAbnCab	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this?	I've met a girl a while back through a friend. Ever since the first conversation we had I liked her a lot. we've only hung out twice before, seeing as she comes from a very strict family. She goes to a catholic school, her and all her friend's parents would kill them and me and my friend if they knew the girls were hanging out with us. Also it makes it a little harder that shes quite a few towns away.       Well me and this girl recently started talking again. For some reason she faded into the distance when she thought i hated her. She's very self conscious and doesn't really believe in herself. She's so pretty, all my friends agree, but she still tells people not to say that because she's really not. She also does acting. Shes a phenomenal singer and yet she says she sucks. Whenever me and her are having a conversation, she'll say she thinks she's "bothering me" and she's "rambling" when she really isn't at all. I try to make her feel special, but she denies a lot of things. she would just say "aww thanks but i'm not that great".      I really wanna get closer to her, and I know for a fact that she likes me. Her friends have told me this, but they say that she thinks someone like me would never ever ever go for a girl like her.

20090304170248AAg6kEu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like her! What should I do?	I really like this girl. We used to talk every now and then. A week or two ago, I started talking to her a lot. For a few day, she's been ignoring my messages. We never talked that much in person, we never hanged out and she is always surrounded by her friends. I think she might know that I like her, because I made it very obvious by talking to her a lot. My question is, should I sent her a private message or an email asking her if she has been ignoring me and why? What if she asks me why it matters? I'd love to tell her that I like her, but I don't think it's the right time, so what would I say? Please keep in mind that she will most likely show this to her friends. Please help me, I've liked her for over a year.

20090304165709AAAf2Gw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I had sex with my cousins father..HELP!?	this is a repost, i want some more feedback.      i recently broke up with my boyfriend about 2 week ago. ive been lonely lately, and my cousin just moved to miami. ive been hanging around her a lot.      me and her are related on our mothers side, however she lives with her father. i haven't met him before she moved to miami, he was never a "uncle" to me or anything. my aunt wasn't with him very long, he was actually just a fling to her. so for those of you screaming INCEST! we arent related!! we've been getting to know each other though and he was always flirty with me whenever my cousins not around.      a few nights ago i stopped by after i got off work without calling because i left my cellphone at my house. i was thinking my cousin would be there because she doesn't know anyone over here to be going out. wrong! she wasn't home. she went to the gym. me and her dad got to talking. he told me how she was trying to call me and invite me to go with her and mentioned how she would be gone for a while. we talked and basically.. he made a move on me. i couldn't turn it down and we ended up having sex after some foreplay..      hes 42 or 43, and i am 19. we used protection. we had sex earlier today as well.      should i let her know? how do i tell her this?      i mean im going so crazy lately i even got turned on by a girl friend of mine touching my boob.      i just want to clear this point up - WE ARE NOT RELATED! so its not INCEST! i got a lot of people pointing fingers in my previous post, i just want to make sure everyone understands WE. ARE. NOT. RELATED!

So, this girl i like, who i am taking to prom this year, i somebody i would like to ask on a date prior to prom.  I'm completely scared of asking her out, so i think i might tell her friend, to ask her if she'd be interested in dating me...just casually, so that she doesn't find out it was me.  This way, I can know she will say yes, or I can maintain my friend status with her and still take her to the prom. What do you think?

20090304170806AAdmXCK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I talk to this girl [we talked alot before but...]?	There's this girl who i like and she's in like four of my classes. Sometimes I see my ex talking to her and i get kinda worried, cuz we had this awkward experience the other day [can't tell, but it involved a certain hand of mine, and a certain bum of hers and a gesture gone horribly wrong]. So anyway, we talk sometimes, and we have really good conversations. We e-mail each other in newspaper club [i draw the comics]  and she said to me: whatever you do, I'll always support you okay? I knew she had some sort of feelings for me, and I still have feelings for her.      So anyway, now onto the question -    I've noticed lately, when I talk to her, i always tend to run out of things to say =[ . It always turns out really awkward and I usually end up talking to her about homework/ schoolwork, or something ridiculous like that. So I was just wondering,    What kinds of things should I talk to her about?      [p.s. I'm not sure if she's single or not, but I was the only one who danced with her at the gala at school   and a few other people asked her to dance. So i'm assuming she's single]

20090304165908AALTcNY	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is my friend drifting away or is it in my head?	I'm 17 years old almost 18 and I have a friend who is 22. She's my best friend ever and we're like sisters (in my view, not sure about her). We're always hanging out and going places and just having fun, but lately we both became a little busy because I'm still in high school, I'm about to get a second job, and I'm having family issues. She's in college, has a job and is trying to get into the FBI. I understand the FBI is the future job she always wanted and everything but I really need my friend to be here for me during this whole family thing. I'm seriously not trying to be selfish or nothing but whenever I call her to hang out she's doing something or with family/friends and I'm starting to wonder if she's avoiding me. The thing is though, whenever either one of us would want to go somewhere the other would always drop what their doing and come with the other (sorry if it doesn't make sense). I know we're both growing up and we're both trying to get into law enforcement, but I want to know why she won't hang out with me even for a few minutes. Maybe you guys can answer this question for me? Serious answers only please!

20090304170540AA3VCd9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me as more than a friend?	No one seems to be answering this the first time I asked, so I'm reposting...      Ok, so I'm 16 and he's 15 (i'm pretty sure or at least he's almost 15). I met him a couple weeks ago at church and he's really sweet. We talked for a really long time at church, we were helping with setup for a dinner and we probably talked for like 2 hours combined. He's really talkative to everyone but a lot of people get really ticked off cause they think its really annoying. I dont really mind cause he's my friend and its nice to have someone to fill the silence which is usually how it is a lot when i'm talking with other people. but i don't know if it means that he likes me. at this moment, i don't think i like him as more than friends but I think he might like me.   He touched my arm a couple times when I was telling him about the problems I've been going through this year and he looks at me straight in the eye when I'm talking and it seems like he zones out slightly like he's not exactly paying attention to what I'm saying and he seems to look at me when we arent talking and opens his mouth to say something but then just looks at me for a couple more secons and looks away and eventually one of us starts talking again. and then tonight at youth group i sat by him and we talked a lot again and the girl who was sitting one person down from me said to the other girl next to me that he really likes me. so thats kinda what i thought and other people seem to think so too (one guy was teasing him about it at the end of the night when we first met) . I dont know if he's just very friendly and sweet or if he does like me as more than a friend. So....?   Please help! Thanks :D

20090304170958AAgc3hd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I had a sex dream about girls. Does that mean I'm bi or lesbian?	For a while now, I have been somewhat confused about my sexual orientation..   Last year I considered myself bi, but after one girlfriend I switched back to being straight.   I have never really had a huge crush on a guy except for one a few years ago, but I've never had a huge crush on a girl either.   Last night I had an intense sex dream with girls. What does this mean?   Love,   the confused. =/
20090304174447AApfebG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If you dont mind reading a long story, please will you give me advice?	Hey im a 15 year old girl in high school and ive liked this guy for about 11 months now & he knows i like him. We havent ever been together or anything but he was the 1st guy to ever give me that kinda attention, or hit on me. He was my 1st kiss and 1st guy to ever tell me i was pretty. A few days after we kissed, i thought i wud finally have my 1st bf i was so happy so i asked him if he wud wanna b 2gether. he said no. He said he doesnt wanna b in a relationship because he has stuff to take care of.All that was last school year and i cant tell you everything cuz itll take too long but basicly, this school year a lot has happened. (He found out i was crying over him...i felt like a lozer after that...) Anyway, a month ago i looked prettier and dressed nice and he came up to me and said "so yea we should talk more" The day after that he did talk to me, but the following weeks, he didnt try to talk to me anymore. He doesnt come up to me anymore and doesnt seem to even care. i see him talking to all these girls. Sometimes i get soo shy & nervous when i am around him. I love him soo much but what sucks is how he cant see how great i really am =[ Hes gonna graduate this year and im gonna miss him with all my heart. I kno i sound obsessed but thats just my heart.....i hope i dont sound like a lozer      But the thing im tying to say is...why is life so unfair? I pray and pray everyday to God and hope that things will b good between us. I dress up really nice , sometimes do  my makeup, and smell nice for him. But i didnt get to talk to him today..........:(   And today i found out he has a girlfriend........i wish guys would make me feel special too...wat does she have that i dont? </3 Any advice? Thanks soo much for reading all this it means a lot to me <3
20090304173010AAVsWX9	Family & Relationships;Friends	He was showing off his *** without it CENSOR?!?	I didn't actually mean to look, because I was kind of daydreaming and when I came back to reality, this guy, Grant, was showing full butt crack to everyone in class. (this was during homeroom and our teacher wasn't there at the moment) I still have that stupid image in my mind and it's soo freakin' gross. What should I do so I don't think about it? I don't like that kid, but when you see something like that, you can't help it, but think about it!

20090304180525AAbf9pX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I be happy or afraid?	I met this great guy, we get along great and have been together for about 7 months. I know he used to be in a marriage that went all wrong. I know they met and a few months later she left her hubby to be with him, and got pregnant. They had 2 kids. I guess they were together for 3 years (until her ex hubby finally signed divorce papers, then a few days later) then they got married. After 2 years of marriage, she decided to ignor her family completely and attended "church" daily and she would stay there from 5 or 6 am until about 8 or 9 pm...everyday. She admits this as well. Anyway they fought about her never being there to help with the kids, he had to miss work to try and find a babysitter, and almost lost his job. All because she HAD to go to church everyday?!?!? So they broke up, she moved all the stuff out of the house, kids and all, and moved in with a "church member". So he is fighting for his kids.       Meanwhile, I met him and after a few times of seeing each other, we got really involved with each other. Moved in together and I found out about 4 days ago I am 7 weeks pregnant. If we get into a arguement he will block me into a room until we discuss the problem, we live together. Nothing else, not hitting, no threatening nothing. But yesterday, I found out he had a restraining order from her from about June 2008- December 2008. She stated that he would hit her, choke her, and threatened to kill her and she feared for her life. But since then he has got 3 nights a week custody. He was the one that let me read it, for he handed it to me, and told me to read it. We were not fighting, so don't say it was to scare me. But should I be nervous or worried? Since he said that he never did this, she was just made because he almost lost his job and she WAS not going to work... any advice please

20090304180747AAOcz0e	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	OMG my mom is dating one of my one night stands.?	my mother just introduced me to her new boyfriend.      problem is, hes someone i've had a one night stand with! i met him at a nightclub the night of my 19th birthday.      im 19, hes 32 [yes i like older men], she just turned 37.      either hes acting like he doesnt remember me, or he really doesnt. i havent had the chance to talk to him alone yet to find out.       should i tell my mother now? or wait until i get the chance to talk to him alone? i dont know when that will be however because my mother doesnt like bringing men to the house very often. so if i wait she might fall deeper and deeper.      also, if i tell her, shes most likely going to smack the crap out of me.
20090304180504AAWnva6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he playing me or am i coming off as easy?	Naturally I'm a nice friendly girl and I started seeing this guy and talking to him for about two weeks now. In the beginning I played hard to get by not calling him or talking to him for a week. When I noticed he wasn't hanging with any other girls on campus we started talking again. BUT, as soon as he asked me to be his girlfriend he was all  over me and he mentioned sex. Please tell me if this is right  because I don't want to get my heart broken again.
20090304181115AAxB4mF	Family & Relationships;Friends	What would you do if.....?	I have tried everything to work things out with my ex-friend. But she is an emotionally closed off person and will not talk with me about our issues. Well I should say her issues, she is pissed off at me and won't even tell me why. Its been 2 months now, I've given her time and space, tried to talk to her about it but I get nothing from her. I just can't deal with her anymore. If she is unwilling to communicate with me. Then I can't waste anymore effort trying to be a good friend on her.      So I've given up trying to fix things with her.      We both go to the same bar so I will see her. I DO NOT want to work things out with her anymore or even talk to her. So how would you handle comming in contact with an ex-friend you want nothing to do with any longer.
20090304175021AASlFxb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like him. What should I do?	sorry for the length but I need your opinion on whether he likes me.      In my fourth period, there's a guy who sits across from me but to the side. and every time I look up hes looking at me, but when we make eye contact he looks away. one day in class I said a guys name who was across the room (loudly) (different guy but same name) and his head darted up to my direction.       well my best friend sits behind me and I asked him to keep an eye on him (because he didn't believe me about the staring thing) and later on he told me that when I wasn't looking but the guy was looking at me, his mouth would kind of drop open.      about a week later my friend asked the guy if he liked me but he said no. but he still stares at me.      does he like me? what should I do? (ignore or approach (& how?))
20090304175143AAWjd5E	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do? I really don't know...?	So my friend and I were talking, and somehow yahoo answers came up into the topic, and we were both talking about how addicting it is =) Anyway, she mentioned one of her question topics, and how cool some of the answers were. I looked up her question (she doesn't know) and I found it. But I read the question, and it also talked about how her grandmother in another country is dying, and her parents might be getting divorced, and all this other terrible stuff. She doesn't know that I know any of this. Should I say something to her about it? I really want to add her to my contacts, so that I can anonymously help her and stuff. BUT, i don't want her to know it's me because I ask some questions on here that are about depression and stuff, which nobody knows I have, and I don't want her to know. So should I just change my contact name and add her as a contact? Should I tell her at school that i found out, and try to help her face to face? I don't know what to do...
20090304180108AAakEea	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm 14 and need to know how to attract older men?	I dont like boys my age. For a while I have been thinking I should try to get older guys I've never had a boyfriend but I want my first boyfriend to be much older than me because it will be romantic. I find older men much more attractive than 'boys' because their just kids! My dad is having a barbeque friday and Its for the whole neighbor hood and I already have my eye on one of my dads friends lately he is about 25 but he is smoking hot! and I know hes gonna be there because he and my dad are pretty good friends. I was thinking of wearing a tight short mini skirt and a tight tanktop with a pushup bra that shows a little clevage and casual heels but I dont want to look like im trying to hard. So what can I wear? I going to be 15 next month so im basically an adult anyways :-/ So please I really need an older boyfriend because my friends had older boyfrieds that they met online and I want one in acutual real life...what are some sexy things I can wear?
20090304174429AAanWhS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Open to boys or girls- Boy trouble?	So I really like this guy at my school. He is in my grade, and he is my age. (I have had issues with guys my age, so this is one of the few guys i genuinely like that are my age) I'm going to call him C. He texts me all the time. I once texted him from 4:00 PM to 11:30 PM. I told him a lot about me. And my friends said he liked me. He always flirted with me and my friends caught him staring at me in the halls. One day I worked up the nerve to tell him I liked him. He didn't say he didn't like me, but he didn't say he did. The next day he told me he had a crush on a girl, and he hadn't told anyone he liked her yet. He said she was a cheerleader, and although I'm not a cheerleader, me and him have an inside joke where he calls me a cheerleader. I thought he was trying to trick me, and surprise me. C said he was going to ask her out the next day. I had my mind set on him asking me out. The next day, at 11:43 PM, he sent me a text saying that he asked out the prettiest girl (and meanest) on the cheerleading squad, and she said yes. I was crushed. He told me he really liked her. And I told him I was happy for him, although I actually was crying. I actually was happy for him, cause he said he had liked her for a while. I just wished C liked me. Ever since they started going out, he hasn't been answering my texts, and he has been completely ignoring me. I don't know if he wants me to stop talking to him, or if he is just obsessed with her. What should I do? Should I comfront him, or just let him be? I want to be a good friend, and want him to know that he can always come to me. I don't know how to tell him that though. Any suggestions are okay. And thank you for taking your time to help me with my problems! (Nothing nasty please. I WILL report you!)

20090304174714AArYk8M	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is failing at failing possible?	Me and my friend are arguing whether it is possible to "fail at failling."  I say that it is impossible due to the fact that once your FAILING at failing your are now FAILING which means your not FAILING at FAILING anymore.  However, he keeps insisting that it is possible.  What do you think?
20090304174814AAt7Y2y	Family & Relationships;Friends	When should I tell him how I really feel?	I've had a crush on my neighbor who is my age for about 5 years. When should I tell him how I really feel about him and how? I haven't told any of my friends at all that I like him. I know that they'll end up telling him. When we walk home from school he always tries to race me or talk to me or he does neither and just keeps looking back at me. What should I do? I haven't told anyone at all. I need help.
20090304174926AAfb3zT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex not answering texts?	I broke up with him around 4 days ago. I thought i was completely fine with it until i heard a rumor he was with someone else and i started crying. My friend found out it wasnt true from him and called me with my ex in the car. I found out that my ex told my friend to call me and tell me the truth. Well later i called him (to tell him something non-relationship related) and he sounded kind of monotone(not what he usually sounds like). Later that night i texted him asking if we could be friends eventually(to test out the waters and how he felt) and he said "Absolutly".. Now today i texted him telling him something casual i had to tell him and he wont answer. If he has no problem with being friends and seemed (thrilled) about it why woulnt he answer. Our friends say he said he is ok and said "it wasnt meant to be" but he is also very prideful...and he just recently told me he missed me a few days before i broke up with him. All of our friends also think that im 100% okay with it too, and i was until yesterday. I don't know whether he is ok with it or just not being upfront because of pride. Why wouldnt he answer his text when he seemed ok with being friends? (oh and we were together for about 7ish months)

20090304182118AApTtaW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like her! What should I do?	I really like this girl. We used to talk every now and then. A week or two ago, I started talking to her a lot. For a few day, she's been ignoring my messages. We never talked that much in person, we never hanged out and she is always surrounded by her friends. I think she might know that I like her, because I made it very obvious by talking to her a lot. My question is, should I sent her a private message or an email asking her if she has been ignoring me and why? What if she asks me why it matters? I'd love to tell her that I like her, but I don't think it's the right time, so what would I say? Please keep in mind that she will most likely show this to her friends. Please help me, I've liked her for over a year.

20090304185700AApY0R8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	They are worried about me...i'm just waiting for it all to blow up in my face....?	here's the deal. i'm a senior in my high school, the type of girl who's very shy and to herself with only a few friends and is involved alot in music and art. i met a guy from another high school. we hit it off and everythings been great. over the last three months, ive been realizing that he's like my polar opposite. he's funny, social, and popular. he's been bringing me to my first concerts and parties and to meet people, and even tho ive been having the time of my life, its also the scariest. i'm like scared of all these people and experiences it makes me extremely uncomfortable, but its fun and worth it...but it stresses me out...at my school im nothing. at this other school people greet me with hugs and everything. its kinda overwhelming. and my boyfriend doesn't know this. he doesn't know i'm not popular. i feel like i have to have everything in control and make him and all these new people believe that im not some loser. recently ive been getting comments that ive been dropping weight kinda fast. i'm too stressed out to eat. some girl called me on being anorexic. this is stupid. i know my boyfriend wouldn't care that i'm not popular, but itd bother me. i dont know what it is. i just dont want everything to be ruined....but i dont know what to do....
20090304195642AANqkRu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend just broke up with me?	Boyfriend told me he wanted to take a break with our relationship because he said I deserved someone who would have more time for me and he did not. Because he JUST started a new sport and its everyday now. And I could barely see him. But he told me to go out with other guys. He text me the next day asking why some of his friends thought we broke up. I told him he made it unclear to me and it seemed like you were telling me it was over because you wanted me to date other guys. He told me he was kidding because he wanted to see what I would do if I were single?! He just confused me so bad! He told me he wished he could be with me and everything and that he still cared about me. And to do whatever I want by the start of the summer when he will be free?! I am so confused. Oh and the night of the day he ^Broke up^ (took a break) with me or whatever. He held my hand and then kissed me. That was after. Help!?
20090304201007AApkC8c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do guys say another girl is hot in front of their girlfriends?	My boyfriend does this a few times a week (trying to make me jealous??) and I usually just ignore it until today. He said that his friends told him the new girl at work was hot and when he called me later tonight he said, "Oh, yeah? So that new girl IS hot!" Now it's starting to really bug me.       But WHY to guys do that? Are they (or you) just trying to make us jealous? Because if so, that's really lame and wicked annoying.

20090304192647AARsuGh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you deal with your partner being attracted to other people?	I asked my boyfriend if he imagines himself having sex with other hot women and he admitted that he does. He said it's just a fleeting image in his head and then he brushes it aside. I don't know why, but it really bugs me, partly because I don't have the same graphic fantasies about other people. Going out in public is kind of uncomfortable now because I suspect he's fantasizing about the hot women we see. He's 23 and I'm 26. What should I do?

20090304184051AAz0g4n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Talking to a shy guy?	I like this one guy and we've become friends...after some time I told him I liked him and wanted to be more than friends, and he said he would too! He's never had a gf and is kind of a quiet guy. When we talk we don't run out of things to say but I just feel like we don't talk enough and I would really like to hang out with him. How can I make it more comfortable to talk to him and eventually get him to ask me out? I've already made a lot of the moves (I asked him to formal and told him I like him. But he sent me chocolates on valentine's day...aw!), and I don't think it's a good idea for me to ask him out. What do you think? He's not the type of guy that just hangs out with friends, I think he always has some sort of purpose. help? We're 15.
20090304192403AA2tIyk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy problems care to help?	So a little over a month ago there was this dance. At the dance my friends and I met a couple of guy from an all-guys school, and traded numbers. Two of them I kept in touch with, one I went out with for a little while but I realized he was weird so I broke up with him after like 5 days. Then the other one, who was more attractive and fun to talk to, kept talking to me, until eventually we started going out.      But now my ex is still obsessed with me (and he's still weird!) and my the other guy I went out with for a week and a half broke up with me. He was pretty awkward (but SO nice and hot) so I was working hard on cracking his awkwardness. I had gotten past it a couple times, and I was getting really close, but he broke up with me. He used the whole it's not you it's me I'm too busy with lacrosse in the spring excuse, but I have a feeling its not legit.      Also, I've been talking to another one of his friends, and he was like "What?? Where did that come from??". According to him my bf was really into me and this break-up came out of no where. He was really shocked.      Do we have any chance of getting back together? Does he actually not like me or was this just an impulse decision or was he legit too busy with lacrosse? What should I do?

Im a teeneged girl in grade 12, Im new to my high school, theres this guy on my basketball team who I think likes me. Practice is only once a week though so I only see him Fridays, he asked me for my msn 2 months ago and we have only talked on msn like maybe 5 or 6 times tops, but only like 30 mins or less. We're both online at the same time every night but he just doesnt say anything. On Fridays in person everything seems the same and he shows the signs so why doesnt he talk to me on msn? He doesnt seem that shy in person but I also heard him telling his friend that hes never had a gf before so maybe hes shy about it?      Also, if I say hi 1st he does answer me all the time, but I mean he like never says hey 1st so I dont say anything coz I dont always want to be the 1st one to say it.

20090304191844AA4lhOn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Intelligent Ladies I'd like your classy point of view: Is she being sly or what?	am a freshman in college.So I walked up to a girl that I have a few classes with, and said to her "i went to class but we didnt have it" and she laughed and said "you should give me your number so i can remind you when theres no class...I text all the time" She had previously found me once before and said my name (we had never really used each others names before) and told me we had no class on another occaision. SHE ALSO remembered something I said in class (the topic of my essay) and when i brought something similar up she said "you always talk about that dont you". And we laughed alot the other day after this conversation, and said bye. Does this girl just think of me as friends or what? Why the heck would she ask for my number if not?
20090304190633AAxcMIk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Crush Probs... Does he like me???? Confused...  :(?	Well... there's this guuuy... :) Haha. Well, anyways, we've known each other since the fifth grade (Now we're in eighth) and it seemed like he liked me in fifth cuzze would always brag to me that we are both asian and blush and all that jazz. Haha. And in 6th he would tease me alot and try to act all cool and stuff. 7th we didn't have any classes together except for p.e. and the girls and boys were always separated, so the only time I really talked to him was this one time when my p.e. class and I were playing golf and the guys were running loops and he came up to me and asked if he could try and I said sure and he hit it really far and it kinda seemed like he was trying to impress me a lil and after I told him how good he was I toldem that his voice changed and he blushed, looked down, smiled, and was all yeeeeeeaaaaahh.... then the p.e. teacher told him to get lost and that was the end of that love story. LOL. JK! Now, in eighth, he always says hi to me while I see him in passing periods and whenever everyday, and I would always smile and say hi back. :) Also, he used to playfully block my way to the locker room too and I started liking him.... but then he stopped for a little while and I got kinda sad. :( But now he waves and says hi again. :) And today I had to stay in my math class late to finish up a test and he T.A's for the next period and I got up to turn in my test and it was all quiet and he smiled and said (a little loud) Hi *Ariana!. And yess... you guessed what I did next. :D And this morning I went in for extra math help and I saw him there helping a group of guys (He's in advanced) and I guess he's pretty good at it and I was thinking that maybe he could tuor me.... :) But I want to get to know him better and get more in the friend zone b4 I askem that and get his number cuz I always get to know guys alot better through texting for some reason. But idk if he's liked me all these years and he is just shy or if he doesn't or what. Btw, he doesn't act the way he does for all his other girl buds like he does to me. He's very outgoing and has no problem being open and funny with the rest of them... so I just don't know what's going on... :( Talk about mixed signals huh?

20090304200815AAhfJkC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When should my boyfriend meet my parents?	I have been dating my boyfriend for over 2 months now.  We are very serious and know we are going to spend the rest of our life together.  I am 25 and he is 28.  He already meet my brother before we told many people about us dating.        At first when my family found out about us a month ago they were not very accepting, but over the last month they seem more and more open minded and want to give this guy a chance.  I really want him to meet my family as he is the most important thing to me but I don't want anything to go wrong.        My parents and definitely my Dad and brother are ready to accept him but my Mom still has small issues.  The other thing is that I am Asian Indian and he is of European descent and that is the problems my Mom had at first.  Now it seems she is just have general parental hesitations now, not about me marrying or dating inter-racially.

I been with this guy casually off and on for about 1/2 a year, and he's leaving soon to go and work for a couple of months on the other side of the province. When we are together we have such a good connection, but whenever I ask him to hang out something with his friends come up, and it frustrates him and he cancels with me. He wants me to email him and he's changed it so that he gets his emails right away so we can still chat but he has alot on his plate right now that I feel that I am just adding more stress by showing interest in him, because he is leaving soon. Should I just leave him alone and if he wants to spend time with me than let him approach me. Do guys really keep their distance from girls they like so they don't get hurt?

20090304191205AAd7JC9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I know if my teacher likes me?	I get very high grades in school, I have a 4.0 GPA,but I am also very weird and social. I am in grade 12. My teacher, in his mid twenties I believe, often makes jokes about me and my various idiosyncrasies. I was working in his classroom one day, alone, and he left then came back telling me that he was such a mess, but then said I was a mess too. I know he was just kidding though, he didn't actually mean it. Then he always just makes funny small jokes about me. He's also not a teacher who likes everybody or who is really friendly and outgoing, so its very surprising for him to be so nice to me. He makes funny teasing jokes and I laugh all the time because he's hilarious. I think I'm the only student who really likes him. Everyone else finds him too discplined   Anyway, does this mean anything? Should it?

She told me that she had really little time between her trips and that she was actualy also going to Boston during springbreak (she did not tell me that before). She asked me how long I was thiking our trip would be. I feel like she does not want to go anymore, I am so sad. What do you think?

20090304192747AAjd6lv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Physical abuse is clearly wrong against women, but do you believe that men suffer emotional abuse?	Men receive rejection and emotional abuse from women througout their lives. it's almost inherent from the nature of the sexes, but a man can not go to a nightclub or even a mall without feeling the rejection, and women end 2/3 of relationships. Sure, it doesn't compare to physical abuse, but does it at least deserved to be mentioned?

20090304202529AAx7n1O	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When a person had a broken heart and opted to remain single until s/he die, should you just leave it that way?	No matter how her friends and family convince her, she was still strong to her vows. Even though there had been guys who had earlier expressed their feelings to her.. she remained uninterested. What should you do to those people? When all advises and concerns have been expressed, still she remains to close her heart to anyone else and just tries to be happy about her singleness. She’s already 38… a teacher, still beautiful, single, love less, childless. It would have been better if she will have someone to grow old with.. And some kids of her own who’ll have probably have her semblance and height.  Should you just respect her decision? It was already like more than 16 years since her heartbreak with a man who didn’t pursue their relationship.

20090304222908AAm0gOH	Family & Relationships;Friends	Lost contact with an old freind.......... again... what to do?	Well we were best friends from 3rd-6th grade, when she moved away. I'm 28 now. I ran into her at the grocery store last year and we started talking and went to lunch once a week. After the two huricannes here (gustave and Ike) we lost touch.  She never called me again. I know she is busy as a legal secretary and she has 2 beautiful kids to care for.      Thing is I was always the one to call her.  She might have called me one time out of 4 months.  So when I did call her I just felt like I was interfering since she never really called me. (We exchanged #'s at the store and it took me 2 weeks to call her, I just wished she would have called me). I live in a lower land area than her and would have expected her to check up on me after the huricannes flooded our area.  I guess I was kinda "testing" her. She never called of course.  It's been 5 months now.  Should I get over it and call her, or is she just to busy for me? I'm scared of being let down again, but should I take the risk anyway?

We work together.  He looks at my emails immediately.  He doesn't email anyone else.  He said it brightens his day to get my emails.  He isn't a known flirt.  Maybe he is just addicted to emailing, not attracted to me?  Our emails are just general emails, shooting the breeze, nothing sexual.  He shows me other signs he is interested in me, but not big signs.  We're friends, but not close friends.  Thx.
20090304212533AAOczVQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get him to just shut up?	I'm a single woman in my 20's living on my own. I work 40 plus hours a week. I have a friend who is a little older, he doesn't work and has pretty much everything paid by the government (says he is disabled, but I'm starting to doubt that). He's friends with this girl, that I have never even met, who also doesn't work and has everything paid for by the government too.       Every single day that I have off, they want me to go to her house. I keep telling him that I have very little free time, and when I do get some free time I normally have to spend it taking care of my apartment, running errands, paying bills, going to the bank, doing laundry etc. He doesn't seem to get it, and I have to tell him, maybe if I didn't work either and didn't have bills to pay I'd have as much free time as you do too.      Tonight he calls again telling me I need to get over there this weekend and play cards instead of just hiding out in my apartment all the time. I have a kitten who got very sick a few days ago, and had to be taken  to the vet and have emergency surgery on her stomach, so the last 3 days I have slept 5 hours  total between that and going to work, so I'm a little irritable. I kind of snapped, and said look I work, I'm busy, I have things to do around my home, bills to pay unlike you and hung up on him. I know  that probably wasn't the right thing to do, but he just doesn't get it, that I can't spend every little free second running over to someones house that I don't even know.      How can I let him know that I got a job and don't have the government doing everything for me, so he needs to back off? I've tried talking to him, but he just insisits that all I do is sit in my apartment when I'm not at work?      Thanks

The county child support office told me they can't do anything unless I give them the exact st. address.

20090304224815AAMG1e6	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What did I have to do with it?	I'm 16 now and my dad died when I was really little so I don't remember him. My mom took down all of his pictures so I never had an idea how he even looked. My mom and I really never have and I don't know if we ever will get along. Well,we got into a stupid fight over where I parked my car(she claims I was too far over). Anyway, I guess she either let it slip or wanted me to know that the reason she wants nothing to do with me is because I look so much like my dad. I have no recollection of him at all and she won't let me see a picture so I don't know. My response to her telling me this was, "What did I have to do with it? I can't control how I look." After that she walked away and we haven't said a word to each other. I'm pretty much confused on what I'm supposed to do. What was I supposed to say to being told that?
20090304204503AAmyj9o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Could someone please answer! im desperate, what should i believe?	We liked eachother a year back..but i lied to him about the people i liked. So he got rele mad at me. Now a year later...we don't speak at all..and hes had a girlfriend since...and ive had a boyfriend...we are both broken up with our bf and gfs now. His gf was being a bit of a jerk to him so he talks about hating her..but he always seems to tie me into the conversation and starts talking about how much he hates me. He won't let it go and he just keeps bringing me up. Things between us are really awkward..he can't look me in the eyes and whenever we talk he smiles a lot..I've tried talking to him...and asking him if we could just forget about everything that happened so long ago and just start over...but things are really really awkward. He told other people that he can not forgive me anymore..What do you think is going on in his mind...I'm really confused.   P.S. I write for the school newspaper...and he always reads my stuff...and hes not really into that whole thing.

20090304211511AAlVcOW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls are making my sad now!?	I had my first girlfriend around a year and a half ago. It was one of my friends from church that I've known for a while. The date didn't work out for more than a month. Then we kept a month apart, and out of nowhere we became friends again. It was an on-and-off relationship of telephone calls, where she was calling me most the time, and while we were dating it was the other way around. Later the next school dance came, I tried to take her to a school dance. We even planned it. She cheated on me. Started dancing with a macho know it all dick-head the whole time, never even spoke to me.      But none of those events are involved with the question. Now, girls are making me very sad. It's really weird. Married female teachers, teenage mothers, and even new-born daughters just make me blue. I feel like all women are repelling from me, and I just need to stick to being alone. Sometimes I even wish I was homosexual, so I wouldn't have this emptiness. Does anyone honestly know what's coming over me? This may be a hard question to answer, but please, do the best you can. And no jokes.
20090304224438AAVhlm9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PSYCHOTIC BF Threatened to beat me up?	I wanted to dump my boyfriend because of the way he's been acting. Saying he's busy hanging out with girls at 4am and he is always with his FRIENDS always! and PLUS THIS GUY IS A PSYCHO We live an hour and a half away. Anyway I told him that I was sick and tired and I needed a break and he went BERSERK started yelling and cussing at me and then he threatened to come to my house and "beat the crap out of me". He came all the way and stood outside my house for an hour waiting for me to get down. I cant call the police that is out of the question not because of him but just family issues anyway calling the police will get me into more trouble. He has physically abused me once before gave me a good old bruise. I cant go to university because everytime I do he is out there in the parking lot waiting. The last time I left my house with my chauffeaur he stopped the car opened the door and pulled me by the hair and slapped me across the face and screamed that I supposedly am going to marry him whether I liked it or not. I dont know what to do I just want him to leave me alone, he is this big shot in my country and the police basically cant touch him. He even WIRE TAPPED MY PHONE CALLS I had to use a different number to talk to my friends I dont HAVE ANY PRIVACY. Anytime I go out he send his body guards to follow me around malls. I need to do something.
20090304210603AAcox7a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm miserable I REALLLLLLLY Need ur help. Its LONG though. I need a wide abundance of GUYS and GIRLS to answer?	I am miserable. You know that pain you get in your heart when something bad happens? When you are really sad.I live with that feeling each and every day of my life. You know the tears and the headaches some of you may get...well that's a daily thing for me. I hate myself, and my life. I'm the quite girl no one notices,with a sweet personality and a smile on her face; who in secret is really hurting. I don't like being this way and I hate the fact I have to come on here for help.No one knows I feel this way.I don't want anyone to be or feel sorry for me. But everything I love goes bad and everything that makes me happy fades. I'm not always depressed I have alot of laughs and happy moments but in those times there is always a tinge, a small reminder saying "hey dude this ain't going to last. You weren't mean to be happy." I was fine a few minutes ago. A little upset but nothing past my usual regiment.But then my dad came in tipsy. He is a weird drunk. Slurs, makes weird and useless jokes. I got very upset at this and told him to talk to me when he could pronounce his sylabols corecetly. Well he got mad and started using things he does for me as an exscuse. "Oh well I got you a phone,and I pick you up from school."And I was like "Stop making exscuses that has nothing to do with this." Anyways well here I am crying again. I can't handle all this for 16. I won't accept discusing this with my parents, I've tried they don't change. No way am I going about this legaly.There is no guidence counclers and I have no money for a professional. High school is tireing. On top of that my cat is dying. Guys DONT EVER notice me and when they do seem to like me they don't do anything about it.They just stop and I know it's because they're embarassed to be seen with me, because I'm not as pretty as all these Florida beach babes at my school.It's like personality doesn't matter.I am a wonderful caring individulal.My personality is pretty. Maybe if I was invisable they'd think Iwas too. My parents are like kids I know they do pot. And don't get me wrong they're awesome and love me most of the time I just want a normal mom and dad to be strict and lay down the rules.I feel like a damn parent. My best friend of 10 years hasn't talked to me in 4 months; she ditched me for her Bf. And all my other friends have Bf's and a best friend.So I am left with self conscience issues, parents who act like kids no one to talk to.The only thing I had to keep me sain was my book I was writing, but then 3 other girls in my class started doing it too,and I over heard the teacher saying they were ahead of my skill Level.I hate living.I'm not dumb or ignorant enough to kill myself or even hurt myself for that matter, but I hate feeling this way.It hurts when you have no one and you have no self esteem and the people that should and I wish were here for me are gone. I'm alone.And sense guys obviously don't like me I'm sad,depressed, and afraid that I might be alone forever.   Apologies for the lenght of my rant.
20090304222916AAPLzg8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are girls turned on sexually when it comes to "being rough in bed"?	The girls I've been with tend to have a sexual preference of "being controlled" in the bedroom, they want to have no power.  One girl said "I like it abusive, it turns me on."

20090304224333AAVWTvY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies Only: Are muscular men more attractive?	I've recently started hitting the gym again for the first time in about three  years.  I bench 300+ now (325, in high school), my arms are 17", legs are built, back is built... I'm in college now and seem to be getting a lot more attention from the ladies.  My personality has remained the same: energetic and playful.  But I'm definitely getting a lot more eyes now that I'm 185 ripped and not 264 flabby.        My question is: Are women really this shallow?  I thought only men behaved this way.

Does he definitely like me/how do i get him to make a move?   1. we've gone out 3 times. but both of us have busy schedules making it difficult.      2. we usually talk on the phone every couple of days and for 30-45 minutes, but yesterday we talked on the phone for 2 hours!      3. he makes plans involving both of us for the future.      4. we have a lot in common.      5. he has said on multiple occasions, "well you're going to have to get used to (trait/characteristic he has), if we keep hanging out like this..."      6. i can see that he is a little shy but i can tell he has told me things he doesnt tell most people.      He is obviously a little shy to me so how do i get him to kiss me. both of us are too old to still be so childish like this but seriously i wont make te first move because im a little bit old fashioned so what should i do?

20090304211202AAdqjCd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would be a good way to get his attention?	I work at a hardware store in the paint department. Today there was this really good looking guy who came in. He saw me walk over to paint, and he came over there. He looked at me, and asked if he could get some help looking for something. My coworker who was standing with me said he'll show him where it is. But the good looking guy looked at me before he followed my coworker. Then when he walked by, he looked at me again. I was helping a customer and I could see him at cash, and he looked at me again. He also came in later. I'm really shy, especially when it comes to this. I live in a small town so its hard to meet guys cause there is nothing to do. I want to get his attention so he will come over and talk to me. Do you think he will? How do I do it? If I smile, should it be a big (but not too big) open mouthed? I'm 19 and a little self-conscious and I know I need to show a little confidence. My coworker said he seemed really nice. (I'm over thinking this aren't I?) He's usually at the lumber desk, which I don't work at, but to have to go over there occasionally.

Once, I was with a group of friends and they asked him if he wanted to come to the store also, and he said "Well, I guess if (my name) is coming" But it was kinda joking, you know. I guess I'm just confused. I brought hot sauce to this restaurant and he started like, bragging to everyone about how smart I was. Do you think he likes me? If so, what should I do?

Lets try this question in a different catagory! My husband and I were just married, he is 32 I just turned 31. He has this ultimate catholic school girl fantasy. He would loves for me to do it in the house but I am a little on the shy side of doing it OUT OF THE HOUSE but I know he would absolutely LOVE IT. I guess in a perfect world I would be dressed up and we would go out somewhere or do something. I have actually did this for a theme night at a club once but I think thats kind of different. I wore a pink plaid skirt from Charlotte Russe, white tube socks with the 3 stripes black stripes (like the ones on this page  http://skatersocks.com/25inchsocks.html  ), black nine west pointy toe 4 inch pumps and tied my white button down shirt up in a knot. We got home so late from boston and we were so tired nothing COULD happen. I felt a bit funny wearing this to the club but he thought it was so sexy and it was a theme night. Everyone said I looked hot though so that made me feel better and the club photographer constantly snapped pix of me. So Should I try this again (with out going to the dance club)? What do I wear? All the plaid-ish skirts I have are from Charlotte Russe and pleated. They are mini skirts but they dont show my *** but they are short. Should I wear a plaid skirt and white tube socks? Should I wear it with pumps again? Should I do it with these socks here that I have with a pleated plaid skirt  http://www.americanapparel.com/rsaskth2p...  with pumps? I also have these in just plain black  http://www.americanapparel.com/rsaskth7....  and can get them with just white or black with white stripes, the store is right down the road. I was going to wear a pair of these thigh high socks with my over the knee boots and the skirt and shirt or my knee high boots but I think that will take away from the catholic school girl look wont it? Those maybe for a completely different outfit and thats not a bad idea for going out actually now that I think of it!!! But I dont want to take away from the original look! But at the same time that may be a bit more classy? I have so many questions! WHAT SHOULD I WEAR? Where is it a good place to go dressed like this for him? Shopping @ the mall? Dinner? Movies? Can I get away with this? I kind of want to tone it down and not tie up my shirt and look like a hooker. But HELP Has anyone done this before in public? I have never seen it! I know this is Long and I have never emailed or did anything on here so Please be kind!! Oh and to answer, yes I am attractive, 5'10 140lbs. Blonde hair past my shoulders 1/4 way down my back, blue eyes...My legs are really long

I have been going out with her for 2 months. She claims they are only friends, tried the relationship, and it didn't work so they are strictly friends.      He is driving 2 hours to see her. They are having dinner, and she doesn't want me to come along because she claims it would be awkward.      I really Love this girl, but this could be a dealbreaker. Any thoughts?
20090304205324AAY1Tte	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this sound like a date to you?	This guy and I are in a play together (college play), and usually we'll joke around and he'll flirt (but he flirts with every woman/female). I don't like him in that way, I see him more as a friend, and don't take his flirting seriously. He also currently has a girlfriend. Anyway, today during rehearsal he asked if I'm free tomorrow after rehearsal (any job, more classes to go to, etc...) and I told him that I don't. Then he asked if I would like to get something to eat afterwards. And then he said to make sure I wear black shoes (O...k). I'me 20, but I've never been on a date before, plus he currently has a GF, I don't really like him in that way, and I wanted to wait til someone I really liked possibly asked me out (I know, it may never happen, but still). I didn't want to say no cause I didn't want to hurt his feelings, but at the same time, I feel very unsure and scared. Do you think this sounds like a date or anything?      Thanks!

20090304210133AAt8SUA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm a senior and I like a freshman...?	There's this freshman girl in band with me (we're both in the top band, overachieving azns ^_^), and I've taken quite an interest in her. It started when she started staring at me.      Well here's the thing. If it was any other freshman who liked me, I would just sorta mess with them a bit and laugh, and that's what I was gonna do with this girl... that is, until I started to realize I was looking at her a little more than usual, slurring my speech in front of her, blah blah blah you know the signs.      It started from "hmm, why is she staring at me?" to "I'm gonna mess with her" to "she looks nice," and then I started to really take an interest...      So the question is, is this normal? Like, I'm cool with freshmen and I'm not a hater like some of my friends are, but I'm feeling socially oppressed on the topic of hanging out with her more and more. I'm really amicable and am considered very friendly and open, and I guess people wouldn't mind. But really, a freshman? Sounds weird to me, but I like her so much...

What happens if you give a guy your number and you IM back a forth for a little bit but he never gives you a call? Usually I'm the one who says hi first and it's hard because I might really like him if I got to know him but he never calls me, IMs me first, or texts me. Could it be that he doesn't really know you yet and is finding the right time to call or text me. Or is it because he's just not that into me?
20090304223105AAdsUFu	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding Ceremony on a Different date?	I have a question that I'm very unsure of.  Basically my Fiancée  and I want to get married now and then have the ceremony in November.  Is that a bad thing?  I'm not sure yet.  We want to get married for insurance purposes....  well basically, i have a tooth that needs fixed, and it's gonna cost a lot of money that we can't afford.  I want the tooth fixed before the wedding because I really don't want the Pictures to come back showing my tooth problem forever.  But if we get married first, then I can get it fixed and save us nearly 2 grand.  This is a big factor considering we are the ones funding the wedding.  This was my Fiancées idea and we planned on getting married in November anyway, but I'm not sure.  What would you  do?

I like this girl I work with and asked her out to a movie Friday night (watchmen). she agreed. she is my supervisor. well I am not sure if she sees it as a friend thing or a date. last night we worked together and before we got off she asked me what I was doing. I said nothing, then she asked if I wanted to ride with her across town and back. would she ask me that as a friend or that she is interested in me? Keep in mind she never talks to anyone we currently work with on the phone. Im not pushing the situation, but last night when I rode with her she said that she has this BF that her family says she should leave. I said you should move on with me! and she giggled. then I changed the subject. What do yall think I would appreciate some input.
20090304223536AAupbEB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How would you interpret his feelings?	I'm curious as to what to do.      Here are the basics:      One of my best friends has recently started dating a friend. He's one of her best friends. He asked her to be his "Valentine", then they started dating the few days before Valentine's Day. She was unsure as to whether or not dating him would be a good thing, but she decided to take the risk.      He has a reputation of being a flirt. A HUGE flirt, to be honest. He said that he would turn over a new leaf after he started dating my friend. I believed him in the beginning [they've been dating for approximately three weeks], but now another friend and I are suspicious as to whether or not he's truly feeling those "dating-like-feelings" towards [girl number one]. I understand flirting can be pretty harmless; I generally wouldn't worry about it. It's just that, I wonder if he's thinking about or crushing on someone else.       Prior to dating my friend, this guy would be all... touchy with many girls. He would not quit hugging me. You know how guys would wrap their arms around a girl's waist from behind? He kept doing that to me. A few of my friends think that he may have actually liked me [go figure], and that he is only dating our friend to get me jealous [ahh, the conspiracy theory]. I highly doubt it [mostly because I have low self-esteem, hah], but it's really weird how he acts when she's not there. He's very... affectionate with others [ahem, girls] when she's not around, and is totally, hmm, contained, when she's there.       It's also a little strange that he wasn't majorly affectionate towards her before they dated, and he still isn't. Since it's him, it's quite an anomaly, Goodness, he's hugging and rubbing on chicks he's not dating, and I know he would've done that to other girls. Maybe he's trying to keep her virtuous, but I don't know if he'd think of that. Oh, and it's strange how he still keeps hugging me and holding me. Ugh, he said I'm the substitute when our friend is gone. That has got to be significant.      So, what do you all think?

If you spend 12 hours a day working with people, associating with them, will their behavior rub off on you?   My husband works with nothing but men who cheat on their partners, and just have no class at all. They're downright white-trash. I trust my husband right now, but will the continued exposure to bad people like this corrupt my seemingly perfect loved one?    I really dislike the class of people he is always around and I do wish they were better men; it just so happens that they aren't great husbands/boyfriends.    I know that everyone is different in these situations, this is just a possible thought.    What are your experiences?

I am in the same class as all of my close friends, which is good. But lately my best friend has been acting really weird about the whole ditching thing. I like to get to class on time, so sometimes i like to walk to my classes by myself. My best friend cracked it with me because i didn't wait for her. I didn't excactly leave her alone, she walked with other people from our class, but she still cracked it with me. I don't see how this is bad i mean its just class! Now i have to wait for her even if im late for class and wait till she stops stuffing around and gets her act together. Also the other day, she went up to a teacher and talked about her work, this was after her graphics class, i was going to get in trouble waiting, so i headed off to class. I went to my next class and sat down, she came up and slammed her books on the desk and yelled at me, saying i ditched her and im mean and that she is annoyed with me. I got upset and started crying, i may sond like a sook, but i am so tired of this. I have told her, i don't mean to ditch her but she keeps saying i do! what am i doing wrong! how can i get this to stop!

20090304235016AAhLO1l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help a someone in love?	I am falling in love with a female friend who is already taken by someone.    We met 2 months ago at a New Years Eve party, during which time we had a conversation for over 4 straight hours. I immediately felt the chemistry and have been close friends with her since. One day I asked her on a date, but she rejected me, saying that we can only be friends. Having never felt so strongly and deeply about anyone before, I was confused and upset. It almost felt like our friendship was coming to an end, and that I would never be able to find a woman as exquisite, intelligent, caring as her. However, after a bottle of tequila and a week later, I regained my confidence and we finally started to talk to each other again. Little did I know, the worst had yet to happen.    One day she asked for my help on something, so I agreed to meet her. When I saw her, I felt very tempted to tell her how much I care about her, but I knew it would have been futile. She could simply not reciprocate it at the time. Little by little, we talked about our families, hobbies, and whatever else that came to our mind, until she told me about her current boyfriend. Certainly, there were mixed feelings inside of me. On one hand, I was relieved because I speculated that she rejected me for this exact reason, meaning that anything can still happen after they break up. On the other hand, I was even more upset, mainly because we have such a good chemistry, and the fact that she turns to me for help. This has led me to believe that her lucky sob boyfriend is a big tool. Now, here I am, weeks later, unable to stop thinking about amazing it would be to hold her hands in public or kiss her. For sure, we have become really close friends, but I badly want us to be a couple. Thanks in advance for reading thus far. Please give me any ideas you have on how I could win her heart.

So she usually just stands by herself before we're let into the classroom and she seems like a pretty quiet person.      I have a couple of close friends in our class. I want her to join our little group. I'm wondering, how should i approach her? I don't want her to feel "alone" and she seems like she would be a great friend.       Before class, should i just go up to her and say something?   Because she doesn't know me and i don't really know her. Should i introduce myself? Suggestions please?

I already apologized a bunch of times, and I claimed responsibility for what I had done, and I don't know what to do now.
20090304234739AAqcGS9	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How do you get over cold feet!?	Ever since today started I have been getting cold feet which is really odd.   My friend walked up to me today and said "aww you're getting married in a month!" and I just froze like ohhh myy godddd.   And ever since then I feel really strange about the whole thing. Like I can't wait to marry him and I love him and know he's the one but... marriage all the sudden seems so scary like this dark unknown place.      How do you overcome this? It's not like a huge huge problem but it's still been bugging the crap out of me all day and I have a feeling it's not gonna go away overnight. Dang I wish my friend never said that lol.

20090304231818AA3C95z	Family & Relationships;Weddings	So I need some idea about my wedding..easy question =)?	We are marrying in a church which is about a 10 minute drive away from the banquet hall where our reception is..We are booked to start the reception at 6pm so when should the ceremony begin? We need an hour in between for photos...Should I talk to the guy at the hall about getting in a bit earlier..like 5? Then if the ceremony ends at 4pm we could take off and do our photos and people could be in at 5. This was originally going to be at 2pm our ceremony? Is that ok...Everyone is out by 2:45 or 3pm at the church is 3 hours to long especially for out of towners? What can I offer in between?

Colour cardboard paper with whitepaper squared inside of it with beautiful text ( I can just print the pages on the computer ) and perhaps some design I can do something simple and elegant in photoshop   Then I would make smaller cards for RSVP etc and buy some nice envelopes to put them in. And I would also buy ribbon to tie around the invitations and they would open up like a book with each one inside.

20090304231948AAsJ0zB	Family & Relationships;Family	Just looking for opinions/advice.. please?	So heres the situation.. A lot of it started over this summer, in july, my grandma passed away.  She was like the glue of our family, held us all together, she was my mother figure, she raised me.        Well she had been sick for a very long time, so everyone saw it coming.  At the time it happened, it seemed like we would all get through this together as a family, but things didn't work out like that.  At first we tried to keep things going as a family, but things so stupid as money got in the way.        My grandpa, the greatest man i know, recently started seeing someone else and getting serious right away in October.  She is a great woman though, very cultural, very nice, and most importantly she gave my grandpa life again.  I seen him after my grandma passed away, he was so lifeless, so sick, like he was heading right there with her.  Now he looks and feels alive again.      My mom, and her 2 brothers, my uncles, have so much anger though, they're still grieving i understand that so am i.  They say so many mean things to him and his now fiancee, how could they be so mean?  After everything my grandpa has done for them, my 2 uncles mainly, they are potheads, they can't keep a job, always lived off of my grandpa.  He was always there for them even though they treat him horribly now, if they needed 20$ here, he gave it to them.  Most of all when they went to the hospital which is 2 hours away from our home, he payed for their gas/food/hotels.  My grandma was the same way with them, they always took care of them even as adults.  Now they say mean things about him, act like they can't trust him.  My mom isn't "as" bad, but she is still just as mean, she is more independent when it comes to money, but when it came to babysitting my grandma and grandpa always watched my 2 little sisters, and me when i was younger, just so she can go out and get drunk, they were all raised better than that.  Now all they do is say stupid things like calling her a gold digger, saying she is living off of grandma's money, and she can't stand anything that was grandma's and hate all the grandkids.  All of that is so untrue, if she couldn't stand grandkids why did she welcome me to live with her and grandpa and be a part of their life.  She talks so openly about my grandma with me and my grandpa.  She respects her so much.      I have lived with my grandpa and grandma much of my life, and currently live with my grandpa once again, and his fiancee, and now i hear things that make me sad about it.  When i lived with my mother, things were horrible, all we did was argue, i was so depressed i didn't even go to school.  Now that im living with my grandpa and his fiancee, who i am close to calling grandma, i am back in school, also feel alive again, i get all A's and B's in school and have a future for the first time i feel so good.  Yet, my mom tells me i'm back to "living off of my grandpa."  Why would she say that i am only 15 years old.  She says i am being brainwashed and getting an attitude, only because i am finally speaking my mind and telling her what i don't like about her.  I love my mom dearly, but she hurts me so much.  Even as a kid, she never showed affection for me, and we never talked much.      Why are they being so mean to my grandpa? why do they hate him so much right now and don't want to get over their stupid anger towards him.  My grandpa has been through enough why the **** do they think he deserves not only his own pain, but theirs too.  He will never forget grandma and tells me that often, he tells me that him and my grandma talked about this long before she was even sick, when my mom was small even, they talked about if anything ever happened to either of them, just to move on, and live life.  He loved my grandma, he loved her for almost 40 years (and they were both only in their mid 50's when she died.)  So why do my mom and uncles not want him to be happy?        I hate this so much i want everything to be ok it makes me so sad when i think about it.  I know i'm going to do well in school and in life, i promised my grandma that right before she passed away and i live by that promise.  It murdered me inside to see her take her last breath, and now my mom and uncles think i didn't care as much as i should have.  Just because i moved forward in life just like she wanted me to means i didn't care? what is going on in their minds please help me.       I apologize for the long long question, and thank you all so much who read it all.  I deeply appreciate any answers and advice, thank you

While we were having our exams, some of my classmates kept copying my answers but I couldn't copy from them.

20090304232433AAR56Sv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP!! Can someone give some safe "date" food??? PLEASE!!?!?	I am going out on a date with this really great guy. We aren't teenagers anymore so first impressions are extremely important. Of course I have met him before, we know each other really well and we are really good friends. He is everything to me, so I want to make a really good impression for him. :)      But what are good "date" foods?? I can't eat a sandwich because restaurants normally make them huge so I'll make weird unladylike faces while I am eating it. Plus some of the sandwich may fall on my plate or stick out of my mouth while eating. :S      A salad is out of the question because they never cut the lettuce small enough, so at some point I am destined to have lettuce sticking out of my mouth. How unattractive!   Spaghetti is a definite no-no...      So what am  I left with.... soup??      Please help me! I have managed for 20 yrs to avoid dinner dates for this very reason. Now it is unavoidable. Please tell me what is safe to eat on a date. What is the most ladylike meal I can order?      I realize this question may seem absurd to most of you, but please, this is something I have always worried about. I purposely have not been on a dinner date, because I am afraid of what will happen or what I will look like while eating. :S

20090304230319AAX8dKz	Family & Relationships;Family	What was I supposed to say after being told that?	I'm 16 now and my dad died when I was really little so I don't remember him. My mom took down all of his pictures so I never had an idea how he even looked. My mom and I really never have and I don't know if we ever will get along. Well,we got into a stupid fight over where I parked my car(she claims I was too far over). Anyway, I guess she either let it slip or wanted me to know that the reason she wants nothing to do with me is because I look so much like my dad. I have no recollection of him at all and she won't let me see a picture so I don't know. My response to her telling me this was, "What did I have to do with it? I can't control how I look." After that she walked away and we haven't said a word to each other. I'm pretty much confused on what I'm supposed to do. What was I supposed to say after being told that?

20090305000133AAZ1TAo	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would you drop it or would you fight for it?	There is one person that I really want to talk to, but she refuses to add me to any of her internet profiles. We used to be really great friends. I miss her a lot. We never had a falling out, but another "friend" told her I said nasty things. Instead of confronting me about these nasty words, my friend just simply cut all contact with me. Sigh! I wish I could take the person who said the nasty things by the collar and drag her all of the way down to my friends house to admit to her lies and deceit so that I could have my dear friend back. Or at least she'd know the truth and have a choice about things. It must of been really awful things said because this friend would normally have confronted me. Sigh! I have tried to communicate with my lost friend for some time now. Should I leave her be and consider it dead? (Please, no rude comments like "can't you take the hint") And this other person that did this, what should I do with her? Is there a way I can make my friend understand that I was misrepresented? She lives very far away from me, so communication has to be by internet, phone or mail.

He is still very attentive and talks a lot to me and as we have more to drink he gets a little "touchier", but no major moves and no asking for my phone number yet. What do you think?

20090304232840AADx4Yk	Family & Relationships;Friends	She bit me...now im even more confused. help!?	ok so i really like this girl. shes almost 18, im 19 and we work together.   i've been crushing on her for a while now and kinda tried to put it out there that i like her...without saying i do. shes probably the most confusing girl i've come to like...and i kinda like that.lol. anyway, i wasnt sure if she liked me or not so this other girl i work with kinda talked to her about me...and this is what i was told   1)shes got a boyfriend   2)she likes this kid we work with(stupid guy, stoner and drinker)   3)she told somebody to tell me that i didnt have a chance      so i hear that...im kinda bumbed. but i wanted to hear it from her to be 100% sure...so i asked her about it and told her no matter what i wouldn't be mad, that i just wanted to know.   and this was her response   "i don't have a boyfriend but its not that i don't like you i just am not really looking for a relationship right now! i really like you as a friend and an individual and im not saying you don't have a chance i just would rather have us be good friends! and im really sorry if that makes you mad :( "      i assured her that i was not mad, because hey thats better than i was led to believe.      now the confusing part:   after that conversation..we were at work and shes flirting with me again..and a little bit more too. at one point she slapped my ***.lol.   well so now im confused..because she said she would just rather be friends...yet shes flirting with me a little more every now and again...and a little but more intense at times. and then tonight at work..we were standing up at the host stand and i was talking to somebody...and she bit me on the shoulder.lol. i dont know of any girls who will playfully bite a guy except for when they like that guy...so idk.   any ideas on what i should be thinking or doing or whatever...would be greatly appreciated.lol

20090304225928AAwQcIJ	Family & Relationships;Family	Ok who is right me or my dad?	Ok so my dads computer broke today about an hour or two(or three or four you get the idea) after I used it. So who do my parents blame for this major disturbance (i'm talkin a major computer break to like you might need the geek squad)? They blame me of course! Ok first you should know what I was doing on this computer....I was on youtube. I am not lying I just watched youtube videos for about half an hour. And the computer was having problems even before that night (we had to restart it a couple times...it's a mac by the way if it helps). I'll tell you how it started. It started with my dad wanting to run vista on his computer. So what's he do? He installed boot camp after it got outdated! He even had it on his computer (it's leopard) and he still got it from the website. Anyways he split his hardrive in half space wise and guess what? It didn't work! (I think he mighta blamed me for that too) So he has half the space and we all have to share it as a family computer since our windows computer was busted (this one I didn't get blamed for...SHOCKER RIGHT???) So yeah 4 people sharing one computer with half the space....bound to be a lot of other culprits for the computer breaking...especially since my brother tried to look up....i'll give you a hint it starts with a p and ends with a orn. But we're not here to talk about that. So I get blamed for it breaking when it was having problems a couple days before and I wasn't even touching it. And besides when I got off the computer it was FINE. It was running smooth as it had been (P.S. it sucks!!!). But of course my parents try to restart it for reasons I have no idea for. So guess what? It goes to the loading screen and then shuts down again. And they blame me and youtube.....really.... As far as I know there are no possible viruses on youtube. I did nothing but stay on youtube. I may have visited Yahoo! but as we all know....both are pretty safe. But of course it's my fault just because I was on last....yeah that makes perfect sense. And even afterwards I look my hardest to find a solution to fix it!!! And guess what I found one! But it turns out somethings wrong with the hardisk! (It had a folder with a question mark and a gray screen) So of course that's my fault....IT DIDN'T EVEN TURN ON BEFORE I TRIED FIXING IT. So we got that out the way what does my dad do next? He pops in the software cd that came with his computer....without even checking to see where the other one is. So of course he finishes the thing but then he reaches for disk two and realizes it's not their! So who does he yell at? Yours Truly! Seriously I think my parents have a thing against me. Ok I'm not owning up to something here. I admittadly have looked at the same stuff my brother has above. But seriously....13 years old....no girlfriend...been at a school with no hot girls for 3 years...you'd think that's more of an excuse than the 40 year old whose had to get 3 new computers cause of his addiction. And besides I only use my computer (haven't been doing it much on it....tryin to cut back). So now I can continue with my story. Where was I? Oh yeah my dad losing his cd and blaming me. Ok hears the story: A year ago when my computer broke (I don't know how or why I was using it midday and it crashed on windows it was a  mac). I borrowed the software cd he got with the computer that my parent think I broke (Boy this is getting confusing lets just call the computer I supposedly "broke" Computer F). The cd didn't work on my computer and I put it back in its place on the shelf (the weird thing is CD 2 of Computer F is gone and I used CD 1...) I know I did my job when he found it. But my dad didn't piece this part together. So ANOTHER accusation with no real evidence is made upon me. Hmmm how is this thing working??? So just when things can't get any worse he busts into my room at 10:15 on a school night when I was TRYING to sleep and starts searching my room and CD's for CD 2. Doesn't anyone ever knock anymore..... So right know I'm fuming over my dad and I'm going to tell him most of the stuff I wrote above because seriously...all the evidence points away from me. Computer F was already on its way to a game of chicken on trains. And anything I ever download (which was nothing but mp3's from a reasonably safe source and video's directly from youtube with NO VIRUSES) has been checked and no viruses have emerged. This is really making me mad and now I can't sleep from the anger. The question is who is right Me or My Parents/Dad and why?
20090304231323AAYmPAb	Family & Relationships;Family	Why don't my parents go visit my brothers grave?	My brother committed suicide when he was 14 ( 7years ago) I want to go visit his grave but I don't wanna make my mum cry. We never visit his grave we only went to it when he was getting buried wtf is my parents deal?
20090304231521AATb4Vx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Been communicating with ex-should i mention...?	Dealing with my bf bitter ex has been hard. They have a toddler daughter together who he is not allowed to see without her being there as well. She has always hated me (even before she met me) and claimed her daughter would "never be around me." We have tried everything to change this situation, offered to get signed up for child support, had TONS of visits (on a pretty regular basis), bought her clothing, food, diapers, presents, etc. Let his ex come to EVERY family function just so that his daughter could be there, and BELIEVE that i have never been anything but nice to her since the day we met. (she wanted him back, and i felt sorry for her b/c they broke up way before we got together and she was still hanging on...obviously she loved him alot) Things really came to a head recently and him and her have stopped talking (they both said they werent ever going to budge-i.e. he wants visitation with her regularly, and she will not let him see her w/o her being there) and finally he decided that the only way to settle it was through the courts, but we are trying to save up money for a lawyer since it is obviously going to be a battle, just to get visitation. I should also add that she has a new man, and has for about...1 yr and a half? We have a son together who is 1 yr. old, and have been together for 3 yr. now. We do plan on getting married, but not until this situation has been sorted through.       After they stopped speaking with each other she started being really friendly to me on myspace (the only way she has to get in touch with me, really) and very recently we have been messaging each other back and forth over a video she posted of their daughter on myspace...(i said it was really cute and made me cry, etc. etc.) I was thinking maybe i should mention to her, that we would still like visitation and that we are willing to work out a plan to ease the transition, and beg for maturity on all of our parts for her sake. I know she is very bitter that he stopped talking to her, but maybe since we are "super best friends" now i guess, lol, i can reason with her on a woman-to woman level that he couldnt? i dont know..should i just stick to the non-essential things we have been conversing about (i.e. the video, and how cute i think their daughter is commenting on pictures, etc.) or should i get to the "real deal" (in a nice, reasonable way of course) or do you think this would just lead to more trouble?
20090304233004AA64Xxq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does a booty caller do this?	He travels 1.5 hours to get to me. He tries hard to remember my friends' names. He hangs out with me for hours the next day after he stays over (once until 6pm). He Facebook stalks me and adds some of my friends. He tells me about his family and friends. He introduced me to his cousin and his roommate, and he brought me to the bar he works at. He's barely fluent in English but tries really hard. He holds my hand in public, kisses me on busy street corners in broad daylight. He always pays, holds doors, put my coat on for me. He asks about my life, my interests, how my day went, etc. He's shy and I make him nervous, I can tell.      BUT...I met him 4 weeks ago and we've only been out twice. He hasn't taken me on a "date" or asked me to visit him. It's usually me asking him to come out with my group. He hardly calls (just texts...language thing maybe?). Today we had plans for him to come visit around 9pm, and I get a text at exactly 9 saying "sorry, forgot i had hockey and just finished playing, really tired, maybe see you tomorrow." We used to text volley every day up until about 5 days ago, but he still picks up when I call him and answers my texts, just doesn't initiate anymore. It can't be that we already had sex bc he kept it up long after. He's very attractive, but he doesn't have the confidence of a player. I know he doesn't have a gf, and he left some belongings at my place.      Is he trying to push me away now? Why would he keep giving me hope if he's losing interest? What should I do, forget about the unreliable guy? Ask him on a real date, but I've never asked a guy out before..? Plus I don't want to be the chaser here, guys like the chase or something right?      I'm so confused.
20090304230529AAnYh9X	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Sex, Fantasy, role play and rock and roll!?	Lets try this question in a different catagory! My husband and I were just married, he is 32 I just turned 31. He has this ultimate catholic school girl fantasy. He would loves for me to do it in the house but I am a little on the shy side of doing it OUT OF THE HOUSE but I know he would absolutely LOVE IT. I guess in a perfect world I would be dressed up and we would go out somewhere or do something. I have actually did this for a theme night at a club once but I think thats kind of different. I wore a pink plaid skirt from Charlotte Russe, white tube socks with the 3 stripes black stripes (like the ones on this page  http://skatersocks.com/25inchsocks.html  ), black nine west pointy toe 4 inch pumps and tied my white button down shirt up in a knot. We got home so late from boston and we were so tired nothing COULD happen. I felt a bit funny wearing this to the club but he thought it was so sexy and it was a theme night. Everyone said I looked hot though so that made me feel better and the club photographer constantly snapped pix of me. So Should I try this again (with out going to the dance club)? What do I wear? All the plaid-ish skirts I have are from Charlotte Russe and pleated. They are mini skirts but they dont show my *** but they are short. Should I wear a plaid skirt and white tube socks? Should I wear it with pumps again? Should I do it with these socks here that I have with a pleated plaid skirt  http://www.americanapparel.com/rsaskth2p...  with pumps? I also have these in just plain black  http://www.americanapparel.com/rsaskth7....  and can get them with just white or black with white stripes, the store is right down the road. I was going to wear a pair of these thigh high socks with my over the knee boots and the skirt and shirt or my knee high boots but I think that will take away from the catholic school girl look wont it? Those maybe for a completely different outfit and thats not a bad idea for going out actually now that I think of it!!! But I dont want to take away from the original look! But at the same time that may be a bit more classy? I have so many questions! WHAT SHOULD I WEAR? Where is it a good place to go dressed like this for him? Shopping @ the mall? Dinner? Movies? Can I get away with this? I kind of want to tone it down and not tie up my shirt and look like a hooker. But HELP Has anyone done this before in public? I have never seen it! I know this is Long and I have never emailed or did anything on here so Please be kind!! Oh and to answer, yes I am attractive, 5'10 140lbs. Blonde hair past my shoulders 1/4 way down my back, blue eyes...My legs are really long
20090304230702AAYHFsd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If my boyfriend's son is proven not to be his, will he still have to pay child support?	My boyfriend's ex is a witch, when her son, Brent was born my boyfreind signed the birth certificate half-believing that he was his. A year ago his ex took him to court to get child support, and the judge issued a paternity test be taken because my boyfriend was feeling skeptical. That same night his ex convinced him not to take the test and blah blah blah. So, stupidly he didn't. Now he tells me that there really isn't any way in hell that Brent is biologically his, due to his past with the mother. He and I have been talking frequently about buying an in-home DNA test, and we're both curious that if Brent turns out to really not be his, can he take it to court and the child support stopped?? The courts would go after the REAL father right?? They couldn't make him pay for a son that isn't his??

20070421002445AAIFccP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i know if i really like him?	i met this boy at a summer camp and i like him but he had a girlfriend, so i just treated him as a friend. I only realised that he liked me too and his relationship with his girlfrend was wobbly and they broke up few months after that. then he ask if i like him because he really like me. So i spend some time with him because i wasn't sure if i really like him and i never had a boyfriend before, so i was just making sure what do i actully feel for him and i was nervous. but i think i took too long to tell him my feelings. He thought i was playing with his feelings. he doesn't want to be my friend anymore. Everyday when i wake up will feel empty, like i had lost something and i miss him. So am i sad because i lost a friend or sad because i lost a boyfriend?

20070501045827AAPLS27	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it true that Mexicans are made up of 3 races?	I read the Olmecs, original people of Mexico, were of African descent.     Scholars say that the history of blacks have been erased or pushed aside.    I tend to agree. I was watching these 2 mexican kids on Youtube and one had more Spanish and Indian features, the other kid was a shade darker and had a more broader nose and thicker lips, he looked more puerto rican than mexican. Not that all blacks have these features. My point, they sort of looked like they had different backgrounds in their family history.    I am a mixed black guy. My mother is black but she has Mexican people on her side of the family. My father passes as a black guy but he has indian and white in his family. So, I just want to know part of MX's history because I see many mexicans who I mistake for mixed black guys or puerto ricans. Hope I didn't offend anyone.

20090304230230AALK1Ut	Family & Relationships;Friends	Guys I really need help!Is my friend insecure about being my friend, because I am not popular?	So I have a friend named (for now lets just say brendon, its not his real name) Brendon. We have been going to the same school since middle school, now we are in high school. We were good friends in the 6th grade and After he started to date alot of girls in the 7th grade he basically ditched me for the wanna be popular group of people. Which is basically all the slutty and fake girls who are mean, and everyone knows them but hates; yet they still get attention. Well anyways I am friends with some of the people there who are not mean, but i don't really hang out with them. But see I am not in that crowd. And this summer there was this program I signed up to and he was there. So I didn't really try to be his friend at all because I am really shy, and so I never said anything. But eventually we became extremly good friends and we have alot in common. When we rode the bus together going home(he lives a few blocks away from me) one of his friends was with us and kept teasing brendon on how he was flirting with me. But it didn't really seem like it cuz we just talked about ordinary stuff (you can say he put a true face.) I heard from people that he was going to ask me out, but there was another guy who liked me and I understand brendon for not asking me out because he wants to stay true to his friendship wih the guy (so i totally understand, and respect that. that doesnt bothr me though.) And when we got back to school, he basically ditched me in a way. If I saw him in the hallways we used to give me a hug and say hi. But then after a week or so he just stopped doing that, and occasionally he would talk to me only if no one is around or would text me later in the evening when none of his "popular" friedns are not around. And it really bothers me if wether I should even be friends with him, because if someone is self secure about being my friend then I dont want to deal with it.      Help what do you think and what should I do.       I prefer what guys have to say but if your a girl, go ahead and answer the question if something like this happened to you.
20090304230300AAqsaTw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Muslim Divorce(talaq)?	My husband used me to get a green card, both of us are from pakistan him and his family later mentally and verbally abused me and mistreated me and my son from previous marriage. All the dreams i had about finally having a family and a chance to go back and visit pakistan were shattered, he has cheated on my several times during 9 yrs with american women and he is a sex addict and a real good lier and an actor. He fooled me into marrying him with fake promisses and is never been sincere to me. He is tols me i  give you divorce 3 times during the argument where i confronted him about the co-worker he was sleeping with. He acts like a "Bagharat" after that and does not leave and still continues to live in the same house and tells me to get out. I have 2 kids and no family and he has got everything through me including immigration staus, credit, job, house even his name. Befor me he lived in united states illegally for 10 years and did not had anything on his name, no job no social security card not even his own name, he was living under a fake name and has already been turned down for green card for fraud case. He used me and does not appreciate anything i did for him, he denies everything and is a pathalogical lier and now when i am home raising kids with no job and career he tells me to get lost and leave his house he says everything is his because he has a job. This is a man when i met him had $ 600 in his pocket and was living with other people using their car  and had nothing,  and no right to live in this country or have a job. I have been blind folded over the years and been manipulated by him and now it is all becoming too much. i dont know how to put him back where he started from before he met me because that is what he deserves.

Okay, so, I went up to a girl that i really really like tonight and invited her to a get together that my Bible Study is having.

Anyway, I said to her at the end of the conversation "let me know when you are free and maybe I can take you out on a date sometime" and she said "yeah, maybe."   I'm afraid of what this means because I really like this girl and don't want to be hurt. Is that inevitable? What does it mean? Thanks!

20090304230749AAmksdK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Guys help...Do you mean it when you say "Lets just be friend?"...honest answer pls.?	My BF broke up with me and told me to move on and forget him. Then the following day he said, he will love me forever and his love will be there, but I hurt him many times. He said to stop sending him a message about my feelings, so I did. I tried not talked to him for 1day, then he called and asked me what did I do yesterday?    We still talk on the phone and he wud call me whenever I ask him to call me. He left to work on his visa.He called me before he left and now he send me a message from his home country.    I'm confused!   He once said he will still be the same, but except of not having him as a partner anymore. He still talk as if his my BF, except that he don't say anything about his feelings.   IT took me awhile to accept that were just friends now.    Is it possible to be a good friend with your EX?   Is it possible to loose your feelings for 3months after 3yrs of relationship?   Do you mean it when you say lets just be friend?
20090304230912AA6IwS6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She just want to be friends?	so i was talking to this girl that i like on the phone 2night. Basically i said to her that i don't know if i'm pursuing a faults hope by wanting to date her. We have been friends for a few mouth now and she is still trying to get over this guy (who is a good friend of mine) and she is still very attach to him. we have made out and we would kiss and hold hands. but this phone call she told me that she is still attract to this guy and she doesn't want a relationship right now. she told me she likes me and care about me but she doesn't want to lose me if we started dating. she still want us to be good friends tho and i I KNOW she means it. i told her that if she decided that then i will be a friends but without the physical actives like making out and stuff, in which she was completely find with. just two days ago when i was in her car i gave her a goodbye hug and got my face close to her and to test her if she would actually kiss me or not, she did so for 3time before i started to kiss her back. is this a nice rejection or she just wants to be friends with me because she need someone to talk to because she said she loves talking to me. we could tell each other everything so dose she see me as a protential best friends? Also she said she would still make out with me if i let her.

20090304231905AAbbUxP	Family & Relationships;Family	My dad died 14 years ago, and i still cant get over it?	I don't know what to do anymore. I feel silly for still being upset about it. Some times, i'll go into these crying fits where i find myself jerking around on the floor. He killed himself, and my brother says that he's scared cause i acted like him. Not in a i talk like him or laugh like him kind of way. But that one day i'm happy-go-lucky, and the next, i'm beyond the point of sad. He says that a lot of people who kill themselves, acted like that. And that that's how my dad acted just before he killed himself.      I am very scared, because i do find myself thinking about it from time to time when life becomes very hard to live for me. I ALWAYS tell myself to wait, to go to sleep and if its still just as bad in the morning, then i'll do it. Of course, its always better in the morning, and i never really mean it when i tell myself that. But really, is it normal for me to HAVE to tell myself that?      Is it normal for a 17 year old girl to fake a smile everyday? To just nod whenever someone asked if she's ok, when really she's nothing close to ok?      I know that i should go see a shrink or something, but that's not an option for me. I have little enough money as it is, and they have nothing around here that's free.      I wish i could talk to someone about this. But my mom just cries and goes into her room, or yells at me. (She has a hard time with it, i understand. No big.) My brother who's scared that i might do what my dad did, lives out of town, and blames my mom for it all. Which i hate, so i cant go to him either. And my other brother acts like my dad never existed. I did try telling a friend once how i've been feeling and all that. But she just called my mom, which made my mom upset. I got mad at her for telling my mom when i told her not to, and she wont talk to me anymore.      So i dont know...      Can anyone give me some advice on how to deal with this, or a way to make things a little better?      I hate to ask and just spill my guts to you all. But i've read some of the answers on here, and thought maybe someone could help.      If you can, thanks so much. If not, dont worry about it.
20090304232132AAJiPc0	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Dating an older man with kids, need help ...or suggestion?	I started talking to a older man ( notice i said man) back in September. I will call him Mr.Big. He has two boys, 7 and 13 and loves them to death. He is a very good dad, he has full custody, from football games to horror movie night he spends a lot of time with them... which has left me on the side. I grew up seeing my dad bringing home a lot of women and I hated that because I felt like he had no respect for us, our mother and himself. I do not want to ruin the good time he has with his boys but dammit I need some time with him.lol   We have not been intimate, he invited me over once to spend the weekend, but i said no because I was scared of what his kids would think of me. ( i know it's silly for some, but i was that kid who saw lots of women come in and out of the house) . When we first started talking, he noticed that i was not a sensitive person. And i am not , but for some reason with him it's different.    How can i get his attention without taking him away from his boys? Can he be scared of me not being sensitive?   This sucks, I may be falling for him :(

20090304233525AAB4aGS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In love but what do I do?	I'm gay and a guy I work with who has been with our team five months used to point at me with his hands or fingers or feet (once holding onto my partition at work with his thumb thrust out at me while talking to someone else at the next desk) this slowly stopped but now if he's sitting by me I notice he is leaning towards me.       I was standing by him the other day while he was sitting down and he started leaning so far towards me that his head wasn't far from my chest and his elbow was actually touching my hand. Then he pulled back and didn't refer to it again. If I try and copy him he gets embarrassed.       Is he just comfortable with me or is there an underlying motive?      He’s living with his boyfriend who I know gets very emotional and highly stressed but they are together. A few months ago he started flirting quite heavily with me and running his boyfriend down to me.       When he leaves me to go somewhere with his boyfriend he never really looks at me or says goodbye properly – if I try to say goodbye he speeds off which breaks my heart. He was talking to me normally for a short time just before he left the last time looking into my eyes and smiling then marches off saying abruptly he was going now and then leaves, I saw him saying goodbye properly to a colleague outside and didn’t seen to be in such a hurry then.      I am in love with him but I don't know if this is his way of telling me he loves me or is just comfortable with me or what really.       I just want to know if you think this behaviour means he feels the same way or am I deluding myself?      I have tried forgetting about him but it won't work - I tried yesterday but then he looked into my eyes and I went to pieces all over again. It hurts so much not to be with him and to know he is with someone. I want him to be with me and hold me.
20090304233638AAwnYh9	Family & Relationships;Friends	How should I act when I bump into my former best friend?	I was best friends with this guy, we went to school together, graduated and became business partners. We were very close for several years but about 1? years ago, we had a fallout. There were lies, deceit, betrayal and all this caused the rupture of our friendship and the end of his marriage, which I had nothing to do with.       I'm going tomorrow night to a place where a common acquaintance is celebrating her birthday. It's very likely that we will bump into each other there.       We're adults. I don't know if he's going to try and reach out to me just to appear cool in front of everyone. Part of me wants to punch him in the face. The problem is, I never got closure, nor was I able to confront him about what he did to me and others. There's little to talk about between us, some few legal issues left because our business partnership is not dissolved yet, but it's not the right place for that.       I'm still friends with his family, I visit them every once in a while, they're very nice people, and have nothing to do with what happened.      All in all it's taken me a long time to forgive him and try to put the past behind me. That's why part of me doesn't want to avoid him. I don't want to cause a scene, of course. It's a small place and I think people will notice. I don't want to excuse myself from attending either.

20090304235430AAEe5qg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm starting to look handsome... what do I do?	Throughout my whole life, (10 years to be precise), I have never had a girlfriend or been in a romantic relationship, or let alone go on a date. It might be that alot of my acne/pimples are clearing up and I've grown 2 inches taller (i'm 6'2" now) My highschool best friends are noticing it to and especially my wrestling friends who start calling me pretty boy. (my earlier nickname was cheese grater, because everytime I wrestled all the pimples on my face popped >.< )   I've always had been in shape and have a decent body and currently taking mma.   I'm a freshman in college now and every time I bike I get "those looks" from passing women. Do you guys have any idea to help me get into my first romantic relationship, because all the experiences I have with girls so far are blunders.

20090305004248AAiOqZS	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is there any chance of getting my ex boyfriend to come back to me?	Hi   A few weeks ago I jokingly flirted with someone on Facebook then sent him a nasty text message when he didn't answer my call. He came to see to talk thru our problems the next day, then I sulked and was negative and he dumped me. Said it was coz this relationship was too much pressure for him. I miss him so much, we aren't really talking now. He said we could be friends but he didn't reply to my text (I said I was trying to move on and asked him if he was ok) so I just left it. I'm going over tomorrow night to apologise for my selfish immature behaviour. Should I ask him for another chance or just leave it  as an apology?

20090305004519AAOhNZA	Family & Relationships;Friends	A "friend" of mine hasn't come through with her promise?	This girl isn't my real friend, considering I only know her through other people. She offered to be the photographer for my photoshoot so I said ok. When it was all done she said she'd send me the pictures through myspace.      It's been a few months (this happened last year), and STILL no pictures! I asked her about them and she said she's "been busy." No sorry or anything. And now she said my pictures have a virus...and I've only asked about them twice-not in a row, but a month or two apart. She sounded annoyed when I asked the second time.      Do I just sit back and get on my life and hope that she'll come through eventually?

20090305000542AA3J1c7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help a man in love!!?	I am falling in love with a female friend who is already taken by someone.       We met 2 months ago at a New Years Eve party, during which time we had a conversation for over 4 straight hours. I immediately felt the chemistry and have been close friends with her since. One day I asked her on a date, but she rejected me, saying that we can only be friends. Having never felt so strongly and deeply about anyone before, I was confused and upset. It almost felt like our friendship was coming to an end, and that I would never be able to find a woman as exquisite, intelligent, caring as her. However, after a bottle of tequila and a week later, I regained my confidence and we finally started to talk to each other again. Little did I know, the worst had yet to happen.       One day she asked for my help on something, so I agreed to meet her. When I saw her, I felt very tempted to tell her how much I care about her, but I knew it would have been futile. She could simply not reciprocate it at the time. Little by little, we talked about our families, hobbies, and whatever else that came to our mind, until she told me about her current boyfriend. Certainly, there were mixed feelings inside of me. On one hand, I was relieved because I speculated that she rejected me for this exact reason, meaning that anything can still happen after they break up. On the other hand, I was even more upset, mainly because of our excellent chemistry, and the fact that she always turns to me for help. This has led me to believe that her lucky sob boyfriend is a big tool. Now, here I am, weeks later, unable to stop thinking about amazing it would be to hold her hands in public or kiss her. For sure, we have become really close friends, but I badly want us to be a couple. Thanks in advance for reading thus far. Please give me any ideas you have on how I could win her heart.
20090305011805AA6mWTu	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Hey, Y'all.  Just need an opinion on a future move.?	Here's my life in a nutshell.  I have moved every couple of years or so until 2005.  My husband had (HAD) a great job since 2002 and we kept moving closer to work.  3.5 weeks ago he was downsized.      Well, in 2006 we started paying mortgage, not rent.  We bought outright from the owners as we didn't want a 30 year mortgage on the house.  We pay the same amount as we were paying for rent, but on a 10 year note.  I have 7 years left and this house is ours.      I love my house.  It needs some upgrading from the 70s, but it's a sweet 5 bed 3 bath 2 car garage ranch style.  I'm in town, but still have a nice front and back yard that's not too big or too small.  Loads of cabinets and closets as well.      Now, my problem.  My husband was just offered a position in Arizona.  I live in Central Texas.  I don't want to move;    1 away from my house and loose it    2 away from my family    3 someplace I've never been and start all over.      I told him that he needs to go, but he doesn't want to leave me alone.  I told him that in this economy, you have to jump on anything that comes your way (he's 55, by the way-I'm 43).  I told him that if he goes out there and I stay here, we will always have this house as our permanent home.  If he goes, I could rent out two of the bedrooms, I have a meally job as a waitress, and he could send his check here to pay bills.      I know I have it figured out finacially, but not emotionally.  We've all been poor before, so we all know what it takes to survive.  I love my hubby dearly, but I would rather love him from a distance than be together on the streets.      Am I being too pragmatic?  His monetary worth to any company is about 75K, but he wants more to live in two seperate places.  I don't know what the cost of living is in Phoenix, but it's pretty cheap where I live.  All three of our children are grown and gone and having enough financial stress of their own to help us.      Ok, so my questions to you arel   1 should he take the job and move away from me?   2 should I dump the house and move with him?   3 should he keep looking for another job closer to home? (DFW area)      Also, if I take on tenants, how much should I charge?  They would have a bedroom and a bath of their own plus living, dining kitchen use.  I pay $1800 a month just on the house and utilities.  If I did take on tenants, I would only want to ask for a flat rent fee.  We turned off the house phone and only have basic cable and the internet is only in our office that would be off limits to anyone, but both rooms have phone access so if they had a computer, they could access it on their own.      Am I overthinking my future?  Tell me what you think.  My head is spinning with "what if"s.
20090305012118AApVRqJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need a friendsip advice and help?	I have a friend, a girl. She liked to joke with me and I did too. She liked me as a friend and I did too.      But, yesterday, I took a picture of her and her girl friends in the cafeteria. She had a bad pose (opening her mouth) and her friends looked stupid too. I mde a mistake by uploading the picture to Facebook.      The next day, she got upset a little but we still made jokes. But, at lunch, she didn't want to talk to me and when I talked to her, she didn't respond but, her friends did.      I have deleted the picture but, still, she didn't want to talk to me and I hate it when people don't like me (I know it sounds selfish but it makes me depressed).      I have apologized to her but she didn't respond.   What do you think I should do?   By the way, she is a little bit childish.

I know I suffer from depression but I wouldn't dare tell anyone about it .I'm an emotional eater and every time a teacher stresses me out I binge eat to the point where I feel sick and want to puke and living here I eat all the time. This is not the life I wanted for myself . I wanted to learn parkour and be really athletic, learn to play the guitar , get an education (not mug up crap and vomit it on paper) I used to eat really healthy back home to the point where eating even a little processed food used to hurt my stomach now I can't seem to put the junk food down which pretty much is adding to the depression.Please don't get me wrong I have no urge to look like a model .I am or rather was a genetically thin person but with emotional binge eating I've gained 15 pounds and I'm Truly not comfortable with my body . I know I should talk to someone but I dint feel like I have any real friends who would care but would rather be happy to hear that I'm unhappy . My skin now is full of acne and my hair is falling out .I tell myself everyday that today will be different but everyday is the same...I need help ...I cant seem to handle my life anymore...I'm so scared ! PLEASE HELP!
20090305001731AAZ5FwR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband is lazy and its driving me insane. What can I do to get him to paticipate in life?	My husband works part time and very few hours. We have 2 small children and a business to run. He always just sits on the lounge and plays ps3. this is not how I want my kids to grow up. Today I left our house spotless and I took the kids to the park. All I asked him to do was fold his work clothes and a few other things. Do you think he did it? no. I am so sick of it. It has been going on 4 2 years and I have just had it. I have been seeing a therapist and she is suggesting that he come in to the sessions. I hope it helps. I am so sick of being resposible for absolutely everything. He is like a child. Will he grow out of this? We have been together 10 years in July. Is there a possibility he will get better or am I dammend to a life time of this? The only time he does anything is when he is going out motorbike riding or go carting with the guys. I hardly get a look in. I feel so unappreciated.
20090305001328AAOA3Zw	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What's the nastiest thing your in-laws do or have?	My future in-laws are serial smokers. Their home is so foul smelling I can't go inside without my eyes burning and my stomach revolting. I have been in dive bars that had fresher air than their home. Everywhere you look, there are ashtrays overflowing with butts, and the walls are stained a streaky orangey yellow from the nicotine. The last few times we've gone by their house, I stayed in the truck under the excuse that my asthma was acting up and I couldn't handle the smoke. Sadly that won't work every time.      What's the nastiest thing your in-laws do or have that makes you cringe to be around them?
20090305011732AArbUtY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My Who-be-husband Deceive My And My Family?	Please I need good advise from Yahoo! Answers.      I met my boyfriend in my granny's house on Dec. 25th 2006 and since then we are great lovers. He didn't told me that he had a wife earlier and a son which I later learned from his kid sister in 2007; I confronted him and he told me that he forget to tell me because they are not together again. He told me that he is working on divorce with her and immediately he divorce her, he will marry me. Last year June, he proposed to me to marry him but I told him that he had to divorce his first wife and he will also marry me legally which he agreed. I believe him because his ex-wife is not living with him but his son is staying with her and I have the key to his house that I went there whenever I feel and I never met his wife there. I had knew almost all his family, he also knew mine and he went home to my village to do new year with me and my people and we did a little family introduction there. It was after this that I learn from an outsider that another woman is having his baby girl which I asked him and he said that was when he was still at teenage years.      Yesterday I was coming back home from my office when I saw his junior brother and he told me that he want to go and meet my boyfriend, I said I also want to see him and we should both go together. We met my boyfriend on the road and he told me that I should go home that he is coming to meet me home now that they want to have a meeting with his mother. I agreed and left and told him not to keep me waiting long for him. As I was going home, I met his senior sister coming out from an hospital which is nearby my house with a new baby at her back, I greeted her and ask that where does she see baby (since she is not pregnant) she laugh and make to go but then turn back and she asked me that didn't my boyfriend told me that his wife just delivery a baby girl this afternoon (the girl he told me he was divorcing). I was shocked and short of word. I told her no and left.      This guy has not only hurt my and my emotion but my entire family also. I have not see him since then and he didn't also call me. Please I need advice, what should I do?

20090305001618AAb5XQ7	Family & Relationships;Family	Looking for any advice/opinions...please?	Note: this is a repost, i'm just looking for help in any shape or form.      So heres the situation.. A lot of it started over this summer, in july, my grandma passed away. She was like the glue of our family, held us all together, she was my mother figure, she raised me.      Well she had been sick for a very long time, so everyone saw it coming. At the time it happened, it seemed like we would all get through this together as a family, but things didn't work out like that. At first we tried to keep things going as a family, but things so stupid as money got in the way.      My grandpa, the greatest man i know, recently started seeing someone else and getting serious right away in October. She is a great woman though, very cultural, very nice, and most importantly she gave my grandpa life again. I seen him after my grandma passed away, he was so lifeless, so sick, like he was heading right there with her. Now he looks and feels alive again.      My mom, and her 2 brothers, my uncles, have so much anger though, they're still grieving i understand that so am i. They say so many mean things to him and his now fiancee, how could they be so mean? After everything my grandpa has done for them, my 2 uncles mainly, they are potheads, they can't keep a job, always lived off of my grandpa. He was always there for them even though they treat him horribly now, if they needed 20$ here, he gave it to them. Most of all when they went to the hospital which is 2 hours away from our home, he payed for their gas/food/hotels. My grandma was the same way with them, they always took care of them even as adults. Now they say mean things about him, act like they can't trust him. My mom isn't "as" bad, but she is still just as mean, she is more independent when it comes to money, but when it came to babysitting my grandma and grandpa always watched my 2 little sisters, and me when i was younger, just so she can go out and get drunk, they were all raised better than that. Now all they do is say stupid things like calling her a gold digger, saying she is living off of grandma's money, and she can't stand anything that was grandma's and hate all the grandkids. All of that is so untrue, if she couldn't stand grandkids why did she welcome me to live with her and grandpa and be a part of their life. She talks so openly about my grandma with me and my grandpa. She respects her so much.      I have lived with my grandpa and grandma much of my life, and currently live with my grandpa once again, and his fiancee, and now i hear things that make me sad about it. When i lived with my mother, things were horrible, all we did was argue, i was so depressed i didn't even go to school. Now that im living with my grandpa and his fiancee, who i am close to calling grandma, i am back in school, also feel alive again, i get all A's and B's in school and have a future for the first time i feel so good. Yet, my mom tells me i'm back to "living off of my grandpa." Why would she say that i am only 15 years old. She says i am being brainwashed and getting an attitude, only because i am finally speaking my mind and telling her what i don't like about her. I love my mom dearly, but she hurts me so much. Even as a kid, she never showed affection for me, and we never talked much.      Why are they being so mean to my grandpa? why do they hate him so much right now and don't want to get over their stupid anger towards him. My grandpa has been through enough why the **** do they think he deserves not only his own pain, but theirs too. He will never forget grandma and tells me that often, he tells me that him and my grandma talked about this long before she was even sick, when my mom was small even, they talked about if anything ever happened to either of them, just to move on, and live life. He loved my grandma, he loved her for almost 40 years (and they were both only in their mid 50's when she died.) So why do my mom and uncles not want him to be happy?      I hate this so much i want everything to be ok it makes me so sad when i think about it. I know i'm going to do well in school and in life, i promised my grandma that right before she passed away and i live by that promise. It murdered me inside to see her take her last breath, and now my mom and uncles think i didn't care as much as i should have. Just because i moved forward in life just like she wanted me to means i didn't care? what is going on in their minds please help me.      I apologize for the long long question, and thank you all so much who read it all. I deeply appreciate any answers and advice, thank you

20090305003248AAMT98p	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Once a cheater...always a cheater?	Over a year ago, I became good friends with a man whom started working at my workplace. He was a married man of 20 years with a child. A very family oriented man, that never went anywhere without them. Over time, he and I developed a close friendship and became wonderful friends. I also during this year became friends with his wife, but I noticed myself leaning more towards him because I knew him more due to work...so my contact with him was a bit more than with her. It didn't take us long to see that we were headed down a destructive path because we both were having very strong feelings..moreso than just friends. We never made physical contact, but did cross the line many times online and on the phone..but kept that seperate from our daytime friendship. So now...almost a year later...we are both acknowledging that we are indeed in love..but do not want to jump head first into anything. He is in the process of divorce now, and she is unknowing that I am the reason why. I feel horrible, but I do see that I must seperate my feelings from hers...as they are two different things..yet connected to one person. I know that he makes me happy, as I do him. Now my own issue lies here....although we have never physically laid a hand on one another...he cheated in many forms. He fought it for the longest time, and we even ended our friendship once to spare things. But we ended up at the same spot. He felt horrible the entire time, but yet soo happy because of me. Does it always hold true that you will lose them the same way you found them???
20090305004520AAEbYjS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my ex has feelings for me? please help?	My ex and i broke up year ago. We still in contact and had been intimate sometimes. Thing is she knows i want her back and i love her but she doesn't want to get back. now when ever i stop answering her phone she starts to call me like crazy. say me things like she miss me and iam a great guy .i know that she doesn't want out of her life .    Also she asks who iam seeing, if i go to dinner is it a guy or girl. if i meet a friend she will ask who is she and how i met her      today I called her up and told that i no longer want to have contact with her. i want someone who loves me and appreciate me. she was saying she respect that and she won't call me. then she shedding some tears and saying she will miss me. Started hugging me   then she asked me if she can still call me and just stay normal friends.She was really sad and trying if i could let her talk to me. telling me how her granny always ask her about me .       so now what u think is going on in her mind. why was she like that does she still have very strong feelings for me .      I asked her twice recently if she wanna get back she said nothing will happen between us      Also before going i asked her if i can get one last kiss. she kissed me even when she was saying it be awkward

20090305002611AAoXyQM	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why is this ok? Favortism?	my bf and I are staying at his parents home. He has been paying rent to let me stay there. it is NOT our ideal place, but he has been in and out of jobs. When I met him I got him to move out with me. We were fine until the company he was with went under. We had to move to his parents. THEN we had an unexpected payment we had to make, and so we will be here for another month or two.... I feel bad, but am taking classes here, and the only other option is to move 6 hours away to my parents home. I AM HATING THIS BTW!!!!   We trya nd be quiet, not to eat their food, and I ALWAYS do the dishes, and laundry ocasionally non of which is ASKED of them. I just do it because I am greatful) I get along well with the mother, but the father is  mean. I stay out of his way.    the bother lives here, and this is where the  problem is.    the brother is a JERK, he is mean to his dog (locks him up) and mean to my bf. PUNCHED my bf because HE grabbed my bf's food. Took MY dog out of our room with strangers in the house, and pees ALL OVER the bathroom.   we (bf and I) are not alloud to talk to him about ANYTHING, my bf gets into trouble when the brother punches HIM, and starts a fight, We get yelled at when we acdently have the t.v up 3 rooms away, when we do not know the dad is sleeping (we watch HGTV nothing loud!) and the brother NEVER gets yelled at, the mother takes care of his dog, his dog barks ALL NIGHT and his t.v is ALWAYS loud, and music which makes his dog bark, and now he is getting another dog when his mother said "no" and he is not getting yelled at.   The father also yelled at my bf for WEEKS about missing a belt, which I found in the garage under HIS clothing...   WHY are we "not aloud" to stand up for our selves, if he yells at us, or punches us WE get into trouble, and when he pees every where, or is loud WE get into trouble! (he cloggs the toilet with paper) we have made an idea that we just ask the mother EVERY TIME it is gross because we are not "aloud" to speak to him.... WTF??? the bother is 24, and a middle brother....   HELP!!!   any ideas?
20090305001700AABRaHf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Are you happier after you get married?	This question is primarily directed to those who are married!      The reason I ask is because, though I'm not yet married, many of the "big events" I've experienced in my life (graduating from college being the most recent) have not really made me "more happy" than I was before.      I guess I'm wondering if you really are happier after getting married, or if the initial state of happiness kind of "wears off" and you return to your previous general level of happiness.
20090305012908AAFyerX	Family & Relationships;Weddings	HELP ! I want to be happy but 3 weeks before the wedding IM SCARED....?	I love my FH, thats not the concern.thing is  I have run out of money......I still need to get my hair sorted, flowers for the bridesmaids and clothes for the honeymoon,not a lot just maybe a couple of tops and a new pair of jeans........My FH has so many responsibilites regarding the wedding etc so I really want to find out a way of doing it myself.........
20090305011756AAs6mSE	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I deal with my sister, calm down and stop being so angry?	She is really difficult to speak to. She was going to be my bridesmaid, then started making all these decisions and getting hurt when I didn't want what she had decided. Then she wanted to come round on my daughter's birthday but we'd already made plans, so we put her off, so she had a total fit on the phone, and told me I could stuff my wedding because she and her family wouldn't be there.   I didn't help because after she sent a couple of texts trying to brush it all off I phoned her and told her in no uncertain terms that she was being selfish and manipulative (and I swore a lot)   Tried to make it up but she sent a note saying I obviously didn't love and respect her and she would come to the wedding but not be bridesmaid.   I e-mailed her asking why she was causing all of this just on the back of me not wanting her round for her niece's' birthday asking her to stop being so stupid, and stop making everyone so unhappy.   Then I phoned her because it all seemed so stupid whereupon she claimed I needed help from the doctor, that she wasn't going to enter into any conversation where I was blaming her for things (then she let rip into me) and she was not responsible for how i was feeling.   I can't deal with her. She's denying she said half the things she did even though she knows my fiancee and her niece were in the room and know what she said, and she's driving me nuts. I'm so angry I can't sleep and as usual, she has everything revolving round her. I need a solution that will help my own anger and helpless feelings, and a strategy to cope with her manipulations.

20090305014528AAxqW0g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	URGH! Why is it like this? :(?	I have two major love problems.            PROBLEM 1      I can get many guys I don't 'have feelings for' to like me,   but I cannot the person I like to like me as much as those other guys do!            PROBLEM 2      I've noticed that I have been in an annoying pattern for the last several years. Wait, make that 6 years.         For example:      I like person1 while person2 likes me.   When person2 stops liking me, I start liking person2.   While I am liking person2, someone else (person3) likes me.   When person3 stops liking me, I start person3.   While I am liking person3, someone else (person4) likes me.   And so on. You get the picture.            Why are my problems there? How do I solve these problems?      PLEASE answer and THANKYOU SOOO MUCH in advance!         xxxxxx

I've never been the type of girl that wanted to leave her friends in the dust when a man comes around. So for the past year and a half--I've been dating this guy. He's always been great to me, and I've always put my friends before him. But now, things are getting more serious. and I find myself spending more time with him than my friends.

20090305014144AA2iPLn	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I really need some help with this.  What can I do for her?	A little background:  I am living with my ex-girlfriend, and we have a child together.  She left me a couple months back, but I still love her and my child more than anything in the world.  About a week or two after she left me she got a new boyfriend.  It has now been almost three months.      Now the question:      She has had a really bad yeast infection along with some other things.  I brought up that she might have herpes.  With this in mind she called her new boyfriend.  We have now come to find out that he has herpes and "forgot to tell her about it".  Now she is extremely worried she might have it, and afraid of what that might mean.  I don't know what I can do for her to help her aside from going with her for the tests.  Can anyone give me some advise on what I can do?  I still love her with all my heart and it tears me apart to see her go through this.  I have a feeling she might stay with her boyfriend to after this, and so I want to help her in a way that doesn't make her feel like I'm trying to break them up.
20090305013745AA3pDcJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	She bit me,lol. now im even more confused. help!?!?	ok so i really like this girl. shes almost 18, im 19 and we work together.   i've been crushing on her for a while now and kinda tried to put it out there that i like her...without saying i do. shes probably the most confusing girl i've come to like...and i kinda like that.lol. anyway, i wasnt sure if she liked me or not so this other girl i work with kinda talked to her about me...and this is what i was told   1)shes got a boyfriend   2)she likes this kid we work with(stupid guy, stoner and drinker)   3)she told somebody to tell me that i didnt have a chance      so i hear that...im kinda bumbed. but i wanted to hear it from her to be 100% sure...so i asked her about it and told her no matter what i wouldn't be mad, that i just wanted to know.   and this was her response   "i don't have a boyfriend but its not that i don't like you i just am not really looking for a relationship right now! i really like you as a friend and an individual and im not saying you don't have a chance i just would rather have us be good friends! and im really sorry if that makes you mad :( "      i assured her that i was not mad, because hey thats better than i was led to believe.      now the confusing part:   after that conversation..we were at work and shes flirting with me again..and a little bit more too. at one point she slapped my ***.lol.   well so now im confused..because she said she would just rather be friends...yet shes flirting with me a little more every now and again...and a little but more intense at times. and then tonight at work..we were standing up at the host stand and i was talking to somebody...and she bit me on the shoulder.lol. i dont know of any girls who will playfully bite a guy except for when they like that guy...so idk.   any ideas on what i should be thinking or doing or whatever...would be greatly appreciated.lol
20090305005417AAS8Jyz	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should i do- stay or move on?	last year i went out with this really popular guy from my school. it lasted two months and then we broke up. while we were dating, he would constantly tease my friends behind their backs when i repeatedly told him to stop it. after we broke up, he started to become quite close with my best friend (just friends nothing more) -the one he used to tease the most. lately though, he has become an absolute pig and has taking to hanging out with us at lunchtime. He pays out me and my other friends and i still have to tell him to stop it (he doesn't). Im so fed up with putting up with him, especially when my friend joins in, but my best friend loves him like a brother and wont hear a word against him..   Should i find new friends or just stay and hope they will stop it?
20090305013917AASwa1m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should you stay in contact with your ex's?	i dont think its a good idea out of respect for the next person you date or marry
20090305003107AAqo2Tf	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	HOW TO HELP HER? Need a serious answer!?	OK i asked this before but only got a "Get outta there now" response, i really need some advice.      Shes been engaged 2 times in 6 months, first guy was an online relationship of a few days. Now she said shes pregnant, has 3 stalkers, her fiances mother wants to kill her, and now she said shes been raped. We tell her to call the cops about it all in general but she says they don't listen. This is why i think it's not serious rather than telling people confidentially she is posting this all over her facebook and we think that the police wouldn't ignore something like this. The rape thing only came out 2 days ago, though she says he was an old fling and is now in love with her. I'm really starting to lose trust with her, i don't want to seem like a bad friend but her life is seeming like a soap opera. She said her mum kicked her out of home, though she had been sneaking her boyfriend in and apparently stealing money off her mum, but 2 weeks ago she was telling us that her mum was going to be in jail. It's gone too far now and he and her new fiance are talking about seriously hurting people. A few of her other friends and i have been talking and think she needs help, like mental help, but we are unsure of how to go about doing so, we don't want to get on the wrong side of her and her boyfriend, at the moment it seems everyone who tried to sort something out with her is on their "Hit list". How could we suggest to her that getting some help might be the right thing?
20090305010404AAJztx8	Family & Relationships;Family	Will I ever be free of family problems?	Okay. This is going to sound negative, but realistically my life is predominantly negative (however, i do cherish the "few" positives in my life)      I live with my aunty and her family. Throughout my whole life, ive always been controlled by her. She decides when i can go out. She says im not allowed to get a girlfreind till I get a degree. (im in lawschool studying law, ive got another 3 years left before i graduate) Also, she emphasises all the wrongs ive done. For example, i recently lied to her (only once). She totally ripped me to shreds for it. But overall, im not a bad, evil, malicious character. Ive made so many achievements in life, she like forgets them. Her behaviour is consistent and constant, and i feel like I'm being mistreated. I know she treats me differently from her own children. Recently, she has threatened to kick me out of the house because she caught me hanging out with a girl mate (not a girlfriend but a girl mate, our friendship was platonic)        Im a very highly intelligent person and i have vision of my direction in life. Im an "A" student and i posses such a strong and determined character. I so strongly visualise myself being financially independent and wealthy. I have got plans and strategies to achieve that, and i strongly beleive i can achieve it.       However, i feel like I'm always gonna be controlled by my aunty throughout my whole life and i won;t be able to live life to how i want it to be.       However, my aunty has given me opportunity to succed and she has sacrificed alot for me to be in the position i am today. So im stuck in a life crisis crossroad. and im so young.       Does anyone have any advice? or can anyone relate? Is this part of life?       :(       Im just hoping it is just a phase in life i go through and eventually will overcome it and in the process i would have accumulated experience for my character.
20090305004437AAFDs2n	Family & Relationships;Friends	Advice on whether i should or shouldn't?	I have a very good friend who yesterday lost her brother [circumstances unknown, found dead in bed]. she was not close to her brother, he abused her and her sister as a child. it is well known amongst the family. My dilemma is minute in comparison, yesterday when she tried to contact me i was out all day, i left my mobile in the house, it was uncharged.[i don't get stressed without my phone, so i am very casual to the annoyance of my friend and family]....of course because she could not contact me she tried the house. i was out, picked the little one up from school and went back out till 5ish when we returned. i put my phone on charge and got the message from my friend about her brother later in the evening. she is very annoyed with me, plus upset of course. the problem is this, i spoke to her, explained to her, but  she has taken the huff with me, i am getting her a card today but should i buy her a gift of flowers or something to say sorry. it was not intentional, i am just inconsistant with my mobile.....my husband said just leave her she is upset and you are getting the backlash, and that he was a scumbag anyway so why is she so upset , but i can't help feeling guilty, is it because she has made me feel guilty?       any advice, any wise people out there who could tell me if i should or shouldnt leave it as it is and just call to talk to her. gift or no gift?   thank you so much, and sorry this is so long! x

20090305005048AA9tZgM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want to get closer to this shy girl, but I'm not sure how?	I'm a freshman in college.  When I started I met the most amazing girl in my art class, but she was really introverted.  We started talking more, but she had trouble holding a conversation.  When we did get talking though, I found her to be the most fascinating person.  She isn't social and doesn't have a lot of friends but since I used to be kind of like that, I felt I could relate.  In the end we actually did spend quite a bit of time with each other and actually spent new years together.  The problem is now about a half a year later, she is still just as shy when we talk, and now I'M running out of things to say.  I've been in plenty of relationships, and I know this girl is really special.  I'm also not sure how she feels about me since she is IMPOSSIBLE to read.  I know she like me, but I'm not sure how.  I would like to ask her out in the future.  Does anyone know how to get this girl talking!

20090305004522AA1PApi	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need help PLEASE! (LONG)?	People, i need a honest answer. There is this girl at school. She liked me and told me about it. I didnt know about her much but i started to like her. She is perfect, a 4.5 average, exceptionally attractive and all around awesome. She told me this about 4 months ago. However, we both never really came to a onclusion. So we ended up just being friends. Recently, she asked me if i wanted to go with her to a school dance. I think its some hawkins dance. I was suprised since whenever i saw her i always tended to avoid or walk another way. But i accepted going with her and so we are set. I tried buying her a ticket but the school said no since they wanted her present. I insisted but she said it was okay. I recently heard from my friends since they all volunteer at the hospital the other day that they were talking about me. When i came up in the topic they told me that she was making really good comments about me and how she should have never not like me. I sent a text and she felt so happy about and she later texted me on some physics hw. Normally, she never talks to me but she just recently started to get close again. I still like her so mcuh but I stood away in respect of her decision. Anyways, does this mean that she like me or is this just one of those get this thing done and over with things? Please answer as much as possible!

We were happy and he was so nice to me.   Today we suppose to meet up at 6pm. And he also said later is 630pm. It was 30 minutes before 6pm when I notified him I will be late. He replied to me that not later than 630. I told him I will be meeting him before 7pm and apologized.   When I arrived at 7pm, he wasnt in that meeting place - On my apartment which he have a key duplicate. Called him 5 times but he turned off his phone. I sent him text message asking him where he is at. Sent him more text message asked him if we will still on with our dinner date, no response.   After several calls but no answer, he finally replied and said he went back home and he doesnt really wanna talk.    What pissed me off is I expected a lot, I was busy before date and sacrifice just for that date. He didnt tell me earlier that he was on his way home and cancelled date. We dont really see that often coz of hes work, he travelled a lot thats why Im eager to see him.   I coudnt stop sending him text msg that I told him Im upset and explained my side but he wont listen. Last year I caught him talking to girls but it wasnt a problem at all.   Im disappointed so I said something that might offended him.    So he text me back that Im a stupid if i get mad at him. And he said FY word to me, he said Im a ****. That hes tired the way I treated him.    I was surprised when he said that to me, its very unreasonable for him to get mad to wait 30 minutes compared to go back to his place driving an hour.   Now its hurting me a lot. Honestly I dont wana let him go. He even refused to talk to me tomorrow that maybe we will be feeling better.   What should I do? Is he breaking up with me?   I attempted to break up with him many times before because I dont wanna ended up this way. I mean were so happy but he travelled more than we see each other so its hard. But I trusted him and we lasted til now.   Also I dont believe that he was mad at me of the things I said to him, he knows I really dont get mad and dont say bad wordss. I dont even considered a bad words coz I thought it will hurt him. I asked him if there another reason why was he acting very short tempered and impatient.   Help!!

(married couple,pls.answer)?	how would you feel or react if husband is asking your opinion on the meaning of girl staring at a man? i asked him why he's asking? he said that because there's a new girl in their office who keeps on looking at him. I told him maybe he just looks familiar w/ her & no malice. I felt bad when he said that infairness she's young & beautiful. Tomorrow is our anniversary, and that makes me feel unexcited to celebrate.

20090305010557AAGiyJm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Past history with men...?	So i'm dating this guy who's very inexperienced with women sexually. We are totally connecting and we llike each other a lot. The problem is, I feel like I'm on this pedestal and I'll get right off once he finds out about my sexual history with guys (which im not proud of), if you get my gist. However, I've changed and I don't do any of that crap anymore... would this negatively affect things?
20090305010854AAHwieI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This hot shy girl is hard to read. did she reject me?	i've been going to my college's chemistry library for the last couple months to study and borrow laptops, and, most importantly, because i like the girl who works there. we've chatted a few times, but nothign more than 'hows your day been?'. she's really cute but seems quiet and not very expressive/outgoing   so yesterday, well i managed to ask her how her weekend went and got her name   the fact that she even smiles when she sees me and talks to me and even reciprocates when i ask her questions could mean that at least she doesnt find me hideous   today, I asked her out. ok so heres how it went   after i got the laptop and asked her hows it going, she responded, and then she asked me back. i then stumbled for a few seconds, with my head down, stuttering, then i told her that i wanted to get to know her better and asked if she wanted to get some coffee some time. she looked kinda confused after previously smiling. i then asked how about this weekend? and she responded right away that shes busy since her friend is visiting from out of town (i dont think she was lying since she responded right away). i then asked about any time this week, and she said shes busy, there was a pause for about a second or two, and then she said that she will get back to me   i then said 'how about i get your number?', she then gave it to me. she smiled. then i left with the laptop   there may have been people standing right next to us and watching the whole thing      finals are in 2 weeks from now, so i dont know how we can possibly meet up for coffee even if she agrees, since shes busy this weekend, and this week, if shes being honest. maybe we can meet up 4 weeks from now, in the new semester?      so if she does agree to go with me for coffee if i ask her out in the next 2-3 days, is she likely to flake on me anyways? similar thing to happened to me about a month ago, where the girl flaked on me

20090305012012AADRLnE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Unsure about leaving behind 4 year relationship?	Okay, so I've been off and on with this guy for 4 years. We didnt become "intimate" till this past year. He was my first, having sex I feel may have left me less attached and I feel as if he became more attached. He wanted to hang out practically every night after that. I go to college full time and I had 2 jobs. On top of that I am a very socialable person and have a great handful of friends. Well I started giving excuses as to why I couldnt hang out, all were truthful but we ended up not hanging out for a month. I believe during that time he started hanging with a girl he had a thing with before me. He spent Valentines day with her instead of me. That was the only day I had free that week, I didnt even care that it was valentines day but we got into a fight the night before and he told me he had to work. We "broke up" about 3 times that following week, but then I quit my one job and now have all this free time. We hung out one night, did have sex and then the next day I see on facebook that he's in a relationship with her. He still asked me to hang out a couple of times but I said no just b/c I was unsure of the situation until a week later, he texted me asking me how many guys i've been with. I said just him and he told me that he doesnt want to cheat on her. But he feels like he maybe would, only with me. I told him that he should probably try not to cheat on her and i told him he can talk to me anytime he wants and i told him to take care. It's just it doesnt feel real, we've been "unofficially" together for 4 years and even with all the off and ons i knew he was always there. And I stopped spending time with him for a month and he gets a girlfriend. Also another thing is I didnt want to be in an official relationship at the time. We had all the perks of a normal boyfriend girlfriend relationship, we just didnt have the titles. I didnt realize how much i liked him till he got into a relationship. He'd always agrue with me about how he wanted to be my first option but I always ignored that and thought my jobs, school, family, and friends should come first. And I know now if I would interrupt his newly found relationship he'd give it up to be with me but I am a very kind person and i know this other girl likes him and i know he does like her too. I'm trying to get over this, for him. But it's honestly the hardest thing I've ever done. I want to pick up my phone and text him when I'm drunk. I want to call him when I'm lonely, when I see he's online I want to im him/ facebook chat with him. We tried being done so many times, but we always ran back to eachother. Another person is involved now and I dont know if i feel right running back this time.   I just dont know what to do?   The last week I've tried hanging with other guys that are interested in me but it made me realize I just want the guy I've been with. I dont feel attracted to these other guys and it might just be b/c I'm not over him or maybe it's b/c he was my first and I'm not sure if I feel right moving on THAT much just yet,   Any advice/ thoughts?

20090305013219AAFQ7cx	Family & Relationships;Family	Hi, I signed up with Yahoo JUST to ask this (LONG) question. I'd appreciate any constructive input :)?	I asked my friend to ask it for me since she has a Y!A account, but she doesn't want to (and I quote), "make [her]self look bad". Well, when I explain the question, you'll see that I deserve that from her (it's tough love all the way around with her, anyway, lol).      SO... on to the question... (no, wait, I have to appeal to all of you first to PLEASE don't judge me, I just need some constructive advice and help from people who've been in similar situations or people who just want to lend a helping hand).      Yea, so NOW, on to the question...      I've been a relationship for over 4 years now. I love my fiancee dearly, he means everything to me. We're best friends, we do everything together. Both he and I have been faithful all throughout our relationship and we deeply love each other.   When I was introduced to his family 4 years ago, I met his wonderful brother and wife, and their 2 beautiful, sweet little children. I mean, they are the BEST (soon-to-be) in-laws you could ask for!      Now, I've always loved my fiancee's brother (but, of course, in a very platonic way). He is such a great guy and him and my fiancee are the closest, most loving brothers you will ever meet. They'll do anything for each other.   My fiancee's brother loves me, too (yes, in a platonic way, as well). He's NOT one who's very expressive emotionally, so the ONE time he told me, "I love you, too", I had to look up and see if pigs were flying. His usual response to me when I leave their house and say, "I love you!!" is, "Yea yea, I don't love ya... whatever..." or something like that because he's so reserved and gets embarrassed with showing his feelings.      But all jokes aside, something happened this past weekend that I just can't understand. My fiancee and I were out and we had some car trouble and some other things went wrong and it was FREEZING outside - it was just a pure mess. He called his brother and he dropped everything he was doing and came to help us. He took care of us like if we were babies, I mean I felt so much love from him towards us.   Since then, I've been thinking of his sweetness and kindness and generosity (which he's always had) in a different way. THIS IS WHERE I NEED YOUR HELP, PEOPLE! .... Because a few days later, I was fantasizing about him. I feel this strong urge to kiss him and sometimes (this is really bad) even ... sleep with him... I am so ashamed and embarrassed...   I never looked at him in this way (even though he's extremely good looking and has the personality to go with it) because he isn't the one I fell in love with. I just never saw him in any other light than a super great, loving brother-in-law-to-be.   The kind of feelings I have for my fiancee, I WILL NEVER share those feelings with anyone else, first and foremost. Ok, seriously, I REALLY love my fiancee and I WILL NEVER HURT HIM. He is my everything.   But, I don't know how to get these thoughts about his brother away from my head. I need help, I think I am mentally cheating. I can't do this to my fiancee, he is my other half, my significant other, my baby... I love him.      Please tell me, am I doing something wrong by thinking about him in ways that I shouldn't?      Or, is this normal for people and something not to be worried about?      Or, maybe I should just "get it out" and go over to him and kiss him? That's not something I would normally ever even think of!! OMG, do you see how this thing has me confused??      PLEASE, ANY & EVERYONE, I need your help! How can I go back to my normal thinking - that I love my fiancee's brother in a platonic way and there's NOTHING sexual about it - How do I just get my thoughts back to the way they were.      I truly, from the bottom of my heart, appreciate all your responses. And I genuinely apologize for the length of this question.      Thanks,   white.
20090305013753AAMFGw6	Family & Relationships;Family	Did you parents consider aborting you at any stage? How does this effect you if at all?	N/A
20090305013858AAd73VR	Family & Relationships;Family	PLEASE READ MY STORY!?	Thank you so much for complying! Don't go! Please read this...      I  am a 20 yr old male and I am gay. Lost interest already? I understand, who can blame you...   This is the first time I am admitting this to myself. After all those years of hiding it. Hiding who I really am. I am finally stating the truth. I have suppressed this part of me for as long as thirteen years. Yes, that's right, since the age of seven. How did I know then? I remembered feeling attracted to some of the other boys my age. Not surprisingly, these feelings heightened drastically during puberty. But despite these obvious feelings I was not willing to submit myself to them. I was not ready to be alienated from my homophobic family and friends. Instead, I lived a lie. Telling myself and others that the right girl would soon show up. Have you ever considered how many other teens go through this? Do you know the implications of failing to accept who you are, and living to gain the approval of others. Personally, it is a very destructive process that has left me contemplating suicide many times. I hate this part of myself everyday. It rips my heart and lowers my self worth. I know I am blessed to have people who "love" me. The "me" who they see. The mature, humble and *heterosexual young man. But it's hard to fathom how they would react if they knew I was gay. After asking me so many times "Have you found a girlfriend yet?" and telling me implicitly how much they loathe gays and lesbians. It kills me. Why do people hate homosexuals so much? I really can't explain why I am this way,  just as how you can't explain why you are heterosexual. No matter how hard I have tried I cannot find girls sexually attractive. I cannot just be straight at will. I wish I could explain why I am gay but I can't. Why do we torture those who are different? Even when they themselves are already hurting and wish they could change. In spite of all my abnormalities, I am grateful that I am studying at a reputable college and have accomplished much. However, I am tired of living a lie. I just want to be the real me, and still be respected. I want to be sincerely happy and not just acting the part. I want family and friends who love the real me. That is why I am planning to let them all know the truth. It is either coming out or being trapped until I die. I admire so much all the open gays, bis and lesbians out there. Having the courage to be themselves albeit not being accepted by society. The strength of their mentalities astounds me. For I can see how hard it is to be different and being typecasts for it.    As a message to all the present and future parents out there, you may never know if your child is gay. In my parents case, they have a gay son who is masculine, humble and mature and yet they do not know what he has to go through internally each day. They say and show that they love him, yet they bash the unseen that lies within him. I know that heterosexuality is the norm, but that does not mean homosexuality does not exist. Being a homosexual is not a choice. However, it is living this lifestyle that is a choice to be made. Even though I plan to come out, it does not mean that I am going to forget who I am and just start sleeping with other guys. It signifies that I am ready to be honest with who I am and am putting an end to a destructive secret. I just want to live life honestly and happily.      Thank you so much for reading. Just wanted to share my story. Feel free to voice your opinions whether negative or positive via this post or e-mail.

We are 16, and have been best friends since middle school. Shes pretty and ditzy, while I have decent looks (no one is perfect:), chopped hair, not preppy at all, etc. and she has a million "cool" friends. Well, recently, I have been going to parties with her friends, and they really like me. But shes furious. "Stop talking to them! Leave my friends alone!" Shes pissing me off. Am I not allowed to hangout with them, just because im a bit nerdy? Besides, I have better weed than most of her friends. Plus, its making me money (selling my weed to her friends). Their rich, and a bit preppy, but we have good times. But shes so mad. What should I do? I dont understand

20090305014527AA7qjRp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So I REALLY like this guy I see all the time at the gym, but I'm just too shy to say anything to him?	Ok lets get this straight. I'm 16 years old turning 17 in 2 months, and I love going to the gym. I've been going for years, I love being in the best shape as possible. I usually go alone though. There is a new gym that opened about 4 months ago, its like a rec center one that most students go to from high schools. I've been going ever since because its close to my house. Ever since I've gone, there is this boy who I always see there. Ever since the first day, I just couldn't beleive what I saw. I've never seen anyone like him before, its like my whole heart just dissolved and that was the only person I can picture or think about. In the very beginning I remember him looking at me and smiled, an I totally just turned bright red.      In the beginning he was in great shape, but not like huge...probably around 150ish ripped. I'm a very shy person, I've always been like that. I always sort of watch him from a distance, but when he looks I turn to something else. After a month of seeing him, I found out he's shy too..I can tell. I've caught him looking at me too, and when we are using a machine close to eachother, I will see him kind of go do something else away from that area, but at the same time I get sort of stiff too and freeze up. Then another time, which was very awkward; we both ended up doing abs at the same time on the ground area, and we were like RIGHT beside eachother. I felt SO awkward but I wanted to say something so bad but I just couldn't!!      And what I also found, was that I usually always go at around 7pm. Thats when he's there too. A few times I go earliar at like 6pm and leave at 7, and then I see him walk into the gym just when I'm leaving...Then the next day I go at the same time (6) and he will be there at 6 too when he normally goes at 7. I tested him and I went again at 6 just on purpose.      I don't know which high school he goes to, but there are quite a few in our area that are close together. I know he's probably a little younger than me, I can just tell. But also what I'm sort of concerned now is that, he's gotten REAL big in the last month. He is probably like 185-190lbs at the same height(around 5'8) and it seems like he gained like 15 pounds of mass within a month. I also noticed he has a little acne on his back. I'm so worried if he is dabbling with steroids!      What can I do, to overcome this? I want to talk to him...I'm just extremely shy. Is he thinking the same as what I'm thinking?? He's completely gorgeous, and I can tell he's a TOTAL sweetheart just by looking at him.       I really need some help! Even though I've never talked to him, I've never liked a boy this much before...

I'm 15 and i have know this girl for 6 weeks and we've become friends. A while ago people kept asking her if she liked me, and she said she kind of did, more than a friend, but maybe not enough? Anyway that was 2 weeks ago. Now we talk a hell of alot in english. I was told that us 2 can really talk by the most talkative person i know. I like this girl i've befriended but lots of people say shes slutty. Shes hot. A while ago we organised for 2 of us two to go to the movies. It never happened. We didn't bother, and she couldn't go on two occasions. Yesterday she asked me if i wanted to go to her house sometime to play pool and plasma tv at new house (she has new rumpus room - pool table, plasma). Then she said only if you want too. So what do i do? What does she mean when she asks this? Does she really just want to play pool at her house? Or does she want action? Please help give me some tips

20090305020224AAFA6py	Family & Relationships;Friends	She has said she likes someone more than a friend, now she is saying she loves me, doesnt care for other perso?	Rgiht.   20yrs old, gf 19,   Dating 4months almost 5.      Basically I have paranoid personality disorder, She has stood by me through the 5 months,where I have gone through some ****.      She was distant the previous week,not talking. I found out she thinks I'm jealous of her friendship with my housemates (one she is good friends with, both guys, and new from school, no love/sex interest at all). My paranoia makes me think shes not wanting me, but spends most time with me.      She told me she 'likes more than a friend' (quote) someone I know, and that was what worried her the past week. Now, she is saying she loves me and is really sorry about it all. She told me she knows nothing will happen with this person, but is this apologising just trying to get second best guy?/? If thats so I'm ******* off. But she has really stood by me, and says she loves me, and I;m worried that the liking of someone else, is just becasue I pushed her away a bit with my paranoia. I love her. Aheck of a lot. Shes not my first gf either, so I do undrstand it could be just her trying to get my attention, when I'm going through **** and ignoring her a bit, But she seemed too serious for that.      I wonder if the persn she likes is another housemate, who is a very good friend she has recently been aquainted with, and I know for definate that he would not make a move on her, hes a very good friend of mine and he has shown no interest in her.      Should I jsut step up my game and get over my insecurities in my paranoia,or is the relationship not really worth it if she 'likes' someone else, but is now telling me that she loves me. Me and her have been through a lot int he 5 months, more than previous relatinoships of mine.

20090305021348AAIyvM3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	After 30 years of marriage, in divorce, will a husband have to pay for his wife employment training for a job?	Please help.....all you lawyers in the state of California!      What should a wife expect when she divorce a husband in the state of California.  Will her husband have to pay her alimony, and additionally, can she have him to pay for her to go to school to get some training, in order for her to find employment so that she can support her self.  She have not worked outside of the home in 30 years of the marriage.  She is divorcing because of adultery, after numerous ones throughout the whole marriage.  Though her husband was in the home, I can vouch for her, that she spent all the time raising the children.  All of her children graduated as honor students with academic scholarships, and they were scholar athletes.  This woman is a jewel, and this man treats her like she should worship the ground he walks on, because he keeps a roof over her head, and feed her.  He won’t get the car fixed, while he wine and dines the women he has affairs with.   She’s real smart, and I know he knows it, and he is jealous of her.  He’s a piece of work.        She was just released from the hospital, and is recovering from having bleeding ulcers throughout her intestines from stress.  She have been in and out of the hospital for pneumonia, in the last 5 years. I believe, all because of stress, and all the other cruel evil things her husband has done to her.   I know her husband believes that she cannot, and will not leave him.  I believe it's  because when she leaves, she want to make sure she can make it, because she was mistreated from being placed in a children’s home and foster home while growing up because she was taken out her home by the state as a teenager because of "horrific" physical abuse.  She has said repeatedly that she do not want to ever he homeless again in this life, and she do not want to have to come back to him again.  She said she conscienly raised her children to make it on their own, and compete with the best,  so that they would not have to depend on anyone, or fill inadequate about themselves.  I have dealt with her husband, and he is very manipulative, clever, resourceful, vengeful, very charming, but insidiously evil. He said he was going to retire from his main job, even though he cannot afford to, and he will only receive 85% of retirement pay.  This man is in his early 5O’s.  I’m certain, that he do not want  to give her half of his income, however, he can generate income to match his paying job from his other job that he only files 1099‘s on only if he chooses to. I know it’s to scare her to think that she cannot make it on her own with only half of his retirement pay, in order to make her afraid to leave him.   Any advice will be helpful.        Thanks.

20090305021410AAh9XWz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am i a big joke to him?	The guy who i've liked for 3 years and i have been seeing each other for the past 7 weeks or so. Last time i saw him i asked a lot of questions about him, regrets, goals in life, and past relationships etc, however said that one regret was not getting with a girl he liked in sixth form, that he was hungover her and still chats to her now after having an arguement with her before they left sixth form, but didnt mention or show any signs of still liking her? He also didn't strike me as the "one night stand guy" seeing he is a church boy, but said that he had slept with a girl he ment on holiday but he doesn't regret it!    The thing with him is that you never know what to say or do, he can be shy and then misunderstand what your trying to say, so i have to tred on thin glass. The real question is there any point of trying to pursue a realtionship with him? or am i a big joke to him?

20070105173033AAQoxjs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I just a challenge to him?	Guys what are some reasons as to why you stay friends or "hang-out" with an ex? My ex dumped me a year ago, yet last week he called me and asked me to go see a movie with him. I went with him, he picked me up & after the movie he just took me home. Isn't it odd that after one year, he didn't wanna even have coffee after the movie? On the drive home, when I asked him why he wanted to see me, he said that he wants to see me 'every once in awhile'. BUT, we only dated for one month, so why after one year, after HE dumped me, why does he wanna hang out and see me once in awhile? By the way, we never had sex during our relationship cuz he knew that I wanna save myself for marriage. In fact, it never went past kissing. Is he just keeping me on the side, or does he see me as wifey material? So what does he REALLY want and should I be worried?

But now i really like both of them. They are boht juniors and im a sophmore in highschool. One of them I chat with a lot and one time she jokingly asked me about having sex. Although she was kidding, obviously she thought about it. If I take this path, she will probably be very easy to get. The other one I talk to alot about personal things. She says im the only guy that ever listens to her. I also like chatting with her a lot and have told her sthings that i would prolly not tell anyone. I know my guy friends wont accept my second choice so im kinda reluctant. Last time my friends told me not to go out with someone, they were right cuz that date was really bad and we have this saying..."bros before hos". Thats wat friends are for right, someone to lean on when ur getting screwed over. I have good relationships with my guy friends and dont like to lose their favor. WHich should i pick?

Hi, I met this guy in a class last year and really like him.  However, I am really shy (I was in a really bad relationship about 4 years ago) and do not know how to keep the conversation going.  We used to talk every day in class and then started flirting, but I became a little uncomfortable and kinda closed up. He is really nice and we both wished that we had talked to each other more in class (he graduated in May).  Does anyone have any advice on how I can become more comfortable talking to him and how to take the conversation to another level besides just saying "hi, how are you, how's life, etc".  Should I tell him that I was in a bad relationship?  Would that make it easier to talk to him if he knew that?

Me and my boyfriend have been going out for just over 3 months, and are really close to each other. We are both turning 15 soon. He's kinda shy and also geeky/nerdy about video games. When ever we are cuddling on his couch or are alone, i am pretty sure that i he keeps trying to kiss me. I would love for him to kiss me since he's so shy and all, but this is both of ours first kiss and I'm really nervous about it. I've been doing some reading on the web and have figured out how, but I'm still just really nervous about it. I just turn my head away before he gets to close normally, but I think that if I keep doing this for too long he'll think that i don't like him. What should I do? Isn't there a way to bridge the gap between hugging & cuddling to kissing each other?   please no curses or anything really vulgar on here

20061212133803AAUDuhU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help me!?	I had to go to a company party today and there was this guy there that I used to work with who knows that I (he thinks used to) like him but I discovered when I saw him that I was still attracted to him. Anyways, I was talking to some people and he came up and was all, "Hi ____, how are you?" And I tried to talk to him but no words came out and I just kinda smiled, made a wierd noise and walked away. The look on his face was, "Um, okaaay". I felt stupid so I went to try and talk to him later but as I approached, he turned the other way like he was trying to avoid me and didnt respond until I said his name. Then he talked to me but he was not smiling AT ALL, and the conversation felt awkward.  He was staring me in the eyes the whole time I was talking to him but that could just be because he is confident. My questions are... 1.) Do you think he hates me now? 2.) Do you think he thinks I am dumb? 3.) Did I embarrass him when I walked away 4.) Was it obvious that I still like him? Thank u

20070306172230AA6VY5f	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this normal man behavior after a break up?  Is he covering up his true feelings?	My ex and I broke up almost 4 months ago.  I left him even though I was 4 months pregnant.     Since then, i have only talked to him a few times.  He acts as though he doesnt see me when he is around me.  Has begun seeing other women, actually quite slutty women.  He asked me about my doctor appts once but pretty much just acts like he doesnt care one way or the other and says quite mean things at times to me.   A guy friend who knows him says that guys deal with things differently than women.  That he does care about me and this baby, but is acting like he dont because thats how guys handle things when they are hurting over something.   Just wondered if this is true for some or all guys?      Please dont reply with "move on, u and your baby deserve better stuff".  I know all this.  My focus is on my child right now, but, i just thought i would ask.   Just want honest answers concerning my question please.   Especially from the fellas out there.  Thanks

A year ago I gave a guy my address and phone number in a greeting card after finding out through simple gestures and words that he really likes me very much. But he did not call me at all until recently we suddenly met on the streets and I asked him 'what was all that about, you never called and neither did you give me your number!' He just replied, i did not want to cause any trouble' (twice). By the way he knows my little daughter too and she was not very friendly with him when I first introduced them.      Do you think he is feeling that he does not want to be in the way of a mother-daughter relationship and that is why he has given up any interest to be my boy friend?

We took a break 4 months ago and she was drunk and did **** with another guy. She came back to me and told me she was srry and that she loved me and cried and so on. I took her back. Ever since then i have not been happy with our relationship. I know its because when she did that i lost that feeling you're suppose to have, when you know the other person cares about you. Last night i told her i should have not got back with her that easy, and instead make her work for me because that would have made me feel better. I would have needed her to chase me. I told her i wasn't happy and that i wanted to end it with her. She said she doesn't know what to do. She told me that it wasn't over and that she would do anything as long as we stayed together. She said to give her a chance to let her prove she wants to be with me and show me she cares. I said alright. I really love her and as much as i don't want to end it,

20090305034506AAOGlCe	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it a bad thing that I want to get married at 18?	I've been with my boyfriend for 2+ years now. By the time I'm 18, we'll have been together 3+ years. Is it a bad thing that I want to get married so early? Me and my BF have talked about it and we both decided there isn't a problem, he doesn't mind and I don't mind. We think its a great thing. I asked my mom earlier tonight if she would pay for part of the wedding if I was to get engaged and she's just pretty much told me she wasn't going to because I was so young. I mean, I know 5 couples who got married (including my mom at 19 -has been married since and is now 45) at 18 and they've stayed together 5+ years and 10+ years without any problems, so why is she acting like this? Is it really a bad thing to get married at 18? I mean, I'm out of school and I'm not going to college. So why is it a problem that she doesn't want me to?

20090305030649AA3icOk	Family & Relationships;Family	Family crisis due to my father, please help?	It is now coming up to nearly a year since my Dad decided to sell our family home and swan off to Edinburgh to do a degree. My Mum then selfishly decided to buy a ￡200,000 house, when our other house STILL hasnt sold (I say she is selfish because she didnt want to stay in the old place til it was sold, and she has always gone on to me about never ever getting myself in debt- she has done exactly that). We are basically having to live on the breadline (no joke). I am at college part time, and work shifts as and when needed as a supply nursing assistant. However, shifts are scarse and I havent had much income due to the infrequency of the shifts and have been on Jobseekers for a month. I have applied to different other jobs eg care, but get as far as the interview before they say I have all the qualities, but insufficient experience.      My Dad claims he is in poverty, but I know he is lying. He has a "tenant" staying with him, a woman who is a complete *****; she is so horrid to me, last time I was down, she asked me how much I earnt in my job as a nursing assistant and grimaced when I mentioned the kind of work I do, saying she could never wipe bottoms or clean people (she is some poor mans Trinny and Susannah eg she gets paid to tell people how to dress etc).       Despite this, I have continued to go on, and do well. My driving test is on Saturday, and I want to pass. I have discussed with my Dad that I will pay for my sisters car with the minimal savings I have, and he PROMISED only two years ago, that "whatever your sister gets, you will get too". So she got her car insurance paid for the first year, but now he says he is in "poverty", he wont pay mine. And I am hopefully going to uni this year to do nursing, and again, it was "when you go to uni, we will make sure that your accommodation is paid for". Again, I'm getting the same excuse.      I know he is lying though about his financial situation. At Christmas, my sister and I got very expensive presents which he greedily boasted were "around ￡300 each". He can even afford an accountant, plus gets a big pension. I dont see why my future should be jeopordised due to his lies.       My Mum is refusing to divorce him (first because she really cant afford to), but also because she has secured my Nans house in me and my sisters name, so when she eventually dies, we will inherit the house. Should she divorce him, he is entitled to half, and will get the house.

He asked me on a scale from 1-10 how cute I think he is & I said 8. When I said that he smiled,winked & said thanks.. He's been siting next to me at the lunch table for the past week. I heard him talking to his friend & his friend said r u gonna ask her out today? Matt went idk but I want to.. I have no clue if they were talking about me or not because they were talking loud.

Hi so I am 19 years old. i have never had a boyfriend and not even a kiss yet. its pretty sad, i know. im not overweight or anything...im just really shy and i dont know how people think i look. i dont know. anyways, part of it is that im shy and the other part is i am not even the least bit attracted to guys my age. im attracted to much older guys..usually mid to late thirties. so usually im screwed. i dont have the guts to ask out a much older guy! theyll think im a freak.       anyways...i am really interested in a guy at work...hes like 36. hes not married though...but hes so nice but hes pretty shy and soft spoken. i wanna ask him out.hes so nice with me and really encouraging i love talking to and being around him...but im so scared of rejection...we always say hi and smile but lately we've been talking more..i developed a crush on him like three weeks ago and decided i wanted to make longer conversations but then he did and..i mean im so much younger. i feel older though..im an old soul. anyways..what if i offer him like 400 dollars or something to go out with me? just to have coffee or something. it would make my day. i know this sounds dumb...but if i offer him money then its a good change he wont say no right? i mean i kind of have low self esteem...i dont think anyone will go out with me unless i pay them.  im just saying...i mean everyone can use extra money. so what else could i bribe him with?

My best friend of like 9 years has been married for 1 1/2 years to a man from peru who thinks basically "Men are superior to women". He is mean to her. He has 3 kids by his ex-wife that do not even know about his new wife (My best friend). He is my fiancee's manager and has told my best friend that he has been transferred. This is not true....he asked to be moved that way he could get her away from her friends and family. Basically anyone that would tell her he is a freakin' possessive asshole.

20090305033000AAIUBsa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	I bought this girl a rose for valentines day in school. She said "thanks" and asked me why I gave her one with a smile on her face. She asked me online and I told her I liked her and thought she was the prettiest girl in school. She didn't believe me and said "lol" a few times throughout the online conversation because she thought I thought she was mean, so I gave her proof that two of my friends know that I like her. After math class, which is the only class I have her, she walked out the classroom first and I was behind, she looked back which she rarely does. My friend told me she asked him privately after math class if i liked her to confirm probably, and my friend said yes. So does she like me or at least is interested?

He's very annoying because he constatly pokes me, begs for my screen name (which i wont give to him), etc. I tried ignoring him and i yelled at him a few times to shut up (when i got frustrated), and finally, today i just told him i didn't like him. However, he still bothers me and repeatedly asks me "why am i annoying? how am i annoying? huh? why won't you tell me? how am i annoying? i'll change. just tell me. How am i annoying? c'mon tell me how am i annoying." the thing is i don't want him to change because of me. That would be being someone who you're not. But he won't give up and stop bothering me until i go out with him. To make things worse, I'm in EVERY SINGLE ONE OF HIS CLASSES and my locker is right next to his! What should I do?

I looked at many that said it was free, but when you get almost done they want your credit card number, (I highy recommend anyone not to use their credit card on the puter) I am believing their is no such word as free!!

Okay so I had an x-boyfriend who was my first love and we grew up together and lost our virginity to each other. Eventually he was "seduced" by this girl in high school and cheated on me, totally broke my heart because I felt we were meant to be. We were going out for 3 1/2 years then I moved states and life went on. I went to visit my hometown were he lives and I'm moving back to here soon but we met up and talked, laughed, had fun and did have sex! I spent the night and all everything seemed fine. We are older now 25 and 26 he isn't seeing anybody neither am I. We talk on the phone once in a while and yes I still have crazy feelings for him, I feel so happy and my heart races I feel so connected and in love with him. He laughs on the phone with me and talked about moving in with me being room mates (joking around)/ visiting me "needing to get away "and wanting a baby (paying someone to carry his child without strings attached) or adopting one Should I pursue this or is he just wasting my time and making me believe something special can become of this? How do I know he isn't playing games with my head because he knows I have feelings for him, guys what do you think? BTW I am very attractive, successful and funny is he liking me as a friend only or maybe more?

20090305023359AA0wcIl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Cant read this quiet girl. did she reject me?	i've been going to my college's library for the last couple months to study and borrow laptops, and, because i like the girl who works there, since shes nice and good-looking. we've chatted a few times, but nothign more than 'hows your day been?'. she's really cute but seems quiet and not very expressive/outgoing   so 2 days ago, well i managed to ask her how her weekend went and got her name.   yesterday, I asked her out. ok so heres how it went   after i got the laptop and asked her hows it going, she responded, and then she asked me back. i then stumbled for a few seconds, with my head down, stuttering, then i told her that i wanted to get to know her better and asked if she wanted to get some coffee some time. she looked kinda confused after previously smiling. i then asked how about this weekend? and she responded right away that shes busy since her friend is visiting from out of town. i then asked about any time this week, and she said shes busy, there was a pause for about a second or two, and then she said that she will get back to me   i then said 'how about i get your number?', she then gave it to me. she smiled. then i left with the laptop      finals are in 2 weeks from now, so i dont know how we can possibly meet up for coffee even if she agrees, since shes busy this weekend, and this week, if shes being honest. maybe we can meet up 4 weeks from now, in the new semester?      so if she does agree to go with me for coffee if i ask her out in the next 2-3 days, is she likely to flake on me anyways? similar thing to happened to me about a month ago, where the girl flaked on me      how does my plan sound? i will call  her tomorrow and ask if shes available next week (shes probably busy studying for finals). if she says shes busy, ill ask if she wants to hang out some other time. i will then go to the library and say hi to her next mon or tues, and make small talk, trying to read if she finds me creepy or not. if not, then i will call her again after break and ask if she still wants to hang out. if she says shes busy, then i'll assume she rejected me
20090305033033AAfM23s	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does it matter if i've been with other guys since my first?	I was with this guy for 4 years and recently we've been having some problems. I was working too much and going to school and he wanted to hang out all the time. we stopped hanging out for about a month b/c i got so busy and now he has a new girlfriend but he still tries talking to me and i know he still for sure cares about me. The other day he asked me how many other guys i've been with, even when we were together we were kinda in an open relationship he would ask me that all the time. he was my first and i've only been with him. he's been with 15 girls. does it even matter whether i've been with other guys? why is he so paranoid? even when he got this new girlfriend he told me not to get with other guys? we've been "done" many times before but always ended up coming back to eachother, this is the first time someone else became involved and my feelings on that are a little intense. but I'm just wondering about this whole sex thing? and if i do have sex with someone else, should i tell him? i tried dating the other week but that just made me realize how much i care about him and i dont feel ready to find another guy but i'm just wondering why he keeps asking me that. and then he always responds to my response saying that he thinks i'm lying. throughout highschool no one would ever believe me that i was a virgin so i'm used to people not believing me with these kinds of things. but why does he care so much?
20090305022922AABY0wu	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it abuse when a Mother falsely calls children's aid society on her daughter serveral times?	Mother calls CAS serveral times (6) and made outrageuos allegations about her daughter.  Everytime CAS came and investigated and everytime it was proven that this Mother had lied to them.  Because this Mother has done this she is now considered a risk towards her grandchildren.  This Mother thinks that what she had done to her daughter was not abuse.  This Mother thinks that she did no wrong and refuses to unstand how CAS and the courts consider her the problem.  CAS is concerned over the ongoing conflict between the Mother and daughter and feel that this mother would be putting this daughter's children at risk.  CAS and the courts thinks that what this mother has done to this daughter is a form of abuse.  It is seen that what she (Mother) had done to be malious to try and discredit her daughter as a good parent.  CAS and the courts believe that having any further contact is not in the best interest of this daughter and her children because CAS and the courts believe that this Mother will keep on doing it.  What do you think?  Do you think it is abuse? Do you think that this Mother should be given anymore chances?  Do you think if this had been your Mother doing this to you and your children would you trust her? Would you allow her to visit your children even if she promised to never do it again, knowing that CAS and the courts thinks its not in the best interest because they believe she would do it again?  Or would you just listen to the CAS and Courts and simple cut your ties just to ensure it would never happen again.  Whole point to this question is that the Mother is in denial and doesn't understand or believe that what she done was wrong and was a form of abuse.  So the more people that answer this honestly then this Mother would understand where CAS and the courts are coming from.

20090305024303AAudG2D	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I find this person?	My boyfriend refuses to tell me the last name of this ex girlfriend of his, although he had me tell him my ex's last names and searched for pics of them on social networking websites. It's not like he forced me to say their last names, but I didn't have a problem with it. But he just won't tell me this one girl's last name and all I want to do is look at pics of her, that's it. But he thinks I am going to stalk her or something.... it's pissing me off to such a degree that I am trying to add ever girl with that first name to my social networking website, and asking every single one of them about him to see if she's the one. I added around 200 people already with her name and none of them is her and I am losing hope, I just don't know how to ******* do this anymore. It's so unfair..... that he won't tell me. And it also pisses me off cause it makes me feel like he's trying to keep her stupid last name sacred or something like not giving it out or whatever.. what should i do?
20090305024639AAAFdP2	Family & Relationships;Family	Who is it? is it me or mom?	The thing is im this fourth year high school student and all my life my mom has always favorited my brother. Sometimes i find it quite unfair but i dont mind it. The thing is we've always been fighting since my first my first year in highschool but now i couldnt take it so i started having episodes of crying all of a sudden.      Today I told her how I felt and she blamed it on me. The thing is on my LAST retreat I was the only girl in my whole class who's parent wasnt even present in the mass and the only girl who wasn't able to tell her parents how much she loved them. I forgave my dad because he said sorry. But my mom ddn't I dont know if it was her pride or her japanese culture but she was cold and blamed it on me that i did not remind her about it. I gave her a letter I told her but she refused to say that she did. So I let out everything that I had been keeping since first year and instead she just ignored it. I just left the car and cried, and thats how I started writing this.       And also about my ballet. She just always comments on how bad I am or that Im fat ( im already 17 and im 5'7 with a 24 waistline!!!! ) No matter how many diets i do she says Im fat. She always does,... and since thats the thing she likes to talk about i just follow on and tell her how fat I am and I agree even if I dont feel that way.       Now I just feel like running away. I don't mind actually if she said that I shouldn't go to college because she hates my course. She never tells me how good I am anyway. Yeah coz Im just a working student who earns around 500-600 dollars every month who's a dancer and a student with highly average grades... yeah if i had a daughter like this i'd make fun of her too.... She is the most ungrateful child ever... is what she says because i always complain and shout.... but who wouldnt after all I am a CHILD and NOT and adult... what does she expect.... Im just learning.... But who am I to say this maybe I am really wrong... So which one ? Is it my mom or is it just me?

20090305024449AA7xi7Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he mad/scared, or has he checked out?	Me: busy trying to finish my last quarter of school, sleepless, needy of affection.   Him: acting really withdrawn, busy working full time, taking grad classes, and surfing the net.      We live together, but have decided not to when the lease is up (i want to keep my cat, he hates it). I've told him that I want to stay nearby him and want to keep seeing him, but he says that if we're not living together, there's no point in dating anymore (ouch).  He says that he won't have time for me, as he'll be busy with his job, his classes, and his friends on weekends. That i should live as far away from him as possible, because it'll 'just be too hard'   Needless to say, I think this is bull. What I can't tell is if he's being genuinely serious about it, or if he's just babbling because I might have to move out of the city for work (which, if it does happen, won't be for at least another year. things could also change by then)      Does it sound like he's being stupid, or has he fallen out of love with me?

20090305025248AAsoBPA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What to do with my Momma's boy husband that wont stay with me but wont divorce me either?	My mother in law and I use to live in same roof but don't really get along. She fakes sickness in front of my husband, sleeps in front of our bedroom and criticize everything I do when I'm by myself. I finally reach my limit and with my little savings I moved out to a nearby apartment. I thought my husband will be following me but 2 months after I moved out he only visit me after his work but go home to his mother place at night. I told him if he cant stay with me why stay married. He said he wont give me a divorce because he loves me and will stay with me in the near future just give him time since his mom is sick. I still love my husband but I feel like I'm always 2nd to his mom and it seems that she's his priority instead of our marriage. What's the best thing to do?

So, there's this girl and she said she doesn't feel the same way and never will and everyone's telling me to get over it but what if I don't want to? I mean, I'll know when the **** hits the fan and stop but I spent way too long thinking about her to give up now and I'm not leaving with nothing. Unfortunately, I fell in love with her best friend but she broke my heart and I hated her for it but I got over it months ago and I'm trying to tell these two I'm better now, I'm past it all and I don't care now. Besides, this girl knows way too much about my problems (the reason why she doesn't like me) because I confided into her friend one night and I feel I should get some sort of reciporation for how much bad things she knows about me. Look, I'm not going to get over and you guys can't force me so if I want to keep pursuing her until I'M ready to stop, I shouldn't care what you think, I just don't want you to hate me for it.
20090305025547AAJ1Sud	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Has he done the wrong thing? Is my gut feeling right?	I been seeing this guy for the past few mths. We live 2hrs apart so only see each other once a fortnight for a weekend. He is a very jealous type. I'd get into trouble for giggling at something his brother said or not allowed to sit at the bar where he works as a bar attendant & have a drink while waiting for him to finish his shift...just in case a guy would come over & talk to me.       In the last few weeks he has been dictating who i can & cant be friends with...mainly my one good male friend.. I told him that was not fair..ive always been honest & loyal to him & my male friend is only a friend...Anyway...we broke up over it because i didnt like being controlled in that way. We had a terrible argument & he told me he hated me & had slept with another girl where he lives & who he works with....telling me how much better she was etc....all because i saw my male friend...with other female friends as well for drinks & I was totally honest in telling him this too. I had accepted the break up, he then told me he was lying about sleeping with her just to hurt me & make me hate him as much as he hates me.       A week later, being a few days ago, we got back together & agreed to give our relationship a good go. However...i had a strong feeling something had happened with her...he was different with me...even though we couldnt see each other...i could tell in his voice. So today i asked him: Did you go to her place? He said yes but with a work mate & only for an hour & there was nothing in it.  I said: Sure..thats why you said you slept with her..probably cause you like her or something, & that i dont really know what happened, or who went with you.. if anyone.      His next msg was instantly defensive & said: F**K this ****...Im over it. I just want to be single over all this bullshit..Sorry but cant do it anymore..I want to be by myself..Leave me alone now.      Which i am because i am over it too....I have not heard a word from him since...This is from someone who says he really loves me & wants to make it work.   To me theres a bit of guilt there, but i could be wrong.      I expected him to reassure me & tell me how much i mean to him but he did nothing & have heard nothing.      I feel something may have happened, he then got the guilts & wanted me back but couldn't be the same with me..then as soon as i question it he gets instantly defensive & dont hear from him again.      What do you think? Am i right? Please anyone?

20090305030342AAspqjv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Has my wife cheated or not and do i leave ?	I have been with my wife 8 yrs married 4 and with 2 beautiful kids, until recently we were a normal couple getting on with life having up and downs like any relationship i thought, apatrt from i was jealous husband   My wife started new job as air hostess and recently when i was working away she was going out twice and stayed at hotel that 2 nights and then i found out my wife is accuss of kissing 2nd pilot on night out twice , 2nd time being a the hotel.    My wife says she was with pal both nights at hotel and i cant prove she was as her pal does dirty behind her man and would stick up for her , so if i ask her she will say yes.   Then i let it die and month later someone says she slept with him as well as someone heard in next room when she went back to shared pilot accomadation which i also found out, she denys everything and does get upset about it when i bring it up ie tears, the rumours supposedly came from a gay air steward who is supposedly now seeing this pilot ie gay relationship.   I cannot prove nothing as excuses for everything. The main reason for Q is i want to try get over this and find out if he is gay etc, he is tranfserring airport and when i asked him on phone if he kissed wife or tried he said yes and whe month later i asked if he had sex he said yes then 1 hour later phoned me back and said he never and he took easy way out and said yes because  i said i would leave it if he told me truth and not go and see him etc.he is 22yr old skinny, i want this out of my life and basically find out if he gay if anything went on. If it is not true then i am putting my wife thrugh hell justnow but just upsets me everyday not knowing and i love my wife to bits and my kids but feel inside we have to seperate as i will not find out and makes her life hell and she said if i keep on like this then she will leave and she would have already if true and what i putting her through.   So do i forget and try be a non jealous husband or let leave and let her have her new moet champayne lifestyle . She said when she leaves in july i can ask her work etc anything but does not want hassle from work justnow but can i wait till july. why would all that rumours caom out just to hide 22yr old being gay. I wish i could believe her but with hotels and nights out how can i , i am to blame for that for being jealous when away etc.I really want to stay with wife but what can i do to forget etc and move on ?

My son will be 13 in a few months and he still wets the bed almost every night. According to halacha, he'll still become an adult whether there is a ceremony in shul or not. But he certainly isn't a "man" if he still wears diapers to bed. I'm sure you can imagine how I feel having to buy him "goodnites" at the supermarket. I fill up the cart with other things, then go to the diaper aisle, look around to make sure no one can see, then I put the goodnites in the cart under other things. Is taking away his bar mitzvah an acceptable punishment? Of couse, he can have the party as soon as he starts waking up dry.

20090305032224AAANlXB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband wants joint custody after years of abuse.?	After 21 years of abuse from this man and many years of abuse from his mother and sisters (until I stopped going around them) he left me. He informed me yesterday that he's going for joint custody of my two sons and that he's making me an offer that I really shouldn't refuse. Here it is- He says that he will probably get joint custody of the boys and that I can either accept his offer of 1,200 a month with the joint custody. He makes about 80k a year. He told me that he's trying to save me the money of having to get a lawyer. He says that he doesn't want things to get ugly and that he's trying to save me lots of pain. He's claiming that the judge will surely give him joint custody and give me 500 dollars a month. Is this really likely? Like I said, he abused me and the kids for years and years. When he left me I begged him to go get counseling with me. I know that I have issues too. He declined. Now, he keeps texting my son, calling him talking about this joint custody thing. My kids don't want to live with him, but they are afraid to tell him. Another concern... My husband has a mentally handicapped brother that has been in trouble for messing with kids. The brother lives with his mother. I know my husband is going to want to take the kids to her house. Can I stop this?

20090305033515AAsc4US	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get my ex boyfriend back when I think Ive completely pushed him away?	My boyfriend and I were together for 3 years and lived together for 2 of those years. 2 months ago he broke up with me and moved his stuff out of our house within a week because he said he didnt love me anymore and the spark was gone. We were fighting a far bit because we are both pretty stubborn and hot-headed. Since then I have been an absolute mess!! I have been contacted him and i guess hassling him for the past 2 months. He has been pretty good about it and talked me through my emotions and how to handle the situation. We have seen each other a lot since the break up, every couple of days as we have bills, accounts, etc that still need taking care of and also a small business that we ran together (I now am not involved). Pretty much every time we have seen each other I have been upset and asked for his forgiveness and asking him if we can work things out. He has been saying that he just needs time and that "if we dont do this the right way it will be a waste of time". He has said that he "i need to get in control of my emotions and he needs to fall in love with me all over again and get his priorities right but not straight away", he wants "freedom for a while". These things were said over 3 weeks ago and i feel like i have pushed him away within this time as now he has been telling me that we are not getting back together and that i should move on as "me having hope is a burden on both of us". Im not sure what to do now though, i realise that the incessant contacting him and wanting to sort things out has pushed him away. He has gone overseas for 2 weeks to see his family and we had breakfast the day before he left. we had a nice time but before we said goodbye i asked him if when he gets back if we could try and sort things out.. he said no because i keep pressuring him.   My question is should i just give up completely and try and get over him because i have ruined any chance of us getting back together. Or is there some way that i can redeem myself and possibly have a reconciliation with him.       He has been sleeping with other girls since the break up and telling everyone thats its over for good.      He is also still helping pay rent and bills at our house even though our lease has expired and he is no longer obligated to pay. He has not taken any of our furniture (apart from the spare bed) that we bought together as he said he doesnt need them.      HELP????

20090305034131AAZEz8F	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you kiss someone that has not had their first kiss?	If you are someone with a decent amount of experience and you are dating a guy with barely any, how can you do things with him without creeping him out? We are open with eachother, but won't it be awkward if he hasn't ever had a first kiss, and maybe does not know how to kiss?
20090305035057AAZiuaI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you leave the one you love?	Ok, so here goes the story..      I love my girlfriend VERY MUCH!! I love her so, and she loves me, and just every little thing she does for me make me melt back to her arms..      The thing is, when we're together sometimes, she keeps pushing my wrong buttons, she's still immature, but sometimes she's aware she's being a jerk and does it on purpose.. It hurts me, and I hate it.. like what the ____!?      We'd had a really rocky relationship so far, but it's getting better than before.. Sometimes I say to myself a lot I want to leave her, but I can't! Because I love her, and hope for things to change... but they change very little.. I can see she's really REALLY giving so much effort, and that she probably loves me more than I do to her.. but the way we are when we're together sometimes grates me.. Hurting me emotionally is what she does..      Before her, I came from a perfectly good relationship where everything turned out great (the girl was older than me by 6 years and was more mature than me) so we never had to handle things me and her are handling now.. sometimes she makes me feel like a trash abandoned somewhere.. She sometimes tell me she may hurt me cause she's probably still too immature..      I don't want to leave her because I LOVE HER!! Whenever she says she loves me, I just fall right back to her... But why am I having this thoughts of leaving her? I don't want to.. never in my life do I want to..      My thought says I sometimes don't deserve what she does and I deserve to be happier.. I guess.. But I love her..      HELP!!!

20061129171232AAWjwuA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you you think that Match.com or any online dating service is a rip off.?	I want to know that people go on online dating sites such as Yahoo Personals and Match.com or any other online dating site are a bunch of rip off. I used to go on Match.com and they charged me for a lot of money. I hate that. That's why I decided to not to used this site anymore and just stick with MySpace.com and Friendster.com and keep in touch with people I know from high school and college. I think that people who go on those Online Dating sites are being ripped off cause you have to pay a lot of monye for the bill. And also they could lie about themselves about what they list on their profile. They could be married or be a jail convict. Do you think that sites like Yahoo Personals and Match.com are a waist of time for singles and also a rip off in which the bills you have to pay? I want to hear about it.
20061126183540AAeuU1J	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are people on the Yahoo Personals or any online dating websites are a bunch of liars?	I heard that people that go on Online Dating websites such as Match.com or Yahoo Personals are liars. I had a former classmate of mine who is a liar and she goes on both Yahoo Personals and Match.com. She has a boyfriend now but I don't know why she still goes on those sites still. Usually people who go on that site and found a mate already have delete their profile. And she should have delete her profile if she has a boyfriend now but she still goes on those sites. She told me before that she met her boyfriend at a party of her friends... Is that really true that people who are in a relationship right now are going to end up just because of those sites which are fraud. I hope so for her who is a big fat liar. I hope that she gets busted one of these days.

He couldn't commit, so he broke it off, and now I've had the pleasure of meeting and spending time alone with her.  I felt an immediate connection, but two things are bothering me: she's 28 and I'm almost 23, and she already dated my cousin and feels a little awkward still associating with his (extended) family.  I really like her, and could see a future with her, but I don't want to put her in an awkward position.  What do I do?
20070109012213AAcQ8Qe	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What should I do if a girl that i loved for about 6 years is pregnant (not mine)?	I loved this girl for about 6 years and I never told her how i felt about her, even though there was a lot of chances on doing it. So a couple of months ago a friend told me that she was about 4 months pregnant. It was shocking news because she wasn't the type of girl that would get herself pregnant like that. Later that week I went to her house to talk to her and she told me that it was indeed true and that she didn't want to abort the baby so she was going to keep it. Then I asked about the father of the baby and if she's going to stay with him.  She told me that she is going to have to stay with him because it was the father (which i believe that she doesn't have to). So then I told her how i felt about her and she told me that she knew but just wanted me to tell her. I'm glad that she's having the baby in fact it's a girl and its due this February. BUT should I keep loving her and be a good friend and be by her side just incase the father leaves or to move on and forget about her?

20070211222635AANPYcJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you fall out of love?	i cant get over my exboyfriend. we were together for two years & it was wonderful up until the last few months of our relationship. we were madly in love with each other but at some point, he said he stopped loving me. it has almost been two years since we broke up and its been a total roller coaster. since our break up we had been unofficially on & off & i didnt really can enough about myself to stop this cycle. also it didnt help that he would randomly hint that he still cared about me in that way. a few months ago he told me that he still thought about us getting back together and that he always thought that if we did pursue a relationship again that he figured it would be forever. to top it all off, he said that he thought the chances of this happening were very good.  now, however he has a new girlfriend and says he's very happy, & im still in the same spot as before. i know he wasnt using, & i would explain if i werent out of typing room :) how the hell do i get over him?!
20070214184509AAQeVSM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ive forgotten how to talk to boys!?	so its been almost two years since my last relationship and ive only had a few encounters with guys since then and nothing ever lasted long. im good at being friends with boys, more so than with girl. i was raised with two brothers and no sisters so im used to hanging out with the guys, but only in a friendlike way.      i always get so shy when im around somebody that i think i like so i never know what to say. i think i have a great sense of humor and am an all around fun person, but i always freeze when that certain someone is near. its like i forget how to be me.      my guy friends are always telling me how good-looking i am, as most of them have confessed to liking me at some point (mostly they comment on my big boobs hehe:) ) but i know that this doesnt do me any good if i cant be myself.  someone help me out!!!! please!

20070227083712AAc5vrM	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do i get over his past? (regards to his ex's)?	I dont really know why but i get REALLY upset (to the point of crying, then depression, then anger) when I think about my boyfriend being with any other woman-mostly the women hes already been with. He has "been with" five other women, 4 out of the 5 were whores( or what i would define them as). Two times he has slept with them on the first date-when he barely even knew them. It makes me sick to think that the guy i love has been with ho's, esp when i lost my virginity to him (3 months into dating). Like I waited for someone special, and i didnt find out about his past until after the fact. I know there is nothing he or I can do about it now, but it still bothers me so much. I tried talking to him once, but he got mad and even made me more upset by saying he slept with them bc they were "sexy" (ive seen pictures....NOT sexy) and he said never regrets anything hes done.i just need to know how i can get over this.we have been going out more than a yr but i still get sick over it pls help

20070301063521AAt9tFE	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Mid-Life Crisis in Women. Alcoholic Wife went on hormone therapy and now has had affairs, into cyber-sex etc.?	Wife now in re-hab for 30 days detox.  Post Meno-pausal, over 50 yrs old. Went on hormone therapy about a year ago.  She got in touch via internet with old boyfriend from high school who lives half-way across country. They chatted for a period of weeks and he mentioned a cyber-sex site to her. I travel for work and I guess she was bored. She visited  East Coast twice in the past year and had sexual, not emotional affairs with this guy but her E-Mail shows it was just sex and it was only a couple of times. She got into cyber-sex and camming. She had a sexual encounter with a guy she met on the inter-net recently. Just found out.I was looking for some insurance info and found some E-Mails and when I looked at her computer I found out these things that had been happening. She blames it all on the alcohol. I think hormones partly to blame. Alcohol use had become excessive, one fifth or more a day. Married 24 years. Does not want divorce and neither do I but I am the victim here. Any ideas.

20070302192104AANWJtI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How does one know they are good in bed?	If you have had a brief sexual affair with a very experienced man who really knows his way around the lady parts (bringing you to Orgasm 3 times!!!), how does one know you are up to his standards?  I feel really sexually inexperienced compared to this guy, and it's just a casual thing so I don't want to be that insecure girl who outright asks if i'm good in bed!  When we've been together, we have sex at least 3 times per night.  He's 37 and i'm 28, and we don't really talk or have anything in common except we both want to get laid.        I don't want a relationship with him, just sex, and i'm not even sure I can do that because I dont' feel a spark between us and good sex is just 'good' not 'amazing' if the emotional connection is not there.   Plus, his house is dirty and he's a little socially inept and he lives over an hour away.        Regardless, I'm just wondering how a girl is supposed to know how a guy feels a woman is up to par sexually for him.  Serious answers only please.  Thanks!
20070302200727AA4VDTx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hot girl offers second date but doesn't call.  Let it go or let her know that is disrespectful? Aah, lesbians.	So, I talked to this girl on the phone for six hours last weekend.  Then, I missed the Oscars to go on a "spur of the moment" date.  We agreed on a second date for this weekend and she said she'd call.  I left a message Weds and she never returned it.  Clearly, she's not interested.  Should I let it go or should I call her on her sh*t?  She should know that is not the way to treat a girl!  Respect is in order, I do believe.  What do you think?  Or, should I just let karma have its way with her?  Thanks!

I know I’m beautiful and that other men think so as well. I’ve been on a diet (before this all happened) but now don’t feel like loosing weight anymore. I feel crappy about myself now and hurt because I do not wish to look like the kind of women he wants (blond hair/ green eyes/pasty white) yet I want to be his everything. I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder and all but I don’t understand why he can not just check out hot women. Or why he would look at plain women (which I find very insulting) when he has a very attractive and attentive women already?

Especially if there is someone I like. So, yeah, that's a common issue, but I can't even tolerate looking at the person's general direction. I even try my best to ignore the person if we meet outside of the uni. So, any suggestions, advice, that sort of thing?

20070319135548AAIgvPm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend and i broke up, and i think it was a mistake.?	The 1st time we broke up was two weeks ago. Because a guy kissed me, who i like and known for a year. He likes me as well. My boyfriend broke up with me and left for ABQ. Well four days later, he called and asked 2 get back 2gether. I wasn't sure, but i went 4 it. I was just 2 agree to say away from the other guy, who does go 2 skool w/me. well over the weekend, he came 2 my house to hang out. my boyfriend seen it and called and asked what he was doing @ my house. i said were gonna hang out. he said if i go with him, it would be over. i didn't think and went anyway,and he said it was over. now my boyfriend left to Arizona. well this guy really wanted 2 be w/me and so did i, but i luv my boyfriend. but i lost him, and this guy told me he had a girlfriend in Phoenix. So now were not together. I want my boyfriend back, but i don't know where he is, he left yesterday. I don't know if he'll except me back, he loves me too. I don't know what 2 do.
20070320144748AAFqrIT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Man troubles please help me!!! I need your advise?	I've been dating this guy for a year now and he still doesn't want to call me his girlfriend!!! Its so strange because I've met all of his friends (which he would not have done if he wasn't in to me) and he has told his parents about me too. But he will not say that I am his girlfriend!!! Sometimes he acts as if he is not in to me at all. We stopped talking for about two months and then he emails me out of the blue. Then when we meet up he grabs me and holds me for a long time (something that he doesn't do) but now he acts as if he doesn't care about me!!! He tells me that he doesn't care if I date other people but when he suspected me of dating someone else he got jealous (he tried to hide it though) and then he started ignoring me as if he was upset. I don't know what is up with him!! I've asked and he gives bullshit answers like "I don't know what your talking about" He is so cold at times. Should I just let him go? I'm confused!!!! Why is he like this?
20070321102058AAZks9K	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help Please . x?	Theres a girl my friend, who by trying to help me out told him things which she thought would convince him that I do really like him.But this didnt work and it made him think I have been going behind his back, from where she said ' her ex boyfriend called her and she said no coz ov u'. So he has been unsure? if thats how I could put it , of the relationship. We have arguements, and eventually I told him how i felt. and since then we got on really well . But after a small problem this weekend I'm unsure of whats going on.He keeps inviting me back round, and he complains if I dont contact him.Should I just ask him how he feels? Or should I just carry on as I am and see for myself.I know I can make him happy the only problem is im a few years younger than him, I live around 20 minutes away and I have school and coursework commitments.I want to be with him but all I can think is that he is not interested, would like me to stop texting him, and hed rather be with someone a bit older.Help?xx

20070321104358AATbz5t	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will I ever get over him?	Ok, I fell in love when I was 18.  I was with the guy for two and a half years.   I truly believe he was my soul mate, but he also hurt me really bad.  We have been broken up for a year or so now, and I don't want to be with him, but I don't want to really open up and let anyone else in.  I am dating this new guy, and he's great, but Im always think about my ex.  I wonder how hes doing, if hes doing ok, and stuff like that... and I am afraid I will never let myself love anyone else again????/

20070321164438AAY4Cq9	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can someone help me out?	Last night my partner and I were on the couch and I had asked her to sew the button on my pants and she said ok.  She finally decided to after so many hours and then she had asked me to go get the sewing kit to fix the pants.  Ofcourse, please note that she said it in a sarcastic way like 'o you need it for tomorrow and go get it if you want it done'..so I said 'you know where it is go get it for me' She then did not for a while and then she started having a tantrum saying I was a child and etc.  She finally decided to get the kit herself and was pissed off.  I was as well but I calmed down.  After so, I asked her are you calm now?  And, then she started rambling more about the problem.  Then, it resulted to a huge arguement.  Because, lately I have just had it with her.  Am I in the wrong here?  Was I supposed to just get the sewing kit and not care of the attitude she gave me?

I have a very good friend of the family, but latley I've been giving her a cold sholder because I feel she dosn't respect my opinions.        Unfourtently, I've been very hypacrtical and mean behind her back all day today, because she asked me to do something, and I got greedy and wanted money.       My wife then tells some of the thing I've been saying about her to her.  She got upset and told me that if she's going to affect my family, she'll leave me along.  now I feel really really bad, I worry about her now,  was just venting, I didn't mean for it to go this far, what should I do?      deep down I care, but I really have problems communicating.  Now she's hurt and won't talk to me.  and I'm having a problem facing her.

20070423162350AAv2Kz3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Destiny or just pathetic hope?	I hope this will be my last question concerning my very weird ex-relationship with a guy online. I happened to fall in love with him badly and I think I was actually in love with his potential and not himself as he is now. I think the person he represented to be was someone he could be, just that he choses not to be and choses an alcohol addiction as an easier way out. As he once said, he is weak as a person. The problem is that I am so hooked on this feeling that we will end up together. It's like my heart has been telling me for years that he is the one. Can it be just that I am hanging on this hope that we will end up together one day or maybe my hunch is correct and we are actually destined? I know noone can exactly answer me that, but what I ask is: If I feel this inevitability about us, that no matter how long time passes, that life will bring us together? Did something like this happen to you??

I take her back on the conditon that she will be honest with me..she just cant..I feel like I am the crazy one?  Did I cause this by treating her well, and trying to help her???

We both know that we care for eachother but it may be more than i expected. He thinks that he may 'love' me. i dont know how to respond to it if he actually tells me that.

20070424081901AAGJ4o2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please Help!....?	Ok...so here's the deal....my boyfriend and I have been dating for 2 1/2 years now. I love him to death and I know he loves me as well. For the last I'd say 6 months we have been talking about moving in together (even submitted an application one time and almost moved in). Well due to current family issues on my side...we had to move up the move in date. It went from May to now early September. Well for the last 2 1/2 years it has just been me and my boyfriend...no one else. In June his friend of years is moving back up here and now he's talking about moving in with him instead of me. He says that he needs "freedom" that it has nothing to do with me but he just wants to be able to do whatever he wants when he wants..no questions asked. I have to admit that I have not been easy on him about going out and stuff but I have tried to change. He says that he wants to be able to do stuff with his friends and family so once when do move in together he doesnt regret anything.
