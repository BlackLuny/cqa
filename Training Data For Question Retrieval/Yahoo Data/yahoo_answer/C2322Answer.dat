3oK5N9tIaa	O indivíduo possue 46 cromossomos que definem exatamente suas mais diversas particularidades e tendências à doen?as. <br>  Certas anomalias aparecem quando existe um aumento de<br>  únicamente 1 cromossomo.

Por algum motivo, que nem a ciência explica, a adi??o de um único cromossomo<br>  pode quaser tudo o que você sabe.<br>  <br>  Tem um vídeo, espetacular, muito bem feito, que se chama:<br>  *CHROMOSONE PACKAGIN* que você pode baixar no You Tube, foi feito há um ano atrás, mais ou menos.<br>  Dê uma olhada, vale a pena!<br>  <br>  Quanto à sua *R?*, a espécie tem maior número de gametas, pois a fecunda??o n?o é com a da mulher.

Já uma pessoa normal e muito mais complexa pois tem o total e perfeito funcionalmento de suas células apresenta 46 cromossomos.<br>  <br>  2) Acho que vc quiz dizer r? (família do sapo). Bom caso seja r?, ela produz muito mais gametas do que uma mulher pois sua fecunda??o é externa, ou seja, a fecunda??o n?o é feita dentro do animal. Os gametas sao liberados na água com isso a maior quantidade de gametas garante a maior seguran?a de fecunda??o, pois est?o em ambiente aberto.

Se você já tem uma base e usa isso como complemento, com certeza vai ajudar no seu aprendizado.<br>  <br>  Eu mesma uso isso pra n?o perder o hábito e tenho até aprendido algumas coisas em francês e italiano por esses métodos. Mas daí a realmente aprender a língua é outra história. <br>  <br>  Filmes e músicas, além de nem sempre seguirem as regras corretas da língua, costumam ter muitas gírias e sotaques, o que n?o é interessante para quem está aprendendo... E você disse que entende a conversa, mas você consegue conversar bem (elaborar frases com sentido e tudo mais) e escrever corretamente? Acho que é aí que você descobre se realmente sabe uma língua: quando você aprende a pensar na língua.<br>  <br>  Lembre-se: conseguir se comunicar em uma língua n?o quer dizer que você saiba ela, como nos mostram a Nico e a ?

Ele decide voltar à ilha onde passou vinte e oito anos de sua vida. Lá encontra seus amigos espanhóis que o haviam ajudado a sair da ilha.

952f9fa730ec743a13dd8728c6d1262faa	Il Naturalismo è un movimento letterario che nasce in Francia come applicazione diretta del pensiero positivista e si propone di descrivere la realtà psicologica e sociale con gli stessi metodi usati dalle scienze naturali. La voce narrante nel naturalismo riproduce il modo di vedere e di esprimersi dell'autore, del borghese colto, e tale voce interviene spesso con giudizi sia espliciti che impliciti. Tra il narratore e i personaggi vi è un distacco netto: il narratore allontanandosi dall'oggetto e guardandolo dall'alto,adotta il punto di vista dello scienziato.<br>  <br>  Il termine positivismo indica una corrente filosofica, sociologica e culturale che si sviluppa nella seconda metà dell'Ottocento ed è caratterizzata dalla fiducia nel progresso scientifico e dal tentativo di applicare il metodo scientifico a tutte le sfere della conoscenza e della vita umana.|`|qvArhTo2aa	Il termine positivismo indica una corrente filosofica, sociologica e culturale che si sviluppa nella seconda metà dell'Ottocento ed è caratterizzata dalla fiducia nel progresso scientifico e dal tentativo di applicare il metodo scientifico a tutte le sfere della conoscenza e della vita umana.<br>  Il naturalismo è in letteratura quel movimento che nasce in Francia alla fine dell'Ottocento come applicazione diretta del pensiero positivista e che si propone di descrivere la realtà psicologica e sociale con gli stessi metodi usati dalle scienze sociali.|`|fTqJ6uz8aa	il naturalismo è quando una persona ha un espressione naturale o impassibile e positibo quando guarda il mondo da una parte allegra....CIAO

Q4IguUL6aa	Not Australia - there are no scholarships available and you have to prove that you have enough money to support you (at least 12K US) plus the study fees (approx 20K per year) to get in.<br>  <br>  All Australian students get an allowance from the government (Austudy) to pay for incidentals etc, so there is no need for scholarships.|`|c40xw06Xaa	I'm sure there are scholarships and other programs that will help you. Also depending on your G.P.A. you may be able to get more money, you should go to your financial aid office or college adviser and ask questions about available programs.
zCOvQwQhaa	1) There are indeed MA/MS degrees offered online in Human Resources.  Some from some very good colleges.(Central Michigan, Colorado State, Clemson, East Carolina, Western Carolina, Indiana State, Kansas State, Penn State, U Ct., U OK., UTexas, Boise State, Boston U, SUNY-Buffalo, Florida State, Middle Tennessee State, NC State, SUNY-Stony Brook, U Illinois, U Wisconsin, Webster U)  Bellevue even has their PhD in Human Capital Management (HR) significantly online.  HR is one of those subjects where graduate study and online study are ideally suited since at this level you will be conducting considerable research on your own time.<br>  <br>  2) An MBA in HR will be just as useful, possibly more useful, as an MA/MS in HR unless you want to teach college later - in which case you'll want a PhD and the MA/MS is a better path to the PhD.  Make sure you need another degree in HR at all.  If you really like the field then it might be useful but the BA in HR and the MA/MS in HR both qualify an entry level generalist.  You might be better served, since you will have the bachelor's in the field already, looking at a specialist master's degree in an HR subfield such as training, labor relations, I/O Psych - Org Behavior, etc.  Getting the MBA would open your options beyond the HR function but it too is a generalist degree.  The MBA only has true value (unless it's from a top school) when combined with relevant work experience leading to a senior management position.<br>  <br>  3) Yes, you should be able to get into an MBA program from HR depending on your GPA and GMAT scores.  The best programs will require that you have some work experience first.  The MBA is designed for people that don't have an undergraduate degree in business but need the business administration education.

AA10541105	No one can positively tell you what will get you in because no one really knows. I was talking to a Harvard student the other day, and he said he wasn't even sure. Heck, no one is really sure of what gets them into the top colleges. Here are some basic guidelines to help you though:<br>  Grades/Transcript- This is obviously at the top of the list. If you can't get it together in high school then how are you supposed to get it together in college? They want a student who can settle down and study.<br>  Extracurriculars- Despite the hype- these alone will not get you into Harvard or any other good school. You do need to show that you are focused, and that is usually why these are so vital. Service organizations such as Key Club show your spirit while sports and dance show your ambition and dedication. There are lots of extracurriculars out there; find some that fit YOU. Don't do something just because you think it will get you in to a good college.<br>  Service- Like I said before, this shows your spirit. A person who does community service and does it from the heart is a person who will try to help others succeed in a college environment, and that is what colleges really want. BEWARE though; too much volunteering can make you look fake and unconcerned.<br>  Essay and Recommendations- These are huge!!! Essays show your character. Don't write your essay with the intention of wanting to get in; write it with the intention of showing them who you REALLY are. Don't put too much drama in, but also don't be too light about it. Find a nice balance and stick with it! The recommendations are also vital. Don’t butter your teacher up, and make sure to give them plenty of time to fill them out! Loads of teachers mention if you ‘accidentally’ forgot to give them an envelope or if you only gave them a week to write out what they think of you.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your future, and remember these tips!|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Guy, this is not a reasonable question. <br>  <br>  Harvard is probably the most famous university in the world. Every year 20,000 or more of the very best students in the world apply, and 19,000 of them are turned away. <br>  <br>  They turn down at leat 1000 valedictorians a year. They turn down kids with 800 score SATs who were presidents of their classes and captains of the football team.  <br>  <br>  If you want to get into Harvard, (assuming you are not the son of a billionaire who is going to give them a new building or two!) you need to be one of the very best, if not THE best student in your school, provided that your school has a reputation for very good scholastics. In addition, yes you need Extra Curricular things, but it is not useful to just line up a list of clubs you belonged to. Schools like Harvard and just a few other are inundated with kids who are really good. But what they want is someone who is exceptional - who is a leader, a mover and shaker, an individual who clearly stands out from all the other excellent students. <br>  <br>  Provided that you have VERY good scholastic records in every department, and that you have done the usual extracurricular stuff - being in a few clubs and so on -- then what have you done that makes you stand out, preferably on a national level, from all the other capable kids in America and the world?<br>  <br>  If you dont have a very good answer for that, then you need to start looking at some of the other excellent colleges that are not so competitive as Harvard.  There are over 2000 schools in the USA that give Bachelor's degrees.... look around and see which one is a match for you.

You can take off your glasses (if you have them), and then you won't actually "See" your classmates.  Or you can picture your classmates in their underwear, that's supposed to help.  However depending on what some of them look like it may not be a good idea, after all vomiting would really go over to well!!<br>  <br>  Okay, do your very best on your assignment, practice in front of people you feel comfortable with,  and realize that being perfect is not what matters.

What exactly is it you want to study?<br>  In general, one needs to apply to a college or university in order to take a class.  For us, a college has only Bachelor's degree programs, while a university has graduate level classes as well.  However, Americans tend to use the two words interchangeably, so "college admissions exams" are also university admissions exams.  If you're coming straight out of secondary school, you can apply to either.<br>  Good luck with the college/university applications.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	It was an old custom to use the word "college" to refer to high schools.

They are happy to have foreign students, as long as the students can pay the tuition and fees.
DCQc92Tiaa	Think back to your own school experiences.... What lessons did you enjoy the most? Sitting dictating notes or copying from the board? Or lessons which you got to explore and share what you were learning? And more importantly (at the time at least,) from which lessons could you remember what you learned?<br>  <br>  If a lesson doesn't engage students they are less likely to learn and pay attention, and the best way to avoid this is to make lessons interesting. Including activities which cater to different learning styles (eg, drawing, writing, watching, speaking, doing) will ensure that everyone gets something out of what you are teaching. If no one is interested in what you are teaching, what is the point of doing so?|`|inZ9CWBiaa	Yes, The only way to appeal to a variety of learners is to provide a variety of activities to cater to their styles.

But we've all been there, and alot of others are also going through it with you right now. Probably the biggest question you need to ask yourself then, and be honest, is why every body else seems to be able to get it done with time to relax at lunch time and you feel overloaded. What are you doing that is different?, Are you taking extra courses?<br>  <br>  It's easy to convince yourself that you are working flat out when often times, and this was the case for me, I performed badly in quizes and had loads of homework because I was easily distracted in class and wasn't getting the work done, as a result I had to spend the equivalent of my scheduled class time at home teaching myself the work, often finding assignments difficult because I hadn't learnt what was expected in class that day.<br>  <br>  Its difficult to tell from your question if you have other big things going on at home perhaps, which are adding to your pressures. Your school, as required by law, will have a pretty good support network set up for students feeling as much pressure as you describe, don't feel too proud to talk to them.<br>  <br>  With regard to your essay/literary notebook, why are they too difficult for you and why would you look to the internet for help?? Maybe your teacher will be a bit easier on you about the quality of your work if they can see you're putting an effort in and making a really honest attempt to understand rather than letting it defeat you, they don't know what you do while you're at home, so ask your teacher not google/yahoo for help!!<br>  <br>  This may seem harsh but thats not the intention, I no what its like, its the kind of reality check I needed because I also had convinced myself teachers were the worst people in the world and the workload was impossible, but I quit stuffing around in class, ignoring my friends distractions, because if I paid attention in class I had no problem understanding how to do assignments and I also got to have lunch with my mates. I now have an honours degree in biotechnology (trust me its way harder than high school) and a happy life, and all the sudden the parties/lunch time/surfing that I thought I so tragically missed out on, are so insignificant.<br>  <br>  I think however that you need to seek help in person, often better to talk to someone completely disconnected from you, say a school counselor, the HSC is really tough and you don't want it to get on top of you before you have a chance to prove what you're capable of. I think you will do fantastically, you are obviously a very commited person, but maybe with very high expectations of yourself which are beyond achieving. Promise me you will talk to someone who is not on Yahoo! Its somebodies job to help you okay.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

UA8USXFNaa	Hey, if you want to study at one of the universities which require the UKCAT, then I'm afraid you would have to go next year - it's not possible to switch courses in the second year as the subject matter you would have covered would be different. No degree courses allow you to do that. You also definitely need to do the test before applying. However - have you considered applying to one of the universities which don't require the UKCAT? They include some fairly prestigious universities eg Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool, and probably more that I'm unaware of. If I were you I'd do some research into it as it would be a shame to have to wait a year because of one missed deadline. Good luck!|`|WhTWIH5Qaa	Well firstly make sue you need the UKCAT and not anything else like the BMAT.<br>  <br>  2ndly, you can always wait a year and take it next year and have fun during your gap year (or even better volunteer)<br>  <br>  3rdly you could enter a chemistry/biology field and then do graduate medicine (which means you'll work harder than normal medicine!)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8e3daa7b6fcd955fc6bd1d149eb12c13aa	You can go for the Braford Clinical sciences course, then 2nd yr go to leeds for medicine (if you make it, that is).<br>  Leeds, King's, Georges, Southampton, UEA - have 6 yr "conversion" courses but you usually have to have AAA in subjects other than science i.e. for those who only just realised they really want to do medicine and just picked the wrong subjects. Or Some of them don't accept A Level students though, so have a look at the criteria on their websites.<br>  King's have a 6 yr course which accepts A Levels but you have to live in one of the boroughs listed on their website. (I'm not sure if you need UKCAT for these, but I know King's run their own test anyway so don't know if they would use it)<br>  Some unis in the past didn't want UKCAT but not sure now|`|Acm5Af8Caa	i dont no

JZllqdeLaa	L'omino verde.<br>  L'omino verde è verde, ha gli occhi verdi, ha i capelli verdi, ha il sorriso verde, ha i denti verdi, ha il nasino a patata verde, ha le orecchie verdi, se avesse la barbetta ce l'avrebbe verde (è ancora giovane), ha la pelle verde e quando vede una ragazza particolarmente bella non arrossisce bensì diventa verde. Ama vestire in verde durante la settimana e nei giorni festivi invece si veste di verde. Lui è modesto quindi non ama vantarsi dei propri record personali e nemmeno della sua collezione di cravatte verdi, ne ha ben 1400 dal verde a pois verdi al verde a righe verdi. Lui in verità ne porta una diversa ogni giorno ma la gente stranamente non se ne accorge, anzi lo prende continuamente in giro perchè pensa che abbia addosso sempre la stessa cravatta. A carnevale, ricorrenza a lui molto cara, apre l'armadio e prende il costumino posato lì con cura l'anno prima. Il suo è il costume più originale del mondo. E' tutto rosso, da capo a piede e quando lo indossa si sente rivivere dentro. Perchè? Perchè lui in verità non è l'omino verde che tutti credono, è invece l'omino rosso che tutti gli anni a carnevale toglie il costume verde per ritornare rosso come lui ama essere.|`|GRUFmiMEaa	ma fai la descrizione della tua donna!!!

Some Ambulance companies have Tuition assistance for EMT-Basics wanting to become EMT-Paramedics.<br>  <br>  But at the College, Apply for the EMT Program.  If you completed the Pre-Reqs, and EMT-B course and licensed/working as an EMT-B, chances of being accepted are VERY good.  <br>  <br>  Taking the College route will take 2.5 to 3 years.

Which is basically saying 2 x 2 = 4 backwards. 2 is the square root of 4 because 2 x 2 = 4.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	There are many colleges in the USA BUT- very important - there are some scams and phony schools that will rip you off. You must be careful. <br>  <br>  In the USA all the respectable schools are checked out and accredited by groups known as the "regional accreditation". There is one for the northeast US, one for the South, etc. <br>  <br>  Before you spend ONE RUPEE for any US school, you must check to see that it is properly accredited. This would not be hard. All you have to do is check any list of schools in the US and pick two or three in the state where your online school has its offices. Say, you had an online university in the state of Louisiana, then just look for one of the main schools in that state - so in Louisiana that would be Louisiana State University or Tulane University. Go to the website for that school and you will see something like this:<br>  <br>  "Tulane University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033-4097; Telephone number 404-679-4501) to award bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees. " <br>  <br>  that quote is from the front page of Tulane's website. <br>  <br>  Do not send ONE DOLLAR  to any school unless they are accredited by the same association as the other respected schools in the area. <br>  <br>  I am fairly familiar with American colleges but I never heard of Argosy before, however, they do seem to be accredited. So, I don't know how good they are, but they do seem to be a legitimate school. Maybe they are pretty good... check it out and see how they do in the rankings....|`|9e380d63b3381ceef8c0bc3270f9025daa	I have no experience with Argosy, but I have a negative opinion of it. They are quite aggressive, and at one point they were calling me in such a manner that my caller id would say something like "3014." In other words, the caller would use some sneaky method to conceal the identity of the caller. I don't remember how I found out who had been repeatedly calling me, but it was definitely Argosy. <br>  <br>  I have taught at various schools, and I know that many of them are only rackets. Please be very careful before you plunk down any money. Look critically at their employment records. <br>  <br>  Schools do play with statistics in such a manner as to make themselves look good. Please think carefully before you choose a school.|`|57515049b2d72e59fbb10b3bca9b46e3aa	Great school.

" <br>  that quote is from the front page of Tulane's website. <br>  <br>  You can compare what it says on Centrals website with what it says on the website of UMich or MichState. It should have the same accreditation that they do.
AA10026907	Ponder to think as to how   Washington University got your contact address. Most probably College Board provided them with this. It is a service which College Board sells to interested Universities. <br>  While taking  SAT test your details were collected by the Board.<br>  The scores  were tabulated and made available to the colleges. <br>  Thus this is not an offer of admission from Washington  but only an invitation to apply to all those who scored above certain benchmark.<br>  Incentives do get better results for universities as in any other competitive activity.<br>  If you are a good catch for Washington  you may be a potential material for Columbia.Consider this.<br>  Good Luck<br>  NBS|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	If you check the US News and some other sites you will see that the admission to the top schools is extremely competitive. Columbia, Princeton, Harvard and other similar schools reject up to 90% of their applicants. And, they get thousands of really well qualified applicants, so they arent just rejecting unqualified dummies.<br>  <br>  Washington U is supposed to be a good school, but they are also notorious for handing out a lot of scholarship money to buy good students from around the  country. I know four young people who went there - two loved it, two hated it and left after a year. So, you will have to ask around a lot and see what people say. Do they have good kids because they buy them, or because the very best kids choose to go there?<br>  <br>  I notice online that Harvard Yale and Stanford each have over 200 National Merit scholars enrolled in last years class, and Wash U has 198. The difference is, Harvard Yale and Stanford didnt give any of those kids NM scholarships, while Wash U gave NM scholarships to 145 of them. So that explains the difference between the schools. <br>  <br>  Wash U is supposed to be a good school,. though. So if they offer you money you will have a tough choice.... Wash for a discount, Columbia for full price.... which is better for you?
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	An A.A. degree is "Associate in Arts" It is a "two year" degree, so it requires basically four semesters if you are able to do full time study, or a total of about 16 courses that need to be completed. It might be a little more if it is a degree in a technical field or a field like Art where you need to do studio or lab classes. <br>  <br>  This is the degree that is normally given by Community Colleges. Most Community colleges have classes in the evening and weekends so that people who are working can also pursue their educations.  After you finish your AA in many cases you can be admitted directly to your state university, and all the credits that you took on your AA will count at the university towards your BA or Bachelor of Arts - that is the four year degree that is considered the standard, basic degree for nearly all USA colleges and universities.<br>  <br>  Community colleges are a good deal.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Some colleges are famous for admitting a lot of students who have family members who previously graduated. Two schools famous for this are Harvard and Notre Dame, but a lot of schools do it. <br>  <br>  But what exactly do you mean by a "legacy admission?" If you mean that the kid got in just because his parent went there, then I'd say the % is close to zero. Good schools like Harvard and Notre Dame take only students who are good enough to succeed there. There arent going to take a kid who will fail or do badly, just because the kids parent went there 40 years ago. <br>  <br>  When they are deciding who to admit, one of the things they can add to the balance is, whether or not the kid really has a good feel for the school and whether or not the kid is likely to show up if they do admit. So in both cases, legacies are a good deal for the school and the student. The school gets a student who is already familiar with the layout, and the student gets to go to a place that they already have an attachment to.

You can take the tests as many times as you want (for a fee of course) and they do help you get into a college. A common myth is that these tests count for everything, but in fact they don't. The tests simply measure you against other students across the country in math, critical reading, and writing skills.

There is a test on writing, a test on reading and vocabulary, and a test on math. Then there are a whole bunch of tests that check different subjects like biology or French or whatever subject you want to take.  <br>  <br>  When you apply for college most of the colleges require that you send them a report on your scores for this set of test. They use the SAT scores along with your HS grades to decide if you will be allowed to come to that college. <br>  <br>  A lot of kids across the USA take this test - way more than a million every year. The scores on the tests are from 200 to 800 with the average score about 500. If you are REALLY smart, you might get a perfect 800, but not too many kids can do that.  Most kids used to take two SAT tests and the score would add up to like 1000 or 1100. So if you had a total of 1400 that would be much better than average and everyone would beimpressed. But now most kids take three SAT tests so the scores are higher, like for all three it would total 1500 or if you were way better than average, it would be 2200 or something like that.

Unfortuantely there are very few jobs for people with a BA or BS in biology, and they mostly pay poorly. Probably your best best would be to start as a high school bio teacher, if you can find a job. If you want to do biology for a career, you really need a PhD and that is going to take a long time (at least 6 years past regular college) and even then there is no guarantee that you will get any job at all.  If you are going to major in bio then you have to do it because you have a total passion for biology and just can't imagine yourself doing anything else. <br>  <br>  Biology is a lot of fun, but I am glad I had a backup skill!!!!

He was within walking distance of the center of town. In his cabin he had three chairs (another famous quote, why he did that) and often had visitors. And the place where he lived was NOT wilderness... the town he was in had been settled for nearly 200 years. In fact, in his writings he complains about how the forest is so much different from what it was before the settlers came there. <br>  <br>  So, it wasnt about getting off to the wilderness or being alone for long periods of time.... you will have to read the book to see what it WAS about. <br>  <br>  By the way, Walden pond is a state park now (about 15 miles from downtown Boston). They have a beach and you can go for a swim, like Thoreau did. They also have a model of his cabin near the ranger station so you can see just what it looked like.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	I don't think anyone will hold yor nursing degree against you, but as you point out, it clearly didnt include the courses you need to be admitted to Medical school. So, you have to take those courses. Many students finish a college degree and then take a year to finish off any med school prereqs that they didnthave in their normal curriculum.<br>  <br>  You can check the website of the Association of American Medical Colleges and it tells  lot about med school application. You'll notice in their statistics that the average age for entering med school is 24-25. That means that a lot of the entering studens took a gap year. You could spend that year in nursing and completing your prereqs.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	What you say is quite true , in a sense. It is the reason why - despite the expense and stress - many thousands of smart kids want so desperately to get into good schools. The elite schools do not award any credit for the "AP" courses in high school, but these schools can be the difference between your future success being a long shot  vs being almost a sure thing. To succeed there, you must enter with a very strong academic background as, no matter how smart you are, you will be in school with kids who are your peers in intelligence, and ahead of you in education.. <br>  <br>  I taught at a low level school, and also lectured at an Ivy. The freshmen students at the Ivy school knew more, understood new ideas faster and were in every possible way better students than the Seniors in seminars at the low level school. The Ivy kids  were already well-educated when they arrived, but they were headed for important careers where they would have a major impact on their communities - many of them had already done so. The low level kids were often stunningly ignorant, and were just trying to get themselves to a level where they would be able to do a reasonably complicated job without humiliating themselves. Some of them will never make it.|`|FiVza29Qaa	I am astonished and disappointed in Matt's answer.  The desire to get into an Ivy league university depends on the person, not the perceived "level" of the person's high school. What exactly is a "low-level" high school, Matt? What value are you contributing to these students' lives when you say that "they will never make it"? As an educator, you should approach these education gaps with more ambition and positivity than that. If I had educators like you in my life, I would never have the courage to challenge myself.<br>  <br>  Now to answer the question completely, mastering (not just taking) AP/IB classes are a help to getting into college in general. Never underestimate the potential and possibility of getting into the university, no matter what "level" the high school. If the person believes that they have performed exceptionally well in high school, then by all means they should apply to an Ivy league university. The worst that can happen is that they say "no". Also, DO NOT overestimate the "actual" quality of Ivy leagues and make decisions built on other people's perceptions. Do your research and find out for yourself if Ivy league is where you want to be. There are highly successful people who have graduated from other schools.|`|1d647958e39509cb693699fe7e7bb5dcaa	The most you can earn is an associates degree, and that takes a special 5 year high school.  To transfer, most colleges require 30 credit hours.  Considering all of the required classes that you have to take, unless you take every other class as a college level class (which still won't give you that many credit hours) you won't be able to earn a college education in your high school with out night and summer classes.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Here are three reasons why Harvard is more prestigious than SF State<br>  <br>  1. the quality of students is unsurpassed. Harvard students are literally the best and brightest. Sky high GPAs, maxed out SATs, and MANY of them have won national awards and even international awards in their extracurriculars. <br>  <br>  2. the resources available - the name Harvard is like a magic key that opens doors in every direction. If you are a Harvard student and come up with a new idea, they will give you grants to pursue it, you can get invited to any and every interesting conference and meeting and laboratory and art event in the world.  Every important person who comes to speak in the USA stops at Harvard. Compare Harvard library with UCSF library.<br>  <br>  3. the faculty are second to none. IF you buddy at UCSF was offered a place at Harvard I bet he would be gone from CA in a heartbeat.  They get top pay, they get top research prioroty for grants and materials, they get the best students in the world, and they get very tiny course loads that mean they can spend their whole lives doing pretty much exactly what they want, which nearly always involves something unique and interesting. <br>  <br>  UCSF is a good school but please dont pretend for one second that it matches up with the elite schools. That is just a fantasy.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	You really don't know what you're talking about.<br>  <br>  The astronomy dept alone employs 150 profs and researchers, and has a partnership with the Smithsonian institution.

Not to mention the difficulty some hospitals pose to getting CNMs credentialled.<br>  <br>  But what a minute.

The NC state schools are very good and they will be MUCH cheaper than going to any school in another state. The other states will charge you non-resident tuition and fees which will make those schools as expensive as if you were at a private school. <br>  <br>  You might want to get away from home, but you know, you can go to Charlotte if you are from eastern NC, or you can go to Raleigh if you are from western NC! That is further than most kids go if they went from say, New York to Boston! <br>  <br>  You need to do a lot more research about nursing and what it consists of if you do not know the name of what you want to study. Go on line and start looking for information about nursing and you will find plenty. During the beginning of your senior year of high school you can apply to the different schools you pick out and start getting your financial aid papers ready. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PXv0nBq2aa	Idk what the technical name would be but this link will take you to clooege board where i have already typed in info about wnere you want to go to school and what for and you can modify it from there:<br>  <a href="http://apps.collegeboard.com/search/servlet/advsearchservlet?buttonPressed=viewResults&navigateTo=9&viewpage=1" rel="nofollow">http://apps.collegeboard.com/search/serv...</a><br>  <br>  In that link i included private schools, in this one they are only public schools: <a href="http://apps.collegeboard.com/search/servlet/advsearchservlet?buttonPressed=viewResults&navigateTo=9&viewpage=1" rel="nofollow">http://apps.collegeboard.com/search/serv...</a><br>  <br>  You will definatly want to modify both as both have over 1,000 schools offered, b/c you said out of state I included every state except NC. <br>  <br>  Also, don't think you can't go to private school because you can't afford it. You can take out loans, and it you are very poor ( and your parents are too) you can get better financial aid going to a private school. I went to JWU(private school) in RI, do NOT go there, it was AWFUL!!!! BUT, not that i have been in community college for 2yrs I will be paying back $2,550 less than if i had stayed there. I have had to take out more private loans because my grants and federal loans have been reduced. Also, at a private school I had work study, which is a job through school and I don't gget that here. and most work study jobs pay better that working in a store while at school, also, you get to do your homework and meet all kinds of people.|`|b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	Becoming a licensed Midwife, a type of advanced practice nurse, will take about 6 years. You essentially get an MSN. . You become an RN and then go on for additional training and classes. <br>  <br>  Going out of state to a public school will cost you nearly as much as a private school<br>  <br>  Check out the American Nurses Association for additional information.   Not all universities offer all types of educational programs.   And the ANA will probably have the info you need.   Communicate with those that have actual  experience and education in the field.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	This is a pretty straightforward problem which you would have gotten a faster answer to if you put it in the chemistry section, eh?<br>  <br>  OK, the coffee is going to cool down from the ice. How much will it cool down?<br>  <br>  First you have to warm up the ice to 0 degrees so that it can start to melt. So figure how many calories it takes to warm 23 g of ice by 2.2 degrees.<br>  <br>  OK, now you have to melt 23 g of ice. So figure out how many calories it takes to do that. <br>  <br>  Those calories have to be removed from the temperature of the coffee. So you have to reduce the temp of the coffee enough to give you those calories. One degree drop of temp of the coffee gives you a callorie for each mL of coffee, right?<br>  <br>  OK, so now you have 23 g of water at 0 degrees, and 248 mL of coffee at a little less than 98 degrees. It's a little equation -  the temp of the 23 g plus the temp of the 248 mL will give the temp of the total of 271 g (or ML) <br>  <br>  Piece of cake.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	There are quite a few elite schools that have excellent programs for premed. Sometimes the university web sites brag about how well their students do. Like, at Duke something like 80+% of the premeds get into med school on their first try. But you are not going to get into one of those schools from from a community college. If you check with your counselors at the CC they can tell you what universities will allow you to transfer all your credits. So, you will probably wind up at your local good quality state university. <br>  <br>  When you get there, you immediately go to the advisor for the premed students and he/she will explain to you what the requirements are for applying to med school. You will need to take all the pre-reqs, like biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, physics with calculus and calculus. <br>  <br>  There are going to be a lot of kid who are premeds. Only a fraction of them are going to get into med school. So, you have to be totally dedicated to this dream or it isnt going to happen. You willhave to sacrifice your social life, and your time to study in order to get the top grades. If you do, you will have a fighting chance of getting into med school. But the pre req courses are hard, so be prepared for a tough time.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Wo! Way too many questions... but here's some basic info.<br>  <br>  In high school you need to take all the science and math you can get, at the highest possible level - AP calculus two years, AP chemistry and biology, AP physics. Those courses will get you ready for the tough science courses you will take in college.<br>  <br>  You will have to get a Bachelor's degree - preferably from a top college -- which means that you will have to get top marks in High School so that you can get into a top college.<br>  <br>  In college you will take chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, physics, biology, calculus (see why you have to take those courses in HS - so that you will be able to compete when you get to college!)  If you get a 3.4 or better on all your college science courses (mostly As with a few Bs) then you have a decent chance of applying to Med School and getting admitted. Med school is separate from undergrad, so if you got into Johns Hopkins as a freshman there is no guarantee that you would be accepted at the med school four years later. <br>  <br>  This is a long difficult process and only someone with brains, guts and determination can go through it. Good luck!|`|b6de075ea9eab3cc98e912ba129d6264aa	That is a lot of questions but...my friend is going to U-Penn for medical and from what SHE tells me it may be similar to John Hopkins.

Just because they messed themselves up it DOES NOT mean that your life has to be messed up.

Rule of Thumb: When in each parents home, follow the rules of the house that they have laid down for you. Then you can't go wrong. If it's something that both parents are telling you to do (and they want different things from you) you need to tell them that they need to decide jointly what they want because you do not feel comfortable following two sets of rules. Parents need to make it easier on the child, not the other way around. Depending on your age, you could talk to your school counselor, tell him/her that your folks are pulling you in two different directions and you don't know who to listen to...they could call a conference w/ your parents and maybe get it resolved that way. You seem like a very bright individual, so I hope you choose what you know is the "right" thing to do always. If you are on good terms w/ both parents and the parents are civil to one another...you could also call a family meeting and tell them your concerns over this issue yourself.

The high war reparation payments, costs of rebuilding the damaged infrastructure, and the beginning of economic depression led to hyperinflation.  People were longing for someone to get them out of their misery, and they thought at the time that Hitler was the man. Hitler was a powerful speaker who was able to exploit the economic woes of the country, the old underlying hatred of the Jewish, the resentment towards the rest of Europe, and the desire of Germans to be strong again.<br>  <br>  3) The League of Nations, unlike the United Nations, had no power to enforce any of its sanctions.  It was all talk because it had no way of backing its talk up with force.  There was really no way to stop Hitler from invading others.<br>  <br>  4) Japan had been growing rapidly in Asia for years.

También está considerado una corriente del rock alternativo, aunque el ritmo y la música del emo suelen ser más intensos y contundentes.<br>  <br>  Las bandas emo intentan no hacer música puramente comercial, ya que para ellos tratar de satisfacer a un público mayoritario con música "artificial" o "envasada", sería incompatible con expresar emociones genuinas. De hecho, tanto los conciertos de estos grupos como sus discos suelen tener precios bajos en comparación con los de otros artistas. Gran parte de los grupos de emo son contrarios a los artículos de merchandising musical, como camisetas u otros productos para ganar dinero.|`|njJfHau4aa	?QUE ES EL EMO?<br>   <br>  Mucho se ha hablado y se sigue hablando de lo que es un emo, su estética, su música, su forma de pensar, e inclusive si creen en dios y como este es un blog de cultura general tratare de aclarar algunas de estas dudas.<br>  <br>  Bueno pues es significado literal de "EMO" viene de EMOcional ,EMOciones y todo lo que tenga que ver con ellas; es poner en uso todas nuestras emociones principalmente las positivas como el amor,etc... sin embargo hay quienes afirman que es pasársela triste medio día, llorando, quejandose de la vida y tener tendencia suicida cosa totalmente alejada de la realidad.<br>  <br>  SU MUSICA<br>  La música no debe tener nada comercial así que si ustedes pensaban que MCR, Panda, fall out boy, Green Day, Good charlotte,Panic At The disco, etc, etc, eran EMO y eran los máximos exponentes pues si...lo eran, pero ahora han perdido la originalidad que muchas veces es el precio a la fama.<br>  Si quieren saber algunos nombres de bandas que ahora son las máximas exponentes del genero estas son algunas:The get up kids, Dashboard Confessional, Thursday, Silverstein, Saves The Day y Taking Back Sunday.<br>  <br>  ESTéTICA<br>  Si también creen que los emos tienen un estilo particular en la forma de vestir, pues...si están en los cierto aunque no hay que irse por los cliches<br>  ya que actualmente esta forma de vestir se ha popularizado al punto de convertirse en moda pero para las curiosos aquí les enumero algunas prendas que usan los emo aunque somo ya les dije la forma de vestir actualmente es una moda.<br>  La mayoría usa pantalones stretch, con playeras en colores como rojo, negro, azul y rosa, claro que tienen que ser también entalladas, piercing por lo regular no usan pero aqui vuelve a influir la MODA.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Yale College of Yale University is rather small. Only about 1300 students are accepted each year, while at least 18,000 - 20,000 of the best students in the USA apply. If you were an American student you would not be able to get into Yale unless you were the best student in your school - and even then it would definitely NOT be a sure thing. So, there are very few spaces for international students at the Freshman/first year undergraduate  level. You could check out Yales web site to see if they give an exact number but I would be surprised if it is more than 20 or 30 from the whole world.<br>  <br>  CIT is much smaller than Yale, so you figure that one out by yourself.  If you took the eight Ivy league universities plus say, Duke and Stanford, plus MIT, Caltech, U Chicago, and three or four more elite schools, the total number of freshmen combined would be much less than 25,000. Two million Americans, at least, will start college next fall.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	In the USA the laws vary slightly according to what state you are in. There is no universal standard.<br>  <br>  Traditionally, most states started kids in 1st grade of grammar school if they were either 5 1/2 or 6 years old at the start of the school year in Sept. So, a kid ten years old in September would probably be in 5th or 6th grade. <br>  <br>  These days many states require kids to go to kindergarten before they attend 1st grade, so they would probably start K at age 5. Many children attend nursery or even pre-nursery from age 3... <br>  <br>  US students go to elementary school until grade six, then middle school for grade 6/7/8 or 7/8 and then high school grades 9 - 12. <br>  In a few places grad 9 is in middle school. <br>  <br>  So, most American students are 18 when they graduate from HS and start college...|`|O2n3UFh7aa	It depends on when in the year your birthday falls.<br>  <br>  Some school districts are different.<br>  <br>  Plus some parents decide to keep their kids back.|`|7820b97eb7068585b0a98d0713a91ef4aa	It would probably put you in 5th Grade.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	What an interesting question! <br>  <br>  There are several schools that have programs that combine folk themes and art. Boston College has a program in Irish studies that does that. And many state universities have interdisciplinary programs where you could work out something along these lines. I think you should look at University of Arizona, U New Mexico, UNC,  and some of the California schools. Maybe one of the DC schools where there are all those museums around. <br>  <br>  One way you might research this is to go to or write or email some of the art museums that focus on traditional art. There are lots of staff members at those institutitons who are doing what you might like to do. They might have some great advice about how to get qualified.  Maybe you could get a summer internship at the Smithsonian or the Fields Museum, etc and get a handle on how to develop this interesting career notion. <br>  <br>  Good luck.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	From what my Indian students have told me, in the USA there is MUCH more direct contact between the students and Instructors. Especially in the smaller USA schools, the teachers and students often talk informally outside of class, meet for a coffee at the dining hall, or you might even be invited to a professor's home. Classes in your major subject can be small - 10 -25 students, and the students meet together to work on group projects. There are assignments that are graded on a regular basis during the course... much less of the grade is dependent on a final exam.  Of course, in the very large public universities this does not happen in the first year or two when you might have huge classes. But when you are in 3rd or 4th year and taking the advanced classes in your major, then you do have smaller classes even if the university is really huge.|`|gxTChg70aa	It's pretty hard in transferring.

ExARBYo2aa	Few careers are as potentially rewarding—or as frustrating—as that of a guidance counselor, whose job it is to help guide and structure children’s educational and vocational direction as they pass through an unstable and confusing time in their lives. It can be frustrating because you will have limited power to make students follow your advice, and often you will face students “who don’t want to think about the day after tomorrow,” as one counselor put it. A guidance counselor helps students determine courses of study and possible vocations. Counselors try to understand what motivates each student as well as his or her skills and desires. “When you’re doing things right,” wrote one, “it’s like you’re another parent, except they trust you a little more.” Individuals who aspire to enter the field should be aware that emotional as well as intellectual demands come with the territory. As most guidance counselors spend over a third of their time in consultations with students and parents, prospective counselors should be comfortable with teenagers and have excellent communication skills. Another 25 percent of a guidance counselor’s day is spent administering and evaluating tests. Guidance counselors use the results to provide context for existing records of academic performance, teacher evaluations, and a better overall understanding of students’ needs. Some guidance counselors call the continuing education they receive from the students with whom they work the most interesting feature of the profession. “I learned more from them than from any class in college,” wrote one enthusiastic counselor. “I learned more in the first day.”Not all counselors are as positive as this, but the level of satisfaction guidance counselors recorded was one of the highest of any career in this book. Of course, people who don’t love the profession usually leave quickly; guidance counselors have one of the highest initial attrition rates of any profession in this book—a staggering 60 percent within the first two years. Careers that require this degree of emotional commitment can be rough on those individuals who are not prepared to make one on a regular basis.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	In my youngest son's school the year he applied to college there were 250 kids from his school applying and the average kid applied to 10 schools. So the guidance guy had to write a personal letter of reference for every one of those kids. <br>  <br>  Besides that he had to counsel all the kids in the next class to get them ready for college apps, run the AP test registration and scheduling and the SAT scheduling for over 500 kids a year, chase the kids down to get their deposits, help kids decide about their admits, comfort the kids who got turned down, run the Honors awards ceremonies, explain financial aid to hundreds of parents who didnt understand it and be sure that everyone got all their forms submitted.... it makes me tired just thinking about how complicated and tedious his job was. <br>  <br>  I hope that when May 1st came and the decisions were made, that he had time to relax a little. He definitely deserved it. By the way, he did a fabulous job and the school sent dozens of kids on to the top schools every year, as well as finding appropriate schools for all the lower ranked kids who wanted to go to college. Good job, Mr T.!

KV4rPOoZaa	Whoa whoa, too many questions scattered. Breathe! <br>  First, you don't want to ever be a limited x ray tech! The only ones who will have advantage of this are the greedy small clinic doctors and the chiropracters who hire you and of course the school who scammed you for MONEY. Of course, you are going to spend more money than you should and waste time and opportunity. Just like drugs, say no to them!<br>  Whatever you call it, we are the radiographers, x ray techs, radiological technologist or simply x ray technologist again who are technologists who have formal education in order to perform diagnostic exams by the application of xrays while protecting oneself and the patient for the radiiologist to diagnose. You can take this occupation and learn it by a hospital based program, a community college or a 4 year university. What classes? It depends on your program but universally it is anatomy & physiology 1 & 2, physics, chemistry and algebra. After you complete and become registered in radiography or x ray, you are able to market yourself by learning other modalities such as MRI, CAT SCAN, radiation therapy, nuclear medicine, bone density (so easy) or fusion imaging (dual licensed techs). A radiation therapist admisters high doses of radiation to cancer cells or tumors in order to exterminate them while giving the patient's body time to heal itself also under the guidance and utilage of a medical dosimetrist and oncologist. How do you become one? You can go through a hospital based program, a community college, a university or a one year or a half certificate program especially if you are an x ray tech. It also depends on the program on what classes you need to take. The program in my former school had the students complete a series of preequisites such as speech, Anatomy & physiology 1 & 2, precalculus, statistics 1 & 2, computer class, chemistry and physics. If you do want to become a radiation therapist, it is strongly RECOMMENDED THAT YOU DO NOT DO THIS FOR THE MONEY AT ALL SINCE YOU ARE DEALING WITH REALLY SICK PEOPLE WHO MAY DIE DUE TO THEIR ILLNESS. You need to show empathy to these patients. This is the only field where you should not do this for the money. Honeslty, it is harder than being employed as a nurse because you are the one who is administering the medication to treat these immunocompromised patients and as well having the knowledge what are the side effects of the treatment. Anyway, good luck.

He comes from a middle class family in a semi-rural community.  He stuck with his original plans/goals.  He worked summers and weekends the first two years of med school and all through undergrad to earn money.  <br>  <br>  Financial aid is available to med students...there is some aid that ALL students qualify for.  You can take the max in loans each year and that will even give you some money for rent and food (get a roommate and live frugally!)  during med school.  Med school loans don't have to be repaid until after you finish residency (or 3 yrs out of med school...but you can file for extensions if you are still doing residency at this point)  so you don't have to worry about them right away while earning a resident's salary.  <br>  <br>  It's scary how much debt my husband accumulated, but I try not to think much about it since we aren't in repayment right now and we can still get a house or car loan as needed.

I was working part to full time (not the greatest pay) and he worked weekends and one night a week the first two yrs.

Plus you have the rest of high school to change your mind and you can change your major in college.  Don't let money deter you.  But getting into med school is really hard.  Not to discourage you, but people applying to med school are cream of the crop, a 3.67 won't get you noticed when you apply for med school.  Start developing those good study habits now.  Plus it will pay off in scholarships in your under-grad program.  If it turns out to be to much try nursing or radiology or another career in the medical field.  They are also excellent.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	GWU is a well respected university that is, like Georgetown, a middle of the road institution that tends to attract a lot of politically active students of all types, due to its location in D.C.  A student who was ideologically political rather than pragmatically political would be better off at Liberty University or Oral Roberts. A grad student at GWU would be in constant dialogue about public issues. He wouldnt be able to hide in a closet and complain about the Democrats being traitors. <br>  <br>  GWU is located in downtown Washington, literally blocks from the Whitehouse and Capitol. It is an urban landscape, but not a bad one. And the National mall and lots of greenspace exists along the river and in the various parks.

And of course, if you are going to major in performance music you will have to do an audition, but if you are a dedicated musician you will be OK. <br>  <br>  I have two young friends who are at Berklee now and they TOTALLY love it. I saw one of them at a jam session recently when he came home from spring semester and he said he had been playing in 8 different music groups from 6 to 10 hours a day - all different genres of music from folk to celtic to asian to African drumming to metal rock to classical. His playing has taken a quantum leap upwards since he went to school last fall. <br>  <br>  This is ONLY a place for people obsessed with playing music - but if that's you, go for it!!!

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	You can get authoritative information about medical school applications by viewing the website of the Association of American Medical Colleges. <br>  <br>  They list the number of applicants from different schools and what they majored in. <br>  <br>  If you have high grades in organic chem, physics, and bio then that will obviously count for more than high grades in sociology or history.  But 3.4 is not a very high average in this competitive area unless you are from some notoriously tough school like UChicago or MIT. You need to focus on getting that GPA up and getting a really good MCAT score to validate your skills.|`|50203cbdb1034e3185f96c0580ea3065aa	Hi there,<br>  I don't think you will catch many people applying "at the last minute" to medical school. One of the reasons is that little obstacle called the MCAT. Unless you prep for the MCAT, there is no way to do well enough on it to get into medical school. Second, those English majors would have to take the pre-med curriculum as well.<br>  <br>  Anyways, you need to raise your GPA (even though its fine) instead of doing all the extracurriculars. The average accepted med school GPA is 3.46. I'm not saying to not do extracurriculars, but you should be selective about them. Pick things that directly relate to medicine. This isn't like applying to colleges where it is "the more extracurriculars, the better." Not at all. Physician shadowing, volunteering, etc are all good uses of your time. <br>  <br>  Now back to your GPA, while I said it is fine (and it is), you are in your freshman year of college. When I was a freshman in college, my GPA never dipped below a 3.9. It's important to do REALLY well your first couple of years, because the course work will get harder, and your time will be stretched even thinner. So take advantage of the "easier" classes while you can.<br>  <br>  As for the double major or no double major, it really doesn't matter. All they care about is how well you do in whatever you select. And it matters how you do in your pre-med classes.<br>  <br>  Based soley on your GPA, I would say that unless you do amazing on the MCAT--11's on each section, it's not looking too good. I'm just being realistic. Yes, the average accepted GPA is 3.46 and you are awfully close...you need to bring it up to at least a 3.5 to be competitve. It also depends where you want to go...you could get into a not-as-competitive school, but I think it would be hard for you to get into a super competitive one. Good luck!|`|1d7a07d01f7d2bc2614fda1e9ec034a4aa	i have attended MANY med school conventions and they all say the same thing. med school admissions boards look for diversity.they want well rounded students. they will take a B+ student over an A student if the B+ student has awesome extracurriculars. do you realize how many bio majors apply to med school each year? Non-science majors HAVE to complete most/all prereqs before they can even apply, this is the same for science majors. non-science majors have to go that extra mile to get into the game, which is why admissions boards favor them. non-science majors have to know before they start college that they want to be pre-med. it would be VERY hard for someone to suddenly wake up and wanna be a doctor. thats why there are prereqs. but regardless of all your academic preperation, med students are all the same. they equally struggle. doesn't matter if you have a PHD or a BA, in Philosophy or Chemistry. if chem and math is also your passion go for it

Especially if you like rock n roll, American football or basketball. And if you are respectful to women.

So, you put some of your own energy into getting what you want by thinking about it. That is the basic principle of magick, the next step is to focus that energy into a finer stream, say by using candles and incense and symbols, you are telling your subconscious mind what you want, so then you have both parts of you mind putting forth energy for the exact same goal, only the subconscious mind is stronger because it doesn't have to deal with all the crap your conscious mind goes threw. So you send this refined energy out into the universe, it recieves this energy and starts to put forth what it is that you asked for. Depending on how big the thing you wished for was determines how long it will take.

AA10926886	Med school admissions committees are not looking for applicants with certain majors, or for applicants who USE a particular major to help them get into med school.

AA11514184	ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS<br>  <br>  The UCLA Department of Film, Television, and Digital Media admits new students once each year in the Fall Quarter. Applications must be filed one year in advance; no late applications are accepted. As the number of qualified applicants far exceeds the number who can be accepted, students are encouraged to have alternate plans in the event they are not admitted.<br>  <br>  The UC Application for Undergraduate Admission and Scholarships is available beginning in September. Applicants should apply on-line or download and print a paper application at www.ucop.edu/pathways. The university no longer mails out paper applications except in rare circumstances. California residents may obtain a paper application at any UC campus admissions office or from the counseling office of any California high school or community college.<br>  <br>  Detailed instructions and the forms for submitting the additional required supporting materials to the department can be downloaded and printed at www.tft.ucla.edu.<br>  <br>  Normally, the University does not accept transfer applicants who will have more than 80 semester or 120 quarter units at the time of entrance. Unfortunately, students not admitted to the Film and Television major cannot be guaranteed admission to UCLA in their second choice of major.<br>  <br>  Admission is at the junior level only. Applicants must have at least a 3.0 GPA at the time of application and by the time of entrance must:<br>  <br>  1) Satisfy the University of California's general transfer admission requirements<br>  2) Complete a minimum of 60 semester / 90 quarter transferable units<br>  3) Complete the General Education (GE) requirements of the UCLA School of Theater, Film, and Television, or the GE requirements while a student at another UC Campus, or the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) at a California community college<br>  <br>  Applicants should also attempt to complete the Preparation for the Major courses (American film history, European film history, American television history, one theater course), although this is not an admission requirement. <br>  <br>  The School's Additional Degree Requirements for the B.A. degree, consisting of foreign language proficiency and three literature courses, do not have to be completed prior to entry. California community college students should note that these Additional Degree Requirements are not satisfied by completion of the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC). <br>  <br>  All applicants must submit their application supporting materials directly to the department:<br>  <br>  <br>  1) A departmental questionnaire<br>  2) Unofficial college transcripts<br>  <br>  3) Two letters of recommendation<br>  <br>  4) A personal essay - a summary of the student's background, creative interests, academic and professional goals (2 pages)<br>  5) A critical essay on a film or television program (3 pages)<br>  6) A creative writing sample - a short story, play, script, poetry, or any combination (5 pages)<br>  <br>  <br>  The lengths indicated are maximum. Finalists may be invited for an interview. Films and videotapes are not accepted, nor is prior experience required. The Department seeks undergraduate applicants with a strong liberal arts background, good imagination, and excellent communication skills.<br>  <br>  The filing/postmark deadline for the UC undergraduate application is November 30. The deadline for receipt of the supporting materials in the Department of Film, Television, and Digital Media is the last Friday in January.<br>  <br>  Current UCLA students wishing to enter the Film and Television major may only apply during the first four weeks of spring quarter of the sophomore year; application information is available in the School's Student Services Office in 103 East Melnitz.

And it is discriminatory in the sense that all college admissions are discriminatory. That is, it is the job of the admissions committee to discriminate among all the candidates - which ones shall be admitted? <br>  <br>  You are suggesting that there is some way to decide which students should be admitted that would be more fair? What would that be? GPA? But everyone knows that some high schools are tougher than others. What about SATs? There have been numerous comments on Yahoo about how unfair that is! <br>  The schools have to decide based on many factors. And especially in private schools it is not correct to assume that the purpose of the school is to find applicants who have the highest academic credentials without regard for anything else. <br>  Admissions have to consider academics, and also, what students will fit in best on the campus, who will be comfortable, who will take advantage of the opportunities, who will contribute to the campus life. Who will be accepted, and then will actually show up for classes in September!<br>  A big advantage of legacies is that when you have a legacy applicant , that person actually knows something about your school. They are applying because they actually think your school is the right one, not just because they are randomly shotgunning applications or because they heard from someone that it was a good school. And when legacies are accepted, they almost always matriculate - they actually come to the school. <br>  <br>  So, legacies are a good deal for the school. And, given two candidates who are equal in their qualifications, most schools would accept a legacy over an equally well qualified non-legacy.<br>  However, schools prosper when they get good students, so most schools would not sacrifice quality to get a legacy. If two students are not equal, then being a legacy will not get you admitted over someone who is clearly a better match for the school. <br>  <br>  I interviewed many, many applicants for an elite school I attended. Many were legacies and were not accepted. But the parents who attended the school years ago were mostly very smart and successful, so their kids were mostly very smart and well prepared for college, and they really knew what that school was all about, so a lot of them got in. <br>  <br>  ps you are just fooling yourself if you think that admissions to elite schools around the world are not based on networking and connections -- please don't tell me that Oxbridge is an open admissions process!!!!  And in many countries around the world, admission to elite schools is based almost totally on family connections and networking. If you think otherwise then you are simply don't know what you are talking about. <br>  <br>  What is the point of posting a question if all you want is for people to pat you on the shoulder and tlel you how smart you are and how much they agree with you. THat kind of thinking will not get you very far if you imagine that you are a candidate for an elite school.<br>  <br>  ps. Thanks for reminding me how France is a classless society that treats all its immigrants with dignity and where everyone, no matter their race or ethnic origin (especially Protestants, Jews, Africans and Arabs)  has a full share in the riches of the country without discrimination.  If only we could all be si parfait!|`|EmQ50DFVaa	I suspect that, at this point, "legacy" preference is largely a fund raising tool. Alumni may feel that they are enhancing their descendants' chances  by maintaining ties (i.e. donating) to their Alma Mater. Universities like to keep the flow of old money flowing across the generations.  As private universities in the U.S. may not be as well subsidized by the government as might be comparable institutions in other countries, they are greatly dependent on such "development" efforts.  So, while not an egalitarian practice, this may nonetheless be a pragmatic policy.

Geometry is more the comprehension of shapes and measurements of specific angles....not a LOT of Algebra...so dont sweat it<br>  <br>  (it was just hard for me since A. My teacher sucked and B. I never had a knack for angle measurements lol)<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie, u can do it!! =)

That is good. <br>  <br>  For starters, there are at least 14 spelling errors in this paragraph, plus grammar errors. Both Northwestern and UChicago are elite schools where they expect really good English language skills. So, unless you work on your English, I think you will not be able to gain admission at those schools or the other elite schools... And here's another point - being a physician means being someone who tends to details. Would you want a physician who didn't notice details or thought they weren't important? That would be bad! Right now, your attention to details shows in your spelling. You can improve it if you decide to do so. <br>  <br>  To become a physician you will need to take many of the toughest courses in college - especially chemistry and math. So, it will be really important for you to do well in chem, honors chem and preferably AP chem. And take math through calculus, preferably the 2 AP calc courses. These classes will really help you do better in the college courses that are the foundation for the MCAT tests. <br>  <br>  If you can get your English skills under control, then I think you have a chance to get into a top 25 school.|`|B5GfkjFKaa	What do your SAT's look like?
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Do you mean, what is the number of students enrolled at the  universities?  This varies from a few hundred students at some small private colleges to 50,000 or more students at the largest public universities. Most of the famous elite private schools are rather small - Duke, Stanford, the Ivies, etc have only about 6000-7000 undergraduates each.<br>  <br>  You can get statistics about all the 3,800 colleges in the USA at sites like collegeboard.com or princetonreview.com or US News.

And so he was, and God saw that it would lead to years of entertainment for him, and years of strife for us. So who is to say the Bible is right and science is wrong? Or vice versa? If you look at how the bible says the story of the creation of the earth, and Darwins theory of evolution, they go hand in hand. Example! "God said let their be light, and there was. And the light was serparted by the dark." Guess what ELSE makes light...the big bang theory...same story, just instead of one group beliving it happened because God was bored, another thinks it happened due to gas and whatever else is out there in space."<br>  <br>  Not sure what your GOAL in your essay is, but that might be a good start if you are looking at BOTH veiws equally.

Some colleges promise to make up the difference in grants and loans, but not all schools are rich enough to do that. <br>  <br>  If USC doesnt want to pay up there is no way for you to force them to give you more money. You will have to choose a different school.|`|ZX1AOUHvaa	Have you called the financial aid department at USC to find out?|`|i51RdlVNaa	You have to get another loan from an independent loan company...the loan company differs from state to state.

I guess I am not understanding what you are asking because EFC (Expected Family Contribution) is only $3,600 while the cost of attendance is $25,000. That means your financial aid covered a large portion of the cost? When I went to college, I always received enough for tuition and housing. The financial aid award usually looked like this: cost of attendance - $16,000, Expected Family Contribution  (EFC) - $2,500, Financial Aid Elibility $13,500. From the financial aid section, I was awarded enough grants and federal loans to cover the cost of attendance (which covers fees, books & supplies, room & board, personal expenses, and tuition). Even though it said EFC is $2,500, my parents did not have to put in a single penny for my education.

66da597893d7b1d350884f2a7ae54441aa	Since you asked for a former/current student or faculty member, I thought I'd respond (being a student).  <br>  <br>  Quite a few people visit the school but they often get a limited persepective or are somewhat confused as to the structure (although visits are still very good).  There's so much to say and yet I have essays that need to get written...<br>  <br>  (Obviously, given the length of this answer, I have my priorities wrong.)<br>  <br>  =)<br>  <br>  Before I mention anything else, about 2/3 of the students transfer out to other universities by the end of their sophomore year (it's just how things go, I'm going to be one of them).  They almost always enter their transfer school as a junior.  I also assume you already know that it usually accepts people starting at the age of 15 (average freshman enters after sophomore or junior year of high school).<br>  <br>  This is also NOT Bard College (you probably already know this but some other people might get confused).  While Simon's Rock has financial associations with Bard (and there's a very simple transfer process into Bard), the two schools are barely related in terms of faculty and administration (the schools share just two of the same officers).<br>  <br>  In particular regards to the science program, its strongest areas are physics and environmental science although biology, chemistry, and computer science (more engineering, but...) still have some amazing faculty members.  A lot of people transfer out to good sciency schools after two years OR, if you stay for three years at Simon's Rock, you can go to Columbia University, Dartmouth, or Washington University in St. Louis for two years and get a BA from Simon's Rock and a BS from one of the aforementioned universities (five years total, two Bachelor's degrees).  It's called the "3/2 Engineering Program" (although most sciences are included) and almost everyone chooses Columbia.  This year, 100% (four) of the juniors who took the 3/2 route were "accepted" at Columbia (acceptance is a formality as long as you've completed required courses and maintained a 3.0+, B, GPA).<br>  <br>  If you like Apple computers, you will have lots of company.  For the people like me, you can gloat that your Windows machine runs all those new video games and programs perfectly (sorry, I had to throw this in).<br>  <br>  The science people, by the way, are more sane than the artsy people.  I usually like the science people better.<br>  <br>  As a whole, Simon's Rock is a really, really liberal school which is to be expected of a primarily liberal arts school.  If you cannot stand the thought of living in the boonies, you will be in for a rude awakening.  The town of Great Barrington is nice but it's pretty small and quiet.  The campus is set on a little over 200 acres, most of it undeveloped, and usually has about 350 students on campus at any given time (with about 50 studying abroad).<br>  <br>  The faculty are the single greatest aspect of Simon's Rock (this is this hardest part to gauge from visiting).  Almost all of the professors hold terminal degrees in their fields and are willing to take time out of their personal lives to help students through problems (both academic and not-so-academic personal issues).  Classes average about 9-11 students with a few introductory science courses reaching 20 people while a number of classes have less than 5 people.<br>  <br>  Students are usually bright although some of them are a little arrogant and conceited.  You should make some really close friends, though.  You also get to live with a roommate you first (and probably second) year.  I've had one awesome roommate and one rather strange (i.e. bad) roommate.  Either way, roommates are "fun."<br>  <br>  As transfer student, we've been accepted into almost any college/university you can think of.  Everything from Julliard to Stanford and all the state schools inbetween.  Ditto for graduate and professional schools (whether you transfere or stay for all four years).  You can contact the Admissions people for a much more complete list.<br>  <br>  This is a real college.  Not just in terms of accreditation but in the sense you're given the freedom do what you like (no curfews, mandatory study halls, etc.) as any other "normal" college.  While people are usually willing to help you through tough times, nobody's going to track you down at 10:50 to make you show up at your 11:00 class.<br>  <br>  Simon's Rock is sadly, also uber-expensive, something like $50,000 comprehensive for each year.  The cafeteria food definitely isn't worth the price but they force you to buy ia full meal plan during your first year.  If I were you, I'd apply to the Acceleration to Excellence Program Scholarship (AEP) as you can get a full-tuition merit scholarship good for your first two years (I'm on this scholarship).<br>  <br>  And that's the short summary.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	My son was quite interested in this school but as soon as we visited and took a look he totally changed his mind. You need to visit. That's pretty true of just about any school, but I think it is particularly true of this one. <br>  <br>  Maybe it will be just your thing, but you definitely need to check it out in person.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The salaries for professors in American universities are quite modest by American standards. At most schools you need a PhD to become a permanent, full-time professor. When you are a full professor (after about 10 -12 years) you would make an average of about $75,000. That is more than most people make, but much less than successful businessmen, doctors, lawyers or engineers make.  <br>  <br>  School teachers in most of the US make less than $50,000 a year, although in some elite, rich school districts some teachers can make quite a bit more. <br>  <br>  If you need to get more detailed information about professors, there is an annual survey printed in the Chronicles of Higher Education. It gives very detailed accounts of salaries for different ranks of professors in different subject areas at various types of colleges.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	I am confused by your question. These are very famous colleges for women which are near each other in Massachusetts. They are primarily liberal arts colleges although they do have some science majors, so surely some of their grads go on to careers in science and to medical school... But most of their graduates do not go work in hospitals. You should not have any problem googling them.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	You are not a slave or a criminal, so you can't be forced to attend. However, you probably paid a down payment and you will not get that money back. Also, you will lose any scholarship money you were offered and if you change your mind again it will be gone.  If you were accepted by a different school then that acceptance is probably cancelled by now, so you are out of luck in both directions. <br>  <br>  Still, it is better to lose a down payment rather than spend many months and many thousands of dollars doing something you dont like.  You can always apply to other schools for admission in January or for next September.  But I wouldnt count on applying to this school again after you screwed them by withdrawing.<br>  <br>  You might consider this - if you sort of want to go there but you are just not sure, and maybe you want to take some time off to think it over? OK, then call or write them and ask if you can defer attending for a term or a year. Then they will just postpone your acceptance and you will be able to come to school later probably with the same financial package that you have now. And if you defer and then decide that you want to withdraw, you can do so later.  That might be the best choice.... You did like this school enough to apply and accept them... so give yourself some time to think it over.|`|9WdXE54aaa	YES YES YES|`|9f57858f9b889365a029fdaabb8da0f0aa	There are always many other students on the waiting list.

All that matters is that you're happy going where you want to go.

Most of the schools that you have heard of are regionally accredited, but when you need to check, you can always call up their admissions office and ask. "Are you regionally accredited" and they will tell you. OR, in nearly all cases if you check their website it will say somewhere on there that they are accredited by the Western or Southern or Northeastern regional accreditation guys. <br>  <br>  All the state colleges and universities are regionally accredited.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Dear A.<br>  <br>  In the USA many of the most respected schools were founded or funded  by religious groups or clergymen.

And numerous famous small colleges such as Wesleyan, Amherst, Middlebury, Trinity, Guilford, Haverford, etc.<br>  <br>  In the USA the older religious colleges were so obviously useful and productive that as the country expanded it became a law (The Land Grant College Law) that each new state must create a college. So in the western USA there are fewer religious colleges, but in general (and with many exceptions) the non-religious schools are not regarded as being as prestigious as the older eastern private schools such as the Ivies. <br>  <br>  I would say that in the USA education and religion have been very good partners.|`|AA10743319	What is your egucation?|`|8219ddd2d8f0b1bb31d825bd05757ca9aa	egucation is not a word.

They might suggest that you take some more physics or other science/math coursework this year for admission into their program(s).<br>  <br>  Keep going, and good luck this year!|`|bb3lH4Z4aa	you should by far...but if not...dont declar a major till you are already accepted...that way they know you are by far good enough for thier school, your just like every other hs student going to college...not sure......but you should be good for UCLA and the Cal schools
VR18BwPNaa	I had the same troubles deciding on a school before college. I'm going into my senior year at the University of Iowa, then planning on Stanford for grad school. I'm going through the process all over again.  Anyway...<br>   <br>  All the schools you've decided to apply to are great. From my experience its best to narrow down, say your top four schools, then visit them. Can you see yourself among the students, in the cafeteria, the classes, the dorms and is it somewhere you feel comfortable? I think personal one-on-one visits are best because they hook you up with a current student and they can answer all your questions instead of being in a big group. <br>  <br>  Meet with a professor in your major, if you know what it's going to be. <br>  <br>  If you're planning to keep up the same extra activities in college you might ask about each of those things or set up meetings with the leadership/coaches of that activity to see if you like it. <br>  <br>  Most schools have application fees so you should make sure you know how much those are, and when they're due before you apply. <br>  <br>  I went to a two year school before transferring. That decision is really up to you based on how far from home you want to go, if you feel ready for a four year school, that sort of thing. Which is really a question only you can answer. It might sound corny, but put schools out of your mind and think about what you want out of college, out of your degree, and further in the future. Then pick the school that will best help you get there.<br>  <br>  Two year schools generally have smaller class sizes than the bigger universities and you get more personal attention from the professors. They come big and small, so you can find one that's the right fit. A lot of JC's have agreements with the universities so that you can get an Associates degree and transfer all or most of the credits to the university. This is nice because then you can just focus on your major during your last two years.<br>  <br>  You seem like you're well-rounded activities wise with solid grades so I wish you luck. Stanford, Harvard and Princeton are really, really competitive and I don't want to discourage you from trying but I'd suggest cautious optimism. I'd really recommend talking to your guidance counselor--they are a huge help when it comes to applications and essays.  You've got good stats, be confident in it and things tend to have a way of working out for the best.<br>  <br>  Just make sure that, whether its a 2 year or 4 year school you're comfortable with all aspect of the school because it will be your home for as long as your there.<br>  <br>  I've put a couple of links below that helped me narrow my school choices.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Unless your school is a very famous one that has sent a lot of kids on to successful careers at top colleges, I dont think your GPA will qualify you for Harvard, Princeton or Stanford. So,those three are definitely very long shots.<br>  <br>  <br>  What are you looking for in a school? A person who would be happy at Harvard or Stanford could never be happy at a JC. They are totally different kinds of places.  For instance, Harvard has only about 1200 Freshman.  When you go there every other kid you meet is a top student, very motivated and hard working. The students come from all over the world and have made it through a daunting selection process - at Harvard and the other elite colleges they are training people to be the next generation of world leaders. Why are you applying there if you think that you would be happy at a JC?  <br>  <br>  Sometimes some pretty good students go to JC, but mostly not. Most of the JC students are kids who werent dedicated enough or smart enough to get really good grades in High school.  They mostly are not going to be the movers and shakers of the 21st Century. <br>  <br>  You definitely need to think more about what your life plan is. If you are ambitious, then you need to be at the best college you can get into.... Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Duke, UChicago, UC Berkeley etc are ranked high because they provide a world class education to motivated students. If you are not ready for that, then you can get a good education at one of the UC campuses. If your ambition is to be a Jr High School science teacher in your home town - and there's nothing the matter with that - then you will be fine at any of the Cal State universities.|`|cae2a17c25e7a1c76d057e7937dd807caa	First, all of the UC and CSU schools do not require you to declare a major until your Junior year.  I am not sure how Harvard and Princeton handle major declaration.<br>  <br>  You will have to deicde if you are ready to go to a large campus, and if you are ready to commit to your education enough to resist the temptations that University life brings.<br>  <br>  I assume that you live in California, judging your choices of schools.  Most California Community Colleges are wonderful.  I attended Santa Rosa Junior College for a year, and it was an awesome experience.  Unfortunately, I had to drop because of medical reasons, so my experience there was brief.<br>  <br>  Junior Colleges are much less money, and sometimes not as difficult as 4 year schools.  With a Biology major, though, you can choose any college you want and it will be difficult.<br>  <br>  With your qualifications, you will get into most of the UC and CSU schools.  Stanford, Harvard, and Princeton are much more competitive so don't be heartbroken if you don't get in.  It is nothing against you as a student.

Schools have to make money to stay open, attract better faculty and high quality research, etc... On the other hand, you're getting something out of it, too. That being a degree and training which will allow you to excell in your chosen career path. For example, going to Harvard will cost you quite a bit. But when you're done, you'll have one of the best educations on the planet and employers will be beating down your door ready to offer you just about anything you ask.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The American higher educational system is imitated and admired around the world. That's why we have over 500,000 international students studying in the USA this second. <br>  <br>  There are over 3800 colleges. Some of them are probably pretty awful, but a lot of them are really great and do a terrific job of turning out young people who are ambitious, creative and self-confident. <br>  <br>  I get tired of hearing people whine about how bad things are. The kids I have taught over the last 40 years have been just great and many of them are having wonderful careers.  I would, and in fact do, trust my former students to give me financial advice, act as my accountant, physician and contractor. They all do a great job. The proof of the educational system is in the pudding - how well are my former students doing in the wide world...<br>  <br>  Stop whining and get down to business and you will find that the colleges will give you the training and education you need to succeed.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	No, that's just wishful thinking on the part of some 8th grade boys.... no such place.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Lots of schools use TA's. That could be a bad thing, but not necessarily....<br>  <br>  Let's say you are at Duke and you have a TA... then she is probably a graduate of one of the best colleges in the US. She probably has a MA or MS from Duke and is probably working on cutting edge research in some completely uptodate field in a ultra modern laboratory. She probably got chosen from 100 applicants to be admitted to Duke's grad school. She probably is way excited about her studies and  can't wait to have a chance to pass on the stuff she has just learned. She will probably stay after school and spend lots of extra time with students  because she is so excited about what she's doing.... in other words, shw could be as good as it gets for a teacher!<br>  <br>  Or, you could go to some school that advertises that it doesnt use TAs to teach - then you get some burned out old guy who hasnt done any research in 20 years and can hardly stand to drag himself into class.  He's tenured so he doesn give a s**t what you think about him, and nothing you say can be of interest to him. <br>  <br>  So, TAs are not necessarily a bad thing at all!|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Yes, they all do.  Pretty much all colleges do.  That doesn't mean teaching assistants will be teaching your courses - most schools don't really do that.  TAs will teach lab sections and lead discussion sections, as well as help sessions and they will grade your homework and often exams.  I know this is true in the sciences, it might be slightly different in the humanities.|`|6b992d40e593b6d718fc687f2a684453aa	Most schools use TAs.<br>  <br>  They'll lead lab sections in science classes, and they'll lead study sessions and grade homework in other classes.  This allows the professors to spend their time doing research.|`|J36arjZeaa	All of those schools use TAs.  That's because those are all research universities, and the TAs are being paid a pittance to do some teaching job so that they can work on their thesis research and live on rice and beans without having to take a part-time job at Home Depot.<br>  <br>  The question is HOW the different institutions use TAs.  In biology, for example, it would be typical for professors to teach the actual lecture classes, but TAs might lead the lab sections.  In the humanities ... not sure how it would work there, but humanities departments usually have fewer TAs because they don't have labs to teach.  TAs might lead discussion sections or grade papers I guess.

One that gladdeneth his heart all the day provideth not for his house. The bowman hitteth the mark, as the steersman reacheth land, by diversity of aim.' The more familiar modern saying appeared first in James Howell's 'Proverbs in English, Italian, French and Spanish' (1659), and was included in later collections of proverbs. Some writers have added a second part to the proverb, as in 'Harry and Lucy Concluded' (1825) by the Irish novelist Maria Edgeworth: 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy/ All play and no work makes Jack a mere toy'."

(Acolytes are basically altar boys/girls.)  Since most acolytes are starting in about 5th grade, and I had been doing it for eight years, I was in a great position to train the newcomers.  It didn't really take a lot of extra work, but it was still an example of leadership experience to some extent.  There is no reason not to include stuff like that on your application.|`|6b128320b86b5734a08fa6333711742faa	well it could be considered as  an extracurricular activity, if you are doing something productive.

In addition they have very high educational standards, technology standards, infrastructures, and sophisticated healthcare, public health and environmental standards. <br>  <br>  Yogi suggested that you check the CIA World Factbook. but I think you need to read a few books about the difference between the 1st world and 3rd world.

They don't have petroleum or some really importan source of wealth such as an important production of gold or silver.|`|zknBamvPaa	What's the point of labeling countries in that way anyway?<br>  <br>  Does it really make a difference if you call, say Australia a "1st world" country or not?  What does that have to do with reality.<br>  <br>  What exactly are you looking for?<br>  <br>  Most people in the world understand that Canada is a wealthy country irrespective of what industries exist, and to say something as broad as "those countries don't have important industries..."  is untrue.  Canada is a pioneer in communications and provided a lot of the skill to NASA to send man to the moon.  You might be still changing your clock for every city that you visit if it weren't for a Canadian inventing the concept of time zones.  Before that it didn't matter what time zone you lived in.  Most cities had there own time, and it wasn't so neatly divided into hours.  More like one city would be 43 minutes different from another.  And that's nothing.  What about Alexander Graham Bell?  You wouldn't even have a phone if it wasn't for him coming up with ideas in Canada.<br>  <br>  Canada doesn't have petroleum, gold, or silver?  You need to do some studying.  Canada also provides the U.S. with the majority of it's oil, in case you didn't know.<br>  <br>  But, seriously, what's the point of your question?<br>  <br>  As long as people live peacefully, that's all that matters.  And each country you mentioned lives a lot more peacefully than the U.S., or even the U.K. for that matter.<br>  <br>  I have an idea:  Go to a library and read through a few encyclopedias.  Most places in the world have public libraries.  Usually it's a building that has a lot of books on shelves.  You can enter the building, and read books for free.  Usually they allow people to take books home for a period of a couple of weeks or so, but you have to promise to return the books.  This is also a free service.

Also frog is in the water and dinosaur on land, and whale is in the water and dnake on land.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, it could be mouse because frog and dinosaur are both coldblooded and whale and mouse are also both warmblooded.  And of course they are both mammals.<br>  <br>  On the third hand, birds are also warmblooded. So frogs and dinosaurs use mainly their hind limbs to move, but whales and birds use mainly their forelimbs to move (fins and wings)<br>  <br>  So I would say that you could argue for some points no matter which one you put!|`|671ff7a12031f46077aad7f07a96e29faa	I haven't a clue...but why does everyone think it's the mouse???

The SAT or ACT is definitely secondary. <br>  <br>  What do you mean by "good college" There are 2000 colleges in the USA. The top 20 or so are extremely competitive, but the rest are not very competitive. Look at the acceptance rates for lots of the colleges in the top 100 US News rankings and you will find lots of them that accept over 50% of applicants. <br>  <br>  If you have an average of 650 or so on your college board tests, and a GPA of 3.5 or so, you can get into any but the most selective schools. You should be thinking about WHICH school is going to fit you better. City or country? Big or small? North, South, East or West? Public or private? There is a lot of info about this at your local library and online. You can check every school you're interested in and see the stats for their last class....

818d81a0b9c2df8efff25e31925a4349aa	I am a biology major, which is under the school of natural sciences here at my university.  There are other majors that are considered natural sciences.  for example, chemistry, zoology, marine biology, geology, ecology, astronomy etc.  However, not many schools offer all of these.  The most popular are biology, chemistry, and marine biology.  Those who major in bio and chem look foward to med  schools, dental schools, pharmacy schools etc.  If you're interested in these subjects, then go for it.  But majoring in a science field takes a lot of dedication, time, studying, hw, and a sudden decrease of a social life.  but good luck deciding!|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	In one of my kid's schools they had that major. It was strictly for premed and predental students. They didnt major in a single science, but took two or three courses in each of several different sciences. That gave them a good preparation and met all the requirements for the medical schools apps. but they didnt have to do a lot of stuff that was very advanced and not related to the med school classes. <br>  <br>  So, it wasnt an easy major because all the kids in there were hot shot students. You need to talk to the advisor for that program before you commit to it.

Es el mismo camino que en 1989 recorrió Rodolfo Coria, por aquel entonces investigador del Museo de Ciencias Naturales Bernardino Rivadavia, de la ciudad de Buenos Aires. <br>  <br>  Ese a?o, Coria fue tentado por una propuesta más que interesante para un paleontólogo recién recibido: estudiar los restos del Argentinosaurus huinculensis, el dinosaurio más grande del mundo, cuyos huesos habían sido desenterrados días antes. Claro que implicaba un desafío: dejar todo e irse a vivir allí junto a su mujer y su peque?a hija. <br>  <br>  A catorce a?os de su llegada a esta ciudad, de 20.000 habitantes, Coria es el director del Museo Carmen Funes, donde ayer se inauguró una muestra cuya vedette es una réplica en tama?o real del Argentinosaurus, única en el hemisferio sur, de 38 metros de largo por ocho de alto. Para quienes gustan de las comparaciones, basta con decir que cada una de sus vértebras es del tama?o de un lavarropas. <br>  <br>  En la ceremonia de ayer por la tarde, fueron inauguradas las nuevas instalaciones del museo, que sumó dos nuevas salas: la que alberga al Argentinosaurus, junto a réplicas en tama?o real del Giganotosaurus carolinii (que con sus 12 metros de largo y cuatro de alto es el dinosaurio carnívoro más grande del mundo, superior en tama?o al famoso Tyrannosaurus rex) y de otros dinosaurios patagónicos, y una segunda dedicada a la historia local del petróleo. <br>  <br>  El Museo Carmen Funes cuenta ahora con una superficie de 2500 metros cuadrados que alberga una de las colecciones de dinosaurios patagónicos más grandes del mundo, con aproximadamente 600 ejemplares clasificados. Algunos son únicos y poseen inmenso valor científico, como los restos del Gasparinisaura, del Anabisetia, del Aucasaurus o los del propio Argentinosaurus. <br>  <br>  Justamente, otra de las nuevas instalaciones del museo es su laboratorio. "Ahora, uno de nuestros desafíos es estimular a los investigadores y a los estudiantes para que vengan a trabajar con nosotros", dijo Coria, que sue?a con duplicar en un par de a?os el número de científicos que allí realizan su doctorado. <br>  <br>  <br>  Nidos y huellas <br>  <br>  Dos a?os atrás, el Museo Carmen Funes saltó a la fama cuando sus investigadores, en un trabajo de campo conjunto realizado con sus colegas del Museo de Historia Natural de Nueva York, dieron a conocer el hallazgo del mayor yacimiento de huevos de dinosaurio del mundo, desenterrado en Auca Mahuida, al norte de la provincia de Neuquén. El estudio científico que daba cuenta del descubrimiento fue nota de tapa de la prestigiosa revista científica Nature, y las fotos del hallazgo dieron la vuelta al mundo. <br>  <br>  No era para menos. Algunos de los huevos de dinosaurio saurópodo hallados en Auca Mahuida, rebautizada por los paleontólogos Auca Mahuevo, contenían restos de piel y hueso de los embriones. Por primera vez, los paleontólogos eran capaces de observar el cráneo de un embrión de saurópodo y de palpar la rugosa piel de reptil del animal. <br>  <br>  Buena parte de los fósiles desenterrados en Auca Mahuevo están desde ayer en exhibición. También se encuentran expuestas varias series de huellas. Claro que no pertenecen a dinosaurios de gigantescas dimensiones, sino a unos antecesores de las aves del tama?o de una gallina. <br>  <br>  En suma, quien visite el nuevo Museo Carmen Funes se encontrará con la posibilidad única de tener contacto con distintos aspectos de la fauna que habitó la Patagonia durante el cretácico. Y, para el futuro, Coria planea no sólo agrandar el museo, sino enriquecer las colecciones.|`|90c16cfae033dfbdba2a6295d98ec02faa	El Argentinosaurus Huinculensis es el dinosaurio mas grande del mundo, conocido hasta el momento.<br>  El argentinosaurus tenía un peso estimado de 100 toneladas (un elefante africano macho puede pesar hasta 7 toneladas).<br>  Se puede considerar que se trataba de un animal de movimientos lentos, pero no torpes.<br>  Las vértebras de 1,65 metros de alto estaban articuladas entre sí por complejas estructuras de encastre para soportar ese peso.<br>  El argentinosaurus llegó a medir hasta 40 metros de longitud y vivió hace unos 65 millones de a?os (Cretácico Superior) en la zona de Plaza Huincul y Cutral Có, en la provincia de Neuquén, Argentina.

But it could work in your favour if you took the lower levels of the subjects and passed. THen you could tell the uni acceptance people that you chose the lower level instead of the higher one for your own reasons. Loads of work in school can be a factor.<br>  Usually, higher levels of subjects come with more work, so there will be more recognition for the higher subjects, but that doesn't mean you ignore the others. THey also have their loads of work.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Short answer: yes.<br>  Long answer: for any school if you go to their website (which is easy to google) then they usually say somewhere right on one of the front pages exactly how they are acredited. If you can't find it, then just call them and they will be glad to explain it to you. Also, in the college 'catalog' of courses it always lists the accreditiation.

New York University is also a prestigious school They are not quite as hard to get into, but still very hard. Another well-known school in NY is Fordham University, which is run by the Roman Catholic church. <br>  There are many other schools there, which are easier to get into but your chances of getting a scholarship are not good. Millions of international students want to come to the USA for school but there are also a million or more American kids who want to go to college who dont have money to do it. So, the competition is pretty dramatically difficult.

99e98f91bf10f7c81dc5881c812e64bdaa	?QUE ES LA PEDOFILIA? <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Es la presencia de fantasías o conductas que implican actividad sexual entre un adulto y un ni?o.<br>  <br>  Puede darse de diferentes formas: en relación a la orientación, puede ser de tipo heterosexual, homosexual o ambas; en relación a objeto, éste puede ser exclusivamente pedofílico o no.<br>  <br>  Las conductas de la pedofilia van del simple exhibicionismo hasta la penetración. El adulto suele ganarse la confianza y el cari?o del ni?o para luego llevar a cabo sus objetivos.<br>  <br>  Se distinguen dos variantes en la pedofilia:<br>  <br>  La sentimental homoerótica y la agresiva heterosexual. Los sentimentales homoeróticos tienen poco interés por las mujeres, toda su capacidad sexual se concentra en los ni?os, concretándose bajo la forma de caricias que le provocan el orgasmo. Los agresivos heterosexuales intentan satisfacer sus impulsos con ni?as, con métodos que van desde la seducción a la violencia.<br>  <br>  Características personales y sociales del sujeto:<br>  <br>  En su mayoría los pedofílicos son hombres, menos agresivos que los violadores; muchos de ellos son alcohólicos o psicóticos de mente torpe o asociales, y su edad fluctúa entre los 30 y 40 a?os; generalmente, de fuertes convicciones religiosas, en general, son hombres débiles, inmaduros, solitarios y llenos de culpa. <br>  <br>  La personalidad del agresor de mediana o mayor edad es de un individuo solitario y con dificultad para establecer relaciones heterosexuales normales, suele tener baja autoestima, con pocos recursos para enfrentar situaciones de stress y frecuentemente abusa del alcohol y/o sustancias. Por lo general, no presenta trastorno psicopatológico. Sin embargo, se ha visto que dos tercios de los reclusos pedofílicos maduros llevaron a cabo esta conducta en momentos que sufrían de situaciones estresantes. <br>  <br>  El pedofílico no se acerca a los adultos debido a que teme ser castrado por ellos, que son representantes de sus padres, hacia los que dirige sus impulsos incestuosos. <br>  <br>  Se identifica con su madre y se relaciona con los ni?os de la misma manera como a?ora que debiera ser su relación con ella, por ese motivo es que elige a ni?os que puedan representarlo a él mismo. El temor a la castración intensifica su narcisismo, por la necesidad de protegerse a sí mismo.<br>  <br>  Poco se sabe de las causas, pero se dice que una de ellas es el aprendizaje de actitudes negativas hacia el sexo, como experiencias de abuso sexual durante la ni?ez, sentimientos de inseguridad y autoestima baja, con dificultad en relaciones personales; lo que facilita la relación adulto-ni?o.<br>  <br>  En algunos casos de pedofilia resulta beneficiosa la técnica de la desensibilización encubierta, en la que se asocian los factores estimulantes para el sujeto con situaciones aversivas que resultarían de la expresión de sus impulsos; al avanzar el tratamiento se entrena a los pacientes para que imaginen la atracción por mujeres adultas. <br>  <br>  Frecuentemente se observa una disminución de la atracción hacia las ni?as y una disminución aún mayor en la ansiedad producida por las mujeres.|`|c1d289372ebf322d58c2d1441bec5ce8aa	La pedofilia es la relacion sexual con menores,no es contagioso,es aberrante.|`|cec877e2e6d2f990a6550daf9e337a76aa	los que tienen relaciones sexuales con ni?os|`|fe12afcd1ca63078d54eef6221415792aa	Si, si se q es|`|257070287441810e9047bfef7939f0c7aa	Es el sexo con los ni?os, existen personas enfermas que tienen sexo anal con los ni?os|`|29d2dec3bae9b791083eaf1fb7b5e24faa	Pero cómo iba a ser contagioso!!!!!!|`|6cebb99f99a6a5ae99a5cd84d4a20591aa	la pedofilia es la aficion por tener o ver sexo con NI?OS, esta penado, obviamente, no es contagioso, lo puede tener cualquier persona, se dice q es comun en personas transtornadas mentalmente o q fueron violadas o abusadas cuando fueron ni?os.|`|b7e76cd4dfafefd3f676d0cf774aaf1caa	es sentir atracción sexual por los ni?os.

En los últimos dos a?os la policía de este país desbarató sendas cadenas de pervertidores de menores y traficantes de pornografía infantil, que incluían conexiones con países como Espa?a, Venezuela, Chile o el Reino Unido. Muchas de estas personas están hoy cumpliendo las condenas impuestas por ser hallados, en mayor o menor grado, culpables del delito de "abuso sexual calificado y perversión de menores".<br>  <br>  En Espa?a, el Código Penal no tiene un artículo específico para castigar al pedófilo sino que, en concordancia con la Tradición del derecho en Espa?a de castigar el resultado, no la mera intención, pena el efecto de dicha pedofília; es decir, que no es delito ser pedófilo, sino efectuar actos de pedofilia.<br>  <br>  Así, por ejemplo, el que mantenga relaciones sexuales con un menor podrá ser castigado con la pena del arto 180 del Código Penal, como autor de un delito de Agresión Sexual con agravantes. Si dichas relaciones no consisten en introducción de objeto o parte alguna del cuerpo en las cavidades bucales, genitales o anales, serán consideradas un delito de Abusos Deshonestos, y, siempre que el menor lo sea de 12 a?os o menos, serán siempre considerados como no consentidos y se les aplicará la pena prevista en el arto 181. Por último, aquellos que se exhibieren obscenamente ante menores, por sí o por otros, serán castigados conforme al arto 185, y los que difundieren, vendieren o exhibieren material pornográfico a menores de edad, lo serán en virtud del arto 186.<br>  <br>  Mas informacion en:

They have valuable brand names to protect. They have thousands of employees. <br>  <br>  Failing to plan is planning to fail!|`|3f9e4ad8ff832a0183b81cb572ca0b46aa	The first answer was excellent. Colleges and universities do have to plan, just like any organization. They must manage their resources, such as employees, facilities and budgets, effectively, and they must make sure they're providing quality service to their "Customers" (students), and they also have to make sure that they keep the customers coming in the doors. Hundreds of colleges have closed their doors over the last 20 years for failing to plan effectively. To learn more about why and how colleges and universities need to plan, you might read the trade publication called University Business, which can be found at www.universitybusiness.com<br>  Carolyn Lawrence, www.AdmissionsAdvice.com
1a9e4d57320cb7594a39fb95ad34cf07aa	My mother graduated from that program and NYU is a great school (my grandfather still teaches there).  I have been to the campus many times.  However, it is a very expensive school to attend as well.  If you want to go to top notch education program you wont find any better.  It real matters what you want.  If you are just interested in getting a degree in teaching I would suggest just going to your local state school. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	NYU is a very good school which is highly respected. But, as a teacher, how are you ever going to pay back those loans!?<br>  $50,000 in just one year? And of course, NY is a very expensive place to live, so does that include your living costs during the entire year?  This sounds like a pretty bad idea to me.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of very respectable schools for educators around the USA. Especially, many state universities have great departments of education. So I think you should pass by this offer and be more practical. That will be a bit of a heartache, but when you are out of school and you dont have $100,000 in debt then you will realize you made the wise choice.

It is NOT easy and should not be something that is taken lightly. I'm in my third year of med-school and I don't see life getting easy for me any time soon. Having said that, let me break it down for you....<br>  <br>  Unless you are loaded to start with, you will need loans and lots of them for tuition and cost of living for 4 years. Remember you won't be able to work while in school. So that sets you back at least $150,000 before you even get your MD (not including any college debt you might have). In the 4 years following med-school you will have to do residency training. During residency you will get a salary of about $40,000 per year. That's barely enough to cover living and loan payments (which have aquired intrest). So, after 8 long years you can finally start to put a dent in the debt you racked up in school with a six figure salary, but you still have malpractice insurance to buy which is easily $50,000 per year. Doctors don't become rich until they are well into middle age. <br>  <br>  So, if you really WANT to become a doctor to be a doctor, then go for it. If you are doing it because other people want you to and say you'll make more money, you will be miserable and sadly dissapointed. The quick money is a job in business. <br>  <br>  Courage.

diAMW4hxaa	"Go to a real school with real teachers, real buildings, real labs, and real other students. There are hundreds of respectable schools that will give you a great education - don't fool around with this online BS" Matt has little experience with distance degrees. <br>  <br>  I am getting my Bachelor of Science in Natural Resources (specializing in Fish and Wildlife Conservation) entirely through distance from a reputable, traditional "brick and mortar" university (Oregon State). I will graduate with honors and get the same degree as everybody else. Before it can be refuted I HAVE gone to traditional brick and mortar schools and my education has been considerably better through the distance program. My instructors are all well educated and teach both traditional and non-traditional formats. They have always been there to assist, more so than any instructors I have had taking classes the traditional way. The education I have received is just as good, if not better, than the traditional format.<br>  <br>  I DO have to agree with Matt in that I started out wanting to get a distance degree in Biology or Ecology but let's face it, that's not going to happen. I found unaccredited universities willing to "give" me a degree for a fee but what good is that? I settled for Natural Resources because it falls in my line of work and I still get to take awesome courses like ichthyology, mammology, and ornithology. I have thoroughly enjoyed this degree path. <br>  <br>  When looking for distance degrees go only for accredited universities. Be prepared to work hard because you have to be highly motivated and organized. Now, (not wanting to take anything away from traditional schools) get your basics out of the way at a local community college and save yourself some money. Pick a degree first, then pick a distance program and find out what the pre-requisites are, then tailor your community college classes to it..trust me, you'll be glad you did.<br>  <br>  Remember that the quality of the education you receive equates to the amount of time you are willing to put into it.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your search!|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	No, there aren't.<br>  <br>  THere are some reputable universities that offer SOME courses online.

AA10926886	Every PhD program with which I am familiar (in the US) begins with two years of coursework, and requires residency for either two or three years.  The third year is most commonly spent preparing for and taking qualifying exams and language exams, as well as researching, writing, and defending the dissertation proposal.<br>  <br>  One could conceivably fly in for qualifying and language exams, as well as for the proposal presentation and defense.  PhD programs that only require two years of residence are clearly allowing for this possibility.<br>  <br>  In one's fourth year, when researching and writing the dissertation, one obviously need not be in residence, as long as one has access to an excellent academic library.<br>  <br>  Therefore, I am assuming that the folks you've met are ABD (all but dissertation).  <br>  <br>  If you can manage four semesters away from your career, then you should be able to complete a PhD program in the traditional manner.<br>  <br>  I should add that three-year long fellowships and assistantships are the usual means of financing doctoral study.  Assistantships in particular would necessitate residency, since they involve research and/or teaching responsibilities on campus.<br>  <br>  I am not sure if this is at all helpful to you, but I do wish you every success.|`|c19de86373770af6c318fa6913fb77b4aa	In the US at regular schools PhD progarms are NOT very flexible. Its a machine and they want you there on the scene as a cog.<br>  <br>  You know what I would do if I had your qualifications (and if I was 30 again---oh, so young!--)?  I would look at a PhD in International Studies.  These programs tend to be a lot more flexible than standard PhD programs in traditional (old-fashioned) subjects like Political Science, History, English, etc.<br>  <br>  As far as wanting a career in academia-I bet you will find you do not like it much.  It is not what you think it is.  <br>  <br>  You probably think that university academics discuss heady and important concepts, right?  <br>  <br>  Nope, faculty meetings run like this:  Whaa Whaa Whaa.  People are talking too loud in the hall.  The coffee was not strong/weak enough. I am not getting my messages. My office is too cold, cramped, hot. The President of the University/Football coach/Basketball coach just built a huge new house and I cannot afford to ----fill in the blank-----.   Etc etc.<br>  <br>  Maybe you will want to get a PhD and expand father into International Studies, or become an ambassador, or something.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	For most PhD programs there are some very specific requirement for courses that must be taken in residence at the university. But, once those are completed in the second year, then you start on your dissertation. If you were doing Asian studies, most schools would expect you to go to Asia. You would be expected to speak the language and be very familiar with the culture. You aren't going to get your degree until you finish your dissertation, so if you head off to Asia, spend ten years diddling around writing a dissertation, most universities wouldnt care, as long as you kept paying your tuition and fees every semester. Some schools set a time limit - at UCal I believe they give you three years after you finish your courses to work on your dissertation at a very reduced tuition fee. THen if you dont finish in three years they figure you need a kick inthe pants so they dramatically increase your tuition after the third year of dissertation writing. <br>  <br>  Interesting, isn't it, that someone who claims to direct a PhD program has time in the middle of the day to be doodling around here on Yahoo with us retired guys?
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The US News site gives a listing of what it considers to be the best colleges in the USA. There are some arguments about whether this list is fair, but generally it is pretty good. <br>  <br>  Here's what you need to know about "best" colleges. In the USA there are eight universities that make up the Ivy League. Then there are about six or seven other very highly respected schools, and anoth ten or twenty schools ranked just below those. For instance: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth, Penn, Brown, Columbia, COrnell, Duke, Stanford, MIT, CalTech, Chicago, Washington University, Emory etc...   these schools are all rather small. The total number of Freshmen who will enter these colleges is only about 20,000 all together total.  In the USA alone there are 2,000,000 students who will enter college this year. <br>  So, only 1% of American students will be entered in an elite school. That measn the competition for a seat in these schools is very tough. You need to have very, very good marks, SAT scores, and you need a lot of money. Only about half the kids in these schools have significant scholarships. The other 50% pay $40,000 or more per year. <br>  That's your competition. <br>  <br>  But beyond the top 10 or 15 schools there are many other very good schools. Check the US News list and look at the schools in the bottom of the top 100 list, or in the second tier. Many of those schools can give you an excellent education. And some of them have plenty of smart students -- only 20,000 can go to elite schools but there are WAY more than 20,000 smart students in the USA.....|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	There are so many.........|`|Bnz5uQNPaa	Check out FreeSchoolHelp.com, it has a link that shows "The Best Colleges Rating", and then has links to all colleges out there, scholarship info, etc. Very Helpful.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	I haven't heard anything bad about UAF but I was up there last year and wow! it's really far out there! Fairbanks is hardly a wide space in the road and it's a long way from Anchorage, which is just a modest sixed town and Anchorage is a long way from the rest of the world. <br>  <br>  Don't go there unless you visit first, and preferably during the school year, not during the summer when the tourists are around and life is beautiful.... <br>  <br>  But, if you like it when you visit, then Go for it!|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	No sorry.......
jAiQTbrZaa	Congrats on your acceptance to your second choice school! If you want to apply for financial aid, do that by the date they tell you. Applying for financial aid does not require any commitment to attend the college. However, do not register for any classes yet. You should be able to get the classes you want later. It seems like they are just rushing you to make a decision so they know how many students are planning to enter their class. Wait until April to register for classes, pick your housing, etc. You have plenty of time. Don't worry. And good luck on getting into your first choice!|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	They should not be asking you to do anything irrevocable before the 15 of April. By that time most schools will have sent out their acceptances. I think that what your #2 is doing is basically unethical! They should not be trying to get you pinned down before your other offers are completed. It's like a used car saleman telling you he can give you a great deal if you sign RIGHT NOW!  If they are asking you to make sure that your financial aid and other matters are all completed, that's OK, but they should not be asking you to give them a definite yes, or to send them any money. <br>  <br>  Just keep a neat file of all these letters and wait patiently until after April 1.  Then if your #1 accepts you, you will be happy and can toss all the #2 letters away. and if your #1 turns you down, then you can go ahead and do your #2 stuff. They are definitely not going to revoke your acceptance if you wait until April. And the owrst that could happen is you might miss getting registered for a course and have to take it next term. No big deal.|`|5cc28936ff79ea70f21874f8bc874ed2aa	It really depends on whether the college is absolutely-positively your "second choice." What if your third choice offers you a better scholarship or financial aid package; would that change things? Would number-two become your first choice, if the school that is currently your first choice didn't offer you enough financial aid or put you on a waiting list or dropped an athletic program? <br>  <br>  If it is truly your real second choice and nothing could affect your decision to matriculate except an acceptance from your first choice, then you should take some actions. You could call their admissions office and let them know you are waiting on a reply from your first choice and why that school is your first choice, maybe they can do something extra for you that will change the order of your preferences. They will not withdraw their offer to you, unless you wait until after their absolute deadline for letting them know. That is certain. <br>  <br>  If it comes down to that deadline and your first choice has put you on a waiting list and has not yet definitely offered to accept you, then you should call them and tell the admissions officer at your first choice that you have to know NOW. If they cannot make a decision, accept the offer from your second choice; then call the first choice again and withdraw your application.  <br>  <br>  If you want to be nice, after being accepted by the second choice, you could also call your third, fourth, fifth, and lower choices and withdraw your applications. That way they can make better choices on who they should accept.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The most famous online degree school is the University of Phoenix. Before you consider wasting money on an online degree you should read the article in this morning's NY TImes (Sunday, Feb 11, 2007) about the U of P, how they received a gigantic fine for "systematic" lying, and how as few as 5% of their students actually finish their degrees. Also, they are the subject of many lawsuits which they themselves have said may bankrupt them and put them out of business! <br>  <br>  Don't get involved in this fiasco. Go to a real school with real building and teachers who have made a lifetime commitment to teaching and learning.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	There are very few USA schools that will admit a student to study premed without having taken SAT or ACT. Some schools do not require them, but they do require detailed transcripts from your secondary school showing that you have studied all the prereq courses - that is, four years English, three-four years math up to calculus, etc. <br>  <br>  Most of the schools that are highly respected for science and premed would require SAT, so why not just take it and get it over with. When you are in college you will have to take the MCATs to get into medical school, and they are much tougher, so you probably need the practice anyway.
AA10738122	poetry is for poets<br>  prose is for writer|`|AA11624675	Wow, is that incorrect. <br>  Most poetry does NOT rhyme. <br>  <br>  What distinguishes is that thought is put into poetry to create an art out of the language. That art can involve rhyme, but, as I said, usually does not. Romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Romanian) easily rhyme. Germanic languages (e.g., English) do not. A poem can instead use pairing or contrast (e.g., the book of Proverbs in the Bible), imagery, allusion, metaphor or simile, as well as word-play and RHYTHM, which last one is probably the most important. <br>  <br>  Prose merely gives the information in standard school-type sentences.|`|AA11051504	donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donnodonno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donnodonno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno<br>  donno <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   HOW YA LIKE THEM APPLES?|`|QlmBYMpNaa	Poetry rhymes

To get my Associate's for only $900 a semester, including books, for a low, no interest monthly payment, was something I couldn't pass!  I am a little nervous about what will happen once I complete if I am interested in continuing my education and getting my Bachelor's.  But according to last month's newsletter, they will be announcing colleges in which they are forming a partnership that will accept our credits.  I know University of Phoenix is the most reputable and most likely to be accepted at major universities for transfer, but have you seen their cost?  Outrageous!  You have to determine what your long term goals are.  If you already know what college you plan on attending next, you need to talk to them and see if they will take your credits.  Good luck!

That is a system to evaluate your financial situation in order to make recommendations to schools about how much you might be eligible for in scholarships or loans. <br>  <br>  After you send in your FAFSA forms they have to be evaluated by a school financial aid office. The school will use the FAFSA report to decide what amount of aid to offer you. Every school does it differently so you can't know how much you will get until you apply to a school and the school works up a financial plan for you.|`|AA10878279	The amount you will get from FAFSA can not be determined just by how much you made.  It depends on how much the school costs and how much you need.  Plus you are always capable of getting a loan.|`|AA10988786	generally if you submit your FAFSA soon enough, the average Pell Grant is 4050, which will span over two semesters, therefore, you will have 2025 per semester.

They have a lot of classes taught by grad students and some of them are probably pretty bad. But they also have some very good profs, including some who have retired after being famous for decades at other schools and who are teaching at U of A basically just for fun. They can be really world class teachers.<br>  <br>  You should understand that a very large fraction of the students are from Arizona, so you can expect to have a large number of extremely conservative kids around you who think that anyone from Massachusetts (home of Kerry and the Kennedys) is basically the devil's spawn. But if you can get past that , you will find lots of interesting kids, and the landscape and surrounding environment will be a total change.  When you arrive at school it will be 100 plus degrees and stay hot until October. <br>  <br>  So, if it sounds good to you, then go for it. It will definitely not be a boring experience!|`|1a9ec43ce9d98bf13970482d4064185caa	ummm well ur GPA could be higher..but it is a state school (ASU) so the requirments should be lower....UA might be tougher to get into...i say being frm out of state is a good thing...<br>  <br>  just work on your grades and stuff...<br>  <br>  good luck

It is part of the agriculture dept and they have a lot of experimental grass. The students major in lawn grass. I know that sounds silly, but it is a serious program and they all get good jobs working for big golf resorts and other properties that have extensive lawns to care for. URI is a respectable school and you can get a good education there.

AA11417005	First, you need to figure out why you are scared to read out loud. Is there another person in there that you have your eye on and you don't want to make a food of yourself? Or is it because you are afraid of making a mistake and the teacher cutting you down because of it. Once you've figured that out, finding ways to avoid that fear is very simple. <br>  Second, practice reading out loud at home. Once you feel comfortable reading to yourself, then try volunteering to read to your younger siblings/friends siblings. If you can handle them, then you've already mastered a much harder audience than your 10th grade engilsh class.<br>  Last, try volunteering to read aloud. If your teacher sees that you are willing to read, then maybe (s)he won't call on you as much. <br>  <br>  I've had this same problem reading out loud as well. I was afraid of making a mistake and being laughed at, but once i realized that everyone will laugh at your mistakes whether you intend to make them or not, and all you can do is laugh right along with them, then reading was not such a problem anymore.<br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope you can get over this fear!|`|AA11136775	Tell your teachers about the anxiety that it causes you - I am a teacher and I would not make a student read aloud if it caused these things - let them know, they will probably let you off the hook until you are ready.|`|f809ad7a277dc08772fdde0f723a826aaa	It happens to everyone now and again i promis. even i still do it sometimes.

They have a medical school, nursing school, school of the environment and engineering school, but no fine arts college. <br>  <br>  That kind of comment makes me think you have really not done your homework when it comes to researching schools. <br>  <br>  ps. if your name implies that you are interested in theatre or dance, you should probably consider Fordham university in NYC. They have a campus at Lincoln Center, literally directly across the street from the Metropolitan Opera and the New York State Theater. Fordham is academically equal to NYU and just a notch below Columbia. <br>  <br>  Try to look through the websites of the elite universities and decide which of them fits your needs. If you want to do arts, then Columbia is not such a great choice. They have a very demanding core curriculum there which requires reading a lot of classic western thought (dead white guys).  On the other end of the spectrum, Brown University has no core curriculum at all.

Now it is a modern, technological center with a dynamic population of well educated people. That didnt happen by accident!!

They are yours for life. <br>  Good news: You woke up and realized that you were screwing yourself over before it was too late. What has to happen is, you have to totally change your grades. The transcript you hand an employer has to show a dramatic shift from bad grades to uniformly good grades. And to get a decent GPA you will have to take maybe an extra year as an undergraduate before you leave school. Maybe you should consider changing your major or even changing schools. THat way the shift would be even more noticeable.<br>  <br>  To get into a decent grad school you have to get your GPA up over 3.0 at the bare minimum. Preferably 3.5. That is going to be tough.

b5gLlErHaa	Did or will either of the universitys accept you?  That's step 1.<br>  <br>  Step 2 could be to list the pros and cons of each school.  After having your lists, assign point values (1-10 or 1-100) based on your values to each pro or con.  When these are done, add the values of the pros for school 1.  Now, add the values of the cons for school 1.  Say pros=35 and cons=50.  Subtract the cons from the pros (35-50)----this gives you a -15 value.  Do the same for school too.  Assume pros=35 and cons=5.  Do the same (35-5)----this gives you a +30 value.  Now compare:  -15 vs +30  Know which one to choose?<br>  <br>  I use the above system alot when I have a choice to make with 2 or more opttions that are both appealing.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	In the USA most colleges divide the school year in two - a 14 week Fall term and a 14 week Spring term. (some schools divide the year in three  11 week parts).<br>  <br>  In each term (or "semester") a student usually takes four or five courses. Each course meets 14 weeks and one two or three hours a week. For each hour the course meets each week, that is one credit. A course that meets three times a week (one hour each time) for 14 weeks, would be a three credit course. <br>  <br>  So a normal amount of courses would be five courses times three credits, or 15 credit in one term.  Sometimes if you are a good student or if you are taking easy courses, you might take one or at most two extra courses. A 21 credit course load would be considered a very heavy load. No one takes 60 credits in one term unless the school is measuring credits in some very unusual and non-standard way.<br>  <br>  Student take about 15 to 18 credits in fall, 15 to 18 in spring, for four years, so the total number of credits they need for a degree is about 115 to 135 depending on what program they are in. Generally science students and engineers have to take more credits because they have courses with laboratory assignments. <br>  <br>  The websites for different colleges often tell exactly how many credits you need for a degree.|`|AA11390453	Credits are just like how much a class is "worth". To get a degree you have to have a certain number of credits in a designated number of areas. For most people this takes four years but for people that can work their credits (some classes count as credits towards two separate areas) it can take a lot less time. The college I went to, for the most part, a math, computer or science class was four credits and almost everything else was three. There were some classes that only had two credits and a few that didn't stick with the aforementioned rule. For instance, when I started I was below the college level in math so my first math class was only worth three credits instead of four.<br>  <br>  Your major is directly related to how many credits it takes to graduate. Like a Chemistry major takes a lot of math and science classes which give more credits than, say, language and history classes so, at the end of the whatever number of years it takes to get your degree, a Chem major will have more credits than an English major but there's a chance they took the same number of classes.<br>  <br>  I don't really see how someone can get 62 credits a semester though. I was a bio major before I "dropped out" (lack of fundage, I'm working on it) and even in my most studious semester I only garnished 24 credits and that was only because I had a letter from the educational counselor saying I was allowed to take more than the "recommended" number of classes (something, btw, I do *not* recommend doing unless you have absolutely no social life, no need for sleep and know of a 24 hour library. I only met two of those criteria and at the end of term I literally passed out from exhaustion).<br>  <br>  Ugh. There's also the problem that some states work differently. I'm pretty sure we all use the same credit scheme because the high schools use it (I went to four high schools in three states and they all used credits) but I don't know if the distribution would be different. They were all pretty much the same when I was in high school but I've only gone to Texas colleges so I can't really be sure about, like, a college in New York, Cali or Idaho. And I'm not familiar with Birds of Prey so I don't know what state they're in.

To become a physician, in college you can major in almost anything you want, but you must complete the difficult prerequisite courses needed to be admitted to medical college. When you get your BS or BA degree and complete the MCATs (like SATs only much harder) the you can apply for med school. After you complete four years of medical school then you can apply to do a residency in oncology. After about 3 to 5 years you will be a junior partner in a medical practice that specializes in treating cancers. <br>  For more information about medical schools see the website of the Association of American Medical Colleges.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Sorry to disagree, but I do not think your EMT experience will be much use to you. <br>  <br>  To become a physician you must attend Medical College. The process to be admitted to med school is very competitive. You must first get a BS or BA degree from a four year college.  During that time you must take a series of pre-requisite courses that med schools require. Some of these courses such as organic chemistry and biochemistry require a lot of memorization. You cannot get a good mark in organic chemistry unless you are well prepared, smart and hardworking. <br>  <br>  After you take these tough courses you must take a hard set of tests called the MCATs. There are like the SAT tests that high school kids take, but the MCATs are much harder. <br>  <br>  Once you have taken all the prerequisite courses and scored well on the MCATs then you can apply to be admitted to med school. About half the people who are fully qualified are turned down. <br>  <br>  Med school is difficult. There is a LOT of memorization. The doctors who are teaching the med students are very demanding and expect the students to be well prepared at all time. When you finish med school after four years, then you must apply to a residency in the special area of medicine that you want to practice. You spend several years in residency before you are allowed to practice medicine on your own. <br>  <br>  This is a very tough and demanding series of challenges. Tough, not impossible, if you are dedicated and determined.|`|7bdf4c3e1bdcb2ffdacd72388e5cef04aa	First you must figure out which Colleges of Medicine you'd be interested and look at their pre-requisite requirements.  All schools are different and require different coursework.  You'll have to take some very basic college classes before you can even apply to medical school.  Your first aid knowledge will definitely help you, but it may not be much help until you actually get into medical school.  There is a lot to understand and memorize in medical school.  Luckily, there are many systems and many drugs that act the same way, so its not as overwhelming as it seems at first.  You can learn the basics and then compare other things to it as a way to memorize.  Its much easier to classify things than try to memorize every individual thing.

Good luck in pursuing your dreams!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Can I ask why I got a thumbs down?<br>  <br>  Edit: I am going to correct myself.  I greatly, but not purposely, overexagerated the cost of tuition.  It is about 40,000 a year, but you also have to factor in the cost of living in New York, dorm and meal plan costs, and other extras.  It will generally come out to around 50,000 a year after everything.|`|Om4rKwgwaa	You'd probably need a 3.7 or higher GPA.  NYU is so well-known that they can afford to be exclusive.  Make sure you excel in English and Journalism classes (if your school has one).  Try for the school newspaper too.  Journalism is VERY competitive, so you need all the experience you can get.  If there are any online publications or anything that you can get involved in along the way, go for it.  Internships are gold as well, so if you can ever do one of those, go for it too.

AA10515207	I'd suggest getting a tutor.  Maybe in summer school you can get another chance to take the first semester over.  I just realized I assumed you were in high school.  If you're in college, try the tutor or ask the professor about the areas where you're weak and what he would suggest you do to understand the material better.  Sometimes just learning how to study a certain subject in a different way can make all the difference.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you're already looking ahead to a speciality.  Just remember that you have to do rotations (usually six-weeks if I remember correctly) in each speciality.  You may decide neither one  suits you.<br>  <br>  Just don't give up!

The professor is probably going to intentionally try to weed out kids who should not be going to med school. You have to prove that you can do it. <br>  <br>  I don't agree with the other answer about it not mattering much. I think it matters a lot. You definitely need to get at least a B in the second term. <br>  <br>  One group of six kids I tutored did this course together. They made a pact. Every day they got up, went to the library and studied together until class, then back to the library, then to sleep. <br>  <br>  That's all they did for 11 weeks. Library, class and sleep.  When the term was over, 15 kids of 190 in their class had A's. All six of them got A's. <br>  <br>  How badly do you want to be a physician? If you have the determination to do it, you can do it.

What prevented you from doing well in class? If the coursework was hard, try to review it before next semester starts. And dont worry about one C, as long as you keep up your good work, it will even out. Medical schools are looking for high MCAT scores more than GPA.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	In the USA you must get a BS or BA degree before you apply to medical college. You can major in anything you want as long as you take the pre-requisite courses that med schools demand. Most applicants probably major in biology or chemistry.<br>  <br>  There is no official major  "pre-med" but in many schools they have some kind of a program to support kids who are getting ready to do the difficult application process for med school. So the college will have a pre-med advisor who knows how that works and who will give advice to the students who want to apply to med school.

So, if you are one of the 150 or so best students in the world outside the USA, speak English very fluently, got 800 on your SAT math exams, and have graduated at the top ofyour class from one of the best high schools in your country, then you have a chance to get into MIT. Otherwise, you should consult princetonreview.com or collegeboard.com for lists of some other good schools among the 3,800 universities in the United States.|`|tTHdGHLUaa	Suggest you? OK, I suggest . . . YOU.  How will you be highly obliged? You shouldn't be even able to get into USA never mind MIT.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	There are several reasons why there might be a perception - which I think is mostly false - that standards in English have slipped inthe USA over the last few years.<br>  <br>  First, there are far more immigrants in the USA today than 25 years ago. Currently the USA has the largest proportion of people who are not native English speakers since the great immigration periods of 100 years ago.  So, of course there are many people whose English skills are not the best. <br>  <br>  Second, during the 1970s and 1980s the standards for teachers were very low and a lot of people entered teaching who were poorly qualified. I think this has reversed in recent years but there are still many of these marginally capable people in place in schools all over the country.<br>  <br>  Third, when making comparisons, it is grossly unfair to compare today's students agains the students of 40 years ago. In my day, back in the 1960s, only about 10 -20% of HS kids ever attended college. Now it is closer to 60-70%. So we are comparing college kids in the 4th or 5th decile today against kids in the 1st decile 40 years ago. Of course, the old kids look better when you make that kind of comparison. <br>  <br>  I was involved in a history project where we went to the museum and edited old diaries and letters from soldiers in the CIvil War, WW I and WWII - believe me, there were plenty of really bad writers in the old days! Some of them were so bad, you could hardly tell what they meant. Jane Austen has a couple comments in her novels where she makes fun of the poor writing skills of women in particular.  <br>  <br>  We've come a long way since those days!|`|594003c4c20be1518753b6736ea84fc9aa	America has allowed its young people to be "dumbed down" through popular culture.  Whenever we allow misspellings, slang, and abbreviations to substitute for actual words, our students develop the an inability to distinguish and utilize proper English.  I teach and am amazed at the number of college students who have poor spelling and grammatical skills.  There is also the belief that as Americans, we need not know how to do anything other than "play the game" of success, rather than strive for true intelligence.

So this word is possibly the right word to use.|`|d2YvAtOjaa	A student who has 'dropped out' can be referred to as an early leaver. <br>  If you want to make this more specific, they can be called an early leaver with no achievement.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	According to an article in the NY Times this morning, Columbia got 20,000 applicants this year and accepted about 1800. They turned down hundreds of valedictorians and kids with 800 SATs, etc. <br>  <br>  It isnt good enough to be smart, hardworking and dedicated. You also have to be outstanding in some creative way. Have you won a gold medal in a national competition? Have you done something that really made a difference to the lives of people in your town? What makes you better than all those other kids with 10 AP's and 4.4 GPAs?  <br>  <br>  If you have a good answer, they are looking for you. If you have to think twice about it, you probably arent special enough. Not to worry, though. There are over 4000 college campuses in the USA and over 4000 of them admit more than 50% of the applicants.|`|9r9rJeDjaa	as a high school college program coordinator, i have 4 kids apply to each.  no one got into columbia, two into georgetown.  from what i can tell, you're looking at:<br>  1. NUMBERS!!! (3.8+ unweighted, 1350+ (maybe less for urban kids)<br>  2. APs, honors, and college classes<br>  3. student leadership positions<br>  4. extracurriculars - sports, theater, etc.<br>  5. solid letters of rec & personal statement
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	One reason for the lack of appeal letters is because most schools do not allow appeals. Check the website for admissions for the school you are interested in. Many of them say, no appeal, all decisions are final. <br>  <br>  But if you can't think of some really good reasons why they should change their minds about a careful decision they made, then you probably arent going to be able to change their minds. No form letter is going to make any impression.<br>  <br>  The admissions committees are pretty good at deciding who is a good match for their school. They already saw what you had to say. So why don't you think over what their decision was, and accept the decision. Go to one of the schools that accepted you.|`|83JaRfVhaa	hi, did you find a site for sample appeal letters? i am also frantically searching...     :(|`|d0UsvSSqaa	Send me an e-mail/message and I can sent you one that I used in real-life that worked.

Drive to Cornell - one day, drive back to New Haven to see Yale - one day, then to Columbia one day, Penn and Princeton one day, back to Providence to see Brown, and to Harvard one day and then back to the airport. One week to ten days total. You could check out NYU, Fordham, BU, BC, MIT, Northeastern, Middlebury, Willams, Amherst and a few others along the way.<br>  <br>  Nothing to it!

ABD means "all but dissertation" - in other words, it is a way of describing someone who tried to get to be a PhD but couldn't hack it. The dissertation is the only hard part of getting a PhD - the rest is just taking a few courses, no different than being an undergraduate. But doing the dissertation requires real research and creative thought. It is what makes PhD respected. So, an "ABD" is someone who tried and failed. Using this as a title is basically an insult to the person reminding them of their humiliation.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	To be a Radiologist you must be a physician. That means four years in college taking a Bachelor's degree, getting top scores in your science classes and in the MCAT tests, and then being admitted to Medical School and spending four tough years before receiving your M.D. and then doing several years of residency in radiology.<br>  <br>  Probably your Army training will qualify you to be a radiology technician or assistant, so you will have no troube getting a job when you get out of the Army, but you will not be a "radiologist."<br>  <br>  Good luck in the army. Keep your head down!!!
HpSZbQaoaa	Give more info on what your looking for... that would help people answer your question but yes, they are completely different. USC is definitely a football and party school. Supposedly our (Frat) Row is infamous and there are crazy parties there mostly on thurs thru sat. It also is very strong academically in Business and other majors, but your extracurricular life will never be bored.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	These schools are both well respected, and both could provide you with a good education. But they are TOTALLY different in terms of what kind of experience you are going to have at school. <br>  <br>  Either you prefer a rather conservative, religious student body, in a not very interesting small  city in the South, or you want to go to school in LA with a bunch of wild and crazy Californians. <br>  <br>  To me, this would not even be a choice at all. But I guess it depends what is important to you. How in the world did you ever come to apply to two such totally different schools?|`|5lpS748Jaa	USC baby all the way.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Nearly all US colleges mainly accept applications for students starting in the Fall term (end of August or early September). Some schools do accept applications all year, but the main application season for the 2007-2008 school year is over.  Generally forthe higher ranked schools, students are asked to file their completed applications by Jan 1 and the admissions decisions are given out at the beginning of April. Then students must decide which school they will attend and notify the university by May 1.  You may have noticed recently on Yahoo that there were a lot of questions asking "which school should I go to?" for all the students who are struggling with multiple acceptances. <br>  <br>  The schools that accept applications all year or who have "rolling" admissions - meaning that you apply any time and then they tell you a few weeks later if you are accepted -- tend to be the much less selective schools, the ones that are actively trying to find more students.  In some cases the "rolling" acceptances are large state universities, some of which are very respectable schools. <br>  <br>  Remember not to use that computer shorthand spelling and language in ANY communication whatsoever that anyone at the college might see. That is highly unprofessional. It would really be better if you never used it at all.|`|aedbbb48ab695b7d421b084ba12ba6b1aa	The spring term is almost over. You can apply for the fall term starting in August. Most schools have a deadline of June 4
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	A big part of biology is the lab courses. You can't take labs over the internet, you have to be there!

But, do you really think that someone who is careless about spelling can be careful about all the details and tiny little specific facts that doctors have to know? Do you think anyone who is too inept to check out this topic by himself can really be a good enough student to get through the brutally tough medical school courses. <br>  <br>  You need to either get serious about the idea of medicine, or forget it.|`|F5lCFvqeaa	It would help if you knew how to spell 'school'.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Duke has a gorgeous campus with every kind of facility that a college could possibly want. Beautiful chapel, giant library, lovely athletic fields, a lush garden full of flowering trees and plants, etc etc<br>  <br>  Their website explains all about the university, the Duke medical school and hospital, the law school, etc etc <br>  <br>  The competition to get into the school is very tough. They attract about 20,000 applications from all over the world to fill up a class of 1600 freshmen. If you want to go there you will have to be a top student who took the toughest courses in your high school and got A's.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	This is not such an easy question to answer because all the schools jiggle the statistics to make themselves sound better. A school might say they have 70% accepted, but 70% of what?  Is it 70% of all people who started at that college as premed? That would only be true at the most elite schools like MIT, Chicago or Duke.  But maybe it's 70% of all Seniors who are premed? That would be true of schools that are very good. Maybe it's only 70% of the kids who started as premed, didnt get washed out or drop premed because they couldn't hack it, finished the premed courses, got the approval of the faculty and applied to more than ten schools?  That could be just about any college.<br>  <br>  If you want to go premed you have to go to the most rigorous college you can get into. You have to take the tough premed courses and get A's and you have to do everything else that your premed advisor tells you to do. Then you will have a decent chance to get into med school. If you shirk the hard courses, or get B's or God Forbid, a C!!! then the med schools are going to have a tough time awarding you one of those valuable seats....
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	You need to check the course catalogs really carefully and see what courses are listed at each school. Once you check it out, then you may see that one is better than the other for science. I would probably go with UMass for three reasons - first, it's in Boston! Second, if you decided to change majors or you wanted more courses, then you could transfer to UMass Amherst without losing any credits; and Third, there are way more opportunities for research spots or internships in Boston than in Springfield. <br>  Good luck - we need more science majors!|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Well, since I've never heard of AIC and I lived about 20 min away from it for 4 years (apparently), I'd say UMass Boston.  Matt's right, UMass Amherst has excellent science programs - go to Boston and then try to transfer.  Amherst is much higher rated than Boston.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Pharmacy courses focus on chemistry, and some math. Take all the chemistry you can get, at the highest level. Take math so that you are completely comfortable with algebra and know a little calculus. Take biochemistry, biology and anatomy and physiology. <br>  <br>  Those courses will give you a very good foundation for your pharmacy studies.|`|JObMHvKGaa	Math.  Make sure that you are skilled up on your math abilities.  You will use it quite often when putting together compounds and measuring out medication.  <br>  <br>  Get some flash cards to start memorizing drug classes and what drugs are in them.  This becomes easier with time, as does anything, but it's always something that pays off if you have an edge.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	OK, go ahead, ask.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	If you are legally certified as "Special Needs" then the law requires that you be given whatever accommodation your special needs certification requires and nothing else.  This usually means extra time completing tests, permission to take a test in a room that is quiet,  or help with note taking. It definitely does NOT mean that you will be allowed to do less work  than the rest of the class. You will still have to do all the work and do it at a level that is acceptable for college standards. The college must have believed that you were capable of this or they would not have admitted you.<br>  <br>  The college is NOT required to have a special teacher for you or be 'nicer'.  Very few college teachers have any special training or experience dealing with Special Needs students, so you cannot expect them to do much for you. I don't mean that they will be mean, but you can't expect them to do anything for you - they are not counselors, or psychologists or therapists. They will do exactly what the Special Needs office tells them to do. Special needs students must complete all the work that is required of other students except, if they are blind or physically disabled, etc so that it is impossible for them to do the regular class assignments, then they must complete equally difficult assignments which are available for someone with that disability.  Do not expect to get any special treatment except exactly what is specifically required by your legal special needs certification. But you do have the right to expect that they will give you everything you are certified to get. If they don't they are in big legal trouble. <br>  <br>  When you get to college, you should immediate register with the Special Needs office - make sure you have all your legal paper work with you - The college is not allowed to give you any special accommodations until after you have registered with the special needs office.<br>  <br>  I had many Special Needs students who did a great job in my class, successfully completed college and went on to have great careers. You can, too.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4a56d562f974d57516297c08233e6970aa	I'm sure they will accomodate your needs. Email them to check what they can do for you.
AA11868793	College and University is basically the same.  After highschool you can either go to a college or university.<br>  <br>  To get a degree you need 4 years of school.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think you are thinking about a Masters degree.  You go to college/university for 4 years and get your bachelors degree.  Then you will go for 1 to 3 years more for your Masters.  That is when you would more likely change schools.  Like if you wanted to be a doctor you would go to one school for your bachelor degree then to a highly ranked school to get your Master degree in medicine.|`|384399ec8f9051dbf8ccafb9621f25edaa	better to go to the collage first and then the university it's seem to me that collages is the first step in making your career to a good start.<br>  just my thought|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	In Britain and some other countries there is a difference between "college" and "university" but in the USA the two words are used interchangeably.  Technically, in the USA, a university is an institution that consists of several colleges - a liberal arts college, an engineering college, a nursing college, etc. with a graduate school that gives Masters and Doctoral level degrees. But in everyday use, the words are used the same in the USA. A kid going off to Harvard University would say that he was "going to college"|`|ATpikCf2aa	You dont need to go to college before you go to a university, acutally they are basically the same thing.  A college offers majors, while a university is separated into different schools(such as Business, Science, and so on) and you get your degree from one of the specific schools.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Elizabeth's mother was a very cagey woman who is often underestimated. After all, her one  goal in life was to get her daughters married, and two of them wound up married to two of the richest and nicest men in England. Would you say she was successful?  If it wasnt for her, Mr Bennet would not have pursued the acquaintance with the neighbors, and if it wasnt for her, the Bingley's wouldn't have connected. She is self centered, hysterical and silly, but she is pretty clever about accomplishing her goals.<br>  <br>  Elizabeth is a nice person. But there is nothing exceptional about her except lack of ambition in marriage - and as she says, her interest in Darcy changes a lot after she sees Pemberley and sees how rich he is.  She repeatedly totally misjudges Darcy... both when she first meets him and later when she is on tour and the letter arrives and she thinks she will never see him again.... So, how smart is that? She can't sing, plays piano middling well and can dance a country dance. That's about the extent of her accomplishments - oh yeah, I forgot her "fine eyes."|`|e514deb9f5e9ca10624452228205c6c6aa	Her mother was not so exceptional - and while initially willing to play the role of society matron, was quick to abandon that in hopes of getting her daughters married off (Jane walking to Netherfield, Lydia's elopment, etc.)<br>  <br>  Lydia cared very little for society's expectations.  If she did, she would not have run off with Wickham.<br>  <br>  Those are basic elements...you'll have to fill in the bulk of the essay on your own with conclusions and evidence from the novel.
fd178ef8de08247b28f20ad40f42c682aa	Research this thoroughly. I was a chemistry major at a college not known for chemistry. The undergrad population was too small, so they threw us in with the grad students. <br>  <br>  Courses had titles like CH-365 / 665 and were extremely difficult for an undergraduate, often using techniques for which the undergrads had not taken classes for yet!<br>  <br>  Not saying Brown is like that, its a larger school than mine was, just do thorough research to find out.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	You should probably be considering Duke instead of Brown.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	When you go to apply to med school no one will care what you did in high school, but they are going to look very closely at what you did in the prerequisite courses - especially organic chemistry. The most important subject for you to get a solid ground in, is chemistry. It is central to all higher level biology, physiology and health sciences. <br>  <br>  Take as much chemistry as you can get, at the highest possible level.|`|c0409627d09f8c2f38561958fd52a476aa	In the end, it's going to make absolutely no difference. High school gets you into college. College gets you into medical school. Medical school gets you into your residency. You're so many steps from the end that you shouldn't be worrying about it. If you've had a chemistry course already, take something else. Same for biology. A&P will be useful only if you know absolutely nothing about your body. I bet your GPA isn't a big issue in terms of getting into college, but if you've had some kind of biology and some kind of chemistry class already, something enjoyable and culturally enriching might be a good choice. Enjoy this year. You'll get chemistry, biology and physics in college, and they'll not be too difficult, so any background in those is likely to make your first year or two in college a little easier and moderately more boring.|`|uGNrXSBvaa	bio ap....what about more math also

AA10926886	I strongly disagree with tne answer above.<br>  <br>  The vast majority of my colleagues (and myself) enjoy teaching, and enjoy our undergraduate students. <br>  <br>  But I believe this question, although poorly phrased, is asking about "belligerent students," not "belligerent professors," so I will answer the question I suspect is being asked.<br>  <br>  Professors love it when annoying students drop, so we can better teach the ones that actually wish to be there.|`|42eccc92ab7fdd2822cae5b80bdd7870aa	Most professors barely register the existence of undergraduates -- especially first year undergraduates.<br>  <br>  Professors are hired to do research; teaching is a duty imposed on them, that many are temperamentally unsuited to, and others find annoying at best. The fact that some claim to enjoy it is somewhat undermined by the many faculty associations that insist that teaching hours NOT be increased. (And, the fact is, most professors have no training whatsoever as educators; possessing a degree, even an advanced one, does not make you a teacher by osmosis.)<br>  <br>  They are often belligerent because they do, in fact, want you to go away.<br>  <br>  People who want to TEACH, are the despised folk you ignored and thought were out to get you back in High School. They cared about you, and wanted you to do well, and some were even upset if students drop their classes (particularly if they now that the student really needs what they are teaching).<br>  <br>  Isn't that ironic?|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	I also strongly disagree with that first answer. I loved my students and I really miss seeing them every week. Over the years I have taught many thousands of students. I must say that I very, very rarely had any student that was "belligerent." When I had a student who was rude in class - which VERY rarely happened - I spoke to them and told them they would be withdrawn from class if they didnt shape up. I think in 40 years I actually threw out maybe three or four students.  <br>  <br>  It is always a little sad to see a student drop a class, because it might mean that you werent doing as good a job as you could do in teaching the class. But nearly always the reason why the student was dropping was something personal and had nothing to do with me. Many, many times a student would drop, or fail, the class and then show up again the next term, usually in the front row with a new attitude.  On the whole I didnt take it personally when a student dropped because I know they sometimes have complicated life issues that took precedence over my class.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Those are respectable schools. You might also consider Wheaton College and Stonehill in MA, and Connecticut College.  And what about RIC, or the MA state colleges like Framingham or Salem. <br>  <br>  If you write to the colleges and tell them that you were unable to complete your applications because of illness, I would be pretty surprised if they refuse to consider you. Most colleges have at least a few empty seats when September rolls around. If you were qualified to get in under the regular admissions process, they will certainly consider adding you to their classes as a late applicant.

He told me he is playing in 8 different musical groups... each group a different genre of music, from Appalachian fiddle tunes, to asian music, to funk, to classical... he plays at least eight solid hours a day or more seven days a week. he loves every minute of it. He was a good player when he left for school, but now he is approaching terrific as everyone pushes each other to get better and better. <br>  <br>  If that sounds appealing to you, practice like crazy and head for Boston and tell them you are desperate to get in! On the other hand, if you want to practice songs with three chords and not bother learning your modes and scales, then forget it.

It is also quite small. There are only about 1500 Freshmen entering each year from about 20,000 of the best students in the world who apply.  Unless you are a very distinguished student your chances of being admitted are not good. <br>  <br>  You need to have very high SAT scores, near perfect in math. You have to have taken the hardest courses your high school provides, especially in chemistry, physics and math. You need to have shown leadership in your extracurriculars - Captain of the competitive math or science team, some kind of science award at the regional or national level. Since many thousands of outstanding American students apply and are rejected each year, only a handful of undergraduates are admitted from around the world... <br>  <br>  But there are many other excellent universities in the USA.... more than 1000 that offer degrees in engineering, and probably 2,500 or more with degrees in math or physics. You need to look further in your search for a school.|`|be5ae492455339da177370250432d23eaa	The answer above is awesome.  The procedure is the same as with other colleges.

You have to be more of a self-starter and self-motivator to stand out from the crowd of premeds.

6ccd9b4a03e61ae4a0b6d27977d16a52aa	Everybody has a chance, and I have heard of students going to universities like Columbia with 3.5's or lower, but it is rare- 3.7 or 3.8 is good for a college GPA.<br>  <br>  You should apply, but understand that your chances are not great.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you study for the SAT (prep books can help- they can at least add 50pts a section).  Try to get >2000 on the SAT's, which would put you on equal footing with most other applicants.  However, with or without a score such as this, still apply knowing that college admissions are simply a case of a weighted crapshoot.<br>  <br>  PS, getting a significantly better SAT score could also land you a good deal of money to lesser schools- trust me.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	I don't think your chances are very good. Columbia is one of the hardest, if not THE hardest, of all American universities to be admitted to. And they allow very, very few transfers... probably no more than 15 - 20 per year from the entire world. <br>  <br>  In addition, Columbia has a very demanding core curriculum which requires a whole series of very tough courses. You would have to take all those courses before you could graduate - I dont think they would accept too many of your CC credits for those courses. <br>  <br>  If you are desperate to get to NYC, why not look at Fordham.

But to really make your future more secure, I would consider going into nursing.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	There are no US universities which award the Bachelor of Medicine. In the USA all medical colleges award the MD except for a few that give the degree of DO (Doctor of Osteopathic medicine) which is basically the same program. <br>  <br>  US medical schools have a four year curriculum and in virtually all cases they require a BA or BS with a set of required (prerequisite) courses that includes one year each of physics, biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemisty and calculus. The prereqs vary from school to school. Admission to US med schools is extremely competitive.

Medicine is science, and in particular, it is chemistry. You have to understand drugs, metabolism, toxins, immunity, contraindications, etc and those are all simply chemistry.  In prerequisites you have to take organic chemistry. Organic is to honors chem as honors chem is to drivers ed.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	1. in the USA you must compelte a BA or BS degree before applying to medical school. <br>  2. At Harvard, Yale and the other elite medical schools, only about 1% of the applicants are accepted. No one applies who isn't very well qualified, so that means that if you are very well qualified your chances of being admitted are 1 in 100. <br>  3. There are very few scholarships at American medical schools. The schools may loan you money, but you have to pay it all back. Since there are thousands of well qualified American students who are being turned away by these schools, the chances of any scholarship or grant being given to a foreign student are extremely small. <br>  4. your idea is not very realistic, I'm afraid. There are 4000 college and university campuses in America. Harvard and Yale are two of the most desired. Many thousands of the best students in the world apply each year and only a small number can be accepted. Both of these schools are rather small - they each take only about 1300 first year students. <br>  If you want to come to school in America you must do much more research about the different schools and how the admissions programs work.  You can definitely come to America for college. That is not difficult. But getting into one of the top schools - that is almost impossible.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	You can major in biology at virtually any college or university in the USA, so the list of top bio schools is the same as the list of top schools in general. Anyone who graduates from Duke, UCHicago, the Ivies, or the top Lib Arts schools such as Amherst, Williams, Davidson, Bowdoin, not to mention the elite state schools such as Michigan, Wisconsin, UNC, UCal, etc with a strong bio degree will have a very good education and be ready to go on to medical, veterinary, healthsciences, or academic biology programs of any kind at any level. <br>  <br>  There are literally hundreds and hundreds of schools that have bio majors.  Majoring in zoology is not such a great idea because if you study only animal biology it will cut you out of many grad programs and jobs where you need more general biology knowledge (say, microbiology) that may not be taught in a zoology major. You would need to check carefully to be sure that a zoology program covered all the general biology bases. <br>  <br>  Try to narrow down your interests - if there is a particular area of bio that you are interested in, why not check with some people who work in that area and see what their recommendations are, rather than shotgunning a question out to Yahoo where the answered are likely to be pretty ignorant and shortsighted. This is not a good place to get advice about such an important decision in your life.|`|JvzIJGkoaa	I would recommend UC Davis' Animal Science major.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	I have to say that I think Woolcat's answer is about as far offbase as any answer I have seen on this topic ever. <br>  <br>  Admission to the Ivies and other very elite schools such as Duke, UChicago, Stanford, etc is not "falling off." (and since when have Duke and Stanford been "second tier?" - not in your lifetime! They are routinely ranked among the best in the world.) On the contrary, recent articles in the NY Times and elsewhere have confirmed that these schools are receiving the highest number of apps they have ever had, and competition to get in is the fiercest it has ever been.<br>  <br>  The misperception that the elite schools are failing may come from a side effect of this competition - the number of high school students applying to college is greater than ever but the elite schools have not increased their class sizes.  If you take the 20 most prestigious schools in the USA and add up the size of their Freshman classes for next fall, it would hardly add up to 30,000 kids, while there are more than 2 million kids entering college. So, there just is not room enough for all the wonderful kids who want to get into to these fabulous schools. That means that second level schools which have always been respectable, are getting the spillover of talent that doesnt fit in the elite schools, and their students are getting to be almost as elite as the top 20. That would mean schools like BC, Fordham, Univ of Richmond, George Washington, Syracuse, Tufts... these excellent schools are now at the same level that elite schools were at 10- 20 years ago, as far as the SAT and GPA scores of their students  -- of course, they still dont have the financial power, faculty and reputations of the most elite schools.  <br>  <br>  Woolcat is definitely way, way off base in suggesting that Columbia, Penn or Brown are anything less than highest level world class schools - that is just plain ignorant!!!  Columbia is probably the hardest  to get into of any elite school - they accepted about 9% of its applicants this year from an applicant pool that had SAT average of well over 1400. This is not the stats of a "falling off" school.<br>  <br>  The problem for a CC student who wants to transfer/enter one of these schools is really a problem of space. If you check the US News data you'll see that for these elite schools, the % of freshmen who return for sophomore year in these schools is very high - usually around 97 -98%.  --  incidentally, that pretty much explains why you shouldn't pay any attention to someone who drops out of one of these schools and then disses it. The way high % of kids who stay and graduate tells how satisfied they are. Also you will note that for these elite schools a very high % of the alumni give to the alumni fund - that is one of the most direct measures of whether people were satisfied with their education. -- so, if they have 1000 kids in the Freshman class and only 2% don't return, that means there are only 20 seats available for all the kids who want to transfer in. One Ivy admissions officer told me they had 400 transfer apps and accepted 25 last year. If the college has an app from a kid from some other high powered school and they know that kid can handle tough courses, then that kid will have an admission advantage over CC kids who may have a high GPA but no one is sure how tough the courses were. <br>  <br>  Also, many of the most elite schools have extensive core curricula, especially Columbia and UChicago are famous for it.  As a transfer student, you would have to play catch up with these course requirements.... many of your CC courses would just not fit the bill.<br>  <br>  You should definitely go on from CC, but it is probably a lot more realistic to pick a high quality state university or one of the top 100 US News schools which is not at the very tiptop of the ladder. Those slightly less than top schools are still terrific, and they have a little more room for incoming kids who are bright and ambitious.|`|3659eea040b36a11ef3b6646d16172acaa	Not Yale exactly, but after I dropped out of Cornell, I spent some time at a local community college, and heard of 1 student being admitted to Cornell from the CC. I think it helped that the school was a 30 minute drive (and probably had a better record of sending 1-2 students/year to the school, because more of them tended to apply).<br>  <br>  As I mentioned though, I dropped out of Cornell. Ivy league professors tend to treat undergraduate students like $h!t. I ended up transferring to RIT which was not as famous, but required more classes in my field, had better professors (ones who were there to teach), learned a lot more than I would have at Cornell, and most importantly was far more happier. <br>  <br>  You might have a long shot at getting in to an Ivy through a community college, but in my experience it is not worth the effort. Whatever your field is, there are going to be schools that are easier to get into where you will have a better experience.|`|AA10019544	About 20 years ago, Yale had a program whereby extremely high IQ high school students were chosen to attend.  I have heard recently that they now have a similar program for needs-based urban high school students.  I have been told that most (but not all) of the Ivy League schools select from a small pool of applicants that include the children of large donors, applicants from specific private (prep) schools, etc.  There has been much discussion about private elementary, grade and high schools in large cities (especially New York) that prepare their students for Ivy League admission from the very first day of First Grade.  So the "quick and dirty" answer to your question is:  No.<br>       But don't despair.  I have heard from several sources that the Ivy League "glamor" has dulled considerably.  Ask yourself the three things you most desperately want form college.  Be brutally honest.  Is it the "campus life?"  Is it because your IQ is so high you need the intellectual stimulation and competition?  Is it because an Ivy League degree means you will achieve your "dream occupation?"  Think again.  In these areas, and many others, many of the Ivy League schools are falling behind.  Which ones?  I don't know - but I personally would not apply to Columbia or Brown or Penn.  Based purely on unsubstantiated hearsay.<br>       You joke about "super achievements" - but you are entirely correct (assuming you have a good high school record).  If you have done ANYTHING requiring a special skill or saved someone's life - make sure the Admissions Office knows about it.  For starters, brush up on your written English ("gotta" is a no-no).  If you feel you are good enough for the Ivy League, why not try some "second tier" colleges which are as good (usually better) than the Ivys - such as Duke, William and Mary, Stanford, etc.  Or smaller schools with fantastic reputations, such as Washington and Lee, Hamilton and others?

Don't depend on any advice you get on Yahoo.... the people here often make mistakes in answering questions of this kind. <br>  <br>  The USA has an aging population, but that population has a lot of money. They will be some good opportunities to be a health science professional in the USA in the future. But you MUST be certified and a legal resident or you cannot receive payments....  It is worth doing a lot more research....  <br>  <br>  Good luck.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Carbon dioxide is produced by living things when they metabolize. <br>  <br>  In general, plants capture much more CO2 than they produce.They combine it with water in the process of photosynthesis to produce glucose. So plants remove Carbon dioxide, rather than produce it. <br>  <br>  So, I think there is some mistake here about what you are asking.<br>  <br>  However, carbon dioxide can weather rocks. When carbon dioxide is in the air it can dissolve in water. Then it is in the form known as carbonic acid H2CO3. This is a weak acid which can dissolve some kinds of rocks, in particular, limestone/marble.  These days the rocks are much more likely to be weathered by Sulfuric acid. That comes in "acid rain." The acid rain is formed when coal is burned, mainly for generating electricity.  Coal is mostly carbon, so when it is burned it makes carbon dioxide. But coal also contains a mixture of other materials, especially sulfur. When coal containing sulfur is burned the sulfur becomes sulfur dioxide, SO2. The sulfur dioxide mixes with water in the air to become H2SO3 or H2SO4. That is a much more powerful acid which can rapidly dissolve limestone rocks.  In Europe and the eastern US there are lots of places where you can see this. For instance, if you go to an old cemetery in the eastern US there are thousands of old white gravestones from the 1800s and early 1900s which are seriously worn away in just 100 years as a result of this.  Because of the tremendous damage that acid rain causes, we have spent a lot of money in various systems that try to remove the acid from the coal smoke. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps.

To become a pediatrician you must first earn a Bachelor's degree which includes all the prerequisites for medical school, then you must attend medical school for four years, then you apply to be trained as a pediatrician after you have completed your MD degree. <br>  <br>  Medical schools are quite expensive and there are few scholarships, but it is possible to borrow the costs of med school. You will get out of med school owing many tens of thousands of dollars, but since you are a physician, you will get a good salary and be able to pay off the loans.  It would not be unusual for a new MD to owe $200,000 in school loans when she first gets out of medical school. <br>  <br>  Learn more about medical schools by googling the website of the Association of American Medical Colleges AAMC
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	You really have this backwards. The real question is, should a person be allowed to pick a specific subject to study as a major before they have received enough general education to be able read, write, spell, do critical analysis, use logic, distinguish properly between common grammatical forms such as 'you're' instead of 'your', "canon" instead of "cannon", etc.<br>  <br>  College is not trade school. College graduates are, still, supposed to be educated. You get a Bachelor of Arts, not a Bachelor of Accounting or a Bachelor of Biology. <br>  <br>  The most respected colleges in America mostly have rather strict and difficult core curricula that have to be mastered before the students can complete their majors. Two of the most famous examples are Columbia and University of Chicago, but Harvard, Duke and almost all of the rest of the elite schools more or less follow suit, with only a couple of exceptions.<br>  <br>  IT has been argued quite a lot recently that because technology and society in general are changing so fast, that trying to teach specific job skills is a waste of time - what is needed is to teach students only general courses such as logic, math, physics, chemistry, rhetoric, etc. Once they learn to think, read and write clearly, then being trained for a job is trivial.|`|5Nmtjrhraa	well, I'm not an accounting major but i will tell you this.  you need to take stupid GE courses which is pretty much a waste of time i mean some classes. my major is in medical field but i took or i am finally done with those GE courses after this Thursday final. point is yes you need to take classes that doesn't count towards your major for your freshman and sophomore year. once you are done, then you are on your own. which means you'll get in to you're major and take only your major classes.  Good luck!
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The U of P is not a well respected school. Your degree from there, although it may be "accredited" is regarded as of very low quality. <br>  <br>  You could validate yourself by going to a respected bricks and mortar college for your MA or MS. If you graduated at the Masters level from a well respected state or private college, then it would go a long way toward removing any stigma that your U of P degree gives you. Continuing on at U of P would just verify everyone's opinion that you couldn't really "make it" in the real academic world and/or that you aren't dedicated to your field, but are just trying to pick up some cheap credentials...<br>  <br>  I thinkyou might be accepted at many MS or MA programs, but they will probably be watching carefully to see whether you really have the chops or not.

If you had an academic problem they might give you another chance, but no one wants to take on someone whose behavior was so outrageous that they had to be thrown out of school. <br>  <br>  You are going to have to go to some last-resort school for a year and have a squeaky-clean record while you are there. Then maybe you can transfer to somewhere more prestigious.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, you must be 100% well behaved from now on or your academic life is over for many years.|`|AA11556947	yes you can. but you should talk to an admission representive about this. but you would probably have to enroll in a community college until your disciplinary time was up since they'll accept you almost no matter what you did.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Being a pharmacist is a great career. But because the jobs are interesting and very highly paid, you will have to beat a LOT of competition to get a space.  Our local paper had an article that said that starting pharmacists from our state u. were averaging $90K to start, but that there were 1000 applicants for 90 seats and the applicants had the best qualifications of any group applying to the u.  even better than premeds. <br>  <br>  YOu need to start right now working seriously on your preparation for pharm school. Take a look at the website of the Association of American Colleges of Pharmacy. They have links to every accredited school of pharmacy int he USA. You can pick out some schools near you and check their websites for exact details about their programs.  You need to go through these websites line by line. When you get to college, immediately go see the Health Science advisor or Pre-pharmacy advisor to be sure that you are doing everything you need to do to get into pharm school. <br>  <br>  Pharmacy requires excellent chemistry skills, so the more chemistry you take, and the more seriously you study it, the better off you will be. The real stumbling block for kids who are trying to get into pharm schools is organic chemistry. You need a B+ or preferably an A in organic. It is a very tough course, so the better you prepare for it, the better your chances of getting into pharm school. <br>  <br>  I don't think it matters much which pharm school you go to. There are a few rankings but no one takes them too seriously. All the pharm schools are good. They all have to teach pretty much the same thing because after graduation all the grads have to take the national licensing exam, so they all have to know the same material.  Once you are a pharmacist it really doesnt make much difference where you got your degree. <br>  <br>  Check out that AACP website and go for it. Good luck.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Based on TV I think that your main skills for this job would be dressing well, spending a lot of time at the toning gym and learning to talk back to your superiors. <br>  <br>  Based on the work I did with the state lab, I would say the main skills you need are a tenacious patience in working with really bad smelling and amazingly gross specimens that would - I'm not kidding - make most people puke up their guts.  You have to have a high tolerance for semen, blood, saliva and intestinal contents. <br>  <br>  Also, you have to be the kind of person who is obsessively meticulous about labelling and handling everything. If you ever had a messy room, then you are probably not the right person for a crime lab. One mistake and a rapist or murderer goes free. <br>  <br>  A Forensic technician is going to working for a pathologist. They are the geekiest of all doctors. The ones who never see patients but just sit in their lab office all day examining body parts. Most of the pathologists I've known were incredibly brilliant geniuses and also total nerds.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Lots of  people take science courses in college, and even major in science, but most of them do not become "scientists."<br>  <br>  To become a professional scientist you will probably have to get at least an MS or probably a PhD in an area of science. Getting a PhD in science would take about ten years after high school and you would have to take about 40 -50 different courses in science, including math. <br>  <br>  Virtually all scientists have to know chemistry - it is sometimes called "the central science" because it is necessary for understanding everything in biology, geology, agriculture, medicine, etc.  Also, to do well in chemistry and to understand the results of your experiments, you need to know algebra and statistics. In many areas of science it is important to know calculus. So, math is really important. <br>  <br>  What really makes the difference between just studying science and being a scientist is, how good are you at problem solving?  Scientists spend all day trying to figure out about how the world works. If you are not good at puzzles and solving word problems, and making up word problems, then you would probably not be a very productive scientist.|`|AA11442094	Chemistry, physics, Algebra, Statistics and or biology, astonomy.

You get an idea (theory),<br>  decide which things mean that it is right or not, set up and experiment to test it, use a control that is an old way of doing things (to compare to your way), write down observations (data), and use the data and math (statistics and more) to see whether your idea seems to work.<br>  Other scientists look at what you have done, and how you did it, and try to repeat it themselves. This is "peer review." If they can, and things make sense to them, they agree with you. If not, they say that you are wrong, or that the idea needs more work.<br>  This is the scientific method.

I know LOTS of fabulously talented musicians my age who have no retirement money, no health care benefits, have never owned their own home, are driving around in ten year old cars. I feel very upset when I see them. And one of the worst things is they have rarely had any artistic freedom. I play exactly the music I love. They play the music people hire them to play. <br>  <br>  You need to have a marketable skill. I don't see why you have to limit yourself to civil engineering. If you are good at math (which you would have to be, to major in Engineering) why not consider teaching math? The course work is very much easier, and you have a lot more time off once you get settled in your career. You can make a decent living, and have fun with the kids, and have lots of time for your hobby.

In some of the elite schools like Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Columbia, Duke or U Chicago there are thousands of applicants for only 150 - 200  seats each year.<br>  <br>  The competition means that the schools must look very carefully at the credentials of the applicants. Certainly you cannot get into med school without very good marks in all the prerequisite classes such as chemistry, calculus, biochem, organic chem, etc. And you must have a very good score on the MCAT exam.  You must demonstrate that you are committed to a life in the health sciences by doing a lot of volunteer work in health care settings and/or research labs.<br>  <br>  You need really good recommendations from your undergrad faculty and volunteer supervisors. <br>  <br>  If you have all these credentials then you have a fighting chance of being one of the lucky ones who gets admitted to med school.|`|GSQF1isTaa	Every med school has its own set of criteria for selecting candidates.

Read the fine prints.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Most schools have a requirement that you must submit transcripts rom each school that you have attended since leaving high school.

Each of them has outstanding faculty and resources, but the question is really not a meaningful one, since the chances that an international student can be accepted as a freshman undergraduate in any of these elite schools is very small.<br>  <br>  Columbia, in particular, is extremely selective. You literally have to be one of the very best students in the USA to be admitted there. But Brown, Stanford and UCB are also very selective.  I personally know an American student with a 2280 SAT, 4+ GPA, and many extracurriculars including a silver medal at a US national science competition who was turned down by Brown and Columbia.  And I know one Asian student who was accepted at Columbia. He had 2400 SAT and won a very important US national science competition for a research project he published as a Jr in high school.  These are not schools where ordinary kids get in. <br>  <br>  If you are not capable of opening an atlas, or using the internet to check the size, climate, and cultural attributes of these schools and their communities, then there is literally no chance you will ever be a student there.<br>  <br>  Try first deciding what area of the USA you would be interested in visiting. Then use the college search program at princetonreview.com to select some schools that are in that area and which  match with your financial strength and academic credentials. <br>  <br>  There are over 4000 colleges in the USA. You can definitely find one that will match your credentials, if you can afford to attend. Over 500,000 international students study in the USA each year.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	1. they are not the same thing, but they are closely related. In the USA the term "college" refers to post secondary education (after  graduation from high school).  Community colleges provide the first two years of post secondary courses. You can receive an "Associates" degree at the end of two years and then choose whether to leave school or to go on to finish a four year degree at a "Bachelors" level college. A university is an institution that offers "Bachelors" and higher level degrees such as "Masters" or "Doctorate"<br>  <br>  It is NOT true that Community College is glorified high school. The CCs were established to help students who could not afford to go to a four year college, or to provide local courses for students who could not travel to stay at a four year college, or for other reasons. In many states the community colleges teach the same courses and use the same curriculum as the state universities, and you can directly transfer credits from CC to the four year college if you decide to go on. <br>  <br>  2, you can go to CC with a GED. Also, many colleges will accept a GED for regular admission to a four year Bachelors degree program. <br>  <br>  CCs are a good way to start college if you have financial limitations, have been out of school for a while and need to get back in the habit of school, or have some other limitation. You should go to your local CC and talk tot he admissions counselor. They are used to dealing with GED students and will be able to tell you exactly how to apply, and how to move on from the CC to the state university after you finish.<br>  <br>  You can do this.

If she is not independent enough and ambitious enough to search this subject out for herself, and if she does not want to do it herself, then how is she going to manage all the little problems of living and studying in a foreign country. <br>  <br>  If she really wants to come to the USA, a way to begin would be to decide what part of the US she wants to live in, and then use the college search programs at princetonreview.com or the college board to find some schools in that area. Then she can read the websites of those schools in detail and decide which one is best for her.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

You walk directly out of your dorm into a city street. The classroom buildings, library, etc are just large city buildings on a city street. <br>  <br>  Columbia is a few miles uptown. It is an urban setting, but more of a residential type area with four or five story apt buildings and retail stores, etc around it. The university has a central campus, although it is quite small - but it does have a couple of very small lawns where kids play frisbee sometimes. The dorms are around the periperhery of the campus so you walk out of your dorm into the middle space. It is concrete mostly, but at least it is a university open space. The main library has a big wide set of stone steps and the kids hang out there - they call it the "urban beach."<br>  <br>  The only really nice campus in NYC is Fordham U. which is about 2 or 3 miles north of Columbia. They have a lot of green space, trees, and separated building surrounding by grassy areas. It is much more like a suburban campus, but you can still hop a subway and be downtown in a little while.

w5O4Abpvaa	I can't imagine why anyone would "abuse" you for teaching your child....that's part of being a parent.<br>  <br>  As a public school teacher for 11 years, I pray for parents to take an interest and teach their children the things we don't have time for during our school day. <br>  <br>  Most of my curriculum is mandated by the state. For example, the topics I teach in science and social studies are layed out for me...I can't teach my students about plants...that is done at another grade level. So, if I have a student who is really interested in a certain topic, I help him/her find resources...books, professionals, websites, locations to visit, etc <br>  <br>  Any true educator will work with you to help you meet the needs of your child. As an educator my prayer is that I leave my students with a burning desire to be life-long learners and resources and confidence to seek the knowledge they desire.<br>  <br>  I have three children and I teach them at home every chance I get...technology for example is something that we have little time for during the school day. When my kids want to know how to do something I will either teach them (if I know) or we will set about to learn together (since there are many things that I want to know too)<br>  <br>  Keep teaching your daughter. Instill in her the tools and confidence to constantly seek knowledge everywhere in her world. People that think learning is just for schools have little understanding of life and of children! Schools are just a small part of the picture, one of many tools that are needed!<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|lLdcFjdvaa	I have been "after schooling" my kids since they started school.  Last year I just pulled one daughter out and it went so well, All three (school age) will be home next year for school.<br>  I would teach what they needed help in or what they are good at and needed to proceed in (I have 2 advanced students).<br>  The schools in my area are good, but they still tend to teach to the middle levels and teach the tests.
d76180f8e5e8037c32c390c552012bb1aa	Northwestern states that it is need-blind for admissions and meet 100% of all citizens' and permanent residents' financial needs. Did Northwestern meet your financial needs? If it didn't offer you financial aid, then it probably meant that you didn't require need-based financial aid. If you are a citizen or permanent resident and really need need-based financial aid, then you should talk to Northwestern about it.|`|e8bc6430cb02150fa068330518f38015aa	Erg... probably not.  You are at a top school, thinking about applying to another top school, which will be A LOT more expensive.  If you are in-state in California, then tuition at Northwestern will be thrice that of UCLA.<br>  <br>  I'm sure I know what the problem is... lack of a business degree that says "I'M A BUSINESS STUDENT, HIRE ME!  HIRE ME!" Right?  If so, don't worry... employers are still hiring Econ majors for investment banks and consulting jobs, especially out of UCLA.<br>  <br>  Northwestern's a great school, don't get me wrong... but if you can afford to go to UCLA, then think about how much longer it will take to pay back the $75,000 difference in tuition from 3 years of school.  scary...|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	I don't get it.

They are not particularly noted for their Econ dept - as opposed to say, U Chicago, which is probably the best in the world...<br>  <br>  I agree with the other answer.

Even though UCLA does not have the national reputation of some other schools, it is very respectable and no one will look down on you for having graduated from UCLA with a high GPA degree.

Instead, you must get in to Medical College, then after you graduate with your MD degree and are a qualified physician, then you do a residency to study dermatology. That can take 3 years or more after the MD. <br>  <br>  To get into Med College you need a Bachelor's degree with all the completed prerequisites and a high GPA and also a high score onthe MCAT exams (like SAT only much harder).<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|73d669cc41621c10f2ea9d8a5d0e8a6baa	Medical schools.
ytz38apzaa	hi,first of all congrats on such a good percentage. <br>  I know at this step most of the students get confused,it was the same case with me in my time.<br>  but percentage doesn't really matter,if you need a free seat in any college. you got a 347 rank (girls)in UPTU you can get JSS, Galgotia's , KITE .these are not govenrment colleges but they are quite famous ones.I myself is a passout of galgotia's.<br>  About IIT one can never be sure till the end time. <br>  and you can get admission in IP too,but not in gvt. college ,same in AIEEE<br>  I'm not sure,that you can get a government college. But you can surely get a good private college,in UPTU.<br>  What i suggest you is to take up with a good pvt.college like JSS or Galgotia cause they have nice placements these days.It is the placement which really matters .<br>  All the best for your future.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Columbia is an urban university in the heart of the city. They have a very demanding core curriculum.  Cornell is a rural university in a remote small town. Their curriculum is demanding but not rigid. <br>  <br>  What are you trying to get from your college experience? Maybe you should decide what KIND of college you want to attend and then make decisions based on that.... if you like the idea of a more self-contained school you could look at Duke, Dartmouth, Middlebury or other rural schools. Or if you are focused on being in a city, then Harvard, Brown and Penn are more logical alternatives to Columbia - actually its best match would probably be U of Chicago. <br>  <br>  Decide what you want first, then choose the schools. <br>  <br>  Obviously, no one is getting into any of these schools without excellent academic credentials. And, you need to have a hook - something that is special and different about you. The two kids I know who got into Columbia this year had each won a major national award - one in languages and one in science. And one kid I know who got turned down at Columbia had a Silver medal from National Science Olympiad and had terrific other credentials besides. It's clear that they are taking only the best of the best. <br>  <br>  Good luck, but think first about what you really are aiming at.|`|7ca44a3727786e789f15a19554574c39aa	Apply<br>  <br>  They only have so many openings and only take the cream of the crop.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	To get into med school you need to take all the college prerequisites that your med school requires. That probably means chemistry, biochem, organic chem, calculus, physics and bio. <br>  <br>  So, the more prep you have in all these topics, the better off you will be in college. When you get to college chemistry a lot of the premed kids in your class will already have taken honors chem and AP chem in high school, so you will have to compete against them for the grades that the Med School admissions committee will see. Now is the time, in high school, for you to take these courses and get a really solid foundation in math and chemistry. <br>  <br>  Once you are in college it is all about preparing for the MCAT exams. They count a lot in med school admissions.  So, as soon as you get to college you have to hook up with the premed advisor and do everything she or he tells you. <br>  <br>  Pediatrics is a medical specialty. That means you do not study it until after you graduate from med school. You first must graduate with your MD, then you do a residency for 3 - 5 years studying pediatrics. <br>  <br>  You can't worry about whether there is a school near you. You must go wherever in the US (or even abroad) that you can get into a med school. <br>  <br>  This is a long, hard process, but it is very rewarding in the end. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|b1bf60cc45be5319a0f59716961d792caa	i just graduated from high school and im going into premed and then medschool so i kinda know about it.. but there is the university of northen colorado at denver which is really good in medicine.. good luck!

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	This is not "urgent."  Especially if you are planning to attend a large university or a small school that gives liberal arts degrees. <br>  <br>  I don't mean that it's not important. I mean, there is no rush. <br>  <br>  In many colleges you are not even ALLOWED to choose your major until the end of your 1st year, or even your 2nd year. <br>  <br>  So, relax, focus on choosing a university or college where you think you will have an interesting experience, and spend some time thinking about what things you might like to try out a little before you settle on one general area. <br>  <br>  Even then, you might major in English or History or Sociology or some other kind of general area. Then after you graduate there are lots of different directions you can follow. Unless you want to be an Engineer or Nurse or learn some kind of special technical skill , then there is no need for you to get all stressed out at this point. <br>  <br>  Some kids might tell you that they have their college plans all figured out. Wrong. More than half of all kids who declare a major when they start college actually wind up getting a degree in something else. <br>  <br>  That's what college is for, to give you the opportunity to figure out what is right for you.|`|H2jmEihlaa	Do what your heart desires.

8YYwdccpaa	Most of them will take you. Be honest in talking to the admissions counselor at the community college so he/she can help you.<br>  <br>  If it makes you feel better, I have had students who were academically dismissed. They went to community college--where they got their act together and got their gpa up--and then they petitioned to come back to university. They did okay the next time, so there is always hope.<br>  <br>  BUT. . . . the first thing you need to do is be honest with yourself. WHY did you have problems at university? Did you goof off? Are you not mature enough to be ready to succeed in school? Were you in the wrong major and it didn't fit you well? Was it a tough school and you realistically aren't up to the necessary level to succeed? Were you working too many hours and you didn't keep up with school responsibilities? Substance abuse? <br>  <br>  If you can't answer that question, you probably shouldn't be going to the community college either because you run the risk of repeating the problem. There's no law that says you have to be in school right now. For some people, waiting a year or two can make a huge difference.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|44b4fdd7ed7cc42e599ec8a9302e9632aa	You'd have to ask them if they will take you.|`|14862b67882828fab3ba7c7656625275aa	Wow, what did u do?|`|zxj7ot9Taa	community colleges take students who at least has their high school diploma/ GED....so u should be fine.

Nowadays that is no longer the case.<br>  <br>  Many schools now offer undergraduate degrees in pharmacy a BSPS. I know of two in Ohio that due Ohio State and University of Toledo. They both offer "accelerated" programs where your BSPS and Pharm D are combined 6 or 7 year programs. Unfortunately at some schools like The University of Toledo if you aren't in their "accelerated" program your Pharm D is going to take 5 years instead of 4. For whatever reason UT decides to set you back a year when you enter.<br>  <br>  You must remember that pharmacy is one of the most difficult programs to enter into.

They have links to every accredited pharm school in the USA arranged by states.<br>  <br>  The point of a prepharm BS is that you are well prepared to enter and succeed at the College of Pharmacy. In the USA now all pharm schools give the Doctor of Pharmacy degree (PharmD). You must have this degree to become a pharmacist in the USA today.  Some schools require a BS before you enter, and others only require that you take at least two years of college and do well in the prerequisite courses. Most of the the schools that require only two years are currently changing over to require a BS, so in a few years that will be the standard everywhere. <br>  <br>  Pharm school is getting very competitive. In our local state university the prepharm students have a higher average GPA than the premeds.

If you are admitted you are going to get a terrific education!|`|22a759e0a73efeb1e5bb61d22b2fff81aa	Why not?
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Talk to your high school guidance counselor. And check the ASU website. They probably have a place on the website where you can enter your name to get more information. Once you sign up then they will send you every pamphlet and brochure they have.  <br>  <br>  There is nothing the matter with ASU if you dont mind going to a huge school where you will be surrounded by concrete and take classes with hundreds of other kids at a time.  They have some pretty exciting sporting events there sometimes. My cousin went there and he is a pretty good guy except that he has been unemployed most of his life because of the drinking habit he picked up there. '<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11149006	Go to their website and see what their deadlines are.  Most colleges and universities visit big college fairs, so plan on attending a college fair to see all your options and talk to admission reps.
tgLRdBS6aa	You can also look at Rutgers in NJ.|`|AA10034577	Oregon State University has the best.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	In the USA all pharmacy schools are graduate programs that award the degree Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm D). To get into these programs some colleges require a completed BS and other programs require only that you have completed at least two years of college with excellent grades and top grades in chemistry, organic and biochem, physics and math and biology.  Many schools require that you complete the PCAT examination. <br>  <br>  Admission to pharmacy schools is very competitive, almost as hard as med school admissions in some cases.  There are only about 100 colleges of pharmacy in the USA. You can check them out at the Association of American Colleges of Pharmacy website AACP.  THey have links to the websites of every US accredited college of pharmacy, arranged by state. <br>  <br>  This is a great career, but very competitive, so you will need to work hard. Good luck.|`|e9LUnuLeaa	Honestly,right now it doesn't really which pharmacy school you graduate from.  The job opportunities will be pretty much the same.  I don't believe that Penn State has a PharmD program.  The University of Pittsburgh, Philidelphia College of Pharmacy, and Temple University are all in Pennsylvania and all have good pharmacy schools.  Also in the tri-state area are, Rutgers in NJ, and St. Johns, LIU, Albany school of Pharmacy, and SUNY Buffalo all in NY.  There are a few different lists floating around that rank the pharmacy schools.  Most of them put the University of California San Fransisco at the top, but once again it doesn't really matter which school you go to as long as you graduate and get your PharmD.  If you want to work in Industry, Rutgers might give you a little bit of an edge because most of the drug companies are located in NJ and they have affiliations with the school.  Some schools require you to have taken the PCAT exam before you apply.  I know that Rutgers prefers it but doesn't require it; I'm not sure about the other schools.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	If you "just take the MCAT" after having been out of school for ten years, you will be slaughtered. There is no way for you to get a decent score without MAJOR review, probably taking physics and organic chem over again.... <br>  <br>  You could start by taking an MCAT review course. These are pricey but many of the premed students take them because getting a decent MCAT score is absolutely vital.  Taking the review would help you spot where your weak points are. Then you could study up, and take it again in a year or two. <br>  <br>  It is not necessarily a bad thing that you have been out of school. The med schools seem to like the idea of some time off after college to mature. But you will have to totally convince them that you can handle the firehose system of learning that occurs in the first two years of med school. <br>  <br>  There is a lot of info about med school appls on the website of the American Association of Medical Colleges AAMC. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA12365613	Prerequisites have likely changed since you were in college. Med schools today require 1 year of Bio, 1 year of physics, 1 year of Gen Chem, 1 year of Organic Chem, and 1 year of math as well as your MCAT. Be sure that you have all of these covered or at least be enrolled in these classes before applying.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	MIT has a very detailed website that explains all the details of how to apply.You can check it out. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mit.edu" rel="nofollow">http://www.mit.edu</a><br>  <br>  You should realize that MIT is quite small. The entering freshman class will only be about 1500 students each year. Over 10,000 of the very best students in American apply each year, so if you were a well qualified US student your chance of admission would be no more than about one in 10.  There are only a handful of international students admitted each year - about 100 from the whole world -  so unless you are among the very best students in India, there is basically no chance that you can go to MIT as an undergraduate. <br>  <br>  In the USA there are more than 4000 universities. Many of them are excellent. You can check the US News rankings, and the college search programs at princetonreview.com or collegeboard.com  to get some ideas about other great schools to apply for. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|be5ae492455339da177370250432d23eaa	The previous poster has it right. In addition, admissions are rigorous for international students. The bar is set higher and there is a sort of quota.
AA10926886	UVM by far.<br>  <br>  UVM is considered a "Public Ivy."  It's that good.<br>  <br>  U Mass is just an average state college.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	There is not enough difference in the reputations of these two schools to really affect your decision. You should visit the campuses, see where you feel more comfortable, and consider the financial aspects. After that, choose one of them and dont worry about it. You can get a decent education at either of these schools if you apply yourself in a business like way. <br>  <br>  Good luck.
dtMY9cByaa	That is what I want to do! I love medicine and little kids!|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Pediatrics is a medical specialty. In medical school you do not specialize. You must first get your MD degree and then do a residency in pediatrics after you graduate from med school. <br>  <br>  To learn more about med schools and how medical education works, check the website of the Association of American Medical Colleges AAMC online.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	I think you are DEFINITELY asking this question in the wrong place. <br>  <br>  First, I would try to find out if there is a society or club or organization in Malaysia for amateur or professional astronomers. How many professionals can there be? It must be not more than a few hundred at the very most.

You wouldn't get to specilize in Peds until you are in OT school and then only if you have a big childrens hospital nearby that you could train at. Otherwise you will have to wait until you graduate and just look for peds jobs.|`|6fMJn3mraa	you are going to want to start out with your science courses.  It would be a good idea for your first semester to probably take General Chemistry 1 and Biology 1.  That way you can start moving up quickly in the science courses.  Community College is a smart path to go down but treat it like a 4 year university!  Shoot for straight A's and take the most  amount of hard courses you can handle in a semester.  Don't worry about getting an assiociates degree and taking too many useless gen. ed classes that many CC students tend to take.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	well, my brother in law is a surgeon and one of my sons is studying to be a surgeon. They are both total workaholics and have been as long as I have known them... if you are not that kind of a personality type then surgery might be a bad choice.<br>  <br>  My brother in law makes a HUGE amount of money... he has a very dedicated wife and four kids - two adopted.  He leaves the house at five AM every day and comes home at seven or eight pm. At least now that he is a real surgeon he doesnt spend all day every weekend at the hospital like he did when he was in training - he usually just goes in for three or four hours. <br>  <br>  Being a surgeon means that you are literally holding someone's life in your hands every day all day. If you are not totally dedicated, then this is not a good career choice. But for these two guys, it is the way that they want to live. They wouldn't have it any other way.

If it is a pre-med program, you should just do it--you can still pick any major you want.  <br>  <br>  There's not any one major that is best for getting into medical school.  However, doing a Chemistry or a Biology major might be helpful--at least you are learning a lot of the science that is on the MCAT if you pick one of those majors.

AAMC. They have detailed information about this. <br>  <br>  The short answer is, very few schools have a "premed" major, and it is not required for med school. The large majority of med school students majored in biology or chemistry when they were doing their BA or BS degree.  To get into med school you need about a 3.4 to 3.7 GPA in your science courses. You need to get about a 28 to 30 or better on your MCAT exam. The MCAT exam requires an excellent knowledge of physics, chem, bio and math. In addition there are some other things that med schools look for. When you are at college the Premed Advisor will work with you to be sure that you are creating a good resume that will make you look good to the med schools. <br>  <br>  Each year about 40,000 kids with excellent resumes apply to med school in the USA and about 18,000 of them are accepted. <br>  <br>  It is a tough challenge, but those 18,000 kids have met the challenge and will become MDs.

JFxSJdHoaa	History will most likely be part of your GE (general education) so it comes down to whether you want to get history out of the way now or deal with it later. If you can score high enough on your AP exam so that you won't have to take it in college, then you should do it now.<br>  <br>  As for other AP classes, I do not recommend taking AP Biology in high school even if you're going pre-med because they have to cram a year's worth of college material in less than a high school year.

Not all Uni's do this though, the one I work for currently won't accept applicants that way.  I have worked in 2 Uni's prior to this and they did accept people that way.  There are penalties a Uni pays if the applicants don't go through UCAS, so most ask that you apply direct through UCAS.  It also checks for the odd fake application.|`|9z7k8HCXaa	No you do not actually. I Simply phoned up my university last August to see if there where any places left on the course. There where and I am studying at UWE at the moment.<br>       I had a brief chat with the department head on the phone and 3 days later I had a letter of acceptance through the post. I signed this and returned it and 2 weeks later I was a fully enrolled member of the student classes. At no point did I bother with ucas.<br>       All I needed from the University was a student number to obtain my grant (plus my private details and circumstance).<br>  <br>  The question was simply "Do I need to apply through UCAS to apply for uni" <br>            As stated in my answer 'No You do not need to apply through UCAS' regardless of what internal mechanisms the university uses to sort this out, the applicant need not be concerned.<br>      I am currently on a 4 year full time degree course.

5sZB0DkHaa	No, it doesn't matter, and it won't hurt your chances of getting into college. But if you plagiarize in college, you will be seriously screwed. Many professors will fail you and you would most likely get expelled from the college. And that will follow you through the rest of your college career.

In college, what happens depends on the school, the professor and etc., but I've seen kids get expelled for plagarizing. At best, you'll fail the assignment, or the class. So don't do that in college. |`|a0cb768a2bcdc7a915356d5a5db75704aa	Try and talk to the teacher, tell them you've learned your lesson and that you don't want one thing to ruin your 4 years of hard work.|`|RQenZnjmaa	Plagiarizing is a serious offence. I would ask the teacher about it. Because it's your first time (being caught, you sneaky devil), they may let you slide. But don't do it in college.

73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	The entire world is in an economic recession, and each country has felt its devastating and disheartening effects. Money has become tighter, jobs fewer, and food prices have gone up considerably. The current financial slowdown has probably prompted many a shopper to think twice about buying a new Ipod, and many more to forego a purchase of that nature altogether. However, as citizens of an astoundingly wealthy, industrialized nation, if we believe that our current situation is disappointingly inopportune, then we would be mistaken. Not only would we be mistaken, we would also be extremely foolish to lament over our petty woes when millions of people in developing countries live--and often die-- in a state of perpetual poverty, under deplorable conditions.|`|M0qoqvJbaa	Do your own homework.

Future is particularly bright with advanced nursing degrees which are filling the gaps of where physicians have traditionally served.  Pay is great and you do NOT have to go to a top school. Simply go to any regular state school on the cheap, graduate, and be making 50k+ your first year.  Unlike being a physician, no crazy six figure loans to repay, and your earning potential jumps up as high as any internal medicine physician.<br>  <br>  Accounting -- There's already so much bureaucracy out there and that will continue to increase into the future for the next four years under the current president.

But even if you aren't talented, you can always find work as a general resident IT expert within a small firm paying 40k+.|`|UxooffHZaa	You should ultimately find a career (and a major) that inspires you. Yes, take into account what you guess the market trends will demand, but it's hard to say now. I suggest entering college "undecided" and deciding during your first year, when you take a wide array of subjects. While job prospects are never great (pay wise) for teachers or librarians, you may find this is what you're called to do with your life. It's better to be poorer and happy, than realize how unhappy you are when you're in your 40s. You can always go on to earn an MBA or JD if your undergraduate major (and career choice) isn't what you want.<br>  All this said, while CIS (Computer Information Systems) has taken a hit recently, I think job prospects should be pretty good in 4 years. Any Engineering field should do well if Obama's "Green Economy" comes into fruition. (Mechanical Engineers to build wind turbines, Civil Engineers to build roads, Electrical Engineers to improve Solar Panels, Chemical Engineers to improve Battery technologies, etc) Also Math degrees will always be in demand. (Statistics to Finance to Actuary Sciences) Finally, anything in the Medical field has been doing well for the past 4 years, and very well may be doing good 4 years from now.

COCqpDcfaa	Ahem. Crispus Attucks was the leader of the mob who attacked the British soldiers. He was one of the first to get killed. The British soldiers killed 3 colonists and 2 died later on. <br>  <br>  There isn't much history on Crispus Attucks however, we don't even know if he was African-American! I would say that your textbook is correct.<br>  <br>  |`|fy3MwIkbaa	They're both true depending on how much detail you want to go into.  It's likes saying "Joe Schmoe and six other astronauts landed on Mars" vs. "Seven astronauts landed on Mars".  They're both just as true.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	I'm confused. The book says five, and the workbook says four plus one more. That would be five, right? So what's the problem?<br>  <br>  Attucks was nobody important. He was just a thug in the crowd. If you read a bit further you will find out that the soldiers who killed these five "bystanders" (actually they were thugs who had attacked the soldiers) were put on trial for murder. The soldiers were defended by a local attorney,  John Adams (later the President of the USA). Despite the strong anti-British feeling in the town, a jury of  townspeople found the soldiers innocent of all charges and they were released. |`|fFnsJ7maaa	They are both true. Crispus Attucks was just an African American sailor until he died in the Massacre. Not much is known about him prior to the event. He wasn't important through his own merits, but because he was the first martyr to the revolution. Abolitionists picked up his story to further their own causes. <br>  <br>  So 5 colonists died, Attucks and four others. They are both true. 
RMPJOS6jaa	You're right to be concerned.  A 3.0 GPA isn't going to make you competitive.  A high MCAT score might make an admission committee look at your application, but there are going to be many applicants with high MCATS and very competitive GPAs, so you need to repair your GPA.<br>  <br>  Taking additional courses isn't the solution.  The AdComs judge all applicants (even those with advanced degrees) on the same criteria:  overall GPA, the GPA in the prereqs and the MCAT scores.  You need to repeat the courses that are dropping your GPA.  Repeating courses is not viewed negatively by AdComs (most medical school applicants do repeat courses and an increasing number of medical school web sites advise applicants to repeat courses.|`|XKhNw221aa	Organic Chem is a must. Most Bio Sci Pre Meds graduate with a minor in Chemistry. How many shadowing hours have you done. Med Schools don't care that much about extra curricular activities unless it helps someone, like habitat for humanity or caddy stripping. So take Chem classes like now. You also need physics to. What you do is apply, and try for an interview. They look at your resume, if your decent they'll give you the interview. Basically, you need at least a 3.5 to get an interview. Maybe one more year of school wouldn't be bad.|`|f977e51d2f4a930956e1926a9b567712aa	Making a career choice can be one of the most difficult life decisons.  And when that career choice is medical school, there is a long road ahead in order to accomplish your goal.  It sounds like you have a fair amount of education under your belt.  Getting into the entering class of 2010 is not impossible for you, although it may be very unlikely if you are applying to allopathic (MD) schools.  Have you researched osteopathic (DO) schools?  These schools offer similar training as allopathic schools, with additional training in OMM.  The training works in quite a similar way as well.  4 years of medical school, and then a typical residency to specialize in your field of choice, whatever that may be.  Osteopathic schools' stats (GPA and MCAT) tend to be somewhat lower than those of allopathic schools (not always but usually).  This is somewhat due to the lack of knowledge of osteopathic medicine as a field.  It seems as if you have changed your career interest  a few times while in school.  That's common.  I highly recommend you shadow a physician for as many hours as you can.  Not only is some physician shadowing required for admittance to most medical schools, it will give you a good idea of the rewards and challenges associated with medicine.  Also, it will help you decide if this is what you want to do for the rest of your life.  Trust me, you do not want to be in medical school and suddenly decide that medicine is not right for you.  It is difficult for students in this situation to just walk away, especially if the student has taken on an enormous amount of debt, which most medical students are faced with.  With all that being said, now for your GPA and what you can do to improve your chances.  I do not know your science GPA, but will tell you that schools do take that into consideration.  Most medical school courses are science based, so they want an applicant strong in the sciences.  If your science GPA is higher than your cumulative, it will certainly help you.  A 3.0 does not make you a strong applicant for medical school, even for osteopathic medicine.  However, I have heard of people getting in with a 3.0.  I recommend you take a couple more science courses (maybe over the summer) and do your best to get high A's in them.  If you haven't taken them already, anatomy, physiology, histology, and immunology are excellent courses to take to prepare you for medical school.  Anatomy and physiology are both very demanding courses at most medical schools, and if you could do very well in these courses at the undergrad level, it would say a lot about you as an applicant.  As far as the MCAT, do as well as you can possibly do.  Show them you have what it takes.  Somewhere in the 30's would be great for you.  However if you are in the upper 20's, it is not the end of the world.  Also, applying to in-state schools will most likely help you.  Your chances of getting accepted to a school in your state is usually higher.  I highly recommend that you take a look at studentdoctor.net.  I have found it to be an excellent source of information.  I especially find the forums helpful.  I hope this helps a bit.  I know the road to medical school can be very long and tedious.  Good luck!
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Before you pay too much attention to any answer about pharmacy on Yahoo, you need to go to the website of the AACP (easy to google) and check out what they say about careers in pharmacy. THe AACP is the official national organization that coordinates information about all accredited schools of pharmacy in the USA. They have links to every school so you can check out the exact details of what the schools wants and how their program is arranged. <br>  <br>  Some colleges of pharmacy require you to have a BS or BA before entering, but others require only that you have completed 2 years of college with the proper prerequisites. Although many may require a semester of college calculus, I don't think that every school requires it. So, you should study calculus but not be obsessed about - it isn't that hard anyway. Pharmacy does require math skills - if you were bad in algebra 1 then you would probably have a lot of problems in pharmacy, but the real subject that you have to know is chemistry - you definitely have to be very good in chemistry to be a pharmacist. <br>  <br>  Check that website for authoritative information, OK?<br>  |`|iLrp65oXaa	Well since you are in high school you will still have to get an undergraduate degree to apply to pharmacy school.  Therefore you can take calculus in college. <br>  <br>   If you want my opinion take calculus in high school if you are not strong in math.  In high school courses you are able to get more help and personal attention.  In college your professor will not care if you are doing well at all.  This way you can take the AP test for Calculus or test out of Calculus 1.  Even if you then have to take calc in college you will have background in it and it will be easier for you.<br>  <br>  I highly doubt you will fail trig if you take algebra 2 in the summer.  This reasoning doesn' t make sense at all.<br>  <br>  To apply to pharmacy school you will need college calculus, so if you can not take calculus until you are in college (but do well in it) I don't see how that would hurt your chances.|`|AA11450863	Calc is recommended for you. Take as many math classes as you can.

I hope at least one of them isn't already taken.<br>  <br>  Elizabeth Cady Stanton (November 12, 1815 – October 26, 1902) was an American social activist and leading figure of the early woman's movement. Her Declaration of Sentiments, presented at the first women's rights convention held in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York, is often credited with initiating the first organized woman's rights and woman's suffrage movements in the United States.<br>  <br>  Sojourner Truth (1797–November 26, 1883) was the self-given name, from 1843, of Isabella Baumfree, an American abolitionist and women's rights activist. Truth was born into slavery in Swartekill, New York. Her best-known speech, Ain't I a Woman?, was delivered in 1851 at the Ohio Women's Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio.<br>  <br>  Frederick Douglass (born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, February 14, 1818  – February 20, 1895) was an American abolitionist, women's suffragist, editor, orator, author, statesman and reformer. Called "The Sage of Anacostia" and "The Lion of Anacostia", Douglass is one of the most prominent figures in African-American history and United States history. In 1872, Douglass became the very first African-American nominated as a Vice Presidential candidate in the U.S., running on the Equal Rights Party ticket with Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for President of the United States.<br>  <br>  Margaret Higgins Sanger (September 14, 1879 – September 6, 1966) was an American birth control activist, an advocate of negative eugenics, and the founder of the American Birth Control League (which eventually became Planned Parenthood). Initially met with fierce opposition to her ideas, Sanger gradually won some support, both in the public as well as in the courts, for a woman's choice to decide how and when, if ever, she will bear children. In her drive to open the way to universal access to birth control, Sanger was a controversial figure.<br>  <br>  Martin Luther (November 10, 1483 – February 18, 1546) was a German monk, theologian, university professor, Father of Protestantism, and church reformer whose ideas influenced the Protestant Reformation and changed the course of Western civilization.<br>  <br>  Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the sixteenth President of the United States. He successfully led the country through its greatest internal crisis, the American Civil War, only to be assassinated as the war was coming to an end.<br>  <br>  Robert Francis "Bobby" Kennedy (November 20, 1925 – June 6, 1968), also called RFK, was the United States Attorney General from 1961 to 1964 and a US Senator from New York from 1965 until his assassination in 1968. He was one of U.S. President John F. Kennedy's younger brothers, and also one of his most trusted advisers and worked closely with the president during the Cuban Missile Crisis. He also made a significant contribution to the African-American Civil Rights Movement.<br>  <br>  Abbot Howard "Abbie" Hoffman (November 30, 1936 – April 12, 1989) was a social and political activist in the United States who co-founded the Youth International Party ("Yippies"). Hoffman was arrested and tried for conspiracy and inciting to riot as a result of his role in protests that led to violent confrontations with police during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, along with Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Lee Weiner and Bobby Seale. The group was known collectively as the "Chicago Eight"; when Seale's prosecution was separated from the others, they became known as the Chicago Seven.<br>  <br>  Jane Fonda (born December 21, 1937) is an American Academy Award-winning actress, writer, political activist, former fashion model and fitness guru.  Fonda has served as an activist for many political causes, one of the most notable and controversial of which was her opposition to the Vietnam War. She has also protested the Iraq War and violence against women.<br>  <br>  Anne Hutchinson (July 20, 1591 – August 20, 1643) was the unauthorized Puritan minister of a dissident church discussion group and a pioneer settler in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New Netherlands. Her brilliant mind and kindness won admiration and a following. Hutchinson held Bible meetings for women that soon had great appeal to men as well. Eventually, she went beyond Bible study to proclaiming boldly facets of her own theological interpretations of the ministers sermons of that day, some of which offended colony leadership. Great controversy ensued, and after an arduous trial before a jury of officials from both government and clergy, she was eventually banished from her colony.|`|2259822f0cd7ff32d9ffac0f2a824a63aa	Rosa Parks.<br>  She took a stand by sitting down!|`|HkpMrMepaa	Rosa Parks<br>  Florence Nightingale<br>  Clara Barton |`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	John Adams<br>  Roger WIlliams (invented religious freedom and stood up for Indians against settlers)<br>  Mary Dyer (killed by Massachusetts Puritans for preaching when women were not allowed to speak in public) also Anne Hutchison)<br>  Abraham Lincoln<br>  Florence Nightingale<br>  Mary Wollstonecroft (early women's rights)<br>  Ignaz Semmelweis (physician who discovered important disease)<br>  John Muir (early conservationist)<br>  Toussaint L'overture (Haitian antislavery patriot)<br>  Galileo Galilei (scientists who opposed church)<br>  |`|ZLJN8VXOaa	I did George Harrison, but HA, he's taken.<br>  <br>  The essay's already over, Kristin!<br>  <br>  <br>  eek!

Be honest. <br>  You say you really want to go... why? Don't say because, or gee it seems so interesting, etc. <br>  The main question is "Why do you want to go and study there?" "What do you expect to learn?" "What will you do with it?"<br>  Be specific and be certain it's for a good reason, not just to visit, etc.<br>  Dress nice but conservatively. Don't hesitate in your answers.<br>  Read up on the history and culture, avoid wars and politics unless asked.<br>  Do not go on and on with an answer, again specific.<br>  Important, most good interviews end with, "Do you have any questions?"<br>  If you have not got the info already then ask about the courses, who,  what, when and where, etc. Living accommodations.

4dGAdhGbaa	If I were you, I would pick Valencia because you sound like you're leaning toward Valencia.  If you feel you won't be ready to go straight into 4-year, go there.  It's cheaper at community college, you get the same education you would at a 4-year, and you would still have friends from high school.  Plus when you apply for a job after you graduate, they are going to look at where you did upper-division courses, not lower division.  There are morons wherever you go to college, it just depends on the kind of people you hang out with.  I felt the same way when my high school counselor pushed everyone to go to four year.  If you feel you are not ready for UCF, don't go!|`|b3b9eafde2a033943ecae8909779b52baa	Go to community college first, then transfer to UCF.  Community college is cheaper and has small class sizes.  It's better to pay hundreds than thousands on classes, in case you have to retake them.  Plus, I think community college students have a higher success rate and priority when transferring.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	You should check the internet or the materials at the guidance office in your high school to see how UCF rates - I think they were tier Three - that is the next to lowest ranking you can have. If you are a 4.0 student then you should be going to a top tier school where you will get a rigorous education. I dont think you will get that at UCF and I definitely dont think you will get it at any community college. Some people who have limited options because of their financial or family situations must go to CCs - and they can do well, but NO ONE imagines that any CC is the equal of a good four year college. <br>  <br>  Why are you majoring in biology? Do you hope to get a job in biology? - then you have to compete against all the thousands of other students who are majoring in bio at all the other universities. That is Miami, USF, UF, UGA, Duke, Wake Forest, Emory, NC State, UNC, UVA, etc etc.  Getting a degree from a CC and then UCF is not going to make you competitive... you might succeed, but it will be tough. <br>  <br>  If there is a strong reason why you cannot attend a better school, then you can attend the CC and try hard to do your best. But if you can afford to get into a better school and can be admitted, it would be VERY foolish to go to CC.  <br>  <br>  I hope that you will reconsider your options and listen to your guidance counselor. She sounds like she knows what she's doing. 
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Northwestern is one of the top 20 schools in the US. A 3.8 and ACT of 28 I don't think is good enough to get you in unless you have some outstanding extracurricular achievement to catch their eyes. You should have no problem getting into UIC.<br>  <br>  Might want to look around at schools that are just a short notch lower down the list from Northwestern. You really are a bit overqualified for UIC, I'd say.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The schools DO take GPA, SATs etc into account. Just try applying without having outstanding grades and you will find out in a hurry how important they think grades are. <br>  <br>  When you are Harvard, or the other Ivies, or UChciago, or Duke or Stanford or the other elite schools, you get many thousands of apps from kids with great grades, and kids who have joined lots of clubs. But what you want at your school are kids who are leaders, who have taken charge, been competitive and done well. Not just been on the debate team, but won the state debate league individual speaker award. Not just been in Science Olympiad, but led their team to the Nationals and won a medal. Not just been in DECA, but started their own business and earned their own tuition money. <br>  <br>  There are at least 2 million kids entering college this fall. The top 25 schools will take less than 50,000 of them. You have to have credentials that say that you are one of the 50,000 best kids out of 2 million to be in one of these schools. <br>  <br>  If you belong there, you will figure out a way to prove it.|`|sdDxsN1Eaa	lol, i answered your other one first. but...<br>  <br>  1. show that you take an interest in your community. volunteer.<br>  2. show that you take an interest in your school. join a team whether it be yearbook or football.<br>  3. show you're responsible. get a part time job or help out a the hospital or local senior center or library or whatever.<br>  4. be yourself in the interview. imperfections & all. <br>  5. have fun with it!!!!!!!!!! do what you enjoy doing & relate that to the college admissions!<br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|e304c56bff79ec6d59f96a991c27676aaa	Start doing some volunteer work somewhere (preferably something you are interested in pursueing as a possible career/major). Volunteer work shows you are taking an interest in the community outside of just school stuff (including extracurriculars). It will also give you some good sources for letters of recommendation when you need them.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	As always, Ranto's answer is very good, but I disagree with him a little about the final answer. I don't think you should be worrying too much about the ranking of the schools. You are not getting a degree there, you are just visiting. All of these schools are very respectable and the courses you take will be pretty similar between the four. <br>  <br>  I think Illinois is too isolated, and it is in the Midwest. Certainly Illinois is All-American, but it is a long way from most of the things you might want to see. Either UMass or UConn are within an easy back-and-forth -in-a-day trip of New York or Boston, and within a comfortable weekend trip of Philadelphia, Baltimore and  Washington DC or Montreal or Quebec in Canada. Also, these schools are likely to have more kids from around the East coast, while Miami I think would have a preponderance of southern kids and Illinois mostly midwesterners. Miami is not within a weekend trip of anything but itself. If you are in the Northeast over the winter you can take a vacation trip to Florida to see Disneyworld or whatever... <br>  <br>  I think it is kind of a tossup between UMass and UConn but I guess I might give UConn a slight edge... it depends what subjects you want to study... <br>  <br>  I don;t think you could go far wrong with any of these choices. |`|adL8Qm7yaa	uni of mass is the best in there... boston has lots to see and u can travel to new york easily from there.|`|thrVgwEsaa	UConn, UMass, and U Illinois sound pretty good, Miami's okay too... I have a couple of friends from HS who are studying journalism now, so I was there when they did their search, and I remember them looking at these universities also:<br>  <br>  University of Missouri-Columbia<br>  U of North Carolina Chapel Hill <br>  Indiana University-Bloomington<br>  University of Florida<br>  UC Berkeley<br>  <br>  If you want to be close to New York, why not NYU? The Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute in NYU's college of arts and sciences is excellent with the plus of being smack dab in the city. This is actually the only university I have experience in since I considered it in my college search. Good luck!|`|AA11604732	Academically, there is a clear winner.  The University of Illinois is one of the best public universities in the US.  US News ranks it as the #40 university overall.  <br>  <br>  The University of Miami comes in second at #54.  University of Connecticut comes in third at #66 and the University of Massachusetts comes in last at #102.<br>  <br>  Miami is the only university near a big city.  It is also the only one that has a major international airport.  At UMass or UConn you would probably have to go to Boston to fly elsewhere.  Miami has a heavy Latin influence, and most people would not call it All-American.<br>  <br>  UMass is about two hours west of Boston and about three hours away from New York.  It is a beautiful area with lots of universities near it -- but not much else.  You will certainly see snow.  UMass is near the Berkshires (mountains).<br>  <br>  UConn is a little closer to Boston and a little closer to New York, but still not near anything else.<br>  <br>  While Illinois is the clear winner in terms of quality of education, it is also the most remote.  I hear that the Champagne-Urbana area is a great college town.  Friends who went to Illinois loved it.  But the area is in the middle of the Great Plains -- so the terrain is very flat.  There is nothing near these two towns except farm land.  It is 2.5 hours away from Chicago, and three hours from St Louis.  There isn't a lot that is close to it, but it is All American.<br>  <br>  Below is a link to university rankings in the US.  If I were you, I'd reopen your list of schools.  If there is a high ranking school that is closer to Boston, near Philadelphia or in Maryland, DC or Northern Virginia, I would consider those schools.  The only part of the US where train travel is common is the route that connects the major cities between Boston and Washington.<br>  <br>  If you insist on staying to these four schools, I'd choose Illinois.|`|o0VyLaPiaa	Uni of Miami is not a good first choice.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Duke is one of the great educational institutuions of the world, ranked among the best in the world in virtually every ranking system. <br>  <br>  They have a beautiful campus with a gigantic library right int he middle (which is what you need for being an English major or history major). Because of the high faculty to student ratio, you will have lots of small classes and your assignments will be mostly writing long papers, rather than multiple choice tests. You will learn to write really well. Lots of famous authors have attended Duke. <br>  <br>  In order to be accepted, you will need to be a top student, with high scores in your SATs and a high class ranking. You will need excellent recommendations from your HS teachers. <br>  <br>  Each of the elite schools has its own personality. Among the other top schools, Duke students are known for liking to party and for being really enthusiastic sports fans. <br>  <br>  You can have a great time there!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Of course all the state schools in New England have degree programs for education.  I was just recently on the campus of Keene State College in NH. That is a lovely area, especially if you like skiing or winter hiking sports. And RI College is also a nice campus that is a little more urban in Providence RI - PRovidence is a small city with seven universities, so there are a lot of interesting things happening there all the time. There are lots of other nice state schools in both urban and rural settings around New England. |`|cbada3cf40bdcfc436a4f834aafe6e89aa	UConn has a good program for what you're looking for.
6ogBfBmpaa	the part about them retelling it years later is a good idea, but i think you should find a better idea than the pizza guy randomly kidnapping them. it almost sounds like it's a joke. you need it to be more substantial to the story line.|`|PcP6eXdtaa	Actually, thats a great idea. more of a movie then a play, i dont like plays anyway... :P im sure if you could get actors and cameras and stuff that would make a sweet movie|`|8Wvrr9eVaa	it sounds more like a movie than a play.|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Sounds great for a movie.

XIEMvsUYaa	"Unfortunately" for us Harvard students, not all people are accepted. So a 4.14 average is actually recalculated according to Harvard's formula. I had a 3.99/4.0 from a good school, which is better than someone with say a 4.5/5.0 from a random school that Harvard has never heard of.<br>  <br>  Also, if you volunteer just for college, it will become immediately clear to colleges (they are trained to sniff this out), so please refrain from further questions asking about "chances" and do what you love, which will show up clearly and make your application stand out!|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Some 20,000+++ kids will apply to Harvard this year. Only 1200 will be on campus next September. Just about all the kids who apply have very high GPAs and SATs, so unless you have that you have virtually no chance to be accepted. The question is, what have you got to show that you stand out from the other 20,000 kids who are going to be turned down?<br>  <br>  If you haven't got some kind of awards, championships, achievements, etc that clearly show that you are not only a great top student, but ALSO one of the most creative, orginial, accomplished, kids in America (and the World!) then you are going to end up somewhere else. <br>  <br>  What have you got? <br>  |`|E5bDKyNyaa	Maybe you could learn to capitalize the first-person pronoun 'I' and use a question mark at the end of a question. I'm sure Harvard wouldn't take too kindly to you writing its name in lowercase, either. My GPA sure wasn't a 4.14, but at least I can write proper English sentences.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	One of my uncles had this problem - he was a genius and graduated from Stanford Med School when he was only 22. He immediately got a job as the Head Medical officer for an entire state. He used to have to go to court several times a month and testify in murder trials, etc. So he looked like he was about 17 and he was giving technical testimony that was condemning vicious criminals to be electrocuted. He told me that he tried to grow a moustache to look older but everyone just kept telling him that he had something on his lip and he should wash his face. hahahahah! <br>  <br>  Anyway, he grew out of it and became one of the best known MDs in California - for a while he was President Reagans physician. <br>  <br>  So, I don't think there's too much to do, but you have to believe that things will get better, and meanwhile, try to pay as little attention to everyone else as you can. Just do your thing and if you get good grades and mover forward in school, you will earn respect from everyone around you. <br>  <br>  Keep your sense of humor and set some goals for yourself.... a goal for attendance, a goal for GPA, a goal for not being upset. <br>  <br>  Good luck. |`|owjZhOOhaa	don't worry about what other people are doing. but the best thing for you to do is start to go to your lectures & seminars because you do not want to fail those classes just because you did not attend them.  once you start to go the first couple of times than you will realize that it is really no big deal.  you have already made the first step in going to college so just try to focus on what you need to accomplish and forget about the rest of the people.|`|9eb52a38fc2004eff140ecab7f276d4aaa	The only way you are going to get comfortable doing these sort of events is by doing them.  I am the same way extremely shy.  red faced.  Just go sit down and enjoy don't let these fears stand in the way of you furthering your education.  And you're only thinking how you think people are.....They may not really feel that way.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Veterinary schools are as hard or harder to get into than medical schools for human doctors. In order to have any chance at admission, you need top grades from a respected college, not online courses from some fly-by-night school. How do you think you can do chem lab, biology lab, physics lab or organic chem lab online? That obviously isn't going to work, is it?<br>  <br>  The best you can do is take some general education courses like English, psychology, a foreign language, or history. Then when you get out of the service you can use your GI benefits to pay for a top university education. Be sure to take your online courses from a respected brick-and-mortar school like Penn State or some other real school, not from one of these shabby $$$-sucking fake schools. <br>  <br>  |`|SIhxrxD3aa	You might be able to get some of your pre-vet courses out of the way online, but there are no online vet schools.  Think about it, how do you learn to spay a dog online?  <br>  Let the army know you want to be a vet.  There is an army veterinary core.  And if you want to go to vet school they will pay for it.
glVNfXMBaa	there is really no "perfect" degree for PREmed majors<br>  All you need to do is get the Required pre-req classes for medical school<br>  2 letters of rec from 2 science prof Additional can be from others<br>  take the mcat<br>  <br>  and get a degree of you choice. In the interview process some medical school admissions doctors ask something related to ones major sometimes they will give you a problem related to it.<br>  Example: Economics major maybe asked something about how to possible fix the economy. (There is NO RIGHT ANSWER TO THESE QUESTIONS THEY JUST WANTED TO KNOW YOUR WAY OF THINKING as in is it logical and possible). <br>  <br>  edit still there is a majority of science majors<br>  <br>  physiology and biology varying each year in amounts (some years there will be more bio majors other years there will be phsyio majors)<br>  but there are also those who have: psychology degrees, philo. degrees, engineering degrees, a class before mine was a studio art major and art history major.<br>  <br>  aside: two of my former profs when they went into medical school during their 60s werent science majors. One was a history major the other was a horticulture major. The one who was a history  major during his admission class majority were psychology majors. So really do not get discouraged if you are not a "traditional science major". <br>  <br>  Email me if you have any more questions.|`|I6YPgPNeaa	yes you can. there is no "essential" degree. at least as far as i know. i've heard of many doctors majoring in philosophy (my major) and getting in. so if you can get in with philosophy, i dont see why not sociology.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	As long as you complete the required prerequisite courses, you can do any major you want.<br>  <br>  For RELIABLE information about med schools, check the website of the AAMC - that is the official national organization that coordinated info about all accredited US schools. They have a lot of statistics on there, and one table shows what majors all the students were who were accepted to med school last year .<br>  <br>  Good luck.
by9KuBizaa	You don't need a Ph.D to become a cardiac surgeon.<br>  <br>  After your Bachelor's degree, apply to medical school.  After 4 years of medical school, you'll apply for residency in general surgery which is generally a 5-year program.  After the general surgery residency, you'll apply for CT fellowship (Cardio-thoracic surgery) which is another 2 years.  During your Bachelor's level college education you'll have time to work at any job you are eligible for.  By the time you are a medical student, you'll have little time to work.<br>  <br>  As a resident, you do get paid.  Most training programs frown on residents working because residency training is sooo intense.|`|ApFh12Sqaa	Good Luck, Hope you Do well|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	You will be at a disadvantage trying to get into med school with 2 years at CC, so it is important that you work really hard and be absolutely the best student there. If you can get great references and carry a 4.0 or close to it, then your CC background will not be too much of a disadvantage. It will all show up when you take your MCATs after Junior year. If your CC courses were not tough enough, or you didnt work hard enough in them, then you will never get a good MCAT score. <br>  You CAN do this, but you must be totally dedicated. A in chem, A in bio, A in physics with calculus, A in organic chem, A in biochem.  That will give you a fighting chance at getting into med school. <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  ps check the website of the AAMC the national organization of accredited med schools for a lot more info about med school.

13fK9Q2gaa	Both are good choices. I graduated from UCLA in '02 and I know about a dozen people that graduated from UNR. UCLA is very strong in every major outside of business, while UNR specializes more in the liberal arts. It really depends on what you are going for but if you have the opportunity to attend the 3rd best public school in the nation (UCLA), then I suggest taking it. UNR seems more like a commuter school where the majority of people live off campus and only socialize at football games. UCLA is a community in itself and will give you a true college experience. There are great looking women at both as well, but the edge of course goes to UCLA. Good luck with whatever you choose and thank you for serving our country. |`|Tc23KWgzaa	It's hard to say.

Why not take a semester at one of the local community colleges in NV? They are pretty good and you could get yourself back in shape for college and have a good chance to think about what major you might want to do. THE CC is really cheap and you would not have to use up your veterans benefits before you decide what you want to do. Then after you have spend a few months getting back in the swing of things, then you can apply for the real program you want to do, and the clock on your veteran's benefit will start then. <br>  <br>  No reason to limit your choices to only NV or LA. There are 4000 colleges in the US and nearly all of them would be happy to have a responsible mature bill-paying student! <br>  <br>  Good luck! |`|ErEsmxu9aa	I suggest that you explore Walden University.

pQWTxpfLaa	It depends upon what grade level in school.  Usually younger kids study things like Columbus coming to America, the arrival of Pilgrims, and the dates, places, and names that shaped important events.  We also studied Babylon, Egypt, (I still have a papier-mache' mummy I made for the project my class did years ago.  It is painted with heiroglyphics), England, Spain, Mexico, Germany and India.  However by study I mean it was an over-view, not as if each child became deeply knowledgeable about each country's history. We learned about George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, the Revolutionary War, Indian Treaties (they rarely include how treaties were routinely disregarded) and the succession of various presidents.  Older kids learn things about how America fit into the global picture.  Along with great inventions of the Industrial Revolution, they learn about the Westward Expansion of immigrants and some political aspects like the Louisiana Purchase.  Plus, usually they add things like how foreign events complicate the immigration problems here - such as the famine in Ireland or the government of Cuba sending all their condemned criminals to the U.S. in boats. It depends on the teacher whether or not they touch on subjects like the Vietnam War or the Holocaust in Europe, but we sure do know about the two World Wars and Iraq, the War With Spain, and even the War with Mexico when Texas was a country all its own. Recently, some textbooks have been rewritten with a political leaning, and most of us feel this is wrong. History should exist in a static form, not be bent to sway the reader to a point of view.  It is less common but school children still get some glimpses of ancient Greek and Roman culture and world history.  Then too, usually there is a great emphasis on State history and kids in California learn about California and almost nothing about Idaho or Connecticut.  Kids in Arizona learn Arizona history far more than Montana or Louisiana history.  By High School, usually ages 13 or 14  to 17 or 18, the study expands to much more worldwide issues.  To get deeply into another country's history and culture, however, that usually doesn't happen until college.|`|zknQnJgUaa	6th grade is Ancient History<br>  7th grade is World History<br>  8th grade is U.S. History<br>  <br>  In high school we study the same topics but in more depth.

bQ9JN7KIaa	Well, Einstein said that if you could go fast enough around a black hole, time travel is possible.Ever since Einstein revealed his special theory of relativity, time travel has become a possibility. Einstein didn't pull this theory, or even the notion that time travel is possible, out of thin air. Rather, he took the knowledge of the day, saw an inconsistency—a piece of a puzzle that didn't fit, so to speak—and thought about possible explanations. If you want to learn more about it, google theory of relativity, that should help solve your question about a theory.<br>  <br>  edit: whoever said time travel exists, your wrong. If time travel existed, it would be everywhere in the news, or the government would have kept it a secret. A simple guy on youtube explaining about time travel is a bunch of hoohaw lol.<br>  <br>  edit: @bill - you dont even know thing about theory of relativity if you say it is unrelated to time travel.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	This depends entirely on what your credentials are as an undergraduate. <br>  <br>  If you are one of the best undergrad students in the country in your field, then you can get a Grad Fellowship and grant that will cover all your costs - you will spend 5 years at UChicago, Duke, Stanford or Harvard doing nothing but reading and writing about the subject you chose. If you are a pretty decent student then you can get an Assistantship either helping with your prof's research or teaching lower level courses or lab sections in basic math, basic composition or some other topic where there are lots of students. That will usually pay tuition and most of the school costs and give you about $10 to $15 thousand a year to live on, which will probably not be enough. If you are an average student you will get no grant and you will have to pay your tuition and school fees. <br>  <br>  It really pays off to graduate from a famous school and have a top average - that makes grad school free, or at least affordable. For people who are not top students, it is a luxury that the colleges will grudgingly allow you to pay for.  In an ideal world people would be paid to study, but in the world we have there is only enough money to pay the best students. Good students have to contribute part, and average students have to pay all, of the costs of educating them to become professional scholars. Every college has to pick who they think will make the best use of the opportunity of studying as a graduate student. What have they got to go on except your undergraduate record? <br>  there was just a major commentary on the National news this evening that many schools are having to cut back on their clerical help and maintenance, and are raising tuition fees for all students because of the budget crisis and recession. The chances for more scholarships for grad students, especially in majors that are not critical, is pretty dim. If you are in nursing, criminal justice or engineering, etc. then the prospects are a little bit brighter.|`|AA10251347	Most graduate students HAVE to take out student loans to eat and survive while in school unless they are independently wealthy.<br>  <br>  At least know you will be in a pretty good position to pay them back after you graduate.
yV1jZkqGaa	Its basically like a bar chart, but you need to plot the data accumulatively.<br>  <br>  Frequency density is the frequency divided by the class width.<br>  <br>  e.g. how much tv do you watch? sorry about the bad example:<br>  <br>  Class:............Freq.............. Class width .....Freq. Density<br>  <br>  0- 1 hours ........12......................1 .................12 / 1 = 12       <br>  1 - 4 hours ........6  ..................... 4  ................6 / 4 = 1.5<br>  <br>  So in a histogram, along the x axis there would be a normal scale, at regular intervals, 0 - 4. On the Y axis there would be frequency density, in this case the scale would go up to 12. <br>  <br>  When plotting data you need to be inclusive of the class width. So the 0-1 Class would be a bar that is one unit in width. Whereas, the 1 - 4 class width would actually stretch from 1 to 4 along the X axis. <br>  <br>  ..I'm really bad at explaining.<br>  <br>  Try looking at these websites.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram</a>|`|O4oCqaKkaa	When we are given information about a topic it should be treated as data.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	A gpa of 2.29 is maybe not the 'worst' but it is pretty bad. So, I don't think it is surprising that a lot of schools turned you down. It would be even more understandable if you got any grades less than B in math or English composition. If you can only get a C in those courses in Community College, then your chances of graduating from a four year are not too good. They don't want to take in a student who they think would not be able to graduate. <br>  <br>  I think what you need to do is talk this over with the academic counselor at the CC. They should be able to help you work out a plan to continue your education. Part of the plan might be to retake some of the courses you did poorly on, and try to bring up that GPA. If you could get it up to 3.0 then I think you would have a fighting chance of getting into a four year school. |`|x62wDqmRaa	Don't worry, if you are white your parents will be taxed to send undeserving minority kids to college and your folks will not be able to afford to send you.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The first things the Ivy league school will look at is your GPA and rank in class. Then they will check your SAT. If all three of those are at the top of your high school, then they will look to see what outstanding accomplishments you have achieved. Have you won any State Championships?

Psychology is tough, because it's impossible to really get into someone else's head.  You can do your best, but it's not as easy to see if you're making progress.  Treatment is complicated, and requires constant re-evaluation.  You're also spending all day with unhappy people.

Of course there's melanoma, but as cancers go, it's very treatable and if caught early, it's survivable.  Also, with dermatology, it's easier to see when your treatment is successful.  It's easier to know when the patient is feeling better.<br>  <br>  If the choice was mine, I'd think about how deeply rewarding psychology could be, but I'd choose dermatology because success and failure is easy to see.

When you learn to program you have to be able to understand and create math equations for the programs - that would be the equivalent of algebra. I don't think you need to be able to do calculus, but algebra, yes.<br>  <br>  Also, you need to be a good speller. In IT there are lots of places where a single letter or digit error can really mess things up. If you are the kind of person who can read a sentence five times without noticing and correcting a spelling error, then IT is probably not the right choice.<br>  <br>  A third problem, and the reason why I got out of IT, is that your knowledge is constantly going obsolete.

For reliable information about accredited med schools, check the website of the AAMC - the official association of American med colleges. They have lots of information about medical education and links to every accredited school.  <br>  <br>  Besides a degree, you need to pass the national and state licensing exams. <br>  <br>  To get into med school you need a BS or BA from a good college with excellent (as in A's) grades in the premed requisite courses such as chem, organic chem, biochem, physics, calculus, etc. Also, you need a high score on the very difficult MCAT exam.<br>  <br>  It's not an easy path to follow, but if you are on fire to be a doctor, you can do it! <br>

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Pharmacy is a great career, but it is not an easy course of study, and it is very competitive to get in to Colleges of Pharmacy. <br>  <br>  You need to do some serious research to understand how the process works.  The national organization for pharmacy is the AACP - you can google their website which has a lot of information about all the different schools. <br>  <br>  Pharmacy is mostly chemistry, so if you don't like chemistry and you didn't get good grades in your HS chem, then there is not much point in thinking about this career. You will have to take Organic Chem before you go to Pharm school, and that is definitely a tough course. Also, you need to be pretty solid in math up to Algebra II level. <br>  <br>  Check it out and see if it makes sense...

There are VERY few scholarships for international students and many thousands of international students who apply for them.  <br>  <br>  Use the US News rankings or College Board to get lists of US colleges. Every college has a website that explains its admission procedure.  As long as you have the money, there will not be much of a problem coming to the USA for school.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Nutritionists have to take chemistry in most schools. And to be a registered dietician, I think you have to take two or three courses in chemistry. If you are bad at math you are going to have a very tough time in chemistry. Usually it takes algebra skills to pass chemistry. <br>  <br>  In college you do not get any credit for 'doing your best' - it is more like real life, you only get credit for actually succeeding in solving the problem. You wouldnt want to be treated by a doctor who couldn't do the work in med school but got passed because he did his best! That would be bad! <br>  <br>  Why don't you start practicing your math now and see if you can improve your math skills. Then you will be able to reach your goal - if you aren't taking a math course this year, why not change your schedule and take a math course.|`|lDaH0aYWaa	It's difficult at first but once you get into the routine it's easy.

There are plenty of American students who wish they had a 2.97 right now! Your English skills will get better and better, and you will feel more comfortable as time goes on. Don't be discouraged, keep working with the tutor, and try to get up to a 3.3 or 3.5 if possible. By the time you are finished you will have learned a lot and be ready to take on the world!!! :)|`|QLwzzqYfaa	That's a good GPA for a first semester, especially for an international student.<br>  I got a 3.1 my first semester, and I'm a traditional student.<br>  If you keep up with all of the course work and keep working with a tutor, I think you'll do just fine.|`|UKUR9AQTaa	Well my first semester I received a 3.3 and I was angry. So to me a 2.97 is not good, in fact I would have been in tears for weeks over that. But just keep trying to improve, don't worry about other students. All you can do is your best work.|`|AA11966821	A 2.97 is good enough to stay in school and graduate, but it is not good enough to get into grad school, and no employer will be impressed with a less-than-B average.  You could easily fall behind because your English skills are not adequate to the demands of collegiate coursework.  <br>  <br>  If you cannot pull up your grades substantially, you should consider a college or university in your own country, where you would not be handicapped by poor English skills and the difficulties of adjusting to a very different culture.  It would probably be a great deal cheaper, too.  You should be transfer your first year's credits to a university in your own country, too.|`|QmwYOQuDaa	If your mommy and daddy is paying for your tuition and you're not worried about scholarship, what do you care about GPA?  If you're currently on scholarship, than you will probably be shipped back to your home country soon.  Also depends on your field of study, I would've been kicked out of my program with that GPA.  You can make up for sub-par GPA to get into graduate school with either a good performance in your GRE or just get a Art degree from University of Phoenix, they take everyone who can pay for their tuition.

rswZJc5Yaa	Above all else, make sure you find balance... This is true in college and in real life as well. If you burn-out, what good would you be to yourself (and, your transcript for that matter)? <br>  <br>  Pharmacy is a demanding program (as many science-based programs are). I have a friend who completed her Pharmacy Degree two years ago. She worked hard, but she also partied, had relationships, worked, etc. <br>  <br>  And her grades - well, she got plenty of A's.<br>  <br>  I have a B Sc. degree, so I know how demanding the courses can be. However, you should have no problems working your way through them (successfully) if you manage your time and resources properly. <br>  <br>  I've included a resource for you below. Is is an e-book that I found online that talks about how to find balance in college... it's great! Check it out and read up on what it says about time management. It seems to have helped a lot of students in college (see the source below - it's called Easy-GPAbooster).<br>  <br>  Good luck with your program, you're walking into a very lucrative career!

You might have to study more than some classmates, but less than other classmates.<br>  <br>  As long as you're well disciplined and well-organized, you shouldn't have a problem.  Just know how long you can be out, how often you can be out, and keep in mind your priorities so you know when you have to stay home and study.<br>  <br>  Unless you'll be a commuter that lives over 30 minutes away, you'll have time to do other things.  Just make sure you keep up with your work.  It's easier to do a little work every day than to save it all for one day later on.  Besides, cramming for a test only loads your short-term memory; it doesn't allow your long-term memory to soak up the information.  I see some questions here on Yahoo answers, and I know that I used to know the answer to the question, but I can't quite remember because I didn't fully study it, I just learned enough of it for the exams.<br>  <br>  That's why we have alot of incompetent people out in the world now.

Some semesters you will have classes you find fairly easy, and won't have to put a ton of time into, that will give you more time for some fun stuff, other times, you will have a lot of classwork, and will have less time for fun. <br>  <br>  But, ALWAYS allow time during the week for some fun things, arrange your study time so you can get some done between classes, or set aside study days and times. Your program is math intensive and heavy in science, you will have a lot of classes with labs..this will be a lot of work..but f you stick to a certain amount of time for study, you will be able to have fun a few times a week.

You will have to take chem, biochem, organic chem and calculus. So, if you are a real good student, then good time management will get you through. But you have to be careful... if you get a borderline GPA as a freshman and then have to go into O-chem, you are going to be in tough shape. If you drop below the required College of Pharmacy GPA limit, they will kick your butt out. Usually that means a minimum of B in all your science classes. Be careful!
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Neurology is a specialty. You can not start studying a specialty until AFTER you get a general MD degree.

LOL  You need to know how to slow down enough to listen to your patients concerns, questions, and comments and how to best answer them.  You also need to show that you care- if delivering bad news- you need to be honest but break it to them and the family very gently and show you care by telling any good news, offering hope and even just a quick touch on the shoulder and telling them that they are not in this alone and you will do everything in your power to see them through it.  Be understanding of all situations that might prevent your patient from not having come in sooner- understand that elderly sometimes do not have the money, are scared, or have convinced themselves beforehand that they weren't as sick as they actually are.  Do not talk down to them, just accept it, and treat them with class and dignity.  Remember why it was that you wanted to go into medicine in the first place- to help people!

Also, for most schools, if you have taken even 1 term of classes at any school, then you are considered a 'transfer' student, not a new applicant. <br>  <br>  So, I think you are in trouble. You are going to have to turn over your CC grades. It is a big problem, but you did it to yourself. You need to go back to the CC, raise your GPA for at least one term (like, really raise, right up to a 4.0 for the term!)  to convince the 4 year guys that you are serious. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	American medical schools require four years of training. The first two years are mainly classes and the last two years are mainly individual and small group instruction with patients. You must take a difficult test to pass from the class stage to the patient stage - it checks to see that you have learned all the material very well. After the patient stage when you have received your Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree then you have another test before you can become an independent physician. After receiving your MD you start a series of post graduate training posts which vary according to which specialty you are following, For the most difficult specialties (for example, cardiac surgery) the training might continue for up to ten years. <br>  <br>  To gain entrance to a med school you must complete a series of tough undergraduate courses and probably receive a BS or BA degree. You must have an excellent grade average and an excellent score on a tough exam called the MCAT which most pre-med students take after their third year of college. <br>  <br>  For reliable information about med schools in the USA, check the website of the AAMC - the organization which coordinates US med schools.|`|AA11735935	In my understanding, you do an undergraduate 4-year baccalaureate degree, usually in the sciences, sometimes called pre-med.<br>  <br>  You talk the MCAT test.

However, it's not a rare case that community college students go straight to pharmacy school. The closest you can get into a 5 year pharmacy school from high school is getting into an accelerated program like University of the Pacific's pharmacy school. The program is 2 years of general studies and 3 years of pharmacy school.

So unless some WAY big turnaround in your study habits comes along pretty soon, you are definitely not being a doctor. <br>  <br>  The high school kids who will be in med school in five years from now are the ones who are taking AP chem, AP calc and AP physics and getting 5's on their AP exams.

Getting accepted there is a big challenge - and succeeding in their program is an even bigger challenge because they are famous for having the toughest courses and toughest grading of any college, bar none. The joke motto for the school is "where fun comes to die" because the students have to work so hard. <br>  <br>  When/If you are accepted to study there, you will probably be awarded a support stipend. It is not very much, but it is enough to pay your very basic expenses. <br>  <br>  Your GRE is going to be important, but even more important is the quality of the research you are currently doing. Chicago is VERY academically oriented - they want to see their students cranking out notable research. And, you will need VERY high recommendations from your major professor and other mentors. It would help a lot if your prof has some good friends at Chicago who can go to bat for you. <br>  <br>  Good luck, but have a plan B.
gxOvJGJ5aa	$36,342<br>  <br>  From: <a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drglance_3401_brief.php" rel="nofollow">http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreview...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck! |`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Actually, it is on their website.... <br>  <br>  Tuition for 2008-9 for a Brown undergraduate is $36,928 or, including room and board, expected cost of at least $47,740.<br>  <br>  Pretty mind-boggling, eh?<br>  
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	You have a lot of homework to do before you can start thinking about medical school. First you have to get your undergraduate degree, take all the tough premed required courses, and get a 4.0 in those, and then score high on the MCATs. When you are an undergrad at one of the top ten schools in the USA, then you can talk over with the premed advisor exactly what your plan will be for getting into these insanely competitive med schools. <br>  <br>   Last year Harvard College turned down over 2000 Valedictorians among the 20,000+ rejected applicants to Freshman admission. Being #1 is good but it is not enough. They can take their pick of high GPA kids - what they want is exceptional kids, kids who are creative leaders, who have actually had real accomplishments in the real world, not just grinds. Four million American kids are going to enter college next year, only 1200 will enter Harvard. What have you done to prove that you are one of the most promising kids in North America, not just #1 or 2 in a neighborhood in South Texas. <br>  <br>  You can't get into Harvard unless you apply. But you also can't get in unless you are head and shoulders above all your competition. <br>  <br>  Make a plan and go for it. |`|3G9RE3y1aa	Getting into any of the Ivy League and top-ranked colleges is a gamble. It does not matter if you have straight As and are the valedictorian. It does not matter if you have have a perfect score on the SAT. It's a gamble. There are thousands of other students with the exact same profile that are applying. Do your best, pursue activities you enjoy, and when it comes time to apply to colleges, make sure you include schools that AREN'T Ivy League. There is no "minimum" extracurrics that will magically get you accepted into college. Try to have 2 activities each semester and more in the summer, so you show that you are capable of handling the workload, but again: acceptance is just a crapshot. Nobody knows, except maybe the Legacy applicants, if they will get in. <br>  <br>  You could have absolutely perfect scores and could have had made important scientific discoveries over summer break, but some other kid could end up taking your spot. Why? Admissions doesn't just look at numbers. Yes, they look at activities and your personal essay, but they also look at demographics. Maybe they've already accepted four kids from your region and they just found an applicant to fill the southwest Alaskan spot. Maybe they found out that the orchestra needs another trombone player and they just found an applicant who plays. Another tricky thing they like to do deals with financial aid. All colleges like to have splashy lines in their view book about how many students get financial aid and how much each. If you need full tuition covered but four other people just need a couple thousand, there's a good chance that the college may consider choosing the four others so they keep up the ratio of money per student.<br>  <br>  The Med Ed program you refer to might be a nice resume filler and it will give you a chance to find out if a medical profession is something you want to pursue. <br>  <br>  In order to get into a medical school, you will have to earn your undergrad degree first. If you are a sophomore in high school, you do not need to worry too much about med school. Med schools will primarily at your college grades and experience. When preparing for college, you should take the hardest classes you can manage in high school and you should take many science and math classes if you plan to pursue medicine. Many colleges are also requiring two years of language study as well. When in college, you should probably major in one of the sciences or pre-med. You don't have to, though, but whatever you major in, make sure you take a lot of math and science courses.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of competition for med school, especially at the top-ranked colleges. In your undergrad classes, you will probably find that a lot of your classmates are incredibly competitive with one another.<br>  <br>  By the way, Princeton doesn't have a medical school.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	There are over 4,000 unis/colleges in the US and almost every one of them has a UK student enrolled. The biggest problem is usually the cost - uni is VERY expensive in the USA. An annual fee of well over $30,000 USD is not uncommon. <br>  <br>  There are several ways to check the reputation of a US college, but the easiest is to look at the college ranking system of the US News magazine (easy to google).  Not everyone agrees with the details of the rankings, but in general the US News list is a good general reference for what schools are most respected. And, all the schools on their lists are legitimate schools - no scams or ripoffs. <br>  <br>  Many international students finish their undergraduate degrees in their home countries and then come to the US for grad school. This is because of the cost - there are very, very few scholarships for foreign undergrads in the US, but at the grad level foreign students compete on a level playing field with US students. For instance, an English student with a degree in Literature from a good UK uni would probably be able to get a scholarship or teaching assistantship in the US and go to school almost free.... 
owjZhOOhaa	you should apply to as many scholarships as  you can. call the financial aid offices at the colleges you wish to attend to see if they have scholarships available that you can apply for.  also try fastweb.com and search for scholarships.<br>  <br>  the best way for you to get accepted into college is to first have good grades in highschool and have a good score on the ACT or SAT. you should apply to colleges the first semester of your senior year.|`|Zx8dDBY8aa	I find that getting into university is not that hard these days depending on where you decide to apply. I would try applying to a variety of colleges so you're not just restricted to the one near your area. I think you should concentrate on all the sciences if you are going for med school. For universities in my country, we take the MCAT for med school. I think it's important to prepare yourself for the MCAT or any other entrance exams they require. It's actually not hard to get scholarships either because so many people are giving them out and some aren't even being applied by anyone. You just have to dig hard for the scholarships. And last, make sure you have the grades. If you have high grades, universities will give you whatever you want.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	There is no way you will be accepted to medical school if you have only slightly better than average grades. So the first thing you need to do is to cut down on all your other activities and start hitting the books. If you can't make high honor roll in High School, then there is no way you will be able to make Dean's List in college taking the tough premed courses like organic chem, etc.  <br>  <br>  This isn't about how smart you are. This is about how hard you work. And about how good your study skills are. If you have trouble getting the highest marks, then maybe you can change the way you study in order to be more efficient about how you use your study time. <br>  <br>  Bump up your grades. Nothing else is more important than that. Having top grades is the key to scholarships, admission to top undergrad schools, and eventually med school. <br>  <br>  You can do this. but you have to REALLY want it. <br>  <br>  Do you have the guts to do what it takes?<br>  
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	You cans tart thinking about this if you remember that Jefferson was very smart, but he was rich, spoiled and self-indulgent - the son of a land owning family that was respected and established. He never had to work in his life.  Hamilton was brilliant, but he was the son of a poor family, had to make his own way without help from anyone, and very highly valued the idea of meritocracy - that people should be rewarded for their work. Hamilton hated slavery and tried to work out ways for business to prosper so that hard working people could become secure. His genius at managing money helped the US become a financially stable country. He was extremely honest, even when telling the truth caused him to lose money and reputation. He never liked France and thought that the US should be friends with Britain.  Jefferson disliked slavery but not enough to free his own slaves. He didnt like businessmen and believed that being a farmer was the best way of life (although he himself actually never did the work on his farm!) He never let his ideas interfere with his comfort. He liked France and made a lot of excuses when the French Revolution turned violent and ugly. Jefferson's friendship with the French led to the Louisiana Purchase, but Hamilton's good money management led to the US being able to afford to pay the cost of buying Louisiana. <br>  <br>  
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Doctors are not slaves. Why do you think that a Doctor should have to work for free anytime someone wants him to?<br>  <br>  It is very noble of everyone to insist that DOCTORS have to work for free, but why aren't people entitled to free automobile servicing, free laundry service, free entertainment, free food at a restaurant.... you don't want to work for free, but you blithely say that Doctors have to... nice of you! <br>  <br>  What if a patient comes into the office and the Doctor decides they need a blood test. Who do you think is going to pay for it? It might cost $200 - is the Doctor supposed to pull out the cash and pay for it? Are the women who work in the medical laboratory supposed to do the tests for free? If he doesn't do the test and tries to treat someone and the patient gets sicker, then the patient would be suing him for malpractice!  If the Doctor wants to give him a shot of antibiotic, who is paying for the antibiotic? Is the Doctor supposed to whip out $70 for the medicine? Is the pharmacist supposed to pay for it?  Probably they do this sometimes, but they can't do it every day every time someone walks in who doesnt have insurance. <br>  <br>  It is really the communities responsibility to take care of this problem, not the Doctors. But unfortunately, unlike every other wealthy country in the world, the US has decided that we can't be bothered to provide health care for poor people.<br>  <br>  ps it is NOT and has never been in the medical oath (Hippocratic or other versions) that Doctors have any obligation to treat patients for free, or to treat anyone who demands treatment.|`|258c8918b8008933d8507500eed704dcaa	you CAN NOT turn away any person because they don't have the money.  Part of the ethic vow doctors took....|`|dv8267AAaa	Some places doctors may be able to reject those without health insureance. Although some areas if the doctor care for a person who do not have health insurance, they will make note of that person and bring it fourth to the state. Then the person will be charged by the state ( ofcourse they knew they would be charged somehow without having health insurance, and may pay a fine/ put in jail if they don't pay the state or hospital...however it works) and if the doctor was suppose to get something out of the treatment they will give the doctor their part and the rest of the money goes to many things.... I think it works something like that. <br>  So if you dont have insurance, and don't want to pay for the treatment yourself.... then you may not want to go to the doctors. |`|PmZ8xxNqaa	If I were a doctor I wouldn't reject anyone because like you said, they are human and if you don't get them treated right away it can lead to major illness or even death. <br>  <br>  Doctor's should never reject anyone just because money is an issue. Doctor's should have the pride that they saved a life and not only look at the issue of money ONLY! They're doctors and what they do is save lives.. it's there job. They shouldn't reject a person if they don't have health insurance, that's not right!|`|ISAA101kaa	By Law in the state where I live at NO ONE is turned away!! regardless if the person Does or Does Not have insurance.  They should not be treated any different as well.  They should all have the same Doctor Attention and Medical Care as if they had insurance.  
ejodXS5naa	Yes, you have a good chance at any school you want to go to, if you keep your grades up.  I would even say your SAT's are fine already.  They are a bit low, but, seriously, standardized tests are not a good judge of anything other than standardized-test-taking ability.  And the top schools know this.  But as the previous poster said, you do not have the 'zinger' that you need to get into a top school.  He suggested winning some math competition.  That's fine.  It will help.  I would suggest getting involved in research at a local university.  If you can find a professor who will take you on in a lab or something like that, that will help you more than any thing else, at least at MIT and Caltech (and other top science schools).  Getting into Harvard and the like (ivies, Stanford, etc) is a bit harder to predict.  You have to have what they are looking for.  If you are a great Cellist and they already have one (or five) then it wont help you.  But if they don't, and they want one, it will help a lot.  It really depends on what they happen to want at the time.<br>  But, I would say that you have an good shot at any school, if you can keep you scores up.  And you have an excellent shot if you can do something to set you apart from the rest of the applicants.  By the way, college classes are very good, especially if they are at a legitimate school (something more rigorous than a community college).  You might also want to check out summer programs in math and science (like the Ross camp at Ohio State, I think).<br>  <br>  To the other answerer, your GPA really does not matter.  If your schools grades on weighted AP system, a 5 points system, or what not, that information is useless.  What the schools do is look at your class rank and your letter grades.  Not your GPA.<br>  <br>  Oh and Lehigh University is not like Harvard or MIT.  I don't know what that guy was thinking.<br>  <br>  By the way, I would guess by what you say that CMU is an almost guaranteed admit.<br>  |`|AA10338846	Forget Harvard, MIT-----Overrated<br>  Try Lehigh, Carnegie Mellon, Penn State, Lafayette, Ohio State---all are much more bang for your buck.<br>  <br>  To the a-clown below...."Darwin's Black Book" is a very good read if YOU can keep up.|`|6fyA5UiDaa	Well, I am in the same position as you.

I got a lot of extra-curriculars (math/science clubs, class president, varsity sports, etc...)<br>  <br>  I would like to go to M.I.T. because I am very interested in math/science. I am currently in AP Physics, and I love it. That's why next year and Senior year I will got to a nearby university to take Physics. <br>  <br>  Ok, well at my school AP classes aren't weighted. I think that at some schools if you get a B in an AP class it's like an A in a regular class... Well, yeah, at my school if you get a B in an AP class, you get a B.<br>  <br>  Anyways, my school doesn't have weighted G.P.A.'s either... Like our scale only goes to 4.0. Currently I have maintained perfect grades (straight A's = 4.0 G.P.A.)<br>  <br>  I'd say that you have an ok chance of getting into your choice schools. Grades are very important, and colleges will know that you did poorly Freshman year.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

I think it's good because my score is less, but even then it's still a good, especially for a freshman. The most you can get is 2200. 1870/2200=85% so maybe your percentile is 85%.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Just google PSAT scores and you will get the official website that explains exactly how this works. <br>  <br>  The scores range from 60 to 240.

The equipment depicted is of the second half of the war (steel helmets first used in 1916) but might be meant to portray the aftermath of the earlier chlorine gas attacks in 1915.<br>   <br>  The gas involved probably would have been chlorine, rather than phosgene or mustard gas (phosgene takes longer to cause harm, and in any case was usually used in mixture with chlorine, and mustard gas is a skin-irritant). <br>  <br>  WWI marked the first large scale use of poisoned gas, and the painting is perhaps particularly symbolic of the psychological impact of early chemical warfare - as the war went on gas caused relatively few casualties as methods were found of dealing with gas - effective gas masks and training, but it still remained a terrifying form of attack.<br>  <br>  Wilfred Owen, a poet of the great war, wrote a rather famous poem, the main subject of which was a comrade who failed to don his mask fast enough during a gas attack (Dulce et decorum est)<br>  <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dulce_et_Decorum_Est" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dulce_et_D...</a><br>  <br>  Both sides used poison gas, (both in contravention of a 19th century treaty outlawing the use of poison gas).<br>  wiki for more info on gas warfare:|`|X9oeSbrMaa	The picture depicts a scene of soldiers who have lost their sight due to a Chlorine gas attack. They have their hands on each others shoulders to be led the way by the one in front.<br>  Mustard Gas did not cause blindness. It induced the victim to cough uncontrollably and to cough up phlegm that was the colour and consistency of mustard. Mustard gas was actually Phosgene gas.|`|n18Q7t11aa	Blind men! Suvivours of a chemical attack no doubt. Is it homework?|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	If you google images for 'gas attack' 'workd war 1' etc you will find a lot of info on this painting. It is a close imitation of a number of photos that were taken of men who had been blinded by gas attacks. The painting has a lot more impact -- it is a huge painting.... larger than life size, I think, so it had a big impact when people saw it in England during the war. <br>  <br>  One thing about WW I was how physically close it was to the people back home. An officer could go home for the weekend, then have breakfast at his private club in London, get on the train and be killed in the trenches in France in the evening.  Paintings like this helped people at home understand the experience of the soldiers. A terrific book about the war is "The Great War and Modern Memory" if you want more info to help with your paper. <br>  <br>  Good luck |`|mgG721zqaa	First world war they used mustard gas and this famous painting shows how one sighted man is leading the blind men to safety.|`|zQHM8RSuaa	it shows soldiers blinded by mustard gas being led to the dressing station for treatment.|`|HF4c1y6laa	world war one
plptGgThaa	Other people gave good answers, but I would add one thing:<br>  <br>  Choose a school in place that you want to be. Going to a rural school in Kansas (no offense, Kansas!) may be difficult because you'll already be far from home and the social atmosphere of the school and its city/state will make a big difference in your college experience.<br>  <br>  I would advise applying to a mix of public and private schools in places that you think you will enjoy (I do like the Lewis & Clark suggestion, but more out of personal bias - I'm from Oregon and I think Portland is a great city and the school a good one!). Some earlier advice I would also recommend is to choose a school that offers you a good financial aid package! You may not get into a top "literature" school (which doesn't necessarily exist), but you'll be at an affordable school that you enjoy.<br>  <br>  I studied literature at Oregon State University (a state school in Corvallis, Oregon) and I really enjoyed it. The program isn't renowned nation-wide, but there are excellent professors (who are well-known in their respective fields - and they have doctorates from very respectable universities), interesting course options, and great advising.<br>  <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/cla/english/" rel="nofollow">http://oregonstate.edu/cla/english/</a><br>  <br>  I would say you have good chances of admittance (so long as you're choosing realistic options for your grades, educational background, etc) and just need to be open-minded and flexible so that you can find an affordable option. If you have a difficult time finding a school that meets your needs you may consider attending school in your native country and just doing a study abroad term/year at a school with a good literature program.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	There are 4,000 university level campuses in the USA. The large majority of them offer degrees in English, in Literature, Modern Literature, or some other version of literary studies. Also, nearly all large or well-known American universities have international students. The universities are familiar with the educational qualifications of foreign students and can evaluate you application with no problems. <br>  <br>  If you are a good student, there are hundreds of choices of schools where you could be admitted and 100,000's of students majoring in Liberal Arts. There is no point in trying to find a "best" school when there are hundreds of choices. And, especially, when you are looking for a scholarship. There are very few scholarships for international students in the US.... naturally, 99+% of the scholarships are reserved for US citizens/residents. University is VERY expensive in the USA, so, you would have to choose a school based on cost, not which one is "best" (whatever that means!) <br>  <br>  For more information you can consult the websites at collegeboard.com and princetonreview.com to see what schools are available to you. For a long list of respected schools, check the college rankings at US News magazine. That is easy to google. <br>  <br>  Good luck. <br>  <br>    |`|DFVP6Ldcaa	I would check out the top grad schools for English literature at US World Rankings. If it has a top grad school in your area, surely it will have a great undergrad program. I know some of the top programs include Yale, University of Virginia, Harvard, Cornell, Berkley, University of Chicago, etc. Also, you might look into smaller liberal arts colleges. I went to one of those and found it fantastic for an undergrad degree because the personal aspect of the program. Also, if you are interested in a specific area, you might find a school that isn't ranked with the ones I mention but is really strong in your area (like Tulsa for Modernist lit). I'm not sure what you mean by human studies. But I think that the dominant research mode for lit is the New Historicism or cultural studies.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The Ivy League schools are so competitive to get into, that nearly every student there is an EXCELLENT student. At Harvard, for instance, nearly every kid was either # 1 in his class or close to it in High school. And they are aggressive, hardworking kids. So in Ivy League schools (and equivalent), they dont give out a lot of C's. Not because they are sucking up to the kids, but because the kids are really, really good. <br>  <br>  In Community College there are some good students, but there are also a lot of kids who are not very smart, or not very well prepared in high school, or who have some other problem keeping them from doing well. The professors there are alert to the problems of the students and they try to encourage them by giving them good marks. I dont mean that the profs give A's for nothing, but they do tend to give the kids a break. So a lot of C's in Community College are for somewhat marginal work and represent what would be a failing grade if someone ever did that kind of work at an Ivy (which is wildly unlikely).<br>  <br>  I'd say an A in a community college would most likely be a B in an Ivy, but a C in community college would most likely be an F in an Ivy. |`|G3bzZzP2aa	C = Average<br>  <br>  You're an average, really smart person.<br>  <br>  An average, really smart person would most likely receive an A in community college.<br>  <br>  Good Day!|`|XgvelO3Laa	An Ivy League school has nothing to do with academic achievements. The title came from well  known footballs teams every college wanted to play against because they were the only games broadcasting on TV. They are schools, such as MIT(Mass. Institute of Technology), that are a much more critical level and close to impossible to get into, and are not Ivy League. So, though most Ivy League schools are really good, they are not a huge leap like that. A C is a C and an A+ is an A+.
5N3odm3Qaa	I agree with the others: Hofstra and Drexel will be a pretty big reach with a 2.9 but the fact that he plays football may help. Everywhere else on the list will most likely be pretty easy to be accepted. Drexel is tops for engineering but a close neighbor to Drexel is USP (University of the Sciences in Philadelphia). I believe the IT program there would be stronger than most of the other schools on his list.<br>  <br>  Use collegeboard.com for information about SAT scores, average GPAs, cost, and deadlines.|`|AA10023710	Without knowing his SAT scores, it's hard to say, but based on his GPA, I think he stands a shot at a lot of the schools on his list. Hofstra and Bridgewater State may be slight reaches, as are the UMasses, but not so  much of a reach that he shouldn't apply. Drexel is a reach, but he should have some reaches on his list. <br>  <br>  You list Hampton. Might he also be interested in Howard? I think that's a possible for him, and like Hampton, it's a very powerful name. <br>  <br>  You can look up each university at www.collegeboard.com to see what their average SATs are, and be able to judge if he has a realistic chance. Keep in mind that he should apply to some reach, some fit, and some backup schools. <br>  <br>  One of the colleges I might have him look at - and this is a bit off the beaten path - is Regis College, there in Mass. Regis, interestingly, was a women's college that only just went co-ed last year. What that means is that they are interested in bringing men to their campus. They may, therefore, be willing to throw some aid at your son, to get him to attend, if his SATs are in their range. Maybe worth looking at. They offer his major.|`|AA12021966	Get him to compare these factors:<br>  1. Size (# of undergrad students)<br>  2. Cost (how much can you afford - this actually might be clearer when you do the FAFSA in January of his senior year)<br>  3. How far away he wants to go for college (some people want to stay in their hometown, some want  to leave town but still be relatively close, others want to be on the other side of the country)?<br>  4. Religious Affiliation (is there a religion in particular that he prefers?)<br>  5. % of people from the college that go to grad school<br>  6. teacher-to-student ratio<br>  7. The quality of the Information Technology program (once he has chosen his top 4, go on a campus visit - scheduled with the admissions office - and evaluate the program). P.S. if you ask, they may be able to get you a host student and you'll be able to sit in on their classes.<br>  <br>  Most of these things can be found either on www.collegeboard.com or on the college's website. Then he will have to decide his top 8 or 10 (I don't recommend that he apply to all those colleges). It will be your son's decision though since it will be him going to school there, not you.|`|qT9kMFhfaa	The best thing you can do is to go to each of the colleges websites and look for the requirements and ACT/SAT, GPA scores---also remember the GPA that they give is an AVERAGE, if your son is not at that average STILL apply--I was below average at the school I applyed to and still go in!|`|7uznrLBXaa	Sorry, but your SON - not you, should be doing the research.  Trust me on that one.  <br>  <br>  Drexel is a great school in a great city.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	First, I think it is really important that you visit the top schools on his list (HIS list) - my kids had some schools they were interested in, and as soon as they walked around campus, they said, "no way!"<br>  <br>  Second, except for maybe Hofstra and Drexel, all of these schools should be pretty easy to get into. I don't think there should be a problem. But, I don't see any reason to go to any of the private schools and pay a big tuition - the ones listed here have no advantage over the local state schools and the $$$ difference could amount to $10,000s. If you were talking about Harvard or Duke, that would be different. And, If he gets a free ride because of his football, that's different, but in D3 that could be a problem. <br>  <br>  Third, some other schools you might check out would be the Connecticut State Unis, and why not UMass Amherst, U New Hampshire, Fordham in NYC, Keene State and Plymouth State in NH and Southern Maine in Portland. Any of those would be a bit more prestigious than many of the schools on your list and he has at least a good/reach chance of getting in...<br>  <br>  You are definitely going to need to do a road trip, tho. <br>  <br>  Good luck. He should do well if he finds a school that HE is comfortable with. What I learned when I went through this process is that we parents have to bite our tongues and just support these great kids we have raised.   <br>  <br>  |`|YzkB5nBTaa	i have only heard of about 2 of those colleges... i just know that hampton is primarily an african american college.|`|GTkKN0KFaa	Road trip!
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Pharmacy is chemistry. In fact, in many countries the word for Pharmacist is 'chemist.'<br>  <br>  So pharmacists have to know all about chemistry, and of course, they have to know all about physiology as well, so they can be alert for harmful effects in patients using their medications. <br>  <br>  For more information about pharmacy, google the AACP - that is the official national organization of pharmacists and colleges of pharmacy. <br>  <br>  Research pharmacists have to be completely comfortable with experimental design and statistics so that they can evaluate drugs and treatments. There are numerous other aspects of pharmacy that are hard-core science. That's why pharmacy school is four years long and the admissions standards are so high.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	In the USA all Colleges of Pharmacy now grant only Doctors of Pharmacy degrees (PharmD) - the BS is no longer offered in the USA as a first professional degree in pharmacy.<br>  <br>  These programs are four years in length... there are one or two programs that are slightly shorter (they cut out vacations)  but basically there is no way to cut the length of the program. To enter the Pharm D program you must be a very competitive candidate - our local state school is not famous or high ranked and a recent article said that they had 1200 applications for 90 seats this year.  The prerequisites are similar to premed - that is, chem, organic chem, biochem, bio, etc... these all must be taken with labs, so you cannot do most of them online. <br>  <br>  For RELIABLE information about pharmacy, google the website of the AACP - that is the official national organization for all accredited US Colleges of Pharmacy. They have links to every school so you can check out the exact details of the schools you might be interested in. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10770384	Well first off thats a big transition from international studies to pharmacy. Pharmacy can only be taken at campus , visually of drugs and such.

Online pharmacy classes or to graduate are not achievable. Sooner or later you must enter the labs.

Or that you are going to college to be a pre-med student?<br>  <br>  If you are just starting college you should forget about trying to learn medicine. You will never get into med school unless you focus 100% on your prerequisite courses of chem, biochem, organic chem, physics and etc.  The best prep you can do is to review your chemistry until you know it inside out. Then when you get to college you will have a fighting chance of getting A's in your premed courses. No A's means no admission to med school. <br>  <br>  One step at a time. If you do well in your undergrad courses and get admitted to med school, they will teach you what you need to know at the right time. <br>  <br>  If you are really dedicated to medicine and want to learn some extra things, every library has medical and health bools that you can borrow and read for free.

cMZEmpp0aa	Well, I think you're pretty lucky if you were able to work full-time and still handle school. You're also pretty lucky to only have $16,000 in loans, since the national average is close to $50,000 for a 4-year degree and considerably higher for anyone going on to graduate school. I knew plenty of students (peers of mine as well as people I tutored or taught) who either couldn't handle a full-time job and going to school or who couldn't find a full-time job while in school. Plus, given how ridiculously expensive college is today, there are plenty of people who wouldn't be able to pay their way through school even if they could find full-time work. There are also plenty of people who really don't care where the money is coming from, they're going to be motivated (or not) because it's just their nature. Then there's the whole idea that college is something everyone needs to do anyway. I think when all of those factors came into play, it really pushed a lot of parents in wanting to pay for part or all of their children's college education. I think generalizing from your own position is a bit of a stretch and might even be a little arrogant. |`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Actually, the question works the other way. Many years ago it was normal routine for parents to pay for college, then after WW II with the GI Bill and low college expenses, many students started to pay for their own college. I did. But now college expenses have gone up and it is harder for students to hold full time jobs while attending competitive schools. With the amount of work my kids had to do at their top-ten colleges, there is no way they could have held more than a 10 -15 hour per week job. Earning only $12 - 15,000 per year they couldn't possibly have paid their $40,000 annual college bills. I paid them. They were extremely hard working, got top grades, went on to med school and are now very hard working and successful MDs. If I asked them to repay me, they would do it in a minute, and easily could do it. Ask me how proud I am of them!<br>  <br>  Every parent wants their kids to succeed. In today's world college is a part of success for almost all kids. So, some assistance from parents is needed.
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The College of pharmacy is not going to care too much what you major is, they are going to look at the grades you got in the main prerequisite courses - especially chem, organic chem and biochem -  and at your PCAT score and then at your general overall GPA. <br>  <br>  For reliable info about Colleges of Pharmacy, google the website of the AACP - they are the official organization that coordinates info about all accredited US colleges of pharmacy. <br>  <br>  Good luck! <br>

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	IN general these two programs do no go together very well, and there are not many schools where you could do both. THe problem is that both science and art classes require many hours of labs. In art you have to spend a lot of time in the studio preparing your art projects, but in science you have to spend a lot of time in the labs doing your lab assignments. There just isn't enough time in the day to do all these different lab assignments and also study for the very tough science course tests. <br>  <br>  I think you will have to decide. If you do art, then it is going to be hard to do all your premed prerequisites. If you do premed, say as a chem or bio major, then you will be able to take a few art courses on the side, but you will be low priority when it comes to getting into the art classes and getting studio time or space. <br>  <br>  Too bad, but that's what I think. <br>  <br>  |`|roHCDr4laa	some good public ones would be: ucla,chapel hill, virginia, maryland at college park, and penn state<br>  <br>  private: wake forest, boston college, stanford, yale, harvard, dartmouth, princeton, brown, columbia, penn, and cornell<br>  <br>  depends on how much you are willing to pay
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	I am having a hard time trying to understand why you want to be a doctor if science and math are your weakest subjects? What else do doctors do? It is all about science. And you can't understand most of the diagnostic tests and the physics that are involved in medicine unless you are comfortable with math. If you were bad at math and science and somehow managed to become a doctor, you would be killing patients right and left! <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you have an unrealistic idea of what it is that doctors actually do. <br>  <br>  There are plenty of jobs where you can help people and work with people who are suffering, that do not require advanced science and math skills. Try to talk to a job counselor about what other lines of work you might be suited for. Your desire to help people is a good thing, but it will probably not work out for you to help people as a physician. <br>  <br>  |`|AA10889282	Are you really giving it your all? Some classes are easy to breeze through and others are not. Are you studying every day and as often as you can?

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	In many countries medicine is an undergraduate course. You can get a bachelor's degree in medicine in four or five years starting after high school. This is often referred to as an MBBS.<br>  <br>  However, this degree is not awarded or recognized in the USA. In the USA to be a physician you must have a doctoral degree from an accredited graduate school of medicine, either an MD (Doctor of Medicine) or a DO (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine). I think that the program you mention is not intended to be a completel medical training - it is more like an undergraduate major for people going on to medical school.  |`|gVITlOMUaa	wouldnt it be just a  bachelors in science?|`|GGSpgre7aa	I think you need to get those from a Medical School, but I also think you can get a Medicine Bachelor's Degree at a regular university, then go to Med school to get your license.|`|MyKdKt2Oaa	That's probably a pre-med bachelors degree before medical school. You can get a bachelors degree in psychology and/or chemistry (from, like, all 4-year universities). You may be able to get a Bachelors degree in chem with a specialization in toxicology. just google your specific desires in a program in universities. <br>  <br>  Ex. <br>  <br>  Google search: universities and toxicology specializations.|`|4zbzyaPHaa	You can get a pre-med degree, but you have to go to med school to get your medical degree.|`|48a29b5cbd035f266308a26290a846b7aa	Yes OF COURSE! =) |`|A56IXAiuaa	..........
zyrqQiIaaa	It is possible to apply for this program if you are already enrolled at Rutgers. I know people who did the 2+4 pharm program by doing the first 2 years at the Camden campus and then transferring and doing the other 4 years at New Brunswick. The only thing is, do not wait to apply after you've done those 2 years because then you would have waited too long and you'll have to wait until the following year to re-apply. If, for instance, you want to be at the New Brunswick campus next fall studying pharm, then you need to apply now rather than later. Of course, all of this is highly dependent upon your undergraduate coursework and GPA.|`|0ex9jvWVaa	Yes you can<br>  <br>  Just make sure your grades are good, high GPA (3.0 MINIMUM), in the first two years<br>  Then  you can apply to the "professional" (last four years) part of the program.<br>  <br>  Read this:<br>  <a href="http://pharmacy.rutgers.edu/PDFs/C-to-C_Newark.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://pharmacy.rutgers.edu/PDFs/C-to-C_...</a>|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	It might be possible, but make sure you have a 'plan B'. <br>  <br>  The problem is that the pharmacy program has only a limited number of seats. In the beginning they fill up all those seats with kids like your friend. Those kids take the prerequisite courses. If they do well then they enter the College of Pharmacy. But if they don't then they lose their seat. So when the college accepts applications at the end of the first two years, it is only for the seats that are open because of other kids failing out. Probably that means that there will be only a handful of vacancies. (At another school I am connected with, they had only two seats open because of failed out kids and 500 applicants who wanted to get in.)<br>  <br>  So, in the admissions information it might say that you need a 3.0, but that only means that you can't even apply unless you meet that minimum standard. But it is wildly unlikely that anyone who has only a 3.0 would be admitted. Probably you would need a 4.0 plus something extra going for you....<br>  <br>  Sorry, but I think that's the way it works right now with pharm schools.

You can go to any college anywhere and find good Christian friends to hang with, and a good Minister in a Baptist church within walking distance.

You will need a 3.5 minimum GPA and high scores on the PCAT or MCAT. After admission to professional school you will spend four years training in medicine or pharmacy, three years of formal classes that are quite difficult followed by a year of practicum. In pharmacy you may do an additional one or two years of fellowship training, In medicine you will do from one to six years of specialty training. <br>  After that you will be a fully qualified physician or pharmacist (assuming that you pass the difficult licensing examinations).<br>  <br>  In the USA the job prospects for both of these professions are very good - you will make a good salary and have no problem finding a position wherever you go. The USA will not recognize your training if you are trained in Africa, especially in pharmacy.<br>  <br>  Both of these programs are difficult and competitive.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	The story of the Native Americans in my area was recorded in some detail by early settlers, and there are many artifacts from their culture in local museums. They had no written language, were very poor farmers with only a few crops, did not do weaving, brewing, and only a very small amount of pottery making or basketry. They did not do metal working or mine or refine metals. Their tools were made of wood or stone. They were basically hunter-gatherers. They had only the simplest kind of 'government', had no engineering skills, lived in very simple huts made of sticks, had no medicine to speak of, did not raise domestic animals except for a few dogs, and their art was extremely simple. They had no musical instruments except drums and possibly some crude flutes. Their clothes were sewn from animal skins and had some, but not much, beadwork. <br>  <br>  When the English came in the 1600s, these people immediately adopted a large number of the English customs and technologies, and within two to three generations many were living in wooden houses built from sawmill lumber, had cattle, horses and sheep, were growing wheat and other European crops and wearing clothes of wool cloth woven on hand looms from their own sheep flocks. They learned to read and write and many were assimilated into the English culture... <br>  <br>  They were not stupid, but they had been cut off from the technological advances of the rest of the world. <br>  |`|knHa8qImaa	I guess this would depend of what group of Indians you are talking about. Some south american tribes, such as the Aztecs, were relatively advanced. They had an amazing grasp of mathematics. I mean this in the most non-offensive way possible, but most north american tribes were very "primitive." They were enveloped by superstition, their social structure was anything but advanced, and the same goes for their technology and way of life. History and archeology strongly support this. If you have a native american ancestry I wouldn't look at this as a insult to their culture. It's history, we can't bend the truth to make it more palatable.|`|AREMVu6saa	Have you ever read "The Stand"?  Imagine that happening and then some folks coming in and seeing you and your people 50 years later.  Might they find you a little primitive, trying to recover from a pandemic that had wiped out most of your people?<br>  <br>  That's the state that Europeans found many of the North American Indian tribes in.  So, by any standards, they were living quite primitively.  Their civilization had been wiped out 50 to a 100 years earlier by diseases brought over when Indians made contact with Europeans.  <br>  <br>  In the places where this had not happened, the Europeans met with cultures that had things they'd never seen and met up with advanced civilizations - the Aztec, the Inca, the Mayan, for example.  They were such ignorant men that anyone who did not worship their god, did not dress the way they did, did not behave exactly the way that they did was labelled "primitive" whether or not the label was deserved or not.<br>  <br>  I'll pare down and go a specific small example of European attitudes and how their cultural blinders made them incapable of seeing any culture but their own as anything of worth.  In North America from the time of the Pilgrims on, you read a lot about "squaws".  You read how savage the squaws were and how they lead horrible lives.  <br>  <br>  Then you consider the source.  The writers were men who didn't believe that women should own property, vote, have their own opinions, be well-educated or have the rights of a male.  Women should be submissive and sub-servient to men.<br>  <br>  So looking through their filter, any woman who could choose her own sexual partners, who was allowed to be as strong as a male, who could own property, rule a village, have rights equal to or more than a male was some how "unnatural" and "savage" because no "civilized" woman would want such a thing.  <br>  <br>  In my own tribe, in the old ways, women owned the property.  Men hunted and literally brought home the bacon.  It was an even steven arrangement.  If you wanted meat to last you through the winter you had to be nice to the men.  If the men wanted a place to sleep at night, they had to be nice to the women.  The Whites found this equitable arrangement wholly savage.  <br>  <br>  Again, in my old tribe, in the old ways, both men and women played stickball, both with equal fervor.  The Whites found the idea of women stripped down to the waist, waging war in a game to be totally and appallingly "savage".<br>  <br>  So no.  The Indians weren't savages.  In some cases they were living in a primitive state when the Whites found them, but this was a temporary condition caused, unintentionally BY the Whites who had brought disease with them and thus spread an almost unimaginable pandemic over the continents.|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	wow some of these posters are really off base. they call us savage without even knowing the facts!<br>  <br>  here is a fact, the US Constitution was based in part on the constitution of my nation's confederacy. We are Haudenasaunee (Iroquois). Our Great Law impressed people like Jefferson, Payne and Franklin so much that they invited our leaders to the first Constitutional Convention in NY. Of course when we arrived we did not understand why the colonists didn't bring their women for such an important undertaking. We brought both our men and women because for us, we all have a voice and are the oldest true democracy in the west.<br>  <br>  calling us savages when they are the ones who brought the practice of scalping to these shores is pretty ironic. check out the laws in what is now massachusets in the 1600s and you will see how much money  a scalp of an indian child or woman was worth.<br>  <br>  The Acts and Resolves of the Province of Massachusetts Bay  Vol. I  1692-1714   Pg. 292<br>  <br>  Fifty pounds reward for an Indian scalp.<br>  (Sec.1.)

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	I have known two kids who were accepted into these programs - one at BRown and one in Washington. They each had over 2300 on their SAT and way over 4.0 in their HS GPAs with outstanding recommendations and a whole long list of extracurricular accomplishments, including both of them had won medals at Natl Science Olympiad and one had won a Westinghouse prize. They also had both been doing volunteer work in medicine at various hospitals, nursing homes etc since they were young teenagers. <br>  <br>  I also know at least two kids who had almost equally good credentials but who were turned down. They lacked the volunteer work. <br>  <br>  I guess the bottom line is, the schools are not going to give a guaranteed admission to med school to someone unless they are totally convinced that person wants to do medicine and has the chops to do it.

Obviously Duke is the most competitive, but if you are applying for ROTC then I think that would be a positive - the ROTC guys would go to bat for you. Without ROTC I think you would have a tougher time at any of them. UNC is going to be quirky because they do have only a relatively small number of out of state kids.

I don't mean early decision, I simply mean getting your application in months before the deadline.<br>  A lot of students seem to think that it doesn't make a difference, but it really does. They don't wait until the deadline to start reviewing applications - they try to get an early start by reviewing applications that come in before the deadline so that they aren't as flooded with work later.<br>  I'm not saying you don't have a shot, but I am saying... get those applications out by the end of the week. It can only help you.<br>  Not only do the schools look at your application sooner than others - who might have better grades/scores than you and therefore would have been chosen over you had you applied later, but it also shows them that you really want to go there.

It is a very prestigious school which has been favored for generations by the sons of wealthy society families. THey have very high level academics there, and their students go on to some of the best graduate programs in the world. <br>  <br>  Northeastern is a large university in the heart of the city of Boston. It is a respectable school but the admissions standards are not nearly as competitive as Amherst. Northeastern has had a tradition of being a road to success for the children of blue collar families - NE has had cooperative education for decades - working while you are in college to earn part of your tuition and get job experience.<br>  <br>  You could major in chemistry at either of these schools but I have never heard that either of them was particularly famous for chemistry. <br>  <br>  If these were your choices, then I think you need to do some more research before you send in your college applications.

So, by that time all the spots will have been filled. <br>  <br>  You should talk to the health science advisor at your college to get the proper advice as to how to schedule your med school application.

You're expected to know all of the material, not just what you expect will be on a test.  If he's told you to focus on specifics, bear in mind you haven't had his final yet.  You also have this little thing called the MCAT coming up.  If you think your instructor's questions are unfair, you ought to take a few practice MCAT exams.  Then maybe you'll understand that it isn't what your instructor tests you on, it's the extent of knowledge you're expected to gain.  |`|Vlb1svvzaa	Visit the professor in his office and talk to him, ask him questions, build a personal relationship with him. |`|GKbEo7d6aa	First, take a deep breath and relax for a minute.   Sounds as if you are putting so much pressure on yourself that you are developing a mental block.   Then think your game plan thought which should include good study partners.<br>  <br>  There is more then GPA considered when it comes to Medical School.<br>  <br>  I have a son that dropped out of high school and got his GED, then decided to make something of himself.   He got a degree as an RN and a second in Biology.  After working as an RN for several years he<br>  he applied to Medical School at two in state universities.   <br>  <br>  When interviewing at the smaller of the two he told them he was going to find somewhere to go to Medical School and ended up on a waiting list.   At the larger he told them he had always wanted to go to Medical School there because it was the best Medical School in the region.   He was immediately accepted and has practiced in some of the best hospitals in the Midwest and eastern states.<br>  <br>  A family friend had a 4.0 from high school and a 4.0 from undergrad school, but was still known as a party person.

They know something you don't know. <br>  <br>  Why don't you ask them if they can help you out. <br>  <br>  This is the way premed works. The profs are going to expect you to go over and above what normal students do. If you respond, then you are going to make it. <br>  <br>  Here's a story - when one of my kids was premed, he had to take organic chem. He and three of his buddies made a pact. They agreed to spend their entire sophomore year in the library. And they did. Every single day from breakfast till bedtime they were in the library if they were not eating or in class. They only took off Sat afternoon and evenings.  They studied until they knew everything backwards and forwards and they all got curve busting A+s in organic.  Three of them are now resident/MDs and the fourth is a practicing PharmD. <br>  <br>  How bad do you want it?<br>  
wn1KKbXQaa	Definitely harder to get in.  Professional schools, once you're in, tend to do everything in their power to keep you in.<br>  Optometry is a separate occupation - you would have to go to optometry school.<br>  The MD degree is what you get when you've completed medical school.  Once you have completed med school, you have to choose the specific field in which to practice which require residency programs (e.g. general surgery, family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, etc.)  There is no "best" field - it depends on your interest and passion.  |`|VR0h4L32aa	i think it is harder to come out, surgeon earn the most, then MD, then optometry. good luck.|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	For reliable information about med schools, check the website of the AAMC - that is the official national organization that coordinates info about all accredited US colleges of medicine. <br>  <br>  It is quite hard to get into med school - you need to be a very good, very consistent student with excellent marks in a series of tough courses such as organic chem, physics with calculus, etc..  It is hard to get through med school, but most students make it through because they only accept the best to begin with. If they didnt think you could handle the toughest courses successfully, they wouldnt let you in! <br>  <br>  Physicians who are GPs working in a HMO might earn only $80 or $90 thousand a year, but surgeons who do a lot of procedures might make much, much more than that. They have to be trained for many years, they work hard and their work is stressful, so they get paid a lot.  The best field is the field that you like and you feel most comfortable with. <br>  <br>  When you get to college, you can immediately sign up with the pre health sciences advisor who will help you develop your plan for getting into med school. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	I have never heard anyone who was actually a student at Harvard say that it was easy. I have heard that comment many times from people who got waitlisted at Harvard and wound up at other schools. <br>  <br>  Cambridge is a world famous school, but the way in undergraduate education is carried out there is dramatically different from the American system which is used at Harvard. The most significant part of being educated at Harvard is the resources that are available to you as a student. If you want to talk to the highest expert in the world on any subject, the door is open, whether that person is a Harvard professor or a celebrity or expert in the outside world. Harvard's network of alumni and friends is unsurpassed. And they have by far the largest financial resources of any school, so student projects are supported financially in research sites around the world. <br>  <br>  If you are lucky enough to get into either of these wonderful schools, it would IMHO be foolish to turn them down. But probably very, very few students get to choose between them. <br>   |`|foHdTbnaaa	It depends on the subject you're interested in, but I doubt either would be interested in someone who doesn't know the proper capitalization rules for the English language...

(It can't hurt to ask questions about the homework even if you only have one or two problems left undone.) Even if your homework takes three hours, four hours, or five hours. Do it.<br>  <br>  (I say this as someone who studied from 6 or 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. during junior and senior year in high school. Now I'm at MIT. Worth it? Heck yeah! When you call someone in high school a "nerd," that translates to "doctor," "writer," "journalist," "leader," "scientist," "lawyer," "statesman," "manager," "teacher," "businessman," or "veterinarian" about ten years later.)<br>  <br>  Second, review material before tests. If you know there's a test in Algebra on Wednesday, then Monday night you should list the topics you learned and then do a few practice problems from each one - say, four problems. You should be able to get all of them right. If you miss one or two, pick another two problems and then go through those.  If there's anything that you don't understand, go to your teacher on Tuesday at lunch or after school and ask him/her to explain that section or recommend more good practice problems to go through.<br>  <br>  (This technique also works in college, just so you know.)<br>  <br>  Third, start essays and projects early if you can. Like, three days early - even an outline and a few fleshed-out paragraphs is an achievement. You don't want to do everything last minute, because that just plain sucks.<br>  <br>  Lastly, figure out *why* you're doing so poorly in the classes where you have an F. And figure out *why* you're doing well in the classes where you have an A. (Hint: the answer "the teacher sucks" isn't a good answer; it won't get you anywhere. Even if it's true.) If you're having trouble on tests but doing well on the homework, you know you need to study more. If you're forgetting to do homework, buy a planner and tie it to your backpack with a piece of string so that you can't lose the planner - then USE the planner to write down assignments, tests, reports and other things.<br>  <br>  By the way, you should IGNORE the examples the planners give. I remember that mine had "examples" like:<br>  <br>  Monday<br>  - Math problems pg. 238 # 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 22<br>  - Paragraph about my trip to Guadalajara, for Spanish III<br>  - Brainstorm topics for English paper<br>  <br>  Tuesday<br>  - See "Annie" play after school<br>  - Read Chemistry book sections 7.1 - 7.8<br>  - Do Chem problems pg. 303 # 1-5<br>  <br>  But my REAL planner was like:<br>  <br>  Monday -<br>  - Read "Flowers for Algernon" for English<br>  - Write a page review of "F f A" for tomorrow<br>  - Do all fifteen problems for Geometry<br>  - Start essay for history - research the Thirty Years' War<br>  - Volunteer two hours after school<br>  - Read bio chapter, do probs 1-10 and 12-14<br>  - Walk the dogs<br>  - Science Club meeting after school<br>  |`|nrlJNj2kaa	Of course you have to study. Study your homework (if you have any) each subject for a little while every night, maybe for about 15-20 minutes. If you dont have any homework, then study (for math: practice) what you have been learning in class so far. Do ALL of your homework and classwork correctly (If you take the time to do your homework/classwork, take the time to do it correctly instead of wasting your time and getting a bad grade). When your know that a test/quiz is coming, ask your teacher what is going to be on the test/quiz so that you will know what to study. Flashcards help a lot when I have to study. You can make flashcards the night before school, and when you know you have a test and you have a little bit of time in a class, you can take them out and study. When you know that you are doing really well in a subject, and you are failing in another, then take sometime out of studying for one class and take more time to study for the other class in which you are not doing so well. I will tell you that I am a proscrastinator. I wait until the last minute to do things, but when I do, I do them well. I have to discipline myself to study when I have a test/quiz, and you have to do the same. Do a little bit each night, make it one of your top priorities. Ask for help when you need it, and when the teacher writes something on the board or says that "you need to know this", write it down, and make sure that you do know it. If the teacher takes the time to tell you something or to write something on the board, then it must be important since the teacher spotted it out. Also, when studying, it might help to take a small break inbetween. You may discourage and stress yourself out if you dont take a small 10 min break to relax a little bit.|`|tWDCxFvkaa	HAH! i got the same grades! :)<br>  i'm in 10th grade and so far my strategy is study for tests(look at notes i took in class and look at past homework and see what i did wrong)<br>  ask my teahers questions(like if i dont understand what we r supposed to do) have help from friends and anyone else who knows the material and also ask for extra credit! thats what i plan to do for this quarter<br>  <br>  hope that helps! ^-^|`|59yuFLIMaa	This is the way to fulfil your potential:<br>  <br>  -Find out what kind of learner you are (auditory, kinesthetic, visual) <br>  -Study regularly throughout the year using revision techniques suited to your learning style<br>  -Spend a few minutes a day going over what you learnt that day making sure you understood it all<br>  -ASK! if there is some stuff you dont quite get.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|wK9LeXS7aa	Well it seems like your either not doing your homework, or you don't understand something and aren't asking for help.

YOu could say you studied when you looked at the textbook and skimmed for 5 mins. What you do is you have to be totally devoted to quizzes and tests. First, homework is a very easy grade. If you do all of it, it's sure to blast your grades higher. Then the devotion part comes in. Study constantly the week before a quiz or test. That is why your teachers tell you ahead of time. What do you do on the bus? Talk? read instead. What do you do at lunch after eating? Talk" read instead. Study as hard as you can. Take notes in class on things the teacher says more than once, almost definitely on the test. Also, the key is to listen in class. Friend telling you a joke, completely ignore her at all costs. Shes not your friend if shes damaging your grades. Listen to the teachers at all times. Everything they put on the test may or may not be in the book, but they will definitely say it at one point. Good luck.|`|OtdKzkMzaa	Talk to your teacher on what you can do to improve your grades. This may include:<br>      <br>  -Attending class more often (I'm not sure if you do or not, but I know that is my problem)<br>     <br>   -Handing in any missed work (There is a new rule now that you can hand in assignments and projects at almost anytime before report cards come out or before the assignment is handed back - it all depends on the assignment though)<br>    <br>   -Extracurricular work (Do extra work and get extra marks)<br>     <br>  - Doing your absolute best on any projects/assignments<br>     <br>  - Studying for any and all tests (Get friends in the same classes as you and form a study group, this can really help all of you improve your marks in that class)<br>  <br>  Good luck :]|`|kisMTtoYaa	Firslty don't put too much pressure on yourself!!  As long as you work hard and try your best that's all that matters, hard work and dedication always pay off, and if you get a B instead of an A well then thats ok because you tried!<br>  <br>  Secondly if you want the marks you gotta put in the effort. Make sure you do a bit of study every day, always do your homework and always speak up and ask if you dont understand something, even if it seems like a silly question, you will never know unless you ask! Even see a tutor if you need that little bit of extra help.<br>  <br>  Thirdly use a learning style that suits you. Some people learn better but re-writing nots from the book or from class, some people learn better by audio so you read your study material out loud. Some people better with visual so using flash cards or pictures to help you remember the information.<br>  <br>  Eating well and sleeping well and keeping stress levels under control are always important for study as well. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|c3MheEfKaa	guessing your a FRESHMEN!! my advice to you is TAKE NOTES that really helps allot when the teaches is giving reviews take notes of HARD WORDS or random things he says or FORMULAS things like that u know,it's usually helpful because when u study for a test n look back at dose notes it will refresh your mind..notes don't have to be clean and organized as long as you can understand them so it doesn't matter if you spell everything perfect ONLY IF THEIR VOCABULARY WORDS!!! that helped me tru out high school i never got a C-D or F just A-B's and also this is very important don't be shy to ask questions remember it's YOUR future...GOODLUCK|`|ZM5NQFQMaa	You have to get your priorities in order...i know its a bummer being in 9th grade ur more interested in boys shopping and having fun!! you can have all of that and still make time to study.

9KcBMnDXaa	If every country did not have an army then the people in every country would not have to pay for the huge cost of having arnies.   They would have more money to buy food, clothing and have nice places to live.  They would have better medical care.  They would have better jobs and would be able to give their children better educations.  They would probably live happier lives<br>  <br>  If there were no armies then countries would not need to protect themselves at all from being attacked by another countries army.<br>  <br>  But countries do have armies, and countries fear the armies of other countries so they feel they are safer if they have stronger and stronger armies.  Again, in many countries the people have little or no control over how big the arny is or how much expensive equipment it has.  Leaders make those decisions.  Leaders are usually rich and don't live where most working people live.  They want to stay in power and often they use their armies to help them stay in power.  Always the people suffer when this happens and it has been this way for thousands of years.   <br>  <br>  This is because trying to get every country to give up it's army at the same time so everyone would be safe would be like trying to hurd cats or carry frogs in a wheelbarrow.   Countries don't trust each other enough to dare try it and there is nothing that can force them all to do it.  This fear is a bad flaw in human nature but it is real and so I fear we will always have armies.<br>  <br>  Many countries have come together to call themselves the United Nations.  They have a very big building in New York where people from many countries come to try to prevent wars and help people all around the world.  The do wonderful work but they cant solve all the problems. <br>  <br>  The United States is a very very young country.  Most of the people who came here and began to start the United States were running away from bad things like being punished for their religion.  They came here because they had bad leaders who didn't care about them and who collected money from them to have armies and to have more for themselves.   The poor people who came here mostly had nothing except the clothes on their backs and hope.<br>  <br>  These people hated kings and evil rulers.  They knew that they needed local government here to manage such things maintaining roads, protecting citizens from bad people and for fire departments and all the sorts of things that towns need.  <br>  <br>  Soon enough people came that it was decided to divide up what is now the northeastern United States into states.  States are a lot like little countries.  These states did not want kings.  They wanted to govern themselves and so they set up a system of government that was run by people like themselves.  The people chose who would be in the government.  And, if they didn't like what the people in the government were doing they could vote to have someone else do it.  <br>  <br>  That is what elections are all about.   We, you and I and everyone else at election time vote on who will be our leaders.  Some we will keep.  Others we will send home.   To have this is to have a precious gift.  <br>  <br>  This is what is called a democracy.  It is a country where the people come together to make the big decisions.  The people are in charge.<br>  That is very good but it causes a lot of confusion and lots of time is wasted.<br>  <br>  Kings can make things happen with a snap of their fingers.  Democracies can't. Someone once said because of all the confusion and ineficiency that a democracy is it is bad way to govern a country, however, all the other ways to govern a country are so much worse.<br>  <br>  Yes democracy is noisy and inefficient but it is the best form we know of.  The people rule.  We try to do it out in the open so all the people can see what is going on.  There are no secret police.  We have courts that work very hard to be fair.  You can say what you think here<br>  We have newspapers and telivision news.  A big part of their job is to<br>  find out what is going on in government and tell us honestly what they know.

My wife went to a Junior college and after two years got a full scholorship to a private four-year college.

83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	I think that you understand that by allowing this to take place, you have failed in your responsibility as a teacher. With 45 students in the class, you cannot allow a small group to interfere in any way with your command of the space. The very first day that this was a problem you should have held them after class. Then you should have specifically told them that you wanted them to sit apart, to not work in groups together, and to behave professional. If you assign groups or seating you should have immediately split them up. Then you needed to specifically keep an eye on them in the next few classes and immediately when they got out of line, used the most severe authority you have. In many university classes the instructor has the authority to remove a student from class if they are disruptive. One of this group should have been dismissed from class on the second day that they were disruptive. <br>  <br>  This is not vindictive or cruel. You have a responsibility to the other 44 students to see that they are in a positive learning environment. And you have a responsibility to the disruptive students to see that they learn a new attitude. When everyone understands that you mean business and will not stand for any nonsense, then you will get cooperation. Also, I agree that if you have a personal relationship with the students you will get better cooperation. You should learn the names of the students as fast as possible. By the third or fourth class you should know the names, majors, hometowns, dorms, whatever information you can get, about any potential trouble makers. Turn them from troublemakers into guided students. <br>  <br>  Teaching is not lecturing. It is a management skill. And, that skill can be learned by practice, and pedagogically. Talk to some good teachers in your department to get tips. <br>  <br>  You can do this. But many of us who won teaching awards started out tearing our hair out over our 'bad' students. |`|9Sx4PzBmaa	Start grading them on classroom "participation" - if they can't participate properly give them a zero.  Or simply tell them if they act like that they are getting a zero for the assignment.  Or kick them out of the room if they are disrupting their fellow students who are trying to learn and then mark them absent.  Too bad if they fail the class, that's their choice.<br>  <br>  In college teaching you are a little bit more free. You're not a behavor manager like a high school teacher is.  Its not your job to make the students behave...they are adults now and should know how to behave.  You teach and its their choice to learn or not.  If they choose not to learn give them a zero.|`|zeaCzn0saa	Im a student currently, just about to finish my final year of schooling(YAY)<br>  <br>  i can tell you the most important thing is to follow through on your punishment.

I'm pretty sure that they have a degree program in Event Planning which is what you want. The average student at JWU is not a genius,so you do not need to be in the top ten of your class to get in. It is a private school, so it is more expensive than a state college, but it is not as expensive as most private schools. <br>  <br>  They have a website that tells a lot about the school and if you just call them up or email they would be happy to send you lots of information so that you can make up your mind.

Almost every school has a faculty member assigned to this duty. That person will help you organize your plans for how to get all your prerequisites done. <br>  <br>  In most cases, you would take general chemistry with labs for the two terms of your freshman year, calculus in the fall and human anatomy in the spring term. Then sophomore year you would take organic chem with lab for two terms and biology with lab for two terms and statistics in the spring term while preparing for your PCATs.<br>  <br>  If this sounds like a tough schedule, it is! But if you want to go to pharm school you need to be good enough to do this or else, what are you going to do when you get to pharmaceutical chemistry, advanced chemotherapy, physiology, etc in pharm school?

All of these young people are smart, hardworking and successful. You get out what you put in. <br>  <br>  It's true, though, that there are a lot of US schools where you can get through without doing much of anything. Too bad. You only get one shot at life.

The standard for giving a high school degree has dropped - anyone can get one, it's not really 'earning' it anymore.  Schools get more money if they pass more students, so they tell their teachers not to fail students and try to let everyone graduate.  We need to start giving more money to the failing schools, not the ones that are already doing well.  We need to get rid of yearly testing, so teachers don't have to teach to the test.  And we need some national standards in fields like English, math, and science - we can't just leave it up to the individual school boards (look what happened to Kansas).
83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Anyone who goes to college can take a course in piano, but to major in piano, to be a major in Performance Music, you have to be quite good. I'd say about the equivalent of 8 to 10 years of serious lessons. If you can play one of the commonly played Chopin Nocturnes properly, then you are probably about the right level to start as a piano major. During your college years you will have to do several individual recitals and be judged on your performance. <br>  <br>  You have to understand that there are very few jobs for people with degrees in piano. The competition is going to be fierce. Only the very best will survive. I know one kid who was on that PBS TV program that features excellent child musical prodigies and he decided that he was not good enough to major in piano.

And good luck!|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	I think things look pretty good for you. But you should apply for scholarships. Admission is need blind - the people who review you for admission will probably not even see your financial ad application, so they will not consider whether you have or have not asked for a scholarship. If they dont want to give you a scholarship, then they won't give you one. But that should not have any impact whatsoever on whether you are granted admission or not. Applying will NOT "drastically lower your chances. If you have doubts about this you should directly ask the U Chi admissions people if a request for scholarship help factors into the decision. <br>  <br>  U of Chicago is definitely one of the great universities in the world, even more highly respected outside the US than within the US. Good luck in your application. I think you sound like the kind of student they would like.

Mexican universities do not teach Canadian or British law. <br>  <br>  To be a practicing psychologist, you need to have a license, usually supervised by some medical authority.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	There are a number of reasons to go to a more prestigious school.  The principal one is that it gives you more options than do other schools, both while you are in school and after graduation.  While you are in school, the schools are well-funded and thus can offer you the best of equipment, the best professors, and the like.  They can bring in lots of incredible speakers, the best of arts opportunities, etc.  There are scholarships for students to do overseas programs or special research projects, and if you wanted to get a job over the summer, you could almost be assured of doing something interesting, rather than having to work at the local Gap or McDonald's!  Networking at these schools can be amazing too.  Your roommate's dad may be a major government official, or her mom the CEO of a major company.  When you graduate, every company and organization is delighted to interview graduates of your school (which is not true of many colleges).  When interviewers and eventually employers are impressed by the school from which you graduated, they tend to assume you are doing a good job, and you would have to really screw up to change that impression, as opposed to the graduate of an average school who would still have to prove him/herself.    <br>  <br>  Classes are usually better at better schools.  Yes, there are good and bad teachers at every school, but what is considered good and bad at each level is very different, so no, colleges are by no means homogeneous (take it from someone with degrees from 4 schools and who has been on faculty at 8 during my career).  I got my Ph.D. at a prestige school, and once heard the Dean describe it this way.  At a top school, you learn directly from those who made the discoveries themselves.  At a reasonably good school, you learn from those who learned from the people who made the discoveries.  At a lesser school, you learn from the people who read about the discoveries.  To hear directly from the person who made a discovery is exciting, because you can find out the story behind it, you sense their excitement, and so forth.  When you learn from someone who just read about the discovery, it is less personal, and you wonder what you are gaining over having read about it yourself!<br>  <br>  No, it doesn't all come down to money. Not everyone describes a "better" job as one which will earn you more money.  For many people, the good job is the one which offers the most interesting opportunities, even if this means earning less.  A lot of people in government service or with NGOs, or those of us in education, for example, may have given up opportunities which might have paid far better in order to live a more fulfilling life.  If you want money, yes, that is available to you, and the fact that the average graduate of a prestigious school is usually making more than the average graduate of another school attests to the fact that many people ARE looking for money, but while that is available to you, so are many low-paid but interesting jobs which may not be open to others.|`|C7VdefhKaa	Depends. <br>  <br>  Prestige is "considered a foot in the door" for job and grad school opportunities. In this economic climate, that means a lot to people. <br>  <br>  Prestige can also mean a school's been universally recognized for being amazing -- wisdom of the masses, or elites, depending on who you ask. <br>  <br>  (I myself think the Ivy League is bit overhyped, but I won't deny they're good schools)|`|83566101c2bc0610f8a9ba8d9dd08cafaa	Elite schools (the Ivies, plus other elite schools like U Chicago, Duke, Stanford, MIT) have opportunities that go far beyond the classroom. The professors you get are brilliant and cutting edge, but it is the networking both with your peers and with alumni that is a huge advantage. And the facilities and funding... two of my kids waltzed into graduate fellowships that paid full rides for their first graduate degrees based on the names of their top ten undergrad schools. And one of them received over $20,000 of research support and had his own laboratory to work in when he was just a sophomore at a top ten school. When you have billions of dollars in endowment, you can do that for your students. It doesn't happen at Big State Uni. His roommate was an econ major and made enough money day trading from their dorm room to pay all the tuition and costs for his college expenses... at Big State Uni you are more likely to have the drunken roommate from h***.  When I visited I met all the kids on his dorm hall and everyone was practically a genius. There is a reason why so many families of successful business people and professional parents want to pay $50,000 a year for their kids to go to elite schools, and it isnt just for the name. <br>  <br>  ps majoring in history isnt such a bad plan. When Forbes Magazine did a survey they found that history majors who became businessmen made an average salary that was higher than kids who had majored in business in college. If you think about what history consists of, you can understand why. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  . |`|hfH8c1LWaa	why not get a little ahead in life?<br>  if u apply for a job and its between u and another with identical everything accept one went to somewhere like USC, UCLA, or even Harvard and the other went to state, the Harvard guy would get the job hands down. <br>  i wouldnt say its for bragging rights, but hey if thats what u wanna do then by all means go ahead :)<br>  it shows that ur serious about education too, meaning that u had the skills and the grades to even get accepted into a prestigious school.<br>  <br>  but who am i to judge, u can go to state or whatever and ill stick with my prestigious school, and 4-5 years down the line ill be ur boss, see u then :D|`|cMZEmpp0aa	Actually, sometimes the name does carry you through, and whether you like to admit it or not the ability to network (and to tap into a good, active network) is extremely important in the modern world. Sometimes being a hard-working person isn't enough. And yes, very often the education at a prestigious university is better than that at a less-prestigious university (though not always, of course). So if you don't want to go to a prestigious school to feel better about yourself for not being a suck-up, or whatever it is you think people who go to prestigious schools become, that's fine. But remember that impressing people actually gets you somewhere in this world.

Even if he had succeeded at Antietam or Gettysburg, the additional Union armies that were available in Washington and the Northeast far outnumbered him and - in contrast to the South - the North had large reserves of manpower that were never used.

OK, so when you do the quote in your paper you do it like this <br>  "Baskidball(sic) is my favorite sport" said Jonny Jones.<br>  and then you have to be sure that Jonny Jones is listed in your Bibliography or Works Cited at the end of the paper.|`|UXzNsl17aa	It really depends on the teacher.  Although you can't really get in trouble for using a direct quote from the book, some teachers may be uncomfortable with the quotes you choose.

mCpC4Zjbaa	P-E-R-S-U-A-S-I-O-N is the act of influencing and getting people to act in the direction of your desired outcome. The greater number of people you influence the more likely you are of obtaining your desired results. It is also like a tidal wave. If you impact a lot of people other people will begin to conform to the new social norm. There is pressure on people to fit in. <br>  <br>  Although the outcome was horrific, you can look at Hitler as an example. By using persuasion techniques and mass communication he accomplished things that are completely unimaginable... even scary to imagine.

I teach English in South Korea and have for many years.  Many of my colleagues are from the Philippines, Australia, Russia, and New Zealand.  They have their own native passports with an E-2 visa, which allows them to teach in this country.  Obtaining this visa requires you showing proof that you hold a four year university degree only.  If you have TEFL or ESL skills certificates, that is a plus.  Good luck.|`|gRObakpZaa	No, you need a passport before you can travel overseas.

5EGm6ZLhaa	She would apply to schools that she is interested in as a transfer student, her credits may or may not transfer and if they do, then it is a possibility that they all won't.<br>  <br>  If you want to make this as smooth as possible I would suggest contacting prospective universities ahead of time and asking about their transfer procedures for foreign transcripts. Some schools may require you to send them off to a third party for evaluation, some will just request that you send them to school as part of the application for admission.<br>  <br>  NB: Some universities have this information on their website, so it could be a good idea to start there first, remember that not all universities will want the transcripts sent to the same 3rd party company, so don't assume that one procedure fits all, because you could very well be wrong in that assumption.
AA12074269	Are you saying that you wish to do year 12 in Australia?

lPdCTyOAaa	Sorry for being an ***, but having the best Liberal Studies program is sort of like being the best surfer in Montana.<br>  <br>  What's more, you're not going to find a lot of excellence in the CSU system.  Sure, the forestry program at Humboldt is solid, the architecture programs at the Cal Poly campuses are good, and hard sciences...well, science students at universities great and mediocre have fairly similar educations.<br>  <br>  A good Liberal Studies program...well, to be brutally honest, it's sort of a half-assed degree.  It doesn't matter where you get it.  And while it may be that the relative strength of a specific department at a particular university might matter more than the university's overall reputation, no one cares about the relative quality of Liberal Studies programs.  The overall reputation of the university will be more important.<br>  <br>  Some CSU schools ARE better than others.  Cal Poly SLO is the best, followed by Cal Poly Pomona (my alma mater).  Humboldt also attracts better students than the rest of the system, though going there tags you with sort of a hippie/granola/pot-smoking reputation (lovely part of the state though).  I spent a couple of quarters at CSULA and thought it was crap; it was a black hole of the intellect.  (I certainly didn't find that to be the case at Cal Poly Pomona, which had a vastly superior student body.)  I've heard from some people who went there that CSU Dominguez Hills is even worse. <br>  <br>  Beyond that, I think going to one campus is as good as another.<br>  <br>  One other benefit to going to Cal Poly...outside of this state, CSU doesn't have a lot of name recognition.  To people on the east coast, many of whom thinks that civilization ends at the Hudson River, Cal Poly is the same as Cal Tech.  I moved to Boston after graduation and when I told people where I went to school I got impressed looks, when really it was no place special.  Solid, but not special - just like hundreds of other colleges.  <br>  <br>  Who knows, maybe if I'd said I'd gone to Cal State LA they would have been similarly ignorant and made a comment about the Bruins.

pUVb1w8Haa	I know the exact feeling you have with being bored in what your doing for a living. My situation was similar except for the wife not being on board. Additionally, I walked away from a 100K plus job. I up and moved my family wife and 4 year old 2500 miles to go to law school in Michigan. I am in my final term and graduate in late April. <br>  <br>  A couple of things you may want to consider:<br>  <br>  1. Law school will likely cost you 100K plus in student loans, leaving you with an 800-1000 month student loan payment. If you did take a 40K public interest job you would be worse off than you are now.<br>  <br>  2. If you have a serious AD HD problem, you won't make through law school. <br>  <br>  Considering that, you should talk to your wife and let her know how unhappy you will continue to be not pursuing your dreams. If I were you, I would retake the LSAT (since its probably been more than 5 years since you originally sat for it, if you sat at all) apply to the local schools and a couple better schools and see what happens. Once you have all the info, you and your wife can make a good decision.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

AA10409832	Paraphrasing is giving a "sense" of what you have read, without directly quoting it.  For instance, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.  You don't want to quote the entire address, but you  tell the reader what he said in your own words.  You can do the same with any kind of a quote.  It's a re-hashing of the quote in your own words, making it shorter and more understandable.  You can use it anytime you don't want to use direct quotes.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	Paraphrasing is the same thing as summarizing - it means repeating something, but using fewer words.|`|oTxufwbEaa	Paraphrasing is putting someone else's work into your own words.  It is very often used by students in research papers.  You must still give credit to the original author, but you can save time and space by simply summarizing his idea in your own words.  Use it when the original quotation is too long, or because you need to change the wording because you are writing to a different type audience.  You might also use paraphrasing when you can say it better!

0e8mlXveaa	I'm 36 and decided to do an Access course at my local college to go to Uni this September. It's actually easier to get offers as a mature student as they have a number of places to fill for mature students and I was offered places at all 5 of my choices and one of which is apparently notoriously difficult to get into. I do recommend an Access course even though you are only 22 as it teaches you a lot of skills that the uni's like and it's a great foundation for higher education. Most of my class mates are using it for specific pathways which are vocational such as nursing or teaching but I've done a combined studies course which means I have studied Biology, Sociology, Psychology and English at Level 3 (A level) and had the opportunity to resit maths and English GCSE's too to attain a better result than the first time around.

l5HI6NFoaa	Self control refers to the ability to control human behavior through the exertion of will. Self-control is required in order to inhibit impulsivity, and has been a recurrent theme throughout history, culture, and philosophy, where it is considered a key to volition (psychology) and free will.<br>  <br>  In contemporary psychology it is sometimes referred to as self-regulation, and exerting self-control through the executive functions in decision making is thought to deplete a resource in the ego.<br>  <br>  For Example:<br>                     <br>                      Human self-control<br>  <br>  Human self-control research is typically modeled by using a token economy system in which human participants choose between tokens for one choice and usually more tokens for a delayed choice. Different results were being obtained for humans and non-humans, with the latter appearing to maximize their overall reinforcement despite delays, with the former being sensitive to changes in delay. The difference in research methodologies with humans - using tokens or conditioned reinforcers - and non-humans using sub-primary reinforcers suggested procedural artifacts as a possible suspect. One aspect of these procedural differences was the delay to the exchange period (Hyten et al 1994).[10] Non-human subjects can, and would, access their reinforcement immediately. The human subjects had to wait for an "exchange period" in which they could exchange their tokens for money, usually at the end of the experiment. When this was done with pigeons they responded much like humans in which males have less control than females (Jackson & Hackenberg 1996).[11] However, Logue, (1995),who is discussed more below, points out that in her study done on self-control it was male children that responded with less self control than female children. She then states, that in adulthood, for the most part, the sexes equalize on their ability to exhibit self control. This could suggest a human being's ability to exert more self control as they mature and become more aware of the consequences associated with impulsivity. This suggestion is furthered examined below.<br>  <br>  Most of the research in the field of self control assumes that self control is in general better than impulsiveness. Some developmental psychologists argue that this is normal, and people age from infants, who have no ability to think of the future, and hence no self control or delayed gratification, to adults. As a result almost all research done on this topic is from this standpoint and very rarely is impulsiveness the more adaptive response in experimental design.<br>  <br>  More recently some in the field of developmental psychology have begun to think of self control in a more complicated way that takes into account that sometimes impulsiveness is the more adaptive response. In their view, a normal individual should have the capacity to be either impulsive or controlled depending on which is the most adaptive.|`|Iwk92vqyaa	"egoism" [?] = "a doctrine that individual self-interest is the actual motive of all conscious action / a doctrine that individual self-interest is the valid end of all actions"<br>  ...and a couple more there that don't fit anything like 'self control'...<br>  <br>  "eggheadedness" [?] = being like or being an "egghead" = "intellectual, highbrow"...<br>  <br>  "egregious" [?] = only an 'archaic' (very old) meaning of "distinguished"...<br>  <br>  "egis" [?] = another spelling for "aegis" = "protection, controlling or conditioning influence / control or guidance especially by an individual, group, or system"...<br>  <br>  Hmm. <br>  Thought you needed a word beginning with 'eg' meaning 'self control.'

First I carefully read the journal article I'll be discussing. Next I take a break and work on something else. Then I get myself a caffeinated beverage and some kind of sweet treat (usually it's chocolate-covered raisins but today I'm in a coffee shop having just finished a toffee almond bar). Often it won't be until ten or fifteen minutes after I've eaten that I really get into a groove with the writing. Then I write the entire post, usually for an hour or two straight, pausing only to produce the graphics and demos accompanying the story. The hard part is finished, and the final formatting, editing, and posting can be done at leisure, sometimes even while I'm working on other projects or getting the kids started on their homework.<br>  <br>  The part that really requires self-discipline is the writing itself. Usually I disconnect the internet in my house, or even head out to a coffee shop (one of the few remaining with no internet access) to remove all possible distractions. The self-control necessary for writing is well-known, and many writers, such as the eminent lexicographer Samuel Johnson, have discussed how excruciating the writing process is for them (Johnson once said "No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money."). But self-control is required for many more mundane tasks as well. Try to watch this silent movie (QuickTime Required) of me reading this post while ignoring the words that flash periodically in the lower-right corner of the screen:<br>  <br>  It's not easy, is it? It almost feels like work, just to avoid reading. While reading is a mental process too, it feels like we're expending more energy avoiding reading than we would to do the reading itself.<br>  <br>  Maybe there's something to that feeling. Research led by Roy Baumeister has found that people who've resisted eating cookies gave up sooner on a task requiring persistence compared to those who succumbed to temptation and ate the cookies. Other research has associated low blood glucose levels with poor performance on the Stroop task -- another task that requires people to avoid reading. Is it literally true that the sugar in our blood fuels our ability to control our impulses?<br>  <br>  Matthew Gailliot, along with Baumeister and six other researchers, asked 103 psychology students to fast for three hours before watching a video like the one I showed above. Half the students were told to ignore the words, while the rest weren't required to exercise any self-control. Blood glucose levels were measured before and after this task. The students exercising self-control had significantly lower glucose levels after watching the movie, while the other students did not. In another experiment, students performed the Stroop task after watching the movie. The students who had to resist reading the words performed significantly worse on the Stroop task; their lower blood glucose levels after watching the movie and avoiding reading seemed to impair performance.<br>  <br>  In another experiment, a new group of 62 students watched the movie, again divided into groups who watched normally or controlled their attention by avoiding reading. Then everyone was offered a glass of Kool-aid lemonade. Half the lemonade was sweetened with sugar, while half was sweetened with Splenda, which does not affect blood glucose levels. Since glucose takes about 10 minutes to be absorbed by the brain, everyone was given a 10-minute distractor task, then given an 80-item Stroop task. Here are the results:<br>  It's not easy, is it?

lkPY7n7Faa	An observation is what you observe happening while the experiment, or lab is going on. It doesn't include any ideas connected to why you see what you see, it's literally you saying what you can see, hear, taste, smell or touch while the research is going on. Things you can measure  are a good way to help you describe what is going on. <br>  <br>  The experimental group is the group of people, trees, macaques or whatever you are doing the experiment to. This is in contrast to the control group who, in a clinical trial, you would give the placebo to. The reason for them is so that you can see what would happen naturally without your experiment's interference so that you can really compare the results and get a better idea of what is going on. <br>  <br>  Independent research is research that is not funded by the government.

"Something going on at home" could mean that she thought maybe one of your parents had lost their job and you were worried, you had a sibling on drugs, or your parents were fighting with one another.  And she wouldn't be able to find out about this without checking with your parents.  If she truly hated you, she would ignore you, or yell at you, not kneel next to you and ask you why you weren't working.  You are very lucky to have a teacher like this.  She may save your life, if you let her, because you certainly won't get anywhere by not doing homework, being rude to teachers, or talking with friends during lessons.|`|AyGHEFJkaa	Uuum i'm pretty sure she was just worried about you...worried about your welfare if there was something going on at home.

sNIjyocuaa	Talk to your teacher (as well as other VCE English teachers).<br>  Ask them if they could give you additional essay topics to write on and if they would mark these extra papers for you. Most teachers are more than willing to do this (many seem to see it as a personal achievement when a student in their class excels) and you may find it useful to get a second or third opinion on your writing style from other teachers (especially as a lot of SACs are cross-marked). Please talk to your teacher about consulting other teachers before you do it, I have seen a teacher get very hurt over students going 'behind their back' (I know it sounds silly, but it's true). Don't forget to practice all of the tasks on the exam, not just essay writing!<br>  <br>  In addition to this, start writing quotes out now, the more quotes that you can memorise the better! You don't know what the topic will be on your exam, so be prepared with quotes that you can use to validate several points.<br>  <br>  I would download the exams from previous years and practice those, making sure that you follow the time limit. It is important that you get used to writing under time constraints. Having said that, I found that I had ample time in the final exam. Also submit any previous exams that you complete for marking- your teacher probably won't provide as much feedback as they would on essays that they have set but they will still give you some feedback.<br>  <br>  Also, remember that your SACs are very important! Make sure that you are well rested and prepared for each one.<br>  <br>  Finally, don't stress out too much! I didn't do any of the things that I have suggested you try and I still did very well, you don't have to do everything. I would strongly recommend that you speak to your teacher, they will be able to tell you if you are on track for a 30+ study score or if you need to put in a bit of extra work. A study score of 30+ is achievable, I'm sure that you will get there!|`|VMIR9IoKaa	Prac Exams are definitely a good idea. I think i only ever did one, but i got a 37 for English. I used to make notes on the computer which i'd print out. I'd print out dot points on character descriptions with words to describe them. then i'd print out quotes for those characters. quotes i could of course remember, and that were relative to more than one thing (e.g a theme also). Otherwise there are too many to remember. Then i'd do the same with themes. I'd write up on each theme, then dotpoint relative quotes and examples for that. <br>  Then I'd go away and read lots of other people's essay examples which were good for giving me different ideas and approaches to certain topics. Sparknotes and Pinkmonkey were really helpful.<br>  <br>  Are you still doing issues in VCE English? I have a feeling it's creative writing now. If so, my suggestion is to learn a new word everyday to improve your vocab and read lots of books! Don't stick to one style of book either, because I remember when I was at school we were sometimes asked to write a story mimicking a certain author's style. Also, writing from your own experiences can also be a good idea if you don't feel you are very creative or would struggle to come up with something when under time. Even if you don't think you have anything terribly exciting to put into a story. Seriously... I got A+ just for writing a story (that went no where, mind you) about standing in the queue for the Ufizi Museum in Florence. Just write about whatever you've got! <br>  <br>  I hope i've been some help. Good luck!

You understood your weakness, which is coming in the way of your effective studying - then it will be easier to get rid of that.

Composing literature in palindromes is an example of constrained writing. The word "palindrome" was coined from Greek roots palin (π?λιν; "back") and dromos (δρóμο?; "way, direction") by English writer Ben Jonson in the 1600s. The actual Greek phrase to describe the phenomenon is karkinikê epigrafê (καρκινικ? επιγραφ?; crab inscription), or simply karkiniêoi (καρκινι?οι; crabs), alluding to the backward movement of crabs, like an inscription which can be read backwards.|`|EvyY3dUNaa	The word palindrome is derived from the Greek palíndromos, meaning running back again (palín = AGAIN + drom–, drame?n = RUN). A palindrome is a word or phrase which reads the same in both directions. Some simple examples are:<br>  <br>  RACECAR DEED LEVEL PIP <br>  ROTOR CIVIC POP MADAM <br>  EYE NUN RADAR TOOT <br>  <br>  Words like LIVE and STRAW (which read EVIL and WARTS backwards) are not themselves palindromes but the "phrases" LIVE EVIL and STRAW WARTS are. A palindrome is not necessarily a single word.<br>  <br>  The longest single English word in common usage which is a palindrome is REDIVIDER, although the contrived chemical term DETARTRATED is two letters longer. In Finnish there is a 25-letter palindromic word: SOLUTOMAATTIMITTAAMOTULOS which means the result from a measurement laboratory for tomatoes, although technically it is a compound of four words. There is also the equally long SAIPPUAKUPPINIPPUKAUPPIAS which means soap cup trader.<br>  <br>  When creating reversible sentences, it is usually accepted that punctuation and word spacings are ignored, and so the famous MADAM, I'M ADAM is a valid palindrome.<br>  <br>  <br>  Palindrome Varieties<br>  There are two other types of palindrome, although neither is particularly common. The first is the word-unit palindrome. As the name suggests, these are palindromes in which the words form the same sentence in either direction, e.g. WOMEN UNDERSTAND MEN; FEW MEN UNDERSTAND WOMEN. Occasionally these are also traditional palindromes, such as in I DID, DID I? but this only happens when each word is itself a traditional palindrome.<br>  The other kind of palindrome is the mirrored palindrome. These are palindromes which are graphically reversible. Not all letters in mirrored palindromes necessarily have symmetry about a vertical axis (A, H, I, M, O, T, U, V, W, X) since some letters are (more or less) mirror images of others (e.g. L and J). Therefore a mirrored palindrome is not necessarily also a traditional palindrome. Punctuation and spaces cannot be ignored when creating mirrored palindromes. When reversed A TOYOTA becomes ATOYOT A which, strictly speaking, is not the same. WOT TOW, although fairly meaningless, is a valid mirrored palindrome. Of course, with this type of palindrome, it is important whether upper or lower case letters are used: bid is a mirrored palindrome, but BID is not.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  World's Longest Palindrome Sentence?  17,826 words<br>  <br>  <br>  A 17,826 Word Palindrome (or Palindromic Sentence)<br>   <br>  A man, a plan, a cameo, Zena, Bird, Mocha, Prowel, a rave,<br>  Uganda, Wait, a lobola, Argo, Goto, Koser, Ihab, Udall, a revocation,<br>  Ebarta, Muscat, eyes, Rehm, a cession, Udella, E-boat, OAS, a mirage,<br>  IPBM, a caress, Etam, FCA, a mica, Ojai, Lebowa, Yaeger, a barge, Rab,<br>  Alsatian, a mod, Adv, a rps, Ileane, Valeta, Grenada, Hetty, Fayme,<br>  REME, HCM, Tsan, Owena, Tamar, Yompur, Isa, Nil, Lorrin, Riksdag,<br>  Mona, Ronn, O'Conner, Kirk, an okay, Nafl, Lira, Robi, Rame, FIFA, a<br>  need, Rodi, Muharram, Ober, a coma, carri, Hwang, Taos, Salado, Olfe,<br>  Camag, Kdar, a hdkf, Jemina, Nadler, Ehud, Rutan, a baster, Ebn,<br>  aedegi, a gals, Ira, Tepper, a minim, a gowd, Ulda, Ogawa, TSgt,<br>  Callida, Rodl, Ewart, seraphs, Ain, Newgate, Vaden, navettes, Sabah,<br>  Swat, Luci, Pam, Arda, pools, a boar, Akira, Gally, CSC, Avalon, a<br>  tuba, AAM, Artima, AFB, Selah, wellies, Ronald, BArch, nullos, Uni, an<br>  aet, Nadabus, Tyree, Poop, Sennar, CAB, a nanny, Let, Efahan, Dasya,<br>  Moon, Ikaria, Nam, Lamar, Egor, Rover, Tanana, Loki, MIP, PharD,<br>  endia, rates, Punan, Eba, Alva, Paine, BEF, Fagan, nugae, taws, Una,<br>  Woll, a tab, CSE, Kamerad, YCL, a melt, Diehl, Lewellen, Sacci, Reggi,<br>  RFA, BSA, naoi, Kuyp, Oceanic, Sipple, Yalu, Kosey, nota, talers,<br>  Frida, a wab, Musset, Aoede, Erick, a reign, Attica, Marge, Leta, Mat,<br>  Naboth, Saphra, Gila, Arany, Costa, Fasta, Mabel, Udine, Derte,<br>  Medill, Erotes, RuPaul, Uzzi, Waler, Omak, a kaif, Freed, a doc, a<br>  marga, Nilla, Dole, USPO, Ogata, tubas, somata, Dash, Danika, Salida,<br>  Fiji, Emili, Kazak, Oder, CAC, Ilocanos, Nudd, Uda, Susette, Diskin,<br>  Numitor, Munn, a tsarina, Valle, Soraya, Masan, Ezaria, Teri, Luks,<br>  UNDRO, Naida, Wal, a major, Stelu, OGO, Dilan, Iapetus, an areg, a<br>  jacal, Nessi, R.

l5HI6NFoaa	It is a fact of life that some people suffer from a Lack of Confidence. Unfortunately this problem holds back people who, in other ways are highly qualified but are failing to use their full potential.<br>  <br>  Without confidence to promote yourself as competent and efficient you are losing credibility, opportunities, status and many more valuable assets. You can overcome this problem by taking action NOW!!<br>  <br>  Many issues are responsible for the lack of self confidence. They have to be identified before any improvement can be made. Some of the factors which cause lack of self-confidence are:-<br>  <br>  - Fear.<br>  <br>  - Self Belief.<br>  <br>  - Personality.<br>  <br>  - Attitude.<br>  <br>  - Communication Skills.<br>  <br>  - Education.<br>  <br>  - Low Self Esteem.<br>  <br>  These are just some of the problems, but obviously there are others which you need to confront.<br>  <br>  Often outside help is required to boost your self confidence as most people find it difficult to carry out self analysis by being objective, accurate and critical of themselves. But remember you can overcome some of the causes with simple steps outlined below. At times professional help is required and is readily available on the Internet and from other sources. This help can be extremely beneficial when properly used and can greatly increase your prospects in employment in addition to improving the quality of your life.<br>  <br>  Let us examine the reasons listed above to find how to overcome them.<br>  <br>  FEAR The most common fear is fear of failure. whether it is in employment, sport, home life, socialising, communicating, just the fear of failure can prevent you achieving success. the fear of failure is purely in the mind, and once you convince yourself that is so you will be able to start making progress. Then you will be able to take chances. You will be able to look for more responsibility at work and as your confidence grows you will start to look for promotion in your job. If you play a sport, accept you are not going to be a top professional, but also decide you will be as good as you can be. In other words, accept the level of your expertise and enjoy it. Be confident about it. After all, we can't all be Tiger Woods or Wayne Rooney. Millions of people who are not good at their favourite sport are able to derive tremendous satisfaction from it.<br>  <br>  If your home life is suffering through your insecurity, do a reality check, analyse what you think are your short comings, and can you improve it. YES YOU CAN. Get help, talk to your friends, relatives, and partners, and ask for their opinion. There is no shame in asking acquaintances, friends and relatives for advice. Socialising can sometimes be difficult for people with little confidence, particularly if you tend to be shy. One of the best ways of building confidence is, when in a social situation, to listen to what people are saying. If you feel you have a point to make or an opinion, speak up. But do be careful and make sure your view is relevant to the discussion. If not, say nothing, and listen. You will always find someone or some group who are talking about a subject you know something about. You don't have to be an expert to mention a valid point or to display an interest in the subject being discussed. Simply by showing an interest you will find socialising becomes much easier. It's important to always try and keep up to date with current events. Obviously not all current events, but ones which interest you. That way you will always be able to make a contribution to a discussion or small talk at a social function. If you follow the tips in this article you will go a long way to improving your self confidence.<br>  <br>  Don't forget. The only fear of fear is fear itself.|`|jJAbRdY8aa	that you will get in course of time, be with more educated ppl. read more books
