20061113104415AA629T6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are you Surpised?	Harry was delighted when he found a young woman who accepted his proposal of marriage as he was sensitive about his wooden leg and a bit afraid no one would have him. In fact, he couldn`t bring himself to tell his fiancee` about his leg when he slipped the ring on her finger, nor when she bought the dress, nor when they picked the time and place. All he kept saying was, "Darling, I`ve got a big surprise for you," at which she blushed and smiled bewitchingly.      The wedding night came and went, and the young couple were at last alone in their hotel room. "Now don`t forget, Harry, you promised me a big surprise," said the bride.      Unable to say a word, Harry turned out the lights, unstrapped his wooden leg, slipped into bed, and placed his wife`s hand on the stump.      "Hmmmmm," she said softly, "that IS a surprise. But pass me the Vaseline and I`ll see what I can do!"

I'm a guy by the way! :)      But when some (I said some) WOMEN play hard to get, and do it too much and the guy stops chasing and gives up interest, why do some women become all of a sudden become obsessed with the GUY?      Why couldn't you just show how you really felt and stopped running so much, now that he's not interested anymore now you stop playing hard to get, and WON'T leave the guy alone.      And yes I'm speaking from personal experience this has happened twice to me, and these WOMEN become obsessed and feel horrible and everything else that I stopped chasing them, but how do you think I felt when you kept running,  I felt HORRIBLE geez.

20061121113328AACtmZu	Family & Relationships;Family	What do you think?	My cousin (11 years old and male) wanted to see if he could set a record. He wants to see if he could set the record of having your feet tickled for the longest time. I told him he can't, because of the fact that someone who is not ticklish could say they are and last forever having their feet tickled. He refuses to admit he is wrong, but I do give it to him, he has really ticklish feet and can last a while. I can't even touch his socked feet without him giggling. He had his sister tickle his feet (with him wrapped in a blanket with his socked feet sticking out of one end) for 5 minutes and 32 seconds and he was in complete hysterics, his eyes were watering. I just want to know if the public can tell me how long their kids, cousins, or brothers can last having their feet tickled and how ticklish they are. Just to see where my cousin is at (Even though I still think its a pointless record)

Am Dienstag fahre ich dann für knapp 3 Wochen weg, mindestens aber für 1 1/2. Ich würde sie eigentlich vorher noch gerne sehen, aber eigentlich habe ich überhaupt keine Zeit und zum anderen w?re es ja auch bl?d jetzt eine Beziehung anzufangen. Wenn ich mich aber mit ihr treffe und ihr nicht sage, dass ich sie so wunderbar finde was dann? Ich k?nnte sie maximal für ein paar Stunden treffen. Wir haben lediglich einen Abend zusammen auf einer Party verbracht, aber wir haben einfach so gut miteinander harmoniert. Am liebsten würde ich das ganze jetzt erstmal auf Eis legen bis ich wieder da bin, aber andererseits würde ich sie auch sehr gerne nochmal sehen.

GUYS, WOULD YOU BE JEALOUS IN HIS SHOES TOO??WILL THIS RUIN THEIR FRIENDSHIP CUZ I WILL FEEL HORRIBLE IF IT DOES??    Should I break up with his friend and date him?? Even considering our past??
20061127192251AA1BwWq	Family & Relationships;Friends	Where can I go with her?	I have a best friend in school, who's female. She's not my girlfriend. I haven't seen her in a while because she had classes far away from mine, but she transferred to a class recently near one of mines. I want to go hang out with her somewhere, but I don't want to take her anywhere that'll seem "date-like". Where can we go to have fun that wouldn't seem like a date?
20061218181521AAabJQw	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this a good apology?	Dear Friends,      I'm sending this to all of you, and I know it is a long time coming. I write to apologize for potentially offending you when I deleted my facebook profile a few weeks ago abruptly without notifying any of you. This was inconsiderate on my part and I sincerely apologize for any offense taken and I truly hope that it does not affect any aspect of our friendship. I value each and every one of you and our friendship deeply and did not want to jeapordize that by leaving this unaddressed. I do not intend to put a profile back up, and I know that because of that, I have already and will soon lose contact with many of you. However, despite that, I want you all to know that I enjoyed and continue to enjoy my time with each and every single one of you. Though we may never see or even talk through the internet ever again, I hope you all know that I admire you and value our friendship and wish you all the best in the future. Again I am very sorry. Thank you.

20061206091336AANPZmu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why am I so lonely?	I'm speaking to you with a soft whisper, kneeling down beside you as I look right into your eyes and share with you who I am. The truth, I haven't had the gift of having a good woman in a very long time. I'd do anything to know the feeling of being loved by someone who's gentle and loving. she wonders why I look away with sadness upon my face. I look away because when I hurt, tears have no mercy on my eyes but when I smile there isn't a brighter moment in my world than the vision of this woman. I want to trust her so I ask her from the depths of my soul to never bruise my soul,  I just couldn't bare it again. With her I don't know how to be anything less than the most passionate man in her life. I'm that blink of an eye in slow motion that makes her sleep feel lonely without my existence. I'm in this woman's shadow always wanting to be found but lost in darkness. In the blinding night I carve her face in my pillow then taking my hands and finding solace with them. why am I so lonely?

20061219165010AAX4tGC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would a guy say one thing with words but his actions say another thing?	I offered to pay a guy on my ballroom team to give me lessons once a week. He said he would love to but he didn't want any money for it. He gave me two lessons. Then on the third week he said that he didn't know when he was going to have time because he was so busy. He told me to call him everyday to check. We set a time but he had to cancel.  We didn't have a lesson that week or the next week.   I asked him if he still wanted to give me lessons and he said yes he did but I would have to work with him and his schedule to work it out. Now we are on the third week of him saying he is too busy and having me call him to check his schedule everyday. I have given him the option of saying that he can't do it anymore but he keeps saying that he does. Should I believe him and keep checking with him every week? Or would you say that his actions speak louder than his words and I should just tell him to forget it? Why would he keep telling me he wants to do it if he doesn't?

I try to talk to him but it never gets to anything.    Sometimes i get so sad because I feel that I just dont fit it.

What else is there to do?

20061221061241AAJnXNt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys, do you think it helps to be a jerk to your girl sometimes?	I know everyone will answer "of course not" and give all the warm, fuzzy stereotypical answers, but I kind of think that it does. It's almost like on some deep psychological level women need that. Kind of how women stay in toxic relationships or stay with men who cheat and so on and so forth. I know no one will admit to this because it's not PC but I really think it's true. I'm not talking about being abusive or anything like that, just intentionally being a smart allec and things like that. I think conflict almost triggers some kind of animal attraction in women. If you are kind and loving all the time and treat her like a queen she will get bored and leave eventually. So I think you have to just be a jerk sometimes to spice it up and keep her satisfied. Give her something to complain about to her friends lol. No one will admit it but really think about it, I think on some level it's true to a certain extent. Begin the flames!

20070129075626AAj6Nq0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do to leave this controlling relationship?	My boyfriend is making me ill. I ended the relationship due to his binge drinking and putting me in danger due to this. The problem is that he calls me 30 times per day at work, on my  mobile so on. He tries blaming me for all his problems by wearing me down saying I have done wrong by not helping, supporting him enough, so on. Then it goes to he loves me and he is sorry, then he calls me to pick on my voice tone and say I am being funny with him because I do not sound happy to hear from him and I am "punishing" him enoough and I am making him ill. I left him due to him drinking at the weekends and being aggresive to me, lying about alcohol consumption and being really controlling, not allowing me male friends, to go out with my friends, wear certain clothes, so on. He says to think of the ggod times we had, which we did sometimes, and to realise im his best friend. But how do you treat your best friend like this? Anybody else out there had this problem and  how did it work out for you

Just thought i would post this so that i could get some advice, outside from my close friends.      Ive been friends with this girl since or last year in highschool and now we are both starting at a new college together. We share some of the same interests and can have a really good time together(from what i can tell). My problem is that, i feel like when its just me and her together; that shes more into me, and a closer friend. But when we get with our group of friends, she seems to not be as interested in me, and what im saying.  We joke about the person we wanna marry and try to find each other boyfriend and girlfriends for ourselfs from random people we see. In a joking manner, and what not.       Maybe i can just ask you guys, what you think my next step would be. I know i should be honest with her, and just tell her im interested, but damn. i dont wanna make our friendship awkward, especially if we are just starting into a new college together.

I've left part of my previous msg below to refresh your memory. I simply cannot choose a "best answer" as I find that each and every one of you have helped me in all you had said.

20070128050304AAKFTWA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need opinions please, guys preferably, but girls you can too. Thanks!?	My boyfriend got in some trouble a few weeks ago and so now he is in a youth development center for a possible 6-15 months pending behavior. We have been together for almost a year. This is our first valentine's day and i wanted to do something special. Like send him a nice card, the lyrics to that Martina McBride song "my valentine", and write him a poem. The poem I wrote is this:      All Iever wanted was to be part of your heart,And for us to be together, to never be apart.No one else in the world can even compare,You're perfect and so is this love that we share.   We have so much more than I ever thought we would,I love you more than I ever thought I could.I promise to give you all I have to give,I'll do anything for you as long as I live.In your eyes I see our present, our future and past,      By the way you look at me I know we will last.I hope that one day you'll come to realize,How perfect you are when seen thru my eyes.      (see details for rest, ran out of room)

20070313112759AApG35z	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Macht die Trennung einer Beziehung von der Handlung her sinn? (siehe Details)?	Als Ausnahme lasse ich eine Beziehung gelten, in der wirklich alles ausdiskutiert wird und man sich dann am Ende auch zusammensetzt und gemeinsam beschlie?t sich zu trennen.      Ist es in jedem anderen Fall nicht so, dass ein Partner nicht gesagt hat was ihn st?rt, bzw nichts daran ge?ndert hat und aus bequemlichkeit lieber schluss macht? W?re ein Verhalten, bei dem sich das Paar langsam auseinanderlebt nicht viel logischer? Man unternimmt nicht mehr so viel miteinander, man redet weniger, man sieht andere Leute und schwups zieht man aus bzw sieht sich nicht mehr ohne diese entgültigen und machthaberischen Worte: Ich m?chte keine Beziehung mehr, es ist besser wenn wir uns trennen (von der Aussage her).
20070402081805AAUAsmc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Wieviel Zeit sollte man miteinander verbracht haben um sich rational über eine Beziehung unterhalten zu k?nnen	Wenn die Begebenheiten so sind, dass emotional keine Beziehung zustande kommt, weil die Zeit begrenzt ist, oder zumindest begrenzt scheint (zB bei einem Urlaubsflirt o.?.). Wieviel Zeit sollte man dann miteinander verbracht haben um zu wissen und sagen zu k?nnen dass man mehr m?chte.   Und was muss geschehen sein? Muss man sich geküsst haben, oder im Arm gelegen haben?      Meine überlegung ist, dass wenn man zu früh fragt sich eventuell die M?glichkeit nicht mehr ergibt sich wieder zusehen. Wenn man nicht darüber spricht kann man sich nochmal unverbindlich treffen und dann kann sich immer noch mehr daraus entwickeln.

So there's girl in one of my classes who sits only a couple seats away, and I don't like her at all and she's like a near-friendless loser.

20070412082432AAqhD8r	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When  a guy is into...Pornography????	He looks at porno sites almost daily. He has a web cam and joined an xxx site where he can view women who also have web cams and use them to display themselves nude and performing all kinds of sexual acts. Besides just watching, his profile states he is also interested in face-to-face encounters.    He claims to be a Christian and thinks sex outside marriage is a sin. He says he likes this certain nice girl a lot but seems somewhat detached. Is it possible he is numb and has no strong emotions or feelings?

20070506010556AAHaHWK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I tell her?	a friend of mine recently told me about her current situation she has with this guy she is talking to. she told me he said, "what do you want?" (refering to their 'relationship'). she is a VERY shy person and after a long time of procrastinating she told him, "why can't you understand that I can't say it?" He told her; "you're like how old? 19, 20? Just grow up." She told me that she finally told him she liked him and wanted more than friends. His response to her was, "well, I can't say more than friends right now, we can't just become boyfriend and girlfirned just like that. thats not how it works." He didn't really say if he liked her or not. She told me though that when she asked him if he liked her, he told her "I think you are a very attractive girl." He then told her that while he was talking to her, he was also talking to 2 other girls. One for a year now, and the other a couple months b4 my friend. What advice should I give her. I don't want her to get hurt from this guy.

Es la típica ni?a mona, y yo, medio pringao, asi que no sé como es que me habla. En fin, yo tenía un amigo, que me caia muy bien y que lso 3 nos ibamos a casa después del instituto. Pero, cuando el se iba, ella me decía "?Te cae bien este? No sé, es un poco raro, ami no me cae muy bien" Y desde aquel día, casi pro seguirle la corriente, empecé a ignorar un poco a mi amigo. Supongo que esa chica era demasiado valiosa (ojo, no me gusta, en serio, tengo otros gustos) vaiosa e importante, y querái que siguiera a mi lado. Pero, un día, estaba en el ba?o, y un amigo entró a espiarme. Le contó rápidamente una broma a un amigo mio, criticándome sobre ahi abajo. Yo me irrité, insulté, y apunto de partirle la cara. Reventé en lágrimas. Yo este asunto, entre llanto y llanto, se lo conté a mi amiga, porque ese asunto ERA CIERTO y no estaba orgulloso. No era algo muy agradable de que hablar y...

20070326211117AAom1Ie	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a sly, slightly conniving plan: Could it work?	I've been missing a girl for 11 months. I liked her, then fell in love with her, but she never liked me back. She got mad at me for a mistake I made which takes too much explanation and two months later she told me she didn't want to talk to me anymore. I HAD NOT been talking to her since she said she didn't want to talk to me anymore. So I gave her what she wanted. We used to say hi occasionally after that when we went back to school. I thought things would be cool between us so recently for the 1st time I tried to talk to her. When I asked her how she was, she kept her back turned towards me, unlike when I saw her sneak so many glances at me this past year. She texted on her phone. She never even looked at me, never said a word. I told her I only wanted us to be friends again but she wasn't hearing me. She talked to everyone who came in the hall but me. I just said "ok, I get the point, you don't have to say anything else. I guess I'll just see you around." I left the hall.

Was I right to stand up for myself in this way ?
20070326214620AAPxGIM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he doing this?	He has a heart of gold and would give you the shirt off his back. That is how people describe him. He's been hurt in past relationships and wants to develope a friendship before a relationship. We've been "growing" a friendship over the past 3 months, He makes all the advances - I respond to show him I am interested, too. Things were going very well between us. Then all of a sudden he completely backed off and has been doing things that are uncharacteristic of him. The last time I spoke with him he said that he's just been "really busy" - that's all it was. I've been giving him space because I think he is afraid of the feelings he's been having and will be back when he resolves these issues. I haven't been calling him because I don't want to appear needy or be a pest. Would you wait for him to come around, confront him about his behavior or ask him out? Walking away isn't an option.

He told me about her and how he didn't like her because she was obsessed with him.   -- He either smiles or says hi whenever he sees me and I look back.   -- In class, he'll turn around and look at me sometimes, but I'll pretend I don't see him because I don't know what to say or do.   -- People told me earlier that it looks like he likes me because he apparently acts differently towards me, especially when I'm sad (he seems to be concerned and is determined to make me feel better).   -- We argue but aren't serious and if we are, one of us is always sorry.   -- I see him stare at me sometimes.   -- The other day, I was hanging out with older kids because I wasn't comfortable around certain people of my age. He sat right next to me and when some left, he moved his seat back & I wasn't sure if it was because my peers were around and the older kids left.

This girl and I were best friends, but I stopped talking to her because I felt that she was untrust worthy(talking to people that she and I would talk about), talking and keeping her myspace page with guys(while her man was locked up and when he wasn't). All this taken into consideration, I just felt it was a matter of time before she started talking to me. I just stopped talking to her cold turkey. Now we're at least talking and I've tried explaining to her that I think she was wrong to be a backstabber and triflin the way she was. She is telling me that it hurts her that I didnt know her well enough to know that she would do that everyone else except for me because she cherished our friendship. But how am I supposed to know that? She is like "I use them, but I don't care about them. You were my best friend, I care about you. I would have never betrayed you." Ummm, what am I supposed to believe?

Sorry, one important thing I left out when I posted this before, and may effect the answers given... these people are Jehovah's Witnesses...   If you suspected your husband of cheating, and are highly religious, and finally pressured him to admit he had an affair and he did a few days ago (what would you do)... he tells you about three women going back several years, the third he is still seeing for over a year. You both have one child together and have been married 16 years. Neither one of you have been getting along for a long time, and seem to not have much in common. The wife still loves the husband.... would you stay, what do you think most people would do? (a good friend of mine is dealig with this, and I don't know what to tell her...)

20060831194459AAupQpi	Family & Relationships;Friends	Its been 2 years since I have had a friend apart from my sister in law or hubby. I'm a stay at home mom of a 1	Its been 2 years since I have had a friend apart from my sister in law or hubby. I'm a stay at home mom of a 17 month old and I am pretty busy but I would like to make some friends who have kids my sons age. I'm really shy and I'm nervous about going out to meet new people because its been so long. My husband tries to get me to be friends with his friends wives but none of them have kids and they still drink and stuff. I'm scared to meet new people because I don't know what I would talk about apart from my son. I don't go out all that much. I'd really like to go out sometimes and do stuff with a friend my own age who has kids. Any suggestions?

20090205122028AAmP34t	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Hum, I'm really sad and I need some advice. And possibly to hear some insight from a real man?	Okay, I have been in love with the same guy for half of my life. He is my rock, my everything, I can't imagine living without him. Anytime he needs anything I bend over backwards to help him, and infront of his friends her treats me like a trophy girl, but about two years ago, he started being very mean to be. He went from being the shy, modest, caring guy I fell in love with, to a mean, "ghetto" underground rapper that mentally and verbally abuses me. He calls me stupid and infront of a group of about thirty people he pointed in my face and told me "You don't speak", later telling me that I can't talk unless he allows me to. I was so embarrased, and I am an outspoken free-minded woman, so I told him how I felt about it. He called me a ***** and walked away. I am 4' 10" and he is about 6' 4", and lately I have been feeling scared physically, not sexually, as we have never had sex, but afraid he would get mad and hit me. We hadn't really talked about anything of substance for awhile and the other day I tried to show him a video, maybe to get in a few good laughs. He told me I was stupid and why do I even bother talking. He calls me and other women "bitches" and "hot (whatevers)". He knows that i love him, and it physically hurts when I am not around him, it is my worse nightmare, to the point where I can have panic attacks. He knows that he has a good, hard-working woman at his side, then he acts all lonely and tells his friends no one loves him and that he is "all alone" and will he ever find someone who cares and what to be with him. He plays these mind games and I just don't know what to do anymore. Why would he ask for everything he could already have and then throw me and our almost decade long relationship out the window? What should I do?
20090205141729AAccxS9	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Asking for gift cards vs registering for gifts?	I posted a forum a short time ago about me and my fiance and our wedding.  We're being financially responsible and are having a big family cookout after the wedding at our house so the families could meet and enjoy the afternoon.  Our families are gonna help us out by bringing the food but as far as the other guests my girl wants to suggest they just give us gift cards or even cash.      My question in the other post was "is that tacky to ask for gift cards or cash?"  One girl said it was very tacky to ask for gift cards but what we could do is register somewhere and let people pick what they want to give us.      My thing is this.  If you say it's tacky to ask for a specific gift how is it not tacky to pick out a bunch of gifts then tell people to pick something?        What do you think?

20060807132936AABSBYv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I try a long distance relationship? How?	I recently went to the beach. On our third day there I met a young man in a Christian bookstore. Something compelled me to give him my PN, which I usually never do (I'm the shy kind of girl). The next night we hung out on the beach. The day after he and his family took me out to dinner. Needless to say, he kissed me and it was wonderful. Long story short, we've called each other every day since then (which was barely a week ago). I feel like I've known him forever, but I have a very difficult year of school ahead of me and I don't know what to do. Should I keep it as friends or try for something more? He lives in Illinois and I live in NC and he's 2 years older than I am. Is it worth it?

I go to a private school at the moment, and my parents are to change me to a really good goverment school that takes the goverment curriculem. Now this school takes a certain language as 2 subjects but the science and math etc. are in English. Now ofcourse im going to spend most of the time trying my best to study this language, but the princpal said if i do, Im going to start failing other subjects due to failure of projects, homework, etc. ... This school also pays me everymonth to go there(I mean omg!) but what im concerned about is that theres a rule in this school. Say Im in grade 11 and I fail one subject at the examinations, Im not allowed back into the school AND if i want to go back to any school private/goverment, I have to learn that particular language and theres no choice. Im feeling really bad about the decision because my parents are having financial problems and if I decide to go back to my private school, Im scared that my parents get broke.

She seems pretty cool.  I chatted with her for a few minutes one day in the break room.  When she got up to put her purse in her locker, she had her back to me and my friend, but I was at an angle to where I could see she had a big smile on her face.  I didn't really say anything funny, so it had to be something else.  Of course it was something else.  Why the hell am I asking about this on the internet?  She obviously wants me!

I was at the convenient store last night with my girlfriend's sister picking up a few things, then all of a sudden an old friend of mine came up to my car, stumbling drunk. she was going on and on about how wasted she is and how many more beers she had to drink before arriving at her boyfriend's house a few miles down the road. all she kept saying was "what time is it? it's time to get ill!" making an absolute fool of herself. she then went on about random stupid things. my girlfriend's sister got out of the car, to just catch up with old times, by her car, then came back into mine shortly. we said bye and took off, then my girl's sis called the police saying there's a girl driving drunk around this part of town. i talked to a friend of mine at work the next day who is also friends with her and told me i was "f'ed up" for doing that. he doesn't understand that a close friend of mine died drunk driving about 2 months ago. am i or is she an "ahole" for doing that?

After a night of drinking I had my friend (a girl n 27) stay at my place cause she was in no shape to drive.we're mature adults so we shared my bed.i also gave her some comfy clothes to wear n she changed into them in my bathroom.she isnt one to wear panties to bed so she left those off.in the morning she went to the bathroom again to get back into her clothes but she kept my shirt on n just put her jeans on with no panties.she giggled and told me me she was leaving her panties on my floor.she also joked i could frame them n put them on my wall or something.i found that strange since we were going to her place anyway n she could have taken them with her.a few days later we hung out.she was getting ready for the bar n so she came walking into the living room with just jeans on n a bra claiming she was looking for a shirt.she told me not to look n she covered her boobs.i told her ive seen boobs before n she joked again - so r u still sniffing those panties at your place? whats her deal?
20060911223230AASQN8O	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	There is this one girl...?	There is this girl at my church and I really like her. But i am to afraid to tell her what do I do. I am homeschooled so that doesn't help, cause with homeschooling we aren't social people and I don't know if she has a boyfriend already. I am shy about talking to girls about this stuff. I am 13yrs old. Don't freak out I'm to young please. But see I have 2 younger brothers and I'm just feeling neglected. I know I could make friends with a boy. (Not gay understand!!!) But they are of course like me not comferting to the same sex. Another problem is I can't have a girlfriend till I'm 16. My brothers will rat out on me. But should I make friends with her? As we get older we start to make it work out? See in my mind she is the hottest girl ever (I know don't tell her that...) like the way I would describe my ultimate girllfriend (but that changes as we get older...) so even making friends would be hard for me. I would be so nervous. I like her for her personality too. Just not for her looks

20060914062155AA1eJeW	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My cat is scared of my boyfriend...?	I am in love with an angry man & he throws fits over just about anything which is very immature for a 25 year old. I realize this & I have accepted this & yes I do know he most likely will not change or grow out of this childish pattern.      Something scared me yesterday. I haven't noticed this before, when we came home and settled in the cat was meowing.  Although she already ate a few hours earlier, I told him to give her a treat or two. She came kind of close to him and when he moved she ran toward me. I grabbed her and told him "shes scared of you". He got very offended by it.       I wake up right when my bf leaves for work. This morning I decided to pretend I was asleep just cuz I guess.The cat didn't know I was awake either. He called her in to feed her, which I do not him & she didn't move. He came to hug me goodbye while I was sleeping, then started calling the cat. She ran away from him.      When he left the door she made noises then proceeded to wake me up. She ran to her food.
20060917022325AAHcBB9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm bi-sexual, and my girlfriend and I's relationship is dwindling!?	Okay. I met this wonderful girl a few days after I dumped my last boyfriend. Yet again, it was love at first sight. We talked, and eventually we started dating. We see each other everyday, and talk all the time. But yet, she acts like she's bored with me, and I'm scared that I'll lose her. She says I'm the best thing that's ever happened to her, and I believe her, because she pulled me out of a deep depression. When we're together she kinda drifts off, and doesnt really walk near me. She's also bisexual, and says other guys are hot, as well as women. This urks me, to the point where, I'm about to lose it. I love her to death, and losing her would be like losing a part of myself. Please! If anyone can help, I'ld love hear advice. Thanks.

I know it's not any of my business but I could see that something had been bothering him and it still does today and rightfully so.

I've never been a girly - girl and I think I'm quit strong looking and I do lots of sports and action things like climbing.   Yet people talk to me really carefully & smile like I'm a little baby.   They say things like 'aww boo your so cute' even though I'm there age!      It's soooooo annoying & I hate it.   Even the teachers do it!!! They smile at me & if anybody knocks into   me or something there like 'oh be careful' and then ask if i'm okay, and do that weird smile like I'm a Fragile varse or something.      The other day in Netball practise, my coach said 'boo, it's like your doing a dance not playing netball, stop floating and dancing about' and then she said when we were all gathered round 'aww, isn't booey like a little Porcelain doll'      I hate it soo much becuase it's like I get treated differently! And it's like everybodys careful around me and careful what they say! I don't know what to do to stop them from thinking this!      How do I stop them thinking I'm this little girl?      Thanks <3

20090205150509AAA3oRA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My boyfriend "hates giving oral" what should I do? MATURE ANSWERS PLEASE?	My boyfriend tells me he only does it because he cares about me but he rarely gives it. says that he cant get me off, so hes not putting in any effort. when I tell him what makes me feel good he just gets frusterated, but expects me to give it back to him, I do it because I like to. I didnt get it for weeks and when he did the other day it was less than a minute. I tell him I take it personally because he's taking something satisfying away from me.. I dont know what to do because when I ask for it or make suggestions he gets irritated. I see oral sex counts as sex and I cant get off unless I get it, doesnt make sex feel as good. It makes me upset that im not getting the sexual affection I want but i feel guilty asking/begging for it when he says he "hates" giving to oral in general. other than that hes very sweet, goes out of the way to make me happy. I dont want to settle without getting oral I just dont know how else to approach this with him. Hes had 2 girlfriends cheat on him in the past and I would never hurt him like that but I think I know why they did. what should I do, just go about and be happy with him even though im not sexually satisfied?
20090205115803AAQe3pt	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can someone please help me with this???????  I dont understand this guy one bit!!!?	back in nov this guy messaged me on myspace, and we talked here and there (i thought he was obnoxious, he was cocky, arrogant and im a ny giants fan and hes a dallas cowboys fan...arch rivials...so he was talking smack, which i found to be quite annoying and rude ) we talked for some time online and he wanted to meet me...i kept saying no, after a month of not taking no for an answer..... i finally caved. we met, and hit it off.   he seemed very much into me....calling me every chance he got and texting me as well. during xmas (2 wks after we met) in so many words wanted to be invited to our familyxmas party (i told him my whole fam would be there like 30ppl and he didnt care). we even spent newyears together... things went fine from there, hanging out anywhere from 1-3xs a week (hed make plans a lot with me, but id ask him out too and he never declined)...still calling me every day (sometimes several times a day) and texting me like crazy. when we together he is very big on PDA's always holding my hand, hugging me or kissing me here and there. seems very much into me. he keeps talkin about valentines day and how he has this special thing planned for me and whatnot.   ive talked to him about being exclusive and he keeps telling me hes not ready   but   also isnt seeing anyone else nor is he looking for anyone else   ive met a lot of his friends, met his family, etc. he even has a pic of us on his cell phone wallpaper   but yet, he doesnt want to be exclusive. idk   if we're watching tv, he insists on snuggling with me...always.   we've been together for almost 2 months now. he still calls me every day (i never call 1st, cos he always beats me to it) and is always texting me.   i feel like we are a couple just cos of the way were are and stuff.   one night out to dinner his friend called, and he said "i cant talk now ill call u back im out with my girl"   MY GIRL (makes u think he wants to be exclusive or considers me that way)   last night we were talking online and my guy friend (who now lives in florida) wants to move back to NJ but lost touch with a lot of ppl here except me, wants to try to get a place with me...i asked my "bf" how he felt about that...it didnt phase him the least bit, when i asked how come (cos i thought that was weird) hes like "A. we;re not official and B. i know u like me"   which opened a whole new can of worms, i was like well u do this and do that(meaning the way he is with me shows me different), whats the big deal about being exclusive....hes like im not ready...but theres no one else and im not looking for anyone else (well doesnt that mean if youre not looking for anyone else, u just want to be with that one person, hence "exclusive")   im like will u ever be ready (cos at this point im getting mad, cos either u wanna be with someone or u dont) and quite frankly i dont want to wait around forever. i hate games.   and hes like we'll see around valentine's day how the night goes, trust me, thats when i think we be official (pretty much the exact words he said).   im like what? if youre not ready now, what makes u think by then you will be. and hes just like idont know...trust me.   then later we talked again and he was like "i dont wanna hurt u or have me get hurt" im like why do u think im gonna hurt u, im not going to do that, not on my to do list (and hes like ive heard that before)....im guessing from his ex. idk. his ex who he was madly in love with broke his heart, leaving him for another guy.  (and he's told me he had a hard time getting over her and that, that is..............until he met me...he said, and i quote.....im the first person he's met since his ex, that has gotten his mind off of her and has made him happy)   so back on track here..... im like i have no intentions of hurting u.(the only time ive ever broken up with any guys is if they've done me wrong, and ive never cheated and dont plan on starting now)   then hes like i feel like we've rushed things   (im like well, you invited yourself over to meet my fam after 2 weeks during our xmas party, u the one that says u can see yourself falling in love with me in a few months...yes he said that to me like a month ago.......)   his reply "this is true, that still all can happen"  and he keeps saying "nothing's gonna change with us" (meaning for the worst....hes like im not leaving u, and dont plan on it)   so im confused. i keep getting mixed signals   he called me later that night (again) and was like he "misses the challenge of things" when we first met i wasnt very susceptible to things...and he liked that. now its been 2 months and im comfortable and i guess he misses the challenge.   but he keeps saying "no worries, im not going anywhere, i like spending time with you, youre great, im very into you" blah blah blah.   then brings up vday again. like we'll see then...trust me   idk   then after we hung up (i usually text right after and say "kisssss") i didnt do it that time....but 20secs after we hung up i get a text from him and hes l
20090205153008AAbnCs6	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Not sure what to do if anything? (sorry kinda long)?	The other day my husband for some reason told me that his family is f**ked up because both his brothers have tied to commit suicide, When I asked how could their lives be that bad that they would want to do that, I said is it because neither of them have girlfriends (his younger brother is obsessed with getting a gf) he said his older brother was years ago when he lived at a boys college and then he said his younger brother tried to kill himself twice...because of me!!!   WTF, he said that his mum told him a few months ago that his brother tried to kill himself because of me, but my hubby said I don't want to know, but know he has told me and I really want to know why. What could I have done that was so bad to make him want to do that twice or at all!! Before I was engaged I moved to the city and I needed someone to live with and my now brother in law also needed someone to live with so we decided to move in together while we were studying, I was already with my now husband at that stage, we had been going out for a few months. It was his first time living away from home but not mine, I was in the last year of my course, I knew that he struggled a little being away from home and trying to learn to live with a stranger,(cos we really didn't know each other that well yet) I tried really hard to help him, I'd help him cook, help with his homework and give him tips on getting work. He was not an easy person to live with when I got engaged to his brother I came home and he had already been told over the phone and instead of congratulating me he went on a rave about how his brother was selfeish and a lier and that he was a slut and that it want fair that we were getting married when he hadnt even had a girlfriend yet, he went on about how my hubby's ex gf was the nicest person he has ever met (even though I know she's not, cos she's a *****, my husband even told me later that his brother never liked her anyway) Everything was cool until I got engaged and then he would be so mean to me that he would make me cry and even when I was crying he would keep going at me. We ended up arguing a bit over silly things like that he would practice with his fire twirling sticks in the apartment (which was only tiny) right where I was trying to study when there was a park across the road, or he would go in my room and empty my clothes basket when he had his own that was already empty, and one night I came home to find his friends in my bed when only hours earlier I said that no-one was to sleep in my bed but me. One of his friend came over drunk one night and tried to get in my room to have sex with me insisting that my fiance wouldnt mind. I meen seriously the **** that I put up with when I lived there and the whole time I tried to be friends with him and now 3 years later my mother in law comes out with something like that!! I tried to ask for her help when it was all happening but she would just say 'oh he's just a boy' and stuff like that as if I was making a deal over nothing.   Now I dont know what to do because I think that his whole family hate me and I would never wish for his brother to do something so silly, I want to know what I did or said that was so bad, should I try to talk to my brother in law or talk to my mother in law or what? My husband doesnt want to talk about it cos he said he doesnt know why it happened he was jsut told that a few months ago. im upset and pissed off that she would even say this to my hubby, she is one for exagerating and he knows that but he said he doesnt think she would exagerate something like that, I cant even go to their house anymore if this is what they think of me now. What shouold I do?

My family makes me angry      Like today my sister fed my dogs her dog food.  I feed a natural food and mixing it with her cheap food causes them to get really sick.  I told her no and my parents yelled at me.      My parents dont even listen to me.  Theyre rarely home.  I even have to scream to get food.  Cows milk makes me sick and I told my dad but he insisted on buying it today...but cereal is the only food i have to eat (seriously it is...im not vegan or anything but cows milk makes my stomach hurt really bad)      I just need to learn to chill out but I cant help it.  Im happy when my parents are gone but when theyre here I get so pissed and I hate myself all the time.

20090205151918AAHkg8K	Family & Relationships;Family	My brothers are mean?	Ever since I was little I have had a huge problem with my brothers.  Its not your average brother sister rivalry, its a whole lot worse.  We have never gotten along.  I think the main reason I resent them so much is because they are and were always putting me down and always blaming me for the bad things they did.  They also never get in trouble with my parents, my parents never notice their bad behavior, it seems like they only notice mine, and trust me, they behave a lot worse than me.  It really hurts, because they are always against me, and sometimes it seems like my parents are on their side.  I'm sick of them treating me poorly, and I'm sick of my parents thinking they are angels.  I really need advice on what to do, because I am sick and tired of dealing with them.

20060924180823AAqVGKm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me?	There's this guy on my swim team who's two years older than me. I'm a freshman and he's a junior. He's offered me rides many times and stayed with me while I was waiting for my ride once although my coach was still there waiting with me also. Once at a swim meet, he kept bringing up guys who are on the team and asking if I liked any one of them. He gives me compliments about things and when this other girl on my swim team asked him to go with her to homecoming as friends he said yes. When she was telling me about it. He came up and jokingly asked me if I was jealous. I think it's over a 6 month period that he did all this. At homecoming he complimented me on how I looked and asked if I came with a date. He asked me about the guys I danced with and why I danced with those guys. I like him although I don't show it at all and I know he's nice to everyone.  At homecoming I had to ask him to dance and then he left his date to slow dance with me. He didn't ask me. Sorry if he answer already.

20090205144253AAk9uZx	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Will he ever propose?	I have been with my partner for 5 years. I have know him for 9 years. We have 2 little boys together. We own a house. He works in a great job and I am working part time and studying at the same time. I only have one more course to go and graudate with my bachelor in June. When I was pregnant with our first son he proposed to me but he didnt mean it and only did it because of the pressure so I told him that I didnt want to be engaged and that he should do it when he is ready. That was 2 and a half years ago. Therefore we even have the engagement ring. What I want to know is why he wont propose to me. Getting married is really important to me. I know the quote 'why buy the cow when the milk is free' but I mean come on, if I am good enough to be his kids mum shouldnt I be good enough to be his wife. He keeps making excuses as to why he doesnt want to get married. Do you think I should wait or do you think he will never ask because there is no motivation. I dont want anyone making mean comments suggesting that I should of gotten married before I had my kids etc. I would never trade my kids for the world and marriage wasnt important back then. I just think that now we are in a good situation we could married and he doesnt seem to want to.
20090205144520AAi87Wi	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I Stay With My Fiance?	I am a pretty 24 woman who is engaged to a 36 year old man. We have been together for 5 years and engaged for 2 of those. He has 2 kids from a previous marriage. They are 13 & 15 and his son is always acting up and being disrespectful when he is with us during the summer. My fiance cheated on me the first 6 months we were together. From that affair, his 3rd child was born and she is now almost 4 years old. He has only seen her about 3 or 4 times in her life and we've been living in a different state for about 3 years now. He basically pays child support for 3 kids. I know that at anytime he can go to court for backpay because he now makes very good income and has never reported that for 3 years to the attorney general. In fact the ex he cheated on me with is taking him back to court this month. I feel like there is always drama in my life. He does treat me wonderful now because he said he'll spend the rest of his life making it up to me. But the older I get, the more I realize I'm wasting my life away with a man who has way too many responsibilities for me to deal with. I'm even afraid to marry him because I don't want his exes getting their hands on my money. I make a very good living for myself and don't need a man to support me or take care of me. I feel like a huge weight would be lifted off of my shoulders if I left him. So why can't I leave? I guess I've been smart enough to not have kids with him or invest money, but that's no way to live. I need to break free and I need a little push definitely.
20090205145308AASUrmF	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wearing white on your wedding day?	Ok, so I've been married before. Never had a wedding though so I am getting married in June and I have searched everywhere for a dress. The color that I picked was called pool since it is on the beach. I cannot find a dress color besides white that looks good with that color. I know people get married all the time in white that have been married before but I just wanted some opinions. I am having a simple beach wedding with family and close friends. I'm not a traditional person and my fiance definitely is not. Would it be awful for me to wear white. After all is it "our" day so maybe we should wear what we want? White is supposed to be a virginal thing anyway and I know 90% of people who get married are not virgins! I'm stuck and I have to buy a dress by sunday.

20090205151410AAVP5WB	Family & Relationships;Family	Why are they blaming me for giving birth early?	I'm a surrogate for my brother and his wife so they can have a second child. I was looking after their daughter at their home when I slipped walking down their stairs and I landed on my stomach. I slipped on one of my sister in law's skates as in roller skates. I'm getting blamed by her for not being careful as the baby might die but I hadn't noticed it on my way down the stairs, I noticed it going up. Am I really to blame?    I was almost 7 months pregnant. I feel awful about what's happened with out being blamed for it.
20090205152123AAytK5V	Family & Relationships;Family	Why the hell should I ******* bother with stupid-*** school any ******* more?!?!?!?!?!?	No lectures please, just bear with me for a second.      Okay, so I started off decent but it's getting kind of hard. I'm in 6th grade. First year of middle school. Now I don't even think I should bother with it anymore. My parents don't care and I honestly think the only reason my mom gets me up in the morning is so she doesn't go to jail. (my sisters got in trouble with truancy and if I do anymore my mom could go to jail). Why should I even bother? My parents pay no attention to my schooling, and all my friends don't give a ****. (Excuse my french). Anyways, what's the point? Like, right now I couldn't care less if I make it to college or not.        I know I'm smart because I always understand EVERYTHING taht happens if somebody shows me a second time real quick, but I just DON'T have the feeling that I NEED to go or do my work. My teachers have ALWAYS loved me more then everybody else, and they have ALL thought that I show more potential then most students.       My basic question is this;    Why should I btoher anymore? I get no praise or reward or ANTYING.     Give me ONE good reason that would convince me to keep my gardes up even when I ahte school.

20090205152022AAtYXvd	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My fiance is insecure about his body...what do I do?	I have no idea what to do in this situation and I need some help.   I think my fiance is a beautiful creature. He has an awesome body complete with bodybuilder frame (he can bench 400 on a bad day - no juice) and seriously ice blue eyes. He's Italian and Irish and I am completely head over heels in love with him. When he walks into the room it lights up and my heart skips a beat. We have one of those loves that is eternal and has been through the ringer and still survives.    The concern that I have is his insecurity in himself. He is always looking in the mirror at himself when he gets dressed or undressed and always says, "Babe, I'm getting fat." He has put on some weight since we met 18 months ago, but life can do that. He also hasn't been going to the gym as much as he'd like.    I tell him all the time how great I think he looks and how incredibly attracted to him I am, but he just smiles at me and says, "Yeah, ok."    It's started to interfere with our sex life - from once a day/every other day to once a month. When we are intimate, he is upset that he can't last very long (though I am still satisfied with him).    I tell him it doesn't matter. I enjoy it regardless. He's mentioned getting some of those pills you see advertised on tv for enhancement and performance. I'm against them. I don't want them to ruin his body and do something irreversible.    Any suggestions??

20090205153052AA6dptm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I being a B*tch if Im not happy about my husbands' kids with his ex-wife coming to Our daughter's?	First birthday party? I usually have no problem inviting his other kids over. Holiday's (Christmas, Thanksgiving, even holloween) I am sure to ask and invite thm over. However, for the last year, their mother (hubby's ex) has not let them come visit their baby sister NOT Once. She always makes excuses for why they can't come and I don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that she was just bing typical about the whole re-marraige situation and wanted to keep the kids away from the new wife (i get that, ok) so anyhow, I decided that was just fine with me and that I'd be fortunate not to have to deal with baby-mamma drama anyhow.  So, of course hubby still has to pay child support(his kids ages are 6 and 4) so he still has to deal with her on some level but I think that when It concerns MY child age 1 that he should consult Me. Not her. I believe that he should have asked me if they could come to our daughters party before he called her to invite them. Am I wrong? She never otherwise (holidays or nothing) willl allow them to visit. Now that it is my daughter's day, and I feel like they are intruding on her day with her dad since she never otherwise lets them visit. Am I being selfish? your thoughts please before hubby comes home and I confront him. I want your opinions, am i handling this in a bad way?
20090205153338AAahcN4	Family & Relationships;Family	Can a parent disown their child (a 22 year old)?	im asking this out of a desperate 16 year old sister's point of view. my brother is crazy (i honestly think he's legally insane) but my parents are too nice to throw him out or even "put him away" . he is sane enough, though in law's eyes so instead of a crazy house he'd be sent to jail. he's a VERY religious man with a personality that does not go to well with our society today. anyways, can a parent disown their child if they're 22 and refusing to get a job/education? what he's doing is effecting the entire family, not just him. if my parents ever realize how damaging he is to them and me, hopefully we can remove him from the name so anything he does will have no effect on the rest of our lives. please don't say im a heartless ***** for saying these things, i have been through way too much to care about my brother anymore.

My fiancee and his ex have an 11 year old daughter together. After they had her, his ex's mom and his uncle got married.(kinda wierd i know). the daughter lives with the ex and the uncle and ex's mom.well my fiancee and I have a 6 month old daughter together and plan to get married next year. i don't want my daughter going to the ex's house because they all do drugs in the house and during family events.(the ex smokes crack and is an alcoholic).  although i want my daughter to be involved with her sister, i don't nor do i want my daughter going to my fiance's ex's house.is this wrong of me and is it wrong of me to keep my daughter away from family events?. My fiance's ex also flirts with him still and is disrespectful to me. I dont do drugs and neither does my fiance and i fully welcome the 11 year old into my home and think she could come to our house to visit with my daughter...
20090205115545AA3JG8t	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can anyone please give me some advice?	ok i got some feed back off my last question but its like my question was not answered. its not that i wnt to be with my daughters father its just that i am still hurt.

20090205123228AA9sdHE	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Fiance seems to be freaked out by wedding plans...?	A little background; he's 29, I'm 25, and we've been together for 2 years, lived together for one. We've been engaged for about 2 months - a little over a month ago, HE proposed a date - June 13th (special day for us).       So, I assumed that's when he wants to get married, right?      Neither of us wanted to have a big wedding - only about 30 people, and very calm, low key, and relaxed, also, very low budget ($1,500).       We went today to look at a venue, and afterward, he was acting very strange. I think it's finally dawned on him that if we're going to have any sort of wedding, there is going to be a planning process. I think the whole idea of planning ANYTHING freaks him out, and he'd rather just go to the Justice of the Peace.       We had thought about eloping, but I really want my dad to be there - that's it. But if dad is there, then his mom and dad will want to be there, immediate family, friends, etc., and then the whole thing snowballs. I just am NOT happy with the idea of not even being able to have my father be there when I get married. I had mentioned doing something very simple in the park with only about 10 people - even THAT was too much...he just seems to be pro-marriage, but completely anti-any sort of wedding anything.       I don't know what to do with this. Of course, I'm going to talk to him tonight when we get home, but I'd like some ideas about what to say/why he might be feeling this way.       It's as though he wants to get married (I've asked him this, he 100% does), but is horrified by the idea of any sort of a wedding that has to be planned.

20090205121455AA0BoXC	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Girlfriend moving away.?	Hi, my girlfriend is moving away in about a month to about 60-80 miles away, and i am really not willing for a long distance relationship. this is because i am so insecure, and we argue a lot whilst texting as we take things the wrong way. however obviously both of us are upset by this. she is moving as she has found her dream job, and i have to stay put as i am in education. i am in year 12 and she is in the same year. however i keep getting these day dreams (kind of) of her doing other things to other men, and its really not nice. it makes me feel really jelous and makes me feel sick. how can i get rid of these feelings? i have tried doing everything?  but also she is having sex with me less, i think this maybe because she has just started a new job for a month, and is getting very tired, but this is really confusing, i have tried talking to her, but it hasnt helped. im really stuck, as its preventing me from doing my school work. please help me? thanks in advance, if you need anymore info then just ask :)

However prior to hanging up he tried to make it look like i was at fault and said that "he was erasing my number etc." I was like you said you said that u were gonna do that last time but ended up calling me. He was like well this time I am sure. Have a good life.      Then he was like.. i won't erase your number ill just wait for you to cave in and be the first one to call me, and i was like ok.. but i am seriously not ever calling you.      So a month passes of no calling and texting and i get a text from him saying that he wanted to apologize for what he did. I then ask him what's the purpose of his text and he says "to get your forgiviness"      Now, my ex is the type who LOVES to win and i told him i was highly doubtful that he called me to just apologize. I truly believe in my heart that he is doing this so we will start back conversing with each other casually. what's your oppinion?      Btw i am 21 and my ex is 20

20090205122855AA7ZEzc	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should I feel bad when...?	Okay so I have a lung infection/bronchitis asthma, I am 15 years old and I cannot get a job at my age. My father is going through some financial problems and does not have to much money at the time. He always has to buy my medicine and I feel bad for him when he does and then he doesn't have much money at all left.   Should I feel bad for him not having much money?      I mean sometimes I just feel like if I weren't here then everything would be okay, and that he is going through financial problems because of me.

Or is it the purest form of relationship, where both partners clearly define what they want from it? Further, do you think people can learn to love someone?
20090205124500AAa1ztZ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Does my sister need a maid of honor?	My sister is getting married for the second time, however this is her first formal wedding (her last marriage was a private civil ceremony). She has two daughters (age 12 and 14) and would like them both to be her bridesmaids. Does she also need a maid of honor? It seems odd to designate one of the daughters as her maid of honor.       With respect to MOH duties, my other two sisters and I will be putting on the shower, hosting the reception (at my home) and taking care of other duties. So, the MOH duties will be covered by me and my other two sisters. Does this seem okay for a second marriage? (My sister never had a shower or wedding reception for her first marriage.) Although I know that friends are usually in charge of showers and other MOH duties, my sister doesn't have any friends who can afford to take care of these things for her, and her sisters are delighted to do so (and will, of course, involve her friends as much as possible).      Thank you for your input.
20090205124517AAFg8t2	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do you think he's really a good guy and should I forgive him?	I think I may be in love with my male friend. He has claimed to be "in love" with both me and my best friend at different times. I don't think he's trying to split us up because I know he feels bad about it and tries to keep from causing conflict between the two of us. Now my best friend won't speak to him, they're in a huge fight, and he's running to me. I really don't want to deal with him, though, because I feel like no matter what nice things I do or what horrible things she does, he'll always put me as a distant second to her and treat me as such. For example, we weren't speaking for a few months, but now he realizes she's no longer interested in him, he's talking to me again. I don't really think it's right, but am I just being stupid or selfish? Please help! Easy 10 points!
