AbCeEZIhaa	They speak of that with people who contracted AIDS early in the disease. The social death came well before the physical one and was much worse. I do think it is very true and very painful for people to go through. We are social animals.|`|ul1P1qAQaa	It's sort of a silly comparison, since who knows right?    I would say that it is comparable to death. At least death of the self, the person. If you ask someone, what is it that makes us human, they will talk about free will, the soul, the ability to communicate; all of these things are closely connected to social interaction.    If you've ever studied linguistics, humans have some very interesting patterns in the development of self. No matter what language you speak we consistently recognize and communicate objects first. For a kid to get to the point where it can say "ball" is a miraculous thing. That child does not just recognize the existence of the ball, it also needs to recognize that we can represent and express the idea of the ball via specific sounds. It recognizes that we have a system of communication and it recognizes the rules... it realizes that that is a ball and not a wall or a dog, and that that is important.    We start to then store a copy of all of these things in our heads... everything that we "know" is really just a matter of what objects we've conceptualized and stored in our brains... from there we make associations between them, and subsequently allows us to try things based on cause and effect. So how we view everything is based on what we observe, and how we conclude these things are connected... now if you consider "personality", which is WHO you are... that is a much more specific idea that WHAT am I, which requires other WHOs  in order to compare and understand yourself.    Without other people, WHO you are is going to be difficult to understand, and suddenly things like your "identity" becomes confusing when you don't have anyone to identify yourself too, or to compare yourself too, or the entire social system that was required to make "you." You can't be extroverted, funny, or good or bad without society, unless you find ways to uphold these ideas even without the society... and you recreate an association between the old context, and your new context, through which you can maintain that. Maybe you could still see yourself as an ethical and  "good" person if you decide to go hungry for the day because you decided not to shoot the doe with the baby... here you are able to relate the love between a human mother and child, and apply this to your new situation... and your decision not to hurt these deer, or to not abandon the baby to the wild... these social rules against hurting baby and mother may not really apply to this situation... we don't know that they know love... we don't know that they feel fear like we do... but we need to understand where we are and so we apply it here... so that we can be compassionate... and so for a little while we know where and what we are. We need to relate to the external world in order to maintain our "self image." Without it, you are just a consciousness... separated from a reality... which is what many people think death to be.      It becomes hard for the person to answer further questions like... what should "I" do? "Why should "I" be? Things like purpose and will become very confused without a sense of WHO or WHAT you are. All of those ideas like soul and will, they disappear unless you recreate a new idea of who you are without society, why you are without society, and are able then to decide what you should be doing... if you do not however... that is when people can't find a purpose to life, a will to live... without the society... unless you create a new purpose... the only reason to eat and to try, and to do, is to survive... if that isn't good enough... you don't.    That is my interpretation. What do you think?|`|JSunIpPRaa	In traditional societies, if you were shunned, no one would speak to you or help you, and eventually you would die. If not of psychosis, of needing food, medical help, a second person to help you lift something, etc. In our society, if you are an adult and ostracized in one place, you can relocate. And technology replaces people in many tasks, so you don't need to heat your own space with wood and carry your own water and make clothing from scratch, so being shunned is less destructive.|`|AA10394958	i face that every day.    and when people try and emphasis it to me i just say.    well i ain't dead yet now do you want to shoot me and put me out of my misery now.    but hay i can live with it.

uXqDYPNVaa	I've never believed that most men want a woman to take care of them domestically. It's a relatively outdated desire.|`|dXyR1R8Yaa	Well I consider myself a feminist, but only by the means that I appreciate what the first waves of feminism did for us (getting us the right to vote, work and equal pay etc.) I can assure you I do not want any special privileges and do not fit into what most people on this site define as a feminist.     From my personal experience I would say that most guys do not expect me to take care of them. I love your breakdown of what you want in a relationship - I think a man who wants this should hopefully find themselves in healthy relationships. I know there are some jerks out there, but most the guys I know have no prejudice against women.     And as for those few men who want women to cook and clean for them. I have no problem with that so long as they want this from their partner because they feel they cannot do it as well themselves, and not because they think it is the duty of a woman.|`|oTwymgpIaa	I'm not a feminist, but I know more men that are supported by their wives and girlfriends or their welfare checks, than the other way around, which leads me to believe the majority of men do just want a slave that will play mommy to them, and trap them in a relationship by having children that they can use against them, while putting little to no effort into the relationship and going out with their buddies and getting high and drunk spending money that is needed for the children. Before you go and find yourself a woman you should ask yourself why you want one in the first place. They want the woman to support them and cook and pick up after them, but men have become bitter because women have refused to be their lap dogs. Since feminism has combined the roles of the male and female gender, anything is considered acceptable to men and women alike. It is only those who value and respect each other that truly find happiness. You can't put demands on love or it will fail every time. I would tell anyone I know to remain single, whether they are a man or a woman that has ideals that it is the males or females responsibility to play a specific part because the true nature of love is appreciating and valuing each others company, if you don't have that, then someone is going to be very unhappy in the relationship, usually the woman. Your life partner should be your best friend, someone you hold in the highest regard, and someone you enjoy spending your time with more than any other person. The first time a man told me he felt it was my duty as a woman to cook and clean for him and remain barefoot and pregnant, is the day I lose all respect, love and admiration for the man. If he can't respect me as an equal, or respect my individual wants and needs, then he can kiss my @ss goodbye. You give because you want to, not because someone demands it, that is not love, it is pure selfishness, and controlling behavior, which means he doesn't see me as a person, but rather as a servant that he can use to fullfill his wants and needs while totally disregarding mine. ;-)|`|vVEnCP0faa	I think women just need to chill out and stop assuming all men are stuck in the 50's.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	If I could find a pleasant, attractive woman who would take care of my home , cooking , cleaning, errands and the like ( you know a "home maker") I would support her.

Lets face it: many feminists complain about men because basically they have no desire to have a man in their life. I don't have a problem with a woman not wanting a man, but I don't see that they need to try to justify their feelings by shouting about how "all men are rapists" "a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle" etc.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	IamSpock,  I don't mean to sound condescending, however you sound young. Are you married? Do you have children? Do you realize that what a person desires and wants out of life changes as we mature. Your guess that only 30% of men desire this trait from a woman is substantially to low. In fact, I have never met a married man who would reject such qualities in a wife. They would appreciate and welcome these gifts.

Let the school take it from there.  Go to the church leader and say the same thing.  Dress nicely and ask like a lady.  You will be surprised at the help you will get.    As for your friends, well, your goal now is to get your grades up.  They are not your freinds if they do not support you.      Lexi, you have got to calm down and get help.  Your mother is very stressed taking care of all those children and it seems she cannot be there for you.  You have to start caring for yourself.  Stop threatening and start action.  You can do it.      Antonio|`|hqBPRSenaa	I know it probably doesn't seem like it, but things do eventually get better. You just have to hang it there and push through it. I went through a really, really rough time in the end of 2007 that lasted until May/June 2008. I tried to kill myself four times, all obviously unsuccessful. Now life is amazing. So, coming from someone who's been there, it's not worth it to kill yourself.    You're here for a reason. You could've been born an ant and been practically worthless, but you were born you. A person. A person capable of being something great and making a difference in someone's life, or even the world. Don't give up on that.    If you want, you can message me.  Good luck with everything.|`|URhKqq71aa	You will get older.  You will of get out of high school and get out on your own.    It is amazing how fast you lose touch with a lot of people, unless you are one of those scene kids who love their Facebook.    Give it time.  You'll grow out of it.|`|jb5v7kn0aa	I don't know what to tell you, but I hope it works out for you. Keep faith. Start thinking about college and the future. Talk to teachers you trust. Find someone at church to talk with you. Even just talking will help. You won't be under this forever. Trust me. Keep your chin up and don't let it discourage you. You're worth more than this! Best of luck! Blessings.
2bO7iiZdaa	Antifeminists have been saying the same things for three hundred years: feminists are against nature, against (your preferred religion), mannish, lesbian, just jealous, and above all, unattractive.   Women want to vote? Depriving men of their rightful authority - very unsexy! Women want to be able to have sex on the same terms as men? Ungodly *and* unfeminine! Women have the nerve to complain when men get preferential treatment? They must *hate* men (and by extension, everything that's good)!    I wouldn't say antifeminism has gone too far, since I'm not sure it's gone anywhere at all. If they'd learn that "i bet ur uglee" isn't a valid argument against, well, anything, that would be progress.|`|eBMKmgCjaa	What are some reasons that anti-feminism has gone too far?  LOL! Fond of leading questions much?    Is anti-feminism promoting gender equality, or trying to protect the superiority of men politically, economically, religiously, or socially?    As far as I can see anti-feminism is about promoting information regarding the serious state that feminism has got into today. I want people to realize that modern feminism has gone WAY beyond equality, and is now very busy with giving special rights to women and taking rights away from men.     I don't believe for a second that most feminists are interested in facing up to what is going on, but for those of you who care about what has happened to feminism, check out some of the links posted by anti-feminists on G&WS.    Btw  Edith  I have unblocked your account, so why don't you unblock mine?|`|F1mIcFoTaa	Men's websites are meaningless, utter waste of time. Whereas women's websites are interesting and they are definitely not mad, obsessed lunatics about the opposite sex. http://www.feministing.com/  http://www.womensspace.org/phpBB2/    It reflects men's personalities in real life as well. Funny, eh?|`|mMYDNuhPaa	The main reason for such groups: The perception by enough men that enough American women are nagging/sniping nasties that they need to organize and get their thoughts together. Not much different than (its counterpart) misled feminism of the 70s, 80s, and 90s.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	Men's Rights Activists, Anti-Feminists and the like are nothing more than common internet trolls. Once they amass together they institute vile attacks on their targets and drive women off the internet. They've done this several times, and gone so far as to contact the abusive ex-husband of a female blogger they particularly didn't like. Several high-profile feminist and women bloggers have been targeted, many have silenced themselves out of fear.    Anti-feminists are a loose cabal of internet terrorists. They excuse the real suffering of women and hound the women that disagree with them using as much abusive and illegal power as they can hold while retaining their anonymity. They are sick disgusting human beings. I know that almost every single female that identifies with feminism receives threatening emails often. From this site alone, I've gotten 5. 5 emails which would be legally considered threats and harassment in a court of law.    For those who consider themselves anti-feminists and proclaim that they don't do such things, you still write off the real subjugation of women every time you open your mouths. You support and agree with internet terrorists.    Anti-feminists went too far the first time they excused the rape of a woman or the killing of a wife by her ex-husband. Now they've gone past what is considered "too far" into the realm of terrorism.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Both of those sites I think are funny because I doubt it's done with any serious belief in what they're saying.     Kinda the way I love Maddox and laugh at what he says, because it's clear (at least as I see it) that it's just meant to be funny and rile up anyone who believes they're saying things as they 'should' be or believe truly in what they're saying.     I think there's anti-feminists out there who don't hate women, but do believe feminism is about supremacy. I don't agree with them, but I think they're serious about what they say and truly believe it. Who knows, they may be right. Doesn't change my belief in the 'original' feminism, this is what I believe in. I have no idea what 'modern feminism' is about or doing. I doubt they're right, but eh, I could very well just not be seeing what they're seeing.    Others do just hate women over all, but I'd think, judging by the real world, that there aren't many of these, and they're hardly the majority when it comes to men, probably not even the majority when it comes to anti-feminists.     In real life, I really don't ever see issues with feminism, for it or against it, so this is a strange but interesting little bubble going on here haha =o)    As long as they're not anyone who does real harm to others, I accept people will believe things I think are silly or completely moronic, or things that I feel are hard to understand but may have some merit. If they're not hurting anyone or attempting to, then all I can do is accept they're out there and try not to be bothered.|`|DxohE884aa	the latter.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	Anti-feminism exists because feminism has gone too far. That said, mabtw is run by self-described chauvinists, not anti-feminists who simply oppose feminism. I don't agree with either of those sites by the way.|`|YwE5kIB8aa	i'm anti-feminist, not anti-woman.  Thanks Jenny for being a true blue anti-feminist yerself and helping out the cause.  Cheers to you.    Jenn-I have never threatened you, sure I think overall you are a irrational and ridiculous person, but if you think to shame me by calling me a terrorist because I think you're full of shat, just like your precious feminism you truly are delusional.  It's your feminism and its rhetoric from it's ilk that has put me (proudly I might add) into my ideological position.  I mock you and you're self-righteous, self-serving, play the victim values.  Report me if you want, or anyone else, it'll just prove i'm right.  If anything is keeping women down, it's the lies of feminism!|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	There's no such thing as "anti-feminism", that's a myth created by certain radical feminists who resent not being taken seriously.  If you actually look at the history of the Feminist movement you will see that the term "feminism" has been used to mean so many things for so long, many of them mutually contradictory, that it has lost any precise definition of it's own, that's why any discussion of the subject tends to devolve into nothing more than an argument about what Feminism actually is.  This being the case "anti-feminism" can't have any meaning either since there can be no antithesis without a thesis.|`|wfE3mo7Naa	men are the people who run the world and make the money    women make them sammys and have babies    dont argue w/ genetics|`|emOhSyY5aa	What makes you think that? You must really be against men. I have seen no such evidence of any forms of superiority over men. Feminists are always making claims that are not true to make men look bad.|`|P1VXjLPOaa	How does expressing ones beliefs, even if those beliefs contradict your own, constitute anti-feminism. The examples of anti-feminism rhetoric you provided are weak.|`|mvui4Bbqaa	This proves the point that feminism has nothing better to argue. And the feminist have nothing better to do. Why do you even care about sites like those? What difference does it make if you hate their sites and they hate yours? Get over the name calling and then things might actually work out for the best.|`|4KlVkaDaaa	Anti-feminists seem to want to protect their unearned, privileged status, economomically, politically, socially, etc.  They want the old system of free labor from controlled women.      They do not discuss the issues of equality.  They simply make insulting comments using stereotypes.  Their few attempts to show inequality of men always involves a random, unusual example and has nothing to do with the general state of gender equity.  I could come up with single examples of terrible men, terrible women, you name it, but most of those examples would not apply to the general state of affairs.  You state the fact "women get paid less than men doing the exact same job."  Instead of admitting this is clearly wrong, they revert to insults about women needing to stay in kitchens.  It's impossible to take them seriously if they can't acknowledge basic facts.  They haven't convinced me of anything except that they really think women should be treated like second class citizens.  All the more reason for feminism.  When they say it's "outdated," I wish it was, but I live in the real world and see real inequality.  I look at their own insulting comments, including the ones where some tool says women should be at home waiting on men.  No thank you.  Feminism is still clearly necessary.  They hang themselves.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	The first is about the discontent of some men with american women, I do not see how that would fit antifeminism. They do not even mention feminism.    Similiar story with menarebetterthanwomen.com which is probably brought to you by the doctor phil show to create controversion.    There is not anti feminist movement that iam aware of. I mean who would be prominent anti feminists, what would be well known anti feminist literature, what legislations did antifeminists passed or blocked ?     Not only has it not gone too far it did not even start.

I would. Do it. Save the poor girl :( Your friend can deal.|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	Yes.  Do so.  The decider is this: How will you feel if you don't and your friend carries through with his intentions and basically nearly ruins the gal's life?  His planned "punishment" is way out of line (too severe) for high school mistreatment, making fun of him.  You may lose your friend, though.|`|gmpW9nmgaa	yes tell her|`|fofzdoROaa	This model/millionairess engaged to your best friend probably is already well aware of how easily she might be fooled and consequently you don't really need to tell her about it.
6ahTfnVuaa	To dream that you are in a movie theater, indicates that you are attempting to protect yourself from your emotions and/or actions. Viewing them on a movie screen projects them onto another person and thus makes those feelings/actions distant . You may be protecting yourself from experiencing them.    To see your grandmother in your dream, represents nurturance, protection, and unconditional love. Consider the qualities and characteristics that exist in your own grandmother.     To dream that you are drunk, suggests that you are acting careless and insensible. You are losing control of your life and losing a grip on reality. Perhaps you are trying to escape from a waking situation.    It might mean you want to see your grandmother, before she passes away, so she can have picture of you to remember in her heart forever.|`|uy6sBhipaa	You will be a porn movie star.

It's just your subconscious tossing a lot of images at you.  So just let it go.  Some people have very vivid dreams.  Some people have very boring dreams.  Some people remembers theirs.  Some don't.  But none of it has any real significance.  I've read a lot of scientific literature on this and all it means is your subconscious mind is working away at filing info from your waking life.

sE94HgDBaa	Well, I didn't have a KenDoll either but I don't remember having a conversation like that.  I think in my case my parents were either too cheap or poor to get us more than one doll- - they never made it seem wrong to have a male doll, just wrong to have too many dolls since they are only for fun and not necessary items.  I never had enough toys, in my opinion when I was a child.  I think I had one Barbie and my sister had one Barbie and my parents thought that was enough Barbie.  A cousin had bought my sister another Barbie on her birthday, so we cut one Barbie's hair off and pretended she was Ken.  I know, it's pretty lame and ghetto of us but it's what we did.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Be happy she didn't!     Ever see those girls who had Ken dolls?    Unhealthy fear of the bulge, terrible haha =o)|`|NYU37jfGaa	Maybe she was worried Ken would get Barbie pregnant.|`|dO5D1zhkaa	I think that your mother just had a conservitive background, and thought that a man doll for a girl was sick. ( Even though i do think its a little twisted.) She probably didnt want you experimenting or anything......  Im sorry that that was tramatizing and all, but i dont think you should keep worring about it so much.   When you have kids, (if you want) then you can buy them whatever dolls you want so they wont have to go what you went through.|`|z60J0Z9Daa	Ken dolls used to be atomically correct....She might have been remembering that.    My mother used to talk about that, that ken dolls had their own little package that was fairly detailed.  As we are about the same age, I'm guessing our mothers are pretty close in age as well.|`|HimBbU6caa	I have a bad tendency to visualize what I read. All I can see is your mother chuckin' that doll up against the wall. A no look pass over the shoulder that caused one arm to pop off while one leg was bent beyond repair.

Lrb8uVh9aa	Try pushing yourself to do things that you're afraid of, like talking in a group. You'll probably find that once you've done it, you'll realise it wasn't as bad as you thought and it'll encourage you to be more outspoken in the future.   Also it's important to feel good about yourself, so do some things to make you feel at your best, like having a new haircut or buying clothes that really suit you.   Learn to be more outspoken among your close friends and family, and gradually that confidence will come across when you're talking to strangers.   Good luck :)|`|AR5Q5jk6aa	I have the same problem...for some reason im really shy around people. Getting over shyness isn't just something you can do. It's like telling a little kid to run across 100 football fields at once. You just have to work at it.  I've found that I'm at my most out-going point when I'm with my friends. I think it's because my friends know me well enough so if I do or say something wrong, I won't care. I can just be myself around them.  Honestly if I'm with my friends I can walk up to any stranger and have a conversation. So for now stick with people you feel confortable around with like good friends to help you feel more out-going.  The reason most people are shy is because they care about what people around them will think of them and they're afraid they might do or say something the person around them doesn't aprove of. So work at not caring about that person. So what if you do something stupid? The next day they'll probably forget about it.  Another cause for shyness is often insecureity. Build up your confidence and be proud of yourself and who you are. And this links back to caring about what people think about you. People who are confident know that they're an awesome person and don't need other people to think that. And not caring about what people think of you won't stop you from doing or saying what you want. And that will make you more out-going.  So basiclly what I'm saying is if you want to overcome shyness, become more confident about yourself. Trust me, people are alot more worried about themself rather than you. No one's judging you. Good luck, hope I could help~ =]
d0927c1dee2a6f7c46226b1d817f8be6aa	Ugh, for me, the only signs of being an adult are paying for all my own bills.

If you hurt her back because of your extreme hatred for her, then where do you personally think will this take both of you to? It will be chaos. It is important for you to forgive her, even if she doesn't. If she cheated on you, then you just might as well meet up with her & try to work out things as friends. Inform her that you would take revenge by forgiving her, and say that, "If you wish, I will leave you forever, as you are happy with someone else."

If anything, the experience in itself made you stronger, didn't it? It made you a better person of some kind?    Understand that the experience, what she did, wasn't ALL bad. Once you realize this, you can begin to accept what happened, and come to terms with it.    Granted, this might take a long time, but it'll happen eventually. Once you accept what's happened and come to terms with it, you can begin to move on, and get her out of your head.|`|ojwRgCLqaa	Find someone else that makes you happy :) That will keep your mind of 'her'.

RC2aQBkgaa	Don't worry, you dream about whatever you think about right before you go to sleep in most cases. Sometimes dreams just come randomly, but it's been proven that you dream about what you think at night. You just think about him a lot or you did like him! Even if you didn't want to admit it to yourself. But it's nothing crazy, just a little crush :) Do you find yourself thinking about him a lot?

He could represent a completely different person(s), animal, or object in your life.    Maybe you believe that you need to be around other people to approach such a person, or that someone needs to see you around others in order to approach you. Perhaps, you believe that someone doesn't accept you for who you ARE, rather what you own, your friends, your clothing, or something else. Like, they're using you. Or maybe, you think, in the case of the first dream, that someone is always rejecting you, whether it be for someone else, something else, a belief, etc.    Think about your current life situations. Does anything seem similar? If so, try to calculate who/what this man represents, and fix things up.|`|DYdXrVVeaa	maybe ur subconsiously in luv!

It'll probably take you a few years to get it anywhere near sorted out, and you'll have to figure most of it out entirely on your own.|`|AA10988215	There wouldn't really be an answer to this I'm afraid because 'love' cannot be universally defined.  For example, a mother may 'love' her child, a stalker may 'love' his victim and a man may 'love' his playstation3!!!  Would we say these people feel the same love for each of these objects of affection?  It might be easy to say no, but maybe they do-we don't know!  Even comparing love on a similar level, like between 2 sets of pensioners celebrating golden wedding anniversaries, we cannot be sure that each of the couples, or even each husband and each wife, are actually feeling the same love.    Therefore, there are no physiological signs of love, because it's difficult to define what love is!    Hope this helps.

That's scary because I wake up thinking I really fell. lol! Just don't worry. Or if you are worried go to a psychologist or something.    Oh yea I got this from a website:    To dream that you are being kidnapped, denotes feelings of being trapped and restricted. Someone or some situation may be diverting your  concentration and your attention away from your goals.     To dream that someone has been kidnapped, indicates that you are not letting aspects and characteristics of that person be expressed within you. You are trying to contain and/or suppress those qualities of the kidnapped person.     To dream that you are a kidnapper, signifies that you are holding on to something that you need to let go.  You may be forcing your views and opinions on others.|`|1c83832e4e75e687e416ee7572b46990aa	you might be psychic, be careful.|`|Wt81sGW5aa	that ur insane HA HA HA!!!!!!!! jk i dont know|`|Phd9irMmaa	this dream means you are scared  of something or someone|`|2xa4414maa	Dreams are almost never about what they seem to be, so don't be freaked out. A dream like this could mean there's a problem in your life that you're not facing or there's something you're running away from. It could also just be that you've seen too many thriller movies recently.|`|ayC3MsEWaa	I wouldn't worry about those kinds of dreams because it is just your sub conisuss mind working as you sleep. These dreams won't nessesarily mean anything. They are like nightmares. The people in your dreams could have been charaters of a tv show or a movie. There is no need to worry though|`|SSFauVw0aa	THERE NOT DREAMS|`|BfpchxN2aa	You are just having nightmares it means nothing.|`|AyoxEkRTaa	dreams are just your thoughts right before you go to sleep, or right before you get up. there is only a few minutes during the night where your dreaming. so your pobably just thinking about it. if you watched anyhting on tv about it, that's probably the reason. or your just scared of something like that happening.
45d774f93cd8fa9f498a7d7487bd0caaaa	It is as if you want to feel guilt for not feeling guilty. In a way it is very good to not have a ferocious conscience nagging and biting you from within your own chest.    At least you have no pain.    Then what may matter more is your purpose, your glowing wish to try and improve your life, to abandon all simian behaviour, to try and live more healthy for your own sake, for your own future,    where excesses, and smoking weed and drinking a lot, are not allowed, resolutely excluded by yourself.    You might decide and secretly declare to yourself that "from now on" you will ardently diligently try and build up some good glowing memories for a future.    Have a laugh.|`|gmpW9nmgaa	as long as it is under control and in moderation i wouldn't worry, are you by any chance in your teens? i was the same when i was 15 no big deal.|`|RAOrCnonaa	Because you're not doing it to rebel. You're just doing it because you want to. As long as you're doing these things in moderation there's nothing to be ashamed of.|`|pf8OEAG6aa	you're not doing anything to hurt them or anything  just be easy and don't say anything.. don't start desrespecting them..  do everything they ask you to do.. and it'll be alright|`|oNg8zGi8aa	Because it corrupts your principals and morals . Get smart before it's to late .|`|fofzdoROaa	Why should you feel guilt? has anybody told you that it is wrong?    HOWEVER, what I am telling you is that it is harmful to your health and strongly advisable for you to stop smoking weed and over-indulging in alcohol. If it is a rebellion, then you are rebelling only against yourself and your body alone!     Hope this makes you feel guilty!|`|2RkDecZwaa	Because if youre not getting into any trouble or harming anyone and youre just having fun... then you are not doing anythang wrong.
wz8gx3gaaa	It means you have fear of heights.|`|xnIdDihRaa	Don't worry,first of all don't think about the dream which haunts you,try to divert your mind whenever anything of that dream comes to your mind,start reading books,talk to somebody,if you continue this,you will be benefited.|`|gP0AGtrqaa	i think your subconscience is trying to tell you that your performance is deteriorating..maybe in your workplace and your are or must try to buckle up. the same goes for maybe your personal life.
AAgX0SDcaa	She's extremely insecure, you are younger i think. She knows deep-down she can be replaced and by leaving out some things she is setting you up for failure or to make herself look superior. It's her word against yours (the doctor cant be there to hear everything she is telling you), and you are the flunkie. Hang in there, if I were you i would keep a diary and write these things down each day, that way you will have some sort of documentation if she tries to push you out the door. Sometimes mean people's tricks will backfire on them, have had it happen to me and my supervisor got kicked out and won't ever be hired back. Sure took long enough for it to happen though.|`|AA12316366	sounds to me she is insecure  about her job or fear of being replaced. IF it were me, i'd sort of roll with punches for a while and maybe things will sort themselves out. maybe try to be a little patient. but, that is how i would handle it.|`|DxohE884aa	Just act very confident, so that it's obvious she cannot walk all over you. Then don't get in her space - you're not threatening her job. You are just there to learn. If you think she is leaving out information that may hurt your job and career, call her on it. If she gets really aggressive, go to the doctor. It is his place to help make a safe working environment.  Good for you, supporting your family!|`|AA12219135	The woman has been in a position of control for a long time most likely.  The fact that she leaves out some of the most important details lets one assume that she is definitely afraid to divulge what is necessary to accomplish the tasks of "her" position.  She is most likely threatened.  She is trying to prevent the inevitable.  Unfortuanely, if you fail to follow through, she will do this to each future replacement and will eventually get fired, leaving the Doctor sort of helpless, which is what I think she wants, so that he will then "need" her.  Keep your eyes open, it will most likely not be long before you can accomplish all the tasks necessary without her help.  Chin up young lady, your future is sort of depending on it, it won't last long...  -smile-

5vcd7GHNaa	An example of a bipolar person:    Let's pretend Bob here is bipolar. His friend, Jane, comes to talk with him/.    Jane: HIIIII BOBBBBBBB!    Bob: HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII... OMG HOW WERE YOU?    Jane: GREAT! Let's go get a pizza!    Bob: .... No... thanks....    Jane: Why not? D:    Bob: YES YES YES I'LL COME! :D    Jane: YAY!    Bob: .... or not.    ---    Or if that didn't make sense, take Edward and Bella as an example.    Edward: .....    Bella: Oh, Edward, let me kiss you!     Edward: Don't touch.... me.... you ****    Bella: D:    Edward: Oh, Bella, hug me!!!    Bella: Huggies!

Kind of like a mood disorder. Nothing all that serious but can greatly interfere with your personal life.        -That Guy|`|Avh3PP5kaa	Ok the word bi means 2 and polar means different characteristics or personality. So when you put the words together they mean 2 different or split personalities/characteristics.|`|33ppbrMJaa	I believe it means that a person is emotionally unstable, slipping into chaotic highs filled with energy and gaiety, then falling into a pit of deep, dark depression.  During those highs, the person frequently does things like run up charges on credit cards, refuses to rest, runs on a high dose of energy, while the lows are desolate indeed, sometimes even suicidal.      I hope I am right in this, because I am no psychiatrist, but I have read about it and understand there are medications that help these people keep themselves on an even keel.  The biggest problem is getting them to take their medication properly.|`|Izv6Qj4caa	http://health.yahoo.com/mentalhealth-ove...|`|GjeEbxkzaa	um a mood disorder?|`|faKgix2Qaa	omg my mom said bi polar on the phone and im like what does that mean so im just as confused as you are lol|`|EvMZJ6eyaa	Some one who has an issue with emotions.

7jM9Ghchaa	this is so true money when you do not have any can be hard and when the bills come rolling in and its birthday party times and food to buy ?and when you are loaded all is well happy and buy what you like?|`|w5OawaG5aa	It can be hard to be happy in any circumstances. However, not having money causes problems and arguments - so if you had enough of it not to worry about money then it would be easier to just worry about important things. Also, it is harder to be happy without money in other ways - for example if you and your partner want to do something fun and have no money you have to think hard about things you can do that won't cost you money - if you have money you could just do anything you thought of. The danger comes when you start taking it for granted.|`|9w9Q83tFaa	A very great lady stated that' if you wish to be really happy live simply'  in other words to take only what is needed to feed and clothe you and your family, although this  would not be entertained in our greed ridden society there is a lot to be said for it, happiness comes from within not from without, the papers are full of celebrities who are not happy and flit from one lover to the next and one fad to the next trying to find that elusive happiness but it all boils down to what you are and not what we try to be.  The great lady who said the above quote?  the Virgin Mary in a vision to seers at Medjugore in the former Yugoslavia:1981 to the present day.|`|vY5HUrQPaa	Of course it's easier to live happily with money. But the key thing is having the wisdom to know how to live and to use money wisely.     Wisdom is a defense even as money is a defense, but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom shields and preserves the life of him who has it.     And where does wisdom come from? God, who is Wisdom, Knowledge, and Understanding. He gives these gifts and more to those who keep a right standing with Him. If you don't have this relationship, just ask Jesus Christ to come into your heart, to forgive you of any sin. Thank Him for dying for you so you can have eternal life. Believe He's the Son of God who has risen from the dead. Tell Him that you'll live for Him.    Then stay in contact by talking to the Lord everyday, and follow His Life Manual (the Bible) daily, starting with St. John.. Make friends at a local Bible-teaching  church and tell others about Jesus.|`|FrZkfexqaa	I don't think you need to be a millionaire to be happy but I do think you need security to be happy, there is nothing worse then fighting over money or having not enough money to cover the bills at the end of the month, been there done that, especially when you have kids, lets face it, you need a certain amount to live I'm only being realistic and the people that say otherwise are only fooling themselves, when you have 3 kids and can't buy them school clothes and give them lunch money or a normal christmas what's so fun about that? If you do choose that kind of life style thats fine for you but don't get married and don't bring kids into the world because they don't have a choice and they may not like your values and growing up poor and they may resent you for the rest of there life, these days you can't even give them a descent education without money, it's not right I'm saying in fact it's sad and unfortunate but it is what it is !  And we all need that security, and there's a big difference between security and being spoiled rotten, and I've been both.  And yes happiness does come within but it sure helps soften the blow when you have a nice place to fall and a nice home to come home to, instead of a card board box,|`|VncSMLMpaa	Our present lifestyles require money just to feed and clothe ourselves. We do need a certain amount to pay the bills and life would not be happy without it. But money alone cannot guarantee happiness, a contented mind does.|`|AA12349214	Nope.  Some of the best times we had were when we were first married and hadnt a bean.  We're still happy but we are more solvent and it does make a difference in some ways but you certainly dont need it to be happy!|`|78Xb7enMaa	Money gives you choices and opportunities you don't have without it. Personally I'm much happier with it than without it. Happiness is a choice, money alone doesn't guarantee it, it comes from within.|`|nRFZwdN4aa	Studies show that beyond an income that meets basic needs, money makes very little difference on happiness. The gross national happiness in developed countries like the U.S. and France is actually below some less wealthy countries like Mexico.     However, my opinion? If you are single, you need money more than people with strong connections. If you are alone, money will make life WAY less stressful, particularly if you have a lot of it. If you don't have a support network, who will help you through a serious illness? Money. Money can buy you support to some extent, like caregivers, psychologists or other resources.     In conclusion, it is much harder to be happier without money to ensure a feeling of security. However, if you are wired to be melancholy, it is not sufficient. Sometimes wealth can own you, because you fear losing it.
8kpcRyCnaa	You have something called a comfort zone.  We all have them, basically what defines this zone is everything that we are comfortable about is in the zone and everything that could possibly make us uncomfortable is outside it.  You don't have as much experience as some of the people around you in socializing.  Fortunately the only thing that you have to do is challenge the barriers of your comfort zone.  Look for other people in school that are singled out and seem to also have the same problem socializing.  Always say 'Hi' when you see someone.  Smile.  Even if you don't feel it, smiles have a funny way of coming true.    Finally, be patient and forgiving of and with yourself.  No one is perfect, and yet the world still turns.  You need to make mistakes so that you can learn how to communicate with people the right way.    Just remember this "You miss every shot you don't take."|`|653j6x9maa	im shocked reading this becuase my whole life ive been exactly like u. likeing beating at school but not talking to anyone then get home and its boring and depressing... i finally got tired of it, and i tried my very best to make a friend, i looked for smoeone that didnt already have a lot of friends, and someone that seemed like a good person, and im 20 now, weve been best friends for a couple years :) and even you dont see eacho other on the weekends its nice to have someone to talk to on the phone too, also, this isnt good advice but, i have many friendsnow, basicly becuase i drink alot and when im drunk im very sociable, so maybe wehn u get older and start drinkning youll meet people lol. good luck sweety.   find someone online that could be your friend and talk to u all the time too :)  sorry about the typos im pretty drunk|`|Ss4bkvDgaa	Nope, it's basically the same thing in middle school.
NSKimt1Qaa	No, I understand.  The only difference is that I always had parties thrown for me by my parents when I was a kid.  They always made it a big deal and I always felt like that was my special day.  I think that's the way it should be.  When I became an adult, I still felt like it was my special day and I thought that maybe I was being a wuss when my husband acted like it was nothing at all.  Now, I say I am right about it, and was all along. Your birthday will always be a very special day for you and you should always take care to celebrate it in some way, even if no one else around you does.  Hopefully, though, there are some people, friends, relatives, your kids, who will remember your birthday with you.    I feel such a connection with you sometimes.  You seem to mirror my thoughts, and we both seem to have spouses who are into themselves. I say it's time we started thinking or ourselves more!  And, Happy Birthday to you again!  I will keep saying this to you so you know I mean it.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Yes, but for different reasons. I'm torn between being depressed because I'm getting older and thankful that I'm still alive.|`|dWLGK7nlaa	Happy Birthday Eddie!!! Yes, for some crazy reason I was depressed when I turned 30, now I am depressed I am not 30. Have a great day! Did you even get a cupcake??|`|WlywfjG1aa	Well as you grow old , how the birthday goes depends on people around you than yourself. If your kids , wife and most importantly people in office and social circle take initiative in celebrating your birthday , things could be very exciting ( and romantic also ! ) on your birthday.|`|3r3xWRwPaa	Happy Birthday!  Well sometimes we have expectations on what we should be doing, and compare ourselves to what we think everyone else is doing.  Tell your partner that you want to get out, somewhere you like, it doesnt matter if you initiate it, just enjoy the evening!|`|GIxvzkA9aa	You're DEFINITELY right. I feel the same way. Besides 16, 18, and 21, birthdays blow.|`|OtYAkRrRaa	I wouldn't say you're a wuss you just don't want it to be just another day.   So stop waiting for someone else to make your day. Throw yourself your own party!  For example:     On my birthday I buy myself a small cake and ice cream 'cause I like mixing them together.  :)  If i'm not working I do as many fun things as possible.   Do fun things that you wouldn't ordinarily do.  Take yourself shopping or go out to the movies.   Try a new activity. Try fantasy football.  It's your day. Have fun!!!|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Join the club!     I can't tell if its really your birthday or not.. So just incase    HAPPY BIRTHDAY!    So far, He bought me a subway sandwich and I ate in the car as we sat in a self serve car wash on the way to get taxes done.
ecL0ZbfCaa	People tend to find me quiet and perhaps lacking in confidence but I'm very opinionated, so when I do open my mouth I get accused of being an obnoxious *****!   To answer your question, I do tend to upset people but not deliberately.|`|cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	Most first meetings I come across a "nice guy". Then when these turn into "I want something" I am considered a bit on the un-trusting side. When a new person pushes for the "I want something" I turn ruthless. My friends are those that usually get everything from me because there was never a "ploy" involved. They liked me for who I am and found I am overly generous to a fault. But, I guess it's the timing between the "hello" and the "I want something" that turns me negative.|`|GjeEbxkzaa	ruffle feathers mostly....|`|2f1IEC1Qaa	in person i am to quiet to be likable|`|Kl4kv5khaa	Maybe not as interesting compared to some, but like-able.|`|sP8KrvA7aa	Actually I make a good first impression for sure.  Afterwards, it depends on how the person treats me. If they're nice to me, I'm nice to them. If they act like a jerk/***** , I speak to them as little as I can.

Then, he made me stay after the practice to do more pushups. I was already late for my orchestra rehersal.     On the way there, I had my first car accident (at 12 yrs of age), and I hyperventilated and passed out.     Now, I am trying to calm down.

uBX7R6xvaa	This dream seems to represent your current situation and the anxiety related to it very well.  A giant hotel might be a nice place to get together with your friends from the old school, but a cruise ship would be even more fun.  So I can easily see why you would make the switch in your dream.  You most likely will miss having fun with these friends you are pretty comfortable with.  The wheel chair would indicate that you felt like you were disabled in some way, and not able to participate in having this fun with your old friends as you would like.  Even enjoying being together in a nice atmosphere with nice scenery is prevented from working out because of something not being quite right(Train tracks in the dream).  You and your friends find it is quite a journey to try to find the mansion which I guess would be a place like home for you and your friends from the old school.  You get distracted by seeing possible friends from the new school who you seem to be too shy to connect with and lose track of your friends.      It will take some work to adjust to new friends and it may be easy to lose track of your best friends from your previous school.  Life can be tricky, you just have to have faith that over time you will get more comfortable with the new school environment and find friends who will be compatible with you.  One can still try to keep some connection with your good friend from your old school even if it could be somewhat difficult at times to do.    Meditate/pray, do mind-body or other exercise(not excessively), and eat healthy, so that you will stay strong spiritually, so as to be able to draw positive type friends to you by means of having a friendly persona.

The only thing i can really say is time is the greatest healer, and in time u will feel better. I dont no any good solutions because im in the same pickle as u r :( if i find out any more information on how to help i will tell u.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	It takes time.  In time thoughts of him will be replaced with thoughts of someone else whose image may be placed in the thoughts that fill your mind.  Usually we develop expectations about life and those expectations are filled with the idea that they will be shared with someone else.  You need to develop at least a part of your life that is not dependent on sharing it with someone else.  Your self esteem and self image must be slowly developed such that you are independent and have a life of your own.  Then when you develop a relationship, the person does not become an essential part of who you are, at least until some commitment has been formed.|`|u4FU1RlEaa	Not much that i can say that you wouldn't already know. I know exactly how you feel, i feel it right now, i miss my ex like hell, i still check his facebook most days and we haven't been with going out for 10 months (now that sounds sad lol)     Time really is is the biggest healer. Other than that not much can fix a broken heart, try your hardest not to think about him, and focus everything onto something else that you love?  I know its hard, but everyone goes though it and there isnt much that anyone can say to help that
PUhO0B74aa	I've talked to a lot of people about this exact thing - good question.    The consensus we have come to is that alcohol is indeed a "depressant" and it takes a day or so to be eliminated from the system.  It makes you feel good while you keep pumping it in, but after you stop, you've got to deal with "coming down."    It's normal, but the "down" feeling can be further enhanced if you're feeling bad about something.      "Ups" seem to be counteracted with "downs," which is probably why little kids who are acting out and laughing hard end up crying (because they get all worked up).     My mother always mentions that when my siblings and I acted "too silly" and it got out of hand when we were little, we'd always ended up fighting/ and or crying.  I think it's sort of the same thing.|`|75vfUQVNaa	First, you need to find out what you are feeling guilty about. You can't possibly feel guilty 'cauz you went out to have fun. That's not the root of your guilt.|`|nbAodlgQaa	Are you thinking about someone else who's not having fun, maybe someone you think you should be helping ie. a close friend who's been down? I know that's how I feel sometimes--it's a feeling of selfishness because you're feeling good when you know someone else isn't. If this is it, you have to remind yourself that you have a life to live as well, and that you will help this person when you can and however it is you can.|`|jTh0Vf7saa	Maybe you are wound up a little too tight, I am the same sometimes. If you are stuck in a rigid routine and never really push the boat out, Having fun can seem alien and make you feel like you have acted silly or out of place. But its healthy to let your Hair down from time to time so dont feel guilty! x
X2b7kMtHaa	As you probably know, the ability to be Hypnotized is a very individual thing. Research suggests that about 10% of the population is extremely Hypnotizable and about two-thirds of us are capable of at least some level of induction. (Yep, thats at least a 76.66% majority)!    Hypnotizability appears to be at least part genetic and affected by significant life events until youre about 16 years old. Also, despite popular belief, Hypnotizability is not significantly related to personality traits like assertiveness, basal anxiety or intelligence.    My wife can Hypnotize herself and fall asleep in a matter of seconds while I only have mild suggestibility. She started with hypnosis very young so maybe that's important too. Practice makes perfect!|`|cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	As far as the self help hypnosis videos go, it's true they are worthless. The ones that cost a bit are the ones that work. The thing you are failing at in relation to the outcome not being positive is 2 fold. 1) you are not buying into the hypnosis. and 2) you are not relying on the one thing that makes them work best. Repetition! My wife had a hypnotist help her lose weight. It didn't work. He came back from the bathroom with a few wet spots on his pants and that was all she could think of. $250 down the drain. 20 years later she picks up a DVD /CD hypnosis on losing weight and 6 months later she is over 66 pounds lighter. What was the key? She believed it could work and she watched the video, and listened to the C/D repetitively. The video she watched 3 times, but, the audio she listens to once or twice a day, every day. This repetition is what ingrains the thought into her mind. So, if you want to succeed in whatever area you are trying the hypnosis in, remember to buy into it and repetition of the suggestions. If you want the name of the hypnotist e-mail me. My wife is at work but I can call her and get you the information and maybe even send you the audio somehow (kids are computer genius's freaks me out what they can do)
EQXARVlVaa	Reading is not only about the act of doing so but rather it aids your ideas and thoughts to connect together. By this new neuron path ways are created in side your brain therefore you can think quicker and ultimately feel sharper. We are always put under the notion that our physique is the most central of our being however, without our brain the physical part means nothing. I think reading is the best way to stimulate your brain and keep it active. Keep on reading that is my last advise.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Very, I hope! I read a lot.|`|ed7803f645a13205fd2cb80b16fdc318aa	The mind is liken to a computer/ muscle. I am 66 yrs old. I read and answer questions on this web to help keep my mind sharp. I also teach h.s. If I were to not read, I would lose memories and will retrogress into an old man with nothing but old memories to conjure up to keep me happy.Use it or lose it. I think you need to take heed to the latter statement. It is a known fact that one should exercise the body. Is not the brain a part of the body?
29maScwJaa	They're probably fake and just trying to hide their crap-life. Life isn't good, its not good enough to be genuinely happy around everybody. I hate the people who act like life is so awesome and great, and get in stupid awkward conversations with everyone they met that consist of them asking how the other person is doing, then they reply theyre good and the other person says that theyre good too. NO YOU'RE NOT ALL GOOD! The world sucks.|`|AA12299134	They are there to show you that happiness CAN be achieved, and that you also have the ability to be happy yourself.  They are a reflection of the Universe so to speak.    The way for you to find happiness is to go out and buy yourself a blank journal.  That is your 'blessings journal' and then once a week, list the things in your life which have made you happy in the past week.  Good things, good events, positive developments, pieces of good news you have heard.    See if you can get 10 to start with - the more you think, the more you will find.  There are probably more good and happy things in your life than you realise.  Then these will become more numerous - count your blessings and they will multiply.  You will be putting your attention on the positives of your life, and that after a time, will activate a change within you whereby you feel grateful and happier.    Secondly, take a blank piece of paper and list the beliefs you have about your life at the moment.  There will probably be a lot of negatives in there which you need to change if you are going to feel happy in life.  Change these to more positive thoughts and then begin to think and repeat them accordingly.  ie: 'I just can't find happiness in whatever I do' becomes 'I am finding happiness in whatever I do.'      You will find that this too activates a change within you and in your mind where you start to think and feel more positive about yourself and your life...and you would be surprised what starts happening when you start to do that.|`|GjeEbxkzaa	they're dying inside.|`|5ktSlNodaa	When you're depressed everyone's happy.

I believe it is what you put out there that makes all the difference in the world.     Look at what you wrote, "I just can't find happiness in whatever I do." Ok, this may sound silly but try it. Get two 3X5 index cards and write the phrase, "I will find two things about myself that I am happy with today" on each one. Put one on the mirror in the bathroom and put one in your wallet where you keep your cash. Every time you see these cards, say the words out loud.     Put positive energy into the universe. Your mouth speaks from the heart. Put positive things out of your mouth, and positive things will come to you.    How many times have you heard this? "I always end up with the same kind of bf or gf.

Mnm35sjNaa	Darwin's natural selection tells us that our greatest attribute (intelligence) is necessarily evolved to do what it does: make choices.  Whether or not free will is God-given, evolved or an illusion is not really the issue.  We do, in fact, make choices.  The real question is: In a deterministic universe, ruled by causality, can free will also exist?    There's no proof for ANY answer.  I, personally, believe that free will coexists with determinism.  I believe living beings can't be viewed in the same light as inanimate objects (stars, planet, atoms, comets, chairs, rocks, etc.)  The free will we have is limited in as much as our options are limited.  We are not gods and are confined to physical laws.    The field of neuroscience has made large strides recently but the free will versus determinism controversy is nowhere closer to resolution.  Determinism and compatibilism have both garnered supporting evidence (though determinism seems to have the edge for now).  Google "CEMI theory" for more information about a leading theory that supports compatibilism.    For argument's sake, I'll assume there is a God who gave us free will.  If he did, then he can no longer intervene in human affairs: that would be usurping our free will.  That means that God CAN'T be a personal God who meddles in our affairs (answer prayers, perform miracles, slay enemies, wipe out cities, etc.).  Once he gave us free will, he switched from personal God to cosmic God . . . from meddler to observer.    But if God did NOT give us free will, we are simply puppets dancing to God's tune.  We would have no morality, responsibility or accountability.    Christian apologists have tried, for hundreds of years, to explain away this logical conundrum.  But they can't (without resorting to circular logic).  If you insist on a supernatural creator, then God either gave us free will or he didn't.  If he didn't, he judges and punishes us for lives we had no control over.  If he did, then all his interventions described in the bible contradict the free will he supposedly gave us.    The question of free will cuts to the core of scriptural legitimacy and reveals the lies that dogma is intended to cover up.|`|cfvAJJqdaa	you said that we decide to listen to the song. Exactly. You don't have to. You can switch it off. You can ignore your emotions.   Anyone with a fair amount of intelligence can realise why they like listening to an empty soppy love and realise it's because of the lyrics or it reminding you of someone rather than the lyrics being profound or it having a good beat.    I can't make sense of what you said.    The world's fake values and morals were made by religious people. I really can't make out the point sorry. It is a weird subject.     What do you think free will actually means ?     If you claim to believe in god (that he imbedded in us??) then you need to go back church because if you truly believed you would not be questioning this|`|xZBwnrGzaa	I had a similar problem a year ago. My question was: If our brains process data and make decisions about it, what is our universe? Is it just data that our brains try to trick us into thinking is an entire universe?   I just tried to forget about it. Anyway, onto the point. Think of a way to disprove yourself. Technically, you are right. We never get to LOGICALLY make decisions. But, our emotions are our logic. They are our will. Events, our genetics, and emotions shape us into who we are. Letting those things make the decisions really is ourselves making decisions. Make sense?|`|7p3TCz3qaa	Of course we have free will.It's true our past colours our behaviour/actions/emotions,but it's up to us,when we become adults of course,to choose whether to continue letting our past impact on our present and our future,or to make changes,making changes is using your free will.March to the beat of your own drum!|`|mYa5VxgPaa	FREE  WILL  as  you call  it      Its  really  call  chocies  you   chocies  to  feel the way  you  do at that time    your not  happy with  the  chocies  you  are  making  so  you are    curious   and trying  to find  out      , in other  words   you are learning  your  asking  question  about  a unsure  world   .

AA12020853	i have a great big void in my soul...this void is the result of feeling unfulfilled. i don't really set goals, just allow myself to float about moving with the current.

Hopefully, in time i'll get past this.|`|jTh0Vf7saa	I feel Like I have a lot to share with people but cant find a way to do it at the moment. Specifically, I need someone to care about and who cares about me too. This is the void I have, But I deal with it because I know it will be worth it when I finally find the part of me thats missing. Ive had this for a long time, but its only started to manifest itself in a serious way over the last year or so. Ive managed to fill the void in my self confidence that I had, im very approachable now and the new challenge is using this to communicate with people better, on a more emotional level :)
Rpa1hXXDaa	This sounds creepy. If you can handle it stay, if not you will have to go sooner or later. You could learn to deal with it to be watched. But do you want to deal with it? The only thing i can tell you this is not your problem  and you have done nothing wrong. sometimes it helps knowing that you have absolutly done nothing wrong to get better along with the problem.  I hope you can now manage it better.  Greetings from far away cold Germany.

33ppbrMJaa	Sure, we have all been depressed from time to time, but I think you should learn to like yourself a little more!  Remember you are a unique person, with your own feelings, your own opinions, your own thoughts. You are well worth knowing and listening to and learning from, and there are plenty of people on earth who would like to make a friend.    Have a little more confidence in yourself, smile at your acquaintances and walk along as though you have someplace to go, because you do. Even if you are alone, the world is filled with books, art treasures, movies, games. You are never really alone. You have the world as a companion.    So put your chin up and refuse to give in to those depressed feelings. Take long walks and note the beauty of the land around you.  If you just learn to say, "Hey, I'm a nice person after all!," you'll be just fine!
Lrb8uVh9aa	It's normal to feel like this from time to time, but if you've been feeling down for a while it might be a good idea to talk to someone. If you're feeling run down and tired, it might be worth speaking to your doctor, as your lowness could have a physiological cause, like anaemia. It might also be worth mentioning that you're feeling depressed- they could perhaps arrange some counselling for you.    I would speak to your family about how you're feeling- they may not even realise that they are making you feel shut out.    I expect your work mates also don't realise that they're making you feel bad- if you can, try to laugh it off- or jokingly tell them to leave you alone. If you think they would understand, you could tell them that it's annoying you.    If you're bored, try taking up something new. Write a list of things that make you happy, or things that you want to achieve, and try to do something off the list every week. Being around like-minded people could help, so go out with friends, or take up a hobby that you could meet new people through.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	I think you should loosen up and not take things so seriously.  It seems that if it bothered you so much, you would have thought of a pithy answer.

WYwqDaapaa	Psychology is the study of an individual's mental and behavioral functions. The focus is on the individual.  Sociology is the study of people within social systems.  It is broader than psychology in that it focuses the aspects of an individual within social environments.  They are interlinked because a person's psyche is directly influenced by the world around him/her.  Two people are born with exactly the same personality types will grow up to be vastly different based on their families, schooling, communities, life experiences, etc.  You also may want to throw some anthropology in the mix. This throws historical, cultural, environmental aspects into an individual's personality.
OtYAkRrRaa	I think you're right about some of what you said.  It really isn't fair. Even if you think you have fewer people that care. Who knows who or what you were created for? You could have been born to help a number of people get through similar circumstances.   If you cease to exist, someone will not get a chance to experience what you have to offer. You are worth far more than you think.  From a spiritual standpoint look at it like this. You are saying that God made a mistake in creating you. That there is no reason for your existence, but only he knows why he created you and i'm sure it wasn't an accident; but it will take you to explore your purpose.  Take the life you have and make a difference in someone else's who is less fortunate. Don't worry about what happens in the afterlife, it will happen when its time.   I wish you long life and happiness.|`|OdoLSDlXaa	I don't mean to insult you, but suicide is a symptom of mental illness, so there is a need for treatment when feeling suicidal.  Counseling and antidepressant medication together is what works best.  A suicidal person does not feel connected or supported by friends or family, but that is not reality; that is the illness.  A suicidal person is not in their right mind.  After the depression lifts, they feel much differently, not a burden; of course others aren't better off without them.  Of course things get better.    Secondly, suicide is a selfish act.  We are here to make the world a better place and to alleviate the suffering of others.  The world has enough death and suffering without adding to it.      Lastly, you state no concern over possibly going to hell for eternity.  Eternal suffering is a big concern for most people.  There are other possibilities too, like not so much eternal torment but eternal boredom, watching other people enjoy a heavenly afterlife while standing on the sidelines.   At best suicides will miss out on a lot of good things and positive feelings that eventually come.|`|MmfMJq9Paa	No it is not a valid option, It is a sin, Simply put, it is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

To die, to sleep;  No more; and by a sleep to say we end  The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks  That flesh is heir to  'tis a consummation  Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;  To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub,  For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,  Must give us pause. There's the respect  That makes calamity of so long life,  For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,  Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,  The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,  The insolence of office, and the spurns  That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,  When he himself might his quietus make  With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,  To grunt and sweat under a weary life,  But that the dread of something after death,  The undiscovered country from whose bourn  No traveller returns, puzzles the will,  And makes us rather bear those ills we have  Than fly to others that we know not of?  Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  And thus the native hue of resolution  Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,  And enterprises of great pitch and moment  With this regard their currents turn awry,  And lose the name of action.      It doesn't answer your question, I know, but it does show that great minds have thought the same things that you are currently thinking.|`|s89uFNyeaa	I didnt even finish reading your answer because I don't want you to try to validate suicide. There is no reason anyone should commit suicide. For one, it really is important to think about all the people that care about you. It would tear them up if they found out they could no longer spend time with you. And you should also think about the fact that you have people to care about you. If you feel like you have run out of people to care about you, then think about yourself. Don't ruin your opportunity to have a life where nothing is planned. You can really make your life whatever you want it to be, it only takes time. Everybody goes through rough patches, but you just have to wait it out.

OtYAkRrRaa	That's a good question. I get that mad sometimes but it doesn't lead to fighting. People don't fight like they used to. People used to get mad and fist fight. The issues were resolved when the person that beat the other person up won the fight.  Nowadays people use weapons and kill people about something they're mad about and get in worse trouble. You may want to look at it like that. Or, they end up in jail because they were mad. People have lost really good friends because they were mad and wanted to fight.  You have to ask yourself why you're angry?  Is it that the other person isn't entitled to their opinion?  Do you disagree with something they said or did?  If that's the case then you are exercising control over that person's reason for making you mad. You are saying they don't have a right to do what they are doing, etc.   I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  I answered a question yesterday and I said that peoples comments were misguided. That was wrong because those were their opinions.  Ask yourself what would fighting accomplish?

The long answer is that controlling those inner fires takes training.  And training starts when you aren't angry.  Training is 99% repetition.    Let me give an example, not anger related.  One technique taught safe drivers is to always have an "out" -- always have someplace you are going to put your car when something totally unexpected happens -- a deer runs right in front of you, the car ahead suddenly stops, your engine suddenly dies, and such quick, dangerous events.    The arousal of Anger is a very dangerous event too!  No one can operate well during a bout of anger any more than a car can be handled well when the accelerator sticks and the brakes fail at the same time.    So practice self-relaxation techniques again and again throughout the day, until those techniques become second nature.  Just like a trained driver can throw a car with a stuck accelerator into neutral without a thought, so too, will you be able to throw yourself into a relaxation method without a thought whenever your emotional accelerator gets jammed into Anger.      There are all sorts of relaxation techniques, counting to ten is one -- it's easy to apply since everyone has already known of it, but there are far better ones.    * * *    Just to follow-up based on a few other responses ... Often a person will find himself or herself in a situation where walking away is impossible.  What then?  Yes, removing yourself from a situation where there is a anger flare-up, or where your own anger will or already has flared up is excellent advice -- still those with fire in their souls often find themselves in situations where going away, or even turning away is not an option.    What then? Well, that's why I  gave my advice to do something that will force relaxation first.  Take a deep breath, count to ten, look up at the ceiling -- something.    There are many relaxation techniques, and it is helpful for anyone to learn a few.  There are simple phrases that a person can say to themselves that automatically cause the body to begin relaxing, there's no real magic, just the power of self-suggestion.  One is "My feet are warm".   Another "My heartbeat is steady."  Simple mindless repetition of those phrases causes the body to automatically relax.   Another phrase to try: "Relax, take a breath."  Synchronize the inhale with the word "take", the exhale with the word "breath".  Works like magic.    Another piece of advice is "swallow your pride" -- well, a false pride or an overly sensitive person can trigger to anger based on some slight to pride, and I notice that some cultures and families seem to teach an angry response to slights of pride.  I do respect established customs, because long custom is always assumed to have some positive value.  Thus I do not ever advise anyone to swallow their pride -- why?  Because it is up to them to decide whether that is the proper thing to do, I do not know another person's inner mind, nor their life history.      But I do know that no one, ever, operated themselves safely while under the influence of the brutal and sudden fires of Anger.  Thus I teach how to calm that fire first.  How to cause one's body to automatically relax, so that one's mind and spirit can then re-assert rational control.|`|5EfJu34taa	i leave the scene immediately & go to shop or just hang out in my favourite shop.it feels great.i even forget everything after that.|`|AA10531094	Swallow your pride and walk away!

That is why us guy's have to pay the dating tax(subsidizing women's entertainment), the marriage tax(losing control over our incomes-reason why women control well over 60-70% of the consumer market),divorce tax(after a divorce the husband is penalized irregardless if he did wrong or not and forced into indentured servitude to subsidize his ex) and the war tax(conscription of young men when feminist society decides to go to war for one reason or another).<br>  <br>   Ignore the man haters and self man hating bigot's.

Women's rights from the 1960's were primarily concerned with equal pay for equal work.  Until that time a woman and man may do the exact same work but the man would be paid 40 - 60% more because it was assumed that he had a family to support.  This was an unfair practice.

J'ai même demandé le lendemain si on m'avais bordé. C'était chez ma grand mère. Dans la maison mon papi est mort. D'ailleurs je crois que c'était dans ce même lit qu'il est mort.

They need to know who they are!|`|sP8KrvA7aa	I think what you're speaking of applies mostly about girls in their late teens or early twenties. Not children, but not quite women yet either.  So they don't truly know who they are or what they want. And when they find someone remotely special, they hang onto him for .. well, guidance, probably thinking that whatever he does or says is right. That eventually leads to those girls changing for their partners, regardless of whether their partner deserves that kind of compliment or not.  Anyway, in general women do not allow men to control their personalities. Weak/lost/confused females do.|`|ksBgpDRPaa	In my opinion, i think they like the fact that they have someone that loves (or likes) them in a manner that friends and families don't.

kvMnJ1AYaa	Bueno, hay que empezar por el principio, las constructoras pedían créditos enormes a los banco para edificar, a cambio los bancos pedian un rendimiento de ventas especifico "que vendieran tantos pisos en tanto tiempo" y para eso, las constructoras tenian un acuerdo para comprarse pisos entre ellas, asi el banco estaba satisfecho con el proyecto.<br>  <br>  el problema viene cuando nadie compra pisos, por que las constructoras se pueden comprar pisos entre ellas eternamente, pero hay que pagar nominas, licencias, materiales, etc esto provoca que a partir de finales de 2007 varias constructoras presentaran suspensiones de pago, quiebras, esto deja a un monton de oficinistas y sobre todo obreros en la calle.<br>  <br>  el problema es que esto es como un castillo de naipes, detras de uno cae otro, por el tema de comprarse los pisos entre ellos para mantener el movimiento de dinero, si quiebra la constructora con la que tu tenias el acuerdo para comprarle y venderle pisos, tu te quedas sin nadie que te pague esos pisos, y nadie a quien venderselo, no hay movimiento de capital, no hay rendimiento de ventas, y el banco empieza el embargo de propiedades, se queda sin dinero, y presenta quiebra.<br>  <br>  el problema viene ahora, hay 500.000 parados, la mayoria procedentes del sector de la construccion, ten en cuanta que los obreros normalmente no tienen ni carreras ni fp "y a veces ni el graduado escolar", y al no tener ningun tipo de conocimiento laboral fuera de la construccion se hace muy ficicil su recolocacion "es decir que no consiguen trabajo" y permanecen en paro consumiendo las arcas del estado "dinero publico".<br>  <br>  mas problemas, los bancos enbargan edificios enteros de las constructoras, pero el banco trabaja con dinero no con pisos, y como nadie compra pisos el banco no obtiene dinero del enbargo, el banco se queda sin capital y quiebra.<br>  lo peor es que de forma habitual los bancos se hacen creditos entre ellos "muuuy grandes" y si uno de los bancos quiebra ya no devuelve el dinero, lo que genera una perdida muy grande al banco que presto el dinero, si esto pasa con 2 o 3 bancos que quiebran el banco que dio el dinero quiebra tambien "ten en cuenta que en este caso hablamos de un banco grande" el cual a su vez tambien tenia creditos con otros bancos que tambien pierden el dinero prestado.<br>  esto crea una situacion de desconfianza entre los bancos que hace que no se presten dinero, lo que provoca que los bancos peque?os no puedan hacer prestamos "no tan livianamente como antes" lo que provoca que en un momento dado estos bancos también se queden sin dinero.<br>  <br>  ese grupo de problemas se denominan crisis.|`|UzNj1lwnaa	jajajajaa q respuestas tan tontas pero bueno.,<br>  <br>  no te preocupes yo tengo 17 <br>  y casi no se del tema<br>  pero se que hay crisis porque Estados Unidos se pasaron de creditos<br>  osea al sacar muchas cosas a credito ese dinero ficticio genera intereses reales, y al no haver recursos (dinero) para pagar esos intereses pues los bancos empiezan a quebrar y asi empieza la llamada crisis economica.<br>  <br>  es muy similar a lo que paso aqui en Mexico y por eso hizieron segun eso el fobaproa (fondo bancario de proteccion al ahorro) para que no <br>  pasara lo mismo, osea sacan muchas cosas a credito o piden prestamos execivos y como no hay para pagar se utiliza el dinero de los otros.<br>  <br>  en fin es algo muy pero muy tedioso amiga<br>  lo mejor es no sacar nada a credito <br>  y siempre ahorrar.<br>  <br>  =)<br>  <br>  bueno espero que te sirva de algo,<br>  <br>  au revoir.|`|bDeKm2tCaa	Imaginate que eres un banco.

9XAf7jxaaa	Stop feeling insecure.  Insecurity is the main cause of shyness.  You'd be surprised at how much differently things go if you believe in yourself.  I'm serious.  Remember that everyone is human and that no one is perfect and therefore everyone doubts him/herself occasionally.  It helps to think that everyone is created equally and that while you are different from everyone else, no one truly has anymore or less than you.  I guarantee that even the people who seem to be the most talented have some flaws that they manage to get over.  So accept that you are not perfect, and that no one else is.  People won't be quite as judgmental as you think.  Just appreciate your unique qualities, and see where they take you.  Talk to someone once in awhile, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  Pick up a hobby that puts your talents to the best of their use.  This will help your self-image.  Carry yourself with confidence, and if you love yourself, people will love you for you.  Remember to be yourself because that is what people are truly after.  Good luck!|`|Kl4kv5khaa	I am not sure although I have done it. Have you noticed what type of people you are around when you feel most shy? Then come up with ideas to break the ice.|`|14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	Shyness?  Do you mean a fear of people, some people, or a fear of strangers, or you do not like people because they make you uncomfortable?    The problem is help that is offered is often depending on the terms used in soliciting help and what terms generate within people.    To me shyness means a reluctance to put oneself forward among people and a reluctance to participate in events where people "expect" you to participate.    The question is this:  What is it you are afraid will happen if you are not shy [or do not withhold yourself from others]?  If you can allow yourself to discover this, your shyness will disappear.    Most often what is hidden within oneself that causes one to be shy, or reserved to the point it is obvious is something ones MIND believes regarding oneself that is not true, but since ones MIND believes it to  be true, ones MIND is simply protecting you... it believes.    Something one heard, or something a parent said often, or something one assumed by something a parent or significant other did was taken to "heart" and ones MIND protects you by causing you to be cautious so that what you fear might happen won't happen.    Without more verbalization from you, I can't guess.    Peace|`|5pioWG30aa	Honestly, I am still shy. I don't socialize much. But I try to talk to people at work, and I have a type of job that requires interaction with customers.  I was very shy as a teen, and I got over it by joining the US Army. The Army forced me to come out of my shell.      Today, I tend to have two personalities. One steps out and takes charge. The other likes to keep to myself.|`|iuBt8Re5aa	talk to everyone!    I'm not kidding, it really helps. I know there is loads of docs and guys telling you to find the reason why you are shy. instead of that just go out and start chatting with loads of people even if you have nothing to chat with them. And travelling really helps..
KrdOKdJcaa	You are afraid of making a mistake in front of a lot of people. To overcome this, memorize what you are going to say. Practice it over and over in the mirror until it is second nature. It will take a few times before you can fully overcome this. Fear of public speaking is THE most common fear, and it is also fully curable! Good luck!|`|xkD8z2hJaa	First practice in front of a mirror. If this doesn't help practice saying it to a Friend|`|iuBt8Re5aa	you just have to keep gettig n front of people and talk, and if you discuss your idea to a group of people(your closer friends) then you will have a group of supporters or a group of people who already know what you are talking about; you would be a lot more relaxed..    Other than that you should really know what you are going to talk about, I mean don't really copy the whole speach to your head, just understanding the subject is the most important thing here.    so; 1) you really know what you are talking about  2) you have at least some positive support from the crowd  3) you need practice  these are the fundamental things that really help you speak in front of people..    I think most of the people have the same issue and there is no easy way around it other than to be a little embarrased in front of the crowd.    ah one last thing, embarass yourself in front of people so you won't be scared to be embarassed during your speech|`|v6mQzSSbaa	Pretend your reading it to yourself.|`|X40Ww89qaa	just imagine you are naked and they are all watching|`|j9SP0xLcaa	Hm, start by speaking to your teacher or someone.

Yv52TEt9aa	You're not depressed, at least not clinically. You're now where near what it takes to be diagnosed with depression. Clinical depression doesn't disappear in 30 minutes when your friends come around.    You're not depressed, likely just moody. You wouldn't be pubescent, would you? Its a side effect, moodiness. Hormones affect mood regulation, if your hormones are increased or erratic its reasonable to expect instability in your mood.    Boredom is a son a b*ich, if you think its boredom, get up and do something. Stimulate yourself, read a book, go do something physically challenging, whatever, and if your mood still sucks, well then you can probably rule out boredom.|`|	I'm like that too! The weekends are so boring for me, and I'm gloomy especially in the first part of the day. Haha I mentioned this in my question|`|	If you really were depressed, you'd know it. Why did you ask this question twice?|`|	Because you are a person that likes people.  There are different type of people.  Some people are loner, they like to be along.

Find hobbies..    You will be fine.. make it through life and i promise you will succeed in anything you do|`|ksBgpDRPaa	Depending on how old you were, i would think about leaving home.  The apparent lack of care would probably just add to the stress and the thoughts.  try talking to a professional, they could probably help you more than me!  But yes, trying to get into a happier enviroment would probably do wonders.  Please don't act on these thoughts though, as no matter what your family say, i'm sure they would not want anything like that to happen.  Neither would anyone else who cares for you!|`|PQ21qz9Xaa	Don't kill yourself. Call a suicide hot line, they will give you more reasons to stay alive than anyone on here can!

Let them know your feelings and thoughts of depression, despair and suicide.  Please have them accompany you to the closest emergency room. If not then go yourself.  The ER staff will be able to advise you and assist you in getting the help you need now.  As bad as you feel right now you must believe that "this too shall pass"  these times will get better.  Harming yourself is definatly not the answer. Prove your own family wrong!!!! You are worth it!!  PS...I just read your age.  you definatly can call a friend, tell them or their parents a teacher or in emergency call police but please get help.  These years are tough, get the help you need.  Self harm isn't the answer.

rx2wMdlcaa	For love.  Love is a driving force in everyone's lives.  If your dead, you can't experience loving people anymore.  It is true that life holds great pains, but it also has great triumphs and moments that make life worth while.  So instead of getting up in the morning saying "here we go, just another day" say "what a great day to do something positive"  try and find something that makes you happy or someone to love and love you back.|`|eFuU8CuRaa	I sometimes think of this when I really think about what this whole life thing is.  We get up go to work/school come home and do it all over again.  What is it for?? I don't think anyone can answer that for anyone and that is what is so frustrating and different about it.  Us humans always want the answers to everything but for this one we TRULY must figure out for ourselves.  When you start to feel this way just do anything that makes life have some color to it.  Seriously you live once so do what you want to, whether it be going on a vacation or just chillen back in your house and watching the best movies you want.  Go out with some friends/family and get wasted.  Whatever it is you enjoy go out and enjoy it!!!  I know it is easier said than done but when life starts to get me down I know the only thing I can do is to just do it.  Power of thought.

Even if it's one person, have someone close to you.<br>  <br>  Excersize. It feels good.<br>  <br>  Get off the internet/tv.

Clearly, you are.  The only reason to do it is what else would you  be doing.  Spending too much time thinking about things you can't change, and after a long (or short) day at work, the issues are still there, and you can still think about them if you wish.  Who knows  the reason for life. It is a great mystery.  It is against nature to end a life, and I hope you'll find someone to talk to, and that you   won't do anything permanent...Good Luck=)  You're not alone|`|vY5HUrQPaa	You won't find the meaning through things, a career, entertainment, people, etc. They can't fill that vacuum in your heart. Life is only really meaningful and fruitful when it is lived for God. Man was made in His image for His pleasure and purpose, not man's. <br>  <br>  This is NOT religion, but about relationship, and it starts by recognizing that you, like all of us, have blown it by doing wrong, which displeases God. A relationship begins when you turn from wrong, believe on and confess Jesus Christ with your mouth, then you'll be saved from vain living. God will change you Himself from the inside out; your attempts to clean up yourself won't work.<br>  <br>  Jesus Christ died on the cross for our mess and to lead us into the right direction. With your obedience, He will begin to lead you into a more meaningful life. If you mean business with God, talk to Him and live by His Word (the Bible) everyday. Make friends at a local Bible-teaching church and  tell others what He's done for you.<br>  <br>  Jesus has freed me from alot of mental torment, aimlessness, frustration, and despair. He's promoted me in ways I never expected, and promised great things are yet to come. He can and will do the same for you if you trust Him.|`|BuPVkDT0aa	What kind of pain?  Physical, mental?  It is really important that you try to feel good.  You have the power to change anything because you are the one who chooses your thoughts and you are the one who feels your feelings.  Do you have someone to love?  A person,  a pet.  There is no greater power in the Universe than the power of love.   When you feel love, the great state of love, will bring goodness to your life.  And what a gift that is.  You matter.|`|8Apb5fXJaa	Reason. I am not sure. But I do know this. It is apparent that some are here to suffer and others rejoice. I have lived a full, fruitful, simple life. I have traveled the world, fallen in love and lust many times, and have never worried about materialistic property. I have worked hard and have found happiness in my journey not in what I expected to find at the end of the road. I hope you can find the same.|`|2d3337cd8ceb8e126b69b3b1d37a1ec1aa	Well the alternative is pretty damn boring.

Money was designed so you could get anything you wanted for a price so bartering became unnecessary.  If we went back to bartering, it would become the same thing, people hoarding things that people want and the like.<br>  <br>  |`|AA10700486	Pointless to complain about money, it's far far too important and useful to society to do without, which is why it will never go away. <br>  <br>  You should be more appreciative. Money serves as a motivator that allows society to organize its efforts and work together peacefully. In the absence of money some people will still wield great power, but they'd motivate others only by violence, slavery, murder, and force. <br>  <br>  In fact you are confusing money with power in your complaint. Long before there was money, there were great inequalities and abuses of power.<br>  <br>  Nowadays if you want somebody to do something for you, you can pay them money and they'll do it. In the old days you could still make people do things for you, but you'd have to hit them with a club or whip them til they scream or abduct them from their family. The only way to count on someone's labor being available for the long term was to enslave them. After all, there is a reason the concept of slavery emerged long before money was invented. And it took a long time, but eventually the advent of money put an end to slavery.<br>  <br>  |`|UKENIXvuaa	In one pacific island country, the currency used was big boulders.  In many countries in Asia, the medium of business before was barter.  Exchange of goods for another kind of goods.<br>  So, we cannot do away with some form of exchange media.  And the modern world has the convenient form of money, in small coins and in bills. <br>  Even the credit card is "money in some other form".  Financial transactions are being done in the internet on computers.<br>  90% of the wealth belongs to only 10% of the population.  This is true in any country.  Because, statistically, only 10% of the population has the initiative, the will, the determination and the guts to make himself and his loved ones better, in terms of property, money and other assets.   Even China is not an exemption.  The ideal community living is one that is a true communist - - only the govt has all the property and wealth of the country and takes care of its population.  But it has deviated a little bit from this and allowed capitalism in pockets, the economic zones.  And money is still the best tender in doing business.|`|Z4YzfrXnaa	well I agree with you money  sucks and most of what you say is true but the thing is money is there for a reason because if we didn't have money we would just use up all the earths resources and have anything we want without any consequences and soon enough the world would just stop turning so I guess in a way we need money because it's our last defense against basically being crooks|`|dYOoPWd7aa	well there was always some type off way off getting things.

Money also eases the flow of goods and services between the suppliers of said good or service and its consumers. If i was a supplier id rather be given money that i could go spend on anything that would improve my sales of burgers rather than be paid in shirts and have the hard time of finding somebody in the first palce to trade with and then hope they have somethign of value to me.<br>  |`|5Ho518J9aa	You could always work harder, learn a better skill, build a better mousetrap, etc. There is absolutely no point in dreaming about Communism, or trying to get the armchair liberal elite to go with you down the road to Socialist Park. Go figure out how to make money and you won't be so unhappy. No insult, it's just that noone ever seems to look at communist nations of the past or present when they suggest a more equitable distribution of funds. You want some of my pie? Go bake one yourself, noone handed it to me either, yet mine is delicious. As a kid, my brothers and sisters and me went really hungry, really often, yet we all wound up quite well.

RC2aQBkgaa	Don't worry much about it. Art is fun. Art is where you get to express yourself, good or bad. You probably just want to be perfect, but being yourself is all part of art! Keep practicing and don't be so tense. Just be free and happy and fun and draw/paint/whatever your heart out! Maybe if you can't really do that, art just isn't your thing. But if you are in school, you just need to not worry about it and do your best. Art shouldn't be about how good you are, it is about expressing yourself and being creative. As long as you think you've accomplished that, you are fine!|`|KThkZPrSaa	i feel that way to when im doing art. it feels like you just want to see it finished. the best advice i can give is that when you feel as if you are going to fast, just walk away from it for awhile. get that energy out and then go back to it. then concentrate on one tiny piece at a time.|`|Pq1fVyMoaa	Try taking breaks while completing a piece of art.  It can be anything from a few hours to a few weeks.  Not only does this refresh your mind, but it can also provide you with new ideas or sources of inspiration.  Also, focus on what caused you to begin your piece of art in the first place - make sure that it provides a powerful drive to finish to piece.  Remember that your motivation will be (in addition to enjoyment) the final result.    Many artists spend years on a single painting, so don't feel the need to rush through!  Good luck!|`|dNbx41afaa	I feel like I have that same problem.  I truly love and enjoy all types of art and making something from nothing.  What I suggest for you and I hope you take this into consideration, is to look into not just drawing and painting, but other types of art.  Use your energy into creating something from photography, sculpture, graphic design, lithography, sewing and needlepoint, and so many others.  You'll find that because you have the talent for art, you'll be very good at many if not all different types of art and you can broaden your interests.  A lot of times, also, I use the canvas as an outlet for my emotions, and all of the stress of feeling like I'm not being patient enough or taking my time on something just goes away.  You have to really find your passion.  Who knows, maybe your just looking at art the wrong way and you feel like its work.  Try another form of art, and you'll see what best fits you.

fSu5c3l1aa	In most cases yes.  Healthy food comprises of HEALTHY NUTRIENTS, and to keep any edible product healthy and nutritionally rich, requires  lots of efforts and pains.  It is important and difficult to add nutritional value to a products, given the supply contraints and the Cost Factor.  Adding essence, artificial flavours is easy and economical.  But maintaining the original nutritional value is a tedious process.  Hence Healthy Foods tend  to be expensive.    Junk Food is not always cheap. But they are un-healthy. Going for an un-healthy expensive food is like playing with a Double-Edged Sword.  |`|AA11604491	Good question.  I think there are a few reasons.    The author of the book, "The Omnivore's Dilemma," contends that junk food is made or processed from crops that are heavily subsidized by the government mainly corn.  The subsidies make corn cheap, so corn and its derivatives get used to produce the junk food as cheaply as possible.  For example, most soda companies switched from cane sugar to corn syrup to sweeten their beverages because of the costs.  The book's author contends that there are 10 or 12 corn products in a chicken McNugget.      Carrying this further, if corn and wheat are heavily subsidized, and other crops aren't, the subsidized crops have crowded out production of other crops, making these crops more expensive.     Finally, there are other basic factors.  Junk food has a long shelf-life, so there's less spoilage, and junk food is more durable.  Fresh, nutritious foods spoil quicker and are more easily damaged in handling, so the end prices reflect the higher costs of spoilage and damage.  Junk food can be transported on standard trucks, where fresh food typically needs to be refrigerated in transit, so the transportation costs are higher.  |`|I13rHn1Waa	cozzz in collaborating healthy food, a lot of effort is required but in making the junk food, the things required r not having any nutritious value....  |`|AA12235964	because GIGO  lol  because junk is simply made to taste good not for healthy body.

I'm also more budget conscious... rather than paying $6 for lunch each day, I brown-bag it for about $.75 each day.  Rather than paying $3.50 for a cup of coffee at a retail chain, I brew a large cup in the morning - at about $.20 per cup (I like it black). Rather than buying pre-prepared meals, I buy the mixings and make it all by hand - almost from scratch.  That's usually a savings of 60% or more - usually closer to 90%.    Why drive a mile, when I can walk it?  Do I REALLY need the new shoes or can I make due for another couple months... or are they really just a "wanna" buy that can be avoided?
e61f3cd63ab0b4ff68273bef3852330caa	Credo che tu susciti inviadia nelle tue coetanee... normale. Le donne, in alcune cose, soprattutto nella sfera affettiva, sono molto pi competitive degli uomini. E quando subentra l'invidia di una donna son dolori...Tu hai l'amicizia dei maschi e questo  un bene perch, alla tua et, secondo me, i ragazzi hanno un modo di divertirsi pi spontaneo e meno stereotipato di quello di molte ragazze. E' per senz'altro vero che non puoi vivere appieno le tue esperienze coi ragazzi. L'amicizia uomo-uomo o donna-donna offre una complicit e una comprensione che  pi difficile da raggiungere in un rapporto (non intimo) cross-sex.  L'unico modo  quello di conoscere una ragazza con pochi complessi ( pi facile trovare un ago in un pagliaio) che non si senta in soggezione n per la tua bellezza n tantomeno per la tua intelligenza.

Para comenzar cada pais tiene leyes, cdigos, penales, civiles, del trabajo, etc. etc. y los legisladores han puesto ah lo que consideran justo, lo que a opinin de los detractores del rgimen (la "oposicin") no es siempre tan justo.    En un concepto muuuuuy amplio podra considerarse justa la ley pareja (ley pareja no es dura), la misma ley para todos, sin favorecer a nadie. Pero eso tampoco lo es. Por ejemplo se favorece en algunos paises con repajas de impuestos a los que construyen viviendad nuevas, es un incentivo para que se de auge a la construccin, y haya ms trabajo. Pero no es tan pareja, pues hay otras actividades que no tienen ese privilegio, y as suma y contina.   Difcil es explicar que las leyes divinas son justas, hay ateos y creyentes que opinan que no es justo que muera un recin nacido, por ejemplo. Pero si ampliamos el horizonte y le agregamos cosas que las iglesias por autoconveniencia no ense?an, como la reencarnacin y la ley del karma, entonces llegaremos a comprender un poco ms de esa aparente injusticia que no es nada de injusta. De ah el dicho: "Dios castiga pero no con palos ni con piedras".

gC2VFxvDaa	Men and women are different, at least in Western society (western hemisphere and Europe), in that men are in power and therefore define women, what they can be and do, etc. Women don't have very many "straight" things they can do in the face of men being in charge. So they go crooked...they become neurotic, they turn to alcohol or drugs, etc. Or they may "strike back" at men who make them feel badly by doing and saying things that does the same to their men. That is, they attack them (usually passive-aggressively) to hurt them in some way as they themselves have felt hurt. Often this will happen as the result of early childhood and a negative relationship with Daddy, which is carried over into adult relationships with men. I suspect that few women who have had a good/positive relationship with their father will seek to (as you put it) "destroy their mate's ego."    Some women attack their own male partners as a way to reduce them in some way, because they have an exaggerated idea of their own father left over from childhood. They are trying to make sure that no man can ever live up to the ideal image they have of their father. (Thus they put their own partner into competition with their childhood father, and in such a thing, the present-day partner can never win.)|`|6wUojgSRaa	u guys are evil,,, and i guess thats how u feel u control us!! ;lol|`|69f80b1e2ce9fe9e8eb99eb4c5fc5889aa	 usually i find someone in a couple is the dominate one and usually   as a woman goes she only has that to fight back with because the   husband is a total jerk or extremely boring or something and when  the man does it i notice that the ones i have seen the man was an  alcoholic recovered or still and he has to be dominant and make the  woman feel bad so he can be superior.. dumb huh how relationships  go... that is just my theory.|`|AA10096193	because women are manipulative and like to play games -- with men, with each other. thank god i'm gay.|`|q57kvNxhaa	Mostly because men tend to live through their ego's, and by keeping them in check with subtle comments and stern opinions, he'll think twice about acting like a testosterone-ridden bull.|`|2K8HxLcWaa	They're telling you to do it to them!

2ZYZr0sJaa	Every day, whether we're pushing for a raise, wrestling with the kids over homework, or judging whether a friend really likes our latest redecorating spree, we're reading each other's minds. Drawing on our observations, our databank of memories, our powers of reason, and our wellsprings of emotion, we constantly make educated guesses about what another person is thinking and feeling. Throughout the most heated argument or the most lighthearted chat, we're intently collecting clues to what's on the other person's mind at the moment.    Mind reading of this sortnot to be confused with the infallible superhero kind of telepathyis a critical human skill. It's the way we make sense of other people's behavior and decide on our own next moves. Mind reading enables us to negotiate, compete, cooperate, and achieve emotional closeness with others. It lets us figure out when we're being manipulated or seduced. It's how we know when someone finds our jokes hilarious or is humoring us out of politeness. Mind-reading ability is perhaps the most urgent element of social intelligence.    Cognitive distortions are inaccurate thoughts or ideas identified in cognitive therapy and its variants, which maintain negative thinking and help to maintain negative emotions. Eliminating these distortions and negative thought is said to improve mood and discourage maladies such as depression and chronic anxiety. The process of learning to refute these distortions is called "cognitive restructuring".|`|YgHxMF4Uaa	what's in a name?    Might be none, one beeing the early stage of the other one

To every thing there is a season   a time to every purpose under the heaven:  A time to be born  a time to die  a time to plant  a time to pluck up that which is planted;  A time to kill,   a time to heal;   a time to break down,   and a time to build up;  A time to weep,   a time to laugh;   a time to mourn,   and a time to dance;  a time to cast away stones,   a time to gather stones together;   a time to embrace,   a time to refrain from embracing;  A time to get,   a time to lose;   a time to keep, and a time to cast away;  A time to rend,   and a time to sew;   a time to keep silence,   and a time to speak;  A time to love,   and a time to hate;   a time of war,   and a time of peace.|`|76fYDbsCaa	5, almost same thing as Henry.

rBmMVhgNaa	No creo que sea un medio de control. Afortunadamente vivimos en un pas libre y tu puedes decidir que hacer con tu vida, incluyendo la decisin de formar o no una familia.  Lo que ocurre es que el ser humano llega a un punto en su vida donde identifica su necesidad de vivir en pareja y eventualmente procrear hijos, de tal manera que eso lo hace sentirse pleno.

It's around this time where you get more in touch with your subconscious and a more serious side to yourself.     For dating, pick a girl and think deeply about you and her in a relationship. Do this everytime you wake up or brush your teeth or while doing your homework, anything's fine really. Imagine the happy relationship that you have with her. For this to work, you have to believe it works. When the time comes for you to make that first step then step up. You don't have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step. Do this with your grades also. Imagine A's on tests, report cards, homework, etc. Focus on those 2 things, believe it will happen, and they will come to you.|`|bca97031b8342625d37375fa2fb4f6a4aa	maybe you could have a party or ask some mates or girl mates to go to the movies together, your'e feeling lonely thats why you feel like this, get out more with your school mates or head down to the beach in summer, its a great place to hang out... just ask them you may be suprised by your actions. and the responses you get.. stay positive things will work out....|`|AA11966875	Pick a few really good friends out of the "quite a few friends" - boys and girls.  Really talk.  Find out who you are.  Help them find out who they are.  Remind yourself that you have plenty of time for a "girlfriend" later, when you feel better about things, and not so lousy that you'll pull her down (another reason for a few good friends, instead of just one - you don't want to put all your troubles on one, but you don't want to share your troubles with all those other friends).  Looking nice is cool, but watch that budget.  Having a good friend to share with and grow with helps you feel better in a lot of areas, work and school included.  - my 2 cents|`|qq0c6dTRaa	Just smile and start conversations with girls like if your on the bus and just show interest in their lives or whatever there saying. trust me, I am a girl who is in 7th grade. Lots of boys talk to me and that really makes me think good about them. They wont go like EW! or pinch you or something, we are not that catty!!!!!They will start to think of you as a really likeable person. Just believ in yourself in everthing and think of all the good things about you when your feeling lousy. And for your grades, just try to study even like 15 minutes and just do all your homework. I am on honor role and I know it works. Even if its like 5 minutes of studying, it still is an improvement from not studying at all. Try to make work social and funny by talking and making jokes about something stupid about work or your boss. (haha) trust me, when you take this advice, you wont need another pointless outfit (I know I love clothes too

The four plus years he drank were pure hell but I stuck it out and I learned a lot about myself.  He's sober now and things are good but I think the drinking years were important in helping me grow up.

rBmMVhgNaa	Podras empezar leyendo un libro de historia de Mxico. Te dars cuenta de la grandeza de nuestras culturas prehispanicas (maya, olmeca, tolteca, azteca) en cuanto al grado de desarrollo alcanzado en su arquitectura, artes, ciencias e inclusive literatura. Eso es un gran motivo para sentirse orgulloso de ser mexicano, porque hoy en dia todo lo anterior es admirado y reconocido a nivel mundial.   Otra parte interesante de la historia reciente de Mexico es lo que este pas ha aportado artsticamente hablando. Tenemos grandes pintores con obras de primer nivel (Diego Rivera, Rufino Tamayo, David Siqueiros, Clemente Orozco), escritores reconocidos mundialmente (Octavio Paz, Carlos Fuentes,  Jos Emilio Pacheco), en fin, la lista sera interminable. Tenemos una gastronoma muy rica en variedades y sabores como pocas en el mundo, esto es muy digno de presumir. El territorio mexicano tiene maravillas naturales inigualables y una gran diversidad en flora y fauna que hacen de este pas una joya para el viajero que nos visita.   Pero lo mas grandioso de este pas sin duda es su gente: luchadora, comprometida, sensible, solidaria, confiable y amistosa.  Como puedes ver, hay muchos motivos para sentirte orgullosa de tener tus races en Mexico. Por circunstancias de tu vida, no has tenido la oportunidad de conocerlo mejor, pero nunca es tarde. Infrmate, lee, viaja si tienes oportunidad al centro y sur del pas y quedars convencida de lo que te digo, y con esa misma pasin con la que yo hablo de Mxico (porque yo amo este pas deveras), transmtelo a tu gente para que sepan que Mxico ciertamante tiene muchos problemas, pero tambin tiene una cara amable y muy disfrutable.  No te encasilles con la imagen que la TV transmite de Mxico. Date la oportunidad de conocerlo por ti misma. Te sentirs orgullosa. Te lo aseguro.|`|Kbbxw2UKaa	Mira, en primer lugar, el sentirte orgullosa de ser mexicano (a) no se trata de aprender algo, que alguin te de "clases de como amar a Mxico" nada que ver simplemente lo sientes y ya. sabes cul es el problema? que hay mucha gente como tu que siente que vivir en E.U es lo mximo y que hablar ingls es nice, te abre muchas puertas, claro, porque es una forma de comunicarte, pero ni al caso eso que dices de sentir vergenza o sentirse menos, el problema es de ellos que estn acostumbrados a que todo mundo les bese los pies que porque son gringos y ven a todo mundo por encima del hombro, vienen aqu y si bien buena onda y todo, porque no es su tierra, pero vas a all y te quieren humillar.            No digo que Mxico sea perfecto, porque est muy lejos de serlo, problemas polticos, econmicos, corrupcin y todo lo que tu quieras, pero la gente es hermosa, y sus raices excepcionales. Lstima que ya no vives aqu. Tu problema es que ya no perteces aqu, y ya ests como la Hindia Mara, "ni de aqu ni de all".|`|dAs1Q95qaa	nse|`|VS6Npl7Faa	A mi me da vergenza ser mexicano, porque la mayora de los mexicanos tal parece que solo les interesa el descanso, el sexo y comer, son peor que los animales porque al menos ellos no tienen consciencia.  Por eso Mxico esta como esta, los mexicanos no se preocupan por el desarrollo cultural entre otros aspectos positivos.  !!!Me averguenzo de ser Mxico??? pero no por eso voy a ser como los mexicanos.|`|722d6143620f4932c5febf66e173ad7eaa	Yo estoy orgulloso no solo por ser mexicano sino porque cada dia mas de nosotros estamos dejando una gran huella en todo el mundo, y te voy a mencionar unos cuantos mexicanos para que te sientas orgullosa.    Rafael Marquez, juega en el Barcelona de Espa?a  Adrian Fernandez Piloto de autos  Javier aguirre Dirigue el equipo Athletico de Madrid  Lorena Ochoa campeona de Golf  El due?o de los celulares es uno de los mas ricos del mundo y es mexicano  Carlos Salcido Capitan del PSV de Holanda  Eugenio Derbez actor  Thalia Empresaria, cantante y actriz  Ana Guevara gana medalla de Plata en los olympicos    Todos ellos son conocidos mundial mente por haber ganado algo    por eso son un orgullo mexicano y hay mas mexicanos rompiendo la mala imagen del mexicano    huevon y le estan hechando ganas, ya las cosas no son como antes.|`|fd09a08fac5b37b6705b1ca9c26c8e14aa	Tu pregunta es muy complicada, por que estas fuera de Mxico, y solo tienes informacin actualizada, pero Mxico es mucho mas que lo  que dicen los peridicos y los noticieros en la TV, no comentas si te gusta leer pero pienso que seria una manera de acercarte a la cultura de Mxico desde otra perspectiva. Te recomiendo que consigas libros de de Velazco Pi?a como la mujer dormida debe dar a luz, o el camino a Aztlan no recuerdo el autor, y te podrs reencontrar con tu cultura que es de verdad digna de adoracin.

If you had your back flat against the sphere, you would be see yourself upside-down. If you were closer to the mirror (facing it and in front of the focal point), I think your image turns right-side up again. As cool as being inside a sphere with mirror walls sounds, I think I would go bonkers. :)
cE4g1Lmgaa	Friend, I used to be just like you in my school days.  I felt that everyone was watching me even though nobody cared to look towards me - always so self-conscious.    When I grew up, I was a very reserved person until I got some friends around, who kept dragging me to the public and just let me stand there unattended.  Then I practiced a few things, like:  before leaving home, I would check myself full top to bottom in front of the mirror to see that I am not awkward in any way.  To fix my eyes, I would normally look up at the ceiling (some blind spot up above) or if it is below, it would be slightly below the eye level - so that I avoid straight eye-contact, but am looking at the person opposite - not staring into the eyes.  So, I shift my eyes just getting occasional eye-contact and move away casually.  This becomes a practice, I don't have to bother much about how I look or where I look - then I can just focus on what I am talking or what I am doing.  In fact, I have become a lot naughty and I observe more things more keenly than any normal person these days.  You too will get over this very soon, my friend.    Yes, there were some friends who prayed for me to overcome this and that helped a lot.  I will pray for you now, so God will surely help you come out of the problem like I came out of it.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	One thing to keep in mind though, in most situations where you feel everyone is noticing your faults...they are probably scrutinizing their own. Think about something or find people to talk to...ask them questions, get them to do the talking. Then you can be sure they are thinking about other things than you.|`|1dzzgaGZaa	you're too conscious of yourself, just relax and think about the other person, about what you're talking about or what the surroundings are like. take the focus off yourself and you'll be fine.|`|AA11114273	When in doubt, emulate James Bond.  (Not that sissy brosnan bond, daniel craig bond...)    Or just try putting your hand in your pockets.  
HfrMuq5oaa	Stomach  To see your own stomach in your dream, suggests the beginning of new changes in your life. The dream may highlight your difficulties with accepting these changes. It is also indicative of how you can no longer tolerate or put up with a particular situation, relationship, or person. The stomach is often seen as the center of emotions    Ambulance  To see an ambulance in your dream, indicates that your careless activities and indiscretion may lead to major problems and complications. This dream may also stem from your own fears of declining health or that you have contracted a disease. Alternatively, it suggests that you need to stop and pay close attention to some waking situation.    Police  To see the police in your dream, indicates some failure to perform or to honor obligations and commitments. The police also symbolize structure, rules, and control. A more direct interpretation of seeing the police in your dream forewarns that you should avoid reckless behavior.      Die  To dream that you die in your dream, symbolizes inner changes, transformation, self-discovery and positive development that is happening within you or in your life. Although such a dreams may bring about feelings of fear and anxiety, it is no cause for alarm and is often considered a positive symbol.  Dreams of experiencing your own death usually means that big changes are ahead for you. You are moving on to new beginnings and leaving the past behind. These changes does not necessarily imply a negative turn of events. Metaphorically, dying can be seen as an end or a termination to your old ways and habits. So, dying does not always mean a physical death, but an ending of something.     To see a nurse in your dream, denotes that you need to be taken care of and a time of healing, either mentally, physically or spiritually.    Sounds like a pretty drastic psyche renewal that you are undergoing. Hope it goes well.|`|898f20a257695abc9115e62cda6828e3aa	You probably ate something either spicy or with a lot of sauce and had bad indigestion.  You were asleep and didn't know you were having horrible heartburn, so your mind (in dream state) created a scenario that involved pain in your chest.
WSvq2r26aa	This has actually happened to me. And, when she first told me, I was shocked. She had hid this huge secret from me. But I felt for her. I told her that I was always here for her, and now she calls me whenever she hits a new low, instead of self-harming. I'm so glad she told me, I could never have lived with myself if something drastic had happened to her and she had never told me.     But don't be upset with your friend if they at first don't know what to say. Give them some time, this may be completely new and shocking for them. But they will eventually come around, and want to help you.     Best of luck in your recovery process, and telling your best friend.|`|OWKJTU6kaa	i would run to her and hug her and make sure shes ok because I love my best friend she is like my sister|`|2g54cAwpaa	Megan, it is good that you are getting some help.

phJC77pWaa	It is a difficult situation to be in right now, but it takes someone who has the will to persevere to thrive in these tough times. Your friend knows what to do because she has been able to help others. What she has to do is look at herself in the third person, tell herself what would she do if she had to give herself advice.  Make sure your friend knows that she has support for whatever decision she makes to stay confident and not fall in a mental gutter.  I hope this will help your situation, good luck.|`|9ea5e8dd576fe0621bb8f8f8c17c8e7baa	Hi Amy C,     Its great that you are looking for ways to cheer her up.
