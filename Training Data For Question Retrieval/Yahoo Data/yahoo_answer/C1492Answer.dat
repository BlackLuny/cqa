MRGZCh0vaa	Haha, thats funny. I love coincidences like like that!|`|qMCHLrKCaa	Although the Rev. Mr. Bayes, who developed Bayesian probability analysis, was an ordained minister of the Church of England, I think this belongs more in a section on science and mathematics than Religion and Spirituality (unless you're trying to make the point that G-d has a really weird sense of humor, which might be a good thing).<br>  <br>  Grace be unto you and peace.|`|fM7yNf8oaa	What does this have to do with religion and spirituality?|`|Qc6MqcpWaa	And you felt the need to let this be known why?<br>  <br>  This does not belong in R&S.|`|iRXQFr5Laa	I guess it's a small world after all huh?|`|r8rykCkGaa	I think that has to do with something psychic going on.  My daughter in law is psychic and these kind of things go on with her.

kAfZaLwraa	That's a little bit much. It's kind of high-pressure, and it's that really long letter that you claim to be trying to avoid. I agree with the above poster. Ask her out for coffee. Leave the long-winded declarations of affection for after you two have more of a history. You don't need to "justify" or "explain" why you're telling her any of this, or why you like her, or how much you like her, or why you're writing instead of speaking. All of that makes you seem nervous, which will make her nervous. Your email should say something like this:<br>  <br>  "blahblahblahnormalstuff... Wanna grab coffee after youth group next week?"|`|a8HFTnCKaa	That was actually very well written. Your analogies are so clear and precise, unique even. Well done! I hope everything works out for you :)|`|Ieq0zzdeaa	The letter is not well drafted.  When we are writing to our beloved, we should be plain and straight and there should be no poetic language.|`|UxDXD6Liaa	that letter is really cute !<br>  i wish a guy can write that to me :'[|`|KPNOQAP4aa	i think it's really sweet that you want to handwrite her a letter, and i applaud your desire to be no pressure and that you express a desire to help her grow in God. <br>  <br>  as much as flowery writing is creative and expressive, however, it really should be saved for poetry! i started reading it and it was really distracting, no matter how much you excused it. i would suggest taking that out, or seriously refining it, because it's putting more emphasis on how you're saying it rather than what you're saying. <br>  <br>  also i would not keep looping your excuses back to yourself! yes you can use 'i' in your letter, but don't keep apologizing for how you are expressing yourself. that should be taken care of with the flowery stuff though. <br>  <br>  the easiest way to write an understandable letter is to say it out loud like you're actually telling it to the recipient. that way you can tell if it is too hard to follow or if it is easily understandable; chances are if you get lost saying it out loud she will get confused while reading it!<br>  <br>  hope that helps!|`|ylqUPqcpaa	awe.<br>  omg this is amazing.<br>  if i were that girl i would be in love with you after i read this.<br>  but im sure she will LOVE it and if she does not like it, well shes crazy.|`|9b959ce79253c06d59afb5fb0580d517aa	Forget the letter, just ask her out for coffee.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - Pepper.
yHYpesK6aa	There white gangs. you know, you can still call those cowboy bandits gangs. or the neo nazi supremacist stuff gangs. but, my theory is that, its because gangs grew out from colored people. to most colored race, its their culture. You know, like their old tribes, who fight for power and wealth. white people have kingdoms, coloreds have tribes. there are european tribes but not as much as the tribes brown, black, yellow[???] people have. You can see, the european's have gangs, but their formal. Like the Italian mafia, Irish Mafia, Russian Mafia and all that.|`|FxVRPIm3aa	There are all white gangs in prisons.<br>  They're usually white supremacist/neo-nazi types.

Each time you click the statement and go to the symbol, if you back-page you get yet another statement.  I went forwards and back over and over and it seems to word out a cryptic message of sorts.<br>  <br>  I went back and forth 19 times and gave up...the flashing really gets to you.  Perhaps simply stating that Hell is on a different plane of existence.

NmsBFeNJaa	Heaven and hell may exist and maybe some of the teachings of the bible can help you on your way to heaven; but for the most part it has caused people to judge and condemn their fellow man. Because of this, I believe many people have been wrongly convinced of their own righteousness. Perhaps if the bible did not exist then people would simply choose to love and accept their fellow men in this life which could secure their happiness in the hereafter.|`|NfSozW24aa	We don't get into Heaven by "following the Bible." That's impossible. We only get into Heaven by the grace of God. Trying to get into Heaven by obeying the law, any law, is impossible, and will lead to eternal death.<br>  <br>  Hell is eternal death, not eternal fire and torment. This conclusion is found when all verses on the subject are compared.<br>  <br>  familyradio.com|`|256t9bIqaa	Heaven and hell aren't the rewards of following or not following the bible.    The last time I looked my bible didn't have legs.<br>  <br>  Heaven and hell are the rewards of accepting or rejecting Jesus.|`|AA10394102	No.<br>  You should follow a religion because you believe in it.  Some religions focus more on the present then the afterlife, and that is what I intend to do.|`|DA53AFKhaa	nah i think heaven is not wanting anything, selflessness, so it would be hypocritical of me to think that way|`|q3KCDrMAaa	No. I am atheist. I think would would effect people's belief is if they could die once and come back.|`|e67045ea08edd6bf714e0243622a0defaa	Nope. :-)|`|f79674f11cb0d8833ea9b2f32ce01461aa	As an atheist, I don't believe in either...so no...no effect|`|AA10643080	Definitely.<br>  Learn from the words of Apostle Paul,<br>  <br>  For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Christ been raised:<br>  and if Christ hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.<br>  Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.<br>  If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.<br>   (I Cor 15:16-19)<br>  <br>  This is the reason why God had shown the heaven and hell in the visions of John.<br>  If there is nothing to hope for, then eveything is in vain.|`|7dHV8Ak6aa	No because once you feel the spirit inside you, you don't even look at the world anymore. You'll start to look up at the Orion belt and then fathom the greatness of space/life. God's power does something inside of you to where you stop and think about lust differently, you start to realize the battle of sin versus righteousness. It's unexplainable, before  I knew God i didn't care that i thought about sex a certain way, or life. Now I look at how men treat women with their eyes, i see the sin of man everyday. When you actually give it all to god, and i mean all. Your thoughts, you have to fast to really cleanse your mind, you don't even think the same way. It's a natural high peace you feel. And you really see how conditioned and stupid we are as people to worship men like actors and hollywood, and celebrities. This feeling is what keeps me from sin. It steers me away. That's the essence of God|`|TotgRmRZaa	the bible is a very important book.it sooths many people's minds.the gospels are very well written.<br>  st.paul's writings are profound because of the way he was chosen.we will be judged on not whether we followed the bible,but how we used our gift of free will.|`|iRXQFr5Laa	It's not exaclty about following the bible, it's about having a relationship with God. And I love God with all of my heart mostly because he died so i didn't have to go to hell.|`|VijKkTVuaa	Basically yes because you wouldn't have any incintive of doing good or evil.|`|3d97cedda0f936e37048a4e1d413a7f8aa	no, it won't. anyway, i'm following all His books.|`|ykcpQhWzaa	no|`|RoqxGbgRaa	actually, probably not.<br>  <br>  though heaven and hell are beliefs of mine, i actually practice Christianity because of my desire to have the presence and the wisdom of GOD in my life.  and i want to experience continual closeness with Him.<br>  <br>  furthermore, i am really touched by the sweet and gentle love GOD has for us, and His desire to be in relationship with us.|`|EVby6dGCaa	Well, I don't see those hypothetical rewards as meaningful anyway, since I'm convinced that with a loving God, hell makes no sense, unless it's some situation we do to ourselves. And then it's surely not permanent.<br>  <br>  It is useful to recall that in the time of the Israelites, there was not a belief in an afterlife in that culture (Yes, there certainly was in other cultures, but not in the Israelite culture). So their behavior was not motivated by the threat of heaven and hell. and they developed arguably one of the best theologies of all time, and then we Christians stole it and copied it.<br>  <br>  Why do good? Because it feels so good. Who needs a threat when doing good is its own reward? As well it should be!|`|AA10351261	That's kind of like saying that a touchdown in football isn't worth anything.  A team scores a touchdown but gets 0 for it? I don't think football players would be too enthused about playing football. It is the same way with your question but that doesn't mean I wouldn't believe in God. I'd still have Him to thank for the good things in life. He would still be worth our thanks and praise.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	i would still do good, because i also believe what goes around comes around, and if your punishment wasn't going to be hell, well then punishment will come from somewhere you least expect it|`|0hdo4WORaa	No ......

Turn the TV off, folks|`|LGvwl67waa	...Actually, Islam isn't a religion, but a complete way of life: religion, culture, economics, politics...<br>  <br>  Still, when Muslims are labeled as such for a crime, it is usually because the crime reflects something from Islam. Ex: suicide bombers & honor killings.<br>  <br>  When, say, a Muslim gang member stabs a member of a rival gang, the news will report it as a street crime.<br>  <br>  When a Muslim breaks the speed limit, no one claims it is because of his religion.<br>  <br>  And so on.|`|DSg4fgnEaa	There is a lot of misleading information going around about Muslims.  On top on 911 and government involvement thereof... People think they are either peaceful or follow a cult(not a religion) or a religion that confides in terror.  Using them as an example for not being able to distinguish between the two is most likely a mistake.  There are more factors involved then you think.  But yes.. the world has problems.|`|Q7WUTCUtaa	Muslim's have in the recent years, IN A MOST TERRIBLE WAR, committed the worst of sins (decapitations, amputations, live humans buried, executions of the most horrible kind, bombs going off in the most crowded (different  religious areas). What ever served the terrorist most horrendous desires. Is that a person (Muslim) acting badly? Thats hate of the worst kind. Thats not culture or religion!!!! Its Demonic!!! We should leave that war NOW. Send our brave troops home. Let those terrible creatures kill each other!!!!!! Those muslins, and they will proudly tell that they are MUSLIMS, want WAR, No peace. They say it everyday. Check the media.|`|Vy4jvBjDaa	Because people are racist, and now whenever they see a slight mistake made by a Muslim, it's always because of their religion.|`|nGyOmjPsaa	I know.

JK :)|`|E8pbdVPPaa	It depends on how "bad" something bad is! If a Muslim man hijacks an airplane and flies it into a skyscraper "In the name of god!" then that action is motivated by religion (delusions). If a Saudi Arabian woman drives a car to work (forbidden by her culture) then that action is culturally based. The answer is the Western world is ignorant to Muslim culture and beliefs.|`|XDcOhAALaa	It depends on the crime.<br>  <br>  Bombing a US embassy. Yes, probably motivated by religion. My friend served in afghanistan for 3 years and knows that muslim extremists are motivated to kill innocent people based on religion because they believe that they will earn a passage into their heaven. <br>  <br>  Burglary. Probably not motivated by religion.|`|XfUMGLrxaa	If a person doesn't want to be looked at in a religious light then they shouldn't proclaim their religion|`|gDVQNMR7aa	Oftentimes culture and religion go hand in hand, especially in Muslim countries.|`|31cc91292d4acf2ddc9a6d449e86868eaa	Religion = culture<br>  <br>  Radical Muslims who have waged war on the west declare their war just because they are "supposed to" persecute those who aren't Muslim. And when Radical Muslims fight amongst themselves (common in countries like Iraq with a split population) it is because they believe that the other sect of Islam (the two main denominations are Shi'te and Sunni) are inferior to theirs.|`|WdAuncq9aa	i love this question it is really good<br>  <br>  when jew kills 1500 kids AND WOMEN  in GAZA last month media call it  self defense <br>  <br>  when muslim kill i American inventor in iraq media call muslim terrorist<br>  <br>  YOU CAN MOCK MUSLIMS AND CHRISTAN BUT YOU CANNOT DO TO JEW OTHER WISE YOU LIVE WILL BE DIFFICULT|`|495e344229dc3bcc5dcbf3cd52fed97eaa	Excellent question.

Yes, I have I just ignore the person, as if I happen to show any signes of irratation, I just please their sadistic nature. Unless this gets physical, I suggest shrugging it off. I don't see any need for you to stoop to her level.|`|AA11627889	Yes, if you believe you did nothing to invite her to be so horrible (I don't know how you put up with it) then she does have an emotional problem. She's very insecure and something about you brought it out of her. Who knows what she's gone through in life to make her this way, but that really is disgusting how she acted. In this case I think it may have been something to do with you daring to fight back. She expected to make you a quivering mess but you rose above it and she would have panicked a bit.|`|aSTmFCiBaa	if you know that you do not invite hostility,,she has an emotional problem that you cannot solve,except to talk to the principal ,or supervisor|`|kAfZaLwraa	I suppose it's the same reason that you get angry when they treat you that way. Being mean is being mean. <br>  <br>  I suggest continuing to be polite. If she says something snarky, call her on it. Simply state that if she isn't going to make a suggestion on how you can improve, you'd appreciate it if she'd keep her comments to herself.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Always take the high road. It's not professional to take vengence. However, there was one photo editor who was a tyrant with the printer we shared. I did grab a bunch of his printouts and toss them in the women's washroom.<br>  Don't give her power over your emotions. Just accept they are feeling inadequate and handle themselves badly. It's more about them then it is about you.|`|9b959ce79253c06d59afb5fb0580d517aa	Good on you for standing up for yourself. <br>  <br>  She's a bully and she's treatedly you badly.

It IS illegal and a Human Resource's issue.  Bring it up with your manager (without her) and explain to him how her attitude isn't just affecting your professional reputation, but it's also affecting your work.  <br>  <br>  If he does not put a stop to Miss Attitude's attitude, bring it up with an even higher authority than him.<br>  <br>  Personal issues have no business being in a business setting.

It's a witnesses from the Ancient American continent that testifies that Jesus is the Christ and confirms from an independent source the testimonies and doctrines found in the Bible.|`|26Qb0cUjaa	Who the ****-on-toast wanted those AWFUL Star Wars prequels? ;_;<br>  <br>  Now kids growing up will associate Star Wars with some whiny kid and a lot of ballet-with-sticks instead of DARTH VADER and HAN FREEKIN' SOLO<br>  <br>  Man.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	I have friends who are BATTLESTAR GALLACTICA fans...|`|AA11466759	Good God, no, don't compare us to rabid fangirls, we have more dignity than that!!!|`|y1CRemnPaa	they're just like the star wars fans.<br>  <br>  mormonism brought the add-ons, but they weren't as good as the first parts, so they were like, "Screw you episode one." and they stopped watching|`|LTA8lynMaa	Well there are 66 books that make up the Bible so really the sequels have already been made.|`|256t9bIqaa	The force is strong with Harry Potter!|`|9k3q70azaa	No

I can't be certain of her being a vampyr.<br>  the sneakiness and quietness just says she's a shy person who doesn't know how to make friends properly.<br>  just go up to her and say hi, make friends with her and see what kind of person she may be. Just let me know what the result is though coz I am actually fascinated by this now.<br>  <br>  Little Red Dragon<br>  <br>  P.S.

18gIVR8aaa	I'm a christian girl and I am bi. I've always believed that God will love me no matter what I do. I have a personal relationship with him and I talk to him as much as I can. I pray almost every night, and I know he still loves me. I do not think I'm going to hell for loving someone. You can't change who you are, and don't try! Be proud of yourself! It doesn't matter what you're friends say about it. This is between you and God. Just remember, he'll never stop loving you.|`|AA10861649	I dont think God made people to be gay and on that note i dont think its chosen either, you can never prove to me its genetic,but I think with God help you can walk away from it as much as some people say you cant, I personally cant help you, youre going to have tons of gay people saying be happy with yourself and straight people saying go the other direction, try and talk to this lady she might be able to help you more<br>  <a href="http://www.venusmagazine.org/cover_story.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.venusmagazine.org/cover_story...</a>|`|cVewVL0Taa	You can still be gay and believe in God.

9d324139a59bc1e69bcfeb3145f249efaa	My understanding of the Gnostic's was that they felt that possession of a Physical Body made them eminently part of the world, that is why they posited a Separate King of the Earth, Rex Mundi, in conjunction with the King of Heaven.  I tend to feel that since I am, in fact, in and a part of this world, then it really doesn't matter how I feel about being here, my concern is to live my life in a manner that makes the parts of the world I can influence, however small those might be, a little better for everyone.|`|xU0xtg2zaa	Too deep for me..<br>  <br>  Seriously, if i think about too much, i might punch my thigh in annoyance of my existence.....

IwXuWX05aa	The nutty people in any cult can call themselves whatever they want.   Dorothy started out in Kansas.  I wonder if the wicked witch of the east and the wicked witch of the west had the last name Phelps.  It would be better if they called themselves Westboro Phelps Church since it is mostly just the members of one family.   Hmmmm...one family....hmmm...where did all the kids come from?|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Sadly, they have the right to call themselves what they want, as long as they aren't using a trademarked name (and Baptist isn't). But never mind what they call themselves... just remember what most sane people call them! (And I won't repeat any of it here.)|`|6jAVElX7aa	why are you quoting chapter 13 in Romans. It says love does no harm to his neighbour. How about the harm and pain homosexuals cause their parents?  So bringing grief to a parent who loves his her child is not a sin?|`|k7FD3rt5aa	They're DISGUSTING! Ppl like that r impossible to understand!|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Please, the Baptists were already soiled long before Westboro came along. Everyone thinks you're insane except you. All the Westboro cult did was take Baptist beliefs and carry them to their logical ends. They are displaying for the world the danger not only within the Baptist church, but within Christianity as a whole.<br>  <br>  Should you be offended? Absolutely. But you have no right to complain about it when you are part of the religion. Your participation VALIDATES them. It makes them stronger.<br>  <br>  If what your religion does offends you so much, why don't you leave?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Yes, and the majority of them have in some way significantly contributed to racial, sexual, or gender intolerance. Christianity as a whole is responsible for millions of ongoing deaths all over the world.<br>  <br>  I associate with people or groups who tend not to do bad things. The issue is not keeping my own name clear. The issue is that I don't want to give strength through numbers to organizations that abuse power. Like the Baptists. And like Christianity.<br>  <br>  Humanity does bad things, but I can choose which side of history I will be on.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Patriotism is your main problem with them!<br>  Not that they show up at tragedies to get media attention for their message of hate and anti-gay agenda. Never mind Baptist how about Christians. I think people get the message they are a just a hate group.|`|DA53AFKhaa	what do patriotism and faith have to do with each other?<br>  dont we angry, do what you can to love and better your community, be a servant thats what the bible says|`|DqtSdgtPaa	Their behavior isn't just unpatriotic, it's down right cruel.

But yeah probably some what pissed.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	They are INHUMANE!! ("They" need to EARN Respect!!)  You are right to be angry!!  <')))><|`|qMCHLrKCaa	You shouldn't be angry "as a Baptist."  Anger doesn't solve anything, and a lack of charity is hardly in keeping with the tenets of Christianity, where we are taught to hate the sin but love the sinner.  Maybe you could just settle for being disappointed as a human being.<br>  <br>  Grace be unto you and peace.|`|lKBoTN7Vaa	You should be and you should be angry at all the crazy FUN-DUHs out there as well try to say the Flintstones is the history channel . You should also be angry with anyone who drags your name through the mud by racist or bigoted remarks about anyone or tries to strip them of their rights .|`|y1CRemnPaa	you as a baptist should consider the fact that even if they ignore a particular part of the bible, everything they say or do is backed up by other parts of scripture, and that your faith works the same way, unless you follow the scriptures that say slavery is a good thing or command that rape victims should be punished while their attackers are rewarded.|`|AA10517807	you are going to have the same problem as the mormons people who wont know the difference are going to think that you are the same|`|FN8meC6taa	Most Baptist hate gays so it's not. Infact, all evangelicals hate gays as well.|`|rU6nh42Eaa	I would be angry too.  I am angry that they are considered "Christian" when they are anything but.  But let us be angry and sin not.|`|oil8ALh4aa	sylvia c <br>  your stupid, my brother didn't cause my parents any grief. they're happy for him.

UxSF3Doaaa	They are both created by God<br>  Both groups sinned against God<br>  Jesus died for the sins of both groups|`|AA11440601	Faith.<br>  <br>  I personally think Atheists are people of great faith. <br>  <br>  They believe the entire wonderful universe came into being all by itself from the smallest subatomic particle to the most immense galaxy and from the amazing complexity of the human mind to the love between a mother and child.<br>  <br>  I find it much easier to believe that an all powerful and all loving God is behind it all. <br>  <br>  "To be an atheist requires an indefinitely greater measure of faith than to receive all the great truths which atheism would deny."  (Joseph Addison)<br>  <br>  I do not have enough faith to be an Atheist.<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 2123-2126: <a href="http://www.nccbuscc.org/catechism/text/pt3sect2chpt1.shtml#2122" rel="nofollow">http://www.nccbuscc.org/catechism/text/p...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|lJUyhMceaa	They are both sinners.  <br>  <br>  They were both created by God.  <br>  <br>  They both will stand before Him some day.  <br>  <br>  They both have an eternity to look forward to.<br>  <br>  I could go on and on, but these are the most important.<br>  <br>  What do they NOT have in common.......<br>  <br>  The Atheist is still lost in their own sins, while the Christians sins have been paid for by the shed blood of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  The Atheist does not want to acknowledge that God created Him although he knows it is true, while the Christian fully accepts this truth and gives God the glory for it.<br>  <br>  The Atheist is not looking forward to standing before God, but the Christian knows, through Christ Jesus, he is at peace with God.<br>  <br>  The Christian knows he has an eternity in heaven to look forward to, while the Atheist does not want to admit his eternity is looking very bleak.|`|45b08ca1dc880690ca7764657e05b376aa	They could have many things in common. They may like the same foods, movies and music. However there could be problems when it comes to ones faith in God and the others lack of faith. As long as they respect each others right to believe in what they believe and not try to push their thought on the other they could be fine.|`|pJ7icz0taa	They are Human Beings and kind to others.   You cannot fault Atheist for not believing when they ask of proof...You cannot fault  Christians for believing the unknown.

Then there's the two types of Christians: those that will proclaim "I am Christian!" and then go off and live their life of sin anyway, and the Christian who devotes their life to God and tries their hardest to save others the pain and suffering that will come to them after they get to the Judgement and realize "oh darn, should have listened."|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Is it just me or does it seem Y!A Christians by and large lack basic education in spelling, grammar, punctuation, and syntax?<br>  <br>  If the sampling of Christians in this forum is representative of the whole, I would have to say the biggest difference is that Christians have poor English skills.|`|gOwakeM1aa	We are all made in the image of God (Gen 1:26), separate from the animal creatures who have no soul.<br>  <br>      We shall all give account to him (Christ) that will judge the quick (living) and the dead (1 Peter 4:5-7).|`|VQmHIrStaa	They are both amazing human beings who fully deserve love and compassion.|`|EHbxdFiHaa	Your grammar is terrible. <br>  Seeing as how you're clearly a redneck based off of the fact that you are Republican, I am not that surprised.|`|fjWSayzuaa	they both live in a world where God exists, but only one is willing to acknowledge and admit it<br>  <br>  God's love is available to ALL!|`|e67045ea08edd6bf714e0243622a0defaa	Both of their beliefs rely purely on faith.

4qA9Y7m9aa	Well most of them usually follow it up with "I hated God..." and that makes me skeptical.<br>  <br>  If you hate God, you believe in one.  Thus you weren't a f***in' atheist.<br>  <br>  I've talked to two that I think really were atheists.  They both said they actively called themselves that, and got what it meant.  Interestingly, both were Pagans now, not Christians.|`|yAvTxh47aa	Wicca is the first and only religion I've held, and I became Wiccan as an adult. Before that I was an atheist. I wasn't angry at any god, because I didn't believe in any god. My reaction to encounter with the divine was denial, disbelief and finally acceptance....I didn't profit from it in any way, if anything it cost me friends and relationships at the time...<br>  <br>  My family is not Christian, so I've never been Christian.<br>  <br>  Some Christians like to say former Christians were never Christian. Some atheists like to say former atheists were never atheists.<br>  <br>  If it makes them happy, it's no skin off my nose, I think they're equally wrong. If it makes them unhappy and that's what they want, so be it.<br>  <br>  But I also think if the gods wanted to correct them they'd do so, so it's not my business.<br>  <br>  Atheism is a perfectly logical reaction to having no evidence of the divine. I have a lot more understanding of the view of not believing in a god that you've never met (pardon the negatives) than I do for believing in a god you've never met.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	In some ways that's true. I have never, ever known an atheist who converted to any sort of religion.<br>  <br>  However, I have met converts who called themselves "atheist" but upon further discussion, turned out not to be atheists at all. What they were, in actuality, was angry at "god."<br>  <br>  The kinda of people who say "I'm an atheist because god made the world such a terrible place." Well, if you think that god has anything to do with making the world, then you must think god exists. Thus, that person isn't actually an atheist.|`|26Qb0cUjaa	Eh<br>  <br>  If you are actually atheist, only solid evidence would make you habeeb in a god<br>  <br>  And since no such evidence is known to exist..|`|nVCf8EC5aa	For some reason Christians tend to have a propensity to lie about this subject.

I'll assume you meant "few former atheists were ever real ones to begin with".  I personally don't think there are any real atheists, but in this case I'll say "no".  I think they were real atheists before they became Christian.  But then my whole argument is lost to you because I don't believe there is such thing as a true atheist.|`|Z92LPUqaaa	A lot of them are being honest, and were at one time atheists and for some reason or another became Christian.  But  the way some of the others speak, I wonder if they really were atheists or just angry at their God.  When I hear a former atheist telling atheists what they believe, I can usually spot it.  Such as if they say they used to be an atheist because they were angry at God, it is a sure thing that they were never an atheist.  I think a lot of these types don't quite understand what atheism is.|`|t88527U1aa	I believe that once you invite Christ in forever he is with you.

I used to laugh at Christian to their faces made fun of all things to do with Christ or Religion.

I would presume that once the decision has been reached that one is an atheist, then that person is an actual atheist.  I think people may make statements like that because they are not sure about what they believe and think that if others no longer or have never believed that that might happen to them as well.  Consequently they make up all sorts of reasons that the person wasn't/isn't a real Christian/atheist.|`|hYzfzu9yaa	I don't pretend to know the former or current beliefs of anyone, or whether or not they were "real".

NmsBFeNJaa	I've never heard of this before. Virginity is the very definition of goodness, purity, and modesty. There is nothing wrong with being a virgin and I was proud to be one well in to my twenties. I have a beautiful, smart, and talented friend who is a 26 year old virgin and I admire her greatly.

No one here can answer this for you, only your friend can do that. Suffice to say, ANYONE can be stupid. I personally think ALL religions are stupid, but that is just ME. I have no interest in whether you are gay, bi, or otherwise. I see no point in homosexuality, and I am against it being called a "normal" behavior but I am not about to legislate against a minority just because I do not like it and consider it abnormal. The Mormons were just supporting legislation which happened to discriminate against gays regarding marriage in California. They did not hide the fact of their support. That does not mean ALL Mormons discriminate as SOME do. Ask your friend for yourself. There is no logical connection between bigotry and any specific religion or lack thereof.

I have gone to about 5 different churches, and I have quit out of pure shame at what the people there are like.

sddOpDt7aa	I'm LDS as well, but former baptist. I can tel lyou overhearing other churches speak it is because they do not think Joseph Smith is a true prophet/vessel of God like the OT/NT prophets. they also do not believe they can use the book of Mormon along with the bible, though they are very open minded with other scrolls being found like the dead sea scrolls...  so sad that they donot put their opinions aside & look into the truth because God put his people on ALL the conrners of the earth not just in Israel.|`|D0JKJJNeaa	people assume that it is because you hear so many different things about it, and its many sects some of which have cult type behavior.<br>  what I think you want is a simple answer mostly its what people see has a group were there is person who is the control freak religious leader, I know little of the church, but the people I have talked to about it fail to tell me much other than to read the book of Mormon, and those pamphlets that have information with the churches views on the world are, that change depending on your location in country.<br>  Also there is the image that the Mormon Church has in the media which is men who are abusive towards woman, and have multiple wives, that is a flag for cult behavior on the outside it looks like what Charles Manson did in his cult "The Family".|`|5e5c65a2cd3552e7b1ff218d6c990e26aa	All cults have a central figure that takes the position of God in terms of power to determine truth.  Joseph Smith is unique to the Mormon Church and he is not questioned - Mormons question what is historically considered to be God's pure Word (the Bible) more than Joseph Smith.<br>  <br>  Mormons are strongly discouraged to seek or research spiritual truth apart from Mormon teaching and literature.  That is a VERY strong trend with cults.  Questioning your faith can get you in very hot water and looking at "anti-Mormon" literature is strictly discouraged.<br>  <br>  The Mormon church has an us-and-them mentality.  I have seen this with my children's own friends at school.  Friendships with Mormons are rarely enduring.  Mormons claim an elitist position in the world of churches.  They cannot continue to "fellowship" with those who do not believe as they.<br>  <br>  Mormons are not encouraged to think independently.  That really concerns me.<br>  <br>  Of course, the most compelling reason Mormonism is considered a cult is that it takes historical Christianity and alters each part of it, each belief, just enough to rob it of its power and truth.|`|AA11614944	It could have something to do with joe smith being a false prophet.

If HER daughter couldn't get in, obviously I couldn't. I applied to that school, and I was accepted. When she asked me where I got in I told her, and I wasn't ugly about it at all, but I definitely felt that surge of personal pride in knowing I proved someone wrong in the best kind of way. <br>  <br>  I think we're allowed to be proud of our accomplishments as long as we acknowledge that God is behind all of it in the end, and without Him we wouldn't have any of it. I think God is happy when we are happy and do good things, and we're allowed to be happy about it too as long as we're also humble.|`|3mDvjCa8aa	Disagree, because no matter how successful you become one day you will be dying and realize how stupid the whole competition was.

grwtwPbAaa	References Nephilim<br>  by Judd H. Burton <br>  Genesis 6:4 states <br>  "The Nephilim were on the earth in those days --and also afterwards-- when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown." The Nephilim were a race of giants that were produced by the sexual union of the sons of God (presumably fallen angels) and the daughters of men. Translated from the Hebrew texts, "Nephilim" means "fallen ones." They were renowned for their strength, prowess, and a great capacity for sinfulness. <br>  The origination of the Nephilim begins with a story of the fallen angels. Shemhazai, an angel of high rank, led a sect of angels in a descent to earth to instruct humans in righteousness. The tutelage went on for a few centuries, but soon the angels pined for the human females. After lusting, the fallen angels instructed the women in magic and conjuring, mated with them, and produced hybrid offspring: the Nephilim. <br>  <br>  The Nephilim were gigantic in stature. Their strength was prodigious and their appetites immense. Upon devouring all of humankind's resources, they began to consume humans themselves. The Nephilim attacked and oppressed humans and were the cause of massive destruction on the earth<br>  www.panthelon.org/articles/n/ nephilim.html<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Below is what I personally believe: and I am not saying this idea is correct,only a theory!!!!!!<br>  Most people believe that demons and fallen angels are the same. They are not!<br>  <br>  Demons: are the offspring’s from fallen angels and the daughters of men. (See Gen: 6) <br>  During this time the human race veers away from God. Rulers develop harems, signaling sexual dissipation, and criminal acts that violate the rights of others are excessive. And “violence” (Gen 6: 11) – acts that intentionally damage others- are rampant. Noah, who is not only righteous but is living blamelessly among his neighbors, is living as a preacher of righteousness. He is busy telling others that a judgment day is coming. Genesis 6:2 states “the sons of god saw that the daughters of men were beautiful…. The sons of god were in fact part of Satan’s fallen angels. (See 2 Peter 2:4, Jude 6). These fallen angels had union with the daughters of men, and the result was the birth of giants. The flood occurred and the resulting physical death of these giant offspring happened. However, Moses said the giants were on the earth in Noah’s time, after the flood. <br>  The book of Job (which is the oldest book of the bible) refers to the “sons of god” as angels. So it is believed that the giant’s spirits remained alive without natural bodies. It must be remembered that they are evil, since they are the offspring of fallen angels. Since they lost their bodies they crave to possess one. Jesus refers to those who walk through dry places. These offspring are known as demons. Since they are of the earth they remain on the earth, seeking to destroy whosoever they “can”. They were born of this world, and they remain on this earth and they are not airborne.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ORIGION OF DEMONS<br>  <br>  Since demons are the product of the daughters of men and the fallen angels, they are known now as demons. Once you understand where the demons came from (sexual sin) you know where they like to best operate in. Demons work in the areas of sexual immorality. They are unclean spirits. Their fathers were the fallen angels. God didn’t spare these fallen angels (2 Peter 2:4). He sent these to hell, but not all of the fallen angels sinned with the daughters of men. Of the fallen angels that didn’t commit this particular sin they became Satan’s celestial group, the principalities, etc. Not only do these demons operate in the areas of sexual sin they also love violence, since that was part of their origin. Sexual perversion, lust, and violence go hand in hand since their fathers were of the above. They continuously attack the unredeemed man as well as the redeemed. There is a limited amount of demons, but there number is not known. Remember that Jesus cast them out of a naked man into a herd of pigs and when asked how many were inside this man. The Lord answered “a legion” (which is one thousand). And why were Jewish men herding pigs? As Christians this is an important question because if Satan even has a small foothold of leverage in our lives – he will use it against us to consume us. Since man is of the flesh, sexual sin is one of the hardest to get rid of.<br>  These demons are tireless; they will attack men endlessly until there is no purity left in any. The book of Genesis describe that sexual immorality and violence go hand in hand with these forces of hell. These two activities create many perversions for men and women alike – and that had much to do with why God brought on the flood – to rid the world of this evil. We must guard ourselves against these particular sins as they can completely overtake the soul. People who have these evil spirits in their lives usually display violence and sexual sin. <br>  <br>  <br>  The difference between the remaining fallen angels and demons are many. Fallen angels are more powerful since they are of themselves originally God’s creation. In other words there was no union with man. Jude verse 9 states that even Michael the archangel didn’t rebuke these princes of darkness – He said “The Lord rebukes you”.<br>  Prayer and intercession work well in this area because God will send His archangels to fight on our behalf. These fallen angels are powerful like the air force compared to the infantry (demons).<br>  These fallen angels have higher authority, as well. They exercise their power in world politics, or in changing public opinions about sexual consent for instance. They persuade millions of people to change their philosophies.<br>  <br>  THEIR MAIN BUSINESS IS TO STOP OR PREVERSE THE IDEAS AND STANDARDS GOD WANTS UPHELD. <br>  <br>  Spirits of the air – they work in the intellectual realms that continuously tell us that we deserve things. These spirits never stop trying to deceive nations or individuals to sin. And they convince us that the thoughts they send are worthy. That is why we must question all of our belief systems and statements and bring them under the light of God’s word. Once these evil angels have brought into the world all kinds of confusion Satan’s demons can take possession or even render Christian’s testimony to be weakened so that he will do nothing for God in his life.<br>  Once the culture of the world has been changed the demons have all the inroad they need to keep the world asleep.<br>  Eph. 4 says that we are not to let sin get even a foothold in our lives. One of Satan’s agendas is to render all Christians as powerless as he can.<br>  If our walk with God is rendered ineffective he hinders many from declaring victory in their lives over sin. He loves to cause confusion, and wants us to stay in a state of continuous defeat. From: Strawberry.<br>  <br>  (According to the New American Bible, the Nephilim appear as part of the “increasing wickedness of mankind”.

The Church at this time assumed this position after agreeing with the "interpretation" of one Christian writer, Julius Africanus (A.D. 200-245). Julius would "formulate" an interpretation of a very controversial scripture verse, thereby setting the course for what would be a defection away from what the early Church first believed. This is centered on a couple of   KEY scripture verses that "unlocks" much of end-time bible prophecy. Julius Africanus "interpretation" of the term "son's of God" in the Old Testament, was upheld by the Jews at the time also, when Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai in the 2nd century A.D., "cursed " all those who believed in the LITERAL INTERPRETATION OF THE BIBLE, concerning the meaning of the term "sons of God". That's right, it was considered to be "blasphemous" to believe in what the bible said!. The"bible" at that time, consisted of the Septuagint (which was around when Christ walked the earth), Latin Vulgate, and various Hebrew versions of the Old Testament (Torah etc.). The first "complete" bible was in the form of the Latin Vulgate. The fact is, there is NO room for mis-translation here, which shall prove that the Church willfully chose to become APOSTATE on the meaning of "sons of God", and still remains today. This, even though all bibles translated after the Septuagint LXX, were translated in part from the Codex Alexandrinus. The Codex translates the term "sons of God" as "ANGELS of God". Every single modern day translation, was translated from the Codex Alexandrinus to some degree. The Latin vulgate would be the first translation to "cover over" INTENTIONALLY, the meaning of this term. By the late 4th century A.D., the Syrian church had managed to make the interpretation of Julius Africanus, known as the "good son's of Seth view", as official church "doctrine". Subsequently, it became policy of Papal theologians at that time, to eradicate firmly from the teachings of the Church, any doctrine or dogma contrary to the "son's of Seth view". The fact of the matter is, this interpretation and its apparent doctrine is a flat-out, heretical LIE, and completely apostate to the Word of God. This interpretation has and still does hide the KEY behind Satan's end-time "master plan" for these last day's, and completely undermines much end-time prophecy interpretation, keeping the entire body of Christ in utter DARKNESS! <br>  <br>  FALLEN ANGELS<br>  <br>         This controversy, surrounds the interpretation of the term "son's of God" used in the books of Genesis and Job. The term is properly rendered bene ha elohim in the Hebrew. The predicament here is that both the Septuagint and the torah translates this term as meaning that of ANGELS, and thereby creating one of the most disturbing doctrinal dilemmas the Church has ever had to face. The reality is, this rendering is the TRUTH. There is NO way to get around this one. As a matter of fact, it is IMPOSSIBLE to avoid the stark truth of this meaning, yet the false prophets and teachers have managed to perpetuate the "good sons of Seth" heresy for 1900 years via false theology. Those proponents that would say that the Holy Spirit would clarify over time the now accepted "son's of Seth" interpretation, are HERETICS!. God doesn't play games with his Word, if that's what it says, that's what it says!, and God MEANS what he says. Why must we try to fit Gods Word around our own idealology of what REALITY should or should not be.|`|CnqGu1Taaa	Gary no offense but I believe mankind are the fallen angels........bought back with a price Jesus's Blood,we are adopted by the Father in Heaven when we bow our knee and receive Jesus as our Savior<a href="http://bible.cc/john/8-44.htm" rel="nofollow">http://bible.cc/john/8-44.htm</a>|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	As Jude put it, they forsook their original heavenly position for a period of living on the earth.<br>  <br>  They are one and the same.|`|XeelPs6Waa	Cain killed the second prophet Abel (Adam was the first) and Seth was born to be instead of Abel. Adam had other sons and daughters but the prophetic seed are listed in order of birth throughout chapter 5 of Genesis. Note also that each of the prophetic seed had other sons and daughters but only one was singled out and mentioned by name. These were the Sons of God and instead of fulfilling their prophetic calling, they fell into lust for beautiful women which God had not given to them and faith became watered down. This prompted the great flood because religion was lost. Note that Adam is called the Son of God in Luke 3:38 and chapter 3 lists Jesus Genealogy starting with Joseph and ending with everyone listed in Genesis 5. Genesis 5 is the ancestral breakdown of Jesus, the original Sons of God.|`|gLyD1CiIaa	When the angels of God decided to disobey God and have relations with women, they left their first estate of being angels, becoming like men, but not men, for they were never born. <br>  <br>  That is why Jesus said a man must be born of water and of spirit to enter the kingdom of God. If he had worded it differently, it could have opened up the door to the fallen angels to salvation. <br>  <br>  For instance Jesus would not have said that and just said a man must be born again to enter the kingdom of God, it could have opened the door to the fallen angels to salvation. Yet, Jesus made it clear, that a man must be born of water and of spirit to enter the kingdom of God. This ensured the angels would not gain that salvation given from God to mankind.|`|AA10988107	Also: 1Pet.3:18-20 are the same angels.<br>  <br>  1Cor.6:2,3, saints will judge the angels, they will be equal to the<br>  angels, Luke 20:34-36, and they will not be raised up until Satan<br>  and 1/3 unholy angels are cast down to have a short time in the <br>  time of the end.

fjsczTsMaa	Yes, because Christians think that celebrating anything that isn't directly Christian is evil, so any other religions or beliefs were suppressed. <br>  <br>  Just look at the Inquisitions that were carried out historically throughout Europe and some of Asia:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Also, take a look at some of the witch hunts: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt</a>|`|8RmazUuBaa	I hope so...

AA12245463	King (messiah) Cyrus of Persia was the King that allowed the Israelites to return to the promised land from Babylonia.<br>  <br>  The word moshiach (messiah) simply means anointed -- as in anointed king.  There have been innumerable messiahs (anointed kings) throughout the ages.  THE messiah will usher in an era of universal peace ON EARTH.<br>  <br>  Btw, THE messiah will be a great HUMAN leader.  He will not have supernatural powers and will not condemn "non-believers" to a mythical place of eternal torment.<br>  <br>  Shalom<br>  .|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: I'll star for my Jewish contacts to hit the first part<br>  <br>  the second is King Cyrus, he was called a righteous man.

6SwaWSoyaa	I say do the first option. As you are working as RN you might lose your interest in becoming a full-on doctor. By the way I think you are the one who lives near it, but I finally got accepted to Ball State. If you aren't the one who lives near Muncie then I am going to feel like a complete dumbass.|`|4mZd0Abnaa	I would say either way would be fine, if you're fine with either. If you're in a rush to work, take the shorter route. If you don't mind going to school for another more few years, take the longer route. Either way, you could still go to Med School still. <br>  <br>  Good luck!@|`|UbvglIS6aa	Go for the Doc.  Anything that distracts you from your real goal is going to keep you from getting there.  If you take the RN route, it will be very hard to find time for the real goal.  RNs work very hard and very long hours.  I'm not saying it isn't possible.  I'm only saying that you have to keep your eye on the prize.
Ps9eOIchaa	Ok me,i'm normally chill,but i do have severe anger and temper issues and i bottle up my anger,and then it's like *tick*,someone(usually my mom) will do something that slightly irritates me or isn't even a big deal,and i'll start out irritated,but within minutes it turns into rage,i can feel it,my heart beats faster,and i have a need to hit something,not someone but something  and let it out by screaming.Here's the thing,i've learned to keep myself from doing something i might regret,like i'll be boiling furious,and i can feel the blood rush and pure anger and i want to let it out and i'll say i'll cuss them out or whatever but i think about what the consequences in the future may be.I do have a very short temper though so it isn't hard to irritate me,but i keep my anger and irritation inside,i don't express my feelings and then one day someone will set me off and boy you better run,honestly i scare myself with my anger at times|`|Uy58ixnvaa	I would say yeah. Someone that flies off the rocker every day can only get but so mad. When you don't get mad often, the few times you do, it's a rage. Sometimes I think patient people are more dangerous than those with short tempers, because they bottle it up and let it out in one, explosive rage.|`|npTZTzWRaa	my penis gets furious when women wont suck it
XN0cYCATaa	Should a Christian go to war?<br>  This question has caused a lot of division in the body of Christ. Should a Christian go to war where he might kill other people when the Bible says to "turn the other cheek" (Luke 6:28)? Is it right to do war against others or does the Bible forbid it?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.carm.org/questions/other-questions/should-christian-go-war" rel="nofollow">http://www.carm.org/questions/other-ques...</a>|`|QpF6Tjtiaa	the bible promotes stoning people for working on sunday, killing first born children (more than one incident), rape, incest, pedophilia, ect.

Jesus said there would be wars and rumors of wars. Revelation is clear that the blood of that war will rise to the horses bridals.<br>  <br>  The difference between murder and killing is the same as the difference between buying something and stealing it.|`|RIt7ogIuaa	According to the bible killing is just fine and dandy as long as it's justified. You should read the New Testament (don't even bother with that New Testament bullshit OK?) it's filled with violence and gore.|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	If you kill someone in war, you don't hate the person you're killing, which would be murder, and you're under your country's authority.|`|lKBoTN7Vaa	God loves violence .|`|kKCJqfTdaa	The old testament did, but that was a different time.

After the return of Christ and His ruling from this earth, the wars will stop.  Thanks for asking.|`|AA10988107	Matt.24:4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.<br>  <br>  24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.<br>  <br>  24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.<br>  <br>  24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.<br>  <br>  24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrow.|`|JXfGHsF6aa	Rom 12:17-21 ..... If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.   Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.   Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.   Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.|`|6jAVElX7aa	A nation has the right to defend themselves against invaders.

ftLnGjpKaa	Some accounts say that the cyclopes were a race of giants having one eye in their head.  They existed even before the Greek gods led by Zeus, in the time the Titans ruled.<br>  <br>  Others list only three cyclopes who were the sons of the Titan Uranus.|`|NR3YnkVPaa	The Odyssey says that they were the son of Poseidon, nasty cannibals, quite unsocial, and overly fond of sheep. Odysseus got chased around for 10 years by Poseidon for sticking the cyclops in the eye, so if you see any in the mall, just avoid them.
Nv3eQenUaa	You can make them more effective prayers by accepting Jesus salvation, forgiveness, purpose and guidance in your life.  In this time when you are searching at finding your life's purpose He will show it to you.    Just allow him into your heart and soul.  Pray and believe.    The answer and way will come.    <br>  <br>  Jesus I ask that you enter this soul if she be willing.  Awash her in your salvation and forgiveness.  Bathe her in your love and peace.

You should listen to the Prairie Home Companion; this is a running joke.  There are all kinds of wonderful jobs in the waitressing and ditch digging industries.  <br>  <br>  Seriously, you'll wind up in teaching, sales, or marketing unless you're really clever or really good at writing.<br>  <br>  Praying about it won't help (and I'm not just saying that because I'm an atheist.)  You should go with your heart, because you already know what you want to do and you're just resisting it.|`|rvmiK8rgaa	The New Testament  encourages us to make known our requests unto God.  Talk to God like a friend and write down imagined answers as they were your best self speaking.<br>  <br>  Your combo sounds fine to me.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself what is supremely important in your life - that is prayer as thinking.<br>  <br>  Write your own obituary for 60 years hence and see it what teaches you about your core values.  Trust your instincts|`|lDEGaK7Laa	You need to speak with an advisor first, but that major and minor sound like a good combination.|`|rz4AUvbaaa	Find your major in what you love in life, and not from a brain and a spreadsheet.|`|Qc6MqcpWaa	This doesn't really belong in R&S.<br>  <br>  Of all the people I've known who majored in english, none of them have found a decent job and have ended up going back to school to major in something else. It's difficult to do anything with it unless you write something amazing and become a successful, well-known author. If you go into it, I suggest a back-up plan. If you wanted to be an english teacher, I suggest you go major in Childhood Education (or something like that) with a concentration in english, and most likely you'd have to get your Masters degree.<br>  <br>  Also, I wouldn't worry to much about it. If you're going to be a junior and haven't settled on a major, you're not alone. I'm graduating in June and half the people in my class don't even have an idea of what they want to do. A lot of people go in undecided, and a good percentage of college students change majors anyway (some multiple times).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VdTn7Gmbaa	Yes, prayers do help.<br>  <br>  James 1:5 (New International Version)<br>  If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him.<br>  <br>  I will pray the Lord shows you the right combination.<br>  God bless.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ?

You better pray for a job once you graduate with a worthless creative writing/ communications degree.|`|6Y3mW1a2aa	No, I don't pray anymore. It's a waste of time.|`|XzksQ3AFaa	I think it's important to pray about any area of your life in which you need guidance. Ask and you shall receive, after all - if you ask God to guide you in the right direction, He will. I did, and He hasn't failed me yet! I'm now pursuing a degree in a field I didn't even know existed before, and I absolutely love it.<br>  <br>  If you think being an English major is the right thing for you, then go for it. When picking a major it is less important to pick a CAREER and more important to pick something you're good at and enjoy. If you obsess over what major can get you what career, you won't enjoy it, and there's not even any guarantee you will end up working in that field. Pick something you love, and let God show you where He wants you to work. <br>  <br>  Since you asked, the English majors I know are all teachers in middle or high school. You could also probably get into freelance journalism with an English degree, although for that a background in Journalism (i.e. a degree in the field) might be more helpful. If you love English and it works for you, stick with it, and ask an adviser at your college to help you with career planning if you are really worried about it. :)

On the way home you stand dazed in the middle of the road and a Mac truck kills you dead. Once again, there is no help for you! The priest never absolved you in his forgetfulness. <br>  <br>  You will fry and bubble like an egg for all eternity without any hope for relief or mercy from God, because He Loves you too much for that!

I don't think it's inconsiderate though.|`|s2wcWcu1aa	hehe<br>  i understand, doritos are gorgeous. she is being totally unreasonable!<br>  jk lol uhh it seems a bit strange to do those things while snuggling, if she doesnt smoke you'll get her stinking of fags :/<br>  not good.<br>  and doritoes = cheesy breath = no kisses :)<br>  gotta decide what means more to you X)|`|xFg6y1qEaa	For the smoking, she is not. It's inconsiderate for you to smoke that close to anyone that isn't smoking. You shouldn't be smoking in bed at all.

Problem solved.|`|1d685074fadc5c403a481e6292e4eb56aa	No, I hate smoke. As for the Doritos I also have crumbs in my bed, it feels funny. Anyway, to be honest, I think you're being kinda inconsiderate to her, you should  have known this annoys her. And since she has brought it to your attention I think you should respect her feelings. Point out to her things she needs to change.|`|Nsgh1XzLaa	i just hate hate hate the smell of smoke!  dont get me wrong i could be with a guy who smokes but just as long as he is not smoking near me or with me!  as for doritos..uhm.. i think that would be okay.. i guess.  but it is still rude to be eating while having sex.  and btw i think it is kinda gross to be eating while having sex.<br>  <br>  ur friend Roger|`|OdFIQYyhaa	you shouldn't smoke cigarettes in bed but doritos um you may do that.|`|gV6ofhjDaa	I can think of better things that could be "smoked" or "eaten" in bed with someone.|`|A84z46vuaa	well i think they are favorable things to ask,<br>  what if there like turn offs to her<br>  or she cares about your health?|`|rqJSk1omaa	she probably doesn't want to sleep in orange crumbs and ash.|`|xCifmFfkaa	rotflmfao, where do you live in a trailer or something??|`|iDv0tlAnaa	no it is not she is 110% right|`|36f164873fb212f4be988fa1d87ec37caa	Tell your partner that s/he either goes to bed with you, your doritos and your cigarettes.... or s/he sleeps on the couch!<br>  <br>  lol..|`|KszocgnSaa	If she asks you not smoke in bed I don't think you should.

wB3AbJyLaa	I indeed believe that is what God intended for us to do. Astronomers are discovering a whole new dimension of evidence that suggests this astounding world was created, in part, so we could have the adventure of exploring it. As astronomer Guillermo Gonzalez and science philosopher Jay Wesley Richards, who wrote the book "The Privileged Planet," elaborates. Total eclipse of the sun, which yield a treasure trove of scientific data, can only be viewed from one place in the solar system where there are intelligent beings to view them. Also, earth's location away from galaxy's center and in the flat plane of the disk provides a particularly privileged vantage point for observing both nearby and distant stars. Another example, earth provides an excellent position to detect the cosmic background radiation, which is critically important because it contains invaluable information about the properties of the universe when it was very young. Because our moon is the right size and distance to stabilize Earth's tilt, it helps preserve the deep snow deposits in our polar regions, from which scientist can determine the history of snowfall, temperatures, winds, and the amount of volcanic dust, methane, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The findings of scientists that our world appears to be designed for discovery have added a compelling new dimension to the evidence for a Creator. And, frankly, their analysis makes sense.|`|9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	Unless god is an oppressor and a hater, I don't know why god would dissaprove of our progress.|`|29X6EEsKaa	If I believed in him, I doubt he would care. That would be like saying he created us in the Middle East, and the rest of the world was put there for the heck of it. I think he made it for us to explore, to accommodate a growing population in the future, and perhaps there are other planets with life. Who knows, it's a big universe.|`|4yg7zZZ2aa	Well Khrushchev said, "Gagarin flew into space, but didn't see any God there" I guess if God doesn't like science /she/he/they should have said something!<br>  <br>  As there is no evidence for any deities I do not believe in them. However since you do, let me ask you this.<br>  <br>  How will people on Y!A to know that answer?<br>  Why not let your God speak. Ask whatever you believe in. Not us.  <br>  <br>  If she/he/they don't, I guess they don't care too much about it...|`|JyAUAbsjaa	I think he gave us brains to use and he put the planets on the earth for us to find and explore. I just wish we all had brains enough not to ruin the planets he gives us.|`|nw0fqXj9aa	Do you think god put them there in the first place? If you do you have issues.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	I don't think he cares one way or another about it.

Many of which are larger than our sun.<br>  There are at least hundreds of billions of galaxies in the Universe.<br>  <br>  Now your question seems to translate as does this exist just for us? Was all of this made simply for the benefit of one tiny blue planet in one of several hundred million spiraling galaxies?<br>  <br>  Well, I don't know.

AA10565336	It is certainly possible but I would think that most of the time they are referring to the "Corporate You".  A word being misused but intended to include all who are listening or reading.<br>  <br>  I would draw a parallel to the "Royal We".  If a Queen were to use the word "We" she is normally referring just to herself.|`|W8bs2VQSaa	Well it depends on what the context is. If I said "when you walk outside my house you see a creek" then I'd be meaning the general "you". If I said "I like the question you are asking" then obviously I mean you, Red. Its all in the context, and since you, Red, aren't giving any clues, I can't really answer you (Red).|`|O4JQF4d2aa	Haha . . . Yes.

CLB32006aa	I am an apostate mormon (LDS) and the big love show is very unrealistic in relation to LDS life|`|ttCkz39aaa	The reasons the first answer says is most likely true but hummm i am wondering if the men got the better deal lol|`|hfqUp1IBaa	It is illegal in Utah to have more than one spouse and they originally had polygamy but it was because a long long time ago  the men had gone off to war and died so mormons would take in the widowed and keep multiple wives.  Some few still practice this although it is highly illegal and the places that do it are bordering other states.  I lived in Utah for 25 years and have never met anyone in polygamy.  Also the teen thing is also false.  It is illegal to marry before 18 unless approved by both kids parents and they would have to be at least 16.  The mormon laws are the same as Utah's laws.  Nothing is different!|`|q5lreoiWaa	My father was a polygamist in Short Creek,(now Colorado City ) and it was destructive to the family unit in that a core of older men were given wives of all the women, young or not and most of the young boys were chased out and lost their homes and families. Polygamy is not a prime time TV show, it hurts real people. It is good that the mainstream LDS outlaws it.|`|uAKBGfAlaa	I am not an apostate, but actually a current member of the LDS Church (more commonly known as the Mormon Church).  Polygamy is outlawed in the Mormon Church, and even if someone in the LDS church did want to practice polygamy, they would be excommunicated.  <br>  <br>  What the first answer said was completely correct.  When the church first started, and some of our men went off to war and died, others died on the trek from New York to Utah, and left poor widows and children behind.  And with the Women not being able to own land or anything like that, they needed help, and that's when the men started taking on a couple of the widows.  Statistically, only 11% of all LDS members back then actually practiced polygamy.  <br>  <br>  The FLDS church is a totally different church.  Yes, they are a break off of our church from many, many, many years ago, but they do not have any affiliation with the mainstream LDS church.|`|VQmHIrStaa	Most of the polygamists in Utah live in southern Utah by the Arizona boarder. I go to Utah a few times a year and I've never seen any who live in Northern Utah like Salt Lake for example.<br>  <br>  The main Mormon church still technically practices polygamy because a man can be sealed(married for eternity) to multiple wives in the Mormon temple.

The nail polish is a solid substance that prevents water from reaching the nail.  This is different from henna, which is a stain that penetrates the nail and does not create a waterproof barrier.  Anything that makes this barrier, be it nail polish, or waterproof facial makeup, or a big blob of paint dropped on your arm while decorating, has to be removed.  The exception is if you are injured and you have a bandage on your arm or head or foot that cannot be allowed to get wet.  In this case you "work around it" and just wipe over the bandage w/ a damp hand.<br>  <br>  It is a blessing that you ask this because it shows you want to perfect your prayer, so I do hope you have the desire to follow through now that you know this and remove any nail polish so you can make wudu'.  Remember, what you did previously out of ignorance, Allah will forgive; if you refuse to remove the nail polish now after being told it invalidates your prayer, and thus your wudu', then Allah will hold you responsible and your prayers will not be accepted, astaghfirullah.<br>  <br>  It is hardly worth the effort to make wudu' and THEN apply polish, because you could only keep your wudu' for a few prayers before you would have to go to the bathroom, or you might pass gas or sleep, so you would have to remove it before you renewed your wudu'.  If you would like color on your fingers, you can apply henna, and inshAllah you can find some ladies in your community who specialize in that and you can have some nice patterns.  You can even use this as a way of teaching your sisters in Islam -  have a henna party and show them a halaal alternative to wearing nail polish.  <br>  <br>  May Allah bless you and help you perfect your salah, and may He increase you in beneficial knowledge, Ameen.<br>  <br>  fi Aman Allah,<br>  <br>  Nancy Umm Abdel Hamid
FEVQisMGaa	...<br>  <br>  Funny thing...<br>  Most suicide bombers are from middle income bracket families. They are generally well educated. I don't think it's to please their God. I think it's a genuine belief in sacrificing their life for what they perceive to be a noble cause.<br>  <br>  Just a thought...<br>  Is there anything in your life that you would willingly die for?<br>  <br>  I'm thinking suicide bombers have similar mentalities.<br>  Family, honor, political/religious ideology...<br>  A belief that there are some things in life that are greater than yourself.<br>  <br>  It's the same mentality of an American soldier jumping on a grenade to save his team. The same mentality of a mother shielding a child from a hail of gunfire.<br>  <br>  The Islamic camps brainwashing people to become suicide bombers is a misconception. The suicide bomber thing is as much a component of choice, as it is religious indoctrination.<br>  <br>  If it were PURELY religious indoctrination, then they wouldn't be REAL martyrs...<br>  <br>  Speaking for myself:<br>  I'll assume your referring to Islamic suicide bombers...<br>  What, they can't exist in other religions? They can.<br>  <br>  After interacting from many people in that region/religion, I was surprised with the degree of cynicism and contempt they have for religious zealotry. It was actually pretty hilarious. In Iran and Afghanistan, and many parts of the Middle-East, they trade jokes and stories about people they think are crazy w/ their religion. They're similar to "yo mama" jokes here in America. There's a central character/caricature in most of them that they antagonize.<br>  <br>  And these so called madrasas, terror camps, etc.<br>  They're versed in the arts of  war.<br>  Or at least it's logical to assume that, seeing as how they derived their training courtesy of the CIA in the 60's and the 70's.<br>  <br>  Any good military tactician knows to use suicide attacks purely as a last resort. They're not "trained" purely as suicide bombers. It's too inefficient and ineffective.<br>  <br>  They use improvised explosive devices. They use rocket propelled grenades.<br>  <br>  Granted there's an initial psychological impact given to the enemy, it gets old, really fast.<br>  <br>  The Japanese did that in World War II. And that's how they lost the war as quickly as they did. They destroyed planes and killed pilots when it was more effective to use them as non-suicide pilots. It paralyzed their Air Force.<br>  <br>  Granted there is value in a smart bomb, it's why developed nations use guided missiles--not suicide bombers.<br>  <br>  The notion that they're somehow clinically insane is ignorant.<br>  And to suggest that they're ALL ignorant Middle-Eastern illiterate thumb-less hillbillies is ignorant, too.<br>  <br>  Records of known suicide bombings have shown, again, that they were educated (usually at the college level), wealthy, and had everything in their life to lose. In some cases, they were freshly married or had families.<br>  <br>  There's no point in being a martyr if there's no one to mourn your passing. I would further argue that there's a component of narcissism to the whole equation.<br>  <br>  And why is it when a foreigner has murderous intent, it suddenly make them crazy? When the terrorists attacked the Twin Towers, most Americans were out for blood as well.<br>  <br>  How are they different from us? It doesn't make their actions excusable, but they're fighting for the same things we perceive to be correct.<br>  <br>  We fight guided by our notions of freedom. They fight for freedom from American intervention in their politics.<br>  <br>  They don't go around killing themselves for their God, or for s--ts and giggles. They don't do it because they LOVE oppression and get boners from totalitarian states. They do it for the same reasons some here would shed blood for this country.<br>  <br>  ADDENDUM: Don't suggest that they're ALL Middle-Eastern.<br>  Some of you Christians are just as f--king crazy, too. Don't call them un-intelligent. It's obvious by the way some of you type that you shouldn't have even graduated from high school.<br>  <br>  At least in third world countries they have an excuse--no public education, and a persistent life of poverty.<br>  <br>  What the f--k are your excuses?<br>  <br>  Don't project your own insecurities on to them.<br>  <br>  And just because they're Muslim they're religious documents are "unproven?"<br>  <br>  ALL religious documents are generally unprovable, or have been DIS-proven.<br>  <br>  It's because they're beliefs you believe to be different from yours.<br>  <br>  And BTW... Muslims believe in almost the same things as Christians do.<br>  <br>  They believe in Jesus Christ. They believe he's he SON of God. And they believe in the Second Coming of Christ.|`|29X6EEsKaa	Wow, there are such deep, varied answers! [/sarcasm]<br>  <br>  I think part of it is heat. You sit at your computer in your climate-controlled room, with plenty of food and water. Unfortunately, there are people who have to walk miles to get water, have little food, and live in a 2-room flat with 6 other people in 100 degree weather.<br>  <br>  Also, frustration with their situation. Imagine living in Gaza. The Israel military has blocked you from leaving and your family from coming to see you. Electricity and other utilities are cut off. Nobody knows what's going on, the food, water, and medicine are cut off, and air strikes are occurring daily. It's too noisy to sleep, and add all the stuff in the above paragraph.

You could have gotten an infection and be scarred for life and Nate moved on to someone else. Your best bet was to chat him up and get someone else to call 911; he may have been mad at you for that, but if he was really going to kill himself he'd have been grateful later.<br>  Generally when someone is bent on suicide they don't tell anyone, they just do it.<br>  Nate may have been feeling down, but most likely looking for attention.<br>  Most often when someone is bent on suicide they give hints of doing so by giving personal property away like their television sets, computers, pets, etc. and often call someone, make it short and say in a round about way, "good bye".|`|e6zJFfd8aa	yea i made a mistake... and now i cant wear short sleeves|`|Ao52XHjCaa	I've never cut. I have a different compulsive pain management mechanism. Unintentionally, I take my right-hand index finger nail and run it in circles on my right thumb joint. I don't realize I do this, but I have developed a "worry wart" callous on my thumb over the years. Cutting and suicidal thoughts are different things. Cutting is pain management. Suicidal thoughts are different. I've only had them once when I hadn't gotten any sleep for a long time.  When I hear about them from others, I get nervous.|`|EWR01atlaa	Actually i don't blame you. I would have done the same thing. i did do something like that for my boyfriend for a dare. How stupid was i. i actually carved his name on my leg, it wouldn't stop bleeding for a whole week. <br>  And i used to cut over everything happening in my life. And i saw my boyfriend making out with another girl. And it kinda hurt me really bad, cause i really loved him. So i used to cut. i quit sometime ago though.<br>  -M<br>  And for suicide.. well i've never actually thought about doing that.|`|8OXVSoe0aa	ok thats a little freaky. and cutters only want attention. That's the whole point. They want people to "discover" the cuts on their arm to get attention.

I take medication and go to a day program called Trilogy, and this helps me a lot.|`|86ZdwbB7aa	wow ... ermm yeah .. <br>  <br>  i tried to hang myself (it failed) im always thinking of suicide and almost been drove to it many times (especially when my best friend who i fell in love with moved) and even picked my best which was to just walk off a building erm cutting i started to but i was caught ... wow i must admit this is a depressing conversation|`|Im9cwUIyaa	Yes.  When I was younger I would constantly wish i were dead and hurt myself.  Mainly because I was gay.  I was Christian and I had a MAJOR hard time dealing with it.  I actually ended up in the hospital for attempted suicide.  But as you can tell, I'm better :)|`|2DahzSWvaa	Heck no I have never thought of cutting. I hate when I cut myself on accident.

wB3AbJyLaa	The whole reincarnation idea is just really difficult to believe because more people are being born all the time and the world's population is growing. But if souls just die and come back, where are all the extra souls coming from? New ones? And are no souls being enlightened and going to Nirvana? It just doesn't make sense. It also ignores what's essential to people, what makes them who they are. For instance, if you say, "Bob is no the other room, and he has lost five pounds," people might say, "Good for him." What if you said, "Bob is in the other room and guess what? He's a grasshopper." Most people would say, "That can't be Bob, because if there's one thing I know about him, it's that he's human. He's not a grasshopper." Well, reincarnation says that I could come back as a grasshopper. But if that's true, I wouldn't be Bob anymore. I would be a grasshopper. My humanness is an essential part of who I am. Another reason I don't believe in reincarnation is that the evidence for it, things like memories of past lives, can be explained by other means: Psychological explanations, or lucky guesses, or even demonic influence. Lastly, if I become a reincarnated snail, how do I retrieve a human form? By being a good snail?|`|rU6nh42Eaa	The flaws are in the purpose of it.  If, as the person ahead says, the soul or energy or life force has to go somewhere else, and that's it, then there is no purpose beyond that.  If there is "karma" or something else that implies purpose, is it really happening?  Why does a person have no memory at all of past lives, so he can more effectively do his duty in this life?  I'm ignoring the handful of reincarnation memory stories.  Why do we have no evidence of souls reaching higher levels?  We can point out some "great souls" in history, but are we getting more of them as time goes on?  Mankind doesn't seem to be advancing in that respect.  If people are doing so badly at working out their karma, is there a point to it?<br>  <br>  Another thought -- with the sharp increase in population, have we used up all the available souls or are new ones being created to meet demand?  Of course, that depends on whether we are thinking of Hindu reincarnation or Buddhist rebirth.|`|iAtanlT8aa	There are many flaws in reincarnation as mentioned by many others so i will just skip that part.  But the reincarnation i believe in is different and i will explain it.<br>  <br>  I believe that the universe works in a loop so that it never starts nor stops, eliminating the need for a creator.  Without any outside influences on the cycle, after one dies, the cycle will continue back around to birth where life will start again, there will be no changes to the life and the same occurances will take place for their are no changes to the cycle.  One does not recall anything from the life before, which is the exact same.<br>  <br>  I do not believe in spirits and i believe that ones state of mind comes from his genetics and life experiences which is what makes that person make the decisions that he makes.  It is all just a loop and we are just a compound of multiple complex chemical reactions on a highly active planet amongst a cycle of time.|`|8f1i9DWyaa	Reincarnation supports elitism in the form of the caste system. The elites in the higher caste have evolved to a higher state because they are good; lesser types of lower castes were not as good, lesser types have a long way to go to get to Nirvana. Elites led gooder lives, have a shorter way to go to get to Nirvana. <br>  Reincarnation supports the caste system.|`|CstmsRDKaa	1 is not a flaw for you are not always reincarnated into a person but you could be a tree or a flea or anything that lives.so hitler is probably a cockroach or something.|`|kR8S9jTyaa	theres no reincarnation, its a stupid idea believed by ignorant people.<br>  <br>  when we die our soul's return to our Creator for judgment and spend eternity as appropriate|`|Wo1BkKTBaa	There are no flaws to it. The energy of your soul has to go somewhere after you die, and why not a new body?|`|Shi5z6iJaa	it presupposes a metaphysical soul when there is no evidence for it|`|UBcBjRMfaa	Reincarnation, and indeed any religious/spiritual question is difficult to answer. Everyone will have different thoughts. <br>  <br>  Insofar as the flaws you've listed, flaw 1 is kind of the point of reincarnation, you want to do good in this life, to protect your next one. It's a goal to work towards, and a reason for living with virtue. Also, say you are the baby embedded with the spirit of someone who's done a good deal of wrongs in your past life/lives. You can still live virtuously in this one in hopes that your next will be better. <br>  <br>  In flaw two you've missed a small step. We HAVE greatly advanced. Miracles occur everyday in terms of technological advances, while society itself is looking down on intolerance to a degree never seen. Even without believing in reincarnation you can see that we learn from others' past lives simply by taking a history class.<br>  <br>  So, now what are some flaws with reincarnation? <br>  First I would say there is the "mind-body" problem (or maybe better phrased here as the "mind-soul" problem). That is, is there such a thing as a soul? Is it entirely distinct from my body? Permeating my body? Or taking a seat in my brain? Psychology students (and indeed common though unproven theories) will tell you that your mind and your brain or the same thing (remember, mind= Who you are, mind=soul in this case). Though we all know that complex processes take place in our brain, "telling" us what hurts, to move, to eat, etc...There hasn't been much proof that the essence of What we are lies in our brain. Our personalities have direct correlations to it. (Look up the strange case of Phyneus Gage) however, we cannot prove that what you think occurs in your brain, we can only prove it affects it. If you do believe your brain is where your mind is, where your soul is, then reincarnation is difficult, unless babies are getting brain transplants from corpses at the time of their birth. If, however, you can believe your soul is entirely disconnected from your physical body, then it is much easier to think logically of reincarnation. <br>  <br>  The mind-body problem has baffled philosophers for years. My attempt to explain it here is a scratch on the surface of theories, ideas, propositions, etc... that have been put forth on the topic. You may also want to look into the Ontological Argument for interesting spiritual debates.|`|29X6EEsKaa	I would say some, but it would just expose my lack of knowledge on the subject.|`|HdmlZdyHaa	flaw 3: there are more people now than people that ever lived. I mean if we all lived our lives then why is there more people? I mean in year 1 there was 100,000 people but year 5 there is 500,000 if it all the same lives that doesn't make that much sense.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	The way I understand reincarnation is this, the soul or essence of the person is reborn the life this person is born into is going to teach the soul , about the mistakes that person made in the previous life.  For example Hitler would be born a Jew, so that he could experience what it is like to be persecuted and learn  that,  persecution is awful..  A slave owner would be born a black person, so that again he could learn that being a slave is horrible.  Each subsequent life brings a lesson. <br>  Each life teaches another aspect of human  understanding, until that person has learned the lessons needed to be one with the supreme being..|`|rV1uAtt3aa	As I understand it, people who believe in reincarnation believe bad people are reincarnated as "lower" animals.<br>  <br>  I'm sure reincarnation is just as absurd as all the other mythological BS out there, but I don't know enough about it to point out anything in particular.|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	I agree esp. with #2 flaw of yours.<br>  Also we are to "learn" from our past lives yet we don't remember them, makes no sense.<br>  As a Christian reincarnation is false because Jesus died for my sins so no "karma".<br>  <br>  ?|`|nw0fqXj9aa	You'd have to assume we have souls in the first place. <br>   If we did reincarnate, what will happen to the souls once the sun expands as it runs out of fuel and burns the earth to a cinder?|`|rcPnnfmmaa	1. The Buddhists would say he spends a very, very long time as a cockroach or some other lower animal before he has a chance of working his way up to being so much as a gelded water buffalo, and then many more reincarnations after that he gets to be human. By the time he's human he's worked off his karma, in fact that's what allows him to be human again.<br>  <br>  2. Memory wipe. Each new reincarnation has the same personality but any memories of our past lives are destroyed.<br>  <br>  Personally I believe that our memories are an important part of what shapes our personalities. I have no idea what Hitler's problem was, but would Stalin have been a monster if his childhood had been different? Really we're discussing nature versus nurture.|`|12011f85da0fb54b8dd064f30c2efa9daa	Why would someone be reincarnated if they are going to be Resurrected?  You will get your own body back.<br>  <br>  I believe that those who seem to have memories of past lives are really remembering persons in history that perhaps they observed while Spirits prior to their birth into a physical body here on earth.  That would explain why so many people think they were some of the greatest people in history, because many of us were probably watching the life of those famous people.|`|Im9cwUIyaa	If Hitler is reborn as a newborn baby then how does he not deserve the bad Karma?  Do you not know what he did in his previous life? And I don't think Hitler would come back as a person.  He doesn't deserve it.<br>  <br>  Not everybody has so many past lives.  Some do and some are brand new.  People are not perfect and they make mistakes and do bad to others.  If everybody were enlightened then the world would be perfect.  But the idea of this perfect world is impossible.<br>  <br>  Eventually everybody will enter into Heaven.  I do not judge what people do or believe because it is not my place.|`|QQ2rTaPdaa	Reincarnation is FAR less flawed than other afterlife philosophies. <br>  <br>  Flaw one is with karma when applied to reincarnation and not with reincarnation its self.<br>  <br>  Flaw two isn't a flaw at all. Why would our society be more advanced just because our souls are being recycled?<br>  <br>  ~ Atheist.|`|6jAVElX7aa	would be terrible if you came back as a fly or insect wouldnt it, Man you would constantly have to watch somebody wouldnt squash you.|`|yu53u5TFaa	No evidence.

Otherwise the atheistic current which is now so influential will make one of you a tool against the other, and use the one to crush the other. And after defeating the one it will destroy the tool.

It is an expression of one’s emotion. One that brings out the emotions boiling in the heart. It is a natural phenomenon like a person claps and stands up from his place due to joy or excitement.

This curse applies to one who has anal intercourse with his wife, so how about if the woman is a stranger (non-mahram) to him? <br>  <br>  Al-Tirmidhi (135) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever has intercourse with a menstruating woman or with a woman in her back passage, or who goes to a soothsayer, has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. <br>  <br>  If a man and wife agree to anal intercourse and do not stop after being punished (with a ta’zeer punishment), then they are to be separated.|`|VN30ib8eaa	What do i consider is not important, Zinah has fixed definition in Islam.<br>  <br>  Zinah =adultery.

There is another zina such eyes'zina by not lowering his gaze and look a woman too long so his lust increases.The another zina is called hand's zina such as masturbation.Those zinas have a lighter punishment.All types of zinas will have sin because those are haram.|`|SCkhQc2Caa	Zinaa, in Arabic, means immorality, and is used with two meanings in shar’: a general meaning and a specific meaning.<br>  <br>  The general meaning includes that which carries the punishment (hadd) and that which does not carry it. Islam does not give the name of zinaa only to that which carries the punishment, which is just one of many types of zinaa. <br>  _________________________<br>  <br>  Ibn ‘Abbaas (peace be upon him) said: “I have never heard any better definition of ‘small faults’ [al-Najm 53:32] than that which Abu Hurayrah (peace be upon him) narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):<br>  <br>   ‘Allaah has decreed for every son of Adam his share of zinaa, and there is no way to escape from it. The zinaa of the eye is a glance, the zinaa of the tongue is speaking, and the zinaa of the mind is wishing and hoping; then the private part either acts upon this or it does not.’” <br>  <br>  [Reported by al-Bukhaaree, 11/26; Muslim, 4/2046].<br>  __________________________<br>  <br>  Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Zinaa is not always associated with the private part itself, but may involve other faculties such as the eyes and so on.” Ibn Battaal (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Looking and speaking are called zinaa because they lead to real zinaa.

In the context of how we use the word however, there are very specific traits that various legal and religious authorities look for to classify an organization as a cult, none of thes definitions describe Freemasonry to any extent.  <br>  <br>  Freemasonry is a fraternity. One in which men with common ideals of honor, morality, and integrity study, discuss, and apply those ideals to their lives.

When you consider the importance of who was going to be born what he was going to be in the plan of God in revealing the Messiah to the world, God was not going to fool around on this.<br>  <br>  I think that what happened to Zacharias was a bit of both divine confirmation (when John was born) and consequence of unbelief.|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	I agree with you sis.

When Paris was asked to decide who was the most beautiful among Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite, he made is decision based upon the offers they each made him, rather than their actual looks.  The Goddesses were, in theory, supremely beautiful, and thus their beauty was more within their charms and personalities.  Demeter wasn't a proper Olympian Goddess and Medusa was a monster, and a mortal.  Of all the Greek Deities, I would say that one of the Chthonic deities would have to be the most ugly.  I am thinking Eris, the Goddess of strife.  I believe she used to be cowed and foetid, and of a hideous disposition and general demeanour.|`|AA10729675	Demeter was all right.  Athena was a bit masculine.  Medusa was not a goddess. Medusa was a monster, a Gorgon. It was the furies or Erinyes.

You could help out at a daycare center by helping with the little ones. When you have your next birthday you could ask your friends to buy animal treats or do food and donate to the local humane society instead of buying gifts for you. The sky's the limit.
OTnSwNwZaa	You have a bit of a point. In the 60's, protesters actually accomplished major civil rights victories. Nowadays, people march over things like cartoons when babies are dying, people are getting killed, brutality, police brutality, etc.<br>  <br>  It's asinine really, and it has come to the point that when people protest on things that really do matter, they're not taken seriously.|`|lttxIcfvaa	'I don't understand the Ku Klux Klan and the Neo-Nazi's they never accomplish anything. Instead of hating on blacks and jews why don't they just get a job and contribute POSITIVELY to society?'<br>  <br>  We all know that, that isn't true don't we, when you look back at history you see that they achieved a lot.<br>  <br>  Nazi's ruled Germany and started a world war that claimed so many lives including 7 million Jews.<br>  <br>  The KKK made black's live in fear and also killed loads of innocent people.<br>  <br>  I don't know how you can say they didn't accomplish anything.

The 2 parties we have aren't interested in doing anything, unless the protesters happen to be asking for something that the Govt. can conveniently twist around to suit their own agenda and hurt everyone.<br>  <br>  For example the protests in the 1960's, they did stop Vietnam (after many many years) but the other "rights" things they wanted, were implemented in such a way that they have largely destroyed western society, not benefited anyone except the "dead wood" of society and we all will suffer greatly for this long term.|`|kNWevwzUaa	Yeah, why don't they RIOT and LOOT, that is the only thing that will work.

2d8a30b9f6641151f5c5048773c2626caa	The Peace Corps website has a list of requirements, and a little questionnaire you can fill out to see if you are qualified. In general, you must be over the age of 18, and there is no limit on how old you can be. You have to be a US citizen. You have to have either at least a Bachelors Degree, or relevant work experience, skills and/or a community college degree. Also, you must be cleared medically, financially (either pay off debt or make arrangements before you leave--student loans can be deferred, and part of Perkins loans can be forgiven for each year of completed service), and dentally. Further, you must pass a background check--a criminal record will not automatically disqualify you, but it depends on what is in the record. These are the only hard and fast requirements. Other things that might affect your application--medical history/ongoing conditions, volunteer experience, knowledge of another language (helpful but not required), willingness to devote 27 months to service in another country, and flexibility. Check out the Peace Corps website at www.peacecorps.gov and the "Am I Qualified" questionnaire at <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shel..." rel="nofollow">http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shel...</a><br>  <br>  With my group, the average time from application to acceptance varied from 5 months to 20 months (longer timeframe for medical condition clearance).  We lost only 5 of 30 volunteers during training, and homesickness was the culprit in 3 cases, with medical issues the reason for the other 2.  Nobody failed to achieve the required language level after three months at site, unlike what the other volunteer's experience was--they give you a lot of chances to make sure you can achieve it.  Flexibility and patience are both really good virtues in this case. Good luck!|`|PSiUMDqwaa	There is an official website, which will tell you only that you must be at least 18 and a US citizen.  Additional requirements vary by country of destination, job description, and so on.   That still doesn't tell you much, does it?  Just bear in mind that the pool of available volunteers are mostly recent graduates of 4-year colleges or universities, and that the Peace Corps administrators to some extent have to tailor their job requirements to this fact.  You can get in with practically any kind of degree from any accredited school.<br>  If they "invite" you to join, they will put you through a kind of boot camp in your host country, which lasts about three months.  This is designed to weed out people who can't learn a new language, suffer unduly from homesickness, or otherwise demonstrate an inability to adjust to living in third world conditions.  About half of the people in my "pre-service training" group were sent home, mostly because they couldn't pass the language tests.  I don't know if this is a typical rate of attrition, but it's something you should ask your Peace Corps recruiter about. <br>  Aside from lack of language ability, the Peace Corps is most likely to reject you for health problems.  They don't want you to die on them because your cancer came roaring back while you were deep in the boonies, hundreds of miles from a hospital.  Presumably you don't want that to happen either.  If you think you might have a disqualifying medical condition, bring it up when they first interview you.  You don't want to go through training, get your posting, and then get "medevac-ed" out.  <br>  Hope this helped, and good luck.

The British royalty have a mainly ceremonial role nowadays.|`|l82F5puuaa	The present monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, has reigned since 6 February 1952. She and her immediate family undertake various official, ceremonial and representational duties. As a constitutional monarch, the Queen is limited to non-partisan functions such as bestowing honours. Though the ultimate executive authority over the government of the United Kingdom is still by and through the monarch's royal prerogative, in practice these powers are only used according to laws enacted in Parliament or within the constraints of convention and precedent.|`|g4lLX3iaaa	Her role is to try her best to keep the country and the commonwealth united.A role that she fills admirably.Even republicans,not the uneducated,unwashed irksome oik variety that mouth off on here but the ones with intelligence,admire and respect her for the work she does for the whole of the U.K.As a constitutional monarch,her power is limited to advice but,as she has had such a long reign,her advice is sought after and respected.She greets heads of state and diplomats and awards honours,freeing the Prime Minister to concentrate on the running of the country.|`|Iqp3ZUAlaa	The Queen opens and dissolves,closes Parliament.She calls for general elections and she appoints the Prime Ministers.The Queen signs parliamentary bills into action.Because she is a constitutional monarch,the Queen must work with the elected government and not act independently,but if an occasion were ever to arise that the Queen felt her realm was not being served and was endangered by Parliament,then she could act on her own.<br>  <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandGovernment/QueenandGovernment.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Queena...</a><br>  "As Head of State The Queen has to remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters, unable to vote or stand for election. <br>  <br>  But The Queen does have important ceremonial and formal roles in relation to the Government of the UK.<br>  <br>  The formal phrase 'Queen in Parliament' is used to describe the British legislature, which consists of the Sovereign, the House of Lords and the House of Commons.

SfGyzMSFaa	My family moved from eastern Ohio to central Florida in 1967, when I was 9 years old. Most of my cousins, aunts, and uncles still live in Ohio. I enjoy living here, but it is very different than Ohio, and so you need to consider how well you can adapt to changes. There are great things and hard things about living here; and other things that are just different-neither good nor bad.<br>  <br>  Minus: Yes, the economy should be a huge consideration, imo. Our unemployment rate has jumped nearly 3 percentage points over the last 18 months. It isn't just the unskilled jobs that are taking hits; professionals are having a tough time finding work too. Should you decide to move here, I highly recommend that you save up at least 6 months living expenses and be able to buy individual health insurance policies to carry you until you and your husband can find work.<br>  <br>  Plus: you work in Healthcare. There are great jobs available in the healthcare field. The East Central Florida area still has plentiful work for experienced healthcare workers. I live in the metropolitan Orlando area; in Orange County. Other counties in the metro area are Seminole, Lake, Osceola, and possibly Marion, Volusia and Brevard counties. Check out "Orlando Health" and "Florida Hospital": these are our two largest hospital systems. There is a huge medical core being developed just north of Orlando International Airport, near Lake Nona, the Burnham Institute is building a research facility, M.D. Anderson cancer research and treatment center is moving there, Nemours is building a children's hospital, the Veterans Administration (VA) is building a hospital there, and the University of Central Florida is building at Medical School there. <br>  <br>  Minus: Salaries and benefits here may not be comparable here to what you had 'back home'. Be sure to check out salaries before you decide to move here. We are a 'right to work state'; so unions do exist here but not to the extent they do 'up north'. <br>  <br>  Plus: There is no state income tax here.<br>  <br>  Minus: It is becoming difficult to obtain homeowners and other property insurance here. The damage from hurricanes, tropical storms with flooding, wildfires, and tornados has caused our premiums to go very high, and some properties are not able to find private insurance and must use the very expensive state insurance funds. My husband and I have begun looking for new homeowner's insurance because our insurer, State Farm, wants to pull out of the state.....we've been with State Farm with this house since 1981.<br>  <br>  Plus: Home prices and rent have become more reasonable. Two years ago speculators drove up the prices to ridiculous heights. Now, there are foreclosures and newly built houses sitting empty. However; there are many stable,  more established neighborhoods that are wonderful. The prices may not be as low as they are in the midwest, but they are more reasonable than they were two years ago. Try to avoid developments with many empty house or foreclosures; look for older neighborhoods.<br>  <br>  The population here is fairly diverse; native Floridians, long time residents like me, and newcomers from all over the world. Some areas are highly transient; people move in and out frequently and there is little sense of community. My area is more established;  a few rental homes but mostly people who live here for many years. It is likely that you will hear many languages being spoken; especially if you work in healthcare. Most people expect to hear spanish being spoken; but there are many others: Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Haitian Creole, French, Portuguese, etc. Many students in our public schools come from families whose native language is not English, there were well over 100 languages counted in the last survey. This makes it challenging here sometimes, but I love it, the mix can be quite fun.<br>  <br>  Minus: Heat, humidity, lightning, insects, over crowded roads, limited public transportation, and many animals that can become pests.<br>  <br>  Plus: Today it will be in the 60's all day, with clear blue skies. I think it is lovely here. The plants and wildlife here are beautiful. There are lakes, fresh water springs, beaches within a one hour drive, rivers, and parks. There is lots to do here; you can be as busy or as lazy as you wish.<br>  <br>  You might want to consider spending some time here before you move. Take a couple of weeks, have a realtor take you around, schedule some job interviews, shop in local grocery stores and farmers markets, check out property taxes and the cost of water and other utilities. Some people love it here, and others do not. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|KWwW7N49aa	Don't do it.  Take some of the advice of others and just rent an apartment for about 3 months before you decide to sell your home.  A better place to choose is something like New Bern, NC.  I think you will like it.  That way you can be close to Florida for visits.  Pray about it and do more research before making the plunge.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.topretirements.com/reviews/North_Carolina/New_Bern.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.topretirements.com/reviews/No...</a>|`|a4LWildhaa	No way ! I have a brother and a sister who gave up trying to sell their homes. Been trying to get out of Florida for at least two years. Reason? Hurricanes, tornados and illegal aliens.

If you aren't familiar with death like humidity, you won't like it.|`|nwnILcEAaa	Government retirement classes caution future retirees to try living somewhere like Florida for a year before committing to buying a home there. Many things you experience living there aren't apparent in vacation time, but you need to know what you are getting in to.|`|1NO10YfPaa	As a native Floridian, I live here because it is home and because my family is here.  But I have to tell you that many people who move here from elsewhere are not happy because Florida is different from the place they moved from.  If you move here, do not expect it to be the midwest, because it isn't.  And vacationing in a place is different from living there.<br>  <br>  Also considering that the entire nation is in the midst of a recession/depression and Florida is especially hard hit.  Don't expect to find a job all that easily.<br>  <br>  Insurance rates are astronomical on account of the hurricanes.  Live in certain areas and you could loose everything you own in one night and count yourself lucky simply because you are still alive.<br>  <br>  Also I am not sure that it is a healthier climate.  How do you deal with oppressive, humid heat on a continuous basis for weeks on end?  That is what it will be in summer.  A lot of northerners can't handle it.<br>  <br>  And that is saying nothing of the bugs and the snakes and the other critters that get into everything!<br>  <br>  Also, as you get older, IMO it is not wise to move away from family.  Have known a number of seniors who have regretted this.|`|bmoCpcdraa	yes move, i've been in the south for the last 10 years i,came back up north for the past 6 months and all my family members look so much older , cause people from the north have dry skin all the time,and i haven't had a cold in 10 years, people get sicker up here,the bad weather maks the roads full of pot holes and rust on your cars, i pay twice the price for insurence and i pay 3 times as much for plates for my car, the food is all about the same price and the rent is all the same ,the better the place the more the rent , and if i get in a tornado they give me a 20 min. warrning, if i get in a hurricane they give you a 3 day notice, so i will be going back down south almost broke as soon as i can,people live up north cause they have family or affraide of change, i hope i helped ,,, and the electric co. is only 160 dollor deposite with a payment plan , and the power is so much cheaper each month i never paid more then 200 a month ,but here in indiana i paid 400 deposite and about 350 a month ,for a small trailer and my heat on 68 , my bones hurt from the cold, and you can make friends anywere .so in a few months when school is out im going to take my child and go stay at a camp ground and find a crap job and go from there.cause i missed family and came back and now the new were off and they don't visit as often and i can't waite to go back to where i can have a garden start in the 1st of may and end the 1st week of nov.  i hope i helped . and every year around oct. the peacons fall you can pick them up all day long for free off sidewalks in front of homes for rent and from schools and churches and parks and sell them to the local peacon factories or eat them, you don't pay 5 dollors a pound, like up here,fruits and juice are a lot cheaper,, hope i helped,,,,,,i liked alabama  and mississippi better then flordia'flordia has a lot of sand in the ground ,which makes a garden harder , and hurricanes are more active, but i would go up a little about to the middle of alabama or missippi.|`|syIp6d2Naa	I can think of one real strong word. Hurricanes. I know you've probably put up with tornado's and blizzards but a hurricane is a different entity all together. I would if you could afford to go rent for a few months without selling your home I think it would be a good idea. Visiting a place and living there are way different. Also you may be in a field in demand but changing jobs will put you back on the low man on the totem pole and subject to being laid off and the economy is so bad right now no one is safe. I wish you luck either way, but you could not get me to live in FL if they gave the state. I do live in Hurricane country but I lived in FL and hated every sticky bug infested minute of it. The darn mosquito's are so big they have to put out landing lights for them and the humidity is miserable.|`|vQJPRjhVaa	This is EXACTLY what we are doing.  We too live in the midwest and have been planning for this for awhile.  I can't give you the local perspective but will answer the question, yes you should move to Florida!

Best wishes and good luck!|`|VpOGcG4maa	Don't sell your house......If you can move to Florida rent for a while get jobs see if you like it...<br>  We know so many retired friends that made that move to a location they thought they would love and just wish they could go home but sold their homes and can never go back....|`|1yxPfC0Jaa	Don't jump too quick, compare many different places.  Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Tennessee.|`|34090baae43bdcb8c4c4335f475f6aa1aa	The choice of course is yours.<br>  This is just my opinion.<br>  For my part, I lived in West Palm Beach, Lake Worth and Royal Palm Beach for over 25 years and was very happy to leave.  I enjoy my seasons, and got tired of the green, green, and more green.  Also, very busy there and more moving in all the time.  The humidity was also a factor for me, taking a shower and feeling as though I took another one on my way to the car.<br>  Hurricanes were also an issue.<br>  That said, we are all different, keep in mind that there are other areas you could move to without bone chilling winters, and still be able to do many activities.<br>  In the end, only you two can make the decision, as long as you have each other, I'm sure you'll be happy no matter where you end up.<br>  Good Luck to you both.|`|AA10240238	Minus:  The bugs.  Forever bugs.  I could not get them out of my house.  Woke up one night when one crawled across my face.  And the love bugs.  Iowa, where I am by choice, has some snakes, but Fla has poisonous ones.  And if you are not familiar, you don't know which are dangerous.  The love bugs... they are everywhere and will eat the paint right off your car.<br>  <br>  Minus:  The overcrowding.  My son and I went down to check out the Tampa area.

m2jeeo4Laa	He was honest about what he wanted...sex.  If you want a commitment with it, then you aren't going to get it with him.  It's your choice.   Having sex with him isn't going to make him want you make.  It will actually make him think, I don't have to be committed to him to have sex, and he won't commit again.|`|tJGbfxdgaa	you are a freak.<br>  you are like 12 years old..|`|Vu726Q18aa	just tell him no love no sex|`|HtKKcq98aa	Since you do not want this sort of  relationship with your boyfriend you need to tell him exactly plain as day that you do not simply want just sex, you want love. If sex out of a being in a relationship is not your thing then you need to make it crystal clear to the boy. Perhaps he might have feelings for you but if he just wants to be friends with benefits then there is a good possibility that he is chasing someone else while he's sleeping with you. Now i could give you a riveting paragraph about catching STDS and safe sex and how monogamy is the best thing in the world but i don't have the time or the energy to do so. <br>  That being said you should be direct about what  it is that you want with him, if he doesn't  feel the same way then ask him why he doesn't.|`|3RQkgTSOaa	Yes, he's just using you for your parts. In case you didn't know, the whole "FwB" is built on the premise that there IS no love... just sex. That also what "no strings attached" means. I'm afraid if it's love you're looking for, Ben is the WRONG person to deliver the goods. Dump him and move on.|`|eGtZXgRHaa	Friends with benefit are basically f*ckfriends... So yeah, he's looking for sex, I'm sorry...<br>  <br>  But it might be because you 2 broke up ? Ask him to be back in a relationship if that's what you want..|`|WNIL4sLiaa	Sometimes friends with fringe benefits is better than the commitment and often this does lead into a true relationship.<br>  He was honest with you and you are honest to say it feels good. It's your choice to either tell him you don't want the fringe benefits unless there's a relationship and look for someone who does, or take what you can get in hopes of him coming around to your way of thinking.|`|xFg6y1qEaa	At least he is being honest about what he does and doesn't want. That is a good thing in any type relationship. If you choose to just be f++k buddies, you better be completely over him and ok with the fact that he will be with other guys. It shouldn't be an attempt to hang on. If you're not, you'll get hurt again.|`|sco7IP3gaa	That is so tough. I know because I was recently in the same situation. You are not just a sex toy.

One of the benefits of being Roman Catholic is that we are not obligated to accept creationism, evolution, or intelligent design as the be-all, end-all of truth.<br>  <br>  Since no one was there and can prove what happened, it only makes sense to say that there are many possibilities. And trust me, being open-minded and accepting of all the options makes for a much more peaceful way of life -- on Darwin Day, the 4th of July, or any other day.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Archbishop Gianfranco Ravasi, head of the Pontifical Council for Culture, said the idea of evolution could be traced to St Augustine and St Thomas Aquinas.<br>  The 4th century theologian St Augustine had "never heard the term evolution, but knew that big fish eat smaller fish" and forms of life had been transformed "slowly over time". Aquinas made similar observations in the Middle Ages.<br>  Darwins theories are "totally incompatible with a religious vision of reality".<br>  <br>  Yes the Vatican is celebrating and so is the Anglican Church.<br>  <br>  So blame your American born fundamentalists for their idiotic adherence to Biblical Creationism.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	We say, 'Happy Darwin Day!!!!!!!!!!'|`|1o3OqSioaa	What day?

GhsqaXsdaa	I believe in happy endings x]|`|nxexH4OMaa	thats why there called TALES!!|`|x7qtyglzaa	A fairy tale is a fictional story that may feature folkloric characters such as fairies, goblins, elves, trolls, giants, and talking animals, and usually enchantments, often involving a far-fetched sequence of events. In modern-day parlance, the term is also used to describe something blessed with princesses, as in "fairy tale ending" (a happy ending)[1] or "fairy tale romance", though not all fairy tales end happily. (The Brothers Grimm had especially dark stories, very 'grim' as their name ironically shows.) Colloquially, a "fairy tale" or "fairy story" can also mean any far-fetched story. Fairy tales mostly attract young children since they easily understand the archetypal characters in the story.|`|5ASRK3sDaa	I believe in books that contain the fairy tales.|`|AA10356839	No, they are just for small children.|`|EUcdqY0Vaa	i believe in fairies! but idk bout all of the fairy tales!|`|WoxA3ilFaa	Although their all good fun I'm not sure how much truth there is too them. That being said, when it comes to believing certain stories I like to go by a saying that I picked up: nothing comes from nothing. Perhaps once upon a time something similar happened but no doubt over time (like all good stories) the facts were twisted and became tales as the story became more fantastical to make it more interesting.|`|AlJ557gHaa	no.  that's the reason there called tales.  they are tall tales.|`|HEDSOHq1aa	fairytales, like the bible?|`|Mqga8EWsaa	I LOVE them!

lhhgXNxRaa	Día de los Muertos (The Day of the Dead) is a holiday celebrated mainly in Latin America and by Latinos (and others) living in the United States and Canada. The holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died. The celebration occurs on the 1st and 2nd of November, in connection with the Catholic holy days of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day which take place on those days. Traditions include building private altars honoring the deceased, using sugar skulls, marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts.<br>  <br>  Scholars trace the origins of the modern holiday to indigenous observances dating back thousands of years, and to an Aztec festival dedicated to a goddess called Mictecacihuatl (known in English as "The Lady of the Dead").<br>  <br>  Many people believe that during the Day of the Dead, it is easier for the souls of the departed to visit the living. People will go to cemeteries to communicate with the souls of the departed, and will build private altars, containing the favorite foods and beverages, and photos and memorabilia, of the departed. The intent is to encourage visits by the souls, so that the souls will hear the prayers and the comments of the living directed to them. Celebrations can take a humorous tone, as celebrants remember funny events and anecdotes about the departed.[3]<br>  <br>  Plans for the day are made throughout the year, including gathering the goods to be offered to the dead. During the period of November 1 and November 2, families usually clean and decorate graves;[2] most visit the cemeteries where their loved ones are buried and decorate their graves with ofrendas, or offerings, which often include orange marigolds called "cempasúchitl" (originally named cempoalxochitl, Nahuatl for "twenty (i.e., many) flowers"). In modern Mexico this name is sometimes replaced with the term "Flor de Muerto" ("Flower of the Dead"). These flowers are thought to attract souls of the dead to the offerings.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_...</a>|`|FFEV7nPpaa	it means day of the dead in spanish..........in spanish culture  death is celebrated, and thats all it is a death celebration basically....what my spanish teacher said last year.

He held up the Matzah which is traditionally eaten at the Seder, as leavened bread is forbidden beginning at sundown for a week, and said "this is my body".<br>  <br>  when you take communion during Mass, you are recreating that moment.<br>  <br>  I actually know of some churches that use proper kosher Matzah for their Mass.|`|EAix5Av9aa	Mass involves  wafer bread in wine. <br>   The partaking of the bread of Christ's body by the wafer and wine symbolizes the blood.<br>    Other bread and wineor grape juice also similarly are ones we  poartake to remmebr that God loves us and gave Himself for us.

l82F5puuaa	Elizabeth was lamented, but many people were relieved at her death. Expectations of King James were high, and at first they were met, with the ending of the war against Spain in 1604 and lower taxes. Until the death of Robert Cecil in 1612, the government ran along much the same lines as before. James's rule, however, became unpopular when he turned state affairs over to court favourites, and in the 1620s there was a nostalgic revival of the cult of Elizabeth. Elizabeth was praised as a heroine of the Protestant cause and the ruler of a golden age. James was depicted as a Catholic sympathiser, presiding over a corrupt court. The triumphalist image that Elizabeth had cultivated towards the end of her reign, against a background of factionalism and military and economic difficulties, was taken at face value and her reputation inflated. Godfrey Goodman, Bishop of Gloucester, recalled: "When we had experience of a Scottish government, the Queen did seem to revive. Then was her memory much magnified." Elizabeth's reign became idealised as a time when crown, church and parliament had worked in constitutional balance.<br>  Elizabeth I, painted by an unknown artist after 1620, during the first revival of interest in her reign. Time sleeps on her right and Death looks over her left shoulder; two putti hold the crown above her head.<br>  <br>  The picture of Elizabeth painted by her Protestant admirers of the early 17th century has proved lasting and influential. Her memory was also revived during the Napoleonic Wars, when the nation again found itself on the brink of invasion. In the Victorian era, the Elizabethan legend was adapted to the imperial ideology of the day, and in the mid-20th century, Elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat. Historians of that period, such as J. E. Neale and A. L. Rowse, interpreted Elizabeth's reign as a golden age of progress.<br>  <br>  Recent historians, however, have taken a more complicated view of Elizabeth. Her reign is famous for the defeat of the Armada, and for successful raids against the Spanish, such as those on Cádiz in 1587 and 1596, but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea, such as the "Islands voyage" to the Azores, of 1597 (where Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex defied the Queen's orders, and pursued the Spanish treasure fleet before ensuring that the Spanish navy was out of action). Elizabeth's problems in Ireland also stain her record. Rather than as a brave defender of the Protestant nations against Spain and the Habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. She offered minimal aid to foreign Protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.<br>  <br>  Elizabeth established an English church that helped shape a national identity and remains in place today. Those who praised her later as a Protestant heroine overlooked her refusal to drop all Catholic practices. Historians note that in her day, strict Protestants regarded the Acts of Settlement and Uniformity of 1559 as a compromise. In fact, Elizabeth believed that faith was personal and did not wish, as Francis Bacon put it, to "make windows into men's hearts and secret thoughts".<br>  <br>  Despite Elizabeth's largely defensive foreign policy, her reign raised England's status abroad. "She is only a woman, only mistress of half an island," marvelled Pope Sixtus V, "and yet she makes herself feared by Spain, by France, by the Empire, by all". Under Elizabeth, the nation gained a new self-confidence and sense of sovereignty, as Christendom fragmented. Elizabeth was the first Tudor to recognise that a monarch ruled by popular consent. She therefore always worked with parliament and advisers she could trust to tell her the truth—a style of government that her Stuart successors failed to follow. Some historians have called her lucky; she believed that God was protecting her. Priding herself on being "mere English", Elizabeth trusted in God, honest advice, and the love of her subjects for the success of her rule. In a prayer, she offered thanks to God that:<br>  <br>      [At a time] when wars and seditions with grievous persecutions have vexed almost all kings and countries round about me, my reign hath been peacable, and my realm a receptacle to thy afflicted Church. The love of my people hath appeared firm, and the devices of my enemies frustrate.|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	Queen Elizabeth I did not "MESS UP" she made unsuccessful decisions.|`|NYU37jfGaa	In 'Elizabeth I' David Loades writes:<br>  <br>  'She failed to deal with two issues of crucial importance which were to derail the regimes of her successors.  Having encouraged the gentry to adopt a higher and higher profile in government, she failed to find a satisfactory definition of the constitutional relationship between crown, lords and commons, although several models were offered to her by William Cecil in the course of her reign.  By refusing to define it sheprotected her prerogative from formal limitation, but left it vulnerable to attack, as was already becoming apparent before she died.  Secondly, she conspicuously failed to tackle theproblem of inadequate revenue.  by muddling along, and improvising from hand to mouth, she managed to survive; but the consequence was that nobody faced the fact that the crown needed a regular and substantial taxation income, even to conduct its normal peacetime operations, never mind to wage war.  It was as much ignorance as extravagance or ill-will that caused the financial crises of the early Stuarts and for that ignorance Elizabeth was to blame.  Her inability to act promptly and decisevly was thus more damaging at home than it was abroad.  It was caused directly by her fear that parliament, and particularly the House of Commons, would be empowered to exercise a measure of control which she believed should belong to herself alone.<br>  <br>  Elizabeth chose for herself  the mtto Semper Eadem (Always the Same) and in most respects that consistency served her well, both as aperson and as a ruler.  It also meant an unwillingness, even an inability, to embrace change.  It could be said that she was so concerned to remain in charge of the ship, and to avoid the icebergs of Spanish and papal hostility, that she failed to spot the other unobtrusive rocks lying in her path.  She was not on the bridge when the ship went down,'

Since I'm considered high risk  I have mine ever 2 years instead of 5 years. The first 2 I had were in a doctor's office, before they had the good sense to use the twilight sleep. I have had 2 children, 2 brain surgeries and 2 carotid artery bypasses and I can honestly say they were not as painful as those first 2 colonoscopies. I was wide awake so I got a glimpse of the instrument used and it looked like a rotor rooter as big as a garden hose. Since then all mine have been with the twilight sleep and except for the preparation, which was the same as the ones without the twilight sleep, it is almost a pleasure. I do agree that we are lucky that colon cancer, if you get regular conoloscopies, can be cured. My poor daddy really suffered before he died.
d6bUhFnjaa	You know the jews was dedicated to Jehovah and yet they did things they thought was good and thought they had the best religion on earth and even believe that God would protect them from anything, but they forgot the covenant had conditions and they had to meet All the conditions first, Religions today are doing the same thing, They side with the world on many issues and even pray for their country's solders to have victory in defeating other country's and still preach John 3:16, they have their own Versions of the bible and want people to believe that it is a true translation of the original manuscripts. such as paying tithes or 10% of your money to the church, but no-one goes to the alter and make sacrifices with their first fruits, Many Church's teach that all you have to do is believe and give them your money so they can help others believe and you will go to heaven, If this was true, then what do we need the rest of the bible for? God did give us more bible then what the jews had to work with, that is, Jesus himself has taught us many many wonderful ways to worship God, Just being a good moral citizen isn't what he taught, he taught us not to be worm wood covered in vernier but to follow his ways and become solid oak or cherry with a fine polished finish, something wormwood wouldn't understand.|`|HItbioaMaa	There are good people in all religions. People who will listen to someone else's viewpoint without getting upset or angry. Take Jehovah's Witnesses for example. We hear many different religious ideas every day. We know these beliefs offend God deeply and this in turn, hurts us too. However, we don't yell or scream obscenities at them. Many of us were blinded by Satan into thinking that what we once believed when we were part of Christendom, was true. So we know what it feels like when someone challenges our beliefs.<br>  There is no reason whatsoever that a Catholic, Jew , Muslim, Protestant, Atheist, Baptist, etc., cannot have a logical, calm and peaceful discussion about the subject of religion with one of Jehovah's Witnesses. We respect all others as we want to be respected, not just the good people we meet.|`|6jAVElX7aa	The Bible also mentions that satan can transform himself into an angel of light. So I suppose ministers and preachers can transform themselves into saying their message is true, But there is only one truth which Christ Jesus taught us, which is Jesus said. "I am the way, the truth and the light, No one can come unto the Father except through me."  So I dont believe every priest or minister always have the exact true message of the gospel, unless Christ has called them to bring the message of salvation.|`|atfKCzmPaa	HOW TO IDENTIFY THE TRUE RELIGION<br>  5 How can ‘the road to life’ be found? Jesus said that the true religion would be evident in the lives of the people who practice it. “By their fruits you will recognize them,” he said. “Every good tree produces fine fruit.” (Matthew 7:16, 17) In other words, those who practice the true religion would be recognized by their beliefs and their conduct. Although they are not perfect and they make mistakes, true worshipers as a group seek to do God’s will. <br>  6 God’s servants base their teachings on the Bible. The Bible itself says: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man [or woman] of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.” (2 Timothy 3:16, 17) <br>  7 Jesus Christ set the proper example by basing his teachings on God’s Word. In prayer to his heavenly Father, he said: “Your word is truth.” (John 17:17) Jesus believed the Word of God, and everything he taught harmonized with the Scriptures. Jesus often said: “It is written.” (Matthew 4:4, 7, 10) Similarly, God’s people today do not teach their own ideas. <br>  8 Those who practice the true religion worship only Jehovah and make his name known. Jesus declared: “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.” (Matthew 4:10) Thus, God’s servants worship no one other than Jehovah. This worship includes letting people know what the name of the true God is and what he is like. Psalm 83:18 states: “You, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” Jesus set the pattern in helping others to get to know God, as he said in prayer: “I have made your name manifest to the men you gave me out of the world.” (John 17:6) <br>  9 God’s people show genuine, unselfish love for one another. Jesus said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.” (John 13:35) The early Christians had such love for one another. Godly love overcomes racial, social, and national barriers and draws people together in an unbreakable bond of true brotherhood. (Colossians 3:14) Members of false religions do not have such a loving brotherhood. How do we know that? They kill one another because of national or ethnic differences. The Bible states: “The children of God and the children of the Devil are evident by this fact: Everyone who does not carry on righteousness does not originate with God, neither does he who does not love his brother. . . . We should have love for one another; not like Cain, who originated with the wicked one and slaughtered his brother.”—1 John 3:10-12; 4:20, 21.<br>  11 True Christians accept Jesus Christ as God’s means of salvation. The Bible says: “There is no salvation in anyone else, for there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.” (Acts 4:12). In addition, Jesus is God’s appointed King in the heavenly Kingdom that will rule the entire earth. And God requires that we obey Jesus and apply his teachings if we want everlasting life. That is why the Bible states: “He that exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; he that disobeys the Son will not see life.”—John 3:36.<br>  12 True worshipers are no part of the world. When on trial before the Roman ruler Pilate, Jesus said: “My kingdom is no part of this world.” (John 18:36) No matter what country they live in, Jesus’ true followers are subjects of his heavenly Kingdom and thus maintain strict neutrality in the world’s political affairs. They take no part in its conflicts.And while God’s true worshipers are neutral regarding politics, they are law-abiding. <br>  13 Jesus’ true followers preach that God’s Kingdom is mankind’s only hope. Jesus foretold: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.” (Matthew 24:14) Instead of encouraging people to look to human rulers to solve their problems, true followers of Jesus Christ proclaim God’s heavenly Kingdom as the only hope for mankind. (Psalm 146:3) Jesus taught us to pray for that perfect government when he said: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (Matthew 6:10) <br>  14 On the basis of what we have just considered, ask yourself: ‘What religious group bases all its teachings on the Bible and makes known Jehovah’s name? What group practices godly love, exercises faith in Jesus, is no part of the world, and proclaims that God’s Kingdom is the only real hope for mankind? Of all the religious groups on earth, which one meets all these requirements?’ The facts clearly show that it is Jehovah’s Witnesses.—Isaiah 43:10-12.|`|AA11135281	I'd rather phrase it that there is something to be learned from every religion as they are expressions of human thought and human desire and our attempts to understand the universe and our place in it.|`|NLinPsyhaa	Yes there is some truth in all religions.

He observed that almost all the aid groups that stayed on in Hurricane Katrina-ravaged parts of New Orleans long after the first wave of relief workers had left "have a religious origin and character," whereas, "notable by their absence are teams from rationalist societies, free thinkers' clubs and atheists' associations. The sort of people who not only scoff at religion's intellectual absurdity but also regard it as a positive force for evil." From his observations not just of Salvation Army workers and other Christians in New Orleans but also in his constituency when he was in politics, Hattersley concluded, "The only possible conclusion is that faith comes with a packet of moral imperatives that, while they do not condition the attitude of all believers, influence enough of them to make them morally superior to atheist like me. The truth may make us free. But it has not made us as admirable as the average captain in the Salvation Army."|`|LZWZXPOeaa	Boy, is your initial question different than your exposition!<br>  <br>  Without really researching this, I can still confidently say, that yes,  there is some good in all religions.<br>  <br>  But, is that sufficient?

Why is their contradictory interpretation of a couple of verses more important and right than dozens of other verses? <br>  <br>  Remember satan was Gods most Beautiful angel, he orchestrated His vast symphonys of Heavenly worship and Gods supreme angel..thus why he thought he was better and equal to God,  The Lord cast him down with all who followed(demons) his dominions cannot grow in number and he cannot be that of which God consists..... For thousands of years, philosophers have defined God’s Nature with three words: omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient. To the philosopher, omnipotent means God is all-powerful. He can do anything. Omnipresent means God is everywhere. Omniscient means God knows everything. satan is none of these and can only work within this realm with certain rules.  God has no rules only laws of principle. He is ALWAYS JUST and ALWAYS RIGHTEOUS.  so I feel you must ask yourself thoroughly if these religions work on these Two principles.......Alway sworship His name you need not a title on religion to do so,to follow so, or grow so.

AA11232725	So I clicked on your link and read some of the results. None of them showed any proof that an ancient skeleton had come from a previous less "evolved" life form or was on it's way to becoming a more "evolved" life form. <br>  <br>  Variations within a species do not demonstrate that a reptile became a bird or a mammal. One species that was mentioned was the Archaeopteryx. This fossil is claimed to be "transitional" because it has teeth but it's teeth are like the teeth that some birds have today and they are not reptilian. Besides that, fossils have been found of birds that are clearly birds dated 75 million years before this fossil is dated.<br>  <br>  All of the so called "transitional" fossils are just animals that shared characteristics with other animals and have gone extinct. There is no clear line of fossils showing that a transition from one phyla of creatures to another has ever taken place.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	They really do not want to understand.  <br>  They want more to retain their beliefs.<br>  Its not complicated.<br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish|`|AA11690436	Well, what boggles my mind is that fossil evidence wasn't the primary source for ideas about natural selection.  Both Darwin, when he studied the wildlife of the Galapagos Islands, and Alfred Wallace, as he studied Malaysian beetles, were confronted with astonishing bio-diversity, as well as being well aware of the evolution that human selection could create.  In the few centuries before the nineteenth when agriculturalists and animal husbandry began to become systematized, it became apparent that we could transform wild plants and animals into forms beyond all recognition with their wild progenitors.  Surely, something similar must be at work in nature to create the astonishing range of plants and animals in the world.  Fossils were secondary to Darwin, even in terms of geology.  He was far more concerned with geological evidence for time scales that would permit natural selection to occur.  Believe it or not, rather than having my students read selections from Darwin's Origin of Species, I have them read selections from his journals, where we can see him wrestling with enormity of the implications of natural selection and a world old enough for it work within.  It's far more persuasive than looking at fossils.|`|Yz8Ysagiaa	Different variations in skeletons can be seen in any species at any time.

The idea that these creatures walked the same earth that we live on intrigues us. However, the fact that they lived has virtually no effect upon our practical lives.<br>  <br>  Some might say that dinosaurs were important in providing fossil fuels (which products were important even in biblical events. <br>  <br>  Even the fossil fuel argument is not a strong one, since the overwhelming majority of oil came from the bodies of plants and trees - not dinosaurs. <br>  <br>  Most of those who complain about the lack of dinosaurs in the Bible are looking at the natural world from an evolutionary perspective, in which mankind is just an evolutionary fluke - a recent upstart who doesn't figure prominently in the overall evolutionary history of the earth. <br>  <br>  Even from an naturalistic perspective, dinosaurs are a failed evolutionary experiment that couldn't compete with their mammalian descendents.|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	I can show you, over & over again that the color GREEN comes from mixing blue and yellow.

Fundamentalists want to believe that an old Hebrew book can be taken literally, and make fools out of themselves when they try to use pseudoscience to "prove" their creation myth is a literal account.<br>  <br>  For the person who does not know what a scientific theory is: A scientific theory is not the same as the layman definition, which is an opinion. A scientific theory has evidence and has been proven to be true. After several hundred years, a theory that has not been disproved is then called a "Law." A hypothesis is not even formed until there is a preponderance of evidence in favor of the hypothesis. I had no idea the yokels still tried to pull "the theory gambit" anymore. Let's chalk that up to ignorance.

As am I.<br>  <br>  Is Satan perhaps only the evil within people?<br>  <br>  Job 1:6-12 and 2:1-7 tell about conversations between Jehovah God and Satan. If Satan were the evil in a person, the evil in this case would have to be in Jehovah. But that is in complete disagreement with what the Bible tells us about Jehovah as being One “in whom there is no unrighteousness.” (Ps. 92:15; Rev. 4:8) It is noteworthy that the Hebrew text uses the expression has·Sa·tan′ (the Satan) in the accounts in Job, showing that reference is being made to the one who is outstandingly the resister of God.—See also Zechariah 3:1,?2, footnote in NW Reference edition.<br>  <br>  Luke 4:1-13 reports that the Devil endeavored to tempt Jesus to do his bidding. The account relates statements made by the Devil and answers given by Jesus. Was Jesus there being tempted by evil within himself? Such a view does not harmonize with the Bible’s description of Jesus as being sinless. (Heb. 7:26; 1?Pet. 2:22) Although at John 6:70 the Greek word di·a′bo·los′ is used to describe a bad quality that had developed in Judas Iscariot, in Luke 4:3 the expression ho di·a′bo·los (the Devil) is used, thus designating a particular person.<br>  <br>  Is blaming the Devil just a device used in an effort to escape from responsibility for bad conditions?<br>  <br>  Some people blame the Devil for what they themselves do. In contrast, the Bible shows that humans often bear much of the blame for the badness they experience, whether at the hands of other humans or as a result of their own conduct. (Eccl. 8:9; Gal. 6:7) Yet, the Bible does not leave us ignorant of the existence and devices of the superhuman foe who has brought so much grief to mankind. It shows how we can get out from under his control.|`|KRTPJP2baa	Anybody who believes in God should also believe in the Devil, both are just as illogical.|`|qJXdyUY3aa	The Devil is alive and well.

If we give into it and sin, it's all our fault. Not his.<br>  <br>  I don't blame anyone but myself for my actions. When I do good, it's me and when I do bad, it's me.

Ps9eOIchaa	I totally know what you are talking about.Some people on here will ask racist questions that are obviously racist and stereotypical,but when called racist,they get mad.I don't understand it.If you know your beliefs are right and aren't bad,then you would defend them,and embrace your beliefs.Maybe deep down inside they know that their racist beliefs are ignorant,close-minded and they are hypocritical|`|028b4045d26c8c74302a643d0f4ae39daa	Racism is always pushed towards a particular group of people.  White people are called racist more then anyone else.  But racism comes in every culture.  I don't care if your Chinese, Japanese, Mexican, every race has shown hatred in the past.  Not just whites.  Maybe racism wouldn't be an issue if people didn't reiterate certain events in history.  Like slavery, something that went on 140 years ago.  It's over and done with.  Racism is not offensive until people turn it into something that it's not.  I work, why can't other races that roam the streets work?  Welfare must be flourished, and hand outs must be given more and more.  But racism is something that effects everyone.  Those who are racist and those who are being hated.  I don't condone it, but I'm not for or against it either.  Because I do get mad at people of different races from time to time.  But, respect is also something that should be given no matter what.|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	Most people that you think are racists are not.

HU26qopFaa	sounds to me that jeff is not a true friend if he would do something that he knows would hurt you. you should trying talking to him and tell him that your not playing and you really dont want him to go around telling lies about you. if that doesnt work then you should try tricking him into not telling people. sure they will make fun of you (for "raping" them) but they will also make fun of him (for getting "raped"). try using that to get him to back down. i hope this helps<br>  <br>  oh and i think bob really does like you. u should try telling him how you feel or you could leave little hints like how he does. try rubbing his leg for a change or sitting in his lap|`|2UUcuhHZaa	hi,hey listen get jeffan talk to him and say that if he says that about u ,that u will say he sucked the both of you's an love it ,that will make him think about that ,an as for bob just tell him you like him and let him know that you like that he puts his hands on u ,but first talk to him about it an don't say what i told u until you talk to him ok ,no i don't know if he knows you gay but i feel if you like him alot in which i do ,you should just let him know only the two of you alone ,but you also need to know if he feels ok with going out with a guy to,this is hard for u cause in one hand u have a guy u love an a guy u hate ,now u need to make sure the guy u love ,bob ,knows your gay and how he feels about that but don't tell him that ur gay until u know he is cool with it ,so just talk with him ok ,e-mail me i will help u out ok bye 4 now|`|6SwaWSoyaa	Jeff is NOT a friend of yours if he is willing to ruin your reputation just to get a laugh out of it. You tell Jeff immediately to quit that plan, because that can seriously destroy you. Make a joke out of it though if he does go on telling people that. Also I don't think he needs to having fun playing with your sexuality. I am starting to think also that Bob wasn't joking and he was actually enjoying himself, and you might need to pursue that. Don't be too abrasive though. Can you tell me what happens tomorrow?|`|m5O8ogFHaa	Just go with it.

(I hope I'm making sense) Sometimes we need to wonder if these people really are our friends, or if they are just using you. I'm not trying to say he's a bad friend or anything, because I am not one to judge somebody else. =)  I'm just saying to be sure who your friends are. =)<br>  <br>  But in answer to your question, I believe that you should go up to Jeff and say (in a friendly voice), <br>  <br>  "Hey man, I heard that you're going to tell everyone about yesterday... Just to let you know, I was just sitting there the whole time while you did your joke and you KNOW that it would be wrong for you to just go off and tell everybody that I raped you guys. I know you're thinking 'He's just defending himself because he's gay', but I'm saying this because rumors are hard to resolve once started." <br>  <br>  Or you can edit that and change the wording to what suits you best! =) If he's a good friend, he'll understand and play it off as "I wasn't going to really say it to everybody" =) If he's not cool about it, he'll insist that you're defending yourself because you're gay. You don't have to do what I said, but I think it would be one of your best options. You could also play it off as a joke and say something random like: "Bill Cosby tried to posess me!" LOL <br>  <br>  I really hope this helped you! =)

9dacefe0147298c503a128d1950f3628aa	Yes,  even before I came out of the closet I felt comfortable stating that a guy was good looking.  I can tell when a woman is good looking.  As long as you are comfortable with your sexuality, you should be able to tell when you think a guy is good looking or not without having to defend you are gay.

QVKWVValaa	Your question is based on a false premise. Many atheists believe in the Big Bang. That is a something out of nothing belief. And you are also using belief incorrectly. You are talking about faith. I believe I will fall to the ground if I trip. I have justifiable reason to believe in such a thing happening. I don't have to put faith in the fact I will fall.<br>  I am an atheist and I do believe things can just come into existence. The universe just came into existence. What the universe came from prior to the Big Bang is impossible to know. How does a person analyze, or test, nothingness? <br>  Here's a test for you. Let's see if you can answer it. <br>  A finitely complex universe spontaneously came into existence. (Finitely complex because we humans are figuring out how the universe works more and more each day. The universe is something we humans are proving capable of understanding.)<br>  or<br>  An infinitely complex being spontaneously came into existence and then created the universe. (Infinitely complex because God is ALL things: lightness and darkness, existence and nonexistence, time and outside time, rational and irrational (many of theses things being logically incompatible) which reminds me logical and illogical)<br>  So, which makes more sense? Which is the easier answer to believe? For me, if something as infinitely complex as God can just poof into existence, so can something much easier... like say our universe. <br>  And just to make things clear for you: You can NOT have things both ways. If you want to go around having faith that all things need to have a creator, as your question asserts, then the particular creator that you place in the highest esteem must have also had a creator. And that creator had a creator. If you have a right to stop thinking logically and say, "Oh, my creator just always was. He didn't have to be created!" then the universe can have the same kind of explanation: it just always was. <br>  What state the universe was in prior to the state it is in now is irrelevant. That it exists as it is now for us is all we can know. For all we know, so far, the universe could have existed for all eternity prior to the Big Bang making it the way we experience it now. And that to me makes more sense.

q5lreoiWaa	It works if you work it.|`|YuLAYK4Iaa	These programs have a very low success rate, though they are lifesavers for the few that succeed.  Because they have become such ca$h cows for lazy therapists & facilities who expect patients to cure themselves, they have also become sacred cows.<br>  <br>  A major problem is that many addictions are the result of attempts to self-medicate.  The body & mind are suffering, & the drugs/activities of choice merely an individual's attempt to restore equilibrium to his/her life.  No program should accept a patient without a thorough physical & psychological evaluation.  How can you expect the patient to self-discipline a cure for a hormonal or other biochemical imbalance or medical disease?  Is this a proper way to treat issues from years of physical or sexual abuse?  Common sense should prevail, & the treatment should fit the patient.<br>  <br>  I believe 12-step programs have their place, but since the true success rate hovers near 10%, it should definitely be used in a minority of cases.

Esta considerada la <br>  Dama de las catedrales por su ligereza luminosidad y gracia y por mantener una <br>  unidad estilística poco frecuente en estos monumentales edificios.<br>  Con toda la gran riqueza de Segovia son sus iglesias Románicas San Martin, <br>  San Millán, San Esteban, que configuran un estilo propio el Románico Segoviano.<br>  El esgrafiado típico de Segovia, es la técnica modéjar de adornar las fachadas. <br>  En un emplazamiento privilegiado el Altazar se yergue sobre una roca dominando la <br>  ciudad antigua. Bastión Militar y más tarde residencia de Reyes, un paseo por su <br>  interior, nos hace revivir capítulos del pasado.<br>  La Iglesia de la Veracruz fue fundada en el siglo 13 y constituye un ejemplar único <br>  de la arquitectura del románico tardío. Su planta de doce lados casi circular tiene <br>  como modelo el santo sepulto de Jerusalén lo que induce a identificarla con una <br>  construcción Templaria, aun conserva sin embargo el enigma de su origen.<br>  <br>  And now English Translation:<br>  THIS IS A VERY BASIC translation, enough for you to understand what the video is about. But if you would like a precise translation let me know and ill do it tomorrow. <br>  <br>  Segovia: Patrimony City of Humanity<br>  At the foot hills of the mountains of Guadarrama, the 2000 years of the Roman aqueduct have seen Segovia grow.<br>  With stone pillars, 266 arches and 728 meters long, it represents the most accomplished synthesis of art and roman engineering.<br>  This grants Segovia the Honor of being the only city in the world to be a sister city to Rome.<br>  Through the walls and gates of San Andres and the many turning roads, one arrives at Casa de los Picos (house of the points) whose roofs are finished in diamond tips (some sort of style)<br>  It is the most illustrious example of civil architecture of the 15th century. <br>  The Cathedral, the last one built in Spain in Gothic style, is considered the Dame of cathedrals because of its luminosity, grace and maintaining a stylistic unity infrequent in these monumental buildings.<br>  With all of Segovias richness, it is their Romanic churches San Martin, San Millan, and San Esteban that make a unique style, the Segovian Romanic.<br>  The typical ornamental engraving of Segovia, is the technique used to adorn the fronts (fa?ade of the buildings)<br>  In a privileged location the Altazar rises on a rock dominating the old city. First a Military Front and later residency to the Kings, a walk through its interior makes us relive chapters from the past.<br>  The church of Veracruz was founded on the 13th century and constitutes a unique example of late roman architecture.

It’s a little complicated text for beginners. <br>  <br>  Segovia: ciudad Patrimonio de la Humanidad<br>  Segovia: World Heritage City<br>  Al pie de la sierra de Guadarrama los 2000 a?os del acueducto romano han visto crecer a Segovia.. <br>  At the foot of the Sierra de Guadarrama Mountains, the two thousands years of the roman aqueduct have seen how Segovia grows. <br>  <br>  Con sillares de piedra en argamasa los 166 arcos y 728 metros de longitud representan la más lograda síntesis del arte y de la ingeniería romana.<br>  With stone ashlars in mortar, 166 arcs and 728 meters in length, it represent the most successful synthesis of roman art and engineering.<br>  <br>  Esto otorga a Segovia el honor de ser la única ciudad en el mundo hermanada con Roma. <br>  This gives Segovia the honor of being the only city of the world twined with Rome.<br>  <br>  Tras pasar las murallas por la puerta de San Andrés y callejeando se llega a la Casa de los Picos, cuyos sillares están rematados en punta de diamante. <br>  Alter passing the walls through Saint Andrew's door and walking on the streets, you can reach the Casa de los Picos (House of the Points) which ashlars are crowned with diamond points.<br>  <br>  Es el ejemplar segoviano más ilustre de la arquitectura civil del siglo XV. <br>  It’s the more distinguished segovian model from the civil architecture of the XVth century.<br>  <br>  La catedral, última que se construyó en Espa?a en estilo gótico está considerada la “Dama de las Catedrales” por su ligereza, luminosidad y gracia y por mantener una unidad estilística poco frecuente en estos monumentales edificios. <br>  The Cathedral, the last one built in gotic style in Spain, is deemed as the “Lady of the Cathedrals” due its lightness, luminosity and grace and for maintaining a stylistic unity infrequent in these monumental buildings.<br>  <br>  Con todo, la gran riqueza de Segovia son sus iglesias románicas: San Martín, San Millán, San Esteban que configuran un estilo propio: el románico segoviano. <br>  With all, the great wealthy of Segovia is their romanic churches: San Martín, San Millán, San Esteban that set their own style: the romanic segovian.<br>  <br>  El esgrafiado, típico de Segovia, es la técnica mudéjar de adornar las fachadas. <br>  The sgraffitto, typical from Segovia, is the mudejar technique of adorning the facades.<br>  <br>  En un emplazamiento privilegiado, el alcázar se yergue sobre una roca dominando la ciudad antigua. <br>  In a privileged location, the fortress rises over a rock that dominates the old city.<br>  <br>  Bastión militar y más tarde residencia de reyes. <br>  Military bastion and king's house later.<br>  Un paseo por su interior nos hace revivir capítulos del pasado. <br>  A walk into the interior makes us revive chapters of the past.<br>  <br>  La iglesia de Vera Cruz fue fundada en el siglo XIII y constituye un ejemplar único de la arquitectura del románico tardío. <br>  The Vera Cruz Church was founded in the XIIIrd century and it’s an unique model of the late romanic architecture.<br>  <br>  Su planta de doce lados, casi circular, tiene como modelo el Santo Sepulcro de Jerusalén, lo que induce a identificarla con una construcción templaria. <br>  Its twelve-sided floor, almost circular, is inspired by the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem and leads to identify it with a Templar construction. <br>  <br>  Aún conserva, sin embargo, el enigma de su origen<br>  However, it still maintains the enigma of its origin
nQEiNGkeaa	It doesn't have to be painful if you relax, take your time and get your partner to take his time. Use plenty of lube and get him to finger you first, so that you get use to the feeling. When he does start, push out slightly, if you see what I mean. Get him to go slow and stop whenever you tell him too. Any position is good but for your first time I think the best is face to face, simply because you can look into each others eyes. Enjoy and have fun. Don't forget to use a condom.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Is it your first time having full-out sex, or your first time doing anything anal-related?<br>  <br>  If it's the latter, I highly recommend not starting out trying to stick an entire penis in there.  It's not going to be fun.  You want to start off with a finger only, then some light fingering with two or three, maybe in conjunction with some oral sex.  Or small toys like butt-plugs and smaller dildos.  In other words, you want to work your way up.<br>  <br>  If you're already comfortable taking something smaller, the best positions for first-time anal are those that put YOU in control of the speed and depth, and the ones that let you look your lover in the eye, so that you can communicate how you're feeling and he can act accordingly.  As such, my favorite position for first time is him seated, and you facing him and straddling him, essentially lowering yourself down onto him.  It's close, it's intimate, and this way, you get to choose how fast it goes in and how far, until you're comfortable enough with it that the two of you can enjoy doggy style and other positions.<br>  <br>  Another good one would be to get on the edge of the bed, lying on your back, with a pillow propping up your butt.  He then stands and penetrates you.  Again, this way you can see one another's faces, but this time he has more control.<br>  <br>  Anyways, good luck, whatever you choose!  Remember, lots of lube, don't forget to breathe, lower onto it/have him push in when you exhale, try bearing down like you're having a bowel movement (it sounds like it wouldn't work, but it helps it slide in), relax, take your time, be gentle, and get lots of warm-up.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|Vu726Q18aa	69|`|DIqqgNaVaa	well that really depends on preferance and if you are gonna bottom eventually then might as well get it out of the way otherwise top is probably the best choice|`|xFg6y1qEaa	You won't know that until you've tried them all.

vNnvpLKBaa	I personally knew about 12 AKAs, all in their mid 20sto 30s ( my principal was one as well)<br>  <br>  and I have to agree with you. It's depends on the school most of the time.

Its just a old tradition for them to act that way. Back in the days it use to be a majority of light skin pretty girls. So they stuck to calling themselves that. And they use to laugh at the Deltas and call them ugly because they were darker. It goes back to the light skin being better than darks complex that was created by the whites. But at least the sorority had values back then, now they have just lost them.|`|d9e9d3a2969f4661e295d7b587567511aa	personally i believe joining a sorority is not very smart. in college one of the things on your to-do-list is finding yourself, who you want to be. not who other people want you to be.

Because he is not|`|FOZGMadaaa	Sin is sin. Sexual sin penetrates the body and reprobates the mind. <br>  <br>  God makes same sex an abomination when the thoughts and acts or displayed.<br>  <br>  God hates sin.What you see is a difference in mankind and men hate this difference.So they have hidden their sexual tendencies away from others.<br>  <br>  God never ignores sin.God is patient and long suffering. Men are often not so. They punish the things they can not control or feel uncomfortable with. Homosexuality is one of them.<br>  <br>  If God was against this and hated it as men say, as the world says we would have been washed away long ago. The sexual sins of many harbor pride. God is non-gender. He is neither male nor female.God is spirit and he is truth. <br>  <br>  The fields of humanity deny their own unexplored and repressed homosexual tendencies and agree that God made them as they are.<br>  <br>  God made men and women righteous and long-suffering. He made us compassionate toward others. Yet he told us that acts of sin will not be tolerated anytime. What is a popular sin when we all are guilty of something? <br>  <br>  God spends so much of his time to convince the world that he is  and he rewards those that diligently seek him.<br>  <br>  Sin is not his focus it is ours. Salvation and redemption that is his focus. God knows us and he knew us before we came here! God is not saying Oh no that person is a homosexual. psalm 139. <br>  <br>  God gave us his word to heal and comfort us through all things. <br>  <br>  There are spirits such as homosexuality.Orchestrated by Satan to confound many. Mark 5. Legion is many. Spirits that dwell in men that cause men to sin when they are not filled with the spirit of God. Deadly spirits that capture the mind and hearts of many. Spirits that have been there so long that some have been comfortable with.They like it and some suffer from it. They impose some of their lust on the young and and their children for generations suffer the same things or encounter the same from others.<br>  <br>  God is not in sin men are in sin because they do not trust and know God. If God wanted to quash anything I am sure he would have no difficulty and whom could stop him.Right? psalm 107. We should consider the end of life.<br>  <br>  Sexual sin is the worst sin because Satan has added diseases and sickness of the mind to this senario of life for men and women. He came to kill steal and destroy life and hope. He challenges the word of God at all cost. So we have to pay for not calling on God to help us.<br>  <br>  crimes of passion <br>  <br>  jealousy<br>  <br>  HIV<br>  <br>  STD's<br>  <br>  abuse<br>  <br>  depression<br>  <br>  sloth<br>  <br>  envy.<br>  <br>  GLBT movement. Funny! God laughs at us and he laughs at Satan.|`|279ac5587c0a982b23b03bde3f0bbf91aa	Sorry but there is no god to hate gays only people who think it is a sin. Fear breeds fear and they have more than their share. <br>  I find  Fundie Christians to be the most dishonest people I have ever met. They deny that they are ignorant of how the world came to be and dishonest about their own sexuality. They say one thing and do another then say your a sinner and going to hell but we are not perfect but we are forgiven. And they wonder why we find them repulsive. <br>  It is a messed up world when it is ok to condemn people for loving and giving each other pleasure. man an man, woman an woman, or man an woman It makes no difference. <br>  I don't tell them how to or who to pray to  so they should not tell me how  to or who to ****<br>  their oh its a sin statements they can take and stick it in their direct deposit and compound it quarterly. Remember Jesus saves but Moses invests.|`|1VuQNpWbaa	God is doing all this?  I was unaware that when you flipped on the TV, you saw God reaching down from heaven and slapping homosexuals across the face, then reaching for a gun and shooting them.<br>  <br>  God isn't doing this.  People are.<br>  <br>  Hell, not even Christians are doing it.  Society is the one doing it.  Christians believe it is evil, yes, but then again, people in general seem to be prejudiced against gays<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.  If God is gay, then why did he create women?|`|k11IhJGYaa	God himself hasn't spent "so much of his time trying to quash the GLBT movement."  He simply stated in scripture that homosexuality is wrong.  Where in the bible does it say that God hated gays?  It is possible to love someone even though you don't agree or love the things they do or believe.  God loves ALL people.  He simply hates their sins... BIG, BIG difference.|`|QodGdcIiaa	Hi! I am a Catholic Christian 8-D The Lord I believe in is the God of LOVE~he does not hate any, any, any, any, any of His most beloved children. When you say "I hate somebody", it sounds like "I want to kill them." Our Lord could NEVER abhor individuals that are dispositionally homosexual. It goes against His very nature-He is love and He is above all flawlessly holy! However, it would also go against his ever-holy holy holy nature not to condemn sinful behavior. This, however, is key: God hates the SIN, NEVER THE SINNER. NEVEEEEEEEEEEEEEER His precious child. As it says in the Bible, God loves us and we are His; before he formed us in the womb, He knew us. Our Lord understands our personalities. WOULD HE SEEK TO KILL US? NoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNoNo. The THING of homosexuality is repulsive to him, not his loved son or daughter!!!!!!!! He hates the CONDUCT, not the one doing it!! Our Lord is a spirit of love; he is bursting with the refulgence of eternal light: wisdom. What seems so incomprehensible to us He views is perfect clarity; there is no room for suspicion in love, only trust. God is always running towards us with open arms! :) Also, as a flawed flawed FLAWEEED human being I simply cannot sit here and judge children of the Lord of love for being dispositionally homosexual. It would go against MY sinful sinfuuuuul nature to do so. I just want to say that God loathes only what keeps His children far from Him---how could he hate what he fashioned with such care and most importantly LOVE? God bless you  my friend :)?|`|VE33luKcaa	Since "God" means different things to people, the only god that hates the gays or desires to kill them are that of the homophobic and ignorant.

I know some gay people male and female that are very wonderful people, my brother and his partner included.  But according to the word of God they are committing sexual sin. It seems to me like a lot of gay people are on the defensive cause they know the lifestyle isn't right. Again i am not trying to make anyone angry i am just answering the question, no hate mails please.

They may be influenced by something in their mind or by their environment, but to actually have sexual relations with an individual of the same sex is their choice. They don't have to do that. A man wanting another man in a sexual way is JUST AS SINFUL as a man wanting a woman in that way (before marriage). The only way that sex is not sinful is between a man and a woman under the sanctity of marriage. Any other is a disgrace to God's creation. Any individual that feels those desires for one of their own sex does not actually have to have sex. I know it is an unpopular and somewhat unheard-of thought among our society today, but abstinence is possible. You don't have to have sex. It is entirely possible to live your life as a virgin, and if you can't get over your desires, that is what you should do.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	People can no more choose to be homosexual than can they choose to be heterosexual or anything in between. Why would anyone choose to be gay? There are no consolation prizes.

Who would choose that?<br>  <br>  If homosexuality is such a big deal, why was Jesus completely silent on the subject?<br>  <br>  As far as mores and morals, heterosexuals engage in far more sodomy than homosexuals. I do not see religious leaders calling for a ban on oral or anal sex. If those acts are the true foundation of your arguments, why did the fundies push for restrictions against same-sex marriages instead of a Constitutional amendment banning sodomy?<br>  <br>  God hates shrimp.|`|tManvxfQaa	its not  " IF " its a choice, its when they made  " A " choice<br>  <br>  and its because of their OWN LUSTS ..............they made that Choice|`|HIskrREJaa	i don't think it's a choice either.... but i just wanted to point out to you or anyone else that not all gay men like anal sex...that's a stereotype. in fact the same percentage of straight men like it as gay men do. there is a higher percentage of gay men that just do oral... we read about it in my human sexuality class.|`|AA11008046	They no doubt feel inadequate with a woman.

I do not believe that a homosexual person can believe in Christ/God when it is very clear in the Bible that man should not lay with man.  Even so, God is not going to strike someone down for not listening to his commands.  Everyone has a choice to make, so we make them.  Are they right or are they wrong, there is a guide for this.  Sex is for reproducition purposes, that's why God made it so wonderful.  It is not just for pleasure.  Homosexuals cannot reproduce.  Its like making human DNA.  You need a right handed and a left handed protien, but you cannot make one without the other.  Look it up, thats science.  We can try and make Gods plan ugly but the only thing we make ugly is ourselves.  There are many Good people out there, including homosexuals.  But I think there are going to be a lot of good people in Hell.  I know you will disagree but think about the fact that what if homsexuals are wrong?  Who loses, and who wins? For fun lets just look at it this way.  If your a gambler, believers in Christ  have a 50/50 shot at being right. Homosexuals do not.  They cash all their chips on the hand they have.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	because people are deceived<br>  <br>  they think it is natural and normal when God says it is not.<br>  <br>  So then why do people have sex with children?<br>  Is it because they are born that way?<br>  Why do people have sex with animals or dead bodies?<br>  Are they born that way?<br>  <br>  Why do these people choose to do these things?<br>  Do they enjoy it?<br>  yes they do or they would not do it.<br>  <br>  To have sex they have to be sexually excited<br>  So if they are having that type sex they appear to enjoy it and get excited by it or they would not be able to do it.<br>  <br>  I have never heard one person exclaim oh woe is me I am stuck having this type of sex and I can not stop my self and can not stop from doing it.<br>  <br>  So yes they choose to do it because it excites them.
jzdDF3Ljaa	your kids will have deformities.|`|XnNT4l0Xaa	I know that most people think it is wrong period. But also it is wrong because if you were to have children with this said cousin, there could be birth defects.<br>  <br>  But one thing I don't understand is that a long time ago (like when the Egyptians lived) the Pharaohs married their sisters. They had tons of children with them too. Why was the law all of a sudden enforced?|`|hy3q2iWaaa	in many cultures, extended family (cousins, aunts, uncles, etc.) are integral part of the family. Cousins are considered as brothers and sisters and it's a breach in morality for them. Secondly, if two couple are closely related, there is a high risk of genetic defects to the children.|`|v4isCHzvaa	Some children when born to parents who are cousins have birth defects. For this reason many people are against it. I don't have a problem with it however if they cannot have kids, like if they are gay (of the same sex) or get surgery so that they cannot reproduce.|`|ocy7FEcaaa	It all has to do with genetics. When two closely related people procurate, they take the risk of making any genetic mistakes worse. Also it's just gross.|`|eGtZXgRHaa	You can have problems if you have kids together, 'cause of the genetic.|`|aqPWNeSeaa	When two people make a baby together, genetic selection occurs.  That is, nature is intended to have a way of selecting the best/strongest/healthiest genes.  However, when two people who are blood related make a child together, the gene pool is "smaller" so to speak.  There is less variety for nature to choose from.  This results in a higher occurence of birth defects.

I was a manager at a fitness facility and dance instructor and this is what my ladies decided would happen if we met out 7,500 donation goal.  My hair was about 50 inches long and all was donated to charity for wigs for kids. <br>  <br>  Go for it.  Who cares what people think.  It's selfless and it helps to raise awareness.  Besides it grows back, and short hair is very posh.  At least that's what I told myself.|`|4bcf909c7d0447d7aee06fdbd04988f2aa	Women today are free to wear any hairstyle that she will be confident with.  Society is accepting bald heads on women.  If your hair is slow in growing back, maybe just a close short style will be better, than completely bald,  woman going to chemo treatments loose a lot of hair over time.  Wigs come in handy for bad hair days or for those have treatments.|`|fSwZhDa7aa	Shaved heads do not look good on chicks.|`|FZSC2RWWaa	no it just wrong|`|OzK10hKxaa	Well congratulations in what you are doing. I couldn't even shave my head, and that's coming from a guy.<br>  <br>  Well, I agree you would have to be confident to do it and the opposite of shameful and degraded. I think in terms of fetish though, it isn't one of the most popular. Most fetishes are unseen, but you couldn't hide that so much, and if you look around you, I don't think you'll see many women with shaven heads.<br>  <br>  Personally speaking, I do not find it attractive nor have I met anyone who would say that it is. And unfortunately, most people do associate it with cancer patients. It is also along the lines of tomboyish.<br>  <br>  I think people will be supportive of what you are doing, and not that it will particularly suit you. <br>  If you've never done it before, I do think you will be very shocked. <br>  <br>  I do praise your bravery, but I do feel, much like everyone else, and maybe indeed yourself, that you will not feel your most attractive that way. I know it isn't all about vanity, but you did state you take a lot of pride and joy in your hair, and why not? And when that has all gone, it is going to be tough.|`|pVrNJmgpaa	Who cares what others think about it, you are doing a very nice thing for your friend, and that's what matters.
VrR9ojRRaa	To be honest, I think we are naturally bad. As negative as it sounds.<br>  <br>  That's how we define reality, through bad things. Like if something good happens people say "Its too good to be true" and "only in your dreams".<br>  <br>  We are so negative and people seem to find more enjoyment in doing the wrong thing rather than the right thing.|`|Q9BNAK7waa	naturally bad I mean have you ever read a history book the first page says it all|`|KPNOQAP4aa	human beings are sinful in nature, until we have been made clean by Jesus. <br>  <br>  even after that, we are still inclined to evil, but with God's help we can follow the image of Christ. Since we are created in the image of God, we can aspire to be perfectly good once we have accepted Jesus, because one day we will be in heaven!<br>  <br>  so i guess humans don't always intend towards evil, but we still commit evil actions because we do have a heriditary trait of sinfulness that we brought on ourselves by disobeying God.|`|ubAPZjp5aa	i think that people both can be naturally bad and good
iCMrsV9daa	Look religion is what it is and you just have to accept that. A woman was made for a different purpose than a man, we are different and sometimes we just have to embrace those differences rather than trying to fight them. I dont have any problem with a man being physically stronger than me (do u like to be stronger than ur man?) I dont have a problem with my role as the child barer and carer because i know that a man couldnt do my job as good as me if his life depended on it! The fact the women shouldnt be rulers was probably because women are known to be more sensitive than men and would probably rule on the basis of emotion. The 2 women= one man thing, well i dunno about that one, yeah it kinda sucks but ah well its not really bothering me that much (we all know women are smarter than men, its kinda a fact!) so who cares. <br>  <br>  The mahram is just so the woman does not get harrassed or possibly raped or in some sort of danger, its just a protection. This is usually when she goes out at night only, to a party, to the city or whatever. Unless your talking about extreamists muslims in which case extreamists are found in every religion and they dont represent the majority.<br>  <br>  edit to the person on top: Your claims are false and ridiculous! You are probably talking about a small minority, thats like saying non-muslims are always drunk and beat their wives and do drugs and most of them are transexuals and commit adultry. Its ok for them to have 50 partners in their lifetime and they kick their kids out when they turn 18.They wife swap, incest, have freaky fetishes and go to nude beaches! You do have this in your society do you not? Does it make you all like that? No because there is gonna be a bunch of wackos wherever you go, its not restricted to a certain religion or culture.|`|TMb076n6aa	IT DOESN'T !!! <br>  <br>  It forces them into bondage overseas men beat thier wives and women are oppressed and ruled over.<br>  <br>   I cannot understand why some American women  want to become muslem when they dont understand that once they get off American soil they are treated very bad. <br>  <br>  See this movie below. BASED ON A TRUE STORY<br>  <br>  Shariah Law if some women so much as show her wrist in some countries she is beaten publically and raped. <br>  <br>  WOMEN are also circumsized so they dont feel pleasure while having sex .<br>  <br>  I know one from overseas that escaped from those performing the procedure.|`|fznvorZjaa	I believe the logic goes that women are liberated from being public sex objects...It's hard to objectify some one in a burka or even a hijab.  <br>  <br>  My problem is in many Muslim societies (countries were Islam is the law), women aren't given a choice in this matter.|`|ki8kdpJPaa	How does religion liberate anyone?|`|UBcBjRMfaa	If you are speaking as opposed to Christianity, read the old testament.

It's an absurd ritual for an equally absurd perspective.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	A "non-Christian church"?<br>  <br>  Huh?|`|uFAoq4idaa	Baptism is not essential to our salvation. It is our relationship with God that counts. Even how many times you had been baptized if you have not established a closer relationship with God you are lost. Abide in Him and He will abide in you.|`|sebhK7r7aa	Baptism isn't neccesary for salvation, so it makes no difference.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Non-Christian church?|`|xwDzek6uaa	Since when do non Christian churches baptize?<br>  <br>  If its not by immersion its not a baptism. Baptism means to immerse/submerge. You cant do that unless you actually go under. Besides the symbolism in Romans doesnt make any sense with sprinkling.<br>  <br>  Next question you need to ask is whether the person who preformed the baptism was authorized to do so. Not just anyone can baptize. Only those who are called of God as Aaron was. That means they need to be ordained/set apart with the knowledge of the congregation through prophecy and revelation.<br>  <br>  Pray to God to learn all truth and accept it when you hear it. And He will lead you to true baptism.|`|e21a15c26fe150cd05b8f03735e6ce4caa	Being sprinkled makes it non-Christian? It's amazing how credo baptism can look so good on paper that it can have people believing that immersion is the only biblical way to get baptized.  Looks like the hook is set with your family, and your church has long since reeled them in. <br>  <br>  You CAN walk away from that church.  Let them anathematize you.  Shake the dust from your feet. You stay with your sprinkling. You were baptized, and it was valid if done in Jesus' name or in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  1 Peter 3:20-21 for instance mentions a flood of people drowning in their immersion while Noah and his family were saved by sprinkles of rain.  Sprinkling exists throughout redemptive history, and there is a continuity today in being baptized by this method.|`|7cbef831f7563f52decc4a5d7b871738aa	Honestly, I think you shouldn't consider yourself a Christan until you've been baptized. Yes, it will make a difference, if you're really committed to this religion then you should get baptized in the way it practices as it is.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	As long as it was done in the prescribed way under the proper authority, then you have nothing to worry about.  I have baptized people in lakes, rivers, and swimming pools, too.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	How do you know it was non-christian. The bible does not say full immersion is necessary. It just says water.|`|HTXsEms9aa	find you a good Holiness church<br>  when our preacher baptized we go to a lake<br>  he  baptizes the old fashion way|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Check out a Christian Church and get immersed!|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	yes|`|AA12129313	Being immersed is absolutely necessary for salvation. Besides, even if it wasn't, why take a chance? If you get to the Judgement and find out "Oh, darn, all I had to do was ask for my minister to baptize me in the water and I'd be able to go to Heaven and live in eternal bliss with my Father" but you hadn't, you would have to leave your Lord and Savior to be tortured without end. Please don't listen to people who say it isn't necessary. It absolutely is.<br>  <br>  Also, about the man who died on the cross beside Jesus, he didn't need to be baptized because the prophecy hadn't been fulfilled quite yet. Jesus was still alive, so salvation did not require baptism yet. Only after Jesus died did that become necessary.|`|TbZeLX6laa	Water baptism cannot save, water baptism is not required for salvation, and water baptism cannot be added to Jesus's perfect salvation. <br>  <br>  Water baptism is only for the ALREADY saved.  So, are you saved?  <br>  <br>  Here's how to be saved:  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|nx7QtF0paa	First of all, you don't need to be baptized to go to Heaven... the thief on the cross wasn't... You need to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and repent of your sins.  <br>  Remember- we are saved by faith not works lest any man should boast. Eph 2:9<br>  I hope that helps.<br>  <br>  I just want to add, their is a difference between religion and faith.  Jesus did not come to this life to start a religion, he came to give us faith and to die for our sins.  So that all who believe in Him have everlasting life.|`|tOh85To7aa	As long as you know Jesus as your Saviour it doesn't matter,remember the man on the cross beside Jesus.Was he baptized,the most important thing is to know Jesus.

It's complex, but the basic premise is "Things which are better at living in a certain environment will breed themselves into the population more and thus the species as a whole will become more like them"<br>  <br>  For example; If there are a bunch of bright pink rats living in a green field, they will be easy prey for birds. If a mutation occurs ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation</a> - Mutations are nothing magical. It's just chemicals going a little wrong ) which makes one rat the same green as the field, it will be WAY more likely to survive, and pass on its genes (by sexing it up with lady rats) and over time, with the green rats surviving and thus breeding way more, ALL of those rats' offspring will eventually be green<br>  <br>  Obviously evolution takes a damn long time, since you would only expect one gene to be passed on at a time (like the green pigment gene)<br>  <br>  The original life form(s) are thought to have been basic chemicals (fats, RNA, water, etc) which came together pretty much by chance. Scientists are trying to recreate a basic life form now (sorry I can't find a link. Read it in Newscientist ages ago)<br>  <br>  Water's just a chemical. Two hydrogens and an oxygen. All just electricity. Plants evolved in the same manner as animals, though they reproduce differently (pollen and flowers are plant gametes) <br>  <br>  Which god? Not that it matters, I don't believe in any of them. They are a myth, and if you do believe in god I would ask you to consider: Is it strange that almost everyone believes in the same god as their parents? I think it is. I think that parents pass their religion on, and the children don't often enough consider its validity.<br>  <br>  No I don't believe in ghosts. They don't make sense (what are they made of? why can no reputable scientist find one? everything is a blur about ghosts and that SCREAMS hoax)<br>  <br>  When we die.. our organs stop functioning, so our brain loses power, stops getting oxygen, etc. Without it our brain dies, and after four minutes serious brain damage will set in, making revival pointless even if it were possible. Eventually the body will decompose<br>  <br>  We are just our bodies. Mostly our brains, but all our body really. When you're hungry, it's as much your stomach as your brain which demands food. We do not have "souls". Same as ghosts; No one can prove one. No reputable scientist has ever found one.

Just add energy source, carbon, water, and billions of years! <br>  <br>  If you want to look at things VERY broadly: we came from Neanderthals which came from apes which came from monkeys which came from arboreal lemur-like creatures, which came from small mouse-like mammals that lived in the ground during the mass extinction of dinosaurs. Those mouse creatures came from a shrew-like creature which came from lizards, back to to amphibian, fish, invertebrate, worm, sponge, single-celled life, chemical interactions.<br>  <br>  You happy?|`|0IG3lEpaaa	I don't believe we came from apes. I believe in the creationist theory that we came from God as the Bible states. However the creation account is not exhaustive and may be interpreted various ways.<br>  <br>  I do believe that a micro evolution does exists in each species and that explain the various races around the world. However, if you study how these paleontologists put together their evolutionary theories it's simply foolishness. They find one bone and create a billion year theory around it. It astonishes me, really.<br>  <br>  I stay away from the subject of ghosts because is creeps me out.However, I do believe that there is a spiritual war going on around us.|`|sys48nMIaa	it is my belief that everything is energy. <br>  <br>  Everything that exists in the universe is made up of energy.  Every atom has electrons, sub-atomic particles containing an electrical charge, which orbit around the atom's nucleus.  Every atom has energy.  True, some atoms have more energy than others; some have more electrons orbiting their nucleus than others, and some are moving faster than others.  The energy in a piece of wood is moving very slow compared to the energy in a pan of boiling water, but both contain the same kind of energy.<br>  When people die nothing comes up on an EEG why? because the electricity that is conducted by the brain is no longer there. however, energy cannot be created or destroyed. So in death we are only transferring energy.<br>  <br>  Now Ghosts, are in fact energy. If you've ever watched a ghost hunting show, they find ghosts by measuring energy levels.<br>  <br>  I know this was a lot. But even if you disagree I hope you find what you're  looking for <br>  <br>  Evolution is a theory that we all came from single celled organisms. <br>  I don't really know too much about it, so I can't help you there|`|94KDq48Aaa	I wonder this too.|`|Befp3grDaa	single cell organisms that evolved over a huge amount of time<br>  <br>  when the earth was first created it was very hot, took a long time to cool down but wile it was asteroids always hit which brought water to earth with the organisms, lots more time and we get plants underwater until the earth finally becomes able to support life outside of water.<br>  <br>  No, believing in something that doesn't exist is silly<br>  <br>  No, there is no such thing<br>  <br>  You die, you don't even realize you are dead because you are DEAD!|`|xuvqrnOoaa	munkey... we came form munkeys.......|`|zgs3LGpjaa	Oh, look it up for yourself you lazy bum.

God created us and the Earth. When we die, if we know Jesus, then we will go to heaven. if you don't know Jesus (and if the rapture doesn't come) Then you go to hell. If the rapture comes before death, and you are a christian, you go to heaven. if the rapture comes, and you are not a christian, you will be given one more chance. Then, if you don't come to the Lord you will be destroyed along with Satin and Heaven will come down to "The new earth". This is a confusing concept, but I wish you luck.

Most scientists believe that we evolved over millions (if not billions) of years from single celled cells. Other people believe that the earth is 6,000 years old and was created by a divine being. This is based solely on the Bible and does not have any scientific evidence conclusive with this. <br>  <br>  One would imagine if ghosts were real god would be real or that if someone believed in ghosts then they would believe in god.<br>  <br>  No one was there when humanity was created and no one really knows what happens when we die.

It's so confusing to me. AHHHHHH|`|n5DlXdsCaa	We didn't. If you pick up an anatomy book, a history book, or search the internet, you can see the complexity of human life. Humans have thoughts and feelings, and interdependant parts physically that couldn't have possibly evolved from nothing. This is the plain truth. In the beginning, God created the Heavens and the Earth. That's in Genesis 1:1, and after that the Bible has all the other answers you need. If you need Scientific evidence for an intelligent designer, it's there, too.

AA11025703	Well, I am a Christian, one of Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>  <br>  We certainly aren't the largest group in the world.<br>  <br>  Allot of my "weird" beliefs I've seen refered to on Y!A, certainly are weird, some seem just silly, others seem down right dangerous, but thankfully, they aren't ACTUALLY my beliefs.<br>  <br>  At times it is simply a misunderstanding of an Actual belief.  More often than not, in my opinion, on Y!A, when someone tries to explain how weird I am, they use totally made up explainations, like "Witnesses can't use computers", which of course, while I'm online, on my laptop, makes me laugh.<br>  <br>  Then there are the occaisions where someone is correct about our beliefs, and finds them weird, their choice.<br>  <br>  Example, our not celebrating Christmas.  It is because we choose to not celebrate a Pagan holiday, our choice.|`|AA11883252	The teachings and beliefs may be weird but the JW's are actually good people.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	They teach and follow a false gospel and a false christ and believe 'they' can eventually become 'gods' themselves!

Everything we believe is based on the Bible. One of our beliefs for example is that there is no such thing as hell. If you want to know more about what we believe, I suggest you find the nearest Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses near you and visit. There are also Jehovah's Witnesses preaching everywhere, so you can go up to them and ask questions. You can also visit www. watchtower.org which is our official website.|`|cic4J2hzaa	i work with someone that is Jehovah witness. I disagree with some of the things they believe. For example.....When they say only 144,000 will make it into the kingdom and how that say celebrating Christmas and birthdays arent right, and they dont think heaven exist. They believe that it will be paradise here on earth. I dont have anything against them i just get upset when i hear taht they go door to door telling people something that is incorrect. When God clearly states that we are not to add nor to take away to his word. But yea...thats how i feel bout the whole situmawation :) Take care<br>  <br>  OH AND YES....ABOUT THE WHOLE BLOOD TRANSFUSION THINGY. I BELIEVE IF SOMEONE IS SICK THEN THEY SHOULD TAKE THERE MEDICINE THEREFORE IF THEY NEED A BLOOD TRANFUSSION THEY SHOULD GET IT. NOT SAYING THAT GOD ISNT BIG ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE THAT NEEDS IT BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS FOR...YA KNOW? MY DAUGHTER HAD TO HAVE 2 BLOOD TRANSFUSSIONS...I COULDNT IMAGINE HAVING TO TELL THEM THEY COULDNT DO IT...YA KNOW?|`|rLDlNm9Saa	Well they believe that only 144,000 good JW will go to heaven.

hbvIZPrQaa	LOL!!!!  This question is hilarious...only because I know it's asked out of ignorance. (And i dont mean that disrespectfully) but I think you just honestly want to know.  Well I'm black and I must admit that i LOVE chicken.  Almost all black ppl I know ask the same question as you.  I was once told that we love chicken so much because when blacks were slaves they would be given scraps to eat and sometimes this included chicken...so they just seasoned it up and chowed down.  Its been that way ever since!  lol Now the fingernail thing I would think comes down to someone's (not just black) perception of beauty.  Hope that answers your question.|`|Ch39oU58aa	All races love chicken. As far as the fingernails, most black people don't have extremely long nails.  Not sure how long you have been in America, but you should get out more.  No one that I know has long fingernails.|`|a1hevOG2aa	Psh, that doesn't mean anything, everyone loves chicked, lol.

Just because the few ppl you've met may have those characteristics, it does not apply to millions of Americans who are black, that you have not personally met and discussed their feelings about chicken or finger nails...If you think this was really socially acceptable to say, would you say this to a black man or woman? I know lots of whites who like bbq and collard greens, but I don't assume they all do (I live in the southern part of the US, ppl eat disgusting things here, just like all sorts of places do).|`|4Te5gVvDaa	Don't care to much for chicken and I tend to stay away from fried foods.

So Carl only thinks that homosexuality is about sexual feeling, and looking a certain way, which is so not how I think about homosexuality.

wnSvjwWuaa	Most of what is seen, heard, disseminated as "facts" about the gay community have been edited and packaged by companies which are owned/managed by straight, homophobic people - unfortunately, most of the news organizations and major networks do have incredible sway over public opinion. Add to this the constant assaults of the religious right and it's no wonder that when people are asked about what they think of gay people, they reply in a variation of one of these:<br>  <br>  "anti-religion"<br>  "satanic"<br>  "sinner"<br>  "child molester"<br>  "destroyer of the family unit"<br>  "oversexed and promiscuity personified"<br>  "unable to form monogamous and loving relationships"<br>  "users"<br>  "money grabbers and gold diggers"<br>  "prostitutes"<br>  "scours playgrounds for children to entice into the gay lifestyle"<br>  <br>  We know these aren't true, but this is what is fed into the general public's consciousness.<br>  <br>  I actually believe that we have even a higher standard of morals, values and ethics, because by being who we are, we know the truth of what a person is, it's what inside that counts, not the outside. If your actions emanate from a place of love, kindness, decency and humility, you can do no wrong. We don't concern ourselves with who someone is sleeping with or who they have a relationship with, that is something for the parties in that relationship only. If you treat your fellow humans with compassion and dignity, then you can ask for no more.|`|AA11164025	No, i agree with you on that, the media has like unsmart people ugh, the don;t tell the REAL news at all...|`|XxVTw5U3aa	yah i hate those.....<br>  now whenever i tell people im bi they just say im an attention whore<br>  thanks to a shot at love and stuff<br>  and all the gays in shows are always like stereotypical|`|a1hevOG2aa	I agree with you, but only to a point.  You mention how demeaning a double shot is, and it is, it makes me sick, but there are also straight versions, like flavor of love, rock of love, ect.  Also, most LGBT's do have the standards you're talking about, its the ones who don't that make the most noise and draw the most attention, and that's why people think of us the way they do.  I see your point, but don't be so judgemental, not everyone is like that and you pretty much insulted the whole LGBT community with that statement.<br>  <br>  <br>  i agree with that 100%, its about love, not sex, and  you're definately right about that fact that people who billboard sex as the main goal for LGBT's are just givin us a bad rep|`|aqPWNeSeaa	You are certainly not the only one.  <br>  <br>  Granted, there are shows that depict straight people as sex-crazed morons sometimes too, but it's different.  The reason it is different is that most people know a straight couple and have been able to see their real-life interactions.  <br>  <br>  Not everyone knows (or knows that they know ;-) ) a gay person.  The image they see is the media's oversexed image.  It makes it harder for us to get support from the straight community because it's even harder for them to understand when all they see is hedonistic behavior on TV.  If there were more real-life examples of gay relationships in the media, we would have a much more balanced forum for discussions.  It's hard to overcome those stereotypes.<br>  <br>  One day!|`|h7Uz7oN5aa	The reality shows you're talking about, that's a whole nother story in and of itself.  I think you'd be hardpressed to find a dis play of real love of any of those, gay or str8.  But when you are talking about heterosexuals and their views of the gay community, you're right.  Especially if they dont have personal contact with anyone from the gay community, all they know about us is heresay, rumors, and what they are presented with in the media.  And, face it, the media loves to show the most flamboyant, outspoken, horrible stereotypes because thats the type of thing that gets ratings.  Its boring to see a normal homosexual couple doing what most of us do, going to work, coming home and eating dinner before watching some prime time tv and then go to bed.  Pretty typical, just like mom and pops did when we were growing up.|`|18gIVR8aaa	Well, I mean, a lot of people have been born in homes where homosexuality is considered downright wrong. Even to those who didn't grow up in homes like that, it's still something very different to see. Not the norm, you know? I do agree about the shows being wrong, they do make some people even more stereotypical. But what can we really do? My mom has always told me she will accept me for who I am and she has taught me to never judge people, in any way. I will teach my kids that, and hopefully, they'll teach their kids that. I can only hope that eventually, people will realize that we are all humans, and we should be able to love whoever we want to love.|`|v4isCHzvaa	I definitely agree. I hate how at pride events there always are people with their shirts off or half-naked and just acting ******* crazy. Like seriously?! Yeah I'm gay but I'm not an out of control whore.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Personally, speaking, I have plenty of standards and values (I'm bi) and so do the lesbians and bisexuals I know. I'm a feminist and most stereotypes about feminists are also negative and hostile and illogical (how can we be butch dykes who hate men AND s!ults that do everything that moves?). The feminist (or "women libber") stereotypes are decades old, media stereotypes left over from the 1960's and 1970's. I see glbt facing the same media stigma - both groups are trapped in the past by an aging media that has no clue what has gone on with feminists or the glbt community for decades. Thankfully, more people get news from the internet, which has a lot more options than the tired old tv news or radio or papers, so there's hope that ppl will get a little diversity in their media world and actually learn something new about feminists, people of color and lgbt's.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	No, you're not the only one, we are few and proud

C4YVzOfzaa	It is rated R because of the heavy subject matter.  After all, it is about the destruction of their marriage and their selves in 1950s suburbia, how Frank works at a job he hates in New York City, then commutes home to two children.  Frank and April's marriage is not as perfect as it seems to the outside world, and the audience gets to witness their downfall.  This is not light hearted fare for children.

9dacefe0147298c503a128d1950f3628aa	the fact that you are letting them stay in your apartment doesn't mean you get limited to how much of the apartment you get to use.  If they really had a problem with it, I am sure that they would find different living arrangements.  I am sure they are glad for you hospitality.  Unless your finding something that is going against what they are telling you, I would just go with the flow.  <br>  <br>  As for you feeling like you are intruding, it is your place, and you have all the right to use all of your apartment.  If they are changing clothes or something, I would request them to change in the bathroom or when you are out of the apartment so that no other thoughts or accusations could be made later down the road.  <br>  <br>  I am glad to hear that there are some people that can still befriend thier exes.  Not all exes are bad people, just wasn't meant to be together.|`|hhJrwRNdaa	Move !!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|1OlrB0Z1aa	give them the bedroom and u take the futon?<br>  that way there's no chance of disturbing them

As it is now, a lot of gays have never had that option and therefore the "waiting for marriage part" was not a realistic goal.  Though there are, believe it or not, plenty of gays who do wait til they meet someone they plan on sticking with long term.|`|m5O8ogFHaa	I am not waiting until marriage but im waiting. I am not going to be another gay slut who ***** everyone... I dont want to feel like some worthless peice of crap after every time i have sex.

Im not bothered as Im not a marriage person but im just wondering.|`|bR1jDMDRaa	Do whatever makes you feel comfortable.|`|ehfzZwDbaa	I was waiting for the right guy too, but as soon as I came out to all my friends, the right guy turned out to be the soccer player with the very nice but and cute smile I met this summer.....he was the right man....for two weeks...|`|hbvIZPrQaa	Marriage seems to be hard to obtain in this country for gays but I think that more gay ppl should actually have sex out of love and not just lust...As should ALL ppl.
oY4vwdjVaa	They don't go that far just to find out if you're gay. My husband was in the Navy and he managed to keep his willy in his pants the whole time he was in there. Most of the people in the military are from the bible belt so I suggest you keep your sexuality to yourself. Being in the military means that you have to give up cretin things and this is one of them.<br>  <br>  Hopefully Obama will straighten this crap out by the time you get in.|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	Dont join the army- whether you're gay or not<br>  <br>  Dont put your life on the line to protect corporate profits!!!!!!!!!!!|`|9dacefe0147298c503a128d1950f3628aa	The military does not ask you or check to see if you are gay when you enlist for service.  Though you lose the ability to be open about your sexuality, the "don't ask, don't tell" policy does not stop you from acting upon your urges in private.  Just can not get caught doing anything gay.  <br>  <br>  The military is very very easy to get into, with most more than willing to do almost anything to get you to sign papers.  Getting out honorably is the difficult part unless you finish your term of enlistment.<br>  <br>  I was in the Marine Corps and I know there are quite a few gay men (and women) that are enlisted and currently serving in the military.  The choice is yours if you are really wanting to join and live that lifestyle.  <br>  <br>  If they were to do a background check on me in that detail before I went in, I would have never made it with all the porn and the fact that i lost my virginity long before i graduated high school.<br>  <br>  If your just wanting someone to yell at you and see hot men in uniforms, you can get that elsewhere...j/k|`|WHcBV7rLaa	I agree with Dave87...<br>  In the words of a wonderful song by Anti-Flag, "Bright futures exchanged for profit, living half a life"<br>  <br>  Plus, why serve a government that won't give you your own rights?|`|8OXVSoe0aa	Look they don't really do a background check. They need people in the military and sometimes they know you're gay but they won't say anything as long as you don't say anything.|`|1J4OfumGaa	just dont ask tell them if they ask you <br>  join marines|`|v4isCHzvaa	Don't do it.|`|92a39160b5f170df4b5ef1729f3b2395aa	To be on the safe side I would make your profiles private, but that is more for once you are in and people start suspecting something. The only reason they would do a completely thorough background check is if you are going into a rate that requires a top secret clearance. In that case, you will have to fill out this extended questionnaire about references that have known you for the past 15 years or so. I am pretty sure they wouldn't be asked directly if you are gay, they may freely talk about it because as civilians it might not seem like a big deal to them if they mention it. You will have to get used to the closet again, and figure out what is safe to talk about and with whom. As a female, my male counterparts knew about me, but I never shared it with other females.

If you had nothing but platonic feelings for that person, would you be hurt or would you be okay to talk  about it?<br>  I think that maybe you just think you are falling for him because he is for one , not available, and two, him and you have become such good friends based on great talks and spending time without being sexually involved. Maybe you are just lonely and think that since he knows you well and seems to accept and love you for who you are, unconditionally, that it would be safe to fall in love with him? Or maybe you just really do like him more than you thought you would, but you have to tell yourself that it's like asking him to do the impossible, and why even do that? Do you think he could be bi- sexual, then go for it, discuss your feelings. If you know for sure that he is gay, then you are better of not risking what you have - a great friendship- and just keep a little distance between the two of you for a period of time. In that time go out with other people and see what other fish are at the sea, for there are many!!!  Good Luck!!|`|aqPWNeSeaa	Bummer.  <br>  <br>  If you already like him, it may be too late.<br>  <br>  You just need to assess the situation from a rational standpoint, knowing that you can find someone with the qualities you find attractive in him (good listener, sensitive, funny, etc) that will be able to return your romantic feelings.  <br>  <br>  If you're good enough friends, maybe you should tell him.  Perhaps just getting it out in the open would make you feel better.  And maybe he knows someone else who is into you.  ;-)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fLdGGMENaa	Same thing happened to me.<br>  I was in love with my best friend then he turned gay before I told him.<br>  Eventually, you'll be grossed out because you'll probably find yourself rating guys together then it just gets plain weird.|`|HLOYlhdKaa	read pretty things... trust me the same thing happens to a girl<br>  <a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0525475222.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.amazon.com/images/P/052547...</a>|`|OdFIQYyhaa	go to someone you trust and talk to he or she about it.  that always works.
b77e3653645e3dac63531dc95d5b9d48aa	Hiragana is the alphabet for ordinary Japanese words and suffixes.<br>  Katakana is used to spell out foreign words.<br>  If you were a beginning Japanese student, you would write out commonplace words and Japanese names in Hiragana ("Hello,"  "I'm going to the library."  "Hiroko is going to the library.")  You would write non Japanese names and places and imported words in Katakana.  ("Alex", "Ohio", "banana")<br>  <br>  The letters appear slightly distinctive of each other.  Hiragana is usually rounder and curlier, and Katakana is usually box like, consists of straight lines.

The Bible also talks about honouring your Mother and Father, which is also good. <br>  <br>  First, ask yourself "can i live without my hone and talking with my friends for just one period of 24 hours?" If you find you can't do this, I think you might be addicted to talking on the phone, in which case it might be healthy to have a day of rest from that. <br>  <br>  But, if you actually really NEEDED to talk to a friend on Sunday, for a legitimate reason that couldn't wait until tomorrow, then I think it would be alright to phone your friends. Jesus himself said "Is it better to do good, or to do evil on the Sabbath?" So, if you can help your friend by talking to them on Sunday, and if they need your help that day and can't wait to the next, then you should call. But don't take advantage of this principle, and try and convince your Mom that there's a legitimate reason to talk on the phone every Sunday. Day of rest is important still, and so is honouring your parents command. <br>  <br>  There is obviously no verse which says you can talk to your friends on Sabbath - but talking to people was an acceptable activity, in fact, a necessary one for Sabbath, for the Sabbath is a time of rest for the whole community - friends and family. But, particularly family. Think on these things, and if you are to reason with your mother, reason from the scriptures, the only Word of God, the Bible. I've listed some scripture below for you. <br>  <br>  God bless you.|`|UBcBjRMfaa	I'm not entirely sure what you mean. Do you need to prove that God is okay with you hanging out with friends? There are scriptures for that, however the Sabbath IS important if it's what you believe in you should take all parts of your religion. Friendships are a great way to grow into God (if you are Christian) because they show us how we imperfect humans can love, imagine how much our perfect God can love! it's astounding really!<br>  Some scriptures from Proverbs that MAY help you:<br>  <br>  Proverbs 27:9<br>  Oil and perfume rejoice the heart; so does the sweetness of a friend's counsel that comes from the heart.<br>  <br>  Proverbs 27:17<br>  As iron sharpens iron, so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	fellowship=friends= friends in the body of Christ<br>  The American Heritage Dictionary defines fellowship as, "The condition of being together or of sharing similar interests or experiences." With a broad definition like this, some might say that fellowship is nothing more than hanging out or belonging to the same club. However, fellowship, in its truest form, is so much more than several people getting together in the same place for the same reason. <br>  1 John 1:3<br>  That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.|`|rU6nh42Eaa	I'm afraid you're phoneless.

8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	Salt, always used for the seasoning of food and for the preservation of things from corruption, had from very early days a sacred and religious character.<br>  <br>  The Prophet Eliseus employed it to make palatable the waters of a well (2 Kings 2:19 sqq.). The Orientals used it to cleanse and harden the skin of a newborn child (Ezekiel 16:4); by strewing salt on a piece of land they dedicated it to the gods; in the Jewish Law it was prescribed for the sacrifices and the loaves of proposition (Leviticus 2:13). In Matthew 5:13, salt symbolizes wisdom, though perhaps originally it had an exorcistic signification.<br>  <br>  Its use in the Church belongs exclusively to the Roman Rite. The Ritual knows two kinds of salt for liturgical purposes, the baptismal salt and the blessed salt.<br>  <br>  The former, cleansed and sanctified by special exorcisms and prayers, is given to the catechumen before entering church for baptism. According to the fifth canon of the Third Council of Carthage it would seem that salt was administered to the catechumens several times a year. This use of salt is attested by St. Augustine (Confessions I.11) and by John the Deacon. St. Isidore of Seville speaks of it (De off., II, xxi), but in the Spanish Church it was not universal.<br>  <br>  The other salt is exorcized and blessed in the preparation of holy water for the Asperges before high Mass on Sunday and for the use of the faithful in their homes. The present formula of blessing is taken from the Gregorian Sacramentary (P.L., LXXVIII, 231). Both baptismal salt and blessed salt may be used again without a new benediction.<br>  <br>  The appendix of the Roman Ritual has a blessing of salt for the use of animals and another in honour of St. Hubert. The Roman Pontifical orders salt to be blessed and mixed in the water (mixed in turn with ashes and wine) for the consecration of a church. This is also from the Gregorian Sacramentary. Again salt (not specially blessed) may be used for purifying the fingers after sacred unctions.|`|AA10057370	Why do atheists and antichristian make up such non-sense.<br>  No christian baptism has salt in it.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	Purity and constancy|`|AA10034051	In the Catholic Church, salt is or has been used in a variety of purifying rituals. In fact, until Vatican II, a small taste of salt was placed on a baby's lip at his or her baptism. Jesus called his disciples "the Salt of the Earth." <br>  <br>  The idea of holy water as a sacramental in the Roman Catholic Church is best illustrated by looking at the idea of what a sacramental is. The word sacrament is derived from the Latin, "sacra" meaning holy, treasured, cherished, or sacred. Holy water is water that is blessed by a priest or member of the clergy or can even be blessed by a deacon or believing member of any faith. The key element contained in holy water is also significant. It is the basic element of salt. The key element of salt is the first and perhaps one of the most important symbolic substances involved in holy water. Classically it was considered to contain the same numerical qualities for the Hebrew people as the very Name of God. In addition in Christian scripture Jesus is seen as indicating the importance of being as "Salt of the earth."The element of water of course has it's own symbology as well. In the classic holy water of Christianity it represents the water of Life Jesus Christ, as well as cleansing, baptism, washes away your sins and many other symbols. It is a purifying and cleansing agent especially when mixed with salt.|`|6jAVElX7aa	I have never heard of salt being used in baptisms. It is done with water, signifying a cleansing. Maybe some use it as Jesus said, to those who believe in Him, "Ye are the salt of the earth."|`|KILFoc6kaa	I was baptized in water, not salt....|`|AA10192697	I'm Catholic and we don't use salt in our baptisms.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Part of the old Catholic baptism rite:<br>  <br>  The Imposition of Salt<br>   <br>  Now the priest puts a little blessed salt in the candidate's mouth. Salt is the symbol of that wisdom which gives a relish for the sweetness of divine nourishment; preserves, by the teaching of the Gospel, from the corruption of sin, and prevents evil passions from growing in men's souls. Adult catechumens might be signed on the brow, ears, eyes, nostrils, mouth, breast, and between the shoulders before the imposition of salt. If this procedure is followed, afterwards the candidate will kneel, recite the Our Father several times, and a Cross is made on his forehead, first by the sponsor and then by the priest.<br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.fisheaters.com/baptism2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fisheaters.com/baptism2.html</a>|`|8IHfytEvaa	Unless you get baptized in the Ocean, salt plays no role in a baptism.<br>  <br>  Baptism means to immerse in water some one who is a newly converted follower of Jesus.|`|1VuQNpWbaa	Salt?

Lack of hope leads to the condition we call depression: flatness of emotion, disorientation, lack of energy, and impaired ability (sometimes the complete inabilty) to perform tasks. The antidote to depression is hope, which energizes people in the same manner that water makes a wilting plant spring to life. Christian hope promises far more than just an antidote to depression, it re-orients the entire direction of a person's life. <br>  <br>  This hope is completely foreign to a world that does not walk with God. The only people who have some grasp of hope in the same manner as Christians are believing Jews, the people from whom Christians inherit their hope, the "hope of Israel" (Acts 28:20, 26:4-8). The apostle Paul explained to Felix, "according to the Way which they call a sect I do serve the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law, and that is written in the Prophets; having a hope in God, which these men (the Jews) cherish themselves, that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked" (Acts 24:14-15). This resurrection would occur on the "Day of the Lord," a day when God would rescue His people and initiate a new age in which He would abolish evil and rule over His people forever. <br>  <br>  The difference between the hope of Jews and the hope of Christians is, however, profound in one important manner. Jews have the promises of God and wonderful examples of God's work in history, such as the Passover. Christians have all of this and also the physical evidence that this hope that is alive and sure in the resurrection of Christ (Acts 26:22-23, 17:31, I Peter 1:3). In all truthfulness, it is not fully correct to say that the Jews do not have the resurrection of Christ, because Jesus Christ, a Jew according to the flesh, is God's "Anointed One," the Messiah promised to and long awaited by Jews; and the Gospel is the "good news" to the Jew first, and only then to the Gentiles (Romans 1:16). It is more precise to say that many Jews do not recognize the resurrection of Christ, and in that manner do not "have" it. Christian hope, then, is centered upon trust in God, focused on a future time of deliverance, evidenced by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and helps determine how Christians live their lives. <br>  <br>  The hope of Christ's return and the coming "Day of the Lord" with all of its wonders and rewards Paul called "the blessed hope" (Titus 2:13) and spoke of non-Christians as those who "have no hope" (I Thessalonians 4:13). It isn't that there isn't anything worth hoping for on earth. There are good and beautiful things in this world, things that God placed here for us to enjoy (I Timothy 4:1-5). It isn't even that there cannot be a growth in righteousness on earth prior to Christ's return. There have been many occasions since the ministry of Christ where the Kingdom of God has forced back the kingdom of darkness. But this world has nothing to offer when it comes to the ultimate things. In fact, even the salvation offered in this age is incomplete. When we so often speak as if it were, we rob people of the hope that God means to sustain us in our journey through life. <br>  <br>  Peter spoke of a "salvation ready to be revealed" and told Christians to "fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Christ" (I Peter 1:5, 13). The author of Hebrews pointed out, "But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him (Jesus)" (Hebrews 2:8). Paul spoke of "the hope laid up for you in heaven" (Colossians 1:5), taught that even those Christians who have died feel a sense of incompleteness until they are joined with their resurrected and glorified bodies (II Corinthians 5:1-4), and that even the creation "longs" for the Day of the Lord in the sense that the time when things decay and die will end (Romans 8:19-23). All of this is consistent with the teaching of Jesus, who taught us to lay up for ourselves treasures in heaven, not on earth (Matthew 6:19-20). <br>  <br>  Yes, healing is in the atonement (Isaiah 53:5). But complete health can never be achieved on earth, only with the resurrection. Yes, there will be full reward for everyone who sacrifices for the Lord (Matthew 19:29). But it will be given at a time when Jesus judges His servants after His return. Yes, there will come a time when there is no more suffering (Revelation 21:3-7). But not until evil and death have been conquered at Christ's return. Until then, there will be healings, there will be blessings, and there will be comfort, but they will be sufficient, not complete, in this age. And those who try to act as if they will be find the difficulties of this age unfathomable. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, for those who place their faith in God and look to the future He promises, there is a cleansing of one's mind and spirit.

n5DlXdsCaa	Well, a long time ago (not sure of the year, but I don't think it's that important to the story) there was a king who decided nobody could get married because he felt that when his men were distracted by their wives back home, they didn't fight as well. Of course, the idea was bogus, but that's what happened. There was this priest named Valentine, and he would marry couples in secret. He became St. Valentine, and now we have V-day. A Valentine is just a person you spend that day with, i.e. "will you be my Valentine?" <br>  Actually, it's kind of funny that they say that because Valentine himself wasn't in love with anyone or anything.

k8LHyfc0aa	I wouldn't worry so much to say the name in an english way, because danes would recognize the name - But I have tried explain it here below, if you really wanna have a go at it. <br>  <br>  The first syllable is no problem, but the last can be difficult to explain in writing - and difficult to pronounce for foreigners (depending on your nationality).<br>  <br>  'Got' <br>  <br>  The same way you say 'got' in for ex. " I got it "<br>  <br>  'fred'<br>  <br>  This has two sounds that are difficult to pronounce unless you know the language - I don't know your nationality, but I'm expecting it to be english?!? The F and E, just like you would say them in english..<br>  <br>  The 'r' sound is pronounced sort of in the throat. In english when you pronounce r's - you use the tongue - In Denmark we make a kind of noise in the throat - Kind of like clearing your throat or getting rid of something that bothers you - Charming, right?!<br>  <br>  The 'd' sound is a little easier. It's a soft 'd' which is tongue between your teeth, almost like 'th' in " the " or " either " - This is just at the end of the word. It's not near as noticeable as the 'th' sound though. Just kind of indicated. The same actually goes for the 'r' sound, but you know how to overdo it, before you can make the right sound I think.<br>  <br>  I think you really need to hear it said, in order to copy it - so as I said, you might just say in the english way - the way you would say Gotfred. Let me know if you got it ;o) Hope it helped, just a bit..

The law was instituted to show that men cannot by their self efforts fulfill the law and this requires God to send His only begotten Son into the world to fulfill the law by dying on the cross for us and shedding His blood to obtain for us forgiveness if sins and the gift of righteousness in Him.  We have victory over sin and righteousness only through faith in Jesus Christ for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to all those who believe (Romans 10:4):<br>  <br>  Galatians 3:24,25   Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.

Isn't it the same as take away the ability to make our own choice? God give human free choice so we are not just mindless creatures, but the prize being we will be able to do wrong. Thus hurt others, the punishment is for you to pay for the pain you cause others, but the ability of free will itself is not wrong. Law exist to punish the sin while maintain our ability to choose for ourselve. If you think law is wrong and promote sin, then do you think not be able to do wrong is a better choice?|`|CBUPymktaa	in my opinion one of its purposes other than that is to show that its impossible not to sin .. and since you now know its wrong its really a sin .. like huge in your face big sin ..|`|7XsxarORaa	If you've ever told somebody to not turn around...|`|AA11989753	Breaking the law means going further than what the law allows. If you see a stop sign, and drive through the stop sign without stopping, you have broken the law. The stop sign cannot "make" you stop. The stop sign can only alert you that you have transgressed the law.<br>  <br>  God gave us His laws because they are His standard of "goodness." God's standard of "goodness" is moral perfection in thought, word and deed. The Ten Commandments are to serve to us as a mirror that reflect to us our true image, what we really are....we are SINNERS!<br>  <br>  The Law cannot save but rather should send you running into the arms of the Saviour after you have seen your true reflection.<br>  <br>  The Bible says,"The law of the LORD is PERFECT CONVERTING the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure; making wise the simple." Psalm 19:7 Many Christians fail to use God's law in witnessing to the "unsaved" because they fear it will "scare" them off. Jesus Christ did not hold back in warning people about spending eternity in Hell and spoke of Hell more than any other subject.<br>  <br>  The function of God's law is to STOP the sinner's mouth of justification.<br>  <br>  "Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. <br>  Rom 3:20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin."<br>  <br>  The Apostle Paul said ,"I had not known sin but for the law." Romans 7:7. See, without the law, how will a sinner know what God expects?<br>  <br>  Here's how to tell...Take a look into God's "Holy mirror" and see if you really are such a "good" person after all. Most people think they are, just ask them.<br>  <br>  Have you ever told a lie, stolen anything, or looked with lust? Have you ever hated anyone or used God's name in vain? If you have then on judgment day you will be guilty of being a lying, thief, an adulterer at heart, a murderer, and a blasphemer. That is only 5 of the 10 commandments! Jesus said, "You have heard it said of old,"Thou shalt not commit adultery, but I say to you to look upon a woman with lust, you have committed adultery already in your heart." Jesus also said,"He who hates his brother is a murderer." Jesus also said that all liars and thieves will have their part in the lake of fire and that he will not hold anyone blameless who takes His name in vain.<br>  <br>  The Bible also says that whosoever shall keep the whole law and offend at one point is guilty of all. James 2:10<br>  <br>  So you see, when you see that God requires PERFECTION to get into Heaven and how short we all come of His "glory" That "glory" He speaks of, is His RIGHTEOUSNESS! That righteousness of God is only found ONE PLACE and that is through His ONLY BEGOTTEN SON JESUS CHRIST.<br>  <br>  "For ALL have sinned and come short of the glory of God." Romans 3:23<br>  <br>  Jesus saith unto him,"I am THE WAY, and THE TRUTH, and THE LIFE; NO MAN commeth to the Father but by me." John 14:6<br>  <br>  "Except a man be born again; he cannot see the kingdom of God." (John 3:3) In order to be born again, you must call upon the name of the Lord to save you.<br>  <br>  "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. <br>  <br>  For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." Romans 10:9-10 (KJV)<br>  <br>  Those who put their trust/faith in the Saviour, are no longer under the law, but SAVED BY GRACE.  The law's function is to STOP THE SINNER'S MOUTH OF JUSTIFICATION SO THAT THE WHOLE WORLD MAY BECOME GUILTY BEFORE GOD. Romans 3:19|`|T497f0iwaa	I disagree with your idea.  It seems you are taking a "Romantic" position -- that without governments, or rules, humans would be peaceful. <br>  <br>  I think humans are naturally violent.

Sin was there before the law but it was unknown.  The primary function of the law is to expose man of their sin.  "there was much sin" or some version translates " sin abounds" referred to sin made known.  Rom. 3:20 second half says "through the law is the clear knowledge of sin".  Rom. 5:13 says "For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not charged to one's account where there is no law"<br>  <br>  For example, without the traffic law, we would think that speeding is ok.  But when the law is made known and the speed limit signs are put up, we knew that speeding is wrong.  Furthermore, people were caught speeding.  This does not mean that people who speed increased but just that the law exposed them. <br>  <br>  It is the same with Rom. 7:8, without the law sin is dead means that if there were no law, it is as if there is no sin.<br>  <br>  The first answerer is right, law exposes us that we are sinners, we cannot fully fulfill the law.  Gal. 3:15-29 shows us that law is our custodian or child-conductor that protects us (human beings) before Christ came ... it eventually leads is to Christ that we might be justified through faith and not out of works.|`|qMCHLrKCaa	One of the seven Noahide commandments is that all nations establish a legal system, and the purpose of any legal system is to preserve social order.  In others words, we have legal systems (whatever the basis of those laws might be) so people can settle disputes in an orderly fashion rather than going into the streets with baseball bats as a way of settling their arguments.  In a world where the love of G-d and one's neighbor was sufficient to preserve social relations, law would not be necessary, but that is not the world as it exists.  Jesus recognized this when He stated that He came not to abrogate the law but to fulfill it--in other words, to provide a way to transform the world.  But, the transformation of the world is a work in progress and not yet an achievement.<br>  <br>  The law does not create sin, which is an alienation from G-d.  It is sin that requires law.  We choose to act in such a way as either to alienate ourselves from G-d or not, but the very act of choosing--by which we fulfill our purpose of being rational agents in the image of G-d--causes us to rely on our own judgment rather than on G-d.  The very action by which we achieve our telos as imago Dei alienates us from total reliance on G-d and is an act of rebellion, which necessitates law.  This is man's existential condition, from which we could only be rescued by G-d becoming Man and participating in that same existential paradox.<br>  <br>  Grace be unto and peace.

B5cuNTxQaa	For long centuries people believed what they were told about religion. Every facet of their daily life was submersed in it. For instance; a rose was red to remind them of the blood of Christ, the thorns were there to remind us of the sins of the devil and grass was green to symbolize the emerald of sincerity. Every moment of the day was that way. They were warned never to question their faith (or anything else). The threats were real and punishment severe. <br>  <br>  But now it is part of our culture to question everything, always ask “why” and look for alternatives. Each generation moves farther from religion and superstition, more so in developed countries.<br>  <br>  I believe that we will always have religious groups among us.

Secondly, your references to evolution, abiogenesis, the big bang, etc., reveal a metaphysical assumption of naturalism.<br>  <br>  Now, if you were to tae some college level philosophy, you would see that these two philosophical systems have also been debunked.  And you know the old saying about people who live in glass houses, don't you?  Likewise, people who maintain unwarranted worldviews shouldn't attack the worldviews of others.|`|nDBXLvhraa	Yes, my thoughts exactly. It is amazing how many people are so childish and ignorant to believe such a thing. However, I think religion should be abandoned alltoghter as it is simply a way to control people for evil motives. Look at the wars going on, all in the name of god, allah, etc, etc. <br>  <br>  We must understand that the earth is our home, which means the entire planet must live here. If all the different groups try to conquer the others the result will be the death of the planet. <br>  <br>  If we are all divided by religion then we can never truly attain our full potential. Its called synergy, which bascially means two people working together can achieve more than two people working individually. Now apply that on a global scale of 6 billion people, wow. If we all came to the realization that relgion doesnt matter and just loved and accpeted one another for what they are, then I would die a happy man.

dewaqzgPaa	So, I'm guessing that you are worried your son is going to be gay? Most young children enjoy doing things, that they see other people doing, or looks fun and appealing. He sees it as another game to play, or way to have fun. I don't understand why people see it as okay, for girls to play boy games, but if boys play girl type things everyone gets worried?

It's a stage in a child's development (there's a name for it I'm sure, I just can't remember).  He's basically trying to find out who he is.  Support his curiosity.  He'll most likely be starting Kinder soon, so maybe you can help him transition to "this is what a boy wears".  I teach 3rd grade, and out of the 16 boys I have 5 who like pink.  They wear pink polo shirts or t-shirts, and say they actually like it.  They're made fun of by some other kids, but it doesn't bother them.  It's perfectly normal, despite what some may say.  He's also going to want to play with baby dolls, and again that's normal.  Studies say that boys who play with dolls will grow up to become caring and loving men.  There's some kinders at my school who play with the baby dolls during free time, and it's totally supported by the teachers.  Good luck!|`|6c344a4f8d76590d6dc465b029ec16dcaa	It's okay, it sound funny but he's so little, let him have fun.<br>  Boy usualy change these fun times with other things, by the time they are 10-12.

And since you are smart and Beautiful, do you really want to be with someone that can only make you feel good by telling you lies or do you get up and look for someone that truly is beautiful and the things he tells you are the truth.

And perhaps this is better for you, it'll hurt for awhile, but after that passes you'll be able to meet a man that isn't afraid of sharing with the world how much he loves you.  You'll feel better, I promise, it'll just take a little while.<br>  <br>  I didn't mean you were trying to break them up, I was just saying that its difficult to keep up a gay relationship when the world thinks you're straight, and that denile was the result of that.
8ubAwaGCaa	When the legs are relaxed, the person's weight is supported on the bones of the wrist pressing down on spikes between the bones of the forearm.  This causes, forgive the expression, excruciating pain.  When the victim can no longer endure it, he can't help trying to stand up.  This tears through the tissues of his feet, and as he rises, his lacerated back scrapes along the rough wood of the cross.<br>  <br>  The intense agony and the eventually open wounds lead to dehydration and terrible thirst.<br>  <br>  The pleurum -- and possibly the lungs -- gradually fills with fluid, and eventually the heart is compressed.  <br>  <br>  As the victim weakens, his struggles lessen, and the accumulation of fluid accelerates until finally the heart cannot beat any longer or no longer has the strength to do so.<br>  <br>  It is a gruesome way to die.  There's nothing good about it, and an uninterrupted crucifixion can go on for days.  Jesus' death was somewhat out of the ordinary in (a) being so quick; and (b) his ability to shout loudly immediately prior to death.|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	It's a horrible death.  The word "excruciating" is derived from this method.  Below is a link to a good article about what happens.|`|UinOWcMUaa	painful suffication -- :(<br>  <br>  <br>  The left foot is now pressed backward against the right foot, and with both feet extended, toes down, a nail is driven through the arch of each, leaving the knees moderately flexed. The Victim is now crucified. As He slowly sags down with more weight on the nails in the wrists excruciating pain shoots along the fingers and up the arms to explode in the brain -- the nails in the writs are putting pressure on the median nerves. As He pushes Himself upward to avoid this stretching torment, He places His full weight on the nail through His feet. Again there is the searing agony of the nail tearing through the nerves between the metatarsal bones of the feet. <br>  <br>  At this point, as the arms fatigue, great waves of cramps sweep over the muscles, knotting them in deep, relentless, throbbing pain. With these cramps comes the inability to push Himself upward. Hanging by his arms, the pectoral muscles are paralyzed and the intercostal muscles are unable to act. Air can be drawn into the lungs, but cannot be exhaled. Jesus fights to raise Himself in order to get even one short breath. Finally, carbon dioxide builds up in the lungs and in the blood stream and the cramps partially subside. Spasmodically, he is able to push Himself upward to exhale and bring in the life-giving oxygen. It was undoubtedly during these periods that He uttered the seven short sentences recorde<br>  <br>  Hours of limitless pain, cycles of twisting, joint-rending cramps, intermittent partial asphyxiation, searing pain where tissue is torn from His lacerated back as He moves up and down against the rough timber. Then another agony begins...A terrible crushing pain deep in the chest as the pericardium slowly fills with serum and begins to compress the heart.|`|IFQFt25naa	Theone78 & scotgirl60 have over all good answers so I am not going to repeat or “nit pick” the details listed in the answers.<br>   <br>  But I would like to add one extra detail about the placement of the nails/spikes in the hands/wrists.  <br>  <br>  Depending on how much extra pain they wanted to cause the person being crucified (as if general certification wasn’t painful enough) they would place the nail in different positions.  (As well as positioning the body different ways.)<br>  <br>  If they just wanted to hold the person to the cross/backboard the spike/nail would be placed in the wrist. Between the bones of the wrist so that the person could not pull the nail though their wrist nor could it be ripped out (left, right, forwards or backwards) from the weight or struggling of the person.<br>  <br>  However, if they wanted to add exponentially to the suffering they would tie the arms (with rope, or something similar) to the backboard to hold the person in place, then put the nail though the palm of hand.   (This is likely what was done to Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.)<br>  <br>  One of the nerves in the center of the palm of our hands if it is severed causes the entire arm to feel like it is literally on fire every time it is moved or anything touches it.  The really “cute part” with about doing this, the person does not pass out from the pain caused by the severed nerve.   Can you even begin to imagine being on that cross, and every time you move to breath every millimeter of your arms literally feel like they have been set on fire (or that your arms have been covered in red hot coals)?  In addition to everything else that was happening and all the other pain.<br>  <br>  But regardless of the method they used; crucifixion was a horribly painful, agonizingly slow way to die.<br>  <br>  May Our Creator watch over you and your family.|`|NLinPsyhaa	Suffocation.

ugzcxnzKaa	I'm with you.  Discipline seems almost non-existent these days.  No rules, no consequences, no pleases and thank yous - little savages who will grow up thinking the world will bow at their feet.  Get a grip, parents and do some PARENTING.  That means you too, Dad.|`|3GHXk05saa	Well, parenting is work and the job never ends. People are lazy. Some want to be a friend instead of a parent.<br>  The kids are certainly going to pay the price. They need limits and if they don't get them they're lost. Poor babies.|`|CO6Yc7PDaa	I know what you mean! it's so odd. Is it the media or is it because the parents are scared the child will call the police or something? Nowadays, most kids are disrespectful to one another including their parents and/or elders. I'm happy my parents fully told me off when I was a kid because the parents today need some lessons on raising their children. It gets really annoying|`|yhfG07Jtaa	Grow up. When you were a child, people didn't timidly "glare." They addressed themselves politely to the adult in charge. <br>  When a gang of children disrupts the scene you're paying for, speak politely to the teacher. When a child kicks your seat, speak politely to the parent.<br>  It's difficult and embarassing to speak up, but it's what the previous generation did. Just yesterday I had to ask a woman at the city park not to pick armloads of daffodils and take them home, those are the public's flowers, etc. I was very uncomfortable and didnt want a confrontation, but I had to accept that if it mattered to me, it was my job to say so.<br>  The wild kids and their caretakers won't know it bothers anybody unless you verbalize.|`|AA11788494	Try addressing the child instead of the parents.  Then the child will be embarrassed too.<br>  <br>  I will add that in church one day, my friend's daughter was slapping her so I took her hand and smacked it and said no.  She stopped.

I see that I did nothing wrong.|`|AEMTb3vdaa	The bad parenting syndrome really got a good start back about 1958 when parents were told it was unhealthy to say "no" or in any way discipline children.

Although the new laws and eyes set upon child abuse are doing good things, many people fear that their methods of punishment would be viewed as "abusive" and earn them trouble.  My own parents refused to discipline us in public because my mother was afraid to have social services called in.  As soon as we got home, though, I was grounded or spanked.<br>  <br>  2) People don't care.  Most of the parents today are under the impression that the child is not misbehaving, simply "expressing themselves" and if you DARE tell their child what to do or how to behave, then you're the bad person for squelching their individuality.<br>  <br>  3) Those parents were also without discipline, for whatever reason.  I recently watched a movie and the FATHER AND SON were talking throughout the entire first half.  I finally stood up and intentionally blocked their view.<br>  <br>  The man got pissed off and told me to sit down so he could watch the film; I told him to shut up so I could hear it.  <br>  <br>  That worked out rather nicely, actually.  They both got the picture.<br>  <br>  4) The children are simply brats.  I've known several children whose siblings are absolute angels, and whose parents are strict and disciplinary.

9hI653b5aa	perhaps it could be the symbolism of that which must be sacrificed in order to placate the beast or even the sacrifice a god makes for his followers a constant in most religions
AAgX0SDcaa	I think it is not right to harass people on the job, at school, or to hurt children at all. But even bigots need to express themselves verbally in some fashion, for a few reasons. First, it is good to know what people really think deep down inside. That way you have a choice sometimes of whether to deal with them or not get involved with them in the first place  and perhaps save yourself some time.  Second, if they don't freely express themselves, they will become very hostile with their pent-up feelings, and their hostility will creep out in some other perhaps more destructive ways. Third, if we see a truly bad example we can use it as an example of what not to become. Archie Bunker comes to mind in this instance. Seeing someone that extreme showed me how ugly a deeply hard-headed and bigoted person can be.  Fourth, political correctness is a slippery slope. Kind of reminds me of Communism where people are scared to speak their mind without being punished. If everyone only says what they think will be safest, then they can be controlled easier. Fifth, I heard many hateful and cruel remarks about my ancestors and also my religious beliefs after moving to Oklahoma during the 1960's.  I believe that those experiences, negative as they were, built my compassion and love for people who are different than me. My belief was and still is that we are to love our neighbors as ourselves.  My compassion for others different than me has afforded me many wonderful opportunities that I wouldn't have otherwise have known.  So something great came out of whatever pain I felt back in the 60's dealing with those bigoted people.  And one of my best friends back then changed her heart, she would say bigoted things that her father taught her, in her later years she came to an understanding that it wasn't right for one Christian to harbor hateful feelings for another Christian and become good friends with a young lady she would have shunned in her younger years.|`|1NO10YfPaa	Kudos to Rose of Cimarron and Keeprock; to which I would like to add, as a Liberal living in a very red state, that there is a political correctness among Conservatives too.  There are just different sensitivities.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I think when a year ago, during the Christmas season, it was deemed<br>  politically incorrect to give salutations beginning with, "Merry Christmas", that was where I drew the line. "Seasons' Greetings" is<br>  fine, but to have it mandated by popular or public opinion, is not my<br>  idea of having  freedom of speech. Nor do I expect to be ridiculed<br>  for wishing someone a Merry Christmas. <br>     There was such a bleakness to that season. The absence of <br>  decorations on the outside or inside of stores, made it seem like any<br>  other time of year. And I have yet to understand it. If it had anything<br>  to do with the fighting in Iraq, that still didn't make sense. While<br>  WWII was raging, people still put up decorations, and wished others<br>  Merry Christmas. But then, there was much pride in our nation and<br>  what it stood for. <br>     As for other terms that are politically incorrect, we've always said<br>  what the majority have used, but we are sensitive to others, and we<br>  do employ our manners, if there is a proper or non insulting word that<br>  works more appropriately around sensitive people, we use them. Do unto others..........!|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	I read it a lot about being politically correct when it comes to the internet.<br>  I hear of it none at all in everyday life.<br>  I do not guard my speech and have yet to be the object of persecution.<br>  I have my free speech.

It may actually be the ruination of out country if it isn't stopped.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	I work with kids at a school so already we have limits on what we can say. I feel they are  good limits because the main criteria is that we do not say or do anything that would make someone else feel bad or uncomfortable. It is just plain being nice. I don't see why people can't be civil to each other. I have no desire to  hinder any ones thought processes or change their opinions at all. My goal as a teacher is to get kids to think.

It slowly built from the many voices of social unrest that started during the Great Depression.  PC is nothing more than showing some consideration for those who do not look/think/believe/love/worship as you do.  "True free speech" has never meant the right to say anything you want.  e.g. you can not make a false report to the police, you can not commit slander or libel.  But I don't know why anyone here should worry.  From the rude, racist, homophobic, sexist, xenophobic, insulting, and just plain stupid remarks on Yahoo Answers this is obviously a safe haven of Political Uncorrectness.  BTW, I used the word "you" generically.  It is not a personal reference to you, Jim.<br>  <br>  Let me add:  PC can  go to far, such as the people who insist that a manhole cover be called a "personhole" cover.  But I'd rather hear idiotic words like personhole cover than the ugly ones that were, and still are, used.

As for all who say that have made it work for them, I really have to question whether those supposedly Christians, have the gift of the Holy Spirit living inside of them.  After a person is re-born a Christian, they experience and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.  It is the Holy Spirit that opens our eyes, ears  and softens our hearts.  When we fall more and more in love with God, we find it difficult to have anything in common with a non-believer, only to just pray and have compassion on them.  As for anyone that thinks of Christians as a turn off because they want to speak of the bible or God all the time, it's called being in love.  The definition of love is God, God is love.  Jesus was the coolest, who ever walked this planet.

s34GP3Ioaa	I haven't seen the movie yet but I heard that Penn did an outstanding job portraying Milk.  Having lived in the bay area most of my life, I remember the day that Milk and Miscone were murdered.  It felt like somebody pulled the rug from underneath me.  After all of the struggling to obtain some rights and getting our 1st gay person in politics and some looser like Dan White could just walk into city hall and blow away the mayor of SF and Milk was shocking.  At that time I was co-owner of a flower shop in Oakland and we sent an 8' floral wreath to Milks funeral home.  I still remember the sad and somber mood in the bay area.  Of course that all changed when Dan White got a slap on the wrist with the newly invented "Twinky Defense".  The day of that sentencing the gay's went nuts and rioted around city hall and dozens of cop cars were turned over and lit on fire.  I assume all  of this is in the movie....right?

( A loving relationship between same sex partners) That type of orientation did not exist in Biblical times.  We know the authors of those passages were NOT prophets so they could not see the future. What they were writing about was what they had seen in their time. The same sex practices back then had to do with worship of pagan fertility gods or the humiliation of a foe. It had nothing to do with love. <br>  <br>   Sodom and Gomorrah were about the humiliation of a foe.  They viewed the two outsiders as spies from other cities and they wanted to humiliate them and send them back to their city. It said EVERY man showed up to have sex with these men.

GBKaftrJaa	Before Jesus' crucifixion only priests from the Levite tribe who had made themselves holy by sacrifices, bathing, and proper attire could go behind that veil.  The veil was to protect one from going into the holiness of God.<br>  <br>  God's presence is wonderful to the righteous but it's deadly to anyone who is not righteous. That's why when Moses led the Israelites to the promised land, he was the only one allowed near Mt Sinai.  God warned that no one else should go near the mountain, not even the animals because God would meet Moses there and anyone else might die if they so much as touched the base of the mountain.  The rest of the Israelites were not holy enough to go into God's presence because of their flaws, faults, and doubts.<br>  <br>  God also said his presence would be in the temple and gave the rules for who could enter the temple and who could go behind the veil and he warned that anyone else might die if they went there.  The rules about being holy enough to go behind the veil are covered in Exodus chapters 25-27. <br>  <br>  And so by ripping the veil that protected people from God's presence means that we are now saved from our sins and able to approach God's presence as we never could before then!  We no longer have to go to a priest for the priest to offer our sacrifices to atone for our sins, they are all atoned for.|`|tManvxfQaa	It was to show us we could enter the Holy of Holies for ourselves Cause Jesus opened the door to us to come in.....<br>  And we can now with Boldness come before Him with our petitions<br>  For HE makes intercessions for us daily|`|AA10351261	This was from Old Testament times--before Jesus was born.<br>  Only the High Priest was allowed behind the veil and that (I think)  was only once a year. When the veil was torn, it signified that all people had access to the same things that the High Priest did. There was no longer a separation from God to the people. The birth of Jesus opened the way. Jesus had come in the flesh and lived among, and for, all people. It's sort of like knowing Jesus is now an "open door policy."|`|QoTfQfRFaa	There were 3 sections to the tabernacle. The last section was called the holiest of hollies, this is where the ark of the covenant was kept. The veil was a solid curtain that was staked and tied at the corners. ONE time a year the high priest could enter after he went through a special ritual. the other priest tied a rope to his leg in case the Lord struck him dead for not being clean. (yes the Lord would do that) The interesting part about the veil is that the Lord moved the priest from one side to the other, there were no entries through the curtain. When the veil was torn (I believe at the same time Jesus was speared) it let every one know that ANYONE could enter into the presence of God at anytime.<br>  <br>  ---- Knowledge comes before understanding, then comes wisdom ----|`|faceb0da83e7b433b86d3ae6836703f3aa	We can now enter into the Holy of Holy's, enter in by the blood of the Lamb.<br>  <br>  The atonement for our sins has been made, and we can enter in the place of Gods presence.|`|0PvpGjSqaa	it was supposed to symbolize that people could now be directly in the presence of god and that they were no longer slaves to religious law.
3L4citcnaa	The title of Reverend is just that, a title, much like one who attends medical school receives the title of Doctor upon their graduation.<br>  <br>  When a person graduates from seminary and is ordained in the protestant Church, he or she receives the title of Rev. John Smith. <br>  <br>  However, they are often called pastors, or ministers instead. The Rev. is just a formality. <br>  <br>  For example, at my church, we have a minister called Pastor Joe, whose ordination certificate reads Rev. John Smith (I don't feel comfortable writing his name down here). <br>  <br>  And you are right, only God is God. Ministers, pastors, or reverends are just vessels of God's Word, to help convey understanding to His people. Though I believe Catholics see priests as slightly divine?|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Valid question.

There are some areas here in the United States which will welcome you with open arms, but again not like your native country.  As far as landscape, the United States has so many wonderful places to visit, explore, and discover it truly depends on what you consider “beautiful” and where you are traveling to.  Do you want to see the lights of NYC, the glamour of Vegas, the wetlands (or white beaches of Pensacola) of Florida, the flat prairies of the Great Plains, the touring mountains of Colorado, the Northern Lights of Alaska … the discoveries are endless.

But when you think about it enough you start to realize this... God is spiritual and intangible, He is outside of space and time.  So it would be hard for us to even understand time or space in the spiritual realm if it were to be explained to us because we live in a different dimension.<br>  <br>  Then you might consider, "where did the universe come from?"  But this question probably came first although not necessarily.  Comparing the two it might make you smile.  If the universe has either always existed or came up out of nothing, how is the idea that there has been no beginning to an intangible and unchanging God hard to comprehend?<br>  <br>  God has no beginning because outside of the decay of matter, energy and our universe... there is no time.... no beginning or end.|`|gOwakeM1aa	The Word of God in the Bible answers our most intimate questions how we must live our life.

Please don't stop reading just because i am an atheist.<br>  <br>  Christians always ask me, if there is no god, then how did we get here.<br>  It is silly, because if we needed a god to create our existence than that means that god needs a creator for his existance.<br>  <br>  Through much reasoning, i think i may have the answer, not saying that i do, because once someone says they know something, then they become close minded (most christians who no matter how much they say it, don't know that there is a god.)<br>  <br>  I believe that there cannot be nothing, but cannot have something without a creator, to answer this, i believe that there is positive and negative matter in the universe which adds up to zero, nothing.  I believe that it is this way because it is the only way that the universe can work.<br>  <br>  I also believe that time works in a loop, never beginning and never ending,  i believe that time is simply the placement of all particles in space at a given instant.  If time works in a loop there is no need for something to start or stop it, eliminating the need for a God.<br>  <br>  I believe that after you die, time goes through a rotation and you are born again and live the exact same life over again with no recollection of the last life.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions of my theory please email me.

THEN you would ask ... well, what created that something?<br>  <br>  It could go on forever.<br>  <br>  You can pursue this question forever but the Bible has told you all that you need to know.

"Who made God?" can't be answered feel justified in denying that God exist. But the question of who made God can be answered by simply looking at space and asking, "Does space have an end?" Obviously, it doesn't. If there is a brick wall with "The end" written on it, the question arises, "What is behind that wall?" Strain the mind though it may, we have to believe, have faith, that space has no beginning and no end. He is eternal. The Bible informs us that time is a dimension that God created, into which man was subjected: 2 Timothy 1:9 says, "[God] who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began." Another example, Titus 1:2 says, "...in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before time began." It even tells us one day time will no longer exist. That will be known as eternity. God himself dwells outside of the dimension He created. He dwells inside eternity and is not subject to time. God spoke history before it came it came into being. He can move trough time as a man flips through a history book. Because we live in the realm of time, logic and reason demand that everything must have a beginning and an end. We can understand the concept of God's eternal nature the same way we understand the concept of space having no beginning and end, by faith. We simply have to believe they are so, even though such thoughts put a strain on our distinctly insufficient cerebrum. Some atheist claim that if God can be infinite, the the universe can also be without a beginning. The illogical presumption here is that the universe has an intelligence in and of itself, because intelligence is required to carry out the order we call creation. If that is correct, the only logical conclusion would be that the universe somehow has the ability to think and to create from nothing. But then we would be describing God. So, in essence, some atheist are presuming the universe is God, or Creator. That can only cause us to conclude the obvious: Some are quite willing to accept that there is some kind of God, creative intelligence, but just don't like the God of the Bible, or any God who has a moral code and condemns those who violate it.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	He was created by his mother|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	Our minds do not comprehend the concept of eternity.God always was and always will be.Just because you can not understand it does not change the truth !|`|KXQVRQdjaa	If your father doesn't think that Christians aren't supposed to ask questions about things they don't understand, why did God give us these lovely brains?<br>  <br>  This is one of those questions no one can answer, but it's great that you're asking it.  People should think about things instead of just believing what other people tell them.  Think about this:  All your life people will tell you things, and about nine times out of ten, the things they tell you will be wrong.  That includes things about God.<br>  <br>  A lot of people think it's sinful to ask questions about God, because they think we should just blindly believe.  But remember that we are all humans, and no human speaks for God.  Some people may tell you they know what God thinks, but how can they?  They're human just like you.  If they tell you something is in the Bible, look it up for yourself and make sure it's there, because there are a lot of people who say stuff is in the Bible because they think it should be, or they vaguely remember that it was there.  If they can't tell you the book, verse, and chapter, that human being is the only one saying it, and they are no wiser than you are.<br>  <br>  Keep asking questions, because that's the way that you honor the brain that God gave you.|`|oihouY7Naa	The creator of God is us.

I believe that we worship Him in spirit and in truth, so asking questions like that is not a problem. We read the Bible so that we can understand God. We may never understand the nature of God completely, because we are in the flesh now. To understand God who is spiritual, you need to be spiritual. To understand God you need to be born again. Ask your dad about that.<br>  When you become born again, then you can understand spiritual things, and when you read the Bible you can see things the way God sees things, because the Holy Spirit is in you.<br>  This sounds like I'm avoiding the question. But it's important because you would never understand my answer without the Holy Spirit, and it takes our entire lifetime to mentally grasp who this awesome God is, and graps God's love for us by giving his only begotten son.<br>  But to answer your question directly. God does not need a cause because he transcends our dimensions which are time, space, matter, and energy. Within those dimensions time, space, matter, and energy, everything needs a cause. So the universe needs a cause because it is bound by those laws of the need for cause. So the maker of all things does not need a cause. If you look at it any other way, you will end up never solving this mystery. But the mystery will also never be solved by using our fleshly minds, becuase they are corrupt. Only the Holy Spirit can show us these things.<br>  I don't mean to put your dad down, but I wish he had tried to explain it.<br>  I believe your question is sincere.|`|m9vr74gyaa	Go to church or read passages out of the Bible and they will tell you the same thing as me.

BvNemK5paa	Imagine a land where there are many people with vastly differing religious views (or none at all), and where they are told they can worship freely without anyone else's religion being forced on them by the State.... oh, wait, that's supposed to be US!!<br>  <br>  To insist that a man and a woman are the only ones who can be in a "marriage" because that's what God wants is ridiculous and is forcing religion on others.  TO make the correlation that if we allow gays to marry that will lead to inter-species marriage is ludicrous.<br>  <br>  Why ANYONE thinks that a civil right should be voted on/blocked is beyond me.  If that were the case, we'd still have slavery and segregation.<br>  <br>  Basically it boils down to this - if you don't like gay marriage, then don't be gay and want to get married.

And the Asians who can't afford it, use eye tape or glue (yes, they literally tape/glue their eyelids on). That aided by color contacts (at least 3/4 of young Japanese women all wear color contacts), makeup and false eyelashes proves that most Eastern Asians do have smaller eyes because there are so many popular products to make them bigger.

That's the best word to describe them.|`|qahczCNCaa	We have protuberant eyes...says that in wikipedia.

ORbFRn4oaa	As per the Quran there is "NO" punishment for ANYONE who leaves Islam i.e. becomes apostate.<br>  <br>  Ref.:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ag1L9pLRq6AJ3MF4Yqxd3Lrty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080602074008AAsP8Nr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  -------<br>  However, the present Sharia law is NOT according to the Quran.

Nobody has been executed in a Muslim country for converting out of Islam. A couple have been arrested in Iran, Afghanistan and Yemen, but there were also other issues involved with their arrests. In no constitution of ANY Muslim country it's permissible to kill a person for apostasy. I CHALLENGE PEOPLE TO PROVIDE A QUOTE. <br>  <br>  From a religious point of view: <br>  <br>  Apostasy is sinful, but it would only be punished in the hereafter. Muslims are not keepers over those who go astray to coerce them to accept Islam against their will. The duty of any Muslim is to convey the message and if somebody turns away, then the matter is between him and God. See also 3:20; 3:64; 3:144; 4:80; 5:92; 5:99; 5:105; 6:35; 6:66; 6:104; 6:107; 6:112; 6:149; 10:41; 10:99; 10:108; 24:54; 27:92; 30:52-53; 39:41; 50:45; 88:21-22; 109:6. There are other verses in the Quran which clearly envisage that an apostate is to be given an opportunity until his natural death to return to the fold of Islam, and if he doesn't his punishment is in the next life, not here: Quran 2:217: "…they will not cease fighting with you until they turn you back from your religion, if they can; and whoever of you turns back from his religion, then he dies while an unbeliever-- these it is whose works shall go for nothing in this world and the hereafter, and they are the inmates of the fire; therein they shall abide." The Arabic word that is used here is "fayamut" implies a person dying on his own and not being slain. Quran makes that clear distinction in verse 3:144 which uses two words "matta" (dies) and "qutila" (slain) together [both matta and fayamuth are derived from the same word 'moth' meaning death]. <br>  <br>  There are verses which say: <br>  <br>  [3.85] And whoever desires a religion other than Islam, it shall not be accepted from him, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers. <br>  [3.86] How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their believing and (after) they had borne witness that the Apostle was true and clear arguments had come to them; and Allah does not guide the unjust people. <br>  [3.87] (As for) these, their reward is that upon them is the curse of Allah and the angels and of men, all together. <br>  [3.88] Abiding in it; their chastisement shall not be lightened nor shall they be respited. <br>  [3.89] Except those who repent after that and amend, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. <br>  [3.90] Surely, those who disbelieve after their believing, then increase in unbelief, their repentance shall not be accepted, and these are they that go astray. <br>  [3.91] Surely, those who disbelieve and die while they are unbelievers, the earth full of gold shall not be accepted from one of them, though he should offer to ransom himself with it, these it is who shall have a painful chastisement, and they shall have no helpers. <br>  <br>  In these verses, Quran clearly offers repentance to apostates and in the absence of which, a painful punishment awaits them in the next world. No mention is made of punishment in this world. <br>  <br>  In Hadith literature, only those apostates are to be killed who are either waging a war against Muslims or who have joined the enemy camp. Bukhari has two chapters devoted to the issue of Apostasy. The first chapter is called “Kitab al-muaribin min ahl al-fufr wal’ridda (the book of those who fight (against the Muslims) from among the unbelievers and the apostates). The second chapter is called “kitaab istibat al-muanideen wal’murtadeen wa qital-i-him” (the book of calling to repentance to the enemies and the apostates and fighting with them.) It is obvious that both of these chapters refer to apostates who have become enemies of Muslims and the punishment for apostasy is not for simple conversion from faith. Those who quote the Hadith, “Whoever changes his religion, kill him,” forget that the same Hadith can apply to non-believers converting to Islam! <br>  <br>  There is not a single Hadith according to which Prophet Muhammad ordered the killing of a person just because he had converted out of Islam. In fact, there are two separates Ahadiths (plural of Hadith) in which two people converted out of Islam and they were not punished. One is the example of a person who had developed a flu after becoming a Muslim and thought that his sickness was due to his conversion (Bukhari 94:47). The other example is that of a scribe who converted to Christianity (Bukhari 61:25). <br>  <br>  The same is true about ‘fiqh’ where an apostate has to be ‘kafir-un harabiyy-un’ (unbeliever at war) to be executed. For reference see al-Marghinani’s al-Hidaya. Al Marghinani was the great Hanafi jurist, born in 1135 AD. His book has been recognized as the primary source for many ‘figh’ related issues where guidance cannot be found in either the Quran or the Hadith. Jurists who thought otherwise were merely relying on opinions and had little if anything from Quran and Hadith to support their point of view.|`|JCiGDSyBaa	NATASSAIA:<br>  <br>  If you read these HadIths in original Arabic, the two words used are, "Tarik lil-jama'ah" meaning a person who separates himself from the community and the other word is "al-mufariq" which means a person who is a renegade or a traitor. An apostate has to be a traitor or a person who has joined the enemy camp, during a war, to be killed. <br>  <br>  See also a very good book on this subject, "Punishment of Apostasy in Islam," written by S.A. Rahman, Pakistan's former Supreme Court judge.|`|AA12350023	I wonder how many peoples answers actually witnessed this and arent just answering out of hearsay from what they have read from biased news reports?<br>  I live in SaudiArabia and have never in my whole life seen or heard of anyone that has been executed for leaving Islam..

Among these gifts are prophecy, exhortation (kind of like encouragement), hospitality, healing, and teaching.... ie: one of roles pastors and preachers fulfill.<br>  <br>  While God has given all believers the Holy Spirit, believers are all still human.... with strengths, weaknesses, imperfections, etc. For a variety of reasons, God has set up the "church" for humanity. One of the purposes of the church is to help believers support, teach, and learn from one another.<br>  <br>  While I believe the Holy Spirit is in me, I also believe I am a sinful, imperfect human. There are things I am good at and understand, but there are also things I mess up. As great as the power of the Holy Spirit is, God has given us free-will and, as a result, sometimes my sinful nature takes over and I don't understand scripture or my sin gets in the way of my understanding. God has gifted teachers to help me understand.<br>  <br>  That said, teachers, preachers, pastors, etc. get things wrong, too. They aren't perfect, either. One would hope they have a gift for teaching so would be more accurate (the bible says God holds them to a higher standard because they are instructing others), but not one of us is perfect... that is why good pastors have others in their life who can help, teach, and support them, too.<br>  <br>  Christians and the church don't have things mastered. Christians are imperfect and the church is flawed. You bring up a very valuable point about denominations... in fact, the bible makes it clear that denominations were not God's design... but a result of sinful humans arguing and not agreeing.... not what God wanted.<br>  <br>  When Jesus returns he will perfect the church. Until then, we are flawed like everyone else.... doing the best we can to live as we know God desires. When Jesus returns I believe He will cast aside my sinful nature and the Holy Spirit will complete its perfect work in me... thus allowing me to understand scripture as God intends.<br>  <br>  You bring up a very valuable question. The reality is, though, if you want to, you will find flaws regarding how Christians live out their faith. The bible IS perfect and flawless, though.... Christians and the church are not (even with the Holy Spirit, our sinful spirit gets in the way of perfect understanding).<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and God bless in your own quest for truth and understanding. Though I, the life I lead, the Christians I know, and the church I attend are imperfect and flawed.... my God is good and HE is perfect. I pray that you find what you are looking for. You are asking a thoughtful and deep question... which, to me, says you are looking for something. = )|`|AA10034051	Is private interpretation of the Bible condoned in the Bible Itself?  No, it is not (2 Peter 1:20).  Was individual interpretation of Scripture practiced by the early Christians or the Jews?  Again, "NO" (Acts 8:29-35).  The assertion that individuals can correctly interpret Scripture is false.  Even the "founder" of Sola Scriptura (Martin Luther), near the end of his life, was afraid that "any milkmaid who could read" would found a new Christian denomination based on his or her "interpretation" of the Bible.  Luther opened a "Pandora's Box" when he insisted that the Bible could be interpreted by individuals and that It is the sole authority of Christianity.  Why do we have over 38,000 different non-Catholic Christian denominations?  The reason is individuals' "different" interpretations of the Bible.<br>  Can there be more than one interpretation of the Bible?  No.  The word "truth" is used several times in the New Testament.  However, the plural version of the word "truth" never appears in Scripture.  Therefore, there can only be one Truth.  So how can there be over 38,000 non-Catholic Christian denominations all claiming to have the "Truth" (i.e., the correct interpretation of the Bible)?  For that matter, aren't ALL non-Catholic Christians as individuals claiming "infallibility" when it comes to interpreting the Bible?  Catholics only believe in the infallibility of the Papacy as an office.  Which is more believable - one office holding infallibility or 400 million non-Catholic Christians who can't agree on the interpretation of Scripture all claiming "infallibility?"  When it comes to interpreting Scripture, individual non-Catholic Christians claim the same infallibility as the Papacy.  If one were to put two persons of the "same" non-Catholic Christian denomination (i.e., two Presybterians, two Lutherans, two Baptists, etc.) in separate rooms with a Bible and a notepad and ask them to write down their "interpretation" of the Bible, passage for passage, shouldn't they then produce the exact same interpretation?  If guided by the Holy Spirit as Scripture states, the answer should be "Yes."  But would that really happen?  History has shown that the answer is "No."  Now, in the case of Catholics, the Church which Christ founded and is with forever (Matthew 28:20) interprets the Bible, as guided by the Holy Spirit, (Mark 13:11) for the "sheep" (the faithful).  The Church (not individuals) interpret Scripture.  In Catholicism, Scripture is there for meditation, prayer and inspiration, not for individual interpretation to formulate doctrine or dogma.|`|8cmeDY2baa	The underlining truth you may be seeking is: "Is there a Holy Spirit?"<br>  <br>  No. There is no Spaghetti Monster, "spiritual" God, heaven, hell, afterlife, reincarnation, rapture or resurrection either.

You ask about understanding, and then jump to different denominations.  Most of the protestant denominations, which is what you are talking about, are very similar.  The differences are in small items like worship style and such, where they mostly agree on all the important parts.  Also, preachers are professionals, and go to school in order to know more about the context and times the Bible was written in.  They know more about the history than the average christian.  But, even if you need to be a christian in order to understand any of the bible, it doesn't mean that you know all of it because you are a christian.  What it means, and what you are saying is that if you are not a christian, you can't understand any of the scriptures.  <br>  <br>  Then you ask about other religions, which have nothing to do with the bible.  If you keep changing the subject, how can anyone ever answer you?  Your question is a moving target.  I can tell that your real goal is to get christians to doubt their beliefs, but you actually end up making our faith and knowledge stronger.  I know that wasn't your goal, but that's the result of your efforts.|`|h07uBpjNaa	I would say that the Holy Spirit is required for one to have more than a basic, superficial level of understanding of the Bible. At its heart, the Bible has a simple message throughout. That message is that people need salvation and God provides it. You don't need the Holy Spirit to see that in the Bible. There are other similar lessons that are obvious from the text.<br>  <br>  The Bible tells us that people are gifted in different ways. Not everyone is called to be a pastor. Not everyone is called to teach. The Bible says that many different gifts brought by many different people make up the body of the church. We strengthen and uphold one another.<br>  <br>  The model from the very beginning--first century--has been that there are pastors teaching from God's word. It is also clear that such teaching has always been done in the open, with one man's interpretation being verified by others. 10,000 preachers armed with only their own understanding would probably form 20,000 denominations. The reality is that we are to "stand on the shoulders" of those who have gone before. We compare our interpretation with that of scholars and theologians who have gone before us. If we disagree, we'd better figure out why before we go off and start a new church.<br>  <br>  You see much division in the church today because many have eschewed the hard work of theology for the easy path of relativism. This is typified by statements such as, "What it means to *me* is more important than the truth!"<br>  <br>  There is also division in the church because some areas are not clearly spelled out. Some things are black and white. To disagree on these things is heresy. Other things are just not all that clear. To disagree on these things is okay just as long as we don't allow them to break our fellowship. Unfortunately, many have stood on these gray areas and divided our church.<br>  <br>  Christians are no better than anyone else. They screw up all the time. They don't listen to the Holy Spirit like they should.|`|EczLqAIKaa	I do rely on my own interpretation, but it doesn't hurt to get a second opinion.|`|QoTfQfRFaa	sounds to me like you have already answered this for yourself.<br>  <br>  But i'll give my thoughts....<br>  <br>  The Holy Spirit is the gift from God and the evidence is speaking in tongues. Since God is the author of his bible it is the spirit of God that will guide you in the truth of his word. <br>       The reason there are many denominations is because people don't love the truth. Jesus told us in his parable of the talents( Mat 25:14). 3 men were given talents 2 made a profit and the 3rd man buried his. When the master came he said to the 3rd man.."I will take what you have and give to another" What this means is that when the Lord gives you a piece of truth and you do nothing with it you will lose what you have and it will go to another. So when a man gets a part of truth and rejects that truth because is it too uncomfortable then he loses what he has  and the Lord will try with another person.<br>  <br>       Another reason is that people are to lazy, lovers of pleasure the lovers of God. 2Ti 3:4<br>  <br>  ---- Knowledge comes before understanding, then comes wisdom ----|`|6jAVElX7aa	the Bible also says not to forget to assemble together to hear the Word of God. Some churches have departed from the word of God through false preachers. Therefore the Holy Spirit also departs from that church, and the church is really a cold place to be. Unless the preacher sticks to  what is written in the Bible, the Work of the Holy Spirit can be hindered.|`|KILFoc6kaa	I certainly don't rely on our churches pastor, or the elders to interpret the bible for me.

The texts are of great religious and historical significance, as they include some of the only known surviving copies of Biblical documents made before 100 C.E., and preserve evidence of considerable diversity of belief and practice within late Second Temple Judaism. They are written in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, mostly on parchment, but with some written on papyrus. [1] These manuscripts generally date between 150 B.C.E. to 70 C.E.[2]. The scrolls are most commonly identified with the ancient Jewish sect called the Essenes, but recent scholarship has challenged their association with the scrolls.<br>  <br>  The Dead Sea Scrolls are traditionally divided into three groups: "Biblical" manuscripts (copies of texts from the Hebrew Bible), which comprise roughly 40% of the identified scrolls; "Apocryphal" or "Pseudepigraphical" manuscripts (known documents from the Second Temple Period like Enoch, Jubilees, Tobit, Sirach, non-canonical psalms, etc., that were not ultimately canonized in the Hebrew Bible), which comprise roughly 30% of the identified scrolls; and "Sectarian" manuscripts (previously unknown documents that speak to the rules and beliefs of a particular group or groups within greater Judaism) like the Community Rule, War Scroll, Pesher (Hebrew pesher ??? = "Commentary") on Habakkuk, and the Rule of the Blessing, which comprise roughly 30% of the identified scrolls.[3]<br>  <br>  Publication of the scrolls has taken many decades, and the delay has been a source of academic controversy. As of 2007 two volumes remain to be completed, with the whole series, Discoveries in the Judean Desert, running to thirty-nine volumes in total. Many of the scrolls are now housed in the Shrine of the Book in Jerusalem. According to The Oxford Companion to Archeology, "The biblical manuscripts from Qumran, which include at least fragments from every book of the Old Testament, except perhaps for the Book of Esther, provide a far older cross section of scriptural tradition than that available to scholars before. While some of the Qumran biblical manuscripts are nearly identical to the Masoretic, or traditional, Hebrew text of the Old Testament, some manuscripts of the books of Exodus and Samuel found in Cave Four exhibit dramatic differences in both language and content. In their astonishing range of textual variants, the Qumran biblical discoveries have prompted scholars to reconsider the once-accepted theories of the development of the modern biblical text from only three manuscript families: of the Masoretic text, of the Hebrew original of the Septuagint, and of the Samaritan Pentateuch. It is now becoming increasingly clear that the Old Testament scripture was extremely fluid until its canonization around 100 A.D."|`|VRl1jENHaa	The Dead Sea Scrolls contain two types of books:  copies of the books found in the Hebrew Bible, and copies of manuscripts considered to be Scripture by the Essenes (a Jewish sect that practiced EXTREME asceticism).

It's hard to say if she took care of the cat or not, but in any case you want a housemate who likes and cares about your pet. Addtionally, you're reason for having a housemate is not being met here. You didn't want a renter, you wanted a roomy. You should tell this person that aside from the cat situation, you really wanted a roomate for company, and it isn't working out. Perhaps she'll be willing to work things out; or there may be hard feelings, but you'll be able to move on to better circumstances.

oiNkygNtaa	short-term effects:<br>  The effects of LSD are unpredictable.They depend on the amount taken, the user's personality, mood, and expectations, and the surroundings in which the drug is used.The physical effects include dilated pupils, higher body temperature, increased heart rate and blood pressure, sweating, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, dry mouth, and tremors. Sensations and feelings change much more dramatically than the physical signs.The user may feel several different emotions at once or swing rapidly from one emotion to another.If taken in a large enough dose, the drug produces delusions and visual hallucinations.The user's sense of time and self changes.Sensations may seem to "cross over," giving the user the feeling of hearing colors and seeing sounds. <br>  <br>  long-term effects: <br>  Some LSD users experience flashbacks, recurrence of certain aspects of a person's experience without the user having taken the drug again.A flashback occurs suddenly, often without warning, and may occur within a few days or more than a year after LSD use.Most users of LSD voluntarily decrease or stop its use over time. LSD is not considered to be an addicting drug because it does not produce compulsive drug-seeking behavior like cocaine, amphetamines, heroin, alcohol, or nicotine. <br>  <br>  another words it's pretty good $hit, can i have some to please :)|`|g2JlIuRcaa	you turn into a blithering dumbass named ozzy ozbourne, Your wife is an annoying ***** your kids are brats on drugs and you poop your pants.
AA11403222	I'm afraid the Greeks made that one up all by themselves.  No parallels with any other countries mythology that I know of.  Sorry.  The original Athena is believed to the the Aegean Goddess worshiped in Crete and Minos, two places that the warlike Greeks conquered when they came to power.  It is believed they took Athena and made her one of their own, but demoted her from Supreme Mother Goddess, to a warrior goddess born from the head of their supreme male god.|`|NR3YnkVPaa	We have a myth in my family that my sister burst out of the head of Big Foot.

IBvc74Mlaa	The Roman mythology might have similar legend, but each culture is extremely different.|`|2JOTC78Faa	"F. M. Muller sought an explanation of Athena's birth in the<br>  circumstances attending the daily birth of the sun, identifying Athena with the Vedic goddess Ahana (the Dawn): That Athena or Athana was originally a representative of the light of the morning, then of light and wisdom in general, born from the head of Dyaus [the<br>  sky], and that her name is the same as the Vedic Ahana, is as certain as anything can be in comparative mythology."<br>  <br>  <br>  *In Greek mythology (same country as Athena), Pegasus, the magical winged horse was supposedly born from the blood or from the neck of his mother, Medusa, as she was beheaded. Chrysaor, his brother, sprung forth from her neck at the same time, as Perseus chopped it off with an axe.<br>  <br>  Minerva was the Roman version, the parallel of Athena, if that's what you're asking.

r9s0VyJgaa	Get away from your family, they are horrible people to treat you the way they do -- especially your mother and sister. <br>  <br>  Go back to Australia and study accounting if that's what you want to do.  Your mother has no idea what she's talking about when she says that you won't be able to get a job in accounting at the age of 26.  Of course you will!!  26 years old is not old, and if you do well in school and get good grades in your accounting courses you will be competitive in the job market.<br>  <br>  Your first responsibility is to yourself and YOUR future, not to accompanying your mother to dine out in restaurants.  Why doesn't your mother dine out with your father??  Your mother is a controlling b*tch.  You don't have to put your part-time job in jeopardy just to take her out to dinner, that's ridiculous. <br>  <br>  Dj'ing is a good part-time job.  Don't listen to your mother, you are NOT stupid -- SHE is.  <br>  <br>  Yes it sounds to me like you are suffering from depression.  <br>  <br>  Get out of your family's house, go far away from them, and don't see them anymore unless you have to, maybe once a year for Christmas.  Live your own life and be happy.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Right now, your family is not helping you at all. They are basically feeding you emotional poison. And you don't need that. Even though you know the things they are saying are wrong, if you listen to them enough, it will mess with your mind. You should leave there now... where you go is up to you. Just get out of there. And for the future, let them know that if they want to have any type of contact with you, they have to treat you with respect, the way you treat them. If they can't do that, you're better off without them.<br>  <br>  You don't have to accept unacceptable behavior.|`|bbWzitisaa	1) i think you should go back to australia and study what you really want to do. as for me, i am into science, so that is what i am currently studying. don't let them get to you. you don't have to stay there. i would suggest going back to get away from such a depressing lifestyle.<br>  <br>  2) i think your parents and sister are wrong for treating you like that. i wouldn't blame you if you wanted to cut contact with them. but still, it is not good to have to live through such abuse. they can't change you.<br>  <br>  3) i think if you really want to dj, go for it. it could be something fun and new. obviously she does not think things through. it is not a career you want, it is something that you want to do as a hobby. there is nothing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  4) i could see why, she is trying to control every aspect of your life. which is wrong. you are old enough to make your own decisions. she really does not understand...you don't choose to be gay, and she could never "turn" you straight.<br>  <br>  5) i would say that you are depressed. try to get out, move out on your own, or with a friend who cares about you. you don't have to live like that. i also suffer from insomnia issues, but for other reasons. if you can't sleep, don't force yourself. try to read something until you find it difficult to stay awake, then try to go to sleep. this is just not a good environment for you.<br>  <br>  6) i would say go back to australia. they are not listening to you, just making things harder on you. i hope things go well, and i wish you the best of luck with your decision. if it were me, i would go back to australia.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	i am bi, it is wrong for your family to call you bad names. Please speak to a counselor or therapist to get emotional support. It is hard to read your story it is complicated, Do what makes YOU happy,but of course have some consideration of others. i feel a lot of sympathy for you having a similiar situation.if you live Australia be there, talk to a counselor on how to deal with your family with your gay issues.|`|rNXCnJ8Eaa	Oh my God I'm so sorry you're in a situation like this. You definitely need to get out of that house. And pardon my language, but tell your sister to go f*ck herself.

Wash that little brat's mouth with soap then say "Pretty aggressive for a girly man huh?"|`|SrV4XYmraa	Get out of there. They just want to make your life miserable.

They wont care if your 26, they dont want to hire very young people anyway. <br>  <br>  two) They are bitches and they put you down all the time. you are better off without them<br>  <br>  three)If you like<br>  <br>  four)She dosn't cherish the son-mother relationship she has made that clear. Why should you?<br>  <br>  five)Most likely<br>  <br>  six) Dont live with them. Some people, even family, arnt good to be around. You will end up failing at anything because you will be depressed. Get away from the as quickly as possible. Maybe they will realise what you mean to them if you just leave... they are pretty bitchy. If it was me, i would NEVER speak to them again and would most likely leave without saying anyhting, or spit at someone. but thats just me|`|nXIm9Oqvaa	You really need to do what you want...Your family will regret treating you badly, I'm sure. I don't think you should listen to them if they're gonna treat you like that, anyway. They're criticizing you for being who you are, and they're trying to tell you what to do. Don't let that happen...or you won't be happy. <br>  I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. :[<br>  Good luck..<br>  <br>  EDIT: I'm sorry to tell you this, but your mom is a *****. Leave.

ItRr3x51aa	That's pretty cool, actually, and i think it might just be a coincidence. Usually, dreams are your brain tring to sort out the day's events. So, subconsciously, you got close to figuring it out, but the next day, your brain had that in that back of the mind, and whn you saw it (whatever it was), you realized that you could use it to get a perfect score.

But I am only one person. It's that couple's business and not ours to determine the lameness of their relationship.|`|C9QQPROkaa	No its not lame and if they looked uncomfortable its probably because they know they were being watched like hawks i.e. you and your gf for one even if you didn't have a problem with it im sure you weren't the only ones watching.

I personally LOVE all the attention we get...mainly because it makes our union that much more stronger and passionate. <br>  <br>  Thanks Haters.|`|KpqhVvtaaa	how could you tell they weren't a good match?  did you talk to them?  it could've been their first date, most couples are awkward and uncomfortable on a first date it has nothing to do with race...  you and your girlfriend seem lame.|`|d3A83djHaa	I think that is a personal choice, and has nothing to do with you or your girlfriend.  And no, I don't think it's lame.  It's just two people who love each other.|`|8iJe2S2Daa	Wait... you were out on a date and you noticed another couple and spent your time talking about it to the point that you had to come to a place like this and ask.........

The false separator of race means nothing.  The most important differences are your blood types.  When you are laying dieing for blood do you think I only want blood from my race?  Or do you say I hope someone has by blood type that I need?  The right blood type from a different race will save you when the wrong blood type from one of your race could be fatal.<br>  <br>  And yes I have dated outside my race and while none of them ended marrying me it was more enjoyable, than my marriages were.  <br>  <br>  So thank you for the Idea,  I will go looking for some spice in my life now.  Single and dating !|`|NmsBFeNJaa	Maybe they looked awkward and uncomfortable because you and your girlfriend were rudely staring at them and gossiping about them.

When others show they have a different conviction of the issue, there is a natural urge to correct and convince them. The strength of the urge corresponds to the importance of the issue. The receivers of the correction have the same urge to oppose and reject the modification.<br>  <br>  The result of this impulse and opposition is called the “Cassandra Syndrome”. Mythical Cassandra was given the gift of prophecy and later cursed such that no one believed her.

Av8ccoYQaa	Wow, what's with the hostility toward Muslims? Why was Columbus able to make a voyage that Arabs and Africans couldn't? Does being European somehow give him capabilities the Arabs and Africans don't have?<br>  <br>  My my, some people sure showed their ill sides in answers here. Maybe some of you can redeem yourselves now by doing more research on this yourselves. What does Columbus' journal say? There were Muslims and black people in the New World? Something like that, is what I've read in different places.<br>  <br>  This is from wikipedia, but I have seen this information before about the fleet of Mali ships:<br>  <br>  "Arabic sources describe what some consider to be visits to the New World by a Mali fleet in 1311.[23] According to these sources, 400 ships from the Mali Empire discovered a land across the ocean to the West after being swept off course by ocean currents. Only one ship returned, and the captain reported the discovery of a western current to Prince Abubakari II; the off-course Mali fleet of 400 ships is said to have conducted both trade and warfare with the peoples of the western lands. Prince Abubakari II then abdicated his throne and set off to explore these western lands. In 1324, the Mali king Mansa Musa is said to have told the Arabic historian, Al-Umari that "his predecessors had launched two expeditions from West Africa to discover the limits of the Atlantic Ocean."<br>  <br>  The quickest route is the mid-trans-Atlantic ocean current, it's a natural shipping lane between the top of Africa and Central America. With Allah's blessing of good winds, it's a relatively quick trip.<br>  <br>  Some evidence suggest West Africans made the trip across the water long before 1311 (see the wiki article and other research available on internet).<br>  <br>  What I don't understand is why many claims with evidence of such trans-Atlantic crossing from Africa are discounted out right. It's a natural shipping land, the same one Columbus used, so why is it hard to believe Africans or Muslims could not make such crossing?<br>  <br>  I also read once, and sorry I don't have a citation, but someone who really wants to know the truth on this can do the research, that Columbus made a remark in his journal that the first peoples he came across in "the New Word" appeared to be "Mohammadeans."<br>  <br>  My hypothesis is also that the Toltec Indian (Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico) legend of the bearded white holy man who came to them across the ocean and who is associated with an actual ruler of the Toltecs around 900 A.D. was Hidden Imam.<br>  <br>  It is possible that both Sunni and Shia Islam had come to America before Columbus.<br>  <br>  I saw a documentary a few years ago on Columbus that suggested he used the natural shipping lane of the mid-trans-Atlantic Ocean current (which would also explain why he landed where he did across the water). The documentary also suggested that Columbus had learned of this route from Muslim sailors. At the time I saw that, I didn't know much about Islam or the Sunni/Shia split or Hidden Imam possibly being connected to the Toltec legend, but it's only the hypothesis that Shia Islam had spread across Mexico that makes any sense to me why Sunni Muslims would have informed Catholics about the shipping lane instead of themselves rushing over to colonize and claim "the New World" for themselves.<br>  <br>  This is a great topic to follow up and explore more; happy researching!|`|DMkk2yuLaa	Finally someone who speaks the truth! I mean your logic is flawless, 7th century religion was able to spread to america before the mayans who have been dated to be in the americas starting around 2600 BC.

Now, I notice you are sometimes full of misinformation. Arabs were the first to come to America?  No they werent.  Scientists have determined that  Eric The Red (A viking from Greenland) was here first.  There is also evidence that the early Chinese were here . And the Native Americans were certainly here.  There is no need to report you, just as there is no need for you to pretend that you are better than non-muslims.  Dont deny it, you practically reek of it in most of your questions.  It is good for you to be Muslim, I'm for it for you.  But you are not better than other people, so try to be considerate when you post questions.  Nobody respects you when you imply insults.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	No no no ! My ancestors have been here in the western hemisphere for 100,000 yrs. We were here with the Ice age, we hunted mammoths.

It's in yours, mine, and everyone else's.  The concept is called "free will."  It was granted to us.  <br>  <br>  Second, you don't need to have a star fall on your head to know that it's a ball of hot gases.  And, you most likely have not been in the first person position to experience the miracle of birth, but you are aware of it.  You can not see the wind, but you know it's there.  You have tasted salt, but can you actually describe it (in words only) to someone who has never tasted salt?  Can you describe the color blue to someone who has been blind since birth?  And can you actually come up with one decent answer as to why God should physically manifest Himself to just you?<br>  <br>  You do have a choice of not sinning, i.e., doing something "bad."  In just about every "holy" book (The Bible, the Torah, the Koran, etc.) there is at least ONE general rule:  "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you."  Then there is: "Don't steal and Don't murder."  There are several more "good rules for living" out there.<br>  <br>  I can not say that your "hurting" God, but I am pretty certain you may be disappointing God.  Consider your current situation.  You could be somewhere else in the world wondering where your next meal is coming from, or whether or not some idiot will blow himself (or herself) up next to you as you're walking down the street, or you could be in a country where you would not be allowed to own a cell phone or a computer...or you  (or your parents) could mysteriously "disappear" in the middle of the night because you (or they) said something that was detrimental to the current person in power.  Kinda "miraculous" that you have the things that you do have, now isn't it?<br>  <br>  Besides, wouldn't it be better to believe in God and find out He doesn't exist, than to NOT believe in Him and find out he does?<br>  <br>  It's called "faith," Abby.  Sometimes it's learned, sometimes it's acquired over a long period of time, and sometimes it's "forced" upon you when you least expect it.  Try to look around you where you live.  Look with open, objective eyes, and SEE rather than just "look."    Read The Bible...just for kicks.  Take a walk in the woods, if you have any nearby...and listen.  Don't just "hear" the sounds...LISTEN.<br>  <br>  And...you don't need to like sports.<br>  <br>  I'm secure in my beliefs and they hurt no one.<br>  <br>  Besides, God loves you...unconditionally...no matter what.<br>  <br>  Peace, sweetie.|`|33ThRhRhaa	If you know you're sinning, you understand you're breaking God's law and what His standards for your life are, so essentially YOU DO believe in Him. You are just openly rebelling and refusing to acknowledge Him as your Lord and Savior. And you are hurting yourself, one way or another - it may not be today, it may not be tonight, it may not be tomorrow, or a week or a year from now, but one day, you will be in utter regret and there will be nothing anyone can do for you, not even yourself because you deny God, whom you have admitted you know is there but do not want to follow.

XuhQS9wsaa	Yea you are. And your at the age where it is most confusing. Thats the same way I felt at your age. I am now 20 and am gay. I came out a year ago as bi and then quickly realized that once I was somewhat out, my feelings for girls just went away completely. But I have never been happier or had so much fun! Its possible you could continue to have feelings for both sexes or maybe one day you will realize your just not into females... or just not into males. Either way, stay open to everything! I love all the young people being so open to the idea of being gay. Its only getting better and better for us :)|`|8t24Xmm9aa	There is a likelyhood that sexual-orientation is a mostly social construct.  <br>  Humans develop attraction to things by a process of association, similar to the way children develop favorite foods.  The food is retrospectively labeled according to previous experiences with the food.

Because it is socially acceptable.  The reason you can't have a "white pride" parade is because those have been reversed by the retards in society like the KKK and the Arian Brotherhood, which hates everyone except white hicks. which means a white pride parade is instantly associated with racism or racists or people up to no good. that is why it its looked down upon. <br>  <br>  Your basic answer is because that is what our society has created as a bar of standards and you have to change the bar in order to change the standards.|`|b5TGnDPOaa	Why is the sky blue?

The problem is, White people in countries like the US and UK cannot UNITE. I mean seriously, if a Hispanic ran for presidency, all 15 percent of the Latinos in this nation would vote for him. See how Obama got so many Black votes?<br>  <br>  Now White people cannot unite at all. You have White people down South who are proud of being the race they are and thats okay but then you have White people out in California bashing them for it. It truly is sad, you guys need to be joined like all other races too, get rid of the hippies out in Cali, tell them to smoke pot for eternity instead of 12 out of the 24 hours per day.<br>  <br>  SEE that is what makes someone unique, when you do stuff individually instead of relying on race for everything it makes you a better human being.

You can have all the groups you want, and you can call yourself a European-American. <br>  As for whether blacks and whites have been equal for a few decades, you might be interested to know that less than 5 decades ago, National Guardsmen in Orangeburg, SC, shot some college students who wanted to bowl at the All-Star Lanes.<br>  You are a narrow-minded little idiot with no sense of what the cafeteria ladies at your school have been thru, but I'm willing to bet that if you ask them to let you come to their association meeting, they will welcome you.|`|57oHulIDaa	1. "blacks and whites are equal...they've been equal for a few decades"<br>  actually blacks and whites have always  been equal since blacks and whites have always been humans. we might not have been treated as equals, but we've always been equal. <br>  2. there is no group that can exclude based on race in the united states. there is no group that a black person has that a white person, or a person of any color, can not join strictly because of what race they are.<br>  3. you don't have to call blacks african-american, i don't even call blacks african-american, and i'm black.<br>  4. you can call yourself a european-american, there is no law that says you can't.<br>  sorry the answer is so long...there's just a lot of things that needed to be addressed. :)|`|Ps9eOIchaa	Black people do it to celebrate the accomplishments of the black race that was belittled by white people.And usually when white people form groups like those,it is linked to feeling racially superior and trying to make other races feel inferior.<br>  And another thing,unless you are of direct European descent,i don't think Europeans want you to be referred to that.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	Because in white majority countries be it the USA or the UK, the white majority doesn't get rights that foreigners and minorities get.

If I join a golf club it will be majority white, if a join a baseball team majority, every club by default is majority white.<br>  <br>  So why do I ask a black always have to feel like I stand out being a minority,you do not understand how uncomfortable it feels to always be the only one of your race in everything you do.  If you lived in a country that was 90% black and 10% white like south africa then you would understand.  There white people form special interest groups that are mostly white.  I wouldn't say its racist because its not against black people its just no one feels like being a minority 24/7.<br>  <br>  You can call yourself whatever you want.  We African Americans come from africa our ancestors were kidnapped put in chains and robbed of everything they had, language, religion, culture, robbed of the name their mama ggave them. Stripped naked and mutilated and then beaten like dogs, more black people died on the atalantic ocean than jews died in concentration camps and called ******* a name we did not give to ourselves our accept.  <br>  <br>  So why should we call our selves a name that was given to us under a racist pretext and has no basis.  Our skin is brown not black, so that doesn't even make sense.  It was only given to us to degrade us and make us look bad.  Its like asking a jew why he doesn't call himself a kike, its is an extremely offensive and racist term given to them by someone else.  They don't come from kikeland, we don't come from nigerland or negorland or colorland or blackland, we come from africa.<br>  <br>  Its not a matter of political correct its a matter of people being able to establish their own identities.  When you are saying that one can't be african american, its like saying to that person their African ancestry is irrelevant it doesn't matter and you should be put in chains again.

Believing in religion or the bible will very much keep you close minded to many other things besides religion.  To me that is not what a religion should do.  There are many happy folks who are religious and live very good lives but they had to give their individuality in trade for their beliefs  They  have lost the the ability to think for themselves as now they can only answer things according to their religious beliefs.

I also think they've been misconstrued to be a way to judge others, which has nothing at all to do with a spiritual path. The idea is to look inward and seek the changes for oneself to progress, and instead it's turned outward toward those who don't fit the ideals. I find this sad, since it's done more to hurt the human race than help.<br>  <br>  Looking at it this way: if those who choose to follow religion all used it as a guide for themselves, I think the overall objectivity of the world would increase as the masses changed themselves individually.

Mm k, about the whole "putting people into one group by race" thing, well I don't think its right & I'm sure many others don't as well, but its something that obviously has been around for a long time & will be hard to get rid of because people are entitled to their opinions.<br>  <br>  As for the other question you've asked: "Why do some white people act black?" Well as you've said "I am not racist in the slightest & do not condone racism"...but you just contradicted yourself in a way. Your question reflects the main reason why people put labels on everything today. Thats like saying ALL black people listen to rap music, eat chicken, & talk slang. Which of course, is not true. Lots of people say that I'm not a black girl just because I'm different. However, I totally see that many black people in the world today choose to put labels on themselves which doesn't make the situation any better. I am not only black american, I am also a mix of other races. I hate to hear someone ask me "Why do you act white?" & my answer to that of course, is "I don't act like anything I just am what I am, Why do you ask such stupid questions?"...<br>  <br>  But in most cases, the way a person acts depends on where they come from.

I always told my children that they couldn't spit on the sidewalk without me hearing about it by the time they got home.  My youngest daughter has chosen to raise her three children here for the same reasons.

As for your problem i had the exact same problem with someone i liked but now i'm dating him he is my fiance to be and i love him we liked each other for 3 years and we knew we liked each other but every time we would kick around getting together something would come up and we would find ourselves in another relationship that we couldn't get out of at the moment so we would go our separate ways. But we finaly got together and are very happy. The advice i can give you is dont give up and talk to him about it. If you two are meant to love eachother nothing can stand in your way. Love always finds a way i believe in soul mates exhisting in this world it would be a very sad place if we didnt have the hope we have for intimate relationships and finding someone you can love for the rest of your life|`|zEoRcL91aa	Are you quiet young? Get to know him as much as you can and be direct and honest about your feelings, but using humour.Don't be one of those vampire girls, who cling as soon as a guy shows interest.<br>  <br>   I get the feeling that you aren't confident with direct confrontation.<br>  This will lead to problems later. Most mature men like a woman, who are honest and open, but at the same time, remaining a little mysterious. The fine line between openess and mysteriousness takes time to develop.
OSnmnuQPaa	Okay, First of all you can't even spell the word *GHOST* right lol..<br>  <br>  Second : I know a few who do believe in ghosts, But I do not. Personally I think Ghosts are just passed down legends made up by previous generations (now long dead!) to explain the unknown optical illusions and tricks of the eye and the mind. The rumours spread like wildfires and so did the alleged ghosts! But then again.. You never know what is true because *for example*, Scientists are discovering new things they never thought possible on a daily basis! Who knows.. They might even find evidence of paranormal activity one day :P ;)|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Ghost. Ghost. I have never seen a goast, or a ghost.

It's also becoming increasingly more important to know, although that does depend on the field you want to go into.

OXuhjS0jaa	I'm sorry to hear of your dissatisfaction.  Depending upon your age, I would suggest to you to seek out some other church where your spiritual needs will be more "satisfied."  Worship is a very personal thing, and it is one reason why there are so many different denominations and "forms" of worship service.  What your parents feel "fulfilled" with may not meet your needs.  Please search out other congregations... the Holy Spirit will help you find where you belong.<br>  <br>  <br>  Forgive others as I have forgiven you.|`|tManvxfQaa	Go and read the Bible for yourself and pray and have a one on one relationship with God......then you will be more attentive to whats going on around you.........every ones mind wanders from the Truth....the enemy will try to fill your mind with all sorts of things to distract you......that's why its important You get alone with God and study and pray for yourself....that's where the Living for God comes in at anyway...NOT in going to a church building..........<br>  <br>  YOU are the temple of God in where He is to dwell....but He will Not dwell in an unclean temple......|`|X9rXRNUxaa	THE PATH TO LIFE<br>  <br>  Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fullness of joy; [Psalm 16:11]<br>  <br>  In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.

[Romans 6:23]<br>  <br>  Jesus Shared with us in Life and Death<br>  <br>  But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. [Hebrews 2:9]<br>  Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;  And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage [Hebrews 2:14-15]<br>  <br>  POWERFUL LIFE<br>  <br>  Jesus Rose From The Dead<br>  <br>  Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.

And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:  :5  And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?  He is not here, but is risen: [Luke 24:1-6]<br>  <br>  The Apostle Paul wrote of Jesus Christ<br>  <br>  And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead: [Romans 1:4]<br>  <br>  RESURRECTION LIFE<br>  <br>  Death is not the end.<br>  <br>  “Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.

For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.  So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

According to the scriptures, the bible is very confusing to non saved people.  Mainly so that only people that understand get the privilege to understand what God is saying.  You could either get saved, or if so already.  You must pray about it.  Not just a little 5 minute prayer either.  Truly pray, repent to him and thank him for everything he has done for you.  Just surrender your heart to him and let him know all of your problems.  Give him all your problems to hold onto and take care of.  This is bound to let God truly work with you.|`|AA11008046	Prepare yourself for the service by spending time in prayer prior to the start of the service.  Don't go to church with hurts on your mind.  Don't go into service without prayer time first if you just had a fight with your spouse.

There are a lot of good books about growing spiritually and faith formation.  Also, try practising meditative prayer so you can be taught by God directly in the form of personal revelation.  Keep the faith burning.|`|LdExmo6taa	That is an easy question to answer. Just find a quiet  place to be alone and start talking to God like you would your best friend. He hears everything, and understands the desires of your heart. You might have to do it several times before He will begin speaking to your heart, but it will happen. You probably won't hear Him with your ears, but you will know when He begins to speak to you. Just have a conversation with Him.<br>  <br>  What you need is a relationship with Him, not religion.

And PRAY to god.|`|KPNOQAP4aa	concentrate on one or two points of the sermon and try to find all the verses you know that correlate with the subject<br>  <br>  or, [this is what i do] find an idea in the sermon that catches your attention and write poetry based on it! it's a unique way to praise God and it stretches your creative side.<br>  <br>  there are other times that i will bring a sketch book and draw what the sermon is making me picture in my mind.<br>  <br>  you can also try taking notes, but if your pastor is hard to follow [mine is famous for his bunny trails] this can be difficult.<br>  <br>  sometimes the best thing to do is close your eyes. this will put your total focus on listening instead of looking around and getting distracted. but don't try this if you're sleepy! :D<br>  <br>  i make an effort to find two to five things each week that i can relate to. then the whole next week as part of my devos i will do further soul-searching on those things.<br>  <br>  keep praying that God will draw you close to him! i always have to MAKE myself pay attention because it's really hard for me to sit still, so i know how frustrating it can be. giving your problem to your Father is always a foolproof step towards growing closer to Him.|`|rU6nh42Eaa	Work on a closer relationship with God.  That's the important part.  Just be personal and casual with him, "like he's there with you" -- you know what I mean.  I found out that when I really knew God, all of a sudden the church stuff made way more sense.  I really enjoyed getting into the Bible.  And if all else fails, and the sermon really is boring, read the Bible or the hymn book...|`|fNw4wJSGaa	Your not chained to that one church are you?<br>  <br>  Find a church that interests you, or do some studying on your own.<br>  <br>  I know my parents, when I was little, felt the same way and started a Bible study group, where they could discuss how the scriptures made them feel and such.<br>  <br>  Of course they later became atheists, but that doesn't mean that others will follow the same path. That's what just the conclusions they came too.|`|fjWSayzuaa	definitely pray, ask God to make His Word clear to you.  Also talk to others (i.e. your parents, pastor, etc.), you may also want to try getting a study Bible that you can understand and use it.<br>  <br>  try getting involved in ministry at your church as well as school (if you're school age). such as Fellowship of Christian Athletes, See You at the Pole or Students Standing Strong, etc.<br>  <br>  Keep seeking, God hears and answers prayer!|`|e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	Here are some techniques that work in my life:<br>  <br>  Try coming up with QUESTIONS and then ask your minister to prove what the Bible says.  If he can't then investigate for yourself.  It will make you listen closer when he speaks to see if what he says coincides with what you learned in your studies.<br>  <br>  I also find TAKING NOTES helps my concentration since I am learning "auditorially" (hearing) and "visually" (seeing my notes) and you have to concentrate to know what to write.<br>  <br>  I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and we do a lot of PERSONAL STUDY.  I prefer a modern English Bible so I am not struggling with Old English thees, thous, and haths, at the same time trying to get the point of the scripture.<br>  <br>  For me TAKING AN ACTIVE PART keeps things interesting.  For example:  our Sunday meeting is two parts.  The primary talk is usually by a visiting elder and we all use our Bibles and look up the scriptures he cites.  The second part is a question/answer program on a Bible subject using one of our publications (like today it was about how Jesus had very unique positions in God's grand purpose as evidenced by the various titles he held)  We are welcome to give comments, though no one is put on the spot.  I find that if I prepare in advance I am much more attentive.  I like to look for a special scripture to add to my comment.<br>  <br>  And most definitely PRAY to your Father in heaven and tell Him you are searching for Him.  You'll find that He is a hearer of prayers, and wants a personal relationship with you.<br>  <br>  I hope my suggestions  will help.  I love studying God's word and seeing what He has in store for us in the future.  <br>  <br>  I know that if it wasn't for being convinced I found the truth, I wouldn't bother to go to church at all, so I understand your dilemma.|`|AdFucadgaa	Maybe you get bored because its not that interesting the way the homily has been delivered. You can go find a church where it interest you or pray for holy spirit to enlighten your mind and give you the spirit of praying.|`|DA53AFKhaa	Since God is love, love others, try to be centered on helping others, and by loving other you will know love better, and God is love.|`|XfUMGLrxaa	Take your own Bible and study what you like during the service and the Lord will bless your reading of the subject of your choice at your time...|`|jLvfPh8Daa	Question that which they tell you.<br>  If you find something that makes no sense, find the answer elsewhere.<br>  That's what I did, and I am neither ignorant or unhappy!|`|CEQpDpnPaa	bible studies are a great way to get closer to God<br>  <br>  start counting how many times your preacher says the word God   it sounds funny but it can help you focus more on what he is saying|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	Talk to your pastor and tell him.  Maybe he can make it more interesting for you.|`|e67045ea08edd6bf714e0243622a0defaa	Silence your mind and consult your heart. It is the direct line to the 'God' within you. :-)|`|O0PrBp7Yaa	For one, pray. Try to determine why you can't pay attention. <br>  Maybe you should find a new church.|`|ET6SbXGcaa	find a church with a leader that interests you.|`|gGnHOxbTaa	To me it simply sounds like you are bored. Perhaps you don't find the topics engaging or relevant. Perhaps you could use little games to help you stay engaged in the topic. For instance, take notes and when your mind starts to wander see if you can find something about what he was talking about in the concordance in the back of your Bible (if yours doesn't have one, perhaps get one if you can) and sometimes what you find may correlate to something he says later on and so becomes more interesting because you just found it. You could try drawing pictures of what he is talking about and see if they help you see what he is saying in a new light. If your mind wanders, see what it wanders to and see if that can relate to what he is saying. Hmmm...what do apples have to do with prodigal sons? ...sounds like pig fodder to me. Feel free to be a little silly. :)<br>  <br>  You could use these things to find questions to pose to yourself about the topic. Sometimes when you have specific questions, they will be answered by the person speaking, without your having to ask. And if he doesn't answer them, perhaps you could ask him (please excuse my use of "him" if the person is a "her") after service or via email during the week...if you find yourself really wanting an answer and can't find it yourself. <br>  <br>  Usually, the cure for boredom is finding a way to engage yourself in what you are listening to in a way that you enjoy, but also in a way that will add meaning and/or value to your life, otherwise your time is simply being wasted.|`|ndas3nJTaa	Well, depending on how it would work for you, you could look into reality and logic.  I personally think Christianity came from Paganism (like the old Greek and Roman gods).  Take Dionysus for example.  Supposedly born on the 25th of December by the virgin birth of Demeter the earth goddess.  And don't forget Dionysus' identity as the "god of wine."  Turning water into wine...ring any bells?|`|iXpdeuPjaa	I'm kind of scared to answer but i agree with people who say pray and talk to ur preacher, spend more time with God, i try to pray every night, one bible with good plans in the back is the extreme teen bible, but that doesn't mean that u can't take a break once in a while, just make it a routine and enjoy a relationship with ur almighty perfect creator!!!

AA10182088	I just don't know...<br>  but I have thought about why after over a 100 years reparation would warrant logical for us. I think that if we focus on the accomplishments of our people and not to continually  live in the past of the mistakes of others, we might have a better understanding of "Implementation" and not have to carry the weight of the logic behind reparation.|`|16ce5c8b2b4e1c765742c42329522cc5aa	I'm sick of hearing about reparations.  Every race in the world has at some time been victims of abuse or abusers themselves.  If reparation is such a good idea this could get out of hand.  And then everybody all over the world will run around paying each other for the past.  It's time to stop and get on with our lives.|`|d4fef0f6ca92f27b2701290acce6be5daa	sure|`|AA11355939	Well, the Indian tribes get it, in the form of non-taxed casinos on the reservations resulting in very large checks every month!

Nah!  Everyone has a hand open waiting for a hand out!|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	no native nation i know of has ever asked for reparations. the only thing we ask for is for the unites states to honor the treaties it made with our nations. to date the usa has not honored even one of those and by your own constitution, a treaty is to be considered law. <br>  <br>  and we have never been given anything by the government so that lie can stop being spread right now. we are sovereign nations and buy those casinos just like all other non native casinos. you find investors and then pay them back. pretty devious for the government to let people think they give us so much when in fact they are still TAKING from us to this very day.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	They said after the civil war, that every head of house hold who signed up was given 40 acres and a mule.

GPznIhzMaa	Depending on the country, it's required by social law or it's for protection. For example, in countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia, women can buy cars but they have to be driven around by men, usually family members or hired drivers. And then in countries like Afghanistan and Egypt, women can be harassed if they're out in public by themselves.|`|pfke6Jieaa	its for protection. i always accompany my cousins when they need to go somewhere, including my sister and mom. its just for protection thats all. its not true that the man doesnt allow them to go out by themselves. in our culture sometimes we can get protective about our women its the reason why we do that. <br>  <br>  my male cousins do the same thing with their sisters and moms. if we accompany them its less likely that someone will take advantage of them. but i dont really do that too much with my gf because sometimes when she goes to work i dont have to do that. but if she goes out at night, SHE is the one who asks me to come with her but i dont really mind.

Have you even heard of the Mayans and Aztecs? The Aztecs built Tenochtitlan (in Mexico City). A floating city that was able to house and feed about thousand some people... The Greeks were even influenced by the Ancient Egyptians. The Europeans developed a lot of their technology from the Chinese.<br>  <br>  The Mayan calendar is very accurate even till this day. Aztecs, for example. They knew and were very well aware of their Geography. Of course they weren't like the European's (bent on ruling the world). But as for as the North of Mexico, and parts of the south west, they knew their stuff. I think you need to read a book..B/C where and the hell have you been? The technology of the Americas was so great and so modern, that even today archaeologist, can't understand a lot of stuff they did.<br>  <br>  My point is, there is no answer to your question.. Who is smarter. But wasn't the Italians who believed the earth was flat?? Anyways... The parts of the world were certain cultures were living is all that they could really be accounted for. Yes the Europeans were great was far as ships go, so they had the advantage to see other parts of the world... But that doesn't mean they were smarter or better. Im sure if the Aztecs had big a..s..s.. ships like them, they would have gone to so other places as well..|`|vTra7n5baa	Well, in modern history a lot of countries are smarter than America and a lot of those countries know geography better.  Many Americans can't even find their country on a map.  So, I guess those people back in time are smarter when you use this as a standard -- a pretty good standard too.
899c6a371bce238646502edb0cee925aaa	Disney's era - the beginning of cartooning - was quite something (note I'm just a 20-yo saying this).  The time period you're reminiscing was the beginning of the bane of Disney.  Though so many people like it, it's all just old stories with all their significance and character removed and replaced with animals and songs and questionable ideologies.  Nowadays it's just...

It's one way by which we humans compartmentalize others.  It gives a sense of order to those more simple minded.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Stereotyping is the way we are able to recognize things without having seen them before. For instance, when you first learn what a chair is, you get the basic shape of it down and your brain uses that as a template to ID other chairs that are not the exact same model. As long as they have a seat and some form of legs, you can understand that it is a chair. Young children do the same thing when they learn what a dog is, then mistakenly call anything with four legs a dog. It allows you to recognize a human being as being human, even though you have not met them. You have to have stereotyping to avoid having to learn every individual thing in the universe, so, yes, its perfectly natural and needed.|`|BtDGWKSNaa	yes.  we humans like placing people in specific groups so we can organize them better in our minds.  <br>  the definition of a stereotype is a simplified and standardized conception or image invested with special meaning and held in common by members of a group.<br>  what we see is what we know.<br>  when you look at western man, you may think that person is a cowboy.  that is stereotyping.  everyone does it subconsciously.|`|PdY9ylZCaa	sure, we all make snap judgments upon first impressions. anyone who says otherwise is a liar.<br>  <br>  now, that being said, just because one person gave you a bad impression (of them) does not mean it is ok to apply that bad impression on a group of other people whom you've never met.|`|cdWyXgdtaa	i think every single person from a preschooler to ur mom/dad or even the president do. its like that first impression or vibe u get from someone. and i dont think theres something wrong with if u give them a chance to live up to what u think they r or even someone else|`|AA11355939	I don't judge others.  I have friends from every walk of life, religion and nationality.  Some of my friends are skinny, some quite large.  I have found that I learn something from everyone I meet.<br>  <br>  When we judge others we are the ones to lose out.  We cheat ourselves out of experiences that only the other person can give us.  It doesn't matter how intelligent we think we are, everyone can teach us something, a new way to look at something, an appreciation of one of our senses or the love of the companionship of that person.<br>  <br>  I am never disappointed by a new friend or an old one!<br>  <br>  There is nothing 'natural' about prejudice which is just another word for stereotyping.|`|c3cd1088f9f516de2edee8c0396bef5daa	I definitely think people doing it without thinking about it. So, yeah, it comes naturally. But I don't think it's necessarily *good* that it comes so naturally.|`|iqR9aymIaa	i think it is even if your not racist or anything. you could still joke around or say it and not even notice it i do about other races and i no that other races do it to me|`|hZp1S4kNaa	yes i think its natural.

aZ2cTa0Uaa	It is both.  <br>  <br>  Joe should not be relying on a lower employee to be handling management duties, unless Harry Hotdog is an accountant or secretary.  It is actually a case you could bring up with Human Resources if Mr. Hotdog feels intimidated or forced into performing this action because of Joe's authority.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, if the function is not business related, Joe should not be using an employee for his personal matters.<br>  <br>  In a non-business scenario, you never solicit somebody elses e-mail for any sort of gain.  Not only is it quazi-illegal, but it's also rude and can quickly damage trust in the relationship.

It doesn't seem like that big a deal, maybe the supervisor was going to tell you later a bit about what was going on with the function. I would be more concerned if the email said something like "Harry will be hosting a special staff function, including a presentation on his findings of what we could all do as a team to improve productivity and then after his 2 hour presentation you will all debate his findings". <br>  <br>  Then I would be very concerned.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	If he is your supervisor then he can hand you work - have to bite it.

AA10470367	I believe in most cases these people were brought up in a culture of Racism. This is similar to the fanatics we read about in the Middle East. When children are raised from day 1 with hatred toward other select groups and that is all they are allowed to hear or think, then it becomes apparent why they have such radical views. This doesn't mean they can't change but there has to be a force ( God, Mentor, Friend, etc) that encourages them to see the world as it actually exist and break away from their life long influences. However, it seems in many cases these folks look for ( and find) others with similar bigoted views and their deranged beliefs only grow worst. Although I don't believe all men will ever live in peace ( until God returns) because we have seen pure evil in the world, those people aren't necessarily racist. Just evil to ALL who may believe differently.|`|b5TGnDPOaa	It's human nature or better yet mob mentality. Everyone needs someone to hate, I guess.

It happened before we were born, and there's nothing we could have done about it.  There's nothing we can do to make it not have happened.<br>  <br>  Rape was just one of many, many terrible things that people did to each other.  If you want to get some perspective on how cruel people can be to each other, go see Slumdog Millionaire.  The events depicted in that movie happened in the latter half of the 20th century and the early part of this century.  It made me so sad to think that people could do such things to each other.|`|fr5ImqW9aa	Im white and from the south and I don't necessarily have any extra sympathy for rapes that occured during that time.

I mean i think you think you do but, why do you honestly care about something so far away from your life. I am white and i have felt for a very long time that we dont need to forget about slavery at all. The thing is it doesnt need to be constantly  brought up. To move past this issue we have to put it behind us in our present life because when you continue to bring something up it allows people to question if there was a reason to  it. I want equality and as said felt that by people brining stuff up constantly (by the way this stuff is always talked about every day by everyone very few people are scared maybe nervouse.) it brings hate and guilt to the forefront why do you want people that had nothing to with a snipet in history that didnt involve you to constantly feel guilt and as if they owe othere something. Why do you want to feel mad and as though you were wronged. I know my thoughts or all over the place and i am not saying dont have black history month or even talk about in some historical aspects but, as a nation a people lets get past the negatives towards each other today so we can mover forward as a people.<br>  <br>  Id like to think what really got to you in this question is if a woman can feel or did feel bad for the fact another person was being raped in unfortunate circumstances.<br>  <br>  <br>  Im not saying it does not have anything to with you and your color. You came at with the same approach. It wasnt i am the color i am because two diffrent colors mixed or it was in my history back during slavery when i can see where my color came from. It was how do white women feel about this. And yes that written as your title shows you were not making a interesting point you wanted some guilted answer. Such as, it makes me feel terrible how this and that.....Also this sort of was on my mind from an early conversation with a friend. (not the rape bit)|`|CZw2Gpbraa	your not actually black now you must be like 7\8 white and one eighth black because black is breeded out rather quickly, although im not white so i dont have answer to ur question ;]]|`|hBEfrv23aa	I think it is very wrong that ANYTYPE of woman has been raped by any type of person.<br>  <br>  <br>  Are you asking for sympathy only for your race?<br>  <br>  Then sure, I am sympathetic to all those who did get raped.<br>  <br>  <br>  Personally, It wasn't I who raped any black women, and it wasn't you who has been raped. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I think people should get over the slavery thing. I'm pretty sure that after a while the United States government made up for it. <br>  <br>  (and keep in mind, I AM NOT SAYING that the fact that slavery has happened should be forgotten. I'm just saying people need to MOVE ON)|`|lTplgUGnaa	actually ive heard that some black women voluntarily went with the white man but most of our black women were raped while we black men were powerless.|`|8iJe2S2Daa	They still do that in the south. I'm actually not kidding, you can't get a white man convicted of raping a black woman in 2009 for s**t!<br>  <br>  <br>  The white people on here are experiencing what they call "white guilt" and they don't like to talk about things that bother them, don't let them get to you.

o47z1gihaa	In Spanish it has several meanings. <br>  <br>  from the verb asistir: asiste = he/she attends, you attend<br>  --> for example, "ella asiste a la clase" = "she attends the class"<br>  <br>  from the verb asistir: asiste = he/she assists, you assist, he/she helps<br>  --> for example, "ella asiste a los pobres" = "she helps the poor people", but it is more common to use "ayudar" in this context<br>  <br>  from the verb asir: asiste = you seized, you grabbed<br>  --> for example, "la asiste de un brazo" = "you grabbed her by the arm"<br>  <br>  The verb "asistir" has two meanings, "attend" and "assist" or" help".

AA11065099	"C'est la faute de" means "It is the fault of".  I am not sure what it all means, but the speaker obviously is critical of the French media and possibly the French fashion magazines.  The person also is lashing out at the fashion industry.  It would be helpful to know the exact context of this remark.  However, 'Marie-Claire' is a French fashion publication later published and circulated in English as well.  The terms "les maries", "les claires" and "les marie-claire" maybe refer to the fashion magazine 'Marie-Claire' and to ones like it.  It also may refer to the woemen in general whose names inspired them.  "Les figues" literally refers to figs, but is a slang translation as well, for "a prickly pear", and sometimes used to mean "in Jest" (as in the term 'moitié figue'meaning half in jest).  The "Figue" also is a literary award in France, possibly named after the same terminology.<br>  <br>  "Les mattes" refers to matte, an impure product of the smelting of sulphide ores such as copper or nickel.  As an adjective, it is the feminine form of "dull".<br>  <br>  I hope this explanation helps.  you might have to put the information together yourself, based on the context in which you have derived it.<br>  <br>  "Beaucoup trop claires" means way too clear", and maybe refers to the clairty behind the dull polish.  I am not sure.  "Les femmes d'aujourd'hui et hier" means "the women of today and yesterday".|`|81bda06b67f3aa041e733ff5f2351395aa	First of all what does it mean in French? before you try to translate anything.<br>  l just know that Marie Claire and Femme d'Aujourd'hui are French magazines.|`|SicJ7utMaa	It's only my thought and all i understand:<br>  It is the fault of the magazine; married, clear marie-claire, is fig, mat so much clear, the women of today and yesterday.<br>  <br>  *) Marie Claire: monthly American magazine for women that covers topics of general interest (health, beauty, fashion, career, finance, etc.)<br>  *) Fig: contemptouous,disdain or probably trifle|`|BjMoEKltaa	it is the fault of the magazines, married, the clear-marie claire, figs, mattes too clear, the women of today and hie|`|22TnQ7vPaa	it is the fault of the magazines, the marie's the clear, the mary-clear and blah blah blah.
Wmxpi9Amaa	I'm not Christian, but isn't Lent supposed to be about personal sacrifice? Why not shut the TV off the whole time, instead of ust going halfway? And if one is addicted to soda or junk food, that would be a personal sacrifice. Any time you overcome something that has a grip on you or live more simply, you open up a greater mental awareness that could channel your spirituality. So you could indeed pay more attention to all things spiritual with any sincere sacrifice, as I suspect.
rNBXHFlcaa	I don't know how hard Spanish is, but I take French right now, which is also difficult.  I was born in Japan, so I speak it fluently, but I think that as long as you don't have to read or write, it's not a very difficult language.  The grammar is very different and it might be difficult at the beginning, but once you get used to it, I don't think it will be that difficult.  I heard that English speakers suffer when writing Japanese, as there's like millions of characters to memorize, but as long as you don't get into writing, I think it will be the same difficulty as any other language.|`|B7C5PPgdaa	you can enrich your Japanese Vocabulary and Kanji<br>  at:<br>  <a href="http://www.japaneseclass.jp/" rel="nofollow">http://www.japaneseclass.jp/</a><br>  the system of the site makes it more effective to learn Japanese vocabularies and Kanji<br>  <br>  its fun!<br>  just like playing game, earn EXP, gain level, and get Ranked<br>  its good for practice, and keep your motivation up<br>  and its free!|`|KTKxrP7naa	Japanese will be 5-10 times more difficult, for an English speaker, than is Spanish.

XLXncQu9aa	I believe that we as humans all have our own judgments about people in general.  We all do it at some point or another.  You will undoubtedly be judged for choosing not to be mormon by those that know you and even those that don't.  We as humans lack the inability to be judge free.  We try not to judge but because we are human we find every little thing we can pick out about somebody that we deem as unacceptable.  I don't know much about being mormon but I do know that whatever you decide it is your choice.  Don't do things for the sake of pleasing others.  If those that you want to hang with judge you for your choice, then you need to re-evaluate your friendships.  What I have learned is that there is a such thing as good judgment of people and bad judgment.  Good judgment is judging based on something you already know to be true and making a decision based on if it is hurting you or not.  Bad judgment is judging without knowing the facts.  So yes we do judge because we are human, but we need to learn to get to know others before we judge, otherwise we aren't doing anyone a favor and we come off as horrible individuals.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	Mormonism can be very divisive in the Western US areas where there are a lot of them.

There's nothing wrong with her being into a show. <br>  <br>  It's not that Naruto is addicting, it's just a phase that lots of kids get into at some point whether it's Naruto, InuYasha, Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon, or whatever. It's like when teenagers have a favourite band and they get giddy and obsess over it. If you stop her from watching Naruto then she'll just get into something else to obsess over. It's all normal for kids her age. :D<br>  <br>  As I said, your overreacting. Just let it go.

DMkk2yuLaa	what the flag really means:<br>  1. That white southern/rural culture is the true culture of the USA all other cultures are inferior to it.<br>  2. Minorities should be respectful to whites because they are superior and that whites should not mix with other races<br>  3. If society is at odds with white southern/rural culture it is ok to commit treason/violence in defense of that culture. The culture is above the law. <br>  <br>  There are lot of good people who are white southern and or live in a rural communities. But I think its funny though that as patriotic as they think they are (america love it or leave it) if society or the country doesn't agree with them they are quick to act hatefully against it (obama assassination talk) So I'm sure I'll get a lot of thumbs down for this post but all those pro flag people really look into our soul and ask yourself has anything I said untrue|`|ohUm00RYaa	I see it as Jews see the swastika, its a symbol of hate.  Sure Hitler stood for lots of good things.  Before Hitler came to power Germany had no balls and was the laughing stock of Europe.  They were the poorest white country and got no respect.  To many Germans this was the best time in Germany, trains ran on time, everyone had jobs and so on.  But to jews and many other it represents a sad and ark time in history and overbearing message of a symbol of hate and discrimination to jews.  Thats how I view th confederate flag.<br>  <br>  Further half the people waving the flag are people who are part of white supremist grouops anyways<br>  <br>  Look there was a divide but the divide was that the north had finished with slavery and was taking low wage immigrants to work factories and blacks.  The south hated non-northern european immigrants or non whites like irish and italians so they said screw that.  If people from the south hate america so much that they prefer some segregation racist flag oover the real flag why don't they go back to europe where they can go back to white countries!<br>  <br>  States already have self determeination every state is viewed as its own nation and can make anylaw it wants.

As to where the blacks up north in the inner cities are known to commit a big percentage of robberies, rapes and murders anhd are very hated.|`|0pE3dhT8aa	The Confederate battle flag (as I assume you're talking about) is a symbol of resistance to tyranny, and the right of self government. When the South seceded from the union (that it voluntarily entered), it did so in accordance with the same guarantees of self-government that the original thirteen colonies.<br>  <br>  The War for Southern Independence had nothing to do with slavery. Lincoln himself stated that he was only interested in forcing the Southern States back into the union. He offered to let them return to the Union with slaves. If the South was concerned with retaining slavery, the best course of action would have been to return to the union.<br>  <br>  What the South was concerned with, however, was the right to self government. There were many economic issues that had been plaguing the union for some time. Most prominent was the tariff, which unfairly and adversely effected the South, while benefiting the North. This led to much controversy over the years.<br>  <br>  The tensions between the two sections had been going on for many years, and ultimately was the product of a clash of two cultures.<br>  <br>  It would have been better, from the beginning, to follow the advice of Patrick Henry. The North and South should have been two countries, and not one, because the cultures were so different.|`|A1aIOZAkaa	I couldn't agree more with Honestly, now above me. Fresh Jeff, too, although the Swastika thing is a little more complicated than he explained in his answer, as it it -- and has always been, long before Hitler's time -- a geometrical motif and Religious symbol in India and southeast Asia. However, as he says, symbols change over time and come to mean very different things. The Confederate flag and the Swastika are perfect examples of this change.|`|51f7d0ee07bcbaea13dc55784aea7f62aa	The above poster is factually correct in every way.

XLXncQu9aa	I think you cutting goes beyond judging from others.  Its not about them.  It is about you.  You say you are cutting because you are depressed.  Usually individuals like yourself cut because they are hurting.  What you need to do is seek counseling.  Cutting is not normal, and it stems from a psychological disorder that is linked with depression.  Instead of continuing to hurt yourself you need to go to a therapist or counseling to get help professionally.  Cutting is doing harm to your body and it isn't normal.  Judging from others is irrelevant here because regardless of what they think, their opinions don't matter.  What matters is you getting the proper treatments so you can stop cutting.

Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS in the U.S. alone, and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|a584eRKeaa	Hi, and welcome to Yahoo Answers: Mythology & Folklore.<br>  You're obviously new here, so I'll take a moment to give you a few points:<br>  1) Yes, there are many people who believe that vampires are real<br>  2) As well as werewolves, fairies, mermaids, and Frankenstein.<br>  3) Stick around, answer a few questions, and you'll meet more then enough folks of all sorts.<br>  <br>  Welcome to YA: M&F!|`|fhnyfRTxaa	we r real  but nothing like twilight|`|ifyMXX3laa	No, it all started from a queen bathing in the blood of virgins to stay young and beautiful.

WoxA3ilFaa	That sounds like fun actually. The problem is that I don't think there are any degrees from college or UNI that are specifically for that field, however I do know that you can get degrees in Archaeology and Mythology but you will probably have to do them separately, your best option would be to get some info from a bunch of different UNI's and colleges or speak to a career adviser they could tell you what to do. The nest problem is that "treasure hunter" isn't an easy job to come by I think you have to know people to get into it, you also need a lot of money to finance your expeditions or get a sponsor. I'm not saying it's impossible but you will have to work hard and take a few blind risks but I think it would be worth it, it sounds like a great job.|`|9hI653b5aa	I would advise perhaps an archeology degree and a second course in the classics and ancient languages, a good starting point so you read text in the original and draw your own conclusions rather than those of a translator.<br>  As you gave me no ideas which part of the globe you are upon as to where?I've no recommendations|`|GAnysnQhaa	I don't know much about the level of activity you can have as a mythology treasure hunter, but if adventure and fortune you seek then you should try ancient civilizations, mostly pre-columbian and far eastern also you should think about Marine salvage you could on the ocean for NUMA, that should give you some field experience and frieds in high places, you could work part time in college, or whatever, its a risky business, but its sure as hell fun,good luck kid!
Kj4Xyz36aa	Well, this is calling back upon my eighth grade latin classes in catholic school...  "Scio" means I know, "aliquis" means some (referencing people).   "est" is the generic to be verb, so it means "are" or "is".  Obviously "desparatus" means desperate.  Only thing I'm not so sure of is "illus"... It either means "of that lot", or something about light.<br>  <br>  <br>  So, my best guess:  "I know someone of that group who is desperate."<br>  <br>  Hope I helped =)|`|6ec6afa27ccfe7badb1528fec2817bfcaa	literally it says: I know that (as in not-this) someone  is desperate.. but no doubt they used an online translator, because they apparently did not know the conjugation / declensions of the words, and they wrote desparatus: typo.. like many english speakers write desparate in stead of desperate.|`|NedQpmU0aa	I know someone who is desperate

AA10614558	No. Credit reports only give your address, not the rent you paid. It will reflect if you miss payments or are evicted. Most of the credit score is based on loans you take out and pay (or not pay). School loans, credit cards, auto. What kills most are medical expenses; more people file for bankruptcy based on exorbitant medical bills than any other cause.

You would be wise to stop using the abbreviations commonly used in text-messaging.   ( If you mean "please",  don't write "plz")   If you use those abbreviations, you will find it more  difficult to spell words the right way in English.

Before he became a Pope, he talked about modernism and that he was for it (this is so that he would have a better chance at being elected), then when he was elected the Pope he was totally against modernism.  The Traditions of the Church are very important.<br>  <br>  Pope St. Pius X was the only pope since Pope St. Pius V (r. 1566-1572) to have been canonized as a saint of the Church. In 1907 his Holy Office published the famous decree Lamentabili Sane, in which 65 propositions drawn from the works of Modernist writers were condemned, and he himself issued the encyclical Pascendi, in which he outlined the errors of Modernism, described as the "synthesis of all heresies." He suppressed and removed from the seminaries and universities Modernist teachers and in 1910 required that all priests take the Anti-Modernist oath. In his motu proprio Inter Pastoris Officii Sollicitudines (1903), he promoted the restoration of sacred music through the liturgical use of Gregorian chant.|`|rU6nh42Eaa	I think this link will help you.

I always seem to perform better at the last minute, but I know that this isn't good.  The only way to overcome it, in my opinion, is to give yourself mini-deadlines.  Divide up your project into feasible goals and write them in a day-planner or on a calendar or white board.  Reward yourself with a hobby you enjoy after accomplishing your small goals so it seems more like play than work.
gfuybX4Faa	According to The Straight Dope:<br>  <br>  "The custom of saying "God bless you" after a sneeze was begun literally as a blessing. Pope Gregory the Great (540-604 AD) ascended to the Papacy just in time for the start of the plague (his successor succumbed to it). Gregory (who also invented the ever-popular Gregorian chant) called for litanies, processions and unceasing prayer for God's help and intercession. Columns marched through the streets chanting, "Kyrie Eleison" (Greek for "Lord have mercy"). When someone sneezed, they were immediately blessed ("God bless you!") in the hope that they would not subsequently develop the plague. All that prayer apparently worked, judging by how quickly the plague of 590 AD diminished.<br>  <br>  The connection of sneezing to the plague is not the first association of sneezing with death. According to Man, Myth, and Magic: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Mythology, Religion and the Unknown, many cultures, even some in Europe, believe that sneezing expels the soul--the "breath of life"--from the body.  That doesn't seem too far-fetched when you realize that sneezing can send tiny particles speeding out of your nose at up to 100 miles per hour!<br>  <br>  We know today, of course, that when you sneeze, your heart doesn't stop, nor will your eyes pop out if you can keep them open (www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_30 4.html), nor does your soul get expelled. What does get expelled are hundreds upon thousands of microscopic germs. The current advice when you sneeze is to cover your mouth with your arm rather than your hand. That way, all those germs won't be on your hands when you touch the countless things you're going to touch in the course of the day (don't tell us; we don't want to know)."|`|aZ2cTa0Uaa	It's not biblical, exactly.<br>  <br>  "...

There are 8 known levels, and with each level new secrets are revealed. <br>  <br>  I think it's level 3 (could be wrong) when the Xenu story is introduced. Xenu is an evil intergalactic overlord who, for fear of losing power, froze a bunch of aliens and shipped them in airships to volcanos on earth. He then dropped H-bombs on these volcanos. All that remained were alien spirits (or thetans). The thetans were vacuumed up and brainwashed to believe in religion, self-identity, etc. The thetans formed clusters and eventually attached to evolving humans, causing consciousness and all pain and evil in the world.

6ELSwKKvaa	This should not be done in text. You should talk to her face to face so you can get a read on what she is feeling when you tell her. Basically let her know that you like her but that you would not pressure her to return the feelings since she is obviously straight. Explain to her that you don't want her talking to people about it because some people would be terribly mean about it or things might become awkward and you don't want that.<br>  <br>    Also, don't get it in your head that you are going to turn a straight to gay.

If you and Jane are like really good friends lets say best friends i think she'll still talk to you because I'm sure she doesn't wanna lose your friendship.

Some priests or monks do wear them; others do not.  As for the "white collar", some priests and ministers wear them and some do not.  Lay people (non-clergy) do not wear them.  But in neither case is it necessary to wear them to get into heaven.<br>  <br>  LDS (Mormon) temple garments are something else.  I will pass over this lightly as I know that LDS get upset when this subject is handled irreverently.  These are special items of clothing that are utilized in LDS religious ceremonies inside their Temples.  They can only be worn by "worthy" members.  <br>  <br>  One thing that is not commonly known about Mormons is that they have three levels of heaven.  The top level (Celestial Kingdom) is where God lives and where most LDS aspire to go as well.  But to reach this level of heaven, you must go through the LDS "endowment ceremony" in the LDS Temple.  <br>  <br>  Therefore, this is the main difference.  In the Catholic and Protestant worlds, you can gain access to God in heaven without wearing either the scapular or the "white collar"...but you can't gain access to God the Father in the LDS version of heaven without wearing special "temple garments".<br>  <br>  By the way, I have been Catholic, Mormon (LDS), and Baptist (protestant), before returning to the Roman Catholic faith recently.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	Nothing/They are the same difference.Besides, the LDS garments noticeable unless you are purposely looking for them.|`|TjPMkwK8aa	yes, except they designed the clothing to show people how special you are compared to everyone else.

LJlaHLQdaa	A Spiritual Revival<br>  <br>   The children of the captivity who had returned with Ezra "offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel" for a sin offering and as a token of their gratitude and thanksgiving for the protection of holy angels during the journey. "And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God." Verses 35, 36.<br>  <br>  Very soon thereafter a few of the chief men of Israel approached Ezra with a serious complaint. Some of "the people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites" had so far disregarded the holy commands of Jehovah as to intermarry with the surrounding peoples. "They have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons," Ezra was told, "so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people" of heathen lands; "yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass." Ezra 9:1, 2. <br>  <br>   In his study of the causes leading to the Babylonish captivity, Ezra had learned that Israel's apostasy was largely traceable to their mingling with heathen nations. He had seen that if they had obeyed God's command to keep separate from the nations surrounding them, they would have been spared many sad and humiliating experiences. Now when he learned that notwithstanding the lessons of the past, men of prominence had dared transgress the laws given as a safeguard against apostasy, his heart was stirred within him. He thought of God's goodness in again giving His people a foothold in their native land, and he was overwhelmed with righteous indignation and with grief at their ingratitude. "When I heard this thing," he says, "I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied.<br>  <br>  "Then were assembled unto me everyone that trembled at the words of God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice." Verses 3, 4.<br>  <br>   At the time of the evening sacrifice Ezra rose, and, once more rending his garment and his mantle, he fell upon his knees and unburdened his soul in supplication to Heaven. Spreading out his hands unto the Lord, he exclaimed, "O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to Thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	do think Larry of the three stooges was on to something when he used to pull out his hair.

Religion has played a role in politics as long as there has been political structure. The reason for this is because religion is not something someone does in their spare time, it is a way of life. If a person models their life around their religion, then they are going to incorporate that into what they do for a living. If you are so disgusted with religion in politics, then you have the right to vote for someone who is not religious. But in no way have any of your rights been encroached by religion.

7ALEGSFaaa	Your answer will be found in Mathew 24:35-36; Mark 13:31-32; see Acts 1:7; but Luke 21:36 and; Matthew 6:33-34<br>  One thing about Jesus saying He doesn't know when the hour will come. Remember, Jesus was fully God and fully HUMAN at the same time while on earth. For me, it's hard to understand because of my puny finite. Maybe that's why He didn't know all things on earth. His Father revealed to Him what need to be revealed to Him while on earth. But now that Jesus is in heaven back on His throne, I think He knows now when He will come back. <br>  <br>  O hope this answers your question. Personally, why waist your time worrying about when the world will end when the Bible says not to worry about it?

The Christians I know hate gays and smoke and I think that smoking is a worse sin because it kills others but being gay does not hurt any one.|`|16ce5c8b2b4e1c765742c42329522cc5aa	Smokers are not committing a sin.  But people who judge smokers are probably committing a sin.  Whatcha think?|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Yup, but no one's perfect, thanks ;)|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	LOL! If smoking is a "slow form of suicide," then LIVING is a slow form of suicide. It's only suicide, by definition, if you are intentionally trying to kill yourself. People who smoke ignore the fact it is killing them, but they do not do it to die. So it is NOT a conscious decision to shorten their life. In any case, dying is not a sin. We're all going to kick the bucket one day. Whenever you get in a car or eat a cheeseburger you are taking the chance of killing yourself. So I'd say your argument is gone up in smoke.|`|DfBH8Dr9aa	I don't smoke because I was able to quit. Most people want to quit smoking but they are addicted. It has nothing to do with what they believe.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	In a sense...<br>  <br>  "Existence in General" is a very slow form of suicide...|`|yCdcF3Jcaa	That's in the gray area.|`|aZ2cTa0Uaa	Cigarettes are a form of suicide, yes.

There isn't any way to avoid it; merely pray that God provides a divine shield that allows longevity.<br>  <br>  FUN FACTS: smoking in and of itself is NOT dangerous.

Logically it is a sin only to those who know that it is sin. So if you know it is a sin, it is one but even God has given the gift of choice to all humans. So who are we to find fault? Pointing the finger at others is a bigger sin because we think we are righteous. <br>  <br>  When we choose the right, we get blessings and when we choose the bad, we have to bear the consequences. God gave us rules not for him to be happy but for us to be happy and when we follow the rules, it is a way that opens the door for God to help us. If you try keeping one commandment given to us, you will see your whole life changing 360 degrees, thats how God works not in bits and pieces but dramatically when you do your small bit. If you test God you will understand that He exists. <br>  <br>  Be happy. No matter whatever you do, God loves you. <br>  <br>  The choices of our life here on earth paves a way for our life after death. Hell is just the immense sadness and regret you feel that you the chance of a big opportunity and you purposely chose to miss it because you did not even give it a try just for the hell of it.|`|rU6nh42Eaa	Not really, but an extremely stupid choice.  No one smokes in an effort to hasten the end of his life.  He knows it does, but it's not for that reason, therefore not really slow suicide.<br>  <br>  The sin is in being terribly irresponsible with ones health and setting a bad example for others.  The personal downside is the waste of money, the stench, and the addictive preoccupation.  I quit smoking 3 months ago, and am so glad I did.  It's a little more boring, but that's not important.|`|5a2969878efc1ea28cb5f1d0e5c13b07aa	in a sense, living is a very slow form of suicide. There are many things that shorten your lifespan, like not eating right, not getting enough exercise etc.... So where do you draw the line, is it a slow form of suicide when you don't exercise and eat healthy as often as possible? Will we all be banished to a lake of fire for eternity because we ate too much ice cream, and didn't do strenuous aerobic exercises often enough? That's stupid.|`|uuQkTMiSaa	Defiling the flesh is a sin....no matter how you slice it. (2?Corinthians 7:1)  It is deliberate misuse of our body.

In the old testament, marriage was literally a contract.  You were buying keepers of the home and associates in your trade from their rightful owners.  Usually, all wives were not used for breeding or romantic purposes and marriage wasn't about the "love between two souls".  <br>  <br>  I don't believe it actually states it as a "sin" in the new testament.  However, society changed and people began using marriage as a sexual contract and women were not allowed to do as much.  Women were also not given as much land in their inheritance as before, so the ratio tilted from earning MORE money with MORE wives, to earning LESS money with MORE wives.  <br>  <br>  There is a rather humorous old saying that kind of hints towards this, "Never marry more wives than you can afford".  <br>  <br>  The morality and intelligence behind multiple partnerings came into question, and many churches began to deem polygamy as "unclean" according to the teachings of God.  <br>  <br>  When Jesus came, he took many of the best and unchanged of the old laws and combined it with a newer translation (a modern translation) of the changed laws to create what we consider a "new set" of sins.  If you look at it in the context of society, however, you'd realize that it really didn't change at all.|`|c64d6c7caaa6ff5455c25c84c0d7cbc8aa	Same reason we are allowed today.Because God made woman for man so why wouldnt they be allowed?The NT does not speak against multiple wives.And Jesus Christ is seen as the husban and all the christians as the bride.All the bible is spiritual.If ur not spiritual u wont understand shi. and ur gonna find alot of contradictions.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	It was not allowed, just tolerated.

Taylor, em 1871, na sua obra Primitive Culture (A Cultura Primitiva).<br>  Pelo termo Animismo, ele designou a manifesta??o religiosa na qual se atribui a todos os elementos do cosmos (Sol, Lua, estrelas), a todos os elementos da natureza (rio, oceano, montanha, floresta, rocha), a todos os seres vivos (animais, árvores, plantas) e a todos os fen?menos naturais (chuva, vento, dia, noite) um princípio vital e pessoal, chamado de "anima", que na vis?o cosmocêntrica significa energia, na antropocêntrica significa espírito e na teocêntrica alma.<br>  Consequentemente, todos esses elementos s?o passíveis de possuirem: sentimentos, emo??es, vontades ou desejos, e até mesmo inteligência. Resumidamente, os cultos animistas alegam que: "Todas as coisas s?o Vivas", "Todas as coisas s?o Conscientes", ou "Todas as coisas têm anima".<br>  O Animismo possui três simples regras:<br>  Tudo no cosmo tem "anima"; <br>  Todo o "anima" é transferível; <br>  Tudo ou todo que transfere "anima" n?o perde a totalidade de seu "anima", mas quem ou que recebe perde parte ou a totalidade de seu "anima", o qual será tomado pelo "anima" doador. <br>  A partir da década de 50, o termo deixa de ser utilizado pela Antropologia por ser considerado muito genérico, uma vez que se aceita que elementos animistas est?o presentes em quase todas as religi?es.<br>  Atualmente, discute-se quais foram historicamente os primeiros cultos que deram origem a todas as religi?es e a todos os deuses. Alguns historiadores e cientistas defendem a tese de que foram os mitos politeístas, enquanto outros afirmam que foram os cultos animistas.<br>  <br>  <br>  Uso do Termo no Espiritismo<br>  Na literatura espírita, o termo Animismo é usado para desginar um tipo de fen?meno onde é o Espírito encarnado no próprio médium que se manifesta por ele.<br>  Para melhor entendimento desse fen?meno, convém usarmos as denomina??es utilizadas pelo estudioso espírita Hermínio Miranda, quais sejam, a de chamarmos o Espírito, que, segundo o Espiritismo, tem uma infinidade de existências, de individualidade, chamando cada uma das existências do mesmo de uma de suas personalidades.<br>  Admitida a pluralidade das existências, resta evidente que a individualidade deve possuir um conhecimento imensamente superior ao de cada uma de suas personalidades, pois soma ao conhecimento da atual personalidade tudo o que aproveitou das que representou nas existências pregressas.<br>  Desse modo, na manifesta??o anímica, o médium pode expressar muitos conhecimentos que ele, enquanto personalidade, n?o possui. Daí decorre, muitas vezes, que n?o há como se saber se uma manifesta??o é anímica ou realmente mediúnica, ocorrendo esta última t?o somente quando o Espírito que se comunica n?o é o que está encarnado no médium.<br>  é bom saber que n?o existe uma dicotomia entre fen?meno anímico e fen?meno mediúnico.

Eles foram escritos em Hebraico, Aramaico e grego, entre o século II a.C. e o primeiro século depois de Cristo. Foram encontrados mais de oitocentos textos, representando vários pontos de vista, incluindo as cren?as dos Essénios e outras seitas.<br>  <br>  Os textos s?o importantes por serem praticamente os únicos documentos bíblicos judaicos hoje existentes relativos a este período e porque eles podem explicar muito sobre o contexto político e religioso nos tempos do nascimento do Cristianismo. Os pergaminhos contêm pelo menos um fragmento de todos os livros do das escrituras hebraicas, exceto o livro de Ester. Além de fragmentos bíblicos, contêm regras da comunidade, escritos apócrifos, filactérios, calendários e outros documentos."<br>  A grande importancia desses achados é que prova que a Bíblia como a conhecemos hoje n?o difere da conhecida na época de Jesus Cristo, nosso Salvador.<br>  Um grande abra?o.|`|3d02b91ab59d2905513043a192d2f501aa	Uns pergaminhos escritos por um povo já extinto, os essênios e que foram encontrados em grutas no Mar Morto em 1948.

a7ai1Hg2aa	Creio que nem mesmo Judas o Iscariotes provocou tamanha desgra?a com rela??o a pris?o, o a?oitamento e crucifica??o de Jesus Cristo, como o vaticano tem feito nos últimos séculos com a distor??o do Evangelho de Cristo. O vaticano sempre foi uma cúpula política do clero na arrecada??o e acumula??o de riquezas e tesouros inestimáveis, tudo em nome de Cristo. A inquisi??o foi a maior hecatombe promovida pela Igreja Católica, erradicando milhares de vidas em nome de uma religi?o impositora e cruel. A Igreja comanda o estado e o estado se submete aos caprichos dos sarcedotes. Em nossa atualidade isso vem sendo camuflado, mas a influência da Igreja ainda é notável, principalmente na regula??o da distribui??o da riqueza entre as camadas mais pobres e miseráveis da sociedade. O vaticano é riquissímo, tendo até moeda própria!!! cunhada nos por?es abarrotados de pe?as e relíquias - Existe traidor maior de seus próprios princípios, que seriam igualdade entre os povos e erradica??o da pobreza. O Papa Bento está chegando ao Brasil e levará consigo todos os apetrechos que lhe ser?o ofertados pelas comunidade e autoridades constituídas, como móveis de seu quarto, medalhas comemorativas, roupas especiais bordadas em fios de ouro, fora as oferendas dos fiés católicos, que se sacrificam para receber um pouco das migalhas que caem dessa grande távola de soberba e ostenta??o religiosa. N?o aceito que nenhuma espécie de religi?o usurpe os direitos das pessoas em manifestar sua fé, sejam igrejas católicas, protestante, evangélicas ou espiritualistas. Esta é minha opin?o; O próprio Vaticano rejeita o Cristo verdadeiro.|`|AA12005596	A Igreja Católica, ao longo dos séculos, cometeu muitos erros. Alguns deles foram reconhecidos pelos Papas, mormente Jo?o Paulo II, que chegou a pedir perd?o em nome do Catolicismo. Se tais erros, na sua opini?o, foram trai??o a Jesus, é subjetivo. Eu vejo simplesmente como excesso de zelo, busca de poder e despotismo.

Portanto, chegou-se à conclus?o de que quem acredita em reencarna??o tem mais problemas de memória. Ponto. A partir dessa informa??o factual, pode-se tirar algumas interpreta??es, e a mais coerente foi apresentada. Mesmo porque se considerarmos que só no último século a popula??o humana mais do que dobrou, por uma quest?o simples de matemática fica claro que n?o haveria um acúmulo de "almas na fila" suficiente para reencarnar em tanta gente. A idéia da reencarna??o poderia fazer sentido em uma época que a popula??o existisse em um número pequeno e estagnado, e em que cren?as criadas em volta do desconhecido ditavam as regras. Hoje, com as informa??es factuais históricas e o conhecimento científico de que dispomos, tal hipótese é totalmente descabida.|`|3ece5b0245291693b032aa64eb4fb3ddaa	N?o sou cardecista, ou espirita , tenho minha religi?o que vai de encontro ao espiritismo , sou católica.

fa80d1b0e273ebcb9078e4827baacd4faa	Momentan kaufen wir am liebsten bei Tegut oder bei Alnatura ein. Nach den ganzen Skandalen haben wir als Verbraucher ziemlich das Vertrauen in die konventionelle Lebensmittelindustrie mit ihren Schweinereien verloren. Deshalb versuchen etwas bewusster statt billig einzukaufen. Dafür entscheiden wir genau, was wir wirklich brauchen und was nicht. Kleines Beispiel: Wenn ich Nudeln mit Hacksosse plane, muss ich für Zwei nicht unbedingt 500 gr. Billighackfleisch (mit Risiko auf Gammel- etc.) kaufen. Lieber nehme ich 300 gr. anst?ndiges Hack von meinem Metzger aus dem Kaff, wo ich wohne. Der schlachtet n?mlich tats?chlich noch selbst und wenn er Schmuh machen würde und das rauskommt, w?re er schnell pleite. Die Leute aus dem Dorf sind bei solchen Sachen n?mlich sehr eigen.<br>  <br>  Um eines gleich mal zu bemerken. Wir sind beileibe nicht das, was landl?ufig unter "?kos" l?uft ;-))) Aber wenn ich jeden Tag verfolge, was so im Lebensmittelbereich abgeht, vergeht mir jeder Appetit.<br>  <br>  Deshalb unser Fazit:<br>  <br>  Lieber Klasse als Masse! Und dafür legen wir gerne ein paar Cent mehr drauf. Schliesslich gebe ich auch sonst ordentlich Geld für Unsinn aus, den ich nicht unbedingt br?uchte.<br>  <br>  Und zum Schluss eine kurze Anmerkung noch:<br>  Wenn mehr Leute wenigstens nicht nur nach dem Motto "Geiz ist geil, geiler, am Geilsten!" im Food-Bereich einkaufen würden, w?ren solche Skandale wie sie in der Vergangenheit aufgeflogen sind, nicht mehr in der H?ufung m?glich.

The only way to decide whether or not you want to allow her to kiss other people and have a threesome is to talk about it amongst yourselves. Sure other people can answer it for you, like right now, but they are not you and therefore do not know what you deem to be right or wrong. <br>  <br>  Personally, I'm up for the idea of a threesome, but my girlfriend of 4 years isn't. We discussed it and decided that maybe sometime in the future it might be a possibility, but not right now. <br>  <br>  The only way to decide is to talk it over, explain that right now you're uncomfortable with it. After 2 years of being in a committed relationship, she should respect your objections and accept that since it makes you uncomfortable, it's not a good idea.<br>  <br>  But as I said before, it's a personal decision you will have to discuss with her until a choice is made.

Enquanto, nos pares aleatórios de indivíduos a média está abaixo de 8%. <br>  As evidencias indicam que a orienta??o sexual tem uma base genética. <br>  E demonstram que o caráter e as características individualizadas de uma pessoa n?o s?o enraizados pelo meio ambientes em que a mesma vive.|`|Y2JMt9Inaa	bom na minha opini?o eu acho que a pessoa quando é pra ser homossexual ja é desde que nasceu, pois ja tem tendencias! acho que é algo natural e que repreender so leva tristeza e dor para a pessoa!|`|AA12005596	No livro "Vida e Sexo" do espírito Emmanuel, psicografado por Chico Xavier, o homossexualismo "n?o encontra explica??o fundamental nos estudos psicológicos que tratam do assunto em bases materialistas, mas é perfeitamente compreensível à luz da Reencarna??o" (Página 89) [ esta cita??o foi retirada da palestra virtual proferida pelo Dr. Américo Domingos em 1997] A "tendência homossexual" e o "homossexualismo" s?o duas coisas bastante diferentes. Pelo menos representam uma mesma problemática, só que em níveis distintos. Quando um indivíduo sente em si uma "tendência homossexual", ou seja, atra??o de ordem sexual - ou mesmo afetiva - por outro indivíduo do mesmo sexo, acontece um processo interessante a nível espiritual. A psicoterapia trata essa "tendência homossexual" como "transtorno de identidade sexual", segundo a Dra. Carmita H.N. Abdo - médica psiquiatra, psicoterapeuta, professora do Departamento de Psiquiatria da Faculdade de Medicina da USP e coordenadora do Projeto Sexualidade do Hospital das Clínicas. <br>  <br>  O Espiritismo nos diz, no entanto, que essa "confus?o de identidade sexual" guarda, como nos diz Emmanuel, sua raiz na reencarna??o. Por quê? Porque o indivíduo espiritual é aquilo que ele pensa. Quando se mantém ligado mentalmente a uma organiza??o física tem uma dificuldade IMENSA de utilizar outro corpo carnal sem que essa liga??o mental seja desfeita. O que isso significa? Um indivíduo que encarne como homem e, nessa encarna??o, ligue-se doentiamente ao sexo, em disfun??es e abusos que deixem sua mente entorpecida como objeto-corpo-feminino. Certamente em uma encarna??o futura essa liga??o mental n?o estará desfeita. E é por isso que, encarnando num corpo feminino, sentirá tendências que superar?o a forma??o hormonal e física do corpo, porque está enraizada no seu espírito. <br>  <br>  Assim a Reencarna??o - e o Espiritismo - falam da homossexualidade. O homossexualismo, mais do que isso, é a utiliza??o da homossexualidade em atitudes sexuais. Na realidade, convém que, em foro íntimo, cada qual se pergunte independente da orienta??o sexual, se está fazendo do sexo algo útil, bom, proveitoso, santo. Se o amor impera sempre ou s?o os impulsos. Essas respostas trar?o à pessoa a conclus?o sobre que tipo de processo está sofrendo, e que nível de liga??o mental - e comprometimento espiritual - está tendo perante a vida.

2LcyVsrlaa	We have been counseled by our leaders to store 1 year's supply of food for a very, very, very long time.  Actually, I'm surprised that you just heard it.  But yes, it's true and yes it's for a good reason.  Suppose that there is a disaster and there is no way to get to food for several months.  Or suppose that the provider(s) lose their jobs and have no way to support or provide for the family.  Or suppose that the world economies collapse and food prices skyrocket.<br>  <br>  There are many scenarios where a food storage is very useful and a very good idea.   In fact, in my home we have lived off our food storage many times.  <br>  <br>  Following is the LDS church website on food storage.<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  Also not intending disrespect...<br>  <br>  It's long been a goal to be as self-reliant and self-sustaining as possible.  While the current unemployment rate is troubling, we have been counseled to store food since the 19th century when Brigham Young said that we should put away wheat and barley against times of famine.  <br>  <br>  I think that the current economic climate is just another reason to do it.<br>  <br>  Currently we are being advised that if we can't afford a whole year's supply (and few can!) to start with a week, then a month and slowly build up.  The website shows some ideas on what to store, amounts and how to preserve it.|`|q5lreoiWaa	This is true for all Mormons around the world- though we are counselled to store food for at least one year- though you can aim for more.<br>    The reasons are manifold- unemployment of the family's major breadwinner, economic decline on the whole,natural disaster like a tornado or hurricane, simply being unable to access shopping for a time as in prolonged illness.<br>  Not just food, but garden supplies, sewing needs, generators, sanitary needs etc.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	For many years, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been encouraged to keep on hand a years supple of food. This is for self sufficiency and emergency needs.  It is not only for times of famine, but it is also for times when the parents may be laid -off of work or there is a crisis in the family.  Mormons are taught to be self suffiencet and not be a dole.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	We've been asked to do this, yes.  I think most of us are going for six months' worth of food instead of eighteen, and some are just glad when they have an extra box of cereal stashed away, but we've been asked to keep food and other emergency supplies on hand in case something ever happens.  We haven't been warned about any specific emergency (nor is this a recent thing, as Mormons have been doing this for years), but it's really just common sense.  I've been in situations where hurricanes or riots made shopping and replenishing supplies an utter impossibility, and food storage kept myself and my roommates alive until things calmed down.  I've also had friends who used their food storage to feed themselves after a job was lost and they couldn't afford to pay for groceries.  It's a major pain in the butt, to be frank, but it's good sense to do this.  <br>  <br>  And it's actually a world-wide thing.  We have members in most countries, and we've all been asked to keep a supply of food on hand.  The church also has food stored away in case of emergencies.  These supplies are shipped out to people in need or people in disaster areas (as with Katrina.  The supply trucks were already en route before the hurricane even touched down).  It's just our way of looking out for ourselves and each other, I guess.|`|LcYeN6m5aa	I've only got a months worth stored up beyond what I normally use, but I'm a broke college student right now.  <br>  <br>  I actually have had to use mine a couple times now, but it's a good idea for anyone!<br>  <br>  I'm also stocked up on emergency savings just in case and have a 5 gallon reserve in my van just in case.....I nearly got stranded in a blizzard and we already had water and food in the van for my 2 kids and my wife and me, plus some extra gas.....<br>  <br>  D&C 38:30 "....if ye are prepared ye shall not fear"|`|Tcu0NWkUaa	Thanks for the thoughtful question.  Yes, we have been counseled for several decades by our Church leaders to have a years supply of food and clothing on hand (also fuel where possible).  It is not given in anticipation of any great disaster, though that may be, but for any crisis that may arise.<br>  <br>  I have been very thankful that I followed my leaders advice on more than one occasion.  I once lost my employment and had to rely on the storage I had on hand.  I was grateful that I didn't need to seek government welfare.  It is also nice to have a supply on hand in case a family member or neighbor runs into hard times, so that we can come to their aid as much as possible.<br>  <br>  At the time the counsel was first given it had no mention of our national unemployment rate or our current financial crisis.  We feel it is inspired by God and, if we look at today's situation throughout the world, we can see the value of that inspiration.  Yes, the Church is worldwide and the counsel has been given for all members.|`|AA10880624	It's absolutely true. You should have food storage too. What will you do if you and your wife lose your jobs? What will you do if your city is hit by a hurricane and food can't be delivered for days? <br>  <br>  You ask this question like is bizarre that Mormons have food storage but what is bizarre is that you question a provident lifestyle.|`|AA11402196	Yes, Mormons do store up to a year supply of food. The same way that Mormons do not borrow to build their places of worship (churches and temples). These are the teachings of the Church.<br>  <br>  If you have questions about what Mormons belief, ask a Mormon. See <a href="http://www.mormon.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.mormon.org</a>|`|up40wvywaa	It is not just the Mormons storing food and water along with other daily needs. Many who believe in end times prophecy are also storing up. So are many who just want to make sure in these hard times that they will have enough to support their families.|`|FsX5VoXKaa	Dear beloved, If you know that you are destined to win, why are you concerned if there will be enough to eat?  <br>  <br>  Jesus said Himself, :"Do not worry saying what shall we eat, or what shall we wear? For the Lord knows you need all these things. Seek first the Kingdom, and it SHALL(not maybe but definitely) be added unto you (on top of what you already have).<br>  <br>  Even the birds of the air arent storing up anything and they can be sold for a penny..  are you not worth much more in the eyes of the Lord? <br>  <br>  I'm not mad.. just wanna make sure that the other answers here dont cause you to worry unnecessarily..<br>  <br>  <br>  Do not worry about the unemployment in the world today... Did not Egypt go through the same famine during Josephs care? There was also a famine when Issac was in Gerar..   What did Issac and joseph do? <br>  <br>  They sowed..  DURING THE FAMINE!!  Today, in the time of famine, we should sow! <br>  <br>  What would be the result?  Genesis 26:12  Issac sowed in that land and in the same year reaped a HUNDREDFOLD   WOW!!! <br>  <br>  Please say amen...    Amen means "so shall it be in my life"  ...  say amen to catch the blessing.. <br>  <br>  Therefore, there is no need to hoard.. but please save some money so that there is a reserve to bless your family and others like Joseph did..|`|AA11503457	I don't blame them who knows what tomorrow will bring.

Note que no capítulo 31 é dado o resultado do afastamento de Saul daquEle que somente é onisciente - Deus.<br>  <br>  Tentaremos analisar o capítulo 28 de I Samuel, mas vejamos algumas passagens que esclarecem o porquê do afastamento de Deus ao rei Saul. O Senhor desde os tempos antigos recomenda que o Seu povo n?o recorra a deus estranho nem quem ministra nesse objetivo (Levítico 18:21; Deuteron?mio 18:10). Por quê? Porque Deus considera isso abomina??o (II Reis 16:3). Provoca Deus a ira (II Reis 17:17).<br>  <br>  Oséias 4:12 apresenta uma severa advertência ao que consulta a deuses e adivinhos de acordo com suas conveniências e apego. “Pedem a um peda?o de pau que revele o futuro e fazem perguntas a uma coluna de madeira. Eles me abandonaram. Como uma mulher que se torna prostituta, eles me abandonaram e se entregaram a deuses pag?os.” (Oséias 4:12 NTLH)<br>  <br>  Logo no início desse capítulo fica claro que o drama do rei Saul chamava-se filisteus. Davi, o desafeto do rei de Israel, com seu pequeno exército de seiscentos homens e suas respectivas famílias encontravam-se mais uma vez fugidos em Ziclague e sob os cuidados de Aquis, rei de Gate, terra dos filisteus. Por esse tempo o profeta Samuel, conselheiro do rei, era morto e Davi dizimava alguns povoados nas proximidades da judéia. O rei de Gate desejou que Davi fosse seu general. Por esse tempo morre e é sepultado em Ramá o profeta; Saul havia banido de Israel os médiuns e os adivinhos (v3). Os filisteus se ajuntaram e vieram acampar-se em Suném, enquanto o exército de Israel sob o comando de Saul se prepara em Gilboa (v4).<br>  <br>  Saul que sempre fora homem de guerra, mais uma vez tremeu ao avistar os seus inimigos (v5). Como ele era rei do povo de Deus resolveu primeiramente consultar ao Deus de Israel, mas o Senhor já n?o era mais com Saul (v5 e 6). Algumas décadas após isso aconteceria também do Senhor se afastar do rei Salom?o, por esse aderir às idolatrias de suas mulheres pag?s, e como conseqüência o reino de Israel seria dividido.<br>  <br>  Desta feita o Senhor n?o foi com o rei de Israel. Esse resolveu apelar para uma mulher médium para a consultar (v7). Saul se disfar?ou enrolado em roupa e seguiu de noite, como que às escondidas, na companhia de dois seguran?as até En-Dor. Isso para que a necromante manifestasse o espírito de que Saul indicasse (v8). Ocorre que no passado Saul mandou matar alguns médiuns e adivinhos e, desterrar a outros. Por isso a mulher ficou com medo, porque achou que fosse uma cilada (v9). Saul, mesmo sem se identificar, vergonhosamente jurou pelo Senhor que nenhum castigo lhe sobreviria por isso (v10).<br>  <br>  Imagine quem é que Saul queria que a médium incorporasse sen?o ao seu antigo consultor, agora morto (v11). Em seguida, note que a médium que deveria ter algum conhecimento da pessoa de Samuel, realmente entende ver o espírito do profeta e rapidamente percebe que quem estar na sua presen?a n?o é o consultor do rei, mas o próprio (v12). Fica patente que a médium achava que aquele homem disfar?ado era Samuel. é bem provável que ela ainda n?o sabia da recente morte do profeta.<br>  <br>  Após o disfarce sossegou a médium e lhe perguntou o que via, ao que respondeu “um deus que sobe da terra” (v13). Por que ela disse um deus? Saiba que o diabo tem poder para se transfigurar em até como anjo de luz (II Coríntios 11:14), com o firme propósito de enganar. Agora, Saul sabedor de como se encontrava a aparência de Samuel um pouco antes de sua morte, quis colocá-la a prova perguntando qual era a sua figura, ao que respondeu “um anci?o e está envolto numa capa”. Neste momento, entendendo Saul que se tratava do espírito de Samuel, se prostrou com o rosto em terra (v14), em sinal de submiss?o.<br>  <br>  A bíblia diz que o diabo anda em derredor bramando como le?o, buscando a quem tragar (I Pedro 5:8). Isto deixa claro que os espíritos de dem?nios andam as espreitas e observando a fim de colocar qualquer um no la?o. Por isso pode imitar falas, e revelar detalhes de alguém quem o médium nunca poderia saber por si só. No v15 o espírito querendo se passar por Samuel inquire ao angustiado Saul por causa dos filisteus e do silêncio de Deus. Olhe que por causa do seu aperto estava consultando ao espírito, mas é isso justificável aos olhos de Deus?<br>  <br>  Preste bem aten??o no v16 o que diz o espírito: “Por que, pois, a mim me perguntas, visto que o Senhor te desamparou e se fez teu inimigo?” O detalhe é que Deus n?o desampara ninguém, e também n?o se faz inimigo de ninguém. O espírito, portanto, mente, porque é o homem quem vira as costas para Deus e a Ele faz oposi??o com seus atos pecaminosos. Mas o detalhe é que o diabo costuma misturar verdade com mentira para arrastar a quem cair na sua lábia. No v17 o espírito diz o que já havia se confirmado desde o dia em que Deus determinou que Samuel ungisse um dos filhos de Jessé como Seu escolhido rei de Israel (I Samuel 16:1). E por que o Senhor fez isso? Porque Saul foi desobediente às palavras de Deus, proferidas através do profeta Samuel em muitas outras oportunidades. A partir daí foi só profetizando desgra?a como morte ao exército de Israel e mentira como a uni?o dos espíritos desses com o de Samuel (v18 a 20).<br>  <br>  Ent?o, como aquele espírito sabia que os homens de Saul seriam destro?ados em campo de batalhas? O inimigo sabe que quando a m?o de Deus n?o está presente a sua for?a é total e fatal. Como o Senhor Deus já n?o era mais com Saul e os filisteus era opositores dos israelitas, que vitória aquele rei poderia alcan?ar? Mas você pode perguntar: E Davi e seus homens? Davi e seus homens, os filisteus estavam considerando como aliados. Davi só estava fazendo isso para despistar o rei Saul, o seu perseguidor.<br>  <br>  Do v21 até o final do capítulo o que se ver é um ato de bondade da médium para com o rei perturbado e seus companheiros. Fico impressionado que pessoas que vivem a servi?o dos espíritos geralmente n?o é gente de má índole, e muitas n?o compreendem que desagradam profundamente a Deus com esse tipo de ofício.<br>  <br>  Vejamos porque daquele espírito que incorporou a médium e que se fez passar por Samuel n?o era o que parecia ser. Se é verdade o quê está escrito em Eclesiastes 9:5, 6 e 10, como pois, o espírito de Samuel sabia de alguma coisa? Outro detalhe é que os animais e feras da terra foram feitos “alma vivente” (Gênesis 1:24). Assim o Criador também fez o homem, com apenas um detalhe especial, animado pelo Seu próprio sopro (Gênesis 2:7). Expirando o f?lego do vivente,o espírito, esse volta a ser pó, porque do pó veio, e nenhuma diferen?a há na morte entre homens e animais (Eclesiastes 3:19). Mas, Deus foi poderoso e amável para criar o homem, também O será para recriá-lo na ressurrei??o (Apocalipse 20:5).<br>  <br>  A morte carnal é considerada na Bíblia como um sono (Jo?o 11:11 e 13). De acordo com o Salmo 146:4, na morte perecem os pensamentos. Enquanto persistir o atual estado de coisa os mortos n?o ser?o ressuscitados (Jó 14:12). Os mortos n?o louvam a Deus, nem os que descem à sepultura (Salmo 115:17). O que equivale dizer que n?o existe espírito ou entidade de homem vagando ou habitando em lugar nenhum deste planeta. O que existe por aí s?o anjos bons e maus. Esses sim, s?o os que possuem corpo espiritual, que consiste duma dimens?o diferente da física. Enquanto os anjos de Deus cumprem fielmente as determina??es de Cristo para benefício daqueles que h?o de obter a salva??o, já o inimigo de Deus arregimenta seu exército para enganar e destruir os seres humanos. Por isso, felizes s?o aqueles que se colocam graciosamente aos pés de Cristo Jesus, o Senhor.<br>  <br>  Que o Senhor Jesus seja a sua luz e completa alegria, hoje e sempre!|`|GkJqIkdVaa	Eliana.<br>  Sou espírita.<br>  Trabalho como voluntária há muitos anos em uma casa espírita.<br>  Sou médium, sou coordenadora de mediúnica, fa?o exposi??o doutrinária, passe, e atendimento fraterno.<br>  Pode me adicionar também, porque gostaria de trocar idéias com quem entende do assunto.<br>  <br>  xixa|`|QVgb9mazaa	quem acredita em espiritismo  em primeiro lugar é o diabo depois os dem?nios depois os espiritas e depois os espiritos imundos!!!|`|b4de1c10c370460f02ef6d6922865b9eaa	Eu acredito, o Espiritismo é uma doutrina alicer?ada em três princípios interdependentes: Filosofia, Ciência e Religi?o e tem como grande objetivo a nossa  melhoria e evolu??o.

Ele no-lo mostra, n?o mais como coisa sobrenatural, porém, ao contrário, como uma das for?as vivas e sem cessar atuantes da Natureza, como a fonte de uma imensidade de fen?menos até hoje incompreendidos e, por isso, relegados para o domino do fantástico e do maravilhoso. E a essas rela??es que o Cristo alude em muitas circunstancias e dai vem que muito do que ele disse permaneceu ininteligível ou falsamente interpretado. O Espiritismo é a chave com o auxilio da qual tudo se explica de modo fácil. <br>  S?o chegados os tempos em que se h?o de desenvolver as idéias, para que se realizem os progressos que est?o nos desígnios de Deus. Têm elas de seguir a mesma rota que percorreram as idéias de liberdade, suas precursoras. N?o se acredite, porém, que esse desenvolvimento se efetue sem lutas. N?o; aquelas idéias precisam, para atingirem a maturidade, de abalos e discuss?es, a fim de que atraiam a aten??o das massas. Uma vez isso conseguido, a beleza e a santidade da moral tocar?o os espíritos, que ent?o abra?ar?o uma ciência que lhes dá a chave da vida futura e descerra as portas da felicidade eterna.

KmsyO736aa	Olá Aguieira! Acredito que arrepender-se do que se deixou de fazer n?o seja o caminho para nossa felicidade. Aliás tenho um tema que sigo a risca: O passado já foi, o presente é agora e o amanh? será o reflexo do meu hoje. Veja só amigo, carregarmos insígnias do passado, somente tende a despertar em nós desejos negativos e sempre aquela velha pergunta/resposta: SE EU TIVESSE...<br>  <br>  Ora, amigo, todos somos protensos a equivocarmos em boa parte de nossas decis?es ao longo de nossa vida e a cada época;período temos algo que poderia ser realizado de uma forma diferenciada. Desta forma, é de suma importancia, voltar nossos olhares ao passado, como numa retrospectiva e avaliarmos certas atitudes por nós realizadas. Fazendo assim, é fácil retornar ao nosso cotidiano e procurar agora acertar mais, se podemos dizer assim. Aqueles equivocos... há devem ficar para trás e servir apenas como exemplo para o proseguimento da vida.<br>  <br>  Aliás, no presente, eu, você, nós, podemos fazer muita coisa! Fa?amos sem medo e tenhamos sempre a certeza de que se houver equívocos... tudo bem... farei novamente e acertarei. é isso aí amigo, fa?amos de nosso dia a dia uma descoberta e profundo ápice de nossos mais longiguos desejos. Abra?os.|`|44a4991265b075ad985222cf78c53abaaa	Aprendi a n?o arrepender-me de nada porque o passado n?o se reconstrói.<br>  <br>  O que fiz ou deixei de fazer tornou-me quem hoje sou e, se gosto de quem sou, devo ser grato aos erros e acertos, aos "fazeres" e n?o-fazeres" de toda a minha vida.<br>  <br>  Aprendi a n?o olhar para trás e apenas perceber com aten??o o presente, para errar menos no futuro.|`|472fecfbf3edc1411d903ca61997dc60aa	N?o ter assumido a minha sexualidade na minha festa de aspirantado, no quartel de artilharia no qual servi.

N?o tentaria ser t?o perfeito, relaxaria mais. Seria mais tolo ainda do que tenho sido, na verdade, bem poucas coisas levaria a sério. Seria menos higiênico. Correria mais riscos, viajaria mais, contemplaria mais entardeceres, subiria mais montanhas, nadaria mais rios. Iria a mais lugares aonde nunca fui, tomaria mais sorvete e menos lentilha, teria mais problemas reais e menos problemas imaginários. Eu fui uma dessas pessoas que viveu sensata e produtivamente cada minuto da vida: claro que tive momentos de alegria. Mas, se pudesse voltar a viver, trataria de ter somente bons momentos. Porque, se n?o sabem, disso é feita a vida, só de momentos, n?o perca o agora. Eu era um desses que nunca ia à parte alguma sem um term?metro, uma bolsa de água quente, um guarda-chuva e um pára-quedas; se voltasse a viver viajaria mais leve. Se eu pudesse voltar a viver, come?aria a andar descal?o no come?o da primavera e continuaria assim até o fim do outono. Daria mais voltas na minha rua, contemplaria mais amanheceres e brincaria com mais crian?as, se tivesse outra vez uma vida pela frente.

A Bíblia deveras menciona pessoas serem lan?adas no fogo. Mas, na Bíblia, s?o freqüentes os simbolismos. Assim, é esse fogo literal ou simbólico? E, se for simbólico, o que representa?<br>  <br>  à guisa de exemplo, Apocalipse (Revela??o), capítulo 20, versículo 15 (Vers?o Almeida), diz: “E aquele que n?o foi achado escrito no livro da vida foi lan?ado no lago de fogo.” Porém, o versículo 14  diz: “E a morte e o inferno foram lan?ados no lago de fogo.” N?o é estranho? Seria o próprio inferno atormentado? E como pode a morte, que é uma condi??o, ser lan?ada num fogo literal? O restante do versículo 14  diz: “Esta [o lago de fogo] é a segunda morte.” Apocalipse 21, versículo 8, repete este ponto. O que é esta “segunda morte”? A católica Bíblia de Jerusalém acrescenta a seguinte nota de rodapé (?; p. 1.625) sobre a “segunda morte”: “A morte eterna (20,6.-14). O fogo .?.?. [e a] água (v.6); um e outro s?o simbólicos.” Inteiramente verídico, pois significa a destrui??o completa, ou aniquilamento.<br>  <br>  Que interessante! O “inferno” vai ser destruído! Observe, contudo, que a palavra grega usada aqui é Hades, a qual, segundo a Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible (Concordancia Exaustiva da Bíblia), de Strong, significa “sepultura”. Est?o os mortos conscientes ou sofrendo no inferno, ou Hades? A Bíblia responde: “Os mortos n?o sabem mais nada .?.?. porque na sepultura [inferno, Douay, em inglês], para onde te precipitas, n?o haverá nem obra, nem raz?o, nem sabedoria, nem ciência.” —?Eclesiastes 9:5,?10, Matos Soares.<br>  <br>  Será que os mortos permanecem no Hades? N?o. O próprio Jesus estava no Hades, ou inferno, mas foi “ressuscitado no terceiro dia”, como ensinam tanto os credos eclesiásticos como a Bíblia. (1?Coríntios 15:4; Atos 2:29-32; Salmo 16:10) Também, por meio dele, “há de haver uma ressurrei??o tanto de justos como de injustos”. (Atos 24:15) Assim, o Hades será por fim esvaziado e deixará de existir — sendo ‘lan?ado no lago de fogo’.<br>  <br>  No entanto, alguns talvez perguntem: ‘Por que Revela??o, capítulo 20, versículo 10, diz que o Diabo será atormentado no lago de fogo?’ Se, como vimos, o lago de fogo é simbólico, ent?o, logicamente, o tormento também é.<br>  <br>  Nos tempos bíblicos, os carcereiros amiúde torturavam cruelmente seus prisioneiros, sendo por isso chamados de “atormentadores”. Em uma de suas ilustra??es, Jesus mencionou um escravo cruel como sendo ‘entregue aos carcereiros’ (em grego, ba·sa·ni·stés, termo que realmente significa “atormentadores”, e que também é assim traduzido em várias vers?es). (Mateus 18:34) Assim, quando Revela??o menciona o Diabo e outros serem “atormentados .?.?. para todo o sempre” no lago de fogo, isso significa que eles ser?o “encarcerados” por toda a eternidade na segunda morte da completa destrui??o. O Diabo, a morte herdada de Ad?o, e os iníquos impenitentes, s?o todos mencionados como sendo eternamente destruídos — “encarcerados” no lago de fogo. —?Compare com Hebreus 2:14; 1?Coríntios 15:26; Salmo 37:38.<br>  <br>  Avaliar os simbolismos bíblicos nos ajuda a entender o que Jesus queria dizer quando mencionou os pecadores serem ‘lan?ados no fogo do inferno; onde o seu bicho n?o morre, e o fogo nunca se apaga’. (Marcos 9:47, 48, Almeida) O termo grego aqui empregado, traduzido “fogo do inferno”, é gé·en·na, ou Geena. Um vale com esse nome achava-se situado logo nos limites de Jerusalém, e era usado como lixeira. Ali ardia uma fogueira, dia e noite, para destruir o lixo da cidade. Este, às vezes, incluía os cadáveres de criminosos considerados indignos de um enterro decente, ou de ressurrei??o. No vale também havia gusanos, como agentes destrutivos, mas estes por certo n?o eram imortais! Assim, Jesus simplesmente ilustrava, de forma vívida, dum modo bem entendido pelos habitantes da Judéia, que os iníquos impenitentes seriam destruídos eternamente. Destarte, a Geena possui o mesmo significado que “o lago de fogo” —?representa a segunda morte, com destrui??o eterna.<br>  <br>  O dogma do tormento eterno baseia-se na teoria da alma imortal. No entanto, a Bíblia declara meridianamente: “A alma que pecar — ela é que morrerá.” (Ezequiel 18:4, 20; veja também Atos 3:23.) Proclamadores do inferno de fogo têm feito com que Jeová, o Deus verdadeiro, pare?a um perverso — um monstro cruel — em vez daquilo que Ele é: um Deus de amor, “misericordioso e clemente .?.?. abundante em benevolência”. —?êxodo 34:6.<br>  <br>  Amorosamente, Deus proveu a salva??o dos homens, n?o do tormento, mas de serem destruídos. Disse Jesus: “Deus amou tanto o mundo, que deu o seu Filho unigênito, a fim de que todo aquele que nele exercer fé n?o seja destruído, mas tenha vida eterna.” —?Jo?o 3:16.|`|cETksEZlaa	Converter do que para quê?<br>  N?o existe melhor convers?o do que a que permita a luz tomar conta da treva e, nada é para sempre.<br>  Quanto a tomada onde ligar a luz, tanto faz, desde que tenha energia para isso.<br>  Paz e Luz!|`|d1b6c9236387ff4f7ab132d2801cda5faa	Me converte em que????

Você acha que desenvolveu a verdadeira fé ? Aquela que Jesus dizia ? Ent?o vejamos: Quando você tem pela frente, uma situa??o complicada, um caso de saúde ou financeiro de solu??o complexa, de que forma você costuma buscar uma solu??o ? Você se entrega ao desespero, ao sofrimento e à dor, à preocupa??o excessiva ? Você termina seu dia como se estivesse entrado realmente numa batalha violenta pela sobrevivência ? Com o corpo dolorido, exausto, ferido por dentro ? Seu dia seguinte é igual a um holocausto nuclear onde você tem medo de abrir a porta e ver que nada mais existe lá fora ? Você geralmente adora a Deus pedindo uma solu??o para o seu problema ? Você ora fervorosamente pedindo a cura ? Ou pedindo a solu??o do problema, seja ele qual for ? Nessas preces você realmente acredita que haverá cura ? Você faz visualiza??es de uma situa??o de cura ? Em qualquer nível ? Se você adota essas posturas em rela??o ao dia, ent?o, infelizmente você n?o é uma pessoa de fé. N?o pratica a fé verdadeira ensinada pelo Mestre Jesus.<br>  Ao se entregar à dor e ao sofrimento, às preocupa??es excessivas, você simplesmente está renegando sua conex?o cósmica com Deus. Da mesma forma, se você ora fervorosamente pedindo a cura da situa??o, nesse caso também está negando sua conex?o cósmica com Deus. Isso acontece, porque existe uma parte desse processo chamado de Pensamento Dominante e que você nunca percebeu. Ent?o quando você ora pedindo a cura, por trás desse pedido existe a afirma??o e o reconhecimento da doen?a. Quanto mais fervoroso é o pedido mais o seu potencial emocional está focado na doen?a, aceitando-a, validando-a. Note que nesse caso, o que existe realmente é a nega??o da trindade Alma-Mente-Corpo. Você nega ter sido criado à Imagem e Semelhan?a de Deus. N?o entende que, sendo imagem e semelhan?a de Deus, já é perfeito e dotado de poder e que sua vida já está curada de todos os males. N?o percebe que a sua desconex?o com Deus é que gera a ilus?o de separa??o e, por conseqüência, todos os problemas que você enfrenta.<br>  Quando falamos de fé verdadeira preconizada por Jesus ; Aquela fé do tamanho de um gr?o de mostarda, mas que remove montanhas, estamos falando de certeza absoluta da conex?o cósmica com Deus. Se você realmente acredita e aceita que foi criado à Imagem e Semelhan?a de Deus, ent?o n?o haverá lugar para dúvidas de nenhuma espécie. Também n?o haverá a canaliza??o do seu potencial emocional para o problema.<br>  Nem haverá o pedido de cura porque na sua certeza de conex?o com Deus já estará implícita a cura e o socorro. Ou seja, na fé verdadeira n?o há o reconhecimento da doen?a ou do problema e sim, a gratid?o total e absoluta pela conex?o com Deus. E essa gratid?o será o verdadeiro milagre na sua vida. Você n?o pedirá a cura nem o socorro porque passará a SER a cura . Sim, você será a cura e o socorro e onde você tocar, a conex?o com Deus estará presente.<br>  Também n?o esque?a que você é a Imagem e Semelhan?a de Deus e nada pode mudar isso. Ent?o, tudo o que você afirmar a seu próprio respeito também estará afirmando sobre Deus de quem você é a Imagem e Semelhan?a.<br>  Se você se define pecador miserável, imperfeito, estará afirmando a mesma coisa de seu criador porque você é Imagem e Semelhan?a. No mínimo estará reconhecendo e afirmando cosmicamente, que Deus poderia ter criado algo miserável, pecador e imperfeito. Ent?o, reconhe?a e aceite que você, Imagem e Semelhan?a de Deus, é perfeito, puro, saudável e Divino. E mais, que você tem um grande poder pessoal criador através dos seus pensamentos e afirma??es. Reconhe?a que a sua ignorancia atual ou, a ilus?o de separa??o do todo é que causa todos os equívocos no seu caminho. Que o fato de pensar que está separado de Deus e do todo, é o único responsável pela Qualidade Ruim das suas cria??es mentais e das materializa??es medíocres em sua vida. Sendo efetivamente a Imagem e Semelhan?a de Deus coloca você verdadeiramente dentro do contexto do Todo. Você está em Deus assim como Deus está em você. E com esse poder nas m?os, você pode ser a cura ou a doen?a, o bem ou o mal, a paz ou a guerra, a vida ou a morte.<br>  Nunca houve e nem haverá uma for?a externa a você, capaz de arrastá-lo para o lodo sem que haja a sua DECIS?O, consciente ou inconsciente de seguir esse caminho. Nem o bem e nem o mal o atingir?o como impacto externo. Sua decis?o o fará ir até esses extremos. Você é quem atinge o bem ou o mal, com a impress?o ilusória de que foi atingido. Assim, se despertar sua consciência cósmica para sua conex?o com Deus, tornar-se-á um com Ele e n?o precisará mais dos milagres de Deus, pois sendo UM COM O PAI, você mesmo SERá O MILAGRE.<br>  PENSE NISSO / PAZ PROFUNDA.|`|pCkgtv9naa	Olá...<br>  <br>  Deus joga "O JOGO DA VIDA" e "BANCO IMOBILIARIO"<br>  <br>  T+, abra?o...|`|AA12005596	Um cientista famoso falou que Deus n?o joga dados... outro disse que Deus n?o só joga dados como os esconde.

Je pense que les mythes ont contribué à aider l'hoomme à comprendre les mystères qui l'entouraient. La science a démonté la génèse, elle a détruit beaucoup de conceptions fausses érigées en vérité par les églises ou les religions. Par contre il y a des réalités troublantes qui laissent encorela possibilité d'un ou plusieurs dieux. Ainsi la physique quantique va très loin dans le petit, elle est parvenue même à montré que la micro particule a des comportements de matière comme de lumière. Au bout de son analyse il lui est apparu comme possible que derrière le plus petit élément de matière alors qu'il est sensé ne plus rien exister il se pourrait qu'il y ait comme une sorte de conscience, la pensée peut-être avant l'objet ou la vie, pourquoi pas Dieu blotti dans son infiniment petite maison. Bonsoir et pardonne mon délire auquel je crois un peu mais que j'ai bien du mal à expliquer. Faut dire qu'il est tard.|`|b7c65878e9594bbdf565fd903892c067aa	La Bible dit qu'Adam et Eve eurent des fils et des filles. Alors oui, ils ont d? se marier entre frères et soeurs. Mais comme ils étaient plus proches de la perfection que nous après des millénaires de dégénérescence, on peut décemment supposer que la consanguinité ne représentait pas le problème qu'elle pose maintenant. Donc au tout début de l'humanité c'était logiquement, et obligatoirement, permis. Ensuite Dieu l'a interdit, mais c'est depuis tellement longtemps que c'est rentré dans les moeurs et que ?a nous semble moralement impossible.<br>  <br>  Adam était un homme, au cas où tu saurais pas... ;-)<br>  Et pour info, à sa ressemblance, ?a veut dire sur le plan mental, affectif, émotionnel...pas physique car Dieu n'est pas matériel.<br>  <br>  Mais, tout aussi respectueusement, je ne vois pas en quoi ce genre de questions peut remettre en cause l'existence d'un créateur. :-s|`|c436ed9fe75142e5d75538d888a270e9aa	Tu parles d'image dans ton explication...<br>  reprenons alors l'histoire d'Adam et Eve qui est une fa?on imagée et non historique d'expliquer le rapport homme - femme, et non une réalité à prendre à la lettre.<br>  C'est une fa?on de conduire une réflexion théologique de l'amour et la force de vie qu'une femme peut exercer chez un homme, avec la nuance que celle-ci est aussi considérée comme celle capable de faire fléchir un homme, comme de le fortifier.<br>  La pomme n'est qu'un symbole, bien s?r, et il ne serait pas judicieux de considérer Eve comme celle qui a provoqué le mal...<br>  <br>  La Bible n'est pas considérée comme une vérité scientifique ou historique... ouf.... et ceux qui la considèrent come telle commettent une erreur prompte à plonger l'humanité dans ses cendres.<br>  J'ai beaucoup apprécié ta question et aimé y répondre...!!<br>  bravo|`|0c74e92505751984da63a42ff02c0205aa	Je ne trouve pas ta question bête, au contraire, faudrait peut-être reflechir à ces énormités présentes dans les textes sacrés : je viens de voir à la tv que certains chrétiens extremistes ne pouvant nier l'existence des dinosaures mais soutenant , comme dans la bible, que l'humanité n'a que 6000 ans, en ont conclu que les hommes cohabitaient avec les dinosaures....mais bien s?r...

L'Adam et Eve sont une allégorie de la naissance de l'humanité. La grande majorité des chrétiens et des juifs ne croient pas en Adam et Eve dont nous serions issus. C'est idiot, ?a ne tiens pas debout. Maintenant, ces allégories, ces images qui nous sont données par la Bible, qu'elles sont leur explication ? qu'elles sont leur enseignement ? ?a c'est un autre débat. Personnellement je n'ai pas de réponse et je ne comprends pas la signification du péché originel.<br>  <br>  2/  Dieu à fait l'homme à son image. Là encore tu tombes dans le travers d'une lecture au premier degré. Dieu n'ayant pas de corps, n'étant pas matière car étant en dehors de l’espace-temps dans lequel nous sommes prisonniers, sa représentation avec une forme humano?de est totalement idiote. La représentation de Dieu dessiné sous les traits d'un homme est une simplification dont les auteurs sont des êtres humains. D'ailleurs, seuls les catholiques représentent Dieu. Les protestants, les juifs et les musulmans ne le représentent pas, partant du postulat qu'on ne représente pas ce qui ne peut pas être représenté.<br>  Donc croire en Dieu ne veut pas dire qu'on imagine Dieu comme étant un beau et sage vieillard aux longs cheveux et à la barbe blanche assis sur un nuage.<br>  <br>  Pourquoi je crois en Dieu et qu'elle est ma conception de Dieu :<br>  <br>  Mon idée sur cette question est que si Dieu n'existe pas, on doit lui opposer le hasard (le fameux hasard des athées).<br>  Ce hasard serait à l’origine de la création de l'univers au moment du BigBang. Ce même hasard, sur la planète terre et peut-être ailleurs, aurait engendré la vie (sans aucune volonté créatrice) à partir d'une matière totalement inerte, stérile et sans aucune intelligence. Enfin, cette vie se serait développée jusqu'à donner des êtres d'une complexité incroyable (et dont on ne comprend que très peu de chose encore aujourd’hui). Tout ceci avec la marque de l'évolution, du progrès. Et d'ailleurs, cette non intelligence primitive aurait engendré l'intelligence (et la connerie des hommes dans le même temps).<br>  Donc s’il n'y a pas une "Intelligence" qui a présidé à cette création, à cette évolution, à ce progrès, c'est que le hasard fait sacrément bien les choses.<br>  <br>  Non ! Pour moi, le progrès (compris dans le sens de l'évolution qui va du chaos primitif à la réalisation d'êtres vivants infiniment complexes) est la marque de Dieu.<br>  <br>  Maintenant, je me répète, Dieu pour moi n'est pas un vieil homme aux cheveux et à la barbe blanche assis sur un nuage. Dieu, je ne me le représente pas car Il dépasse ce que notre cerveau humain peut comprendre et se représenter. J’en ai l'intuition, c'est tout.<br>  <br>  Une démonstration facile que le hasard ne créé pas l’ordre et ne construit pas :<br>  Imagines que dans une boite tu alignes 64 pièces de bois carrées, 32 blanches et 32 noires, de fa?on à réaliser un damier. Tu secoues ta boite, le damier disparait. Tu pourras secouer la boite jusqu’à la nuit des temps, tu ne retrouveras jamais ton damier d’origine. L’unique fa?on de le reconstruire, de le recopier ailleurs, sera le fait d’une volonté et d’une intelligence. Et la construction du monde qui nous entoure est bien évidement infiniment plus complexe que la réalisation d’un simple damier.<br>  <br>  Pour finir, il y a des gens qui vont à la messe sans même se poser de question sur la nature de Dieu, le pourquoi de notre existence, etc…Ils y vont parce qu’ils sont issus de familles chrétiennes pratiquantes, et que c’est dans la tradition, dans l’ordre des choses de croire en Dieu, d’aller à la messe (ce que je dis pour les chrétiens est tout aussi valable pour les musulmans et les juifs). Pour ma part, je n’y vais que très rarement. Je ne trouve pas dans le discours des prêtes des réponses à mes questions. Les curés ne font pas de la théologie, ils font de la morale. Quant au caractère sacré de la messe, de l’acte de prier, de communier, il a complètement disparu.<br>  <br>  En résumé, croire en Dieu pour moi ne relève pas de la démarche ou du positionnement sociale et culturelle. C’est un sentiment personnel, une intuition très forte, et l’origine de ma croyance est davantage une construction logique qu’une foi aveugle. Enfin, je suis chrétien car je crois en Jésus Christ. Je crois qu’Il a effectivement eu une mission divine, qu’il est mort sur la croix et qu’Il est ressuscité (ceci-dit, je rejette certain dogmes de l’Eglise de Rome, tels que l’Immaculée conception et autres bêtises du même tonneau).<br>  <br>  J’ai été un peu long. Mais la question est sérieuse, la réponse doit l’être également.<br>  <br>  Luc.|`|1cfaef01c44fba64a493dfe8ddc58c98aa	Cela restera un échange d'idée entre des êtres humains, sachez qu'on ne per?ois les choses qu'à une échelle à notre dimension, l'échelle divine reste et restera toujours inaccessible.|`|1f6d4fcf0af4b58711bc17d925ba3fc0aa	Il est dit dans la Bible: QUE CEUX QUI VEULENT COMPRENDRE, COMPRENDRONT"<br>  Pour moi c est trés clair! ta question, et surtout ton dévellopement en dessous, prouve que tu n a pas chercher a comprendre!!!<br>  Je suis sur meme que tu n a jamais ouvert la Bible de ta propre initiative?<br>  -Ton jugement n est basé que sur se que d autre ignorant, et d ailleur surement athé, ton dit sur la bible...<br>  Je trouve ca trés peu digne d une personne ayant un cerveau!!!c est dommage car si tu avais lus sérieusement la Bible tu ne sortirai pas c bétise ou  alors tu est trop jeune ou trop...|`|34998cec066d2a4f9d48a4d95dafff44aa	Dieu existe bel et bien du moment que logiquement il n'y a pas de création sans créateur. regarde toi dans quel état magnifique tu es et regarde l'univers qui nous entoure comment il tourne avec justesse et précision. ca devrait t'éviter de perdre du temps en niant   <br>  l'existence de Dieu. et en plus la reproduction au début de l'humanité exigeait à ce que les frères et soeurs se mariaient.<br>  J'aime moi même discuter religion et je me permets de te donner mon E-mail si tu veux qu'on en discute amplement:  hm79475@yahoo.fr|`|3e41d0748aadd1f7704541c12558890eaa	tu as l air de considerer que croire en dieu, ca veut dire croire en l ancien testament. la religion ne se limite pas qu a la bible, qui a été imposer aux pauvres simples d esprit par des faux prophetes qui etaient en fait des manipulateurs vicieux (genre mohammed qui a utilisé sa fausse religion pour expliquer ses penchants pedophiles, puisque rappelons qu il a forcé au mariage et a violé aisha, une gamine de 6 ansquand il en avait 50).    de nombreuses personne sont croyantes, mais elles ne sinspirent pas de livres ecrit il y a 2000 ans, par exemple les bouddhistes sont bcp plus coherants dans leur raisonnement que les musulmans qui n ont aucun sens logique.|`|6e7f15b00e14a7d6931083a9dcfc0f04aa	tu devrais lire les livres saints, et t'aprofondir dans les idées qu'elles portent, non pas les feuillter, et les juger sans aucune analyse, et j'espere qu'un jour la lumiere de la foi eclairera ton esprit et purifira ton ame|`|871a22c213227227beb573eed150c9e8aa	si Dieu éxiste : j'ai marché dedans mais du pied gauche ?a porte bonheure!|`|9848181998355d42a94d5fa6cea5074caa	Ne fais pas dire à la Bible ce qu'elle ne dit pas.

Só cabia a mim respeitá-lo até pelos seus cabelos branquinhos de octogenário. Era como um indivíduo que vivesse num universo de duas dimens?es, comprimento e largura. Tal qual uma folha de papel, que n?o tem espa?o para outra dimens?o.<br>  <br>  Recordo-me também que um professor de física ao ensinar dimens?es fez um círculo, colocou um ponto no centro e perguntou: Como um ser no centro do círculo, tra?ado a compasso, poderia sair deste círculo sem tocar em nenhum dos pontos tra?ados? Como ninguém se atreveu a responder, disse-nos que saltando por cima usando a 3a dimens?o conhecida: a altura.<br>  <br>  Hoje, fala-se em outras dimens?es no universo. Buracos negros, passagens de uma dimens?o à outra, mudan?a de tempo, e etc. As pesquisas científicas que investigam novas dimens?es trazem-nos surpresas a cada dia. Mas há quem se recuse a crer nelas. Como “seu” Euclides...<br>  <br>  O Dr Raymond Mood Jr. pesquisou mais de 150 pacientes que passaram pela experiência de saída fora do corpo (ou “Out of body experience”), para a 4a dimens?o. Pacientes que foram dados como mortos mas, por massagem cardíaca e outros processos voltaram a vida e narraram o que viram e sentiram.<br>  <br>  Contam que se sentiram fora do corpo físico, isto é, enxergaram seu corpo na maca, olhando em cima. Sentiram que seu eu ou sua individualidade estava pairando no ar e observando seu corpo lá em baixo. Assistem, admirados, as tentativas de ressuscita??o de um corpo que descobrem ser o seu próprio. Sentem-se movendo por uma espécie de túnel ou passagem e escutam sons que n?o conseguem definir.<br>  <br>  Observam cores estranhas no novo meio que os cerca. Ouvem, incrédulos, seus médicos declará-los mortos. Contemplam, pasmos, seu novo corpo mais leve e sutil: o corpo espiritual. Sentem-se emocionalmente perturbados e dizem (ao voltar) que estiveram em algo ou algum lugar como se fosse uma 4a dimens?o. Alucina??o? Efeito de drogas? Anóxia cerebral? A??o de anestésicos?<br>  <br>  Descrevem, ainda, ver sorrindo a sua volta, em gestos amigos, ex-parentes e companheiros que já haviam morrido!<br>  <br>  Súbito, percebem estar inundados de sentimentos de alegria e paz.<br>  <br>  Mentalmente recapitulam, por um processo que n?o conseguem definir, toda a sua vida em seus pontos capitais. Vêem, como a desfilar em um filme tridimensional, imagens de sua infancia, juventude e idade madura. O processo é interrompido bruscamente e o indivíduo se vê de volta ao seu corpo.<br>  <br>  “Eu estava lá em cima no teto, vendo-os trabalhar em mim. Quando puseram os eletrodos no meu peito, e meu corpo sacudiu caí de volta nele. Como se fosse um peso morto. Dei por mim novamente em meu corpo...”<br>  <br>  A principal hipótese a ser considerada ao examinarmos este relatos, é sem dúvida a inverdade. No entanto, crer que adultos maduros, emocionalmente estáveis que choram, emocionados ao contarem estes eventos ocorridos até há 30 anos, estejam mentindo todos juntos, contando exatamente a mesma mentira, é realmente uma proeza.<br>  <br>  Assim, crer que um veterinário do sul dos Estados Unidos, uma simpática velhinha da fronteira canadense, um pipoqueiro da Califórnia, e assim por diante, até 150 pessoas de locais distantes tenham se reunido e conspirado durante 30 anos de pesquisa para contarem, em detalhes, a mesma mentira, n?o é admissível.<br>  <br>  Admitir que o passado religioso das pessoas houvesse lhes influenciado na elabora??o de suas histórias (mentira inconsciente ) , também é pouco provável. Nenhuma delas falou em céu ou inferno. O conteúdo das informa??es n?o difere entre os que informam n?o ter nenhuma cren?a em rela??o a daqueles que se dizem religiosos.<br>  <br>  A explica??o do fen?meno pela influência de drogas ou medicamentos, a princípio plausível, fica cada vez mais difícil de se aceitar. Em muitos casos, o fato de ver-se fora do corpo ocorreu em acidentes de transito sem administra??o de qualquer droga. Quando ocorrido em hospital, as drogas variam desde a aspirina, passando por adrenalina, até anestésicos locais e gasosos. N?o há diferen?a nos relatos feitos por aqueles que sofreram medica??o de vários tipos.<br>  <br>  A hipótese de alucina??o ou ilus?o possui dois fatores que pesam contra.<br>  <br>  Em primeiro lugar verificamos a grande semelhan?a de conteúdo que encontramos entre as descri??es. Em segundo lugar as pessoas que passam pela experiência s?o gente normal, emocionalmente estáveis, alguns médicos e outros profissionais extremamente sérios e equilibrados.<br>  <br>  Resta ainda a penúltima hipótese que é a anóxia cerebral, isto é, a deficiência de oxigênio que levaria a todos terem uma experiência comum. O que nos leva a descrer desta possibilidade, é o fato de que, em muitos casos, a saída fora do corpo os pacientes a tiveram antes do stress corporal ou fisiológico, que lhe causaria a anóxia.<br>  <br>  Em alguns casos n?o houve qualquer injúria física que possa ter levado a uma deficiência de oxigênio cerebral. Além do mais, n?o foram encontrados, após a experiência, nenhum sinal de dano neurológico nestes pacientes, o que ocorreria em situa??es de anoxia cerebral.<br>  <br>  Ficamos com a hipótese espírita. Cremos na vida após a morte. Dizemos até mais, n?o cremos na morte. Parece-nos mais plausível dizer que há vida, após a vida. Vida em outra dimens?o da realidade. Contra estes estudos, antep?em-se dois preconceitos: o primeiro é o preconceito religioso, pois alguns religiosos mais conservadores ficam perturbados por quem quer que ouse pesquisar uma área supostamente tabu. Seria uma área “sagrada”.<br>  <br>  Acham, alguns, que a quest?o da vida após a morte deve permanecer uma quest?o de fé cega, n?o posta em dúvida por ninguém. N?o seria este um pensamento medieval?<br>  <br>  O segundo preconceito é o preconceito científico, manifestado por alguns médicos pois classificam estes estudos como algo “n?o científico”. Penso que somos capazes n?o só de conquistar os espa?os siderais mas também de descobrir a nossa própria natureza.<br>  <br>  Esta postura de nossos colegas de ciência estimula minha criatividade, vou patentear um neologismo: postura avestruriforme. Lembra-nos a posi??o de uma grande ave que é ciente de suas dimens?es avantajadas mas sua grandeza a impede de voar, o avestruz. Além de estar impedida de al?ar v?o, pela excessiva grandeza, quando se vê amea?ada e n?o encontra saída, coloca sua cabe?a em um buraco como se dissesse: “n?o quero nem olhar , o que vou ver n?o consigo aceitar”... <br>  <br>  Prefiro conversar como “seu” Euclides...<br>  <br>  E-mail: ricardo.di.bernardi@terra.com.br|`|65c0760d3571c340f3da599574bd64a5aa	N?o, rafa, vamos para o Umbral.

Podemos ver claramente que n?o pode haver vida após á morte. <br>  <br>  Daniel 12:2 “E muitos dos que dormem no pó da terra ressuscitar?o, uns para a vida eterna, e outros para vergonha e desprezo eterno.” Portanto os mortos em Cristo, ou seja, que entregaram suas vidas á Deus e guardaram seus mandamentos inclusive o sábado, ouvir?o á voz de Jesus no dia de sua vinda á esta terra e ir?o despertar da morte para junto com os santos vivos encontrá-Lo nas nuvens do céu.<br>  <br>  Você morre salvo ou perdido para sempre, n?o há uma segunda chance.

041e6252efb55962f9628b5aef9cc230aa	BIOGRAFIA DE ALLAN KARDEC<br>  ALLAN KARDEC<br>  <br>  Hyppolyte Leon Denizard Rivail (Allan Kardec), nasceu em 3 de outubro de 1804, em Lion, Fran?a. Ele era filho de um juiz, Jean Baptiste-Antoine Rivail, e sua m?e chamava-se Jeanne Louise Duhamel.<br>  <br>  O professor Rivail fez em Lion os seus primeiros estudos e completou em seguida a sua bagagem escolar, em Yverdun (Suí?a), com o célebre professor Pestalozzi, de quem cedo se tornou um dos mais eminentes discípulos, colaborador inteligente e dedicado. Aplicou-se, de todo o cora??o, à propaganda do sistema de educa??o que exerceu t?o grande influência sobre a reforma dos estudos na Fran?a e na Alemanha. Muitíssimas vezes, quando Pestalozzi era chamado pelos governos, para fundar institutos semelhantes ao de<br>  Yverdun, confiava a Denizard Rivail o encargo de o substituir na dire??o da sua escola. Lingüista insigne, conhecia a fundo e falava corretamente o alem?o, o inglês, o italiano e o espanhol; conhecia também o holandês, e podia facilmente exprimir-se nesta língua. Membro de várias sociedades sábias, notadamente da Academia Real de Arras, foi autor de numerosas obras de educa??o, dentre as quais podemos citar:<br>  <br>  - Plano Proposto para o Melhoramento da Instru??o Pública (1828);<br>  - Curso Teórico e Prático de Aritmética, segundo o método Pestalozzi, para uso dos professores e m?es de família (1829);<br>  - Gramática Francesa Clássica (1831);<br>  - Manual para Exames de Capacidade ; Solu??es Racionais de Quest?es e problemas de Aritmética e Geometria (1846);<br>  - Catecismo Gramatical da Língua Francesa (1848);<br>  - Programas de cursos Ordinários de Física, Química, Astronomia e Fisiologia, que professava no Liceu Polimático; Ditados normais dos exames da Prefeitura e da Sorbone, acompanhados de Ditados especiais sobre as dificuldades ortográficas (1849).<br>  <br>  Além das obras didáticas, Rivail também fazia contabilidade de casas comerciais, passando ent?o a ter uma vida tranqüila em termos monetários. Seu nome era conhecido e respeitado e muitas de suas obras foram adotadas pela Universidade de Fran?a. No mundo literário, conhece a culta professora Amélia Gabrielle Boudet, com quem contrai matrim?nio, no dia 6 de fevereiro de 1832.<br>  <br>  Em 1854, através de um amigo chamado Fortier, o professor Denizard ouve falar pela primeira vez sobre os fen?menos das mesas girantes, em moda nos sal?es europeus, desde a explos?o dos fen?menos espíritas em 1848, na cidadezinha de Hydesville nos Estados Unidos, com as irm?s Fox. No ano seguinte, se interessou mais pelo assunto, pois soube tratar-se de interven??o dos Espíritos, informa??o dada pelo sr. Carlotti, seu amigo há 25 anos. Depois de algum tempo, em maio de 1855, ele foi convidado para participar de uma dessas reuni?es, pelo Sr. Patier, um homem muito sério e instruído. O professor era um grande estudioso do magnetismo e aceitou participar, pensando tratar-se de fen?menos ligados ao assunto. Após algumas sess?es, come?ou a questionar para descobrir uma resposta lógica que pudesse explicar o fato de objetos inertes emitirem mensagens inteligentes. Admirava-se com as manifesta??es, pois parecia-lhe que por detrás delas havia uma causa inteligente responsável pelos movimentos. Resolveu investigar, pois desconfiou que atrás daqueles fen?menos estava como que a revela??o de uma nova lei.<br>  <br>  As "for?as invisíveis" que se manifestavam nas sess?es de mesas falantes diziam que eram as almas de homens que já haviam vivido na Terra. O Codificador intrigava-se mais e mais. Num desses trabalhos, uma mensagem foi destinada especificamente a ele. Um Espírito chamado Verdade disse-lhe que tinha uma importante miss?o a desenvolver. Daria vida a uma nova doutrina filosófica, científica e religiosa. Kardec afirmou que n?o se achava um homem digno de uma tarefa de tal envergadura, mas que sendo o escolhido, tudo faria para desempenhar com sucesso as obriga??es de que fora incumbido.<br>  <br>  Allan Kardec iniciou sua observa??o e estudo dos fen?menos espíritas, com o entusiasmo próprio das criaturas amadurecidas e racionais, mas sua primeira atitude é a de ceticismo: "Eu crerei quando vir, e quando conseguirem provar-me que uma mesa disp?e de cérebro e nervos, e que pode se tornar sonambula; até que isso se dê, dêem-me a permiss?o de n?o enxergar nisso mais que um conto para provocar o sono".<br>  <br>  Depois da estranheza e da descren?a inicial, Rivail come?a a cogitar seriamente na validade de tais fen?menos e continua em seus estudos e observa??es, mais e mais convencido da seriedade do que estava presenciando. Eis o que ele nos relata: "De repente encontrava-me no meio de um fato esdrúxulo, contrário, à primeira vista, às leis da natureza, ocorrendo em presen?a de pessoas honradas e dignas de fé. Mas a idéia de uma mesa falante ainda n?o cabia em minha mente".<br>  <br>  O desenvolvimento da Codifica??o Espírita basicamente teve início na residência da família Baudin, no ano de 1855. Na casa havia duas mo?as que eram médiuns. Tratava-se de Julie e Caroline Baudin, de 14 e 16 anos, respectivamente. Através da "cesta-pi?o", um mecanismo parecido com as mesas girantes, Kardec fazia perguntas aos Espíritos desencarnados, que as respondiam por meio da escrita mediúnica. à medida que as perguntas do professor iam sendo respondidas, ele percebia que ali se desenhava o corpo de uma doutrina e se preparou para publicar o que mais tarde se transformou na primeira obra da Codifica??o Espírita.<br>  <br>  A forma pela qual os Espíritos se comunicavam no princípio era através da cesta-pi?o que tinha um lápis em seu centro. As m?os das médiuns eram colocadas nas bordas, de forma que os movimentos involuntários, provocados pelos Espíritos, produzissem a escrita. Com o tempo, a cesta foi substituída pelas m?os dos médiuns, dando origem à conhecida psicografia. Das consultas feitas aos Espíritos, nasceu "O Livro dos Espíritos", lan?ado em 18 de abril de 1857, descortinando para o mundo todo um horizonte de possibilidades no campo do conhecimento.<br>  <br>  A partir daí, Allan Kardec dedicou-se intensivamente ao trabalho de expans?o e divulga??o da Boa Nova. Viajou 693 léguas, visitou vinte cidades e assistiu mais de 50 reuni?es doutrinárias de Espiritismo.<br>  <br>  Pelo seu profundo e inexcedível amor ao bem e à verdade, Allan Kardec edificou para todo o sempre o maior monumento de sabedoria que a Humanidade poderia ambicionar, desvendando os grandes mistérios da vida, do destino e da dor, pela compreens?o racional e positiva das múltiplas existências, tudo à luz meridiana dos postulados do Cristianismo.<br>  <br>  Filho de pais católicos, Allan Kardec foi criado no Protestantismo, mas n?o abra?ou nenhuma dessas religi?es, preferindo situar-se na posi??o de livre pensador e homem de análise. Compungia-lhe a rigidez do dogma que o afastava das concep??es religiosas. O excessivo simbolismo das teologias e ortodoxias, tornava-o incompatível com os princípios da fé cega.<br>  <br>  Situado nessa posi??o, em face de uma vida intelectual absorvente, foi o homem de pondera??o, de caráter ilibado e de saber profundo, despertado para o exame das manifesta??es das chamadas mesas girantes. A esse tempo o mundo estava voltado, em sua curiosidade, para os inúmeros fatos psíquicos que, por toda a parte, se registravam e que, pouco depois, culminaram no advento da altamente consoladora doutrina que recebeu o nome de Espiritismo, tendo como seu codificador, o educador emérito e imortal de Lyon.<br>  <br>  O Espiritismo n?o era, entretanto, cria??o do homem e sim uma revela??o divina à Humanidade para a defesa dos postulados legados pelo Rabi da Galiléia, numa quadra em que o materialismo avassalador conquistava as mais brilhantes inteligências e os cérebros proeminentes da Europa e das Américas.<br>  <br>  A codifica??o da Doutrina Espírita colocou Kardec na galeria dos grandes missionários e benfeitores da Humanidade. A sua obra é um acontecimento t?o extraordinário como a Revolu??o Francesa. Esta estabeleceu os direitos do homem dentro da sociedade, aquela instituiu os liames do homem com o universo, deu-lhe as chaves dos mistérios que assoberbavam os homens, dentre eles o problema da chamada morte, os quais até ent?o n?o haviam sido equacionados pelas religi?es. A miss?o do mestre, como havia sido prognosticada pelo Espírito de Verdade, era de escolhos e perigos, pois ela n?o seria apenas de codificar, mas principalmente de abalar e transformar a Humanidade. A miss?o foi-lhe t?o árdua que, em nota de 1o. de janeiro de 1867, Kardec referia-se as ingratid?es de amigos, a ódios de inimigos, a injúrias e a calúnias de elementos fanatizados. Entretanto, ele jamais esmoreceu diante da tarefa.<br>  <br>  O seu pseud?nimo, Allan Kardec, tem a seguinte origem: Uma noite, o Espírito que se autodenominava Z, deu-lhe, por um médium, uma comunica??o toda pessoal, na qual lhe dizia, entre outras coisas, tê-lo conhecido em uma precedente existência, quando, ao tempo dos Druidas, viviam juntos nas Gálias. Ele se chamava, ent?o, Allan Kardec, e, como a amizade que lhe havia votado só fazia aumentar, prometia-lhe esse Espírito secundá-lo na tarefa muito importante a que ele era chamado, e que facilmente levaria a termo. No momento de publicar o Livro dos Espíritos, o autor ficou muito embara?ado em resolver como o assinaria, se com o seu nome -Denizard-Hippolyte-Léon Rivail, ou com um pseud?nimo. Sendo o seu nome muito conhecido do mundo científico, em virtude dos seus trabalhos anteriores, e podendo originar uma confus?o, talvez mesmo prejudicar o êxito do empreendimento, ele adotou o alvitre de o assinar com o nome de Allan Kardec, pseud?nimo que adotou definitivamente.<br>  <br>  Livros que escreveu :<br>  <br>  O Livro dos Espíritos (1857)<br>  O que é o Espiritismo (1959)<br>  O Livro dos Médiuns (1861)<br>  O Evangelho Segundo o Espiritismo (1864)<br>  O Céu e o Inferno (1865)<br>  A Gênese (1868)<br>  Obras Póstumas (1890)<br>  <br>  Em 1o de Janeiro de 1858 o missionário lionês publicou o primeiro número da Revista Espírita, que serviu como poderoso auxiliar para o desenvolvimento de seus trabalhos, trabalho que desenvolveu sem interrup??o por 12 anos, até sua morte. Deve figurar na sua rela??o de obras, n?o só por ter estado sob sua dire??o até 1869, como também porque as suas páginas expressam o pensamento e a a??o do Codificador do Espiritismo.<br>  <br>  Em 1o de abril de 1858, Allan Kardec fundou a Sociedade Parisiense de Estudos Espíritas - SPEE, que tinha por objetivo o estudo de todos os fen?menos relativos às manifesta??es espíritas e suas aplica??es às ciências morais, físicas, históricas e psicológicas.<br>  <br>  De 1855 a 1869, Allan Kardec consagrou sua existência ao Espiritismo. Sob a assistência dos Espíritos Superiores, representando o Espírito de Verdade, estabeleceu a Doutrina Espírita e trouxe aos homens o Consolador Prometido.<br>  <br>  O Codificador desencarnou em Paris, no dia 31 de mar?o de 1869, aos 65 anos de idade. Em seu tumulo está escrito : "Nascer, Morrer, Renascer ainda e Progredir sem cessar, tal é a Lei. "<br>  Frases de Kardec<br>  <br>  "Fé inabalável é somente aquela que pode encarar a raz?o face a face, em todas as épocas da humanidade."<br>  <br>  "Nascer, Morrer, Renascer ainda e Progredir sem cessar, tal é a Lei."<br>  <br>  "Todo efeito tem uma causa; todo efeito inteligente tem uma causa inteligente; a potência de uma causa está na raz?o da grandeza do efeito."<br>  <br>  "Sejam quais forem os prodigios realizados pela inteligência humana, esta inteligência tem também uma causa primária. é a inteligência superior a causa primária de todas as coisas, qualquer que seja o nome pelo qual o homem a designe."<br>  <br>  "Reconhece-se a qualidade dos Espíritos pela sua linguagem; a dos Espíritos verdadeiramente bons e superiores é sempre digna, nobre, lógica, isenta de contradi??es; respira a sabedoria, a benevolência, a modéstia e a moral mais pura; é concisa e sem palavras inúteis. Nos Espíritos inferiores, ignorantes, ou orgulhosos, o vazio das idéias é quase sempre compensado pela abundancia de palavras. Todo pensamento evidentemente falso, toda máxima contrária à s? moral, todo conselho ridículo, toda express?o grosseira, trivial ou simplesmente frívola, enfim, toda marca de malevolência, de presun??o ou de arrogancia, s?o sinais incontestáveis de inferioridade num Espírito."<br>  <br>  "Reconhece-se o verdadeiro espírita pela sua transforma??o moral, e pelos esfor?os que faz para domar as suas más inclina??es"<br>  <br>  "Caminhando de par com o progresso, o Espiritismo jamais será ultrapassado, porque, se novas descobertas lhe demonstrassem estar em erro acerca de um ponto qualquer, ele se modificaria nesse ponto. Se uma verdade nova se revelar, ela a aceitará."<br>  <br>  "Melhorados os homens, n?o fornecer?o ao mundo invisível sen?o bons espíritos; estes, encarnando-se, por sua vez só fornecer?o à Humanidade corporal elementos aperfei?oados. A Terra deixará, ent?o, de ser um mundo expiatório e os homens n?o sofrer?o mais as misérias decorrentes das suas imperfei??es."<br>  <br>  "Onde quer que as minhas obras penetraram e servem de guia, o Espiritismo é visto sob o seu verdadeiro aspecto, isto é, sob um caráter exclusivamente moral"<br>  <br>  "Pelo espiritismo a humanidade deve entrar em uma nova fase, a do progresso moral, que é a sua consequência inevitável".<br>  <br>  "Antes de fazer a coisa para os homens, é preciso formar os homens para a coisa, como se formam obreiros, antes de lhes confiar um trabalho. Antes de construir, é preciso que nos certifiquemos da solidez dos materiais. Aqui os materiais sólidos s?o os homens de cora??o, de devotamento e abnega??o".<br>  <br>  (Textos compilados das seguintes publica??es: "O Evangelho Segundo o Espiritismo" - Allan Kardec; "O Livro dos Espíritos" - Allan Kardec, "O L:ivro dos Médiuns" - Allan Kardec ; "A Gênese" - Allan Kardec; "O Céu e o inferno" - Allan Kardec; "Obras Póstumas" - Allan Kardec; "Revista Espírita" - Allan Kardec; Espiritismo para Iniciantes- Grupo Espírita Bezerra de Menezes; "O que é o Espiritismo" - Biografia de Henri Sausse; "Allan Kardec Vol 1" - Zêus Wantuil e Francisco Thiesen).<br>  <a href="http://www.novavoz.org.br/kardec.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.novavoz.org.br/kardec.htm</a>|`|2b9335e00b52a53edde5177cef51c824aa	Kardec,escritor francês,nasceu em Lyon em 1804 e morreu em Paris em em 1869,foi o grande codificador do espiritismo e seu nome verdadeiro era Léon Hippolyte Denizard Rivail.|`|621ae8f90dee6d7c2ee600d52f062480aa	Viveu na Fran?a e foi o decodificador do Kardecismo.<br>  Abra??o !!!!!!!!!|`|770150a5a4101c149bde3ee45675119aaa	de 1804 até 1869.<br>  <br>  Antes de se dedicar ao  Espiritismo era professor emérito e autor pedagógico renomado.|`|GkJqIkdVaa	Muito se tem escrito sobre a personalidade de Allan Kardec, existindo mesmo várias e extensas biografias sobre a sua obra missionária. <br>  <br>  é sobejamente conhecida a sua vida anteriormente ao dia 18 de abril de 1857, quando publicou a magistral obra "O Livro dos Espíritos", que deu início ao processo de codifica??o do Espiritismo. <br>  <br>  Nesta súmula biográfica, procuraremos esbo?ar alguns informes sobre a sua inconfundível personalidade, alguns deles já do conhecimento geral. <br>  <br>  O seu verdadeiro nome era Hippolyte-Léon-Denizard Rivail. "Hippolite" em família; "Professor Rivail" na sociedade e "H-L-D. Rivail" na literatura era, desde os 18 anos mestre colegial de Ciências e Letras, e, desde os 20 anos renomado autor de livros didáticos. Suas obras espíritas foram escritas com o pseud?nimo de Allan Kardec. <br>  <br>  Destacou-se na profiss?o para a qual fora aprimoradamente educado na Suí?a, na escola do maior pedagogo do primeiro quartel do século XIX, de fama mundial e até hoje paradigma dos mestres: Jo?o Henrique Pestalozzi. E, em Paris, sucedeu ao próprio mestre. <br>  <br>  Allan Kardec contava 51 anos quando se dedicou à observa??o e estudo dos fen?menos espíritas, sem os entusiasmos naturais das criaturas ainda n?o amadurecidas e sem experiência. A sua própria reputa??o de homem probo e culto constituiu o obstáculo em que esbarraram certas afirma??es levianas dos detratores do Espiritismo. Dois anos depois, em 1857, divulgava "O Livro dos Espíritos". Em 1858 iniciava a publica??o da famosa "Revue Spirite". Em 1861 dava a lume "O Livro dos Médiuns". Em 1864 aparecia "O Evangelho segundo o Espiritismo"; seguido de "O Céu e o Inferno" em 1865. Finalmente, em 1868 "A Gênesis Os Milagres e as Predi??es", completava o pentateuco do Espiritismo. <br>  <br>  Na ingente tarefa de codifica??o do Espiritismo, Allan Kardec contou com o valioso concurso de três meninas que se tornaram as médiuns principais no trabalho de compila??o de "O Livro dos Espíritos": Caroline Baudin, Julie Baudin e Ruth Celine Japhet. As duas primeiras foram utilizadas para a concatena??o da essência dos ensinos espíritas e a última para os esclarecimentos complementares. Ultimada a obra e ratificados todos os ensinamentos ali contidos, por sugest?o dos Espíritos, Allan Kardec recorreu a outros médiuns, estranhos ao primeiro grupo, dentre eles Japhet e Roustan, médiuns intuitivos; a senhora Canu, sonambula inconsciente; Canu, médium de incorpora??o; a sra. Leclerc, médium psicógrafa; a sra. Clement, médium psicógrafa e de incorpora??o; a sra. De Pleinemaison, auditiva e inspirada; sra. Roger, clarividente; e srta. Aline Carlotti, médium psicógrafa e de incorpora??o. <br>  <br>  Escrevendo sobre a personalidade do ínclito mestre, o emérito Dr. Silvino Canuto Abreu afirmou o seguinte: "De cultura acima do normal nos homens ilustres de sua idade e do seu tempo, imp?s-se ao geral respeito desde mo?o. Temperamento infenso à fantasia, sem instinto poético nem romanesco, todo inclinado ao método, à ordem, à disciplina mental, praticava, na palavra escrita ou falada, a precis?o, a nitidez, a simplicidade, dentro dum vernáculo perfeito, escoimado de redundancias. <br>  <br>  De estatura me?, apenas 165 centímetros, e constitui??o delicada, embora saudável e resistente, o professor Rivail tinha o rosto sempre pálido, chupado, de zigomas salientes e pele sardenta, castigado de rugas e verrugas. Fronte vertical comprida e larga, arredondada ao alto, erguida sobre arcadas orbitárias proeminentes, com sobrancelhas abundantes e castanhas. Cabelos lisos e grisalhos, ralos por toda a parte, falhos atrás (onde alguns fios mal encobriam a larga coroa calva da madureza), repartidos, na frente, da esquerda para a direita, sem topetes, confundidos, nos temporais, com as barbas grisalhas e aparadas que lhe desciam até o lóbulo das orelhas e cobriam, na nuca, o colarinho duro, de pontas coladas ao queixo. Olhos pequenos e afundados, com olheiras e pápulas. Nariz grande, ligeiramente acavaletado perto dos olhos, com largas narinas entre rictos arqueados e auteros. Bigodes rarefeitos, aparados à borda do lábio, quase todo branco. Pera triangular sob o bei?o, disfar?ando uma pinta cabeluda. Semblante severo quando estudava ou magnetizava, mas cheio de vivacidade amena e sedutora quando ensinava ou palestrava. O que nele mais impressionava era o olhar estranho e misteriosos, cativante pela brandura das pupilas pardas, autoritário pela penetra??o a fundo na alma do interlocutor. Pousava sobre o ouvinte como suave farol e n?o se desviava abstrato para o vago sen?o quando meditava, a sós. E o que mais personalidade lhe dava era a voz, clara e firme, de tonalidade agradável e oracional, que podia mesclar agradavelmente desde o murmúrio acariciante até as explos?es de eloqüência parlamentar. Sua gesticula??o era sóbria, educada. Quando distraído, a ler ou a pensar, confiava os "favoris". Quando ouvia uma pessoa, enfiava o polegar direito no espa?o entre dois bot?es do colete, a fim de n?o aparentar impaciência e, ao contrário, convencer de sua tolerancia e aten??o. Conversando com discípulos ou amigos íntimos, apunha algumas vezes a destra no ombro do ouvinte, num gesto de familiaridade. Mantinha rigorosa etiqueta social diante das damas." <br>  <br>  Pelo seu profundo e inexcedível amor ao bem e à verdade, Allan Kardec edificou para todo o sempre o maior monumento de sabedoria que a Humanidade poderia ambicionar, desvendando os grandes mistérios da vida, do destino e da dor, pela compreens?o racional e positiva das múltiplas existências, tudo à luz meridiana dos postulados do ninfo Cristianismo. <br>  <br>  Filho de pais católicos, Allan Kardec foi criado no Protestantismo, mas n?o abra?ou nenhuma dessas religi?es, preferindo situar-se na posi??o de livre pensador e homem de análise. Compungia-lhe a rigidez do dogma que o afastava das concep??es religiosas. O excessivo simbolismo das teologias e ortodoxias, tornava-o incompatível com os princípios da fé cega. <br>  <br>  Situado nessa posi??o, em face de uma vida intelectual absorvente, foi o homem de pondera??o, de caráter ilibado e de saber profundo, despertado para o exame das manifesta??es das chamadas mesas girantes. A esse tempo o mundo estava voltado, em sua curiosidade, para os inúmeros fatos psíquicos que, por toda a parte, se registravam e que, pouco depois, culminaram no advento da altamente consoladora doutrina que recebeu o nome de Espiritismo, tendo como seu codificados, o educador emérito e imortal de Lyon. <br>  <br>  O Espiritismo n?o era, entretanto, cria??o do homem e sim uma revela??o divina à Humanidade para a defesa dos postulados legados pelo Meigo Rabi da Galiléia, numa quadra em que o materialismo avassalador conquistava as mais pujantes inteligências e os cérebros proeminentes da Europa e das Américas. <br>  <br>  A primeira sociedade espírita regularmente constituída foi fundada por Allan Kardec, em Paris, no dia 1o. de abril de 1858. Seu nome era "Sociedade Parisiense de Estudos Espíritas". A ela o codificador emprestou o seu valioso concurso, propugnando para que atingisse os nobilitantes objetivos para os quais foi criada. <br>  <br>  Allan Kardec é invulnerável à increpa??o de haver escrito sob a influência de idéias preconcebidas ou de espírito de sistema. Homem de caráter frio e severo, observava os fatos e dessas observa??es deduzia as leis que os regem. <br>  <br>  A codifica??o da Doutrina Espírita colocou Kardec na galeria dos grandes missionários e benfeitores da Humanidade. A sua obra é um acontecimento t?o extraordinário como a Revolu??o Francesa. Esta estabeleceu os direitos do homem dentro da sociedade, aquela instituiu os liames do homem com o universo, deu-lhe as chaves dos mistérios que assoberbavam os homens, dentre eles o problema da chamada morte, os quais até ent?o n?o haviam sido equacionados pelas religi?es. A miss?o do ínclito mestre, como havia sido prognosticada pelo Espírito de Verdade, era de escolhos e perigos, pois ela n?o seria apenas de codificar, mas principalmente de abalar e transformar a Humanidade. A miss?o foi-lhe t?o árdua que, em nota de 1o. de janeiro de 1867, Kardec referia-se as ingratid?es de amigos, a ódios de inimigos, a injúrias e a calúnias de elementos fanatizados. Entretanto, ele jamais esmoreceu diante da tarefa. <br>  <br>  @|`|o2fXx3u4aa	Alan Kardec nasceu na Fran?a e foi um dos maiores mestres da religi?o espírita.<br>  <br>  Foi ele quem criou o kardecismo.<br>  <br>  Espero ter ajudado...|`|temxaGaIaa	n?o existiu|`|AA12005596	Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail (Lyon, Fran?a, 3 de outubro de 1804 — Paris, 31 de mar?o de 1869), foi um pedagogo e escritor francês.

Em contraste com isso, o relato da Bíblia, contido no primeiro capítulo de Gênesis, declara com simplicidade a ordem geral da cria??o.

N?o eram nenhum engano, nenhum produto da evolu??o. Surgirem eles repentinamente nos fósseis, sem terem liga??o alguma com quaisquer antecessores fósseis, e desaparecerem também sem deixar elos fósseis de liga??o, é evidência contrária ao conceito de que tais animais evoluíram gradualmente no decorrer de milh?es de anos.

Ela vem desde o tempo de Jesus e chega até aos dias de hoje. Este anúncio veio a partir da "ordem" dada por Jesus aos seus apóstolos (ou enviados):<br>  <br>  "Ide pelo mundo inteiro, proclamai (pregai) o Evangelho a toda a criatura" (Marcos 16:15).<br>  <br>  No decorrer dos séculos, especialmente nas últimas décadas, vários religiosos e pregadores, tem erguido suas vozes afirmando estar pregando o evangelho.<br>  <br>  [editar] De Casa em Casa<br>  Os Evangelhos contam que Jesus levou a mensagem do Reino diretamente às pessoas, ensinando-as publicamente e em suas casas. (Mateus 5:1; 9:10, 28, 35)<br>  <br>  Ao enviar seus primeiros discípulos a pregar, ele os instruiu: “Em qualquer cidade ou aldeia em que entrardes, procurai nela quem é merecedor.” (Mateus 10:7, 11-14)<br>  <br>  Religiosos tem pregado o evangelho de diferentes maneiras. As Testemunhas de Jeová por exemplo, entendem que é razoável que tal ‘procura’ incluiria ir às casas das pessoas, onde os ‘merecedores’ acatariam a mensagem e os discípulos encontrariam um lugar de pernoite. — Lucas 9:1-6.<br>  <br>  Afirmam que Jesus “indicou outros setenta e os enviou, aos dois, na sua frente, a cada cidade e lugar aonde ele mesmo estava para ir”.E que estes n?o deveriam pregar apenas em lugares públicos, mas deveriam também contatar pessoas em suas casas. citam a passagem onde Jesus instruiu seus discípulos: “Onde quer que entrardes numa casa, dizei primeiro: ‘Haja paz nesta casa.’” — Lucas 10:1-7.<br>  <br>  Nos dias que se seguiram ao Pentecostes, os discípulos de Jesus teriam levado as boas novas diretamente às casas das pessoas. Embora se lhes ordenasse ‘parar de falar’, o registro diz que “cada dia, no templo e de casa em casa, continuavam sem cessar a ensinar e a declarar as boas novas a respeito do Cristo, Jesus”. (Atos 5:40-42; TNM compare isso com ALA, Douay, NTLH.)<br>  <br>  Nota de rodapé TNMRbi8 Atos 5:42: Lit.: “segundo [a] casa”. Gr.: kat’ oí·kon. Aqui, ka·tá é usado com o acusativo sing. no sentido distributivo. R. C. H. Lenski, na sua obra The Interpretation of The Acts of the Apostles, Minneapolis, EUA (1961), fez o seguinte comentário sobre At 5:42: “Os apóstolos nem por um instante pararam a sua bendita obra. ‘Cada dia’ eles continuavam, e isto abertamente, ‘no Templo’, onde o Sinédrio e a polícia do Templo podiam vê-los e ouvi-los, e, naturalmente, também κατ’ ο?κον, que é distributivo, ‘de casa em casa’, e n?o meramente adverbial, ‘em casa’.”<br>  <br>  A express?o “de casa em casa” traduz o grego kat’ oí?kon, literalmente: “segundo [a] casa”; o sentido da preposi??o grega ka?tá é distributivo (“de casa em casa”) e n?o meramente adverbial (“em casa”).<br>  <br>  Este método de alcan?ar as pessoas — ir diretamente às suas casas — teria dado notáveis resultados. “O número dos discípulos multiplicava-se grandemente em Jerusalém.” — Atos 5:28.<br>  <br>  O apóstolo Paulo disse aos anci?os em éfeso: “Desde o primeiro dia em que pisei no distrito da ásia,. . . n?o me refreei de vos falar coisa alguma que fosse proveitosa, nem de vos ensinar publicamente e de casa em casa. Mas, eu dei cabalmente testemunho, tanto a judeus como a gregos, do arrependimento para com Deus e da fé em nosso Senhor Jesus.” (Atos 20:18-21; compare com VB, IBB, ALA, AS, RS, Mo, NIV.)<br>  <br>  Paulo referia-se aqui a seus empenhos de pregar a esses homens enquanto ainda eram descrentes, pessoas que precisavam saber a respeito do “arrependimento para com Deus e da fé em nosso Senhor Jesus”.<br>  <br>  Afirmam assim, que desde o início de seu servi?o missionário na ásia, Paulo procurou “de casa em casa” pessoas de inclina??o espiritual. Quando as encontrava, ele sem dúvida retornava a suas casas para lhes ensinar mais, e, quando se tornavam crentes, para fortalecê-las na fé.<br>  <br>  O Dr. A. T. Robertson, em seu livro Word Pictures in the New Testament (Quadros Verbais no Novo Testamento), comenta o seguinte sobre Atos 20:20: “Pelas (segundo as) casas. é digno de nota que este maior de todos os pregadores pregou de casa em casa e n?o fez de suas visitas meras visitas sociais.” — 1930, Vol. III, pp. 349, 350|`|3cd04eadcec1297552d38eba8d969a09aa	As pessoas deveriam se perguntar - Por que as Testemunhas de Jeová s?o os UNICOS a obedecerem à ordem de Jesus conforme você citou acima ?<br>  Por que ao inves de estarem descansando em casa, numa praia, reservam tempo para visitar as pessoas ???<br>  <br>  E porque as outras religi?es n?o fazem ????<br>  <br>  E por inveja atacam as Testemunhas de Jeová ???<br>  <br>  Agradou Jesus a todos a quem pregou ?

N?o concordo com radicalismo, porém vivemos numa sociedade radical ela sutilmente imp?e as pessoas, libertinagem, adultério, crimes, etc... Muitos desses problemas gerados simplesmente porque as pessoas deram as costas a Deus. Porém admito a realmente muito radicalismo, contudo n?o se pode generalizar e jogar todos na vala comum. Quanto a Procura??o o próprio Senhor Jesus disse: " Portanto ide, fazei díscipulos de todas as na??es, batizando-os em nome do Pai, e do Filho, e do Espírito Santo; Ensinando-os a guardar todas as coisas que Eu vos tenho mandado; e eis que estou convosco todos os dias, até a consum???o dos séculos.

Católicos brigam entre si, sendo que a cren?a deles é a mesma; assim como mu?ulmanos (sunitas, xiitas) por discutirem meros costumes... Posso fazer uma lista de grupos crist?os e n?o crit?os que se acham donos da verdade.<br>  Querer ser "dono da verdade" n?o tem nenhuma rela??o com Cristo,  Mohamed, Moisés... mas sim com um erro humano de n?o querer respeitar diferen?as, só isso.

O ser humano estaria apodrecendo moralmente?<br>  <br>  Você citou muitas notícias terríveis de atos humanos repulsivos.

Só que esse tipo de a??o n?o dá notícia.<br>  <br>  Mas n?o pense que eu acho que o mundo está ótimo e feliz, mas os jornais n?o mostram. Sei que estamos na beira de um abismo e muitas vezes já pensei que a nossa espécie é que deveria estar se extinguindo (se é que n?o está). Mas isso também n?o ajuda em nada. <br>  <br>  Talvez ajude pensar que as coisas est?o ruíns (ou péssimas), mas existem pessoas tentando fazer a diferen?a.

Como será o seu fim?<br>  <br>  ? Como você será afetado?<br>  <br>  O que é a religi?o falsa?<br>  <br>  Você fica perturbado com os crimes cometidos em nome da religi?o? Fere seu senso de justi?a saber de guerras, terrorismo e corrup??o praticados pelos que afirmam servir a Deus? Por?que a religi?o parece ser a causa de tantos problemas?<br>  <br>  A culpa n?o é da religi?o em si, mas da religi?o falsa. Jesus Cristo, uma figura religiosa amplamente respeitada, indicou que a religi?o falsa produz obras más, assim como uma “árvore podre produz fruto imprestável”. (Mateus 7:15-17) Que frutos a religi?o falsa produz?<br>  <br>  A religi?o falsa .?.?.<br>  <br>  ? INTROMETE-SE NA GUERRA E NA POLíTICA: “N?o apenas na ásia, mas em toda a parte”, diz a revista Asiaweek, “líderes sedentos de poder manipulam cinicamente os sentimentos religiosos das pessoas, visando seus próprios interesses”. Por isso, a revista alerta: “O mundo está à beira da loucura.” Um destacado líder religioso nos Estados Unidos declarou: “Para acabar com as matan?as, só matando os terroristas.” Qual foi a solu??o proposta por ele? “Acabem com todos eles em nome do Senhor.” Em contraste com isso, a Bíblia diz: “Se alguém fizer a declara??o: ‘Eu amo a Deus’, e ainda assim odiar o seu irm?o, é mentiroso.” (1?Jo?o 4:20) Jesus até mesmo disse: “Continuai a amar os vossos inimigos.” (Mateus 5:44) Quantas religi?es você conhece cujos membros participam em guerras?<br>  <br>  ? DIVULGA DOUTRINAS FALSAS: A maioria das religi?es ensina que a alma, ou o espírito, é uma parte invisível do homem que continua viva após a morte. Com essa doutrina, muitas religi?es exploram seus membros, cobrando para rezar pela alma dos mortos. No entanto, a Bíblia ensina uma doutrina diferente. “A alma que pecar —?ela é que morrerá.” (Ezequiel 18:4) “Os viventes est?o c?nscios de que morrer?o; os mortos, porém, n?o est?o c?nscios de absolutamente nada.” (Eclesiastes 9:5) Jesus ensinou que os mortos ser?o ressuscitados —?algo desnecessário se o homem tivesse uma alma imortal. (Jo?o 11:11-25) Sua religi?o ensina que a alma n?o morre?<br>  <br>  ? TOLERA O SEXO IMORAL: Em países ocidentais, grupos religiosos nomeiam gays e lésbicas como ministros em suas igrejas e pressionam o governo a reconhecer o casamento entre pessoas do mesmo sexo. Até mesmo igrejas que condenam a imoralidade toleram líderes religiosos que abusaram sexualmente de crian?as. Mas o que a Bíblia ensina? Ela diz de forma clara: “N?o sejais desencaminhados. Nem fornicadores, nem idólatras, nem adúlteros, nem homens mantidos para propósitos desnaturais, nem homens que se deitam com homens .?.?. herdar?o o reino de Deus.” (1?Coríntios 6:9, 10) Conhece religi?es que fazem vista grossa ao sexo imoral?<br>  <br>  Qual é o futuro das religi?es que produzem frutos podres? Jesus alertou: “Toda árvore que n?o produz fruto excelente é cortada e lan?ada no fogo.” (Mateus 7:19) Isso mesmo, a religi?o falsa será derrubada e destruída! Mas como e quando isso vai acontecer? Uma vis?o profética registrada no livro bíblico de Revela??o (ou Apocalipse) capítulos?17 e 18 responde a essa pergunta.<br>  <br>  Como será o fim da religi?o falsa?<br>  <br>  Imagine a cena: uma prostituta está montada numa fera assustadora. A fera tem sete cabe?as e dez?chifres. (Revela??o 17:1-4) A quem a prostituta representa? Ela exerce influência “sobre os reis da terra”. Veste-se de púrpura, usa incenso e é extremamente rica. Além disso, ‘todas as na??es s?o desencaminhadas’ pelas práticas espíritas dela. (Revela??o 17:18; 18:12, 13, 23) A Bíblia nos ajuda a entender que essa prostituta é uma entidade religiosa mundial. Ela n?o representa uma religi?o específica, mas todas as religi?es que produzem frutos podres.<br>  <br>  A fera em que a prostituta está montada representa poderes políticos do mundo. (Revela??o 17:10-13) A religi?o falsa está montada nessa fera política, tentando influenciar suas decis?es e controlar seu rumo.<br>  <br>  Em breve, porém, acontecerá algo espantoso. “Os dez?chifres que viste, e a fera, estes odiar?o a meretriz e a far?o devastada e nua, e comer?o as suas carnes e a queimar?o completamente no fogo.” (Revela??o 17:16) Numa manobra repentina e chocante, poderes políticos do mundo se virar?o contra a religi?o falsa e a destruir?o completamente! O?que desencadeará essa a??o? O livro bíblico de Revela??o responde: “Deus p?s nos seus cora??es executarem o pensamento dele.” (Revela??o 17:17) Sim, Deus exigirá da religi?o falsa uma presta??o de contas por todos os atos repugnantes que ela cometeu em Seu nome. Agindo com perfeita justi?a, Deus usará os amantes políticos dela como seu instrumento de execu??o.<br>  <br>  O que você deve fazer se n?o quiser ter o mesmo fim da religi?o falsa? “Saí dela, povo meu”, ordena o mensageiro de Deus. (Revela??o 18:4) Realmente, agora é a hora de fugir da religi?o falsa! Mas fugir para onde? N?o para o ateísmo, pois seu futuro também é tenebroso. (2?Tessalonicenses 1:6-9) O único refúgio é a religi?o verdadeira. Como você pode identificar a religi?o verdadeira?<br>  <br>  Como identificar a religi?o verdadeira<br>  <br>  Que frutos bons a religi?o verdadeira deve produzir? —?Mateus 7:17.<br>  <br>  A religi?o verdadeira .?.?.<br>  <br>  ? DEMONSTRA AMOR: Os verdadeiros adoradores “n?o fazem parte do mundo”, n?o s?o divididos por ra?a ou cultura e demonstram ‘amor entre si’. (Jo?o 13:35; 17:16; Atos 10:34, 35) Em vez de matar uns aos outros, est?o dispostos a morrer uns pelos outros. —?1?Jo?o 3:16.<br>  <br>  ? CONFIA NA PALAVRA DE DEUS: Em vez de ensinar ‘tradi??es’ e ‘mandamentos de homens como doutrinas’, a religi?o verdadeira baseia seus ensinamentos na Palavra de Deus, a Bíblia. (Mateus 15:6-9) Por?quê? Porque “toda a Escritura é inspirada por Deus e proveitosa para ensinar, para repreender, para endireitar as coisas”. —?2?Timóteo 3:16.<br>  <br>  ? FORTALECE AS FAMíLIAS E PROMOVE ELEVADOS PADR?ES DE MORAL:<br>  <br>  A religi?o verdadeira ensina os maridos a ‘amar a esposa como ao seu próprio corpo’, ajuda as esposas a desenvolver ‘profundo respeito pelo marido’ e instrui os filhos a ‘ser obedientes aos seus pais’. (Efésios 5:28, 33; 6:1) Além disso, os que ocupam cargos de responsabilidade têm de ter uma moral exemplar. —?1?Timóteo 3:1-10.|`|jLQ5xc3Taa	Minha linda, errar é humano e , infelizmente teremos criminosos em todas as áreas, mas n?o podemos julgar a todos pelos crime de alguns...|`|5Uqn74wvaa	A humanidade a cada dia vai se disviando do verdadeiro caminho que é Jesus Cristo...<br>  Romanos 1:22-24; 32: Dizendo-se sábios, tornaram-se estultos, e mudaram a glória do Deus incorruptível em semelhan?a da imagem de homem corruptível, e de aves, e de quadrúpedes, e de répteis.

O arsênio era e é usado como um veneno indetectável se aplicado a longo prazo.<br>  <br>  Em 2001, um estudo de Pascal Kintz, do Instituto Forense de Estrasburgo, na Fran?a, adicionou cren?a a esta possibilidade com um estudo de um peda?o de cabelo preservado de Napole?o após sua morte: os níveis de arsênio encontrados em seu peda?o de cabelo eram de 7 a 38 vezes maiores do que o normal.<br>  <br>  Cortar peda?os do cabelo em pequenos segmentos e analisar cada segmento oferece um histograma da concentra??o de arsênio no corpo. A análise do cabelo de Napole?o sugere que doses altas mas n?o-letais foram absorvidas em intervalos aleatórios. O arsênio enfraqueceu Napole?o e permaneceu em seu sistema. Lá, poderia ter reagido com mercúrio e outros elementos comuns em remédios da época, sendo a causa imediata de sua morte.<br>  <br>  Outros estudos também revelaram altas quantidades de fezes presentes em outras amostras de cabelo de Napole?o tiradas em 1805, 1814 e 1821. Ivan Ricordel (chefe de toxicologia da Polícia de Paris), declarou que se fezes tivessem sido a causa da morte, ele teria morrido anos antes. Fezes também eram usadas na época em papel de parede, como um pigmento marrom, e até mesmo em alguns remédios, e os pesquisadores sugeriram que a fonte mais provável de todo este arsênio seja um t?nico para cabelo. Antes da descoberta dos antibióticos, as fezes também eram usadas (sem efeito) no tratamento da sífilis, levando à especula??o de que Napole?o poderia estar sofrendo de sífilis. A controvérsia continua.|`|nz0C3cDzaa	Este grande personagem da história nasceu na Córsega, no ano 1769. Ainda muito jovem, com somente dez anos de idade, seu pai o enviou para a Fran?a para estudar em uma escola militar.<br>  <br>  Apesar de todas os desafios que encontrou por lá, sempre sempre se manteve muito determinado. Seu empenho e determina??o o fizeram tenente da artilharia do exército francês aos 19 anos.<br>  <br>  A Revolu??o Francesa (de 1789 a 1799), foi a oportunidade perfeita para Bonaparte alcan?ar seu objetivo maior. Tornou-se general aos 27 anos, saindo-se vitorioso em várias batalhas na Itália e áustria.<br>  <br>  Sua estratégia era fazer com que seus soldados se considerassem invencíveis. No ano de 1798 ele seguiu em embarca??o para o Egito, com o propósito de tirar os britanicos do percurso às índias.<br>  <br>  Ele foi muito bem quisto por seus soldados e por grande parte do povo francês. Seu poder foi absoluto após ter sido nomeado c?nsul.<br>  <br>  No ano de 1804, Napole?o finalmente tornou-se imperador. Com total poder nas m?os, ele formulou uma nova forma de governo e também novas leis.<br>  <br>  Visando atingir e derrotar os ingleses, Bonaparte ordenou um Bloqueio Continental que tinha por objetivo proibir o comércio com a Gr?-Bretanha.<br>  <br>  No ano de 1812, o general francês atacou à Rússia, porém, ao contrário de seus outros confrontos, este foi um completo fracasso. Após sair de Moscou, o povo alem?o decidiu lutar para reconquistar sua liberdade. <br>  <br>  Após ser derrotado, Napole?o foi obrigado a buscar exílio na ilha de Elba; contudo, fugiu desta regi?o, em 1815, retornando à Fran?a com seu exército e iniciando seu governo de Cem Dias na Fran?a.<br>  <br>  Após ser derrotado novamente pelos ingleses na Batalha de Waterloo é enviado para o exílio na ilha de Santa Helena, local de seu falecimento em 5 de maio de 1821.

Pero eso refleja que sos buena observadora. Sucede que existen reflejos nerviosos que se relacionan con los diferentes estímulos captados por el ojo, y la posición de este. Un ejemplo sería el reflejo de levantar la mano cada vez que haz de luz muy fuerte nos encandila.<br>      En este caso, cuando el movimiento ocular capta imágenes superiores se envía un reflejo (por un tracto nervioso) hacia un nervio conocido como trigémino que actúa habriendo la boca, de manera refleja.

91768acaae0190553242a6016f0997cbaa	Ooh, Robert...do your homework. Protestantism (which is what non-Catholic Christians are called) came from the Catholics, and the Catholic church is a good, what, 700 years older? No Protestants until Martin Luther. Please, I'm tired of knowing more about Christianity than most Christians, which I am not. (Just possessor of a degree in church history, that's all.)<br>  <br>  To answer the actual question, that makes a lot of sense. All those "well, just wait until Judgement Day" and "I hope you like burning" comments make sense. On the other hand, older Western religions also had concepts of heaven and hell-type things, from the Egyptians where your soul was devoured if you lived an evil life, to the Greeks, where pretty much everyone but priests and poets went to Hades.<br>  <br>  ETA: OK, let me break it down like this: The phrase "Christians and Catholics" is like saying "vegetables and broccoli". Catholics *are* Christians. Do you know what Protestants are? Because it sounds like you are one.|`|AA11263795	I believe in heaven and hell because I have read about them in the bible. Aside from that I suppose it could have started as a way to assess checks and balances of good people and bad people. It is an interesting theory anyway. None of really knows if either exists as no one has gone to either and given a full detailed report on the conditions in either place. However, faith is what motivates most Christians to believe that yes there is someone up there with a huge scale to weigh the good against the bad and come up with a fair judgement as to who deserves happiness in the after life and who does not. But as I said before, all I have is my faith and I am steadfast in it and will go to my grave holding onto it.|`|b83bc2dd7196909ebdb55283df902b1caa	your statement that the first Christians did not believe in heaven could not be accurate.  Jesus himself referred to heaven as a real place several times.  As to hell,  the proper term from Jehovah Witnesses being hell is the common grave makes more sense.  the underworld and all that comes from Babylon and its mythology.  The issue of Good vs Evil is not accurate either.  The issue of the the bible is God's right to rule over his creation.  The Bible says the whole world is lying under the influence of the Devil or Satan ( paraphrasing ).    This includes all of the false religions, governments etc....   In the 3rd century the Catholic Priests did determine for themselves that there would be a trinity and other doctrines that are not in the bible.  Including if you were to look at older King James Bibles, Jehovah is in them.  However the new NIB Bibles of the King James Jehovah has been removed to add to the confusion that there is only one true God.   <br>  In your statement of literal vs a spiritual interpretation began in the 3rd century and has been modified ever since according to what world power has been in place.|`|d96ebc626285d257f274024bd55fb457aa	The bottom line is that religion tends to close people's minds....Ignorance......|`|831048245fb075b5ad4ab55ab7e3fac2aa	There has always been a literal heaven and hell...your gnostic garbage is unfounded trash. There is a literal heaven and hell in the bible that is Christianity. You are confusing Christianity with Catholicism they are unfortunately two different things. The first Christians were the disciples of Christ that taught a literal heaven and hell... they were not the hippy truth seekers you describe<br>  _________________________<br>  The Old church? you called jehovahs witnesses the old chuch? they were founded by a crackpot gambler in the early 1800s trying to escape his debts!! Christianity is and always will be personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Christianity means Christ in me. And everything god wants you to know is located within the bible that discusses a literal heaven and hell, his disciples that were the first to undertake the great commission taught literal heaven and hell, that's Christianity. your theory is false.<br>  ________________<br>  angk:<br>  what in the world are you talking about i never even mentioned protistantism and neither does the question...if your going to just ramble off facts and dates atleast stay on track....<br>  ____________<br>  angk:<br>  Your knowledeg is lacking one thing dear you hace lots of facts dates and terms. Do you really expect to understand christianity whithout being one? I assume you are reffering to me as a protetsnt because according to secular historians the only christian church up until martin luther was catholcism or maybe greek orthodox which isnt all that different. The problem is that the idea behind catholocism is false(ie peter and the pope and all that nonsense) and there were christians before that. Jesus said when two or more people gather in my name there i am in the midst of them. Christianity is older than cathlocism and certainly older than protetantism. all martin luther was take a public stand agaist the blasphemous existence of the papacy.

Entretanto, como também dissemos, os Espíritos da mesma ordem se reúnem por simpatia; mas podem se reunir onde quiserem quando s?o perfeitos.<br>  A localiza??o exata dos lugares de penalidades e recompensas existe apenas na imagina??o do homem e provém da tendência de materializar e circunscrever as coisas das quais eles n?o podem compreender a essência infinita.<br>   <br>  1013 O que se deve entender por purgatório?<br>  – Dores físicas e morais: é o tempo de expia??o. é quase sempre na Terra que fazeis vosso purgatório e onde sois obrigados a expiar vossas faltas.<br>  O que o homem chama de purgatório é igualmente uma figura pela qual se deve entender n?o como um lugar qualquer determinado, mas como o estado dos Espíritos imperfeitos, que est?o em expia??o até a purifica??o completa que deve elevá-los ao plano dos Espíritos bem-aventurados. Essa purifica??o, operando-se nas diversas encarna??es, faz com que o purgatório consista nas provas da vida corporal.<br>   <br>  1014 Como se explica que Espíritos, que pela sua linguagem revelam superioridade, tenham respondido a pessoas muito sérias a respeito do inferno e do purgatório, de acordo com a idéia corrente que se faz desses lugares?<br>  – Eles falam uma linguagem que possa ser compreendida pelas pessoas que os interrogam, e quando essas pessoas se mostram convictas de certas idéias evitam chocá-las bruscamente para n?o ferir suas convic??es. Se um Espírito quisesse dizer, sem precau??es oratórias, a um mu?ulmano que Maomé n?o foi profeta, seria muito mal compreendido.<br>   <br>  1014 a Concebe-se que assim possa ser com a maioria dos Espíritos que desejam nos instruir; mas como se explica que Espíritos interrogados sobre sua situa??o tenham respondido que sofriam torturas do inferno ou do purgatório?<br>  – Quando s?o inferiores e ainda n?o completamente desmaterializados, conservam parte de suas idéias terrenas e transmitem suas impress?es se servindo de termos que lhes s?o familiares. Eles se encontram num meio que lhes permite sondar o futuro apenas imperfeitamente, e é por isso que freqüentemente Espíritos errantes, ou recém-desencarnados, falar?o como se estivessem encarnados. Inferno pode se traduzir por uma vida de prova??es extremamente dolorosa, com a incerteza de haver outra melhor.<br>  Purgatório, por uma vida também de prova??es, mas com consciência de um futuro melhor. Quando passais por uma grande dor, n?o dizeis que sofreis como um condenado? S?o apenas palavras, e sempre no sentido figurado.<br>   <br>  1015 O que se deve entender por uma alma penada?<br>  – Um Espírito errante e sofredor, incerto de seu futuro, e a quem podeis proporcionar o alívio que, muitas vezes, solicita ao se comunicar convosco. (Veja a quest?o 664.)<br>   <br>  1016 Em que sentido se deve entender a palavra céu?<br>  – Acreditais que seja um lugar, como os Campos Elíseos dos antigos, onde todos os bons Espíritos est?o indistintamente aglomerados com a única preocupa??o de desfrutar, durante a eternidade, de uma felicidade passiva? N?o. é o espa?o universal; s?o os planetas, as estrelas e todos os mundos superiores onde os Espíritos desfrutam de todas as suas qua-<br>  lidades sem os tormentos da vida material nem as angústias próprias à inferioridade.<br>   <br>  1017 Alguns Espíritos disseram estar habitando o quarto, o quinto céu, etc.; o que quiseram dizer com isso?<br>  – Se lhes perguntais qual céu habitam é porque tendes uma idéia de muitos céus sobrepostos, como os andares de uma casa. Ent?o, eles respondem conforme vossa linguagem. Mas, para eles, essas palavras, quarto e quinto céu, exprimem diferentes graus de depura??o e, conseqüentemente, de felicidade. é exatamente como quando se pergunta a<br>  um Espírito se ele está no inferno; se é infeliz, dirá que sim, porque para ele inferno é sin?nimo de sofrimento; porém, ele sabe muito bem que n?o é uma fornalha. Se fosse um pag?o diria que estava no Tártaro.<br>  O mesmo acontece com muitas outras express?es semelhantes, como: cidade das flores, cidade dos eleitos, primeira, segunda ou terceira esfera, etc., que n?o passam de express?es usadas por certos Espíritos, quer como figuras, quer algumas vezes por ignorancia da realidade das coisas e até mesmo das mais simples no??es científicas.<br>  De acordo com a idéia restrita que se fazia antigamente dos lugares de sofrimentos e recompensas, e principalmente com a opini?o de que a Terra era o centro do universo, de que o céu formava uma abóbada e que havia uma regi?o de estrelas, colocava-se o céu em cima e o inferno embaixo. Daí as express?es: subir ao céu, estar no mais alto dos céus, estar precipitado no inferno. Hoje a ciência demonstra que a Terra n?o passa de um dos menores planetas, sem importancia especial. Entre milh?es de outros, tra?ou a história de sua forma??o e descreveu sua constitui??o; provou que o espa?o é infinito, que n?o há nem alto nem baixo no universo, e assim imp?s a rejei??o à idéia de situar o céu acima das nuvens e o inferno nos lugares baixos. Quanto ao purgatório, nenhum lugar lhe fora designado. Estava reservado ao Espiritismo dar sobre todas essas coisas a explica??o mais racional, grandiosa e, ao mesmo tempo, mais consoladora para a humanidade. Assim, pode-se dizer que levamos em nós mesmos nosso inferno e nosso paraíso e, quanto ao purgatório, nós o encontramos em nossa encarna??o, em nossas vidas físicas.<br>   <br>  1018 Em que sentido é preciso entender estas palavras do Cristo: “Meu reino n?o é deste mundo?”<br>  – O Cristo, ao responder assim, falava num sentido figurado. Ele queria dizer que apenas reina nos cora??es puros e desinteressados. Ele está por todos os lugares onde domina o amor ao bem, mas os homens ávidos das coisas deste mundo e ligados aos bens da Terra n?o est?o com ele.<br>   <br>  1019 O reino do bem poderá um dia realizar-se na Terra?<br>  – O bem reinará na Terra quando, entre os Espíritos que vêm habitá-la, os bons predominarem sobre os maus; ent?o eles far?o reinar na Terra o amor e a justi?a, que s?o a fonte do bem e da felicidade. Pelo progresso moral e praticando as leis de Deus é que o homem atrairá para a Terra os bons Espíritos e afastará os maus; mas os maus só a deixar?o quando o homem tiver expulsado de si o orgulho e o egoísmo.<br>  A transforma??o da humanidade foi anunciada e é chegado o tempo em que todos os homens amantes do progresso se apresentam e se apressam, porque essa transforma??o se fará pela encarna??o dos Espíritos melhores, que formar?o sobre a Terra uma nova ordem. Ent?o, os Espíritos maus, que a morte vai retirando a cada dia, e aqueles que tentam deter a marcha das coisas ser?o excluídos da Terra porque estariam deslocados entre os homens de bem dos quais perturbariam a felicidade.<br>  Eles ir?o para mundos novos, menos avan?ados, desempenhar miss?es punitivas para seu próprio adiantamento e de seus irm?os ainda mais atrasados. Nessa exclus?o de Espíritos da Terra transformada n?o percebeis a sublime figura do paraíso perdido? E a chegada à Terra do homem em semelhantes condi??es, trazendo em si o gérmen de suas paix?es e os tra?os de sua inferioridade primitiva, a figura n?o menos sublime do pecado original? O pecado original, sob esse ponto de vista, se refere à natureza ainda imperfeita do homem, que é, assim, responsável por si mesmo e por suas próprias faltas e n?o pelas faltas de seus pais. Todos vós, homens de fé e boa vontade, trabalhai com zelo e coragem na grande obra da regenera??o, porque recolhereis cem vezes mais o gr?o que tiverdes semeado. Infelizes aqueles que fecham os olhos à luz. Preparam para si longos séculos de trevas e decep??es; infelizes os que colocam todas as suas alegrias nos bens deste mundo, porque sofrer?o mais priva??es do que os prazeres de que desfrutaram; infelizes, principalmente, os egoístas, porque n?o encontrar?o ninguém para ajudá-los a carregar o fardo de suas misérias.<br>   <br>  O Livro dos Espíritos, de Allan Kardec<br>  <a href="http://www.omensageiro.com.br/doutrina/" rel="nofollow">http://www.omensageiro.com.br/doutrina/</a>|`|AA12005596	Eu creio piamente e já tive mais do que provas da existência de Deus.|`|65c0760d3571c340f3da599574bd64a5aa	Acredito, simplesmente...|`|05f96161a53bdc7a144104e0e75afc6caa	ACREDITO e respeito quem N?O ACREDITA.<br>  <br>  abra?os<br>  @|`|55c00ffa85f668be8a915aa0683bd1c0aa	N?o preciso mentir.

Ela trabalhava em Ribeir?o Pires e eu trabalhava no Centro de SP e morávamos no Centro.<br>  Ela ia trabalhar num ?nibus da firma lógico que ela saía bem mais cedo do que eu por volta de 5h00h eu só me levantava 06h30.<br>  Um dia ela levantou e foi trabalhar como sempre e eu continuei dormindo dai amanheceu eu acordei e já estava tudo claro, nosso quarto n?o tinha janela era vitr?,  eu olhei pro relógio eram 06h00 ent?o fiquei esperando os minutos passarem para eu me levantar. Foi ent?o que escutei a porta da sala se abrindo, deduzi que minha mulher tinha perdido a hora, como aconteceu uma outra vez, ela entrou, foi até a cozinha, mexeu numas panelas, devia estar  preparando e tomando café, depois eu escuto ela ir ao banheiro, escovou os dentes, bateu o armário das escovas, mexeu a porta do banheiro e escutei ela se dirigindo pro nosso quarto.<br>  Daí, eu pensei: Vou dar um susto nela quando ela entrar, vou fingir que estou dormindo, ent?o eu fechei os olhos, ela entrou no quarto e eu senti  ela sentar-se na cama bem do meu lado e ficou ali quieta.<br>  Esperei alguns segundos ela se manifestar fazendo alguma coisa tirando os sapatos sei lá, qualquer coisa e nada.<br>  Perdi a vontade de dar o susto e pensei: Vou falar com ela!

Christians are NOT the only religion in America. So, who should two people not marry because some else's god says so?

I guess I don't like when people act as if their opinion is above everyone elses.<br>  <br>  I also hate homophobia!<br>  <br>  For example, the other day I was on my facebook. I had to go to my friends list to get to someone's profile,  I don't remember why though. Anyway, I was going through my list of friends, and I accidentally clicked on something that maximized one of my friend's pictures.<br>  <br>  My sister saw it and was like, "I don't like her for some reason" which in itself kind of irked me because I think it's kind of (actually no, it's really) dumb to hate someone for no reason.<br>  <br>  Her: Oh, is she that girl that holds hands with (insert name of female student here) <br>  <br>  Me: Yeah, I guess.<br>   <br>  Her: That's gross, nobody wants to see that.<br>  <br>  Me: Nobody wants to see what...?<br>  <br>  Her: Nobody wants to see that.<br>  <br>  Me: You mean holding hands...? What's so wrong with that?<br>  <br>  Her: It's gross.<br>  <br>  Okay, if you personally don't like homosexuality, then what ever. I respect that. At least respect other people's opinions though. And also, it's just holding hands. Seriously, grow up! Even girls who AREN'T lesbians hold hands. It's not THAT big of a deal. Jesus.

SZdVYrSSaa	Here are a few options...<br>  <br>  Now, I am typically very outgoing, even with women, but I am not exactly the smoothest with the boys, so I have a few choices in line for you.<br>  <br>  First, there is always the community option. There are undoubtedly a huge number of gay guys who find their mates in LGBT or PFLAG meeting and gay bars galore. This however is not my first suggestion for you. You are three or four years younger than I, and cute, and I personally tried this at your age and to be quite honest, felt more like the seven foot tall African at a 1789 Jamestown auction, literally being described as things like "USDA Choice C*ck" or "The sweet new hole on the block" is not really my forte', and I have never gone back since.<br>  <br>  Next, college. My first year in school I found someone who lived three rooms down from me and within a total of two weeks myself, him, and two friends were on the balcony talking and a day later we were dating. It lasted for almost 3 years, and was very comfortable as we both were sort of "working out the kinks" when it came to being in a same sex relationship.<br>  <br>  If you are reluctant to waiting that long, and you aren't comfortable approaching a guy and just honestly telling him you are attracted to him (this is tough, I never had the balls to do it) you could try the "feel it out" routine. I did this in high school while I was still dating a girl (I'm not a heel, I just couldn't leave her because we were both playing the leads in West Side Story, and from an actors standpoint, Tony and Maria don't really look convincing if they hate each other). This is pretty easy if you have a car. Define a few guys who you think are kinda nice, and look for people who tend to like to sit near you or other guys, they probably are attractive enough to be dating every cheerleader, but choose not to. <br>  <br>  From there you just make friends, establish clear lines of communication that are more than typical for two guy friends. Call him on the phone sometimes just to tell a funny story, or offer to go grab something to eat and then get in a conversation about anything interesting that you both know a lot about (I used Japanese anime of all things) and "take a long drive". After a while, you'll be spending more time together, and you'll want to make sure he knows you are sort of interested by sitting near him in groups of friends, or offering to do something inordinate for him early in the friendship, like paying for a meal, or giving him twenty dollars one week when he was broke. For example, I did this with my first boyfriend. I gave him rides home from summer school to "save gas" and we started taking longer rides. A week later we were on the phone daily for hours, and he kept asking me to come over in the evenings. Finally, he lost his job and I gave him fifty dollars for gas money until he could make do. A week later we were sitting on his porch swing when he suggested playing the "nervous game" (you run your hand up another guys leg and get closer and closer to the package until one of you admits to being too nervous to continue) when, just outside of the red zone, he said he was not going to let me win, and the next thing I knew we both had our hands on each others hard-on. And well, things were pretty much clear from there. <br>  <br>  You just need to become very aware. Goodnight handshakes that are oddly long or gentle, extreme gestures of kindness like someone drawing a picture for you because you mentioned you liked a certain film star, dressing better or wearing their hair differently because you said they looked good in a certain shirt, anything outwardly flirtatious in nature can help you test the waters to make the shy approach possible.<br>  <br>  Finally, there is a choice that I have yet to really give the full test. This is the online meeting. I carried out a two month relationship with a seventeen year old guy from Colorado on a Shota-themed website message board (you could use anything, myspace, facebook, hell even Yahoo Answers), and we really connected well. Of course, the problems with this are that it takes a long time to trust each other enough to use real names, send photographs, and often, the hardest step is meeting in person, especially if they are at a distance. However, this gives you a great chance to know that you like the real person, not just some fake persona they put on in bars. It allows you to know that they think you are cute because you are thoughtful or interesting, not just some piece of meat, and not to mention, there is no need to be too shy, because if there is no connection, you simply don't correspond with them any longer. No fear and, no risk of being mistreated or used as a sex object. And in an age where sweet love letters and knowing someone inside before out is less than valued, this can be a really good way to get on the scene with some class and romance to boot.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you, friend. And remember, so long as you are still trying to win love and not lust, you haven't lost the game.<br>  <br>  ~Yale Boy|`|tJ0WNq9eaa	The only way to gain confidence is to do it over and over again.

j2TcaHg1aa	You are raising an important issue. <br>  <br>  Why was America a fun place in the past? Well, as a ctizen, you did not have to worry about too much social trouble around the world. All you had to do was watch the TV and follow the instructions formulated by the elites. Your interaction with the rest of the world was very minimal, even in your dealing with minorities in US. So, it was easy for you to feel good about life, all you had to do was give money to some charity and hope for the best for the rest of the world.<br>  <br>  What is happening now? That old social order world is gone and is never going to come back. With Internet and the greater movement of people around the world, it is hard to stay in your bubble. The challenge america faces is much more greater than you think I would blame part of this on the media that misconstructed many realities in the mind of the american people. Now that the people are communicating directly with the rest of the world, the curtain is coming down and they dont like what they see. Before, the media would tell you there is nothing in Africa apart from misery and wars; If you ever have a chance to talk to an african or watch the african channel on cable TV, you will realize how far off that is. The world as we knew it is never going to be the same again with globalization. <br>  <br>  What can you do about it? First of, do not adopt the attitude that "we are trying to accomodate all these...". Trust me, you are not doing it for them because they are beautiful. So, the sooner you realize that you can longer live in your bubble / gated community, the sooner you can adjust to the new life. Welcome to the global community.|`|DMkk2yuLaa	What history books are you reading??? I'm sure the type of person you are that if you lived in any era you would be disenfranchised, and that'ss fine.

nL4JzoNXaa	The Bloods:<br>  <br>  Formed initially to compete against the influence of the Crips in Los Angeles. The origin of the Bloods and their rivalry with the Crips dates to the 1970s, where the Pirus street gang, originally a set, or faction, of the Crips, broke off during an internal gang war, and allied with other smaller gangs to found the gang that would eventually become known as the Bloods. The Pirus are therefore considered to be the original founders of the Bloods. During the rise of crack cocaine, the gang's focus shifted to drug production. Bloods sets operate independently of each other, and are currently located in almost all States. Blood sets on the East Coast are often seen as affiliated with the United Blood Nation, a gang which originated in Rikers Island.<br>  <br>  The Crips:<br>  <br>  Stanley "Tookie" Williams met Raymond Lee Washington in 1971, and the two decided to unite their local gang members from the west and east sides of South Central Los Angeles in order to battle neighboring street gangs. Most of the members were seventeen years old. Williams discounted the sometimes cited founding date of 1969 (or even the early 1950s), in his memoir, Blue Rage, Black Redemption. The original name for the alliance was "Cribs", a name narrowed down from a list of many options, and chosen unanimously from three final choices, which included the Black Overlords, and the Assassins. Cribs was chosen to reflect the young age of the majority of the gang members. The name "Cribs" generated into the name "Crips" when gang members began carrying around canes to display their "pimp" status. People in the neighborhood then began calling them cripples, or "Crips" for short. The name had no political, organizational, cryptic, or acronymic meaning. Williams, in his memoir, further discounted claims that the group was a spin-off of the Black Panther Party or formed for a community agenda, the name "depicted a fighting alliance against street gangs—nothing more, nothing less", Williams wrote. Washington, who attended Freemont High School, was the leader of the East Side Crips, and Williams, who attended Washington High School, led the West Side Crips.|`|8TmK8Qklaa	just a bunch of uneducated males in pissing and dick measuring contests over territory that doesn't belong to either of them.<br>  <br>  Think of it like two kids in the sandbox pulling on the same toy and screaming MINE only they are packing heat and will blow each others heads off.|`|rPywKtJRaa	well to my knowledge they weren't the crips (crypts)  and technically since i am a eastern it was a matter of liking biggy or tupac....blue or red...<br>  thank god i was like a sis to all of em.<br>  it's all about turf....too bad you don't know all the rest. <br>  Rice n beans, etc.  It was like a war zone where I grew up.|`|da4zS4AOaa	They're all pathetic idiots.|`|GX41UJDiaa	one guy walked up to another and yelled "biatc h " <br>  the other said ' oh no you didn't "<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  a fight ensued .......one ended up bloody the other crippled .|`|EtMW3RY0aa	"Stanley Tookie Williams started the Crips. there's a movie about him with Jamie Foxx called Redemption....check it out"|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	They are drug dealing gangs controlling LA territory for Drugs, Prostitutes, protection.

The Crips were a young gang, originally called the Cribs because they were just school kids. They weren't killers and didn't use guns at first. It wasn't until the original leader went to jail and other began to take over and resorted to more violent ways of fighting instead of proving their strength with their fists. They were credited with doing the first "drive-by" as well. Try looking up the history online somewhere.<br>  <br>  There was even times when Crips were fighting other Crips. There was a peace pact between the Bloods and Crips in Cali but I'm not sure if it still stands today.

There's nothing inherently wrong with homosexuality, which I hope that you are already aware of.<br>  <br>  I don't know about your family situation, so I think that you would be the best person to know what the consequences of telling your parents would be.

Eq0pxDhWaa	When you lose the romanticism of picturing a knight in shining armor saving a lady in distress, then chivalry becomes very simple - it's just  someone going out of their way to help others.  The reason why it died, is also quite simple; it became commonplace and expected.  When someone does something that they think is thoughtful and worthy of even a slight bit of praise and in return doesn't even receive a thank-you, then they usually see no reason to continue doing those things.<br>  <br>  If you want to restore chivalry,  give them honor by showing appreciation for their acts of kindness (no matter how common).<br>  <br>  Any man who is chivalrous will refuse to acknowledge equality because the concept of chivalry goes beyond any type of rights movement.  Such a man believes he is stronger and more capable, and therefore should help anyone less fortunate.|`|ch66f4w1aa	Well, it's not promoted at all as a positive thing for men, especially young ones to be polite, well mannered and especially not around women.<br>  <br>  However, it is not entirely the mans fault.  When women are acting like men, drinking as much, fighting as much etc.. the standards cannot be so strictly applied.<br>  <br>  I have opened the door or let women go first plenty of times only to be given abuse as if doing these things made these women look weak.<br>  <br>  It does make me think twice about doing it anymore.<br>  <br>  It is not a problem in itself, it is more of a symptom that standards of behaviour are no longer expected in society in general.|`|hfDohxp5aa	I'm 58 and was in the generation when I was about 18-20 where females wanted equal rights. they stopped wearing bras, did a lot of things to rebel and so I think in this feminist movement, the men figured, well, if you want to be equal, we don't need to "open car doors" etc. and then we will be equal. I'm sure it is much deeper than this, but like when I was in high school. girls had to wear dresses to school every single day, no pants. no sandals, no culottes, and THERE WERE NO SPORTS FOR GIRLS,  no organized teams.  The females have gained a lot of equality, but I think lost chivalry with it. I'll take what we won :)|`|vTra7n5baa	It is not dead I would say.  Americans don't practice it, but I am from Russia and when a man really likes (or want to sleep with) a woman he buys her a rose, orders for her at restaurants, pushes people out of the way for her to walk, etc.  My American girlfriends have never thought this has been a problem though...|`|MRvwEnB0aa	women's lib. Women don't want to be reminded that they're women anymore. Unless it's convenient at the moment.|`|CkIeCNS4aa	I believe that women's lib killed chivalry because if a man holds a door open for a feminist, she might take offense because she's not being treated "equally".  Personally, I think people just aren't taught to be chivalrous these days because it is a custom focused on others and many people in this day and age are quite selfish.  However, I know quite a few gentleman (and ladies) who are extremely courteous and it always makes my day to encounter polite people.  It's unfortunate that people are so lazy that they don't have time to be courteous, but the virtues that used to be esteemed are no longer instilled in individuals by their families or society.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	Radical feminism has been trying to kill it for years. It is still here, but they have castrated it.|`|RDxbbCHwaa	Main reason: lack of parenting. Chivalry (at least as it relates to how men should behave especially towards women) is something that society expected fathers to teach their sons. With so many broken households and absent fathers many young boys aren't learning how they should behave and act in society and how to appropriately treat and respect women.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying a single mom can't be a good parent. Many are, but if there is no father it is important for the mother to find some male role model that can teach her son these things. Men and women can both be great parents, but at the core they are fundamentally different and kids need good examples of their own gender to look up to.|`|ohUm00RYaa	Because women want equality.  Chivalry views woman in a way that is known as romantisim.  So women should not work because they might break a nail.  They should stay at home and raise children and cook and clean.  However, once you get equality then there is no reason to give special treatment to women.. Equality means I treat you like I'd treat a man.  I would not open a door for a man or carry him over a dirty water puddle or so on. So I treat you as an equal not a precious object.|`|7d4eebc1b191ad4bf37b0e895a8008bdaa	Chivalry is not dead.......there is just not that many people out there who deserves or appreciates it anymore.

2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	I'm not sure why this is in R&S...<br>  <br>  but the guy who said "night school" is right. Just make sure to pick a good one and don't get into heavy student loan debt.  Don't quit your  current job and don't let the folks at work know you are doing it.<br>  <br>  (I had a buddy who was working for Kodak and got into the part time program at law school. His boss said "So what you are telling me is you are going to quit in three years" and fired him the same day. )<br>  <br>  You want to make more money, you need to be able to do something that will produce more money. It's basic economics, but amazingly few people ever grasp it. <br>  <br>  Here is how employment works. You do something that adds value to the company, either directly or indirectly. The value you add to the company is X dollars. Out of X comes the company's costs for keeping you employed (rent on your office, your computer, your chair, etc.) their profit, and your sallary. Out of your sallary comes social security taxes, state income taxes, federal income taxes, FICA, etc. <br>  You get to keep the rest. <br>  <br>  The way you make more money is by being able to add more value to the company. It has NOTHING to do with how hard you work...it is all about how much value you add, and how unique your skill is. <br>  <br>  For example ball players get bazillons of dollars a year not becaue they work harder than guys who slop hot tar on roofs for $10 an hour, but because a good ball player has a unique skill that will add bazillons of dollars to a teams bottom line. People will pay to see him play, either directly, (by buying tickets) or indirectly (by watching in TV, which drives up the ratings, which means the advertisers pay more to the TV network, which means the TV network pays more to the team). Either way, he pays for himself.<br>  <br>  So I'm not saying you should go try and play centerfield for the yankees, but you DO need to go learn a marketable skill.  Something that will help you produce more, do you can get paid more. Learn to do something that people will pay you to do. Nursing, accounting, plumbing, electrician, management.  Maybe hotel and resturant managment...though the recession is probably hitting both those industiries pretty hard right now, so that may not be a great choice. <br>  <br>  In any case, you need to make yourself more attractive to employers, and you do that by expanding your skill set.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ebxwADDcaa	get a new job...but you better set up that job beofre you quit this one because you might end up without anything. <br>  <br>  <br>  wrong category...?|`|QsbB6vkoaa	well first of all i'd go and ask qualified people who can answer because this is the religion section, so honestly i don't know what to tell you and i doubt someone will.|`|DuOl2cFXaa	Well I understand you wanting to better yourself, but at the moment times are hard, with the recession etc. So may be better staying where you are, till things improve.

aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	Luthernism arose in Germany and Scandinavia as one of three main traditions of Protestantism. The other two were Zwinglian and Calvinist (in Switzerland, France, Holland and Scotland) and the Church of England.<br>  <br>  Martin Luther had foreseen such developments and condemned them. The Book of Concord sets out what we now know as Lutheranism in 1580. It included Melanchthon's Augsburg Confession and Augsburg Apology; Luther's two catechisms and the Schmalkald Articles, and the Formula of Concord.  The doctrine of justification by faith alone is its cardinal doctrine, and this sets it apart from Catholicism. After the Thirty Years' War, the Treaty of Westphalia (1648) gave Lutherans and Calvinists equal rights with Catholics.<br>  <br>  (PS Protestants do recognise church tradition as valuable; it's just that when push comes to shove, they will opt for what the Bible actually says and only agree with church tradition that concurs with the Bible.)|`|X1jupF0paa	Catholics have a Pope|`|tBwdVpG4aa	Catholics believe that the Pope has authority handed down to him by apostolic succession from the first leader of the Church, Peter, a.k.a. Simon, a.k.a. Cephas.  He was the lead Apostle and according to Acts, the other Apostles deferred to his authority.  They also believe that there are other important documents and traditions of ancient origin that are to be taken into account when understanding doctrine.  They regard the Bible as an authoritative document perhaps more important than all these others, but one of the same kind generically.  They should know.  They compiled and edited it after all.<br>  <br>  Luther rejected the Pope and central authority from Rome.  With it he rejected the value of all those other traditions.  Lutherans have a doctrine they call "sola scriptura" which means that all teaching authority comes from the Bible alone.  All those other traditions and documents the Catholics believe are important mean nothing to them.  It's all the Bible.  That's a funny position, since it accepts the Catholic Church's major book, but rejects the process by which that document was created and the authority of those who did it to do any such thing as compile and edit the scriptures.|`|e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	I think Lutherans marry where priests can't is the main thing.

dtrYjyYZaa	a theory|`|AA11135281	As in breast and prostate self-exams?|`|JXfGHsF6aa	Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. 2 Cor. 13:5.  One's claim to manhood is determined by the use he makes of the powers that God has given him. The members of the human family are entitled to the name of men and women only as they employ their talents for the good of others. It is when ministering to others that man is most closely allied to God. He who is true to his God-given manhood will not only promote the happiness of his fellow beings in this life but will aid them to secure the reward of the life to come.<br>  <br>       Man is required to love God supremely, with his might, mind, and strength, and his neighbor as himself. This he cannot possibly do unless he denies himself. To deny self means to rule the spirit when passion is striving for the mastery; to resist the temptation to censure and to speak words of faultfinding; to have patience with the child that is dull, and whose conduct is grievous and trying; to stand at the post of duty even though others may fail; to lift responsibilities wherever and whenever duty requires, not to gain applause, not for policy, but for the sake of the Master [Jesus], who has given each of His followers a work that is to be done with unwavering fidelity. To deny self means to do good when inclination would lead us to serve and please ourselves. It means to work patiently and cheerfully for the good of others, even though our efforts may not seem to be appreciated.|`|yCdcF3Jcaa	The evaluation of one's self.|`|4HUZJdVNaa	Evaluating yourself and making sure everything is intact|`|AA11309061	evaluating yourself, wow, that was easy|`|4M2eNSb5aa	Assessing the true ability of the self in comparison to something outside the self, is self evaluation in my opinion.<br>  It is always comparative.|`|FN8meC6taa	Something that Fundies rarely do!

You should look for people who will pay the rent, be good tenants (not break things, not complain, be easy to convince that they should take care of the repairs you are responsible to fix), and good neighbors for you - in that order. While it would be nice to be surrounded by gay neighbors, as a landlord, I would go with the straight couple with good credit and references over the gay couple with poor credit and no references. I'd try to give preference to whomever would cause me the least problems as a landlord.

gOzZ3lmLaa	Generally, when referring to a car accident, Japanese people use the expression "kotsu jiko". But, this is a generic term for "traffic accident" so it doesn't always have to involve two cars. <br>  <br>  "Koutsuu jiko" is written in kanji as 交通事故. In hiragana it's written as こうつうじこ.<br>  <br>  I'm not very good a writing things phonetically in Japanese but it kinda sounds like "coatsue -g-coa(t)" (don't pronounce the final "t" sound).<br>  <br>  Besides "kuruma doushi no jiko" (車同士の事故）If you want to be more specifice then there are some other terms that can be used.<br>  <br>  "Tsuitotsu jiko" (追突事故) refers to a "rear end collision".<br>  <br>  "Shoumen shoutotsu jiko"　(正面衝突事故) refers to a "head-on collision"<br>  <br>  "Tamatsuki jiko"　(玉突き事故) refers to a pile up accident with many cars rear ending each other.<br>  BTW, "tamatsuki" can be used to refer to pool or billards, so think of an accident where all the cars (vehicles) involved  hit each other like a bunch of pool balls.<br>  <br>  "Outen jiko"　(横転事故) refers to an accident when the vehicle overturns (flips over) and rolls (lands on it's side).<br>  <br>  "Tenraku jiko" (転落事故) refers to when a vehicle,etc. runs off the road and falls off something like a bridge/cliff, etc.|`|9IrdMFX7aa	People usually use the word 交通事故 (koutsuu jiko) which means traffic accident, when they refer to a car crash.

She is frequently depicted wearing a light tunic or simply nothing at all.  I would opt for the former.  She did have with her hunting hounds, a bow and arrows, and possibly a hunting spear.  She was a deity associated with archery, the moon and hunting.  More importantly she was a Goddess of nature, and a certain purity that implies.

3e79e4e27e450434486727dbc73eaaedaa	One theologian, Harold Camping, believed that that sin was only the case for those in the days of Jesus who believed Jesus was under the power of satan.  This is blasphamy against the holy spirit.|`|AA10746669	According to The Believers Bible Commentary it is the sin of apostasy.<br>  <br>  "An apostate is one who has heard the great truths of the Christian Faith, has become intellectually convinced that Jesus is the Christ, has even made a profession of Christianity, although he has never been truly saved.  After having tasted the good things of Christianity, he completely renounces them and repudiates the Lord Jesus Christ.  In Hebrews 6 we learn that this is sin leading to death.  Those committing this sin have no way of escape, since 'they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame.'<br>  <br>  "In this entire Epistle, John has been speaking with the Gnostics in view.  These false teachers had once been in the Christian fellowship.  They had professed to be believers.  They had known the facts of the faith, but then they had turned their backs on the Lord Jesus and accepted a teaching which completely denied His deity and the sufficiency of His atoning work...."|`|JXfGHsF6aa	Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. Matt. 12:31.<br>  <br>       Whatever the sin, if the soul repents and believes, the guilt is washed away in the blood of Christ; but he who rejects the work of the Holy Spirit is placing himself where repentance and faith cannot come to him. It is by the Spirit that God works upon the heart; when men willfully reject the Spirit, and declare it to be from Satan, they cut off the channel by which God can communicate with them. When the Spirit is finally rejected, there is no more that God can do for the soul.<br>  <br>       It is not God that blinds the eyes of men or hardens their hearts. He sends them light to correct their errors, and to lead them in safe paths; it is by the rejection of this light that the eyes are blinded and the heart hardened. Often the process is gradual, and almost imperceptible. Light comes to the soul through God's word, through His servants, or by the direct agency of His Spirit; but when one ray of light is disregarded, there is a partial benumbing of the spiritual perceptions, and the second revealing of light is less clearly discerned. So the darkness increases, until it is night in the soul.<br>  <br>       It is not necessary for us deliberately to choose the service of the kingdom of darkness in order to come under its dominion. We have only to neglect to ally ourselves with the kingdom of light. . . . The most common manifestation of the sin against the Holy Spirit is in persistently slighting Heaven's invitation to repent. Every step in the rejection of Christ is a step toward the rejection of salvation, and toward the sin against the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>       When the soul surrenders itself to Christ, a new power takes possession of the new heart. A change is wrought which man can never accomplish for himself. It is a supernatural work, bringing a supernatural element into human nature. The soul that is yielded to Christ becomes His own fortress, which He holds in a revolted world, and He intends that no authority shall be known in it but His own. A soul thus kept in possession by the heavenly agencies is impregnable to the assaults of Satan.|`|6ypnDnvLaa	God will forgive you if you reject him out of some misunderstanding.<br>  (ex: the only "Christians" you've seen killed your parents.)<br>    But it is unforgivable when you know the whole story and repeatedly reject him; because you are literally refusing to be forgiven.

However, cursing and defing God would definately sadden Him, but that person still has hope.|`|UiUSsfuYaa	“A sin not leading to death” is better understood ““not punished by death.” The distinction is between sins for which death is a rapid consequence and sins for which it is not. ” The statement “sin leading to death” necessarily entails a judgment on behalf of God that leads to immediate physical death (i.e. Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5:1-6).<br>  <br>  Tthis example is brought about in order to demonstrate how necessary it is for Christian believers to intercede on behalf of others. When we pray for individuals who are caught in a specific sin that does not lead to death we can have confidence and assurance that our prayers will restore and give that person life. John’s thoughts are that prayer needs to be seen as powerful and necessary within the household of faith. This leads to question why an individual shouldn’t pray for those who may be committing sin(s) that lead to death. Zane Hodges states that John does not forbid prayers on behalf of these individuals, but we [Christians] will not have the assurance and confidence that our prayers will be answered. Believers will have to submit their prayers to the will of God.

Gv86cOvLaa	Hello, Brother.<br>  <br>  I struggled with porn—even while in full-time ministry—for over 30 years.<br>  <br>  I hate to tell you this, but accountability partners do not cure an addiction to pornography. They may help you steer clear of it, or to stick by commitments that you may make, but they won't change your heart. <br>  <br>  At its core, a dependence upon accountability to another person for your continued purity is a commitment to submit to the fear of man, which the Bible tells us is a "snare." <br>  <br>  Jesus told us that the key to freedom from the bondage to sin is the "truth." In John 8:32, He said, "you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free." If you read the context of that verse, you'll see that He is talking about freedom from the bondage to sin.<br>  <br>  Therefore, the real solution is not to find accountability partners (although it can be a good source of encouragement) but to reexamine what you currently believe... about your bondage, about sex, about nudity, about the human body, and about how a man responds to the sight of a nude woman (Hint, men aren't supposed to get aroused by the sight of a nude woman... that's a culturally conditioned response... doctors learn a different response, why can't you?).<br>  <br>  Trust me, there are things you believe right now about these issues which are absolutely false. And up until now, you've been seeking a strategy against porn while assuming that the lies are actually true. No strategy which is founded upon a lie will help you break free from that lie!<br>  <br>  One more thing... don't settle for "avoidance" as your definition of "freedom." Real freedom is not having any interest in the porn anymore. Real freedom is not even needing a filter on your computer (everyone knows that they can't keep everything out, anyway).<br>  <br>  Jesus also told us that it is not what goes into us that defiles us (what you see cannot defile you, in other words), but what comes out of us (Mark 7:15). So no matter what you manage to prevent from going into you, if you do not address what is coming out of you, you will never be completely free. And as I said before, don't settle for anything less.<br>  <br>  I know, because I'm living it. And it wasn't because of accountability, a deeper commitment, filters, strength of character, or will power. It was the fact that I learned the truth about who we are as humans, and what  God tells us about our bodies. When I embraced the truths God showed me from His Word, my interest in porn evaporated out of my life. I cannot adequately describe the difference.<br>  <br>  And it's not just me... one of my friends, another pastor, experienced the same freedom after 50 years of bondage to porn. So, we know what real freedom is. And we know why we're free now.<br>  <br>  That's why he and I (along with 4 others) have developed a website to share the truths we've learned... for people just like you who've likely never questioned beliefs like the one I challenged a few paragraphs above.<br>  <br>  I invite you to visit the site, MyChainsAreGone.org <br>  <br>  Read our stories and read the articles. It will challenge things you've never imagined to be in error before... and if you embrace the truth and live it, you'll experience the freedom that Jesus promised.<br>  <br>  See the link below. <br>  <br>  May the Lord bless you with truth that frees you.<br>  <br>  Pastor Ed|`|xd1xu3l7aa	Hello...all christian men struggle to one degree or another with sexual temptations.

v7Wflu78aa	You are correct - we use the evidence to create a model of what happened, and make predictions based on this model.  We understand that the completeness of the data, our access to the data, and our interpretations of the data are limited.<br>  <br>  Those of us who rely on the natural world as an indicator of reality - as opposed to looking to fictional accounts, or our imaginations - live knowing that our knowledge is imperfect and subject to change.<br>  <br>  I also agree that our putting "faith" in logic and "faith" in God are similar - they are built into humans evolved ability, even preference, to believe what we are told and experience.<br>  <br>  However, our culture, e.g. a food-inspection system that employs trained people to inspect food and act on their findings, with oversight that goes all the way up the chain to the cabinet, creates a version of "faith" that is not the same as religious faith, e.g.,  in Allah or Zeus.<br>  <br>  A citizen could try to calculate at each moment the chance that a piece of food is unsafe or that an approaching driver is unlicensed, but, this would make life difficult.<br>  <br>  That is why, I argue, that faith is necessary for humans to survive: We accept given truths so that our minds have the capacity for more important things.<br>  <br>  Our ability to believe without thinking - that our food is safe and that the other driver will stop for a read light - unfortunately translates into an inclination to have faith in fictions, e.g., Zeus, rain-dances, Allah, and so on.<br>  <br>  Another example, Lister told the doctors of his time that washing hands and scrubbing fingernails would  prevent patient infection.  Those doctors who believed him had "faith" in him, and those who did NOT believe him had "faith" in existing practices.<br>  <br>  But it wasn't really a matter of faith.

Often they mean proof beyond reasonable doubt.<br>  <br>  In the case of evolution, we can say that the basic principle (if not the precise details) are proven beyond reasonable doubt. It's always possible that some malevolent force has planted false evidence, or that our reliance on logic suffers some unseen flaw, but such scenarios are so unlikely that it is not reasonable to invoke them.|`|QJkypmrWaa	No that can't be used as a reason to claim evolution because you haven't even given us a concrete (not to mention clear) reason as to disprove evolution, you're just talking about the probability of the cup falling over, you need some REAL evidence to disprove a scientific theory|`|py57svUyaa	You forgot to mention that when I left the kitchen I left half drank cup with juice on the counter standing and a cat sleeping on the sofa.|`|WFvZoqc1aa	but science (evolution) is proven|`|iY6GQsRUaa	You did not think that up.

Whereas evidence is composed of observations made directly through our senses, or indirectly by conversion into something that can be detected directly through our senses.<br>  <br>  You cannot detect radio waves (EMF), for example.  But radio waves can be translated into light waves and sound waves which you can detect.  Do you accept that your television is displaying the 'correct' signal compared to how it left the studio?  Is that faith?  Or is the evidence close enough for you to accept it?  (Actually there is more to the signal that your TV shows you normally, but that is a whole other story.)<br>  <br>  Did I read your question on the Internet?  Did my monitor display the same letters you typed?  Do you even exist?  Or is it all in my imagination?  There is no 'proof' that can determine that you exist or that the Internet exists.  There is however 'evidence' as far as my senses can determine.  Of course they could be wrong or drastically distorted (that is where the 'proofed' beverages come in).<br>  <br>  Your reasoning leads you down a single road: that you can never be sure that anything is true or that anything exists.  Including yourself.  The best you can ever do is to collect enough evidence to convince yourself.  How much is enough?  Your call.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, as for the spill: the cat did it.

No hubo ningún momento en mi vida en el cual me pusiera a pensar ?quiero que me gusten los hombres o las mujeres?, nunca elejí. Si hubo un momento en mi vida en el que me pregunte ?me gustan los hombres o las mujeres?, es decir, ME DI CUENTA, PERO NUNCA ELEJI. De echo no estoy contento con esto que siento y estoy tratando de cambiarlo (perdón si algún gay se ofende por esto, pero es lo que quiero y deben respetar mi opinión). Creo que debo aceptarlo antes de poder sanarme, al igual que un alcoholico o drogadicto debe primero aceptar su problema para luego poder superarlo.<br>  Hay muchas teorías de porque uno es homosexual, basadas en el análisis estadístico de casos, es decir, agarran un grupo de homosexuales y tratan de ver que cosas tienen en común (en cuanto a su personalidad, experiencias de vida, entorno social, etc), y se sabe, estadísticamente, de que un gran número de homosexuales sufrieron algún trauma en su ni?es como abuso sexual o ausencia del padre en el hombre homosexual o de la madre en la mujer homosexual. Y después a partir de los datos estadísticos se tratan de elavorar teorías, como que por ejemplo el hombre homosexual, que no contó con su padre en la ni?es, trata de buscar el amor de otros hombres. Pero como verás no hay verificación de que ninguna de esas teorías sean verdaderas a ciencia cierta, por eso son solo teorías.<br>  Lo único seguro para mi es que soy gay y no tengo ni idea de porque lo soy, y de que quiero dejar de serlo, pero es muy dificil, es decir, camino por la calle y veo un hombre lindo y me siento atraido, no se puede controlar eso, es algo que viene de adento.

Es en esta zona donde supuestamente se hundio la legendaria "Atlantida" de Platon. Los antiguos Atlantes utilizaban enormes cristales como Fuentes de Poder y psíquicos alrededor del mundo sostienen la teoria de que estos poderosos cristales sumergidos desde hace mas de 10,000 a?os, son la causa de los extra?os fenómenos que suceden en esta asolada zona del océano.<br>  <br>  Lo cierto es que muchas de las desapariciones y sucesos misteriosos que se llevan a cabo en el Triangulo, son atribuidos a una extra?a Fuerza Magnetica que afecta Brujulas, Computadoras y casi a cualquier tipo de Equipo Electrónico de comunicación y navegación.<br>  <br>  En 1983, la revista "Newsweek" especuló sobre la posibilidad de que en el fondo del océano, reposaba una gigantesca pirámide, que emitia Fuerzas Electromagnéticas, causante de las tragedias y desapariciones.

Este lugar, llamado también "Triángulo del Diablo" o "Limbo de los Perdidos" ha sido y es testigo de fenómenos sin explicación que han recorrido el mundo. <br>  <br>  El triángulo de las Bermudas, como su nombre indica, es un espacio con forma triangular comprendido entre la Península de Florida, la isla de Puerto Rico y el archipiélago de las Bermudas. La denominación de "Triángulo de las Bermudas" es relativamente reciente, ya que la empleó por primera vez en 1964 el periodista norteamericano Vicente Gaddis. No obstante, el misterio se remonta desde hace mucho tiempo, y ya los marinos conocían a esa zona como "El Limbo de los Perdidos", una extensión del Mar de los Sargazos, donde las brújulas se vuelven locas y los más modernos aparatos de navegación no responden. Cristóbal Colón ya hacía referencia a cuerpos extra?os vistos en la zona como luces en el horizonte durante sus viajes por el mar Caribe.<br>  <br>  <br>  Aunque desde mediados del siglo XIX han desaparecido más de 50 barcos y 20 aviones, uno de los casos más significativos fue el del vuelo 19: cinco bombarderos estadounidenses tipo torpedo abandonaron Fort Lauderdale el 5 de diciembre de 1945 en un vuelo de entrenamiento rutinario y con buenas condiciones metereológicas. Ninguno volvió y tampoco el hidroavión que se envió a buscarlo. También son numerosos los casos de barcos encontrados abandonados con la comida aún caliente en las mesas y aviones que desaparecen sin haber dado ninguna se?ales de socorro, y todo sin haber encontrado ningún resto.<br>  Muchas son las teorías que existen al respecto y que tratan de esclarecer los hechos, por una parte, varios científicos aseguran que la mayoría de las desapariciones han ocurrido fuera de los límites del triángulo y que la ausencia de cuerpos, aviones y barcos se debe a la profundidad de las aguas; por otro lado, hay quienes alegan la existencia de un campo electromagnético proveniente de la Tierra que explicaría el no funcionamiento de las brújulas y el instrumental de vuelo. Otras teorías menos científicas aseguran que las desapariciones se deben a la existencia de una base extraterrestre o a la posibilidad de un agujero espacial/temporal, o que se debe a la legendaria y antigua civilización de la Atlántida, sepultada bajo el mar, con tecnología mucho más avanzada que la nuestra y de la que ya Platón nos constató de su existencia en algunos de sus escritos. <br>  <br>   <br>  Desapariciones en las Bermudas, entre ellas:<br>  <br>  La del navío Mary Celeste el 1872. <br>  El 1947 se perdió contacto de forma definitiva con un C-45 Superfort del ejército norteamericano a 100 millas de las islas Bermudas. <br>  El a?o 1948, de un cuatrimotor Tudor IV civil con 31 pasajeros a bordo. <br>  El mismo a?o, un DC-3 fue perdido con 32 pasajeros y toda su tripulación. <br>  El 1949 desapareció el segundo avión Tudor IV. <br>  El 1950 barco americano S.S. Sandra (de 350 pies) se perdió sin dejar rastro. <br>  El 1952 el avión de transporte de pasajeros británico York desapareció con sus 33 pasajeros. <br>  El navío de la armada norteamericana Constelation, el 1954, con sus 42 tripulantes. <br>  Dos a?os después, el hidroavión Martín P5M, con 10 tripulantes a bordo. <br>  El 1963, el barco Reina del Sulpher, también sin dejar rastro. <br>  El 1967, el carguero militar YC-122. <br>  El 1970, el fletador francés Milton latrides. <br>  El 1972, el barco alemán Anita (de 20.000 toneladas), con 32 tripulantes. <br>  El 1997, desaparecieron todos los pasajeros de un yate alemán.|`|3caf431a029e8e3360a3ca43b2a9102aaa	que avión o barco que pasa por el triángulo desaparece como si se lo llevaran los extraterrestre|`|447d241e60d02c3babfa65099c90b9fbaa	MITOLOGICAMENTE HABLANDO HAY MUCHAS POSIBILIDADES, PUES SE DICE DE EXTRATERRESTRES, LA ATLANTIDA, FANTASMAS, ETC.

La biblioteca personal de cualquier entusiasta casi seguramente incluía un buen número de libros, la mayoría de ellos ediciones rústicas, acerca de los misterios del mar: buques desvanecidos, objetos no identificados saliendo del mar, y la posibilidad de que la mítica Atlántida aún estuviese activa bajo las olas del Atlántico después de miles de a?os. <br>  <br>  Autores como Charles Berlitz, Richard Winer y John Wallace Spencer se convirtieron en los máximos exponentes de la realidad de la figura geométrica en el agua que devoraba aparatos hechos por el hombre sin dejar rastro de ellos. Otros autores se vieron obligados a pescar misterios en otros mares: algunos, como Jay Gourley, los encontraron en el Lago Ontario, cuyas anomalías magnéticas siguen siendo una realidad hasta el presente; otros como Kevin Killey echaron sus redes en el "Meridiano del Diablo" cerca de la australiana isla de Tasmania.<br>  <br>  Pero con el paso de los a?os, y la aparición de nuevas obras investigativas como la de Lawrence David Kusche, que apuntaban hacia un origen mundano de las desapariciones, o al hecho de que muchas de las embarcaciones jamás existieron, el interés por el Triángulo de las Bermudas comenzó a menguar, o al menos dejó de ser una fascinación para la nueva generación de fanáticos de lo paranormal. No obstante, todavía existe una cantidad de eventos sin explicar que tienen su origen en las aguas del Atlántico - eventos que jamás han sido incluidos en los libros que tratan sobre el tema.<br>  <br>  "Atención, les habla el capitán..."<br>  <br>  El 11 de junio de 1998, el vuelo 1844 de la US Airways con destino a Filadelfia desde San Juan de Puerto Rico, se encontró con una turbulencia considerable en pleno vuelo: una perturbación lo suficientemente fuerte como para suspender el servicio de bebidas y comida inmediatamente. El capitán se disculpó profusamente con los pasajeros, indicando que el aparato se encontraba "fuera del alcance de cualquier radar basado en tierra" y por consiguiente, no podía solicitar el cambio a una menor elevación. Mientras que el Boeing 737 seguía siendo juguete de las corrientes de aire, algunos pasajeros comentaron abiertamente sobre el Triángulo de las Bermudas, omitiendo las consecuencias sufridas por los aviones que entran en dicha zona. Después de varias horas, la turbulencia se redujo y el avión llegó a su destino sin percances. La turbulencia y los bolsones de aire pueden resultar atemorizantes, pero los viajes que parecen carecer de incidentes pueden ser igual de espeluznantes, como veremos a continuación:<br>   <br>    El ejemplar de la revista Pursuit de julio de 1973 incluyó un caso bastante dramático narrado por Robert J. Durant, conocido por sus pesquisas ufológicas. Durant entrevistó a un piloto que volaba el trayecto entre la ciudad de Nueva York y San Juan de manera rutinaria, acostumbrado a los disturbios que suelen producirse en la zona y que en ocasiones han sido lo suficientemente fuertes como para arrojar a los pasajeros de un lado de la cabina al otro. En este caso, el piloto dijo que sus oficiales y la tripulación habían comentado sobre la tranquilidad del vuelo. <br>  Pero poco después de haberse producido el comentario, destellos de electricidad estática de color violáceo <br>  El pasajero promedio con la suerte de conseguir un asiento de ventanilla en un vuelo comercial api?ado tiene a veces más cosas que ver por la ventana que los cielos de color azul irreal y nubes blancas que se extienden hasta el infinito.|`|7970e78d6667d820d0b6e0ac1452f520aa	ES UNA REGIóN QUE SE ENCUENTRA EN EL CARIBE Y EN DONDE DESPARECEN LOS BARCOS Y AVIONES CADA VEZ QUE ATRAVIESAN ESA ZONA, ADEMáS TODOS LOS INSTRUMENTOS DEJAN DE FUNCIONAR.|`|aeb2b53df42b6a0cb1ff9228589844a4aa	no funciona nada electronico dentro de este triangulo y dicen que si entras nunca sales, al menos nadie lo ha hecho|`|d19dba02ec4f3c29a45d8b0319a756c2aa	Es una mera leyenda, te lo aseguro.

El amor, el verdadero amor, es un *sentimiento mutuo* que se produce como resultado de la vivencia de un cierto número de experiencias a través de las cuales las personas involucradas han aprendido a aceptar al otro tal cual como una forma de lograr sus propias aspiraciones en la vida. El amor, en consecuencia, no es algo propio, sino algo común.

Up to the point where he couldn't breath and his lips turning blue. He probably would of died, if I didn't grab him and started praying.  So, they are real. when your hair stands up on the back of your neck and your cold for no reason, then they are near.|`|3d6a69991dcc850aac98b934575f286eaa	Real- yes.  Visual- not in the ways you would think. hurt us- yes.  Obviously you won't see it but they can hit you and cause a lot of problems in your life.  But there are limits and rules for everyone to follow.|`|92e396e8c6a8cde86ba2081a5209a0f8aa	Spirits are real.  You can see them, they can see you (if you're in that situation).  I think the evil ones can posses/hurt you if you invite them in.  I've seen a spirit but do not know if it was good or evil?   It walked by me and I sighed because I was scared, it apparently startled the ghost/spirit as it looked like I scared it.  When the spirit heard me, it turned really quick and faced me then walked into a wall.  <br>  <br>  Years later I found out that the wall it walked into used to be a room.  My house was like 100 yrs old.  I saw it one other time since then and always heard it walking in my attic room.  It knocked my atheist uncle off a chair when he was in the house by himself smoking in my mother's kitchen (she's asthmatic).  He's never been back to our house.|`|UI4DW5UMaa	i think they're real. when wierd stuff happens it's not always a coincidence. but i don't think they're here to hurt us. probably some unfinished buisness to complete before they move on!!|`|cAfPrs81aa	i believe that it is on the eye of the beholder. and how big of an imatition the beholder has. do i believe that they are real? well no not realy. but that is me. it is what you beleive.|`|lSyBbdajaa	Spirits are real, and yes they can cause hurt.

Did it occur to you that by asking that, you are essentially getting in other people's business?  I honestly find this funny, as I really love ironic situations.  <br>  <br>  Ok, I think it has to do with one of two things.  One thing is, people do care about other people and want to lend a hand at times.  The more likely thing is that people want to see that someone else has it worse than they do and they get to gossip about it afterward.|`|95a054862f66114bc2215248c4e68b98aa	Because minding other people's business has some evolutionary advantage.|`|AA10389378	This can be for several reasons, but largely for the same reasons bullying occurs in schools, name calling occurs on the playground and family infighting occurs just prior to Thanksgiving. <br>  <br>  The common demoninator here is people who are in other's people's business largely can't take care of themselves and their own issues, and repress their lack of self esteem by pointing their fingers at others. <br>  <br>  This of course gives way to the anecdote, "Point one finger at me, three are pointing back to you."<br>  <br>  The best way to deal with people like these is to use "I" statements, like, "It makes me feel bad when you treat me such and such way." or  by asking the indictive persons to be put in your shoes, and asking how they would feel in the same situation.|`|H8RcS1esaa	They have no work to do.|`|znlaJZFTaa	People like to mind other people's business because they have no life of their own and look to other people to keep them entertained.

041e6252efb55962f9628b5aef9cc230aa	Eu participo há bastante tempo da Doutrina Espírita e posso te falar que é ótimo! E aqui trouxe um resumo da prática espírita para todos os que quiserem conhecer melhor essa Doutrina que traz tantos benefícios para todas as pessoas:<br>  <br>  O que é o Espiritismo<br>  <br>  é o conjunto de princípios e leis, revelados pelos Espíritos Superiores, contidos nas obras de Allan Kardec, que constituem a Codifica??o Espírita: O Livro dos Espíritos, O Livro dos Médiuns, O Evangelho Segundo o Espiritismo, O Céu e o Inferno e A Gênese.<br>  <br>  é o Consolador prometido, que veio, no devido tempo, recordar e complementar o que Jesus ensinou, "restabelecendo todas as coisas no seu verdadeiro sentido", trazendo, assim, à Humanidade as bases reais para sua espiritualiza??o.<br>  <br>  O que revela<br>  <br>  Revela conceitos novos e mais aprofundados a respeito de Deus, do Universo, dos Homens, dos Espíritos e das Leis que regem a vida.<br>  <br>  Revela, ainda, o que somos, de onde viemos, para onde vamos, qual o objetivo da existência terrena e qual a raz?o da dor e do sofrimento.<br>  <br>  Qual a sua abrangência<br>  <br>  Trazendo conceitos novos sobre o homem e tudo o que o cerca, o Espiritismo toca em todas as áreas do conhecimento, das atividades e do comportamento humanos.<br>  <br>  Pode e deve ser estudado, analisado e praticado em todos os aspectos fundamentais da vida, tais como: científico, filosófico, religioso, ético, moral, educacional, social.<br>  <br>  Pontos fundamentais<br>  <br>  Deus é a inteligência suprema e causa primária de todas as coisas. é eterno, imutável, imaterial, único, onipotente, soberanamente justo e bom.<br>  <br>  O Universo é cria??o de Deus. Abrange todos os seres racionais e irracionais, animados e inanimados, materiais e imateriais.<br>  <br>  Além do mundo corporal, habita??o dos Espíritos encarnados (Homens), existe o mundo espiritual, habita??o dos Espíritos desencarnados.<br>  <br>  No Universo há outros mundos habitados, com seres de diferentes graus de evolu??o: iguais, mais evoluídos e menos evoluídos que os homens.<br>  <br>  Todas as leis da Natureza s?o leis divinas, pois que Deus é o seu autor. Abrangem tanto as leis físicas como as leis morais.<br>  <br>  O homem é um Espírito encarnado em um corpo material. O perispírito é o corpo semimaterial que une o Espírito ao corpo material.<br>  <br>  Os Espíritos s?o os seres inteligentes da cria??o. Constituem o mundo dos Espíritos, que preexiste e sobrevive a tudo.<br>  <br>  Os Espíritos s?o criados simples e ignorantes, evoluem intelectual e moralmente, passando de uma ordem inferior para outra mais elevada, até a perfei??o, onde gozam de inalterável felicidade.<br>  <br>  Os Espíritos preservam sua individualidade, antes, durante e depois de cada encarna??o.<br>  <br>  Os Espíritos reencarnam tantas vezes quantas forem necessárias ao seu próprio aprimoramento.<br>  <br>  Os Espíritos evoluem sempre. Em suas múltiplas existências corpóreas podem estacionar, mas nunca regridem. A rapidez do seu progresso, intelectual e moral, depende dos esfor?os que fa?a para chegar à perfei??o.<br>  <br>  Os Espíritos pertencem a diferentes ordens, conforme o grau de perfei??o a que tenham alcan?ado: Espíritos Puros, que atingiram a perfei??o máxima; Bons Espíritos, nos quais o desejo do bem é o que predomina; Espíritos imperfeitos, caracterizados pela ignorancia, pelo desejo do mal e pelas paix?es inferiores.<br>  <br>  As rela??es dos Espíritos com os homens s?o constantes, e sempre existiram. Os bons Espíritos nos atraem para o bem, nos sustentam nas provas da vida e nos ajudam a suportá-las com coragem e resigna??o. Os imperfeitos nos impelem para o mal. Jesus é o guia e modelo para toda a Humanidade. E a Doutrina que ensinou e exemplificou é a express?o mais pura da Lei de Deus.<br>  <br>  A moral do Cristo, contida no Evangelho, é o roteiro para a evolu??o segura de todos os homens, e a sua prática é a solu??o para todos os problemas humanos e o objetivo a ser atingido pela humanidade.<br>  <br>  O homem tem o livre-arbítrio para agir, mas responde pelas conseqüências de suas a??es.<br>  <br>  A vida futura reserva aos homens penas e gozos compatíveis com o procedimento de respeito ou n?o à Lei de Deus.<br>  <br>  A prece é um ato de adora??o a Deus. Está na lei natural, e é o resultado de um sentimento inato do homem, assim como é inata a idéia da existência do Criador.<br>  A prece torna melhor o homem. Aquele que ora com fervor e confian?a se faz mais forte contra as tenta??es do mal e Deus lhe envia bons Espíritos para assistí-lo. é este um socorro que jamais se lhe recusa, quando pedido com sinceridade.<br>  <br>  Prática Espírita<br>  <br>  Toda a prática espírita é gratuita, dentro do princípio do Evangelho: "Dai de gra?a o que de gra?a recebestes".<br>  <br>  A prática espírita é realizada sem nenhum culto exterior, dentro do princípio crist?o de que Deus deve ser adorado em espírito e verdade.<br>  <br>  O Espiritismo n?o tem corpo sacerdotal e n?o adota e nem usa em suas reuni?es e em suas práticas: paramentos, bebidas alcóolicas, incenso, fumo, altares, imagens, andores, velas, prociss?es, talism?s, amuletos, sacramentos, concess?es de indugência, horóscopos, cartomancia, piramides, cristais, búzios, rituais, ou quaisquer outras formas de culto exterior.<br>  <br>  O Espiritismo n?o imp?e os seus princípios. Convida os interessados em conhecé-lo a submeter os seus ensinos ao crivo da raz?o antes de aceitá-los.<br>  <br>  A mediunidade, que permite a comunica??o dos Espíritos com os homens, é um dom que muitas pessoas trazem consigo ao nascer, independentemente da diretriz doutrinária de vida que adote.<br>  <br>  Prática mediúnica espírita só é aquela que é exercida com base nos princípios da Doutrina Espírita e dentro da moral crist?.<br>  <br>  O Espiritismo respeita todas as religi?es, valoriza todos os esfor?os para a prática do bem, trabalha pela confraterniza??o entre todos os homens independentemente de sua ra?a, cor, nacionalidade, cren?a ou nível cultural e social, e reconhece que "o verdadeiro homem de bem é o que cumpre a lei de justi?a, de amor e de caridade, na sua maior pureza".<br>  <br>  "Nascer, morrer, renascer, ainda, e progredir sempre, tal é a lei."<br>  <br>  "Fé inabalável só o é a que pode encarar frente a frente a raz?o, em todas as épocas da Humanidade".<br>  <br>  "Fora da caridade n?o há salva??o".<br>  <br>  O estudo das obras de Allan Kardec é fundamental para o correto conhecimento da Doutrina Espírita.|`|AA12005596	Sou Umbandista. <br>  <a href="http://www.umbanda.host.sk/pdf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.umbanda.host.sk/pdf.html</a>|`|71c4361bf415a7d7a5b6caa958dd61e9aa	EM NENHUMA IGREJA !

Em rela??o a sua pergunta, com certeza vc merece respeito, mas o homem em si, ele n?o procura respeitar os seus semelhantes, se o homem n?o respeita nem o meio ambiente do qual ele vive e precisa para sobreviver, será se respeitaria uma pessoa que ao menos conhece e diga-se de passagem, nem precisa? Acredito que há algum motivo pelo qual vc é agnóstico-ateísta, assim como há um motivo para que uma pessoa escolha uma determinada filosofia de vida, pois, o melhor professor do homem é a própria vida. é ela que se encarrega de ensinar e dar a li??o de vida para o homem e é a partir daí que o homem escolhe no que acreditar ou n?o. Eu, por exemplo, tenho a minha experiência de vida, acredito em Deus, pois, tenho experiência com Ele assim como tenho provas de sua existência e sua rela??o com minha vida. Da mesma forma acredito que vc tem a sua própria experiência de vida para ser ateísta, pois, para tudo há o seu tempo, tudo acontece no momento certo, e se vc tem uma determinada opini?o é porque vc tem um motivo e tem uma experiência de vida. é, por isso, que respeito a sua opini?o porque gosto de fazer com os outros o que eu gostaria de que fizessem comigo.

Segundo a lenda constante nesses manifestos, teria sido fundada por Christian Rosenkreuz, peregrino do século XV; no entanto, a assun??o desta data??o é discutível devido ao simbolismo e hermeticismo do conteúdo dos manifestos, principalmente nos aspectos numéricos e nas concep??es geométricas apresentadas.<br>  <br>  Enquanto que, por um lado, alguns metafísicos consideram que a Ordem Rosacruz pode ser compreendida, de um ponto de vista mais amplo, como parte, ou inclusive a fonte, da corrente de pensamento hermético-crist? patente no período dos tratados ocidentais de alquimia que se segue à publica??o de "A Divina Comédia" de Dante (1308-1321); por outro lado, alguns historiadores sugerem a sua origem num grupo de protestantes alem?es, entre 1607 ou 1616, quando três textos an?nimos foram elaborados e lan?ados na Europa: Fama Fraternitatis R.C., Confessio Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis e Núpcias Alquímicas de Christian Rozenkreuz Ano 1459. A influência desses textos foi t?o grande que a historiadora Frances Yates denominou este período do século XVII como o período do Iluminismo Rosacruz.<br>  <br>  O Emblema Rosacruz, embora com varia??es, apresenta-se sempre como uma cruz envolvida por uma coroa de rosas, ou com uma rosa ao centro.<br>  <br>  Outra faceta da Rosa-cruz mais conhecida é o 18o Grau (representando simbolicamente a 9a Inicia??o Menor), o grau de "Cavaleiro Rosa-Cruz", do "Capítulo da Rosa-Cruz" do "Rito Escocês Antigo e Aceito" da Franco-Ma?onaria, que tem como símbolos principais o Pelicano, a Rosa e a Cruz.<br>  <br>  Diversos livres pensadores defendem que o Rosacrucianismo n?o é mais do que uma Ordem constituída mas, uma corrente de pensamento, cuja filia??o ocorre pela ado??o de certas posturas de vida.|`|af727dd62f75a2db25770fd422de9d0caa	só hoje tou ouvir essa palavra, gra?as a ti|`|7b633cc4c12251ccf0f9cf507dca19c4aa	é uma associa??o espírita..|`|ZlzmrG3Qaa	é uma sociedade secreta estilo Ma?onaria, com a diferen?a q aceita mulheres como membros.<br>  <br>  é mais ou menos isso.

No entanto, pensando na simplicidade de suas palavras, vemos nelas a integra??o de nós com a Divindade. Nós estamos no Pai e o Pai está em nós. Ele nos dá o p?o, nos dá a vida.

Pouco antes de ensinar essa ora??o, Jesus disse: “Ao orares, n?o digas as mesmas coisas vez após vez, assim como fazem os das na??es, pois imaginam que ser?o ouvidos por usarem de muitas palavras.” —?Mateus 6:7.<br>  <br>  Portanto, é evidente que Jesus n?o pretendia que a ora??o do Pai-Nosso fosse repetida palavra por palavra. é verdade que, mais tarde, ele repetiu essa ora??o para que outros também a aprendessem. (Lucas 11:2-4) Mas a fraseologia da ora??o no relato evangélico de Mateus difere um pouco da do evangelho de Lucas. Além disso, outras ora??es que Jesus e os seus discípulos fizeram posteriormente n?o seguiram rigidamente as palavras da ora??o-modelo.<br>  <br>  Por que o Pai-Nosso foi registrado na Bíblia? Por meio desse modelo, Jesus nos ensinou como nossas ora??es podem tornar-se aceitáveis para Deus. Nessa ora??o, encontramos também respostas a algumas das perguntas básicas sobre a vida. Portanto, consideremos cada parte do Pai-Nosso.<br>  <br>  Qual é o nome de Deus?<br>  <br>  “Nosso Pai nos céus, santificado seja o teu nome.” (Mateus 6:9) Essas palavras iniciais da ora??o-modelo nos ajudam a nos achegar a Deus por nos dirigirmos a ele como “nosso Pai”. Assim como uma crian?a, que por natureza se sente atraída a seu pai amoroso e compreensivo, podemos achegar-nos ao nosso Pai celestial, confiantes de que ele quer nos ouvir. “ó Ouvinte de ora??o”, cantou o Rei Davi, “sim, a ti chegar?o pessoas de toda carne”. —?Salmo 65:2.<br>  <br>  Jesus nos ensinou a orar a Deus pedindo que santifique, ou torne santo, o Seu nome. Mas qual é o nome de Deus? A Bíblia responde com as seguintes palavras: “Tu, cujo nome é Jeová, somente tu és o Altíssimo sobre toda a terra.” (Salmo 83:18) Já leu alguma vez o nome Jeová na sua Bíblia?<br>  <br>  Realmente, o nome de Deus, Jeová, ocorre quase 7.000 vezes nos antigos manuscritos bíblicos. No entanto, alguns tradutores foram a ponto de remover esse nome das suas vers?es da Bíblia. Portanto, é correto orarmos que o Criador santifique o seu nome, ou o torne santo. (Ezequiel 36:23) Um modo de agir em harmonia com essa ora??o é usarmos o nome Jeová quando oramos a Deus.<br>  <br>  Uma senhora chamada Patrícia, que foi criada como católica, conhecia muito bem o Pai-Nosso. Como reagiu quando uma Testemunha de Jeová lhe mostrou na Bíblia o nome de Deus? “Nem podia acreditar no que eu estava ouvindo!” exclamou. “De modo que fui pegar a minha própria vers?o da Bíblia, e nela também constava o nome de Deus. A Testemunha me mostrou ent?o Mateus 6:9, 10, e explicou que o nome de Deus está relacionado com o Pai-Nosso. Fiquei muito interessada e pedi que ela estudasse a Bíblia comigo.”<br>  <br>  A vontade de Deus será realizada na Terra<br>  <br>  “Venha o teu reino. Realize-se a tua vontade, como no céu, assim também na terra.” (Mateus 6:9, 10) Como se cumprirá essa parte da ora??o-modelo de Jesus? A maioria das pessoas imagina que o céu seja um lugar de paz e de tranqüilidade. As Escrituras referem-se ao céu como “morada excelsa de santidade e beleza” de Jeová. (Isaías 63:15) N?o é de admirar que oremos que a vontade de Deus seja realizada na Terra assim “como no céu”! Mas será que isso acontecerá algum dia?<br>  <br>  Daniel, profeta de Jeová, predisse: “O Deus do céu estabelecerá um reino que jamais será arruinado. E o próprio reino n?o passará a qualquer outro povo. Esmiu?ará e porá termo a todos estes reinos [terrestres], e ele mesmo ficará estabelecido por tempos indefinidos.” (Daniel 2:44) Esse reino, ou governo, celestial agirá dentro em breve para trazer paz global por meio de um governo justo. —?2?Pedro 3:13.<br>  <br>  Orar pela vinda do Reino de Deus e para que a Sua vontade seja feita na Terra é uma manifesta??o de fé, que n?o trará desapontamento. Jo?o, o apóstolo crist?o, escreveu: “Ouvi uma voz alta do trono dizer: ‘Eis que a tenda de Deus está com a humanidade, e ele residirá com eles e eles ser?o os seus povos. E o próprio Deus estará com eles. E enxugará dos seus olhos toda lágrima, e n?o haverá mais morte, nem haverá mais pranto, nem clamor, nem dor. As coisas anteriores já passaram.’?” Depois Jo?o acrescentou: “Escreve, porque estas palavras s?o fiéis e verdadeiras.” —?Revela??o (Apocalipse) 21:3-5.<br>  <br>  Orar pelas necessidades materiais<br>  <br>  Na ora??o-modelo, Jesus mostrou que a nossa preocupa??o primária deve estar relacionada com o nome e a vontade de Deus. No entanto, a ora??o-modelo prossegue com pedidos pessoais, feitos corretamente a Jeová.<br>  <br>  O primeiro deles?é: “Dá-nos hoje o nosso p?o para este dia.” (Mateus 6:11) Isso n?o é um pedido de riqueza material. Jesus incentivou-nos a orar pelo “nosso p?o para o dia, segundo as exigências do dia”. (Lucas 11:3) Em harmonia com o Pai-Nosso, podemos orar com fé que Deus providencie as nossas necessidades diárias, se o amarmos e lhe obedecermos.<br>  <br>  Ficarmos indevidamente ansiosos por causa de problemas econ?micos poderia fazer-nos descuidar da nossa necessidade espiritual e assim n?o fazermos o que Deus espera de nós. Mas, se na vida dermos prioridade à adora??o a Deus, poderemos ter certeza de que nossos pedidos para as necessidades materiais, tais como alimento e roupa, ser?o ouvidos favoravelmente. Jesus disse: “Persisti ?.?.?. em buscar primeiro o reino [de Deus] e a Sua justi?a, e todas estas outras coisas vos ser?o acrescentadas.” (Mateus 6:26-33) Buscar a justi?a de Deus é um desafio, visto que todos nós somos pecaminosos e precisamos de perd?o. (Romanos 5:12) O Pai-Nosso também trata desse assunto.<br>  <br>  Nossas ora??es e o perd?o<br>  <br>  “Perdoa-nos as nossas dívidas, assim como nós também temos perdoado aos nossos devedores.” (Mateus 6:12) No registro que Lucas fez do Pai-Nosso, essas “dívidas” se referem aos “pecados”. (Lucas 11:4) Será que Jeová realmente perdoará os nossos pecados?<br>  <br>  Embora o Rei Davi, do Israel antigo, tivesse cometido sérios pecados, ele estava arrependido e orou com confian?a: “Tu, ó Jeová, és bom e estás pronto a perdoar; e é abundante a benevolência para com todos os que te invocam.” (Salmo 86:5) Que idéia consoladora! Nosso Pai celestial está “pronto a perdoar” os pecados dos que o invocam arrependidos. Com a mesma certeza de que uma dívida pode ser totalmente cancelada, da mesma forma Jeová Deus pode perdoar completamente os nossos pecados.<br>  <br>  No entanto, Jesus mencionou uma condi??o: para sermos perdoados por Deus temos de perdoar os outros. (Mateus 6:14, 15) Embora o justo Jó tenha sido maltratado por três amigos, ele os perdoou e até orou por eles. (?Jó 42:10) Se perdoarmos os que pecam contra nós, agradaremos a Deus e estaremos na condi??o de ser beneficiados pela misericórdia dele.<br>  <br>  A disposi??o de Deus de ouvir as nossas peti??es deve induzir-nos a procurar a sua aprova??o. E podemos fazer isso, embora sejamos imperfeitos. (Mateus 26:41) Também nesse ponto Jeová pode ajudar-nos, conforme Jesus mostrou no importante pedido que conclui a ora??o-modelo.<br>  <br>  Pedir ajuda para adotar um proceder justo<br>  <br>  “N?o nos leves à tenta??o, mas livra-nos do iníquo.” (Mateus 6:13) Jeová n?o nos abandona numa tenta??o, nem nos faz cair no pecado. Sua Palavra declara: “Por coisas más, Deus n?o pode ser provado, nem prova ele a alguém.” (Tiago 1:13) Deus permite que sejamos tentados, mas ele pode livrar-nos do Grande Tentador —?o “iníquo”, conhecido como Satanás, o Diabo.<br>  <br>  O apóstolo Pedro aconselhou os seus irm?os: “Mantende os vossos sentidos, sede vigilantes. Vosso adversário, o Diabo, anda em volta como le?o que ruge, procurando a quem devorar.” (1?Pedro 5:8) De fato, Satanás tentou até mesmo o homem perfeito Jesus Cristo! Qual era o objetivo do Diabo? Desviar Jesus da adora??o pura de Jeová Deus. (Mateus 4:1-11) Se você está procurando servir a Deus, o objetivo de Satanás é devorá-lo também!<br>  <br>  Por meio do mundo que está sob o seu controle, o Diabo pode nos tentar a praticar coisas que Deus desaprova. (1?Jo?o 5:19) Por isso é vital que recorramos regularmente a Deus em busca de ajuda, especialmente quando nos confrontamos com uma tenta??o persistente. E se adorarmos a Jeová segundo a sua Palavra inspirada, a Bíblia, ele nos libertará por ajudar-nos a resistir ao Diabo. “Deus é fiel”, nos diz a Bíblia, “e ele n?o deixará que sejais tentados além daquilo que podeis agüentar”. —?1?Coríntios 10:13.<br>  <br>  é essencial termos fé em Deus<br>  <br>  Como é animador saber que o nosso Pai celestial está interessado em cada um de nós! Até mesmo providenciou que seu Filho, Jesus Cristo, nos ensinasse a orar. Isso certamente nos motiva a querer agradar a Jeová Deus. Como podemos fazer isso?<br>  <br>  A Bíblia declara: “Sem fé é impossível agradar-lhe bem, pois aquele que se aproxima de Deus tem de crer que ele existe e que se torna o recompensador dos que seriamente o buscam.” (Hebreus 11:6) Como se consegue ter essa fé? “A fé segue à coisa ouvida”, diz a Bíblia. (Romanos 10:17) As Testemunhas de Jeová têm muito prazer em falar sobre assuntos bíblicos com todos os que anseiam servir a Deus com verdadeira?fé.<br>  <br>  Esperamos que esta considera??o da ora??o do Pai-Nosso tenha aprofundado seu apre?o pelo significado dela. Obter mais conhecimento sobre Jeová e sobre as recompensas que ele promete aos “que seriamente o buscam” fortalecerá a sua fé em Deus. Aprenda mais sobre ele e os seus propósitos para que você possa ter para sempre um relacionamento achegado com o seu Pai celestial. —?Jo?o 17:3.|`|bf4985cef78e254cccda4b0cf074b385aa	é entrar em sintonia com o Deus Pai todo poderoso e criador do céu e da Terra.<br>  Ora??o é se comunicar, é entrar em sintonia.

Além do mais isso é um processo, ninguém é super crente, santinho, nada disso. <br>  Creio que vc entende o que eu quero dizer.

E por isso que evangelizamos pessoas para que eles possam ser vidas transformadas por Jesus, que é o sentido de viver.<br>  Jesus, orando ao Pai pelos discípulos disse:"N?o os pe?o que os tire do mundo mas os livre do mal".

Este é o mundo que Deus amou e pelo qual Jesus morreu. No entanto, The Oxford History of Christianity (História do Cristianismo, de Oxford) declara: “O?‘mundo’ é também um termo de uso crist?o para algo alienado de Deus e hostil a ele.” De que forma é isso verdade? O?autor católico Roland Minnerath explica no seu livro Les chrétiens e le monde (Os crist?os e o mundo): “No sentido pejorativo, o mundo é encarado assim como .?.?. o domínio em que poderes hostis a Deus executam sua atividade, e que, pela sua oposi??o ao domínio vitorioso de Cristo, constitui um império inimigo sob o controle de Satanás.” Este “mundo” é a massa da humanidade alienada de Deus. Os verdadeiros crist?os n?o fazem parte deste mundo, e este os odeia.<br>   As Testemunhas de Jeová amam seus semelhantes e acham que o melhor bem que podem fazer a eles é ajudá-los a obter um conhecimento exato do propósito de Deus, de instituir “novos céus e uma nova terra” justos. (2?Pedro 3:13) Por ensinarem e praticarem os elevados princípios de moral da Bíblia, s?o de valor para a sociedade humana, salvando a muitos da delinqüência. Os servos de Jeová acatam a lei e s?o respeitosos para com ministros e autoridades do governo, juízes e autoridades municipais, dando honra “a quem exigir honra”. (Romanos 13:7) Os pais que s?o Testemunhas cooperam de bom grado com os professores dos seus filhos e ajudam os filhos a estudar bem, para que mais tarde possam ganhar seu sustento e n?o ser um fardo para a sociedade. (1?Tessalonicenses 4:11,?12) Dentro das suas congrega??es, as Testemunhas se op?em ao preconceito racial e à distin??o de classes, e d?o muita importancia a fortalecer a vida familiar. (Atos 10:34,?35; Colossenses 3:18-21) Portanto, mostram pelas suas a??es que s?o falsas as acusa??es de serem contra a vida familiar ou de n?o serem de ajuda para a comunidade. Portanto, as palavras do apóstolo Pedro mostram ser verdadeiras: “Pois a vontade de Deus é que, por fazerdes o bem, possais a?aimar a conversa ignorante dos homens desarrazoados.” —?1?Pedro 2:15.<br>  <br>   Assim, embora os seguidores genuínos de Cristo ‘n?o fa?am parte do mundo’, ainda est?o no mundo da sociedade humana e têm de continuar “andando em sabedoria para com os de fora”.

E, como era de se esperar, as regras de conduta do Levítico aos poucos foram perdendo a razao de ser, devido às diversas influências dos substratos pagaos na cultura européia. No Levítico há coisas como nao se deve comer carne de porco ou frutos do mar, que nao se deve tocar em mulheres no período em que estao menstruadas, que nao se deve usar tecidos diferentes ao mesmo tempo, que nao se deve cultivar graos diferentes no mesmo solo e coisas do gênero.<br>  Ou seja, sao coisas que as diversas culturas que abracaram o cristianismo já faziam de modo universal, e que logicamente nao puderam ser "extirpadas".<br>  <br>  Com a homossexualidade isso é diferente, já que é uma característica de uma minoria, e que, mesmo que tais culturas anteriores ao cristianismo nao tivessem problemas com ela, ela por óbvias razoes nao era vivida "em larga escala". Isso tornou a proibicao possível de se levar adiante sem grandes alteracoes na vida quotidiana.<br>  <br>  Pois bem, a proibicao chegou até os nossos tempos. E chegou sozinha. Quando lemos o Antigo Testamento, vemos como a luta dos judeus, o "povo eleito" contra os inimigos é enfatizada. E a base proselitística - e de manutencao dos fiéis - das igrejas evangélicas está exatamente nessa questao do "povo eleito". Ocorre entao que a necessidade de emular esse "povo eleito" por parte dos evangélicos exige também inimigos. O problema é que nao há inimigos "fisiológicos", entao há que procurá-los. A pegar os homossexuais para esse papel foi um passo, e a sua demonizacao foi tao simples quanto à de espíritas, adeptos de religioes animistas e etc.<br>  <br>  Como "povo eleito" os evangélicos sao obrigados a viverem essa eterna luta contra as serpentes que os circundam. é isso que os diferencia, por exemplo dos católicos, que, apesar da sua religiao também condenar oficialmente a homossexualidade, nao necessitam inimigos.|`|qt02ODslaa	Porq eles querem q a gente se converta e va fazer parte da igreja deles e ajudem no dizimo!!!|`|x2HIVYF1aa	Deus fez o homem e a mulher, para se unirem e se tornarem um asó carne.

N?o importa como eu chego em casa(limpo, sujo, cheiroso, fedorento, com dinheiro, sem dinheiro), n?o importa a hora que chego, eles sempre correm para me receber e n?o sossegam até receber um carinho. <br>  De manh?, quando abro a porta, eles já vem fazer festa e pedir agrado. A noite, se me sento na varanda, eles deitam em volta, se me sento dentro de casa, eles deitam na soleira da porta, só para ficar pertinho do "humano deles".<br>  E ainda ficam me olhando e prestando aten??o quando converso com eles. Sentem-se muitos felizes quando s?o lembrados e, pelo tom de nossa voz, sabem quando estamos bem ou estamos bravos.<br>  Os c?es nos amam incondicionalmente porque eles aprenderam a viver das migalhas de amor e aten??o que damos a eles.<br>  <br>  Opa, pelas respostas dos outros usuarios, acho que eu devia ter colocado essa respostana se??o de animais domésticos...Agora já foi...|`|259cf839be9e6e36b09a8d6aafd484f7aa	é a vivência concreta do amor que deixa marcas. <br>  é o exemplo de Cristo que quis suportar/carregar e amar os irm?os para além do bem e do mal vivendo por nós e por nós se entregando à morte  e morte de cruz.<br>  Esse é o amor incondicional e a cruz é a marca.<br>  <br>  Paz e Bem|`|UbPoTDqEaa	o amor  incondicional é só o de uma m?e por seu filho(a).E′como o amor imortal , uma vez sentido nunca mais esquecido.Eu tive um amor incondicional por uma pessoa e ate′ hoje habita em meu cora??o.Jamais em momento algum esqueci, mora em mim e sempre fara  parte da minha vida .E′esquesito pois me sinto as vezes duas pessoas ,e jamais me sinto só , tenho sua presen?a sempre junto a mim.|`|de4d478160a61265939f30ba46a9b580aa	Como o amor sem fronteiras, que ama mesmo quem odeia.

Tudo no Universo deriva dessa energia do amor incondicional, o funcionamento das leis, a mecanica da vida, o relacionamento entre os seres evoluídos e as leis que regem o mundo. Tudo deriva dele porque é a unica e primeira forma de energia que existe no Universo. <br>  As formas de amor que se conhecem s?o carregadas dos matizes da paix?o, às vezes do egoísmo e n?o raro se transformam em ódio. O amor incondicional, como energia básica da vida, pode ser configurada da maneira como quisermos que seja. Mas é na sua pureza intrínseca que ela promove o bem, edifica os mundos na luz, espalha o amor em todas as dire??es. <br>  O verdadeiro amor incondicional aposta no crescimento, confia nele porque é uma lei da vida baseada no próprio amor incondicional de Deus, que atrai para si toda forma de consciência. Desse fato n?o há como escapar, n?o há como se desviar do objetivo final de toda vida que é a comunh?o com Deus, de onde veio, e a for?a irresistível do amor incondicional é o íma que a todo momento atrai as criaturas de volta ao Grande Sol Central, o centro da Consciência Crística do Universo.|`|IQ9DOhhYaa	áquele que n?o imp?e condi??es para amar.|`|P5273Qeyaa	Luz da Umbanda:<br>  Amor incondicional é aquele que n?o exige nenhum pré-requisito e n?o espera nenhum tipo de resposta. Com base nessa premissa, é puro engano pensar que Deus ama incondicionalmente. Deus ama para ser amado, ou seja, Deus espera que seu amor por nós desperte o amor por Ele. Se Deus amasse do modo incondicional, a salva??o teria de ser universal.<br>  Assim sendo, podemos afirmar que o amor de Deus n?o exige um pré-requisito, mas só salva àquele que responde o seu amor. é a espera da resposta do nosso amor a Ele que elimina a incondicionalidade do amor de Deus.<br>  Abra?o sincero e cordial em todos.|`|SYltUaZOaa	é o amor que Jesus sente por seus filhos....pecamos...fazemos coisas erradas...e mesmo assim nos perdoa e cuida de nós...|`|WOilZJeoaa	um amor cristico, com bases nos ensinamentos de Jesus.<br>  Livre, sem qualquer apego ou preconceito.|`|b4de1c10c370460f02ef6d6922865b9eaa	O amor é o sentimento mais forte que existe no Universo, somente por ele é que Jesus Cristo conseguiu disseminar os seus conhecimentos na humanidade e preserva-los até hoje. Desde sua morte, seu amor ficou no mundo como um foco de luz sempre vivo.<br>  <br>  Amor Incondicional é o amor verdadeiro, aquele que devemos ter para com o nosso próximo, sem exigir nada em troca.|`|cETRSkRZaa	é o amor que só tem uma e exclusiva condi??o, amar a si mesmo a tudo e a todos do jeito que s?o, foram e ser?o, qualquer coisa fora disso n?o é incondicional.|`|wyJ45n6taa	Creio que o amor incondicional é aquele que sentimos sem exigir que sejam da maneira como gostaríamos, é aceitar o próximo da maneira como é.

Isso é amor incondicional. Você n?o está irremediavelmente perdido, pois Jesus te ama ainda que seus pecados sejam os piores possíveis. Claro que existe a Lei da A??o e Rea??o, mas, até aí você vê o amor de Deus, que te oferece a chance de reparar o erro e n?o lan?á-lo a um inferno eterno que n?o existe.|`|3cd90e2901d5727b4d9adfb911923546aa	um Pai dar Seu Filho único para morrer em favor de pessoas que o desprezam.

(revelado, porque sabemos que muitos nao revelam porque tem medo da familia e sociedade)... <br>  E eu, claro, que sou bi... hahahaha Mas sou casada e a pessoa que deve saber sabe: meu marido... e vai bem assim...<br>  Eu tenho pena do meu irmao, mas tenho esperan?a que dentro de pouco tempo a coisa vai explodir e ele vai ver que deve viver pra si mesmo e nao pra manter a dignidade crista da familia (Padrasto pastor e mae que trabalha na igreja.......)<br>  Aceitaria sim!  de bra?os abertos....|`|0Yw0bjAgaa	Claro que aceitaria, aliás eu tenho uma irm? gay, temos uma rela??o normal, ela ficou chateada quando soube de mim, disse que era um Mundo cruel e tantas outras coisas, naquele momento nem ela se aceitava, ent?o n?o teria como ela aceitar ninguém, hoje é tudo numa boa.<br>  <br>  Quando nos nós aceitamos a aceita??o ao próximo vem de forma automática.|`|1391609d487e2c83e21998e2d6c616a9aa	Apesar de ser totalmente o contrario que aconteceu comigo, eu aceitaria sim!

Ele foi preso em 28 de maio, em Belo Horizonte, quando estava em companhia de uma adolescente. Nos depoimentos que prestou à polícia, o padre negou todas as acusa??es. <br>  ? Padre suspeito de pedofilia é preso<br>  <br>  Segundo a delegada Adriene Lopes de Oliveira, "há provas contundentes e harm?nicas que justificam o indiciamento". O suspeito vai responder judicialmente pelo crime de estupro, com presun??o de violência, já que a vítima é menor de 14 anos, explicou. <br>  <br>  O padre era investigado há cinco meses pela polícia, desde que surgiram as primeiras denúncias de pedofilia contra ele. "Conseguimos apurar que ele se hospedou, acompanhado de crian?as, com idades entre 13 e 14 anos, em hotéis da regi?o e também em um apartamento em Belo Horizonte", afirmou a delegada. <br>  <br>  No dia da pris?o, a garota que estava com Gon?alves confirmou à polícia que teve rela??es sexuais com ele. A menina passou por exames de corpo de delito que comprovaram o ato. Ainda segundo a polícia, o padre iria todos os finais de semana para Belo Horizonte, onde tem um apartamento no bairro Serra Verde, regi?o norte da capital mineira, acompanhado de um menino de 13 anos, que também seria de Carmo da Mata. <br>  <br>  Para concluir o inquérito e indiciar o pároco de Carmo da Mata, a delegada ouviu os depoimentos de supostas vítimas, dos pais delas, além de funcionários e proprietários de hotéis e pousadas, onde ele costumava se hospedar. O padre está preso na Delegacia de Divinópolis, também no centro-oeste de Minas Gerais.|`|vmwHnAWAaa	A maioria sim, porém os padres s?o seres humanos de carne e osso, ent?o alguns devem falhar...

430ab7a92c08b372044b762a697eb09aaa	No livro "2012, profecia maia", os autores demonstram a liga??o entre as civiliza??es pré-colombianas da América Central e do Velho Mundo, em particular a egípcia. Examinando registros arqueológicos, encontraram grandes evidências que ligam as origens da civiliza??o maia com os misterioso continente perdido de Atlantida, o qual teria sido destruído por uma série de catástrofes.  <br>  Eles revelam que o Calendário Maia profetiza o fim de nossa era (segundo os maias “Era do Jaguar” ), no ano de 2012 DC. Isto, segundo Cotterell, ocorrerá com uma repentina revers?o do campo magnético da Terra.  <br>  Em 1958 já aconteceu um Máximo Solar. Naquele ano n?o poderia antever que estava a chegar uma tempestade solar, mesmo assim, as pessoas sabiam que algo de grandes dimens?es estava a acontecer, quando as Auroras Boreais foram avistadas por três vezes no México e uma no Canadá. Nos cerca de duzentos anos, desde a descoberta do ciclo de 11 anos de manchas solares, que os cientistas têm vindo a debater-se para tentar prever o futuro máximo solar, mas sem sucesso. O máximo solar pode ser intenso, como em 1958, ou praticamente indetectável, como em 1805, n?o obedecendo a nenhum padr?o óbvio.A chave do mistério é uma corrente de transporte de campos magnéticos no Sol.<br>  Possuímos algo semelhante no nosso planeta - a grande corrente oceanica de transporte, popularizada pelo filme de fic??o científica "The Day After Tomorrow". é uma 'rede' de correntes oceanicas que transporta água e calor de oceano para oceano. Nauele filme, esta corrente parou, originando o caos do clima mundial. A corrente de transporte do Sol é uma corrente, n?o de água, mas de gás condutor de electricidade. Flui em arco entre o equador solar e os pólos e vice versa. Tal como a grande corrente oceanica controla o clima da Terra, esta corrente solar controla o clima no Sol, mais concretamente o ciclo de manchas solares.<br>  Primeiro recordemos o que s?o as manchas solares: nós entrela?ados de campos magnéticos gerados pelo dínamo interno do Sol. Uma mancha solar típica existe apenas ao longo de poucas semanas, após o que decai, deixando para trás um 'cadáver' de fracos campos magnéticos.<br>  Entremos na corrente de transporte do Sol.<br>  O topo da corrente de transporte aflora a superfície do Sol varrendo os campos magnéticos de velhas e 'mortas' manchas solares. Os seus 'cadáveres' s?o arrastados para baixo, até aos pólos, para uma profundidade de 200.000 km, onde o dínamo magnético do Sol os pode amplificar. Uma vez amplificados, estes nós magnéticos tornam-se flutuantes e voltam à superfície solar. Renascem assim novas manchas solares! Tudo isto acontece com uma lentid?o enorme. Passam-se cerca de 40 anos até que um único ciclo seja completado. A sua velocidade varia "algures entre um percurso de 50 anos (lento) ou um ciclo de 30 anos (rápido)."<br>  Quando a corrente flui de forma rápida, significa que est?o a ser varridos para cima imensos campos magnéticos e que um futuro ciclo de manchas solares vai ser intenso, a corrente esteve a girar de forma rápida entre 1986-1996. Os velhos campos magnéticos dever?o reaparecer como grandes manchas solares em 2010-2011.<br>  Tendo a concordar que o próximo máximo solar será muito intenso. A história demonstra que um grande ciclo de manchas solares sobe de forma mais rápida que um pequeno, as primeiras manchas do novo ciclo é possível que apare?am já no final de 2007 e o máximo Solar tornar-se efectivo em 2010 ou 2011. De uma forma ou de outra, uma tempestade vem a caminho. Os cientistas do National Center for Atmospheric Research foram bem sucedidos ao simular a intensidade do ciclo de manchas solares, através do desenvolvimento de um novo modelo informático de processos solares. Existem até observa??es dos últimos 12 ciclos com os resultados do modelo que fica muito próximo dos picos de manchas solares. O nível de intensidade é baseado na quantidade de hemisfério solar com manchas activas visíveis. A equipa do NCAR prevê que o próximo ciclo seja 30 a 50% mais intenso que o ciclo actual.<br>  Isto quer dizer que para além das muta??es climáticas que se vir?o a sentir, e que aliás já se sentem e que em grande parte se devem ao aquecimento global, acontecer?o situa??es praticamente imprevisíveis nos fenómenos atmosféricos que poder?o provocar violentas catástrofes a nível mundial. Agora se isso terá a ver com as profecias de Fátima ou n?o, é um caso de fé, talcomo no caso dos Maias e os restantes povos que "previam" fenómenos de natureza astronómica com uma grande precis?o.|`|242ca19fd7dc56821ff28f2e4a2419f2aa	Pelo que llí nas respostas anteriores, vamos ter que esperar até 2011.<br>  Ou entao, vamos tentar reverter toda essa situa?ao caótica que conseguimos arranjar para o nosso planeta e, quem sabe assim, conseguiremos anular algumas catástrofes futuras.

E vimos n'uma luz emensa que é Deus: “algo semelhante a como se vêem as pessoas n'um espelho quando lhe passam por diante” um Bispo vestido de Branco “tivemos o pressentimento de que era o Santo Padre”. Varios outros Bispos, Sacerdotes, religiosos e religiosas subir uma escabrosa montanha, no cimo da qual estava uma grande Cruz de troncos toscos como se f?ra de sobreiro com a casca; o Santo Padre, antes de chegar aí, atravessou uma grande cidade meia em ruínas, e meio trémulo com andar vacilante, acabrunhado de d?r e pena, ia orando pelas almas dos cadáveres que encontrava pelo caminho; chegado ao cimo do monte, prostrado de juelhos aos pés da grande Cruz foi morto por um grupo de soldados que lhe dispararam varios tiros e setas, e assim mesmo foram morrendo uns trás outros os Bispos Sacerdotes, religiosos e religiosas e varias pessoas seculares, cavalheiros e senhoras de varias classes e posi??es. Sob os dois bra?os da Cruz estavam dois Anjos cada um com um regador de cristal em a m?o, n'êles recolhiam o sangue dos Martires e com êle regavam as almas que se aproximavam de Deus. <br>  <br>  ****As autoridades do Vaticano teimam em interpretar esta mensagem como tendo sido o atentado que o Papa Jo?o Paulo II sofreu em 13 de maio de 1981.

AA12005596	Outro dia faltei ao trabalho e meus chefes (ex-policiais militares) chegaram em mim e disseram se algo estava acontecendo, porque eu havia faltado, coisa e tal. Simplesmente olhei para a cara deles e disse: "Olha, eu ando farto do preconceito que róla aqui. Eu faltei porque eu tenho um namorado problemático e fui resolver os problemas dele". Eles ficaram me olhando com a boca aberta e disseram: "N?o... ninguém aqui tem preconceito pela sua op??o sexual." E eu fiquei feliz em saber que hoje em dia n?o tenho qualquer medo de dizer que gosto de homens. Na verdade eu n?o tenho namorado, mas falei aquilo para for?ar mesmo a barra do assunto homossexualidade. Só eu sei o que eu passei pra fazer esse povo que trabalha comigo admitir que há gays no mundo e há que conviver com eles pacificamente e ponto final.

Tem que ser bom. Tem que ultrapassar as expectativas.<br>  Você tem que dar exemplo da sua retidao, fazer as pessoas te respeitarem pelo que você é, e nao pelo conceito negativo que elas têm do grupo ao qual você pertence.<br>  <br>  Ao final, quando as pessoas aprendem a te admirar, nao sobra mais espaco para preconceito.<br>  <br>  Isso nao tem erro. Funciona sempre. Já se a pessoa nao te der nem a chance de mostrar o que você realmente é, aí é porque ela nao te merece, entao nao cabe a ela nada além de ser ignorada.

Se vivemos no meio de le?es, podemos amansá-los tratando-os bem, mas cautelosamente, como serpentes astutas. E, quem sabe, mesmo que alguns nos odeiem ou caluniem por acharem-nos diferentes, seremos amados verdadeiramente pelos que sentir-se-?o atraídos  pela lei dos semelhantes. é isso aí. SDS Carlos.
GH01a6Jqaa	A Bíblia mostra claramente que existem “for?as espirituais iníquas” que enganam e amedrontam o homem. Em Efésios 6:12 o apóstolo Paulo as descreve quais “for?as espirituais iníquas nos lugares celestiais”, contra as quais o homem tem de se precaver. Tais poderosos anjos iníquos podem facilmente fazer coisas astuciosas ou mesmo fazer-se passar por pessoas que já morreram. Satanás tentou enganar o primeiro casal humano a respeito da morte dizendo que eles n?o morreriam. Esse embuste é um modo hábil do qual se serve para apoiar seu ensino falso da imortalidade do homem. —?Gênesis 3:4; Jo?o 8:44.<br>  <br>  é evidente que essas “for?as espirituais iníquas” às vezes aproveitam a época da morte duma pessoa para afligir e amedrontar parentes por meio de situa??es desagradáveis. Uma senhora em Estocolmo, Suécia, disse: “Depois que meu marido morreu, muitas vezes fui acordada à noite por estampidos estridentes no ch?o do meu quarto de dormir. Era como se alguém atirasse balas de a?o. Você pode ver essas marcas redondas, como que formadas por estilha?os, ali no assoalho. O televisor também foi ‘bombardeado’ desse modo. Certa noite fui acordada por alguns estalos fortes no ar acima da minha cama. Fiquei extremamente amedrontada.”<br>  <br>  Outros, porém, tiveram experiências agradáveis. Por exemplo, uma mulher descreveu como seu recém-falecido esposo apareceu a ela de noite e dirigiu-lhe a palavra. Ela disse que estava muito bonito e usava belas roupas.<br>  <br>  Experiência similar foi contada por outra mulher: “Pouco depois da morte de meu marido, ele apareceu na minha frente num quarto. Metade do quarto estava escura e a outra metade luminosa. Vê-lo ali na parte luminosa do quarto, tocando guitarra, convenceu-me de que ele vivia ent?o num lugar luminoso e agradável.”<br>  <br>  Um homem narrou o seguinte caso: “Por muitos anos vivi sozinho com a minha m?e. Ela cuidava da casa e da cozinha. Certo dia, depois que morreu, ao descansar num sofá eu a ouvi chamando da cozinha: ‘Venha comer! A comida está pronta!’ Primeiro pensei que havia sonhado, mas ali estava, na mesa, uma refei??o quente e bem preparada.”<br>  <br>  Surge a pergunta: Podem os agentes iníquos de Satanás empenhar-se em tais atividades agradáveis? Deus inspirou o apóstolo Paulo a dar uma resposta muito simples, dizendo: “O que n?o é de espantar: pois se o próprio Satanás se transforma em anjo de luz, n?o é nada de extraordinário que seus ministros se disfarcem em ministros da justi?a [ou: agentes do bem].” (2?Coríntios 11:14,?15, Bíblia Vozes; New English Bible) Para enganar e desencaminhar as pessoas, os dem?nios amiúde parecem ser bons e prestativos. —?1?Timóteo 4:1.<br>  <br>  Qualquer pessoa com experiências similares que queira livrar-se da influência das ‘for?as iníquas’ deve recorrer a Jeová Deus em busca de ajuda. Jesus Cristo ensinou seus seguidores a orar a Deus: “Livra-nos do iníquo.” (Mateus 6:13) Deus ouve ora??es que emanam dum cora??o puro. “Os olhos de Jeová est?o sobre os justos e os seus ouvidos est?o atentos às súplicas deles.” —?1?Pedro 3:12; Provérbios 15:29.<br>  <br>  Ter conhecimento da Palavra de Deus, a Bíblia, também ajuda. Um cuidadoso estudo dela revela a real condi??o dos mortos. Cria firme esperan?a na futura ressurrei??o dos mortos. Revela também a identidade das ‘for?as iníquas’ no domínio espiritual e mostra como evitar ser enganado e molestado por elas.<br>  Alguns casos misteriosos podem ser explicados pelo que a Bíblia chama de “o tempo e o imprevisto”. (Eclesiastes 9:11) Em matéria de tempo, as coisas podem coincidir de maneira quase inacreditável. Por exemplo, milh?es de relógios em todo o mundo n?o param quando seus donos morrem. Contudo, as leis da probabilidade indicam que em algum lugar, em alguma época, um relógio parará por raz?es mecanicas no exato momento da morte de seu dono. Similarmente, outros imprevistos podem coincidir com a morte de alguém.<br>  <br>  Também, estranhas ocorrências visuais ou audíveis após a morte de alguém podem ter explica??o natural. Uma longa vida junto com uma pessoa pode ter deixado uma impress?o t?o profunda na mente do (a) consorte sobrevivente, que subitamente podem ocorrer momentos em que este (a) aparentemente sente a presen?a da pessoa falecida.<br>  <br>  é interessante que os cientistas descobriram que algumas pessoas possuem o que é chamado de imagina??o eidética, isso é, a habilidade de ver imagens mentais como se estivessem suspensas fora da cabe?a. A Encyclopaedia Britannica (em inglês) diz sob “imagem eidética”: “A pessoa eidética n?o apenas pode imaginar um objeto ausente, mas age como se realmente o visse.”<br>  <br>  Assim, o que quer ou quem quer que esteja por trás duma ocorrência misteriosa em conex?o com a morte de alguém, n?o se trata da própria pessoa morta, em qualquer forma ou figura.|`|WKi3xPYQaa	Como vc disse Mina, "...cheguei à conclus?o que é nossa mente que cria tudo..." assim é Deus também...|`|cETRSkRZaa	n?o|`|cV7lnJi6aa	Mina, você está completamente equivocada.

Respeito a tua opini?o, mas eu também n?o acreditava, até que quis pesquisar e ver com meus próprios olhos os fen?menos inexplicáveis, mormente no Espiritismo e na Umbanda. De uns anos para cá Deus abriu um portal de conhecimentos para mim que somente me ajudaram a auxiliar o próximo. Encaro o sobrenatural naturalmente porque Deus me fez conhecer o que oculta aos outros n?o para que eu tenha orgulho próprio, mas para que eu use em benefício de quem precisa de uma luz. Tal qual como eu precisei no passado, essas pessoas hoje enxerguem os fen?menos que Deus coloca em nossa rotina para justamente acreditarem que existe um Poder Superior. Acredito em Deus e vivo os princípios de Jesus Cristo, mas sou um homem feliz por ter sido escolhido por Deus para levar o nome dEle como forma de labor e evolu??o necessária a todas as pessoas que transitam momentaneamente pela Terra.|`|NeOWERf8aa	O sobrenatural n?o existe, oque existe é que as pessoas n?o est?o acostumadas a outras realidades. Vivem no seu mundinho e tudo que é diferente precisa mais contato para ficar banalizado. Quem poderia acreditar que algumas cidades tem balas perdidas voando pelo ar? Isso n?o é natural, mas com o tempo as pessoas acostumam e chegam a se convencer que as balas foram perdidas... Tudo isso para dizer que o diferente, o raro, pode ser chamado de sobrenatural é t?o natural como a primeira vez em tudo.

Você, ao menos, n?o luta em causa própria, vê-se, né colega? Se é para ser uma "Dom Quixote" contra esse tipo de atitude, penso que tem de levar em conta que seres humanos têm seis sentidos (e dizem que as mulheres sete! - rsrsrsr) e um deles é o da vis?o. N?o dá para fugir disso, n?o é injusti?a, é simplesmente a natureza. Seria como achar injusto n?o comermos a comida feita por nossa m?e, "T?o gostosa" - diz ela, mas que esqueceu de p?r um único tempero (paladar). Ou ficar ouvindo o vizinho tocar bateria a mil (!) bem na sua janela (audi??o): ele pode dizer que é uma injusti?a você n?o gostar. Ou um comerciante querer te empurrrar o tomate mais amassado do mercado e convencê-la que tatear o produto é bobagem ("O que vale é a essência dele, o conteúdo é sempre o mesmo" - diz o esperto!). Quando fosse comprar um perfume, ter de aceitar aquele que tem cheiro de azeite e vinagre (olfato), sen?o seria injusti?a com essa fórmula "maravilhosa".  Finalmente, gostamos também de quem tem uma bela fala (acho que completei os 6 sentidos, né?) tanto pela sonoridade quanto pelo assunto, sen?o saímos de pertoe também n?o acho que seja preconceito contra os "taquara-rachada e sem assunto".<br>  Mas concordo com você que, em tudo isso, há exageros, isso sim ruim, como a busca obsessiva por ser magra. (E n?o sei como essas mulheres ainda n?o entenderam a nós homens: gostamos das que têm alguma coisinha, volume; magra-magra só quem gosta é estilista de moda.<br>  Aliel, concordo com você que todos ficaremos velhos, mas nem todos perdem a beleza física também. Você, por exemplo, sei que n?o perderá...

Uns se descobrem cedo, outros mais tarde mas, a op??o já está dentro da pessoa, da cabe?a. <br>  <br>  Já houve um fato um tempo atrás. Vi essa noticia na net, n?o lembro em que data mas, a história já tem muitos anos.<br>  <br>  Conta a história de um rapaz que na hora de seu nascimento, teve o pênis decepado, por acidente. Os psicólogos(?), decidiram que o melhor, para n?o haver traumas, que era melhor o menino ser criado como se fosse menina.<br>  <br>  Seus pais come?aram a tratá-lo como menina. Vestiam ele com saias e davam bonecas pra ele brincar. O problema foi quando ele come?ou a crescer, e se interessar por meninas e jogar bola.<br>  <br>  Resultado:- Quando ele virou adulto, já sabendo da verdade, teve que fazer uma opera??o de uma prótese peniana. Casou e parece que leva uma vida normal.<br>  <br>  Por isso que eu digo que, quando uma pessoa nasce, já nasce com a op??o sexual formada. N?o é doen?a ou defeito como os preconceituosos falam, ou pior, que est?o com o dem?nio. Essas afirma??es s?o totalmente ridículas e, quem fala essas coisas é que deve sofrer desses males.|`|N61ljdv6aa	há de todos os tipos|`|VGQuOyDtaa	Eu n?o sei dizer, mas ser gay n?o eh uma escolha, vc eh e pronto, eu acho que ninguém consegue responder pois n?o se sabe quando virou gay, vc soh se descobre e pronto!<br>  Pelo menos eh assim q eu penso, mta gente diz que eh doen?a ou safadeza, eu digo que n?o eh, pq vc nao escolheu ser o que eh!<br>  Agora o que nao vale eh a pessoa ficar parada e n?o rcurar seu verdadeiro amor seja hetero ou gay!|`|govGz5uBaa	Qual diferen?a isso faz. A pessoa só passa a ter no?ao de  sexualidade por volta dos 10 anos de idade. Se a pessoa nasce gay o vira gay, de nada importa. O que importa é que ela é uma pessoa como outra qualquer, suscetível de amor, carinho e respeito como qualquer ser humano. O caráter da pessoa n?o está na sua sexualidade, mas sim na sua personalidade.<br>  Portanto, n?o fique preocupado com isso. Respeite um gay como respeita a ti mesmo.|`|pw2ACCo9aa	A ciência ainda nao conseguiu descobrir isso até hoje.<br>  Há dezenas de estudos a esse respeito; em geral conseguem chegar a indícios desta ou daquela teoria, mas como sempre encontram excecoes, nao conseguem chegar a uma conclusao cientificamente válida.<br>  Muito provavelmente existem diversas componentes.<br>  <br>  Na verdade isso nao é importante.

O que pode ocorrer, em determinados casos é que os caminhos percorridos ou o erro de um pode interferir na evolu??o do outro.<br>  <br>  Independente do caráter da pessoa, posi??o social, op??o sexual, ser boa ou má,  toda e qualquer Entidade pode evoluir tantto ou até mais que outras. <br>  <br>  Contudo, a evolu??o e o modo de trabalhar desta entidade pode ficar entrela?ado com as características da pessoa. Exemplo: uma pessoa que só pensa em maldade ou gosta muito de fazer  feiti?os p/ o mal, sua Entidade vai fazer com que coisas do mesmo escal?o se aproxime dela. A Entidade poderá ficar com a for?a em desiquilíbrio, ou seja, ficando com a for?a voltada mais para o lado em que se encontra aquele a quem ela incorpora.<br>  <br>  A evolu??o de cada pessoa, depende de dois pontos chave: a for?a de vontade da própria pessoa, a for?a de vontade e competência de ensinar do(a) Pai/M?e de Santo.<br>  <br>  A Evolu??o da Entidade, depende apenas e unicamente do(a) Pai/M?e de Santo.

Agora, com rela??o ao médium, o critério n?o tem nada a ver com o tempo, mas sim com qual entidade ou gira ele tem maior liga??o....há médiuns que trabalham há mais de 5 anos com a mesma entidade..n?o tem a ver com a experiência mas sim com a liga??o entre as entidades e seus "cavalos" - como s?o chamados os médiuns.

DEUS permite que os seres humanos se agrupem por afinidade. O agrupamento DE ALGUMAS SEITAS QUE “SE ACHAM” tem uma fun??o divina DE RECOLHER pessoas que se afinam com os AXIOMAS acima descritos. Os tempos que vivemos s?o uma prepara??o para breves acontecimentos que transformar?o o planeta, esta chegando o tempo de separar o joio do trigo e isto já está come?ando a ocorrer.<br>  MAS QUAL DEVE SER NOSSA ATITUDE NA LUZ DE DEUS?<br>  Primeiramente é n?o cair no mesmo erro de se achar salvo e que eles ser?o condenados, pois estaremos nos candidatando a ficar do lado do joio. Jesus ensina que quando nos bate em uma face devemos dar a outra, o que n?o significa omiss?o e covardia e sim uma atitude de n?o violência e de mudan?a de sintonia.<br>  é levar amor onde exista o ódio, perd?o onde há ofensas, luz onde existam trevas.<br>  No contraste entre luz e trevas muitos come?ar?o a perceber a grandeza da Luz, n?o pelos discursos e sim pelos exemplos uma vez que as palavras podem indicar o caminho, mas os exemplos podem arrastar para a caminhada, se maus exemplos levam ao mau caminho, todavia um bom exemplo pode-se arrastar para o bom caminho sem invadir o livre arbítrio das pessoas.<br>  N?o somos santos, temos ainda muito por caminhar e a jornada n?o é fácil, mas ninguém falou que seria.|`|1f5778ccbbf27fa7fe40ddebb62e258faa	siga ela e viva em paz vc tem o poder de escolha para uma vida mais feliz independente da minha ou de outras opini?es|`|6e8f40f9d7ec041b88ecc80a9a3b9065aa	nossa que perda de tempo a sua escrever isso em ! heheheh<br>   Se voce cre nisso bom pra voce, quando a pessoa cre em algo nao espelha para ninguem cre e fica consigo isso <br>   Vai querer se aparecer assim em|`|b4de1c10c370460f02ef6d6922865b9eaa	Quanto aos evangélicos quem sou eu para julgar? <br>  Mas frequento a Umbanda há 3 anos e me sinto muito bem, fui muito ajudada e por isso estou me desenvolvendo nela para ajudar outras pessoas.

Um dos riscos mais recentes foi ter saído do RJ indo até Uma cidade do Rio Grande do Sul conhecer uma mulher maravilhosa. Ela somente tinha me enviado uma foto mostrando apenas o rosto. Q mulher tenho hoje em minha cama! Antes disso trabalhava numa área bem diferente da qual trabalho hoje. Tinha uma posi??o de destaque com 22 anos de idade abandonei tudo para iniciar em outra carreira q na época só maluco acreditava em sucesso... Sou muito bem sucedido. E continuo me arriscando mas para isso o meu atrevimento ou risco n?o é comedido mas sim frio e calculista. N?o perco pq acredito q arriscar faz parte do processo de vencer!!!

ysocI4zjaa	Foram duas, as poesias da minha vida, as que realmente marcaram, embora existam tantas outras igualmente belas, porém quen?o aconteceram na época em que me sentia - uma, mais fragilizado outra, mais feliz. Sinta as duas e vou citar três:<br>  <br>  FáTUO AMOR<br>  <br>  Até há pouco era perfeitamente suportável<br>  A solid?o que me impunha tua ausência,<br>  Pois que, estavas ausente. Desde, porém,<br>  Que houveste, tornaste-me dolorosa e<br>  Palpável a distancia entre mim e ti.<br>  Anseia-me a alma por tuas palavras!<br>  Quero respirar-te. Faltas-me ar.<br>  Clareias-me, Luz!<br>  Anseio em contagem regressiva do momento<br>  Em que me posto, até o instante que me<br>  Sinta lido por ti.<br>  Escreve urgente, e mais,<br>  Fala de ti!<br>  Desde tanto! Quanta distancia! Quanto tempo!<br>  Tanta energia desperdi?ada!<br>  Onde? Quando?<br>  Matas-me!... Pere?o.<br>  Tenhas-me!... Faltas-me.<br>  Primeiro a alegria da espera!<br>  Depois a prostra??o no abandono.<br>  Esqueceste-me?... ou, porventura,<br>  N?o me recebeste?<br>  Pelo Cristo. Fala!<br>  Fátuo Amor.<br>  <br>   Paulo Vargas<br>  <br>  <br>  Houve um Tempo<br>  <br>  <br>  “Houve um  tempo em que a minha janela dava para um quintal, onde uma vasta mangueira alastrava a sua copa redonda. Debaixo da árvore, passava quase todo o dia sentada em uma esteira uma mulher, cercada de crian?as. E contava histórias. Eu n?o a podia ouvir da altura da minha janela. E mesmo que a ouvisse n?o entenderia nada, pois isso aconteceu em um país distante. Numa língua estranha. Mas as crian?as faziam com as m?os arabescos t?o compreensíveis, que eu participava do auditório, entendia os personagens e me sentia completamente feliz.<br>   às vezes, abro a janela e vejo o jasmineiro em flor. Outras vezes, nuvens sombrias. Carros que passam pela rua. Crian?as que v?o para a escola. Pardais que pulam pelo muro. Gatos que abrem e fecham os olhos, sonhando com pardais. Borboletas brancas, duas a duas, como que refletidas no espelho do ar. Marimbondos, que sempre me lembram personagens de Lope de Vega. às vezes um avi?o passa. às vezes um galo canta. Tudo está em seu lugar, cumprindo o seu destino. E eu me sinto completamente feliz.<br>   Mas, quando falo dessas pequenas felicidades certas que existem debaixo de cada janela. Uns dizem que essas coisas n?o existem. Outros, que elas só existem debaixo das minhas janelas. E outros finalmente, que é preciso aprender a olhar, para poder vê-las assim.”     <br>  <br>  Noite Secreta<br>  <br>  “Dormirei para avistar-te<br>  Correndo a vida de pedra<br>  Como a água que vem da mata<br>  Clara e certa.<br>  <br>  Dormirei para escutar-te<br>  Cantar sobre a noite negra,<br>  Tua voz iluminada,<br>  áureo cometa.<br>  <br>  Dormirei sobre saudades<br>  Vendo ser lágrima e estrela,<br>  O que n?o tem mais resposta,<br>  Vida ou terra.<br>  <br>  Dormirei sobre estes sonhos,<br>  Enquanto a manh? n?o chega,<br>  Enquanto n?o sonho o dia:<br>  Noite secreta.”<br>  Vê formarem-se sobre todas as águas<br>  todas as nuvens.<br>  Os ventos vir?o de todos os nortes.<br>  Os dilúvios cair?o sobre os mundos.<br>  Tu n?o morrerás.<br>  N?o há ventos que teescure?am.<br>  N?o há ventos que te desfa?am.<br>  N?o há águas que te afoguem.<br>  Tu és a própria nuvem, <br>  O próprio vento, <br>  A própria chuva sem fim..."<br>                            <br>                                                                                     Bom Jesus do Itabapoana,    11/11/2006|`|1ff045314e6490e90f28c553c920de9baa	n?o é uma poesia e sim uma frase:<br>  <br>  O que sabemos é uma gota,<br>  O uqe ignoramos é um oceano.<br>  <br>                                              albert einstein.|`|3f5ea587cef5200c3b1c095beb7d2262aa	nao gostode ler muito|`|dQBGwnsJaa	A que mais gostei e q nunca me esque?o é esta:<br>  <br>  Ismália<br>  <br>  Alphonsus de Guimaraens<br>  <br>  <br>  Quando Ismália enlouqueceu,<br>  P?s-se na torre a sonhar...<br>  Viu uma lua no céu,<br>  Viu outra lua no mar.<br>  <br>  No sonho em que se perdeu,<br>  Banhou-se toda em luar...<br>  Queria subir ao céu,<br>  Queria descer ao mar...<br>  <br>  E, no desvario seu,<br>  Na torre p?s-se a cantar...<br>  Estava perto do céu,<br>  Estava longe do mar...<br>  <br>  E como um anjo pendeu<br>  As asas para voar...<br>  Queria a lua do céu,<br>  Queria a lua do mar...<br>  <br>  As asas que Deus lhe deu<br>  Ruflaram de par em par...<br>  Sua alma subiu ao céu,<br>  Seu corpo desceu ao mar...<br>  <br>  <br>  Acho mto linda, mas eu tb escrevo poesias, sou apaixonada por isso.

Deus ent?o decidiu eliminar a popula??o mundial provocando uma grande inunda??o, poupando porém Noé e sua família, que se mostraram bons aos seus olhos. Ent?o Deus enviou um anjo a Noé, ordenando-lhe a constru??o de uma grande embarca??o, onde ele reuniria todos os animais da Terra pelos 40 dias de dilúvio. Noé ent?o reuniu um casal de cada espécie e abrigou sua família no interior da arca. 40 dias depois, quando a chuva cessou e a água come?ou a descer, Noé soltou uma pomba, que lhe trouxe uma folha de oliveira, indicando que a Terra já estava seca. A arca teria ficado encalhada no alto de uma montanha, supostamente sobre o Monte Ararat, na Armênia.<br>  <br>  A Noé e seus descendentes coube a tarefa de povoar a Terra. A fonte extra-bíblica de Flávio Josefo detalha em pormenores a descendência de Noé, e quais povos cada um de seus filhos e netos teria dado origem. A vida de Noé após o dilúvio, porém, é curiosamente deturpada pelo alcoolismo. Em certa altura, embebedara-se com o vinho produzido de sua própria videira de tal modo que encontrou-se nu em sua tenda. Seu filho Cam o viu e chamou seus irm?os para que o cobrissem. Quando recobrou a consciência, Noé amaldi?oou C? e seu neto Cana?, porém aben?oando seus outros filhos, Sem e Jafé.<br>  <br>  A história de Noé tem forte significado simbólico sobre boa parte da história de Israel, principalmente durante o período da conquista de Cana? narrada no livro de Josué. A maldi??o de Noé certamente foi usada pelos povos semitas (ou seja, descendentes de Sem, cujos hebreus fazem parte) como justificativa para a conquista da terra de Cana? (ocupada pelos cananeus, alegadamente descendentes de Cana?, neto amaldi?oado de Noé).

Hoje Cristo quer te salvar e te dar o conhecimento de Sua grandeza. Aceite hoje a Cristo e passe a viver por Seu Espírito Santo e serás nova criatura, remido e lavado no sengue de Jesus. Serás verdadeiramente um filho de Deus.<br>  <br>  (II Corintios 5:17-21) - Assim que, se alguém está em Cristo, nova criatura é; as coisas velhas já passaram; eis que tudo se fez novo. E tudo isto provém de Deus, que nos reconciliou consigo mesmo por Jesus Cristo, e nos deu o ministério da reconcilia??o; Isto é, Deus estava em Cristo reconciliando consigo o mundo, n?o lhes imputando os seus pecados; e p?s em nós a palavra da reconcilia??o. De sorte que somos embaixadores da parte de Cristo, como se Deus por nós rogasse.

Tenho grandes amigos homossexuais, tenho colegas homossexuais que respeito, admiro e que me merecem muitas vezes mais aten??o do que outros, exactamente porque n?o têm estas atitudes estigmatizantes e xenófobas que alguns senhores têm.|`|brU0G3Pvaa	que sejam livres..., mas n?o vem me dar piadinha n?o...|`|kbR8Za0Caa	Primeiramente gostaria de mudar a terminologia dessa palavra: Homossexualidade é bem melhor. "ismo" é um sufixo comuns em doen?as e coisas mais prejorativas ou coisas de comunidade religiosa ou grupal. exemplo: Botulismo, Comunismo, Mongolismo, Induismo. "idade" é um sufixo mais agradável. Minha opini?o é que a homossexualidade é um feito da natureza pois existe entre todos os animais. O homem como animal n?o foge á regra e também alguns reagem com esse dom. A homossexualidade é feito pela natureza para equilibrar o ecossistema, a densidade demográfica, a pacifica??o entre o mesmo sexo e a preserva??o da espécie através da parte amigável e afetiva entre o mesmo sexo. Além disso para o homem que n?o faz sexo somente para procriar, faz sexo para sentir prazer e para passar amor a outra pessoa. O amor e o sexo est?o ligados no ser humando. Há o sexo sem amor e amor com sexo, entre heterossexuais ou homossexuais. Para concluir a minha opini?o digo uma palabra que resume: Normal|`|qTSsmsiFaa	S?o pessoas e muito mais humanas do que os heteros.

Inicialmente, os gays sao aceitos no Brasil enquanto "palhacos". Ou seja, desde que um gay nao queira se mostrar "normal" ou no mesmo nível dos outros, ele nao tem problemas. Se ele for aquele estereótipo do gay, às vezes até se travestindo, ele é aceito - porque ele assume o papel de "bobo da corte" da sociedade, e com isso ele também acha o seu pequeno nicho na mesma.<br>  Pelo machismo na nossa sociedade, o homem hetero o vê como uma mulher, logo um ser inferior. E a mulher hetero o vê como um homem do qual ela se sente próxima, por ele nao estar tao acima dela. Isso ajuda na aceitacao do gay. <br>  <br>  Já as lésbicas geram uma certa inseguranca tanto a homens quanto a mulheres heterossexuais. Por esse mesmo  machismo, elas incomodam por "quererem ser mais do que realmente sao". Homens se sentem incomodados por elas serem inatingíveis, mulheres se sentem incomodadas pelas lésbicas insistirem em nao assumir um caráter submisso, "colocando-se no seu lugar inferior de mulher na hora que isso se faz necessário" - no que a maioria das mulheres hetero no Brasil ainda sao mestres.<br>  E além disso ainda há um outro ponto: a sexualidade da mulher no Brasil ainda nao é levada a sério. O próprio fetiche de alguns homens de quererem ver lésbicas juntas é baseado nisso - que as lésbicas só "brincam", já que sexo mesmo é só quando há um homem presente. Mulheres ainda sao freqüentemente vistas como praticando o sexo só para satisfazerem aos homens. Porisso as lésbicas passam "desapercebidas" - na verdade elas sao deliberadamente ignoradas.|`|y0qMjOOOaa	Os gays,n?o sei explicar o porque exatamente, mas acredito que as lesbica, quando est?o em um relacionamento, elas s?o mais discreta na vis?o da sociedade, pois a coisa mais comum e ver duas mulheres  de m?os dadas, passeando, para a sociedade isso normal, agora quando se trata-se de 2 homens na mesma situa?ao o pensamento e outro, ou e gay ou e gay, ou seja na? tem pra onde correr, e quando se trata de gays afeminados,  a situ??o e mais complicada ainda, para muitos isso e inaceitavel, e motivo de obobinancia, goza?ao etc...ja li comentarios aqui mesmo Yh, de pessoas que n?o teem preconceito, mas simplismente acha a′pratica sexual de ambos repuguinante!!!ent?o sao varias questoes que fazem essa realidade inaceitavel, pois acho que ninguem tem nada a ver com vida de ninguem, mas fazer o que ne??? mas logo logo esse quadro vai mudar, o dia dos preconceituosos est?o contados, levando em conta e claro que um dia isso era muito pior!!!

Ele nos dá o poder de escolha. Ele nos permite escolher viver com ele ou sem ele. E, amorosamente, diz primeiro quais as conseqüências d cada escolha, pra ninguém dizer q foi injusti?ado. Esse livre arbítrio foi representado pela árvore proibida no éden. Pense: se n?o houvesse aquela árvore, se Deus n?o tivesse decretado nenhuma lei, e Ad?o quisesse desobedecer a Deus, ele poderia? N?o, n?o há nada a ser desobedecido! é como diz a Lei de nosso país: se n?o há lei q condene um ato, ele n?o pode ser coonsiderado infra??o, isto é, n?o há crime. Da mesma forma, se n?o houver Lei de Deus, n?o há pecado. Mas e se eu quiser pecar? N?o posso! Isso sim é escravid?o, obedecer a alguém por n?o haver outra op??o. Mas Deus n?o faz isso. Ele dá a oportunidade do ser humano de desobedecer a ele, se quiser. Mas antes diz qual a conseqüência de tal ato.<br>  <br>  Veja bem: a condena??o a morte por comer do fruto ou por cometer outro pecado n?o é uma puni?ao ou amea?a. é a conseqüência natural do pecado (o salário do pecado é a morte).

E o pecado faz justamente isso, nos afasta de Deus, pq ele é Santíssimo e, por isso, n?o pode compactuar nem conviver com a menos mancha de pecado.<br>  <br>  Espero q vc se conscientize e saia da escravid?o do pecado e venha para a liberdade q Cristo quer te dar.|`|e00c21a189541fb2f9914f2b11786517aa	é o próprio homem que escraviza a sí próprio quando se entrega somente aos prazeres mundanos, ficando muito preso e esquecendo que tem algo a mais do que só atos inconsequentes!!!<br>  <br>  Deus é o libertador, quem crê em Deus tem a liberdade!!!<br>  bjs|`|p1V9XtUpaa	Jo?o 8:34  Replicou-lhes Jesus: Em verdade, em verdade vos digo: todo o que comete pecado é escravo do pecado.

Por vêzes numa conversa você fala determinada palavra mostrando com os dedos e bra?os levantados que essa palavra é entre aspas. Também pode usar o sinal de interroga??o no final de uma frase durante uma conversa. O Bco Itaú, mostra na sua propaganda a coloca??o de um pingo no I de Itau. Essas formas de falar dando enfase ao que deseja é normal. O italiano fala muito com as m?os. A palavra BASTA por exemplo é sempre seguida com um movimento das m?os. Sua pergunta foi muito boa.
