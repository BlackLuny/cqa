s08UxoITaa	The same thing will happen to a girl as it does a guy when he or she reaches climax.  You pelvic muscles will expand and contract rapidly, which to you would feel really good.  After your climax, you will discharge a fluid, like when guys jack off.
5DB6nOXkaa	most 16 year olds don't really know what "eating healthy" is. You need to do cardio (running, jogging, cycling etc) this will burn fat. Do target excersizes for the abdominal area (crunches etc)
ZXhpEuGpaa	You would think that the parents being overweight would'nt want their children to be that way,especially since you know the parents half to have some sort of health problems because they are overweight,I guess they have become complacent with their lifestyle and it is easier to say that their happy to avoid the task of doing something about it.I just started a new exercise program for 2 reasons i dont want my son to be embarrised by me,and i dont want him to think its okay to endulge in unhealthy food.(i'm not overweight i recently had a baby),trying to lose that belly.lol|`|Nb413oN5aa	Well at least they have not eaten the kids yet.
HgdQMWuDaa	Pushups are more for chest.  For triceps you can grab the edge of a kitchen counter and kitchen island and do dips and for biceps you can curl anything with significant weight as long as it is something balanced.  You could buy an iron gym or a simple pull up bar and use it to do  curls for biceps.  Then when you want a triceps excercise hang there with arms fully extended  and move your knees to your chest. With an iron gym you can also do floor dips.  I just bought one and the days I can't lift at the gym (usually cuz of time) I use it and you can get a good upper body workout in.  Look into it's only like twenty five bucks, and you can get great arms chest and back in a few months.|`|yiJTjc9Xaa	You can get two large coffee (Metal) cans, or juice cans different sizes are good. Fill one can with cement, and stick an iron bar in the center while its still wet. After it drys, fill the other can with cement and stick it on the other end of the steel bar, and youve got a barbell! You can also "Lift and Curl" household items such as water bottles filled with sand or water. Use you imagination! Hope this helps.
HdEnrf0gaa	Virginity is special because it's a gift God gave you.  Take care of it, because when you get married to the one you love, you'll share it with them and it feels beautiful to women when they know it's the right guy. Sometimes when you're not a virgin, the guy you get married to keeps nagging at you that you're easy or that you couldn't wait.|`|838VJJGvaa	I like being a virgin.  Don't gotta worry about the consequences of sex.|`|vYt7LWTvaa	My first time I barely remember, wasn't a big deal. For some people sex is that just sex. Some people are very emotional and put a lot of thought and feelings into. But I am an aquarius which is probably why I don't care.|`|pPNZwbKDaa	Emotional crap, go for it, be safe, the emotions will hit you hard later.|`|MhpccWpmaa	I would hold onto it if I were you and save it for someone I was in love with.  I didn't and it was one of the worst mistakes of my life.  I was dating the boy and he was virgin too but looking back now I was not in love with him and he broke up with me soon after.  Hold onto it, if you don't you'll regret it later.. trust me|`|tBQDHGwmaa	Because making love is such a special thing. You will never forget your first time. It needs to be with someone special. One that you know your going to spend the rest of your life with.  You can get a transmitted disease, and you can get pregnant. Condoms can break.   But still; you shouldn't do it just because it sounds fun or your horny.  Save it for that special someone.  You will regret it later.  Sex is an amazing experience and should be a pleasant memory.  ...Trust me........ Wait and save it for that one person you are truely in love with.    Kendra |`|5p69PPKtaa	I'm 16, and when I had sex for the first time, it felt amazing physically. But emotionally I was so torn up. I kinda still am a bit. Like everyone else has said, I would save sex for someone you really love. If you want to have fun, there are so many more things you could do. You may enjoy it now, but I promise you actions have consequences. Physically, you could get pregnant, or wind up with an STD. As a teenager, it would be so hard on you to handle that physically and emotionally. And emotionally, you can get pretty torn up. Before you know it, you could get caught in a trap of having sex just for the fun of it, and every time it takes a little bit more away from you, makes you a little more numb. I guarantee if you save sex for the one you really love, whom you hopefully will marry, it will be ten times better. You won't have to worry about those consequences.
AA11557192	That's great!  I have not exercised yet myslef :(    But I almost think you may not have eaten enough.  You ate at most 1000 calories?

HdEnrf0gaa	stress is the major cause of menstrual irregularity. of course,stress isn't the only cause of this. if the mechanisms that control ovulation and menstruation aren't mature,and missed periods are common. as women move into there twenties, menstrual cycles usually become regular.    there could be other reasons,like infection,polyps or fibroid.    though the cause of irregularity is usually common and harmless,if it persists more than a few months,you should see your doctor to determine treatment;    the dark blood is old blood.    this might also happen because you are sexually active, and had a miscarriage/|`|xR68iQA9aa	i would definitely go to the doctor, know matter how embarrassing it is.  ask your mom?  unless you cant or you live on your own...|`|tCq1xpqraa	doctor?|`|7be28e60733d4949a504d63eb8e45152aa	black blood is not good, i have been told light pink, red, or even brown is ok.

Go the healthy way and just try to lose 2-3 pounds a week.  Otherwise, your body will think it is starving and your metabolism will shut down to reserve calories - the exact opposite of what you want.|`|hot7qtuGaa	mayb3 a  month, but probly not a w33k and also i dont think th3r3 is any di3t that is "v3ry 3asy", losing and gaining w3ight tak3s awhil3, at l3ast a month to show chang3s
4bkMsT9caa	Toning Exercises: Sit-ups, Crunches, Push-ups, Squats, Jumping Jacks and Jogging, ....even Yoga (switch it up everyday, dont work-out over 1 hour, half hour work-outs are just fine)    What To Eat (vegetarian style) : Stir-fry, stir-fry, and stir-fry ...stir-fry contains healthy and much needed carbs for your work-out ...try putting tofu in your stir-fry ...since you don't eat meat you should already know you should be taking protein and calcium pills on a daily basis to substitute for the lack of those nutrients ...if you don't like the pills, then you need to eat beans everyday (like a 3-bean salad)    good luck...
AA11542500	Your chest is probably more developed than your arms.  Your chest is also made up of larger muscle groups than your arms.  What you should do are isolation exercises for your chest like butterflies but you need a bench and dumbbells or a machine.  Alternatively, you could do push ups with your hands spread out to the side a little more.|`|d46e5bc188a340e7729a4bfdfb5ed476aa	make sure you have been going the full range of motion, you can also try to squeeze the muscle during reps
8ebrivqHaa	Don't eat past 6 PM|`|vUe4N5Y7aa	You need to keep your calorie intake at around 1200 per day.  You are also working out too much.  You are gaining muscle weight while losing fat weight.  So, you wouldn't lose much weight.  Just go for a 45 minute walk every day.  No need to do any more than that.
QKGuNLb4aa	you aren't putting them in far enough. the way i do it is i bend my knees slightly and hold the tampon with my thumb and middle finger...insert the tampon until your fingers touch you and then use your pointer finger to push the tampon in...remove applicator and your good to go|`|lYr1zmQeaa	push it in all the way (the first half of the aplicator is inside you before you take it out) if not try OB tampons in the little boxes, they dont have an applicator so you have to push it in yourself but they are shorter than regular ones, i dont think they're as comfortable to put in or take out though, but they're very handy if you dont want to or cant carry a purse.|`|YJRCC0vbaa	If you can feel the tampon inside you then it's not in far enough. Push it in as far as it will go with your finger. It won't get lost in your body as there's nowhere for it to go so put it in until it will go no further.
qmbm6wlkaa	the 1st time i used one it killed, i did it wrong i could tell straight away but i was really nervous, so i tensed up, and apparently that doesnt help, i would take a deep breath like i did and just pull it out it sounds easier said than done, i know, but itll feel so much better after, and keep tryin, i laid down on my bed, relaxed as much as i could and aimed for the lower part of my back and it went straight in, youll get there just dont force yourself.|`|Ws1qOP1Haa	the tampon is hurting b/c your vag just isnt wet enough so the tampon is pulling on it.Tampons are designed to obsorb. just relax and what a bit if you have a regular flow try in a bit and it shouldnt hurt as much.|`|dZLku4jaaa	this happened to me the first couple of times too. just take a towel or something and bite down really hard and just pull it out its the only way.  if you think that hurt imagine your first time having sex. not being perverted or anything.  hope you get it out lol :]|`|5e6f827c10807a358ec8c468a0da0047aa	umm theres usually a string  if you dont see a string tell ur mom. and what she said ^.^ lol|`|NBf5q2f5aa	ok i know it hurts but its prob up wayy too far or too dry

I dont think you ate too much, but you maybe need more protein, like chicken or fish for dinner instead of a hot pocket...|`|C88VCkvnaa	You didn't eat nearly enough. Your body will go into starvation mode. D: [leading to weight gain]. 1200 is the minimum of calories that needs to be eaten I believe.    Make sure you give your body enough to survive on! Perhaps a bigger lunch/breakfast. ^_^|`|b3FkhOicaa	You are eating very little, you should eat a little more.  You also need a balanced diet, here is a break down of your day:    Fruits: Apple, applesauce (not really a fruit)  Vegetables: Fiber Veggie cracker mix MAYBE, probably not  Protein:   Dairy:  Sugar/Fats/Salts: Pretzels, apple sauce  Grains: oatmeal, pretzels/Fiber Veggie crackers mix, Hot Pocket    As you can see, you need to eat more vegetables, dairy and protein.  Try eggs or meat for protein.  Yogurt, cheese, milk and other dairy products are good too.  Although you didn't consume many calories (and I assume you are counting calories) you will have health problems if you continue to eat like this.    Just try to eat a little of each category in each meal, you will be healthy really soon!|`|plxV97hxaa	You actually ate too little.  Remember to consider the foods you're eating.  Try to stick by a food guide, making sure you get the right amount of servings per day.  You need to add meat/alternative and dairy products into your diet.  More carbs could benefit you as well.|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	You really shouldn't eat less than 1200 calories a day otherwise you risk putting your body in starvation mode.  If you add up what you ate today you only ate about 1040 calories so that is not enough.  You really should add more protein.

9pXiFQMwaa	Well, running outside uses different muscles than the elliptical and bike, so you've been changing the way your body reacts to different work outs. My trainer at NYSC said the elliptical was basically a big toy, and the survey of NYC personal trainers in TimeOut NY a month or so ago had most of them agree that the elliptical doesn't do much of anything. Now, if you've stopped running and just do the indoor stuff, its like you were weight lifting for years, and then stopped and did the bowflex - your body is not being challenged in the right ways anymore and so the muscle mass is decreasing!    All I can say is, when I run on the treadmill in the gym, I know it is simply for cardio, and that I need to run outside for whole body fitness. I can about 5miles on the treadmill but only 3 1/2 outside because working against gravity and your body's own weight is a far better work out, and I can't do as much. If you want to keep your seven mile distance, use the treadmill, and MAKE TIME to run outside! I alternate outside and inside to balance the time issue. When I tell my husband I don't have time, he tells me what I really mean is that I don't prioritize my own future health! (Not trying to be a jerk, honestly, just passing on what trainers have told me)    Also, your comments about food are troubling! As a runner, you must must must eat enough for your body to use as fuel or like other engines without what they need, your body will break down. Even if you don't feel hungry, force yourself to eat an apple, or a protein shake 1 hr before running. Then after the run, eat more protein, veggies, and carbs - you must do this!! As someone who ran cross country, indoor & outdoor track for all 4 years of high school, I can tell you that without food the run will be harder, longer and more punishing than productive!
PnlgLBcwaa	This is this askers response to my question on FMS  INDEPENT ANT SAID (not me)  "I lean towards agreeing with him.......I know 4 women that have it.    All of them had emotional problems before they started having symptoms of it whether they want to believe it of not. Most people that have emotional or mental problems are not capable of recognizing it."    (WHICH BY TEH WAY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE QUESTION!)    I SAY  There is a difference between REAL FMS and other conditions that cause similar symprtoms.    Depression itself can cause pain---people can have both depression and FMS--that does not mean ALL FMS is due to emotional problems--in fact the last statistic I saw said that 50% of people with FMS do not have depression.    My symptoms started when I was 5--and a happy go lucky child-playing baseball with my father, spending summers ona boat, etc.....my symptoms started after a serious physical injury--this contradicts the theory that it is an emotional problem    REAL FMS is a disorder of teh neuro system-    It is highly overdiagnosed by incompetant and lazy docs--and those that specialize in hypochondria--but for many of us-FMS is a real physical disease.    It is not (as fibrofix says) a liver problem, thick body fluids, body acid.    It is not autoimmune, inflammatory, a vitamin deficiency, hormonal.    IT IS a problem with the neuro transmitters (bvrain chemicals) and possibly blood profusion in teh brain.    I have many symptoms that could not be attributred to an emotional problem-real physical symptoms-problems with motor planning, balance, dizziness, my legs giving out, migrainesetc....|`|qDYdSSvIaa	As far as my knowing,it is a question with various answers,it is definitely depending on the your mind ,providing a great resource here http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in... for reference though.

The most common reason for pain is lack of lubrication.  Make sure you have enough foreplay because when you are turned on it really decreases the friction.

Its most likely because of lack of lubrication though so don't worry.|`|InfvT0fiaa	one. are you on birth control?  i am. and this is an unfortunate side effect that some  birth controls have (in which case i suggest talking to your doctor  or whoever about possibly changing?)  and two. there is also just a simple condition that i remember  reading about somewhere  i dont remember what its called but the jidts of it is that  now and then it will become extra sensitive and dry which leads to the  pain (at first i thought i had this but then  i was talking to my friend about it who's a practicing nurse   and she mentioned the birth control thing and surprise!)|`|175ydQo5aa	you might have a tilted uterus which can be uncomfortable at certain angles, go your Gyno and ask her to take a look.|`|9pXiFQMwaa	It could be the shape of your vaginal walls, maybe your uterus is tilted one way or the other too far and so it hurts. The best advice is for you to tell your OBGYN and let them do an assessment and tell you what's going on. Be very frank and explain your pain. I know my pelivis is tilted so different positions are far less 'fun' than others, and we compensate for that. But your problem sounds more severe and only an OBGYN would know for sure.  Good Luck!|`|QKGuNLb4aa	it sounds to me that he is hitting  your cervix.... try other positions but make sure he doesn't go in all the way.  my husband and i have the same problem and that's what we do. i hope it helps :)
R9OfKCEjaa	I wouldn't go on it until you are ready to become sexually active or unless you have severe period problems.    The best way for the body to be is free to do what nature intended. Don't start pumping it full of man-made chemicals until you actually need to, to prevent getting pregnant etc.    Go on it eventually, but not until it's really necessary.|`|OikNR8Ufaa	NO!! DONT DO IT!!! hormones can seriously mess you up!! The first time I went on birth control I puked my guts up for about 3 days straight and ended up in hospital. Then I tried another kind that I thought were okay, but they made me so angry and stressed, I tried another kind, made me super super depressed. Then they started giving me terrible headaches and I woke up one morning, half my body was limp and I could barely speak, doc reckons I may have had a mini-stoke from it, I'm okay now and on another kind of pill which they usually only give to older woman which has stopped my period completely. I went on the pill because of my bad period pains and they never helped at all, even this one i'm on now I keep getting the pains even though no period.    So really, until you are sexually active I really wouldn't take them, they mess around with your hormones and can change you completely, I guess maybe I've had worse experiences than most, but I would encourage anyone to risk screwing themselves up with these pills like that. It's not worth it. I'd wait and consider it again when you meet that special man who you really love and are ready to start making love.    I hope this kinda helped, maybe your mum just see's how many young girls are walking around with babies these days and doesnt want you to be like that, more than anything, prove to her that you are sensible enough to not need these pills. good luck! xx|`|GhETSRdUaa	They don't need to take your blood to put you on birth control. They just shove a Q tip up you, and it doesn't hurt at all.     It might be a good idea, because it regulates your period.|`|175ydQo5aa	its better to be safe, BC will help with acne if you have it, and I hear it makes your boobs bigger, so I dont see a downside.|`|Zf18VjlCaa	Getting your blood taken isn't anything. I have an intense fear of needles but have no problem getting blood drawn.  Personally,myself,  I wouldn't go on it. It did nothing but cause me problems, messed up my periods, made me sick... and all that. You might have a different experience.  I think your mom wants you on it, in case you decide to start having sex. She's a smart woman. Seriously, she doesn't want you knocked up at 16 and in this day and age it's all too common. Go, talk to the ob/gyn see what they have to say. You don't have to go on it, but I would strongly advise it just in case you do accidentally have sex... that way, you don't accidentally ruin your life.|`|InsYyclPaa	just because you're not sexually active doesn't mean it isn't useful. I've been on birth control since I was 14 because I've always had bad cramps and heavy periods. Birth control helps control your cycle, it makes it more regular, more bearable, and helps with cramping. Some are even said to help symptoms of PMDD which is basically severe PMS. if a blood test isn't worth it to you its your call. I personally never had to get a blood test to be put on the pill nor a papsmear. Your doctor can discuss all the options and different kinds of birth control available.|`|EbNQDAHPaa	Hi,    I was 15 when my parents put me on the pill (I am now 23 and just recently came off of it). They did it whether I was going to be sexually active soon or not, they didnt want to take any chances. They trusted me to make the right decisions, but wanted me to have regular periods (with barely any pms symptoms) and protected from pregnancy when I did decide to have sex. It was a smart decision on their part. I didnt have to miss school for cramps during my period and I always knew when it was going to arrive! I would talk to your doctor and research it a little. Just a personal story :) I wish you well and respect your decision to have sex later on.

hR1wc0taaa	you are seeking lean muscle mass  you REALLY need to work hard for a few months to transition from the thighs you have now to the leaner type you seek.  be sure to treat yourself with high protein after a workout, and pay attention to your calorie intake  there is really no other way  once you get there, you have to expend effort to maintain it. believe me, it goes back on REAL easy. [over the holidays, I gained back 10 lbs, took me a month to get them off]
GT6396BDaa	Protein shakes and supplements are great if they are balanced with a healthy diet.  Usually, the best time to have a protein drink is about 30 minutes to an hour before you work out.  It's a great energy source and will help with lifting weights or and cardio(running, joggin) workouts.  The important thing is not to have too many shakes or power bars because they do have a high calorie count.  Some people think they can have as many as they want during the day, because they are "healthy".  The purpose of them is to be a supplement, like have 1 or 2 a day before you workout.    Also, having healthy meals are important too.  An example is for breakfast, having a high fiber cereal or oatmeal, or if you like eggs, try egg whites or 1 whole egg(with yolk) with an egg white.  Whole grain toast is ok, and fruit. For lunch, grilled chicken or turkey with a salad or steamed veggies with soy sauce is great. If you like sweets, of course fruits and yogurt with almonds or nuts are good.  For dinner, eat a light dinner.  Eat fish, or even chicken or lean beef is good for you.    The most important thing to remember when you are wanting to lose fat and build muscle is moderation.  Don't eat big meals.  Instead, have snacks or small meals, like a protein drink or bar.  Or if you like nuts, fruit, etc., to help keep you from over eating or getting too much fat in your diet.  If you crave sweets or salty snacks, it's ok to have 1 or 2 cookies or eat low fat cookues or brownies.  They taste just as good as the regular ones.  Or have cheese popcorn or pretzels and baked chips with salsa.  You don't have to deprive yourself.  Just make good choices.  I know I am saying more than you wanted to know, but it just seemed like you needed some help with more than just information about protein shakes.  So, workout on a schedule if you can, eat in moderation, use protein drinks and supplements for just as they say, "Use as a supplement."    Just about everything has fats, but you need some fats and sugars for energy when you work out and they will burn off as long as you eat in moderation and do a consistent work out schedule.  I know I probably said more than you were asking, but I've been a training for for over 20 years, and involved in athletics my entire life.  The main thing to remember is do everything in moderation.  Have 1 or 2 of protein upplements a day, whatever you like best, shakes, bars or supplements.  They are a great energy source before you work out.  Best of luck.  Keep up the good work.  Just be patient, within a few weeks you will notice your body toning uo and changing from fat to muscle.  One quick note. Muscle weighs more than fat, so at first you may lose weight fast but as you build muscle, the pounds lost won't be as much but your body is building muscle mass.  Best of luck. Remember eat healthy and take protein shakes or supplements in moderation.  Hope I helped and gave you some useful information.|`|QC7UHPKXaa	When using protein shakes and supplements its always best to work out with it cause if you don't yes it will make you gain weight.But I have always heard that if you want to gain muscle you drink protein shakes and work out.To burn more fat its great to run or jog or walk.I've noticed that just by working out your muscles you don't get rid of fat as fast but add running or something to it and you'll see the pounds melt away.
a76629fcd8dd30887d6f5348489ce42faa	I started lifting when I was 15, I'm now 45.  When I started I did what I was told and gained some muscle, but not enough.  What we new about training then was nothing compared to what we know now.    I experimented with many different routines and have found that one thing is a constant for gaining muscle.    If you want tp put on muscle - LIFT THE HEAVIEST WEIGHTS YOU CAN.    I've outlined this routine many times on this forum, and I bet you can't follow this routine and not put on muscle.    Set 1 - 12 reps, very easy (too easy), its a warm up set  Set 2 - 10 reps, still fairly easy  Set 3 - 8 reps, quite hard 9-10 reps would be the absolute max you could lift at this weight  Set 4 - 6 reps, very, very, did I say very, hard.  I tell people the sixth rep should be the very last rep you could do.  Set 5 - 12 reps. Same weight as set 1, but because you're exhausted from set 4 this will seem extremely hard.  Set 6 - to failure. Same weight as sets 1 & 5.  Almost immediately after set 5, pick the same weight again and go until you can't move your arms. (It is going to hurt, but don't whimp out and push until your done).    Lower Abs  - reverse crunches    lay on floor  bring thighs to vertical  lower thighs towards floor (approx. 12 inches)  bring thighs back to vertical    do 3 sets to failure - unlike other body parts I like to train abs this way.  So I don't build a huge bulging stomach.|`|YQgSrJI6aa	Weigh. It's makes you gain weight, and gives you muscle (I only know this because my brother takes it). You can mix it with Milk, Water etc. or whatever you want.  You can buy it at a fitness store. Go in and talk to them too about it too.  Best of Luck|`|CGJ68TIXaa	hey. same with me. im  16 and was 124. but now  136 . i started working out 1 year 6 months ago. i work out 2 times a week now. but before (2 months ago i used to work out every 2 days. it helped me. most exercises i did was benching 180lb. than lifted weights. for bicepts. 70lb. also i do pullups for wings. i do around 25. also full crunches or situps. 100 in morning. sometimes i do pushups. max i can do is 52. i used to drink protein shakes. but no i dont. sometimes i buy protein bars at work. so basicaly u can do exercises which i wrote. also you should eat fish, chicken, tuna and you can buy protein powder. you can buy creatine for faster results but its not healthy for your body. just work out every 2 days. or when you feel that your not sore and your body is energized.|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !    I just answered a question just like this one. I am going to give you the same answer.     Increasing your intake of junk foods and greasy foods is not a good way to gain weight. Even though you need to increase your calorie consumption to gain weight, those calories should come from foods that are good for you.   Healthy fats include omega-3 essential fatty acids sources like tuna, salmon, flax, and walnuts. Good sources of protein include lean meats, fish, poultry, nuts, seeds and legumes. Healthy carbohydrate sources include fruits, vegetables and whole grains.   It may be easier to eat five or six smaller balanced meals per day rather than eating three large meals, especially if you are not used to eating much at one sitting. It would also be a healthy idea to add a small amount of flax seed oil and some psyllium powder to add some omega-3 essential fatty acids and extra fiber.   Exercise is also important for healthy weight gain. Resistance training exercises such as lifting weights will help to increase your muscle size. Aerobic exercises such as running and stationary bicycling are better for fat loss and excessive aerobic training may cause you to lose more weight.  Use these tips and tools to help gain weight:  Add healthy calories to breakfast with an extra slice of whole-grain toast and peanut butter.   Mid-morning and afternoon snacks should be nutritious, not junk. Trail mixes contain healthy nuts, dried fruits and can add healthy calories to your diet.   Don't add calories to your meals by choosing unhealthy fried foods such as french fries, chicken nuggets and fish sticks. Choose healthy foods such as baked potatoes, baked chicken and fish, just make your portions a bit bigger.   Keep your meals balanced. One meal should have a healthy protein source such as fish, low fat meat, chicken or legumes plus two or three servings of vegetables. Green vegetables add lots of vitamins and phytonutrients while starchy potatoes and corn add extra calories.   Drink healthy beverages such as milk and fruit juices to add calories. Don't choose sugary sodas, which only add calories and no nutrition.   Design a weight training program with help from About.com's exercise site.|`|9YAWWrMHaa	you can use muscle milk its not like a steroid its just a protein mixture and protein helps build muscle. and for the lower abs you can do leg lifts
9pLdhuBnaa	There are several possibilities for what could have caused this such as from a hormone imbalance (an example only).    I would recommend seeing your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.
RnhAWXHzaa	You can get hepatitis from making out, since it can be transmitted through saliva. But that's about all you can contract from making out, unless you or the other person has an open sore or something, then don't do it. Yeah you wont get any STI/STD if you or your partner are 100% sure you don't have one. But ya know, just to be on the safe side.

f51d44e105a2a3f4397e420c549a4437aa	You go girl!!!!  I do think the emphasis on clothing sizes and  actual pounds, rather than on health and fitness, is definitely sending bad messages.  The important thing is, YOU are happy and healthy.  It probably shows in how you carry yourself and present yourself to others, and it gets you noticed.  Be proud, stand tall, and if you get the chance, share your experience with someone who may benefit from what you know.  I remember when Queen Latifa was a spokesperson for Jenny Craig.  She would not use pounds to describe her success, nor divulge her actual weight.  Her catch phrase was "A size healthier."  I loved it, and I wish the company would do more like that.|`|48Yf8tpsaa	You're tall and I bet you carry that 180 pounds wonderfully and deliciously. What is important is how healthy you are. A BMI scale is really just an averaging guage. Individuals can and do fit outside the guidelines even if they are very healthy. In fact, most athletes with a bit of muscle do not fit the BMI profile... too heavy.. on account of the muscle mass.    For guys, if his waist line is wider than his hips.. then the averages show that he is lining up for a heart disease. Put this with older age, high blood pressure and high cholesterol and you've got a walking corpse on your hands... time to hit the gym stat.    I have always been a man attracted to a beautifully curvacious siren... you gals just look so ... naughty!|`|gQ8EMW8gaa	me too!|`|TNbhUSAIaa	Because a lot of people are easily swayed.  They think, this is what everyone else thinks, so should I.    Who cares?!  If you know that you are in shape, good looking, and are okay with it, what difference does it make?  Besides, it helps thin out the heard!    Any other questions, just message me :)    People are always surprised to find out that I way almost 140, I'm only 5'6", I should weigh like, 125.  MUSCLE WEIGHS MORE THAN FAT :D|`|teSTpOQeaa	rock on girl!  you're awesome and you should be the role model of today...not these 5'11" 90 pounds girls that look like twigs.|`|4CsGde1qaa	I understand exactly what you mean. People like Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears and many others should be left alone. I can't honestly say that being fat is always cool, because most of the time I think it's not, but then again who cares what I think? I am not God, so my opinion is not one that should be followed. If someone says you are fat, it is not an actual opinion, it is an insult.
NICEuXYgaa	If you are worried about the oreo... Don't be!  You are only 13 your body is going to change a lot through out the next couple of years.  If you are that concerned about it I would suggest you not eat so much fruit.  Fruit is very high in sugar and yes it is good for you, but too much of it and not enough protein is going to make you gain weight.  And always eat breakfast... always!  If you don't your metabolism is going to decrease greatly and that will also put some more weight on.  I am a personal trainer and my husband is a model.  He is your height and he weighs about 170 and healthy.  No one likes skin and bones.  Your doing the right thing though worry about your homework and school for now!|`|ykeCqwfoaa	Wow, you're thirteen and you're 6 foot!!! I'm pretty tall, but not like that. Anyway, but 6 foot, 138 is the minimum you should weigh. It might even be under the minimum for BMI (Body mass index). You're not fat. If you really want to get back to 129, then you can't "break down and forget about healthy eating." If you really want to be a model, then you just can't eat junk food. You didn't say what you wanted to tone... Anyway, good luck with your modelling career!
XvGQq1gBaa	The workout frequency is great.  I like the protein usage, it helps retain muscle.  In order to get cut like that guy(Van Wilder lol) you need to add 30 min of rigorous cardio 5 days a week.  If you take supplements I would invest a diet supplement of some sort.  I hope that helps.

pzLDXL6gaa	That's bizarre. I don't know if she was just uncomfortable or what - either way she doesn't sound like a very good pharmacist. Then again they don't really deal with some methods of birth control, only prescription medication ones, so they might be confused that you were picking them as an expert.    Pharmacists can't actualy prescribe drugs, they can only dispense prescriptions given by a doctor.    Go to a new pharmacist if you were unhappy.    Harriet|`|3CCIcS6Oaa	Go to a different pharmacist|`|DsLx6Sixaa	Get your facts straight. Pharmacists do not "write prescriptions" nor do they "prescribe drugs"    Pharmacists are not doctors. They can not write prescriptions or prescribe drugs.    Only doctors can write a prescription or prescribe drugs. Pharmacists only give drugs to people who already have a prescription which was written by a doctor.    It is pretty hard to believe that a pharmacist had not heard of different types of birth control. If this is really true, you must have been speaking to a very poorly trained assistant.
XvGQq1gBaa	You can also buy it on the flatbellydiet.com website (it's a little less expensive there and they offer free shipping and 21-day free trial). However you purchase this book, it is well worth the price. The book first explains the basic principles of the Flat Belly Diet (which I can tell you from first hand experience is very effective for targeting belly fat): Eat a MUFA at every meal (you know, monounsaturated fats, like olives, olive oil, dark chocolate, avocado, certain nuts); limit your meals to 400 calories; don't go more than four hours without eating. That's it! Obviously there are refinements, and more rules to help you get the most out of the diet, but at heart it is a simple, flexible, diet that works.

cb2NxPERaa	No, it's not normal to be 161 (140 would be normal). You should stop drinking that much water, it's bad for your electrolytes. Try to drink about 11 glasses A DAY.

But there is a pill called Diflucan that can be taken, and while I am not 100% sure I am pretty sure that it can be taken even if you have diabetes.

XvGQq1gBaa	It depends on what your goal is.  Im guessing to lose weight.  The answer to your question yes it is a good Idea to use protein.  Choose a protein that has the least amount of calories as possible.  Protein does not make you fat.  I would use a serving in the mourning, after you workout, and at night before you go to bed.  The key to lose weight is to do cardio and eat many small caloric meals throughout the day(preferably high in protein).  I hope that helps a lil bit.
fIEmi84Laa	Losing 20 pounds might not be as easy for you as it is for someone who is, for example, 250 pounds or 300 pounds. Do you drink water? I hate water, but one thing that help me lose alot of weight was drinking a glass of ice cold water in the morning. And drinking one right before I go to bed. I rarely drink water during the day. Also, have a small meals, but snack alot. Don't drink soda. Eat Fiber One cereal (you can mix it with a different kind of cereal and add strawberries, blueberries, or bananas and tastes amazing). Exercise in the morning. There's really no best time to exercise, but try getting some done in the morning. It puts you in a good mood, and you're more likely to eat less during the day. I would also recommend Phentermine, but that really depends if your parents are willing to get it for you.|`|TBEM9Ne1aa	HEY     YOU CAN EAT ALOT OF FRUIT SALSA AND WATER IS VERY GOOD AND IF YOU EAT MEAT PUT IT  IN THE OVEN OK|`|gwjBvXTbaa	Sweetie, how tall are you?

AA12113808	It doesn't mean that your training is ineffective, just not as effective as it might be.  Muscle soreness is a sign that you're tearing down the muscle fibers, forcing them to rebuild bigger and stronger.  If your muscles are not getting sore after a workout, you are probably not pushing them hard enough.  This means you should increase the weight that you perform exercises with (not increasing sets/reps).    Studies have shown that workout intensity is the number one factor in stimulating myodilation (muscle growth).  Intensity means putting up as much weight as you can for as many reps as you can.  This translates into sets of 6-8 reps until failure followed by several forced repetitions (a spotter helps you lift the weight after you have reached muscle failure with the full weight).  Of course make sure you are warmed up properly before attempting any heavy weights.  With this kind of training, you should experience extreme strength and muscularity gains (assuming you follow proper nutrition for a weightlifter).  High-intensity training allows you to workout much less often as your muscles and nervous system need more time to recover following your workout.  You should not work any particular muscle group more than once in a 5-day period.    So, basically, lift harder and heavier and you'll get better results.|`|09a4e8f465bc5e969d0dfbcd214b2b3faa	i was once told by a doctor that the old saying of no pain no gain is wrong.

It can sometimes signal that you have overtrained.  If you are varying your workouts than you should be fine.  Measure your success by strength gains, visible muscular gains, or how pumped you got the muscle.|`|476abc8e1d7d41d876e9e1413cb7f65baa	No mate, it means that your body is simply more effective at forming the cross bridges required for the sliding filament mechanism of muscular contraction. Your weight training has, in effect, given you a more effective muscular system and the recovery process of your muscles has become more efficient because of your training. When you do have a break from training, it is very tempting to return to training at the level you left at, this is where problems and injuries occur, as the body is not conditioned to the exercise due to the break in training.|`|AA11617855	Just because you aren't sore doesn't mean your muscles have recovered completely.  The better shape you get in the less you will be sore.|`|AA10814202	no ur weight traiining is def effective|`|AA10238008	It doesn't mean that at all. You just need to do more reps and vary it up a li'l bit more. Even change the days you do it because trust me, your body can tell when you do arms one day, kickboxing the next and legs the next and repeat this over nad over and over. Try upping the amount of weights you use as well. Lastly, and most importantly, however, make sure you haven't slacked up on using the proper form when you exercise. Without hte proper form, you'll have one of two things,   *you won't be sore at all  *you'll be sore in the wrong places.    Good luck and just remember to not give up on your weight training.|`|AA10421008	No. It just means that you're muslces are becoming stronger and recovering more quickly  .

Its possible for someone to be THIN but not fit.  Exercise makes a person healthier and helps reduce the risks of other health problems such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.  Person B may need to exercise more than person A if person B is trying to lose weight, but its a good idea for everyone to get 30 min of exercise at least 3-4 days a week...if not more.|`|baff4b91c5355cac5cd4599c7ca96be9aa	I imagine that it would depend on why the exercise was needed, and what the end goal was.

But doctors have different standards for deciding if a patient is under-nourished, well nourished, or obese, than do most females.

Excercises can strengthen muscles, loosen joints, improve cardiac and GI function, improve skin conditions, lots of things, even improve mental health, especially depression.

cb28ec3dd23e46f943fccae9851d36feaa	Jumping higher involves the fast-twitch muscle fibers, so regular weight training will not be as effective as plyometric (explosive) training. Before you attempt plyometrics I highly recommend doing compound movements for the whole body, using a 15-20 rep range with perfect form at fast speeds for at least 8 - 12 weeks. Remember that form is paramount. At fast speeds you can damage your joints if you are not careful, but training at slow speeds will not affect the fast-twitch fibers. Plyometrics are great, but you have to be in good conditioning and do it scientifically or you will injure yourself. You need to buy a DVD called Jumping into Plyometrics. The subject is to big and complicated to explain in a few paragraphs. This video will improve your jumping ability!|`|242bc68887ebc240fb694218923dffceaa	use a trampoline|`|4550966ef5322ec7aab4250d69dfcd7faa	BEND YOUR KNEES AND SPRING.|`|a06efa1b6069d9451feb98a440e12b35aa	The best exercises are jumping exercises.

Make sure you stretch them also by leaning against a wall flat-footed and lean forward toward the wall while your feet are flat on the floor.    Gyms should have a cool calf machine to use. Good luck|`|bbb575f3d8b10972572e83f2994debe9aa	To jump higher, beging by building strength in your quads, hamstrings and calves. Do some ankle exercises. Don't forget to work on your core strength and upper body. If I had to break it down, I would say about 10% of your vertical motion comes from your calves, 10% from swinging your arms when you jump, and 80% from your thighs. Hope that helps!

a7388b8105fd0d5f6b50089e46397422aa	one other thing to consider when you use those body fat scales is whether you have gone to the bathroom or not. Since the scale is measuring the conductivity of your body from one foot to the other, having a bladder full of water will also change the readings.    first of all, stretching will generally not do much for a body fat reading. Walking is good exercise but if you started at a certain fitness level, it might not be improving anything if you don't increase the volume or intensity. Has your weight gone up or down in this time. What might be happening, based on the exercises you list, is that you could be losing weight and muscle mass at the same time. If the fat doesn't go away at the same rate as the muscle, your body fat ratio will go up. The body is very stubborn about using up its fat reserves. Sometimes it is more willing to burn muscle first if you don't give it a reason to keep it.    Do some weight lifting exercises with your legs, increasing the weight over time as it gets easier and you should notice an improvement in the body fat measurement.|`|AA10476683	i dont put any faith in those contraptions. if you want to know your weight get a cheap scale that works, and if you think your size (not weight) is changing chalk it up to girl  problems, or just go on a crash diet and lose a pound or 2. personaly i think if your so conserned about  your weight you have an eating problem, either your too over weight or severly underweight. if all else fails go to your family doctor|`|ef6eea8fbd885ddcf8d1d304bc36b7a3aa	Send me a pic and ill judge if your fat.

If you do the body fat check in the morning, you may be dehydrated and it will show you lower in weight but higher in fat. If you do it right after you're done exercising, your body fat will appear higher. With a scale that uses electrical impedence, it's best to check the body fat percentage in the evening on a day when you haven't worked out.

Only the size of your fist, carbs (examples:baked potato, pasta, oatmeal, beans, corn, melon, apples, fat free yogurt, whole wheat breads)in one and protien (examples:chicken breast, swordfish, shrimp, turkey breast) in the other. You can also eat vegetables and salads with any meal, they dont have none or little fat). 30min cardo exercise every day. Any of these(examples: walking, jogging, swimming,running, biking, ect), Monday cardo, tues upper body (arms: curls, tricep extensions,pull ups, front press)(abdominals: leg pull crunch, leg raises), (chest: bench press, butterfly, pullover)(shoulders: front press, arm pullover, cross county skier machine)(back:seated row, lat pull downs, back extension)(YOU DONT HAVE TO DO IN ONE DAY, mix it up) wed cardo, thurs lower body (legs: leg pull,leg press, squats, lounges) fri cardo, sat upper. Sunday eat anything you want and dont exercising, you do this on sunday so your body doesnt go into starvation mode. YOU NEED TO TAKE SUNDAY OFF. If you stilck with this you will have a great body. also drink aleast 8oz of water daily! Stay away from Mcdonals, Wendys, ect because there is nothing good for you on the menu's even the salads are bad (beaon bits, cheeze, dressing, ect) Good Luck :)

b9dab86ecd6bc5afaac7a1ecf3af2b78aa	Among several muscles being used to lift weight while bench pressing are the pectoral muscles which are the chest muscles.|`|085620a79219e5fd8933cb99b3d0aa4faa	so i already know you can bench, and now your question is how you wanna FEEL it in your chest ? so i wont bore you with technique of breathing, speed of raising the bar and lowering it,hand placement, etc..etc.. ok here it is..     1) do you know how to flex your biceps ? making really rip hard when someone ask you to flex it..   2) ok can you do that to your tricep ? squeeze your tricep really hard.   3) now can you flex your pectorals the same as you did for your arms ? best is squeeze both pectorals when you are done with a set and not concentrating on squeezing it when you are doing the set. this should set you hypertrophying very soon. hope to see you with bigger chest . Cheers.|`|AA11159703	The bench press is a compound exercise, meaning its not isolating a single muscle group.  It works  the shoulders, triceps and pectorals(chest).  If you are just starting out, your chest may not have much strength so you compensate by putting more strain in your shoulders and arms to begin with. After a while, even though you may not feel it, your chest will get stronger and take more of the weight so your arms and chest are working equally rather than your arms doing all the work..|`|AA11124274	Use the appropriate ammount of weight, reos and proper form. You need to estimate your 1 rep max- which means about how much weight could you lift in that position only once? (you'd jsut about collapse after picking up that ammount of weight, and i do mean estimate, you shouldn't just try to figure out by lifting....guess...if you can do only 1 push up and you weigh 140lbs, your one rep max for chest press is probably about 120)  Then, in order to gain muscular benefits, you'd use a certain percentage depending on your desired goal.    Goal:                       % of weight to use:       Reps:        Pace:  "get ripped"               30-60%                       12-18         moderate   endurance                 20-40%                       15-25        moderate  (to lift over and over again in one sittiting)  Power                       60-80%                         3-6           Fast  (to lift about 5 times really fast)    Now, as far as form goes, lying the bench, keep your feet an equal distance apart, firmly planted on the floor.  Typically hands should be directly over your elbows (although you can change your grip for different efffects).  Engage your abdominals for support - think of pulling your navel in towrads your spine. Press your shoulder blades/upper back down into the bench. Be sure your back doesn't arch off the bench (if it does, your weight is too high and you need to strengthen your abs).  Inhale, exhale to press up. Count to two as you press up, hold at the top for two, and take four counts to lower as you inhale(for the moderate paced goals).  If you are using the right ammount of weight, your arms should start to quiver by your 8th-12th press. THat's called overload and its healthy, but use a spotter just incase.|`|04c4b39930689825182f414f89be1727aa	when you are on the pushing part you need to squeeze your pec muscles. try to tighten them as much as you can and hold it for 1-2 seconds then back down slow and do it again.|`|AA12111168	make sure your using the appropriate weight along with proper form and grip. if you're using more weight that you can handle,   you could possibly be using different muscles more so than your chest, example shoulders and triceps.

085620a79219e5fd8933cb99b3d0aa4faa	this book is really good, and i recommend it the book is calld Body for Life and it is a 12-week diet and exercise program, and also an annual physique transformation competition. It was created by Bill Phillips, a former competitive bodybuilder and the founder of EAS, a manufacturer of nutritional supplements. It has been popularised by a bestselling book of the same name.    The first annual Body for Life competition was held in 1996. (It was then called the "EAS Grand Spokesperson Challenge".) Entrants write about their experience of the program, and send this to EAS along with their 'before' and 'after' swimsuit photos. Prizes vary each year, but in 2005 the first prize was US$1,000,000.    Body for Life makes use of principles that have been widely known in bodybuilding already. Its differences are in the way it has been packaged and marketed so as to appeal to consumers and be understood by the public. It supports an extensive ancillary industry of gyms, nutritionists and personal trainers.|`|8ad709140b196e36b4ff417a71a9243aaa	You dont need a book to show you the best routine. And by the way there isnt a general "best routine". Do you work with dumbells?  Let me give you a site which shows exercises on all of your body parts.   http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/exercise...    First decide on how many days you are willing to train in a week and which body parts you want to improve. Then find which exercises you can perform in your home. Develope routines which you can finish in "1 hour" with little rest(not more than 10 sec). "1 hour" is important because after 1 hour you begin to destroy the muscle you have built. Eat alot of protein and stay away from sugar! If you want to really shape your body after your 1 hour routine rest for 15-20 minutes then do a cardio(running,swimming....etc).   At first dont push yourself to much because you will become sore all over the next day and decide to quit eventually.  If your  first aim is to look good do alot of reps (ex.  4 x 12)  If your first aim is to get strong lift heavy with less reps(ex. 3 x 6)     The best routine for you is the one which tires you out in 1 hour.    NOTE: MUSCLES DEVELOPE WHEN RESTING. so if you have a chance after your excersize take a good shower(warm at the beging cold in the end) the take a good nap.
AA10405966	Eat healthy foods, think about what kinds of food you find on the outer ring of the grocery store.  (Veggies, Fruit)  Remove all enriched flour and sugars.

fd9e501af776cf3104f809f770a681a7aa	Exercise that pushes your heart rate closest to your targeted heart rate is the most suitable exercise to get rid of fat. You should exercise with sufficient intensity to raise your pulse rate, which in turn speeds up the fat loss process. The exercises that bring your heart rate close to your targeted heart rate will boost your metabolism, which will lead to fat loss.Besides, making you look better, weight loss offers hosts of other health benefits. When you reduce 10-15% of your weight, your chances of suffering from heart attack, diabetes as well as cholesterol levels go down. Hence if you are thinking of getting started, the best time to get started is now.Commitment is the most crucial factor to get any exercise program started.    Do cardio exercises for 30-60 minutes at least 3-4 times per week. Regularly working out for a month will increase your energy levels, improve your mood and reduce your waist size. Commitment will also help you to choose the best exercise that will aid your fat loss.Vary your exercise routine. This will make your workout exciting, thus increasing your motivation.

085620a79219e5fd8933cb99b3d0aa4faa	Sesamin oil is marketed as an all-natural and stimulant-free athletic performance enhancing supplement that builds muscle, burns fat, and improves athletic endurance and exercise performance    Because sesamin extract use is new, little scientific study to date has substantiated its effectiveness, but existence science suggest that sesamin holds promise as a beneficial, health enhancing ingredient, and that it may help support healthy hormone profile, healthy muscle tone, healthy weight management, and healthy immune system function    Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a naturally occurring group of dienoic derivatives of linoleic acid found in the fat of beef and other ruminants. CLA is reported to have effects on both tumor development and body fat in animal models. To further characterize the metabolic effects of CLA, male AKR/J mice were fed a high-fat (45 kcal%) or low-fat (15 kcal%) diet with or without CLA (2.46 mg/kcal; 1.2 and 1.0% by weight in high- and low-fat diets, respectively) for 6 wk. CLA significantly reduced energy intake, growth rate, adipose depot weight, and carcass lipid and protein content independent of diet composition. Overall, the reduction of adipose depot weight ranged from 43 to 88%, with the retroperitoneal depot most sensitive to CLA. CLA significantly increased metabolic rate and decreased the nighttime respiratory quotient. These findings demonstrate that CLA reduces body fat by several mechanisms, including a reduced energy intake, increased metabolic rate, and a shift in the nocturnal fuel mix.     Hope this answer your question, Cheers
GhsqaXsdaa	If he has pain give him children's Tylenol. Tell your friend not to worry, it is very commen, and it often happens when teeth will not fall out/ grow the way they are supposed to, but don't get into a panic. There is nothing serious about this, infact the worst thing that could happen is his teeth growing a little crooked and him needing braces when hes older. No biggy. Just bring him to the dentist one of these days.|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	It's called an ectopic eruption,and it's not all that uncommon to see if this is a front tooth.  It's going to need the dentist exam to make sure this is actually what is happening, though.  In a lot of cases, it will actually correct itself once the baby tooth is gone.  In some cases they need to do more encouragement.  I had this happen with both of my canine teeth.  One corrected itself, the other one was sort of wired and "encouraged" to shift into place over several months time.  I was young then, so don't have a clear memory of the time or procedure- but I don't remember it being particularly traumatic.   It's not exactly normal, but it's not weird abnormal either.  It's just one of those things that happens sometimes.  Just try to help her stay calm until the dentist does the exam. A lot of times things look worse than they are, and when it's your child, you do get grey at the edges.  But as in my case, it's usually not a big deal to correct.  By the way, all my kids' teeth came in just fine.|`|RoDjZKknaa	At about age six he will get his first permanent molars, this is likely what is coming through the gum tissue.  The two baby molars in front of that won't be lost for a while yet. Usually the bottom front teeth are lost, then the top front teeth.  Then the ones to each side of those.  The canines are lost later.  He will get the permanent 6 year molar without losing anything and the first and second bicuspids will eventually come in to take the place of the primary - aka "baby" - molars.   About age 12 he will get his second permanent molars, again, no tooth will be lost for this one to come in.  They start with 20 primary aka "baby" teeth and end up with 32 permanent teeth (includes 3rd molars, aka "wisdom" teeth)   Hope that answers your questions.  the biggest problem is keeping the chewing surface of those teeth clean as they erupt through the gums.  If the tissue covers them too long they can often have decay in them by the time they fully surface.     good luck

2622a71159b5d0b9e3f1310e8a42eae2aa	my teeth were so jacked up that  had them for 6 years when i was younger. the day i got them taken off i cried cause i missed them so much. at first they may look a little goofey, but u can get colored bands to match your outfits and make it fun. after your teeth look a little better, braces look real cute! dont worry, they will look real cute and u will grow to love them!|`|298574ebd480e066c2b6e29e1c578b4aaa	Your biggest problem, like many other insecure people, is caring what others think of you or what others say. People who make fun of you are insecure with themselves. People who care what others say about them or to them are also insecure with themselves.     Braces are a temporary hinder for a permanent fix. If I had the chance to wear braces to straighten my teeth as a teen, I would have jumped on the opportunity. Stop worry about what others think or say. You'll have the last laugh with a beautiful smile the rest of your life.|`|85719f00faedbb1def8e68085dd432e1aa	Do you want janky teeth for the rest of your life, or do you want to have braces for a short amount of time so you can have a beautiful smile the rest of your life?      ...Yea, that's what I thought.    Don't be so self-conscious. If your friends are really your friends they won't make fun of you, and if they do, well, I guess they're not your true friends.|`|1ab1bb8fce695c516985e2458c4343beaa	yeah well..u wont be judged..braces are too common now. most people have them. braces are actually cute. and ugly betty is a movie. movies over dramatize what really happens in life, like high school. i dont know abotu u, but the high school in those movies is nothing like mine.|`|AA11100047	Try going to a Chiropractor. They can adjust you so your teeth line up straight without the use of braces. I would attempt to get complete information from a Chiropractor on how they can help  before going ahead.
IhABjhx5aa	some girls do start later, but seventeen is really late.   Yes, go see the doctor.   some cause could be that she is underweight though, so if so, that could be your reason.. but still 100% see a doctor.|`|Kc0SO4Kwaa	I agree with everyone above. She should go see a doctor. I got mine when I was 11. 17 is really late....|`|anC0pVOQaa	every girl is different, but 17 years old is pretty old to have not gotten it. alot of times if a girl is very athletic/skinny, or very obese she doesn't get it until a bit older than normal. i would definitely think by 17 she should probably speak with a doctor, just in case something is wrong.
Amk32sJ0aa	If you gained more weight than is logical, it is probably because your body is in starvation-mode from dieting in between.  You need to get in a  pattern of eating normal-sized meals: at regular times, and to the point where you feel satisfied, not hungry and not stuffed.  This may be difficult at first because of the way you've been treating your body.  You've trained yourself to ignore internal hunger-signals, and now your body is screaming "feed me!" until you give in and binge.  It can become an addictive cycle if it hasn't already for you.      If you find that any aspect of getting back to normal eating is difficult for you mentally or physically, consider seeing a counselor.  If you are in college, counseling is free at your health center, and the staff there work with eating disorders all the time.  A lot of people struggle with this, but you don't have to.  Get some help.      Remember: come easy, go easy.  A little weight gain right now is not permanent.  Once you get back to a truly healthy lifestyle, your body will regulate itself naturally.  Just hang in there.  Good luck.|`|p6I881Lwaa	Wow. I really don't know but, usually, when a person grows between ages of 13-16, he or she experiences more or so rapid growth of intimitate areas (female: thighs, upper arms, breasts, butt; male: chest, upper arms, penis). So many teens find it hard to get rid of the baby fat. But anyways, if you have trouble with eating too much, you should drink two or three of pure water before you eat. This will keep you from overeating. It's okay, you'll get through this.     P.S also, when you eat, try to sit with your back straight, because this kind of helps your stomach feel full much quicker.|`|lK6S5cGSaa	Stop eating.

Kc0SO4Kwaa	How long ago did you have unprotected sex? You could probably be pregnant and it may be inplantation or some people bleed after sex if it was rough. Thats what I've heard. It can't be the soap.|`|ccFeMoFbaa	The body wash shouldn't have anything to do with it, however, I wouldn't use something like that to clean down there. You actually aren't even supposed to use soap, or if you do, a very very mild one. harsh cleansers can irritate your natural pH and even cause yeast infections.
K7x1RHVFaa	Take her to a doctor for a blood work up, a CSCAN, and a general physical to rule out the possibility that her behavior is not mental but physical or biochemical.    If nothing shows up that explains this eratic behavior then get a psychologist to look at the results and begin therapy. I am guessing he will prescribe Xanax or something like that and wait to see what happens.     Good Luck.|`|Aj99vuqYaa	There are different reasons this could have happened. She may be bipolar. She may have been abused in her life and can't get over it. I know those two at least because I have the same problem. It's not constant that I feel/act like that, but it happens more often than it ever should. I doubt that she would ever agree to it, but it's a very wise idea to get her therapy. Not necessarily medication, but that can help, too. Abilify works well. It may sound "crazy" for someone who ain't a kid to see a therapist, but it does wonders for people more times than not.|`|aPBRQky0aa	BIPOLAR IS A STATE OF MIND just like everything else
C2M2StR1aa	After a shoulder surgery I couldn't do a regular push up due to a loss of strength and pain.  I ran across Hindu push ups and after doing them for awhile, I was able to do regular push ups.    I have written a page and posted a video clip on how to do them properly at the following link.     http://www.diet-and-exercise-for-health....     Good health and good luck!|`|8SRjELNBaa	I think their called assisted pushups, it's where you're on your knee's instead of your feet.      Kinda like this guy in the picture, but from that position, make sure your back is flat and do a pushup.. it's less intense.  But also, when you go for walks, walk with 5lb's in your hands to work your arms.|`|Amk32sJ0aa	Talk to a trainer at your gym, they can show you exercises that are right for you.  While your main muscles (biceps, triceps, etc.) may be able to handle your body's weight, smaller muscles such as the rotator cuff can get pulled or strained if you're not used to pushups.  You will want to start with exercises to strengthen these muscles and make sure you're stretching right to stay flexible.      My trainer helped me because the gym equipment kept making my joints crack (weak rotator cuff).  Instead of lifting, I do arm-circles and a whole bunch of reaching arms at shoulder height or above the head with tiny dumbbells.  It's not impressive-looking, but my upper body is so much more toned than before.  And I feel like I can do so much more.  Like pushups.  :)|`|zgfIOZ6raa	everything in moderation. start with even 2 push ups, 5 times a day. nothing big. if you feel that's to little for you, increase the reps. but eventually, when you feel comfortable, keep increasing the reps. you should also do dips, which are like reverse push ups for your triceps. the last thing you want is an unbalanced upper arm :]    if you're feeling really adventurous after that, I've found that planks are very helpful in building back, triceps, and chest muscles.|`|ASSbLOk6aa	Do it at an incline , ,like a road kerb, so that you don't put 100% body mass on your arms. You can also press up against the bed frame or table.

What's the big deal?|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	I used to stand up all the time, but eventually I started sitting down. It's less messy, and easier to get rid of the last drop. I always stand up when I'm at someone else's place, or using a public bathroom. So I guess I do a little bit of both.     Sitting down hasn't made me gay. Not yet anyways.|`|Exv4AjqCaa	its weird unless he's going for  2 also    yuh|`|dBoC8fR2aa	No it not awkward to pee while sitting down especially when you were there trying to doing a big business.

You will notice guys usually stand but the bowl rim is also somewhat tainted.|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	Sometimes when I feel really lazy I'll sit. Or if I'm really really drunk because I don't need to fall over and end up urinating on myself.    Really I don't think it matters.

But each to their own.|`|2dr0hoU0aa	some men sit becuz they have wives or kids(girls) and dont want to be "messy" and like make their love ones sit on pee|`|KCiRI9K7aa	There is nothing wrong with that, the concept that girls pee sitting and guys pee standing is a construct of our society that keeps people in illogical gender roles.   it isn't awkward guys do it all the time when they take a dump.|`|7rD3uJzdaa	Why does that sound awkward to you? I am a guy and i sit down to go pee all the time? Especially first thing in the morning when i am not awake yet? But no i do not do it all the time?

Hope my answer was helpful?|`|Gw1LLzDgaa	No, not at all -- most guys do sometimes, some do usually.    Hermes|`|lW2W1ApBaa	I often times do, it helps to completely empty  myself, and keeps from  spraying all over the place if you get up during the night,I'ts not so uncommon, Most toliet in Japan were designed for sit down use, and most without toliet paper..|`|AA10290500	It's a little strange, but I've heard of other guys doing this.

rm5Nt2VEaa	It depends on the surgery and also your age.  I had retinal detachment repairs and cataract surgeries and general anesthesia was used all seven times.  You are asleep and don't feel or remember anything.      However, they did say most of the time the surgeries I had a local anesthetic could have been used but in younger patients who are more anxious it is safer to put them to sleep.  If you are awake you have to remain completely still however they will numb you locally and you will NOT feel it.     What kind of eye surgery are you having? Good luck!|`|dBoC8fR2aa	I have heard that the optician do his surgery with the patient wide awake, I guess depending on what kind of surgery. Ask him.|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	I had cornea transplants in both eyes (five years apart)  The first one they gave me a local and I fell asleep the second they completely put me under with breathing tube and everything.    ask the doctor on your next visit or just call him.  I don't know what your doctors procedures are of what type of surgery your having so I can only tell you what they did for me.  Good luck  may you have a fast and painless recovery|`|l3Wq57gsaa	nope they have you wide awake and your not allowed to blink for 30 minutes or more. also they dont use anesthetics and pain killers so you will feel every movement|`|PlbtWHvJaa	What kind of surgery?  I had lasik not too long ago and I was wide awake and could see that they were doing something to my eyes... it was a little weird but I didn't feel anything.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	well it depends on what type of eye surgery you are having.   simple lasik corrective surgery then you are fully awake.    for something like glaucoma surgery they would sedate you but not put you fully to sleep.   also for cataract surgeries they usually just give you sedation.     retinal detachment surgery they will put you fully to sleep.  what kind of eye surgery are you having?    what type of anesthesia they use all depends on the patient though.   last time i had a retinal detachment surgery they just sedated me. i wasn't happy.     i've had eye problems my entire life and have had 6 eye surgeries. some with sedation and some i was put fully to sleep.    **edit**  lazy eye doesn't make you go blind so don't worry about that.   i believe for that type of surgery they would either just numb your eye and you would be awake or they would give you sedation but they wouldn't put you fully to sleep.
FhOL7UUZaa	The pill your doctor prescribed you is not very strong compared to many other prescription pills out there. If he is any good at his job, he would have prescribed medication based on your specifics (age, size, severity of pain, etc), which he probably did make the right decision.  So if you are really in pain, you should try just taking half of a pill at first. See how it works for you. Nobody dies from taking half a pill. If there are no bad side effects, you can continue taking them as needed, but never to exceed the recommended dose. You should be just fine.|`|SohrsIBoaa	im on robaxin now for my broken leg. to help loosen the muscles. yes it will make you very dizzy. but thats only if your up walking around or in a car moving. i mean, im bound to a couch, but when i get up, its not like dizzy omg im gonna puke, its like, very calm dizziness. it wont bother you. and leagally they have to put that blah blah blah crap on there.

bQ4RAi07aa	A URI is any type of infection of the head and chest that is caused by a virus. It can affect your nose, throat, sinuses and ears. It could also affect the tube that connects your middle ear and throat, and your windpipe, voice box and airways.  You usually start having URI symptoms one to three days after contact with a cold virus.  You can treat them with non-prescription medicines and other self-care items.  IfAcetaminophen 325 mg (take 2 every 4-6 hours, up to 12 total per 24 hours)   or Ibuprofen 200 mg (take 1 every 4-6 hours, up to 6 total per 24 hours)   or Naproxen Sodium 220 mg (take 1 every 8 hours, up to 3 total per 24 hours)   If your throat is sore,  you may try:  sucking on throat lozenges or popsicles may be helpful.   gargling with salt water (use one teaspoon of salt in a large glass of warm water every four hours.)   If you have a stuffy nose:  Use a decongestant (e.g. Sudafed or Pseudoephedrine)   or, use saline nose drops to relieve nasal dryness   or, ou can buy nose drops or make your own. To make a solution for nose drops, add one teaspoon of salt to a quart of water.   If you have a runny nose, use a mild antihistamine (e.g. Benadryl or Diphenlydramine)  If you have a cough, use a cough medication (e.g. Robitussin or the generic equivalent) or cough drops.

fAcVndo7aa	It is very common for people to have problems with their wisdom teeth.  Many people have them removed for various reasons, and it generally doesn't cause any major problems.  If your wisdom teeth are causing your issues, then I would go along with your doctor's and dentist's recommendations of having them removed.|`|pfm0wcEIaa	If you are have any doubt, it is always best to get a second opinion from another doctor and/or dentist.    It does cause a lot of stress on your body to have a wisdom tooth pulled out and taking all four out is more stress on your body than taking one out.  If you are having problems with one, it does seem reasonable that you have all four taken out at some point to avoid any further problems.  What I think you should discuss and consider is doing it all at once, or in several visits.  You are already suffering from an infection and your body is weak. That is why it you might want to consider taking all four out in more than one visit.    Also, did your doctor do any kind of test to ensure that it was an infection?  She must do that to make sure it is in fact an infection and not something else, such as an autoimmune disease, possibly Sjogren's Syndrome.|`|HAiGuKIeaa	If the doctor is suggesting you to remove the wisdom tooth then its better to go with her suggestion..|`|lAyQqRVjaa	Keep them healthy and you wont have to worry about them being removed.

Before removing any teeth, it is advisable for you to take 2nd opinion as wisdom teeth are vital.
0ff94ba9320182f79127dc5f55cbcaefaa	There is no specific diet for gastroparesis as such. The trick is finding out what you can tolerate and what works for you.  In general terms, GP diets need to be low fat and low fibre. If you include things like bread, pasta or rice, stick to the white varieties. If you eat meat, stick to lean cuts. That's if you're able to tolerate solid food... The other really important thing is to have small, frequent meals - aim for 6-8 a day.    If you're not tolerating any solid food, you can try blending regular meals - personally, the idea of this is pretty revolting to me, but you can make some pretty decent soups. There are also some good nutrition support drinks around - you can get the basic strength ones at the supermarket and the others.|`|u6fXoeNVaa	dont take these sort of pills.

ddd26e577c6620f6c32253e2e6e6a56aaa	Anorexia is a mental health disorder and based on your diet, yes, you are anorexic. You need to convince yourself in the intelligent, rational part of your brain that this diet will make you dead or put you in a coma long before it will make you skinny. Then you need to make the decision to seek help from a parent and a doctor ASAP, just like you are seeking help from us.    After basic treatment, you, your doctors, and a nutritionist can find a healthy way to deal with your physical and mental health. If that means weight loss, it will need to involve healthy eating at sufficient calorie levels as prescribed by a nutritionist. Based on your recent history you probably wont be able to it yourself without falling into old habits. Anorexia is a life long struggle.

22b9f7861c3435566fea96d7ce9f685caa	Um hier mal auf Deine Frage einzugehen: NEIN. Vertraue den "G?ttern in wei?" nicht, wenn Dein Bauch es nicht zul?sst. Du hast immer das Recht auf eine zweite Meinung. Und davon wrde ich, nein habe ich Gebrauch gemacht. Ich habe derma?en viele schlechte, teils sogar falsche Diagnosen gesehen, bei mir selbst in mind. 3 F?llen, im engeren Bekanntenkreis weitere 7, die fast fatal ausgegangen w?ren. Ich k?nnte gar nicht so viel fressen, wie ich manchmal kotzen m?chte. Und das insgesamt 14 dokumentierte F?lle nur in meinem pers?nlichen Umfeld alle Zufall sein sollen, glaub ich nun gar nicht. Also: Internetrecherche galore! Und zweite und dritte Meinung!!!!!! Gerade Knie ist eine der Sachen, mit der eine Freundin von mir nach ihrem Motorradunfall echte Probleme hat.

Oh Mann, sorry fr mein Geslze, aber ich leide schon nur beim Lesen Deiner Frage mit Dir mit...|`|2a0780713ce45d3f354e694113195a4faa	Grunds?tzlich solltest du deinem Arzt vertrauen, wenn du zweifel hast, solltest du nicht nur eine zweite Meinung einholen, sondern komplett den Arzt wechseln. Ich denke nicht, dass man heutzutage allen ?rzten trauen kann, allerdings mu?t du selber herausfinden, welcher Arzt fr dich gut ist. Verschiedene ?rzte sind auch auf verschiedenen Gebieten schlechter oder auch besser.  Gute Besserung!|`|205abd62e46618d0495f9ec4942e3c74aa	2 meinungen bei so etwas schwerwiegendem einzuholen ist fast nie verkehrt, zumal nicht, wenn dein gefhl dich warnt.|`|4a83d46509b07a9bb13c96d5d2ad045faa	Nein, ich glaube nicht. Ich wurde mal von so einem Naturheil-Kasper v?llig unn?tig krank geschrieben und mit einem Fl?schchen Wasser (!!) nach hause geschickt, die er mir als Medizin zum gurgeln unterjubeln wollte. Ein weiterer wollte bei mir eine Wurzelbehandlung vornehmen, was nach Meinung eines weiteren Zahnarztes "Bl?dsinn" und nicht billig gewesen w?r. Bei allem was zumindest teuer oder aufwendig ist, hol ich mir nun lieber eine zweite Meinung ein.|`|618a3c7babeeb8c221fefdd0ee25a6bcaa	Leider nicht immer.    Viele ?rzte sind ein wenig "betriebsblind" und erkennen nur Probleme, die sie selbst behandeln k?nnen - oder wollen nicht zugeben, da? sie keine Ursache bzw. Behandlung wissen. Wir haben bei uns einen Aushilfsarzt (eigentlich schon Rentner!), der z.B. mal eine Patientin krank geschrieben hat (auch mit Knieproblemen) - sie ist dann zu mir gekommen und hat mich gefragt, ob ich den Arzt berreden k?nne, sie zum Facharzt zu berweisen. Er hat sich tierisch aufgeregt, ob ihr die Krankschreibung nicht genge und was sie noch wolle.    Meine Meinung: eine richtige Untersuchung und Behandlung!!!    Deswegen habe ich letztes Jahr mit der Ausbildung zum Osteopathen begonnen. Unser Dozent hat im letzten Kurs ber einen Fall berichtet, wo einem Patienten (auch mit Knieproblemen!) in mehreren Operationen stckweise der Meniskus entfernt wurde - jetzt hat er keinen mehr, die Schmerzen waren aber immer noch da.  Unser Dozent hat nach kurzer Untersuchung festgestellt, da? die Probleme von einem verkrzten Muskel kamen - nachdem er den Muskel gedehnt hatte, waren die Schmerzen weg!    Deswegen wrde ich empfehlen, erst mal zu einem guten Osteopathen zu gehen (wird allerdings nicht von der Krankenkasse bezahlt, und auch hier gibt es Gute und weniger Gute. Bei Interesse einfach melden) - es kann eigentlich nicht schaden, nur nutzen ;)|`|872d7533614f64491b423d8d374440b8aa	hast dir die antwort ja schon gegeben  wenn du nicht sicher bist eine zweite meinung einholen|`|9ce6029ee7fdcaafb2d85ecc292b0f5daa	Eine Zweite Meinung einholen ist sehr zu empfehlen die Krankenkasse kann dich hierzu nochmals beraten.

Dabei musst du selbst abw?gen, ob du noch eine weitere Meinung einholst, die sicherlich nicht schaden kann. Es ist leider heute so, dass manche ?rzte recht schnell mit Ihrer Indikation sind, auch um den Geldbeutel zu fllen, leider fragen nur wenige Leute nochmal nach, was die Aussage des Arztes berhaupt bedeutet.|`|94868a4556e2508e11dc2c3fc2ded1a1aa	Man sollte allen ?rzten vertrauen k?nnen!Aber wenn man das Gefhl hat man brauchte noch eine andere Meinung,dann wrde ich raten dem nach zu gehen.An ambulanten OP``s wird kein Arzt reich auch nicht an Station?ren,er zahlt manchmal noch drauf und wenn es den Leidensweg verkrzt ist es auch ein kleines Risiko wert.Man wird eher von einer Kokosnuss erschlagen als bei so einer OP zu schaden zu kommen rein Statistisch Welt weit!|`|b6ded1093730391e125298aea7b23e52aa	Nein nur Dr Frank,dass ist doch der Arzt dem die Frauen vertrauen.|`|ab3b88b1ca7eb56e6f1907cfab287a99aa	Wo stekkmo Recht hat, hat sie Recht.  *stekkmodaumenhochgeb*|`|6c845970bf2982856c2b2f8f8f0827d1aa	Wenn sich einoch Zeit fr den Patienten nimmt , schon.|`|b3f7e26cade4ad7af7d100f5707748b6aa	Wenn ich all deine Details lese, dr?ngt sich mir de Eindruck auf, dass Du schon l?ngst eine Antwort fr Dich   gefunden hast.    Sicherlich l?sst sich diese, etwas polemische, Frage nicht so einfach beantworten: Es gibt keine Berufsgruppe der man pauschal vertrauen kann - aber grunds?tzlich sollte man in bestimmte Berufe ein Grundvertrauen haben. Was w?re wenn man weder Polizei, Feuerwehr noch ?rzten vertrauen k?nnte? Es ist Dein gutes Recht Dir eine zweite Meinung einzuholen. Bis aus wenige Ausnahmen hast Du ja auch das Recht die Behandlung zu verweigern.    Dabei solltest Du jedoch bedenken, dass die Zusammenh?nge in der Medizin h?ufig relativ komplex sind und man als Laie nicht alles berschauen kann. Natrlich solltest Du halbwegs verstehen warum dieser Eingriff jetzt notwendig ist - wenn Du dem Arzt im Einzelfall nicht vertraust ist es natrlich sinnvoll eine weitere Meinung einzuholen.    Trotzdem finde ich, dass man bestimmten Berufsgruppen, so auch ?rzten, ein gewisses Grundvertrauen entgegen bringen muss. Das eine eventuelle unzureichende Beratung immer gleich auf Profit-Gier zurck zu fhren ist, wage ich zu bezweifeln!|`|1a8f08cedc8ba2e9b55848674c9736ebaa	Meine Mutter Hat das auch, aber hat sich nicht Operieren lassen.

bb475022702b8b2fab4c209fe3889bccaa	A proper diet is the best way to lose weight naturally and keep it off. You have to eat a varied adequate and balanced diet. Your body needs all kinds of food to function properly including fat in smaller quantities though. Your body needs the nutrients and vitamins in fruits and vegetables the most, that is what you should eat the most of (at least 5 servings a day). You also need protein, and a little fat. Reduce your intake of sweets, fried food and foods that contain a lot of fat. Don't drink too many alcoholic beverages or soft drinks (they have a lot of calories). Don't go to sleep right after you eat. And finally exercise at least 3 to 4 days a week for about 45 minutes.Good luck.

It may or may not be due to the circumcision.  It could be that part of the wound never healed properly or was simply too sensitive.  Circumcision in infants removes a lot more than one would think, not only is the foreskin removed, but the natural adhesion between the foreskin and the glans (penis head) is broken so the entire glans is essentially raw.  If this entire area, which is almost like half his penis, isn't healed properly, infection is possible.  Take him to his doctor immediately, if it is an infection, you don't want it to go too far.

Low carb diets will starve the body of it's energy supply and then when you do eat carbs your body will try and save them as fat.    The best thing is to follow a more moderate diet eating lot's of veggies, fruits, meats (if you choose) and whole grains (not breads or cereals). Stay away from processed foods and don't eat within twos hours of bedtime.    Drink plenty of water... about a half ounce per pound you weigh, per day.    Take care. Don't worry about your body too much. If you eat sensibly get exercise and rest you should be fine. Peace.

If it is access skin there really isn't much she can do about it. There will always be a little layer of fat and skin on top of her abs. But she can tighten and flatten it to her advantage. What I do is a great ab workout video. It's called turbo jam. You can order it online. I'm sure there are a lot of really good workout videos out there. She just needs to find one that concentrates on her abs. I have never had anything flatten my belly like this. Also, her diet is also important. She needs to avoid alcohol, salt, and caffeine coz these will cause her to bloat. She also needs to get her 8 to ten 12 oz. glasses of water everyday. Water will prevent the bloating. If she eats a lot of saturated fats it will probably go straight to her belly.|`|AA11601039	Cardio exercises like running.|`|ntPvdl1paa	It's hard to say by just reading your piece over the internet, because her pooch may in fact be excess skin, in which case she's outta luck if she's trying to get rid of that anytime soon. On the other hand, and what seems to be the more likely scenario, she's just got some excess fat in that area, which isn't all that uncommon.  Did she lose weight via diet alone, or exercise?  If she did it by diet alone, then have her start exercising. If she did it via both diet and exercise, then have her change up her exercise routine. Good things to work on would be high intensity short duration strength routines. Also, she should minimize intake of refined sugars as these are readily converted to fat in the body.

fAvLIh7caa	hmm, let me first state this, the first thing always to do is make your client comfortable, so if this is an uncomfortable thing for you, I would make sure I voice that. I ask my clients be be nude, with drape always, if they choose to have clothes on I also tell them this up front, that if they do not feel comfortable than we can work around the clothes, the reason for the nudity is to be able to obtain full strokes on the muscles that are generally inhibited by clothing. To answer your question directly, the difference between the two modalities is the stroke, timing and movement,  I am not sure why no drape,  the strokes require long fluid movement. I have 7 years of experience, teaching and applied, haven't yet found a reason to have my client undraped. For all massage therapists let's hope that this is maybe her misguided opinion as to how she was taught.|`|cb3c52af3e751d31beea15218b9cf940aa	Lomi- Lomi uses big sweeping glides but full nudity is not necessary and usually illegal.

Life Style Change Program for Loosing Weight    By   minootoo     Who needs to loose weight?    Answer is simply not every one, only the over weight person.    Who is over weight?    This is simple, it is easy to find out and it is available on line, it is call Bio Mass Index, and calculations are simple. According to this calculation if you find your self say only 10 pounds more, you may not be over weight. Remember every one is slightly different and you can just watch it, on your own and not let it get out of hand.     What is the reason for being over weight?    This is also simple, have doctor check you out for any physical or hormonal abnormalities. The doctor should be advising you of your ideal weight even though you have already figured out the ideal weight and you are seen a doctor because your weight is not where it should be according to BMI.      Basic understanding of loosing weight.     Every one uses calories at all time. There may be some exceptions to this rule, for most of us; the rate of use, even when we are resting, we use 65 calories per hour minimum. This comes to1560 calories per day. The actual range is between 65 and 100 calories per hour. This is consistent with heart rate of 60 to 80 bits per minute.    Simply put any person eating only say 1500 calories a day will not put on any additional weight. At this level of calories consumption the person should loose some weight over long haul, depending on the individual rate of metabolism.    What is a healthy weight loss?    When one tries to loose weight, one should loose excess fat; there should be a healthy loss of weight. Loosing muscles tissue is unhealthy.    How much is one pound of body fat?    One pound of body fat weight is approximately same as one pound of butter. If you look at a one pound package of butter, you will see it contains between 3200 to 3600 calories. This means that each time a person burns 3600 more calories then what the person takes in, the person will loose one pound.      How many pounds should a person loose in a month?    Any one that is trying to trim down can figure out how long it took to put on the excess pounds. The fact is; it did not happen over night. It usually creeps up, but the person realizes one day suddenly.    This is why a person should not be in a hurry to loose weight. The person should start at once but go slowly. Do not wait for New Year.    Taking above in to consideration a person should not loose more then 2 pounds per month. If a person looses any thing more then that, chances are that the person will not be able to maintain the weight loss. It will take extra efforts to loose and it will take extra efforts to keep it off. Remember slow and steady wins the race.      When an overweight person should start loosing weight?     At once. The person should not be in a hurry to loose weight. The person should start at once but go slowly. Again do not wait for New Year.    How does body react to weight lose?    Any time there is depletion of fat beyond certain level, the body reacts by slowing down metabolism, so that it can build up fat. If the body is use to say 2000 calories per day and detects only 1500 calories per day for considerable length of time it reacts to the situation by reducing the rate of metabolism. When this happens one need to help body by increasing activity. Usually takes about four weeks for body to react.    What is the relationship between body and body fat?    Under ideal condition fat act as a reserved energy source for our body. Certain level of fat is good for healthy living and even may save our life in certain life threatening situations. Every one should have minimum required level of fat on their body.    What if there is no weight loss at 1500 calories in take level?    This is a rear occurrence. Do not panic. The body has slowed down the metabolism to such a great extent that you must help it. The only way to help is to increase activities, this means you have to exercise. You do not need to join Gym but you can go on an an half an hour walk every day or batter still engage in a power walk for same duration. Power walk burns 250 calories per hour and walk burns 100 calories per hour approximately.     What is the importance of body fat for a female?    Females require little more body fat then men. In the absence of certain required level of body fat, females are not able to function properly; in particular they may not be able to conceive. You can find lot more about this on internet.     At 1500 calories intake per day what one must drink and eat?    Drink    One gallon of liquids most of witch should be in the form of wat|`|2Yw0OiTdaa	I lasered my pimples and scars and I went on a diet so i'm slimmer.! email me mana_f15@yahoo.com|`|vFUxOxqDaa	for scars u can use ponds face wash there s separatly face wash for dat n even in garnier its availabl but dont keep on changin coz ur face may bcum rough n u can reduce ur wait at the same time u can keep ur body fit there r many aerobiks classes u can go for that r u can also do yaga which s very gud for health it also helps d body to b fit n early morning u can go for walk r a jog as u can also get fresh air n have control over all fat items lik ghee aloo n so on but never do dieting ok n u can also opt for jim u can follow any of d abov but d main thing u shud hav control over all fat items

vMYZWnQraa	Regaining control        * Prolonged foreplay: Foreplay with a ban on sex can help reduce anxiety and ultimately delay orgasm.      * Distraction: Mild cases of PE can often be solved by learning the art of distraction. This involves turning your mind to something else when you feel you are getting close to climax.      * The stop-start technique: An exercise practised during manual stimulation or sex, which basically involves slowing down or holding off just before ejaculation. This allows the level of arousal to subside, giving more pre-climax control.      * The Masters-Johnson method: A 'penis-grip' technique developed by therapists of the same names. By learning a special finger grip that stops the urge to climax, it's often possible to re-train a man to last much longer. It's possible to master the technique with a willing partner but it's best if you both learn it properly with a trained doctor, psychotherapist or counsellor.     Other ways to delay premature ejaculation:    So, you've talked about the problem and no amount of practise seems to be making any difference. Don't panic - there are still options:        * Sex after ejaculation: Having ejaculated once, either by masturbation or during sex, men generally take longer to achieve arousal and climax again.      * Thicker condoms: Can reduce the intensity of arousal leading up to climax.      * Psychosexual counselling: If PE continues to be a problem, talking things through with a counsellor could help. Find someone suitable through Relate or the British Association for Sex and Relationship Therapy (BASRT).      * Lessen your expectations: Many men buy into the sex myth that they should be in control. This can lead to a great deal of anxiety, which is linked to premature ejaculation. Recognising that both partners play an equal part will take the focus off the need to 'perform' and help you to relax.|`|6f7a5c6b5567693d9a466b3de289a511aa	cocaine|`|f25f5017def12c974b69cfd82ff9531daa	you can only enjoy longer sex if you don't think about you having sex when you are.|`|f0816cb0c52f909c62d70d9a1ddd14fbaa	One hour has been my experience....of course I had to have a firm grip on the situation......|`|d1acb1826887247c40b0cddcef0387e7aa	Masturbate frequently, like 3-4 times a day. You will increase the time it takes to have an orgasm and it will feel pretty good too. Get comfortable with your partner so that there is less performance anxiety. Make her have an orgasm first, before you even penetrate her with your penis you should get her off with oral sex or by fingering her or with frottage, that is rubbing your bits together without penetration.|`|AA11022130	concentrate on her make sure she is repetitively satisfied before you "stick it in" that way you don't need to worry about how long it takes you to get off, make sure you pull out before you shoot.  this way if you want to do it again in a few minutes her couche will be still edible . nobody likes sloppy seconds even if you are the same man who was first. this way you can do it many times in one session. i once did it 9 times in one crazy session and believe me after 2 or 3 times nobody is timing how long it takes you to pop your cork.  after she realizes that your a man that can go 2, 3, or 9 times in a single session she won't be timing you on your first shot either. so here is some personal advice you can take to your grave " the first time you have sex with a woman f**k her brains out then don't worry about it in all future sexcapades" also remember this you are not responsible for her orgasm you just want to make her think you are. happy humping|`|siSp4Lykaa	The thing to do is control yourself before you get to the point of no-return.  So if "10" is "I am about to shoot" don't let yourself get above a 6 or 7 until you are ready to go that far.  Like any other thing, it takes practice... working up to it.  You have to find the balance between staying excited and loosing it too quick.    I can take a long time, or go quickly-- I have really learned to control this.  Sometimes I want it to last, sometimes I am thinking about getting some sleep, so let myself go quick.|`|qxZHXpHXaa	two minutes.

b5050af6348ebc55aabde293d337fc56aa	A doctor would give you a good idea. To GAIN weight? I would say about 3000 calories a day. But don't go shoving junk food in your face,it'll make you feel worse. Add extra servings of carbohydrates and protein, that should bulk you up. Find healthy stuff to snack on. Peanut butter on crackers would fit the bill.

Karate burns a lot of calories at a good workout.|`|EwNNBPw2aa	I would say to eat healthy foods, not junk foods, like pizza, because then you will gain weight in fat, if you want to gain weight in muscle, muscle weighs more than fat, then you can lift weights, and exercise, eat protien shakes, and eat meals.

Second, the advice i give you is that you should eat your past favorite food. I had a friend that was anorexic, and part of her recovery was eating normally. Everyday i would got to visit her and bring a blind fold and three different foods (i made sure she wasnt allergic to any of them). I told her to put it on and then put the foods on the table. then she would smell each food and which ever she got wrong she would have to eat it. She sucked at the game so she usually ate all of them. All i am trying to say is be spontaneous. Take a chance. Dont worry so much about how many calories does it have. Eat pizza, ravioli, anythin that tastes good and will help. you shouldnt be so stressed out. You are 17 for goodness sake. I am 5'5 and 115 pounds. thats caz i eat ice cream and fatty foods (probably gonna get diabetes, lol) any way good luck!!!!!!!

Each drug varies in how it totally leaves the body.  Marijuana takes about 3 months to leave the body.  Also if you are taking a controlled substance, you better have a prescription for it.  Also, most places of employment have a one shot drug test, once you pass, unless you are really out of it, they will check for drugs.  In the military, there is a zero tolerance for drug use.  Prescriptions can not be shared by anyone and that would be a drug offense.  Security administers each test and there are no mistakes.  Also they watch you as you go pee so that you can't place anything in there.  If the individual cannot pee, they are taken to the medical facility and they will take the pee using a catheder.  One time while I was on duty, there was a lockdown and 30 people got caught using drugs on a pee test.  Also the drug tests are completely random.  You can have a drug test 3 times a week to once a month.  The punishment for drug use is 45 days extra duty, 45 days restriction and they dock your pay by 1/2.  after that's over, you are discharged from the service.  My best advice is to seek drug rehab at a medical facility as soon as possible and quit using drugs.  I hope this helps.

The HIV virus needs the human body as its host. The life span of HIV outside of the body has not been determined. However, we know that HIV needs its host cell (a human), the body temperature, and the chemistry of the blood to survive. Out of the body, HIV is out of its environment. As the blood dries, the HIV will die. In areas like a syringe or on a razor in a medicine cabinet, HIV would probably live longer because of less airflow and it's a more moist temperature controlled area.    Just remember, outside of the body HIV can't survive. In minutes it will die and be harmless  If the blood is dry, the virus will be dead. If it is wet, a chance exists that it could still be active. The risk is very small, but rather be safe. Always try and use gloves when you are in a situation where you might be in contact with blood. HIV is very short lived on an inanimate surface. In wet fluid, consider infectious.

The best thing to maximize your height is to get some massage and have them address your Iliopsoas. This is a hip flexor and if it's tight can actually make you appear shorter by not letting you stand up fully.

vpya9hhOaa	I am currently using Nuva ring.  it's great!  it works hormonally, like the pill, but is a plastic ring inserted into the vagina and left in place for 21 days, then removed for 7 and a period occurs.  I really like not having to remember to take a pill everyday and so far no negative side effects.  Mirena was actually my first choice for options but i could not afford it as it was not covered by my health plan :( booo. anyway, nuvaring is a great option so if you're looking for something new, try it.  also try checking out www.plannedparenthood.org , they have TONS of info on every type of contraception.  good luck!    to the girl who answered below me:  My ring has NEVER fallen out during sex, and you can also use tampons while nuvaring is in place (sometimes period does not finish by the time the ring needs to be reinserted), I have and removing tampons does not pull it out either.  If Nuvaring falls out for anyreason, it was probably not inserted high enough into the vagina.  BUT if it does fall out, simply rinse it and reinsert it immeadiately.  no harm done.  good luck! you're gonna love it!|`|2300fab7c8f83c13ff8d54434f362893aa	I would not recommend Depo.

Sometimes so bad i had to hold onto the railing when going down the stairs. Also it made my hair fall out. I would run my fingers through my hair and would get a good sized clump. And it totally killed my sex drive. I was NEVER in the mood. It took my body about a year to get back into a normal routine after I got off of it.

Bx9woPEsaa	When I recently got my Hpv shot the nurse came in and asked were I wanted my hpv shot.  I said the butt because the first time my arm hurt like he.. afterwords.  Five minutes later the nurse returned with the syringe and told me to lay on the exam table.  She then said, "skirt up, panties down" and I slid them down slightlty.  She yanked them all the way down, and injected my butt.  I hardly felt it, which was good, but it was semiembarrasing.  She said that next time I should wear a skirt and thong for minimal embarrasement.  Thats my advice, hope it helps, comment back and say how it went.|`|2300fab7c8f83c13ff8d54434f362893aa	I just got the HPV shot in my arm, and it hurt cause it was directly into the muscle.

QZTsiXAZaa	To gain weight you have to eat more calories than you burn. When adding calories, try to stay away from adding too much fat. While you can get fat from eating carbohydrates or protein, your body likes to use carbohydrates as fuel more than fat. To gain muscle, in addition to eating more you have to stimulate your muscles enough through resistance training that while they recover, they'll get bigger and stronger. To get an efficient workout you might want to join a gym if you aren't already a member.

f5wRhbpuaa	You cant make your body have a shape that it really doesn't have. Your shape is genetic. Sorry, I don't know why you would want that anyway.|`|Wu0XyNspaa	Well, you would need the genetics, as well as a lot of lower body exercises to tone up muscles.  Do exercises such as lunges and squats.  You would also have to tone up your stomach and lose fat around the stomach.    But...it's not all hyped up to be a pear shape.  I have an extreme hourglass shape (similar to pear, but with wide shoulders) and you ALWAYS have a gap in the waistband of your pants, because your butt is larger than your waist, but clothing manufacturers make everything symmetrical, so the waist ends up being bigger than you need.|`|PalExL1yaa	Sorry, you can't give yourself a pear shape - people's genetics do that.     When you gain weight (which you would have to, to get a 'big butt') you gain it everywhere. It is noticeable in some spots at first more than others, but there is no way to gain weight in only one spot without gaining it in other places (like your waist).     People who have a pear shape have naturally fuller hips, and naturally  deposit their fat in their butt and thigh area, and gain it last in their waist area.     Maybe look into the new jeans available that lift your bum, that would probably give you the look you want, without having to change anything.
t2LOcPkLaa	honestly, i wouldn't worry, there is hardly any alcohol in those things. it's nowhere near enough to get you drunk. especially if you only had one and if they were spaced out. but if you start feeling weird or sick, then go to the hospital. i think you'll be fine though.|`|b0z0pbdXaa	relax, you will be fine.|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	no problem|`|Po4Lljjwaa	You're totally fine dude.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Don't worry...it's fine....|`|LB9xWMIWaa	You'll be fine, liver damage only happens when people drink a huge amount of alcohol and take tylenol, that is unless you took a whole bottle of tylenol?

BFXOBS0Daa	I would be very careful about paying so much for any natural breast enhancement solution.     ***With the "Brava" system, the enhancement results are noticeable but not dramatic. So after spending about $1000 dollars and being in pain wearing a clumsy device for ten weeks or so, you could see a minor enlargement but probably not even a whole cup size. The good news is that the growth is permanent and the company is backed by professional doctors and not some crook out to make a quick buck. The system is patented and that is a good sign of its technology being sound and unique.     ***Bloussant claims to be a "natural" product that uses many very common "breast enhancement" herbs that are found in countless other breast enhancement pills on the internet. These herbs include saw palmetto, fennel seed, dong quai, etc. A 2-month supply is $230! 8-months is $690!! A quick search of the web produced hundreds of complaints and dissatisfied customers related to Bloussant. www.infomercialscams.com/scams/bloussant    ***There is also a new herbal solution out there that may have some promise. The herb is called Pueraria Mirifica.  Pueraria Mirifica is an isoflavone-rich vine native to Thailand; grows in only a few areas of northern and western Thailand as well as in Burma. Pueraria Mirifica has been used in Thai traditional medicine for over 700 years where it is referred to as a "Miracle Herb" due to its ability to promote youthful effects in women.      Not only is Pueraria Mirifica traditionally used to fight the signs of aging, it is also known for its amazing ability to enlarge and firm the breasts. Pueraria Mirifica contains Miroestrol; an organic female phytoestrogen that promotes breast enlargement and breast tissue reformation. "Miroestrol has about 3,000 times the estrogenic activity of soy isoflavones." (Professor Sayan Sawatsri M.D.) Its been used for hundreds of years and still very few outside of Asia have ever heard of it.    ***A reputable place to start is http://www.BellasPM.com  This is a new natural herbal breast enlargement and enhancement system made up of breast pills and a breast serum that uses a very powerful grade of Pueraria Mirifica. The system will help you enlarge, lift, and firm your breasts naturally in just a few months. There are great before and after pictures at the site too.    Delivery from http://www.BellasPM.com takes about a week and they will ship to anywhere in the world.

You will feel a tingling sensation which will be the causative spirit. Then think of the saints and their halos. The halo depicts the so-called Holy Spirit which is the ghost you are experiencing. This makes you a saint, and when you realize the cause is a spirit, it will calm down and your symptoms will diminish.

DFJ9m4WKaa	That's fairly common. You're typical male only lasts between 2-5 minutes, on average. What I suggest is one when you start having sex, do it a lot because that will get you used to it. Then the first time you have sex when you enter your girl, don't thrust. Just let your penis get used to the sensation. While doing that take a few minutes to maybe make out with your girl or kiss her body or something before you start really thrusting.    The act of sex is a very complex art form. Just keep in mind great lovers are made, not born. I would highly suggest you find some decent literature (not porn, but self help books on the subject) and read up on various techniques - oral sex, foreplay massaging etc etc.    Do some reading and you can learn how to control your orgasms. Just keep in mind that it really doesn't matter if you last 3 minutes or 30 minutes. Sex does not have to end after you orgasm. If you do before her, just do something with her for a few minutes until you can ummm reload you chamber for a second shot, so to speak. In other words go down on her, cuddle, spoon, make out do all that good stuff until you're ready to have sex again. Do that and really sex lasts as long as you want it to.|`|eRveqo7caa	yeah, considering it takes some girls over an hour...|`|6dHIoJLVaa	It depends on frequency of masturbation, it probably is normal.

But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!

My son had it, and I can say that it is not made up and it is not an excuse by parents or children. Well, some may use this to get out of things, but that does not make it any less real. Having ADHD makes things much more distracting for the person, more noticable, etc. Look up ADHD and candida, ADHD and food sensitivities.|`|8HmULotpaa	Yes, there is a test.  It's a brain scan.  I have had the scan myself a few times.  Once when I was first diagnosed then again every few years after that to monitor any possible improvements.  And once you have the scans it is very obvious if you have ADHD or not.    The problem is most people wont be able to access the test.  I live in a country where medical treatment is funded by the government.  The test takes about an hour all up and you need special equipment to do it.  Again I was lucky as there is a testing centre about 25 minutes from where I live that has the technology.    Most people can't have the test because of the expense and the few people who have the technology.

You can at least be comfortable while waiting, but I don't think they abdomen pain is connected.|`|YPWBwF60aa	hmmm,    If you are feeling pain or discomfort you should definitely seek medical attention immediately.  Pain is never a sign of good things.    In my (vast) experience with UTI's, I have had them travel up into my kidneys, but that sort of pain is usually localized in your upper back on either side.  If you are experiencing localized pain in your abdomen, it may or may not be related to your UTI or you may not even have a UTI.  Burning urination and foul smelling urine could be indicative of another problem.      Please, please, please see a doctor as soon as possible.  If you cannot, please try and get a hold of a local nurse or medical practitioner on the phone to at least speak with someone qualified to properly diagnose you.|`|ZIq2IzOmaa	Call your doctor back in the morning and let the office know that you've got a serious infection and need it taken care of immediately. Your sypmtoms are pretty clear, so some doctors will prescribe antibiotics over the phone if you are comming in within a few days for an appointment.     If your doctor won't do this, head to a health clinic. I'm not sure about your area, but in some pharmacies around here there are actual doctor's clinics where you can get a prescription written.     If that's not an option, and you are really feeling awful then go to the ER. This is the more expensive option, but it's better to get the care you need now than to end up with a kidney infection too.|`|c26378b0778c0dc5452f0b109171dba5aa	go get some cranberry juice, it will flush your system out. I held a heating pad on my stomach to ease the pain, the juice took care of everything else.
r7iZ2JOUaa	Yeah, it sounds like OCD to me. Are you experiencing any other traits? I have OCD and understand what you mean by having something stuck your mind for weeks. It is an utter bummer. For an example, I suffer with re-reading and re-writing which is one of the reasons why I quit school. I'm 16 but trust me, I was actually a good student, did my homework and so on. My mind catches certain phrases I read which must have bothered my unconscious mind and thus I have to obsess over it, even picture the words. A paragraph from my History textbook got stuck in my head for one week. It was suffering.     I suggest that you consult a professional on this issue if it was interfering with your daily life. Or you may email me if you want to talk more about what you are experiencing :)|`|yorfmfiBaa	Have you ever heard the phrase "the crazy never know they're crazy"? Well that's true, so put your tortured mind to rest. As far as your thoughts go, about what is forgotten resurrecting back, it means it never left your short term memory. You found something to preoccupy your mind and, while bored or drifting through a hypnotic state (i.e driving, walking to class, ect), it popped back into your mind. The way you typed out all of this makes me think you are very stressed out. Stress in itself is enough of a chemical imbalance to make you feel you're losing it. It seems you don't allow yourself to relax. If you're always in a fight or flight state of mind, your general well being will be taxed and your mind is running in survival mode, questioning and pondering itself, its actions...never giving you time to reflect.  I suggest seeing a general practitioner at a free clinic who can give you free samples of lexapro for your anxiety.|`|s0HTHGd4aa	Intrusive thoughts was the first thing that came to my mind.  You can google that (IT's) and it should give you a broader range of what IT's can entail.    Everyone has irrational/intrusive thoughts at times.  I think it's only when it really starts to affect your life and how you do things daily, that you should then become concerned.  Is this thought process taking up your whole day--most of it??--majority of it???    I think once you find more info on IT's you will be able to find out where your's fit.  Good luck and if you can get into a doctor, please do.  There is meds for this and it's treatable.|`|ReH5EoR0aa	The last thing you want is a psych cause they have no idea what causes it or how to get rid of it.   Those "disorders" are voted on in a show of hands so they can put it into a book to collect insurance.   If a person complains too much they give him drugs to numb him and shut him up.      Irrational thinking is not being crazy and the world is not a dream.   We are in a universe that is made of material things and sometimes that is crazy, but you are not.   You are a spiritual being.     When a thought goes round and round in your head it is called a "circuit".   It is a thought connected to something that is real but you just can't remember what it is, so it feels crazy.   But it is not.      People who are really aware like you are, know it doesn't make sense and the more you try to figure it out the worse it gets.    Is that correct in your view?    I have had this same thing and fixed it in the past and I have helped other people with this also using Dianetics, which is free to read - just find someone else to do the processes with.|`|AA12270940	I would say based on its severity and how it affects your life it may be a mental disorder like Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or anxiety. My mother is a hypochondriac and believes she is always ill.     Her mental illness that causes this causes her to think about certain diseases she may have constantly. She needs medication to control it and even with meds she has off periods.     So I know from personal experience that it can be rough to deal with and you may not be able to keep yourself from thinking how you do no matter what you say to yourself. You may not have a choice to go see a therapist or doctor if it is serious. I'm sorry that you have to deal with that. Best of luck.|`|nAMG94l9aa	It sort of sounds like you have unresolved issues if u have things turn-up again. Ur definently over analyzling things entirely too much. Stress seems to be right up there too. Get out, take up a an exercise like running or something just as vicorous to let out what fogs your mind. Good Luck.|`|wRtzGgRxaa	I'm not a doctor, so it is not within my scope of practice to diagnose, but this sounds like textbook OCD to me.  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is often times characterized by recurrent, intrusive thoughts (obsession) that often results in anxiety.  The compulsive part is when the victim must perform tasks (locking doors 10 times, making sure the oven is off 5 times) to relieve the anxiety.  I would talk to your family physician and see if they recommend you visit a psychiatrist.|`|yhO62JALaa	You are having a borderline personality disorder moment. Seek the nami website.

364d7a1f957bf7c9aabbc05073bf0f58aa	It means you need to take her to the doctor. Believe it or not, they don't typically consider it 'good parenting' when you try to get medical opinions for your child on a Q&A board online. Do her a favor, and take her to a professional.    Frequent urination can be a number of things, though it is typically related to diabetes, bladder issues, or something wrong with her urethra.    Wetting herself is probably caused by her frequent need to urinate. It may also be a psychological issue.    Now, please; this is a serious issue, so treat it like one.|`|5JLGyaWUaa	She might have a kidney problem where the tubes are small so it does not realease when you want it to take her to a doctor adn ask for a ultra sound on her kidney and tell them to look for her tubes shrinking

But lets be honest they feel like diaper, they leak, and sometimes they stink.  Just start off with a low absorbency one see how u like it if u do move up to the normal absorbency  just make sure to check and change them every couple of hours  And don't believe those old wives tales that tampons will take ur virginity, not even close.|`|2VTFUspFaa	Not really. If ur relaxed and read the directions you'll be fine  but be carefull sometimes some girls have a septate hymen were  getting a tampon out will be a bit hard but getting it in will be easy.  I sugest you experiment down there so you don't have any problems.|`|JEteneuUaa	ill help.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	No, it doesn't hurt. Use a junior sized or a slim sized the first few times and don't start using them until you are on your heaviest day.  They can be uncomfortable (not hurt) if you try to put them in when your vagina is totally dry but the kind with a plastic applicator slide up very easily and are more comfortable.  I suggest trying Tampax Pearl - they have the smoothest applicators.  Once you've pulled the applicator out and the tampon is inside you, tug lightly on the string to put the tampon in place and you'll be fine.  Once  you use a tampon, you won't go back to pads. I promise.  They are much cleaner and more comfortable. You can also swim and work out in them much easier.|`|iTP5CNtuaa	I'm not a guy saying junk. lol. Tampons are usually uncomfortable when you start to use them. After a while however, you become more ok with using them. Give it a few tries and you'll find they are much better than pads. Good luck!|`|r0nI55lHaa	Nope. But start out with the smallest ones, because at first, the bigger, more absorbent ones hurt alot.|`|SslUWT0Jaa	if you put them in right no. heck if your really skilled at it you can put more than one in.  they tend to make you a little sore by like your 6th or 7th day, but to have them in doesn't hurt. its more like a pressure in you, when you first start out and then more you used to it less you notice.  pads suck, there like crappy dipers.  oh and tampons should only be in for 6-8 hours and then you need to replace with new one.  it does hurt though if you put one in, and it doesn't fill up with blood, and it comes out 100% dry.  then it sticking in you like when you use toilet paper and it sticks and won't come off.  luckily there's the easy solution of pooring some water on it well its in you and then pulling it out, or showering/bathing, to do the same effect.
vXbUpjaaaa	never has happened to me...... i would suggest doing something about it though cause you'll just gain all of your weight back.
ntIm2G5xaa	Hi!  I'm so sorry, I know what you mean.  I'm a girl, I'm almost 5'11" and people always feel the need to tell me.  I know I love tall guys, and my friends (even the very short ones) want guys who are your size.  I know sometimes they look very petite, but truly some of the smallest girls are actually the roughest.  So, even though they look breakable they really can handle a lot.  When we go on rides or anything (summer amusement parks) and we all slide into each other I always think how I don't want to hurt them and they're always fine.      One of my guy friends who is your size dated my other friend who is around 5'4" and they were very happy together, but then later on he met someone else closer to his height which he loved as well.  I know quite a few girls who are my height too and we all wish there were more tall guys, you sound perfect!  Maybe look some place new for a girlfriend.  You'd make a perfect boyfriend for a model.    I know what you mean about not wanting to go out.  I wish a lot that I was shorter, but I have other friends who wish to be taller; I'm sure there are tons of guys wishing they were your height.  It's not fun to feel huge, but truly you sound like the best size there is (not huge, no worries : ) ).  I know a guy who's about your same size and the girls love him, I remember talking to him and my other friends saw him and they still talk about him a year later.  Honestly, all the girls I know say they want a guy over 6'.  This comes from the shortest girls I know as well as the tallest.  You will definitely find someone perfect for you!  You sounds like a great guy, any girl would be so lucky to be with you!    Maybe you could start by going to the movies, a coffee shop, or the mall (I have been looking for clothes and met girls taller than me there).  Before you know it you will have so many friends!    Please don't feel badly for being depressed over this.  It makes so much sense!  You are completely normal for feeling this way, and also a completely normal size, even if it doesn't feel like it.  I just have to say again, when I go out anywhere and I see a tall guy I always think it's awesome.    I know it feels really bad when someone says, "You're so tall," but I'm sure they're impressed and lots of them are wishing they were your height.  Plus, I'm sure any girls who say it are wondering how tall you are because they want someone that's an awesome height (aka, yours).  When people are looking at you, they're thinking how great/hott/wonderful/smart/kind/(tons of other amazing things) you are.  However, next time someone says it maybe you could have a plan as to what to say, even just saying, "I know," and then moving on could get it over quickly, or to people who say it a lot maybe you'd like to just explain that you're a perfectly normal height and don't need them pointing out your height to you, I'm sure they'd understand!    Also, apparently, the population is growing taller, so soon there should be more tall girls around.  But there are plenty out already, or, rather, waiting to go out with you.  Plus, there are so many things you can be and do that others can't.  I know I hate when people say that to me, because I'm like, "I don't want to be able to, I want to be shorter," but it's true.  You could play basketball if you have any interest (again people always ask if I play, and that's not fun, so I'm putting it out there in case you have any interest in it).  One thing I think is great about modeling is there are so many tall people, so you could be a  male model and model with gorgeous, tall girls.  I know being tall is tough, but maybe you could find something you like about it, or find someone who's tall that you admire.  In my family there are some very tall guys and they all got married and are very successful and loved people.  I'm sure you are so loved, and I really love your height, it's fantastic, and a ton of people agree with me I'm sure!    If you want to talk or anything I'm here.  You're a great person, height and all!  I hope you feel better about this soon, you deserve too!    Sorry this is so long!|`|4T9fZzITaa	girls like tall guys. guys want to be taller. you seem to have a good build if you weigh that much with your height. you are not taller than everybody but like 75percent maybe which shouldnt matter.. everybodys taller than me!! but you need to accept that & embrace it. what good is it guna do to look at our flaws? and really a lot of ppl nowadays are not who they perceive to be.. fake. it's hard to come upon real friends which is much more important than fakes..  if you hate your body go to the gym.. alotta girls do like tall guys with good bodies. my best friend is 6'2 and he went out with a girl who is like 4'11 .. don't think about size think about what really matters which is not phsyical appearance. just accept yourself and the sooner you do the sooner you'll be on the road to happiness.|`|J6e9WPKFaa	Dude, That is not so bad I know a lot of people who are 6'1 my brother is 6'2 he gets a bunch of girls you just have to stop being so depressed and go out there and find a girl you should take "you are so tall" as a compliment I wish I was taller because girls like it when you are taller then them so you should be happy about that! I know this one girl she is really really hot, but she is taller then me so she doesn't like me! Just et out there and find you a girl!|`|xrf7ScCTaa	I think its great that you're tall! My brother is 6' and everyone comments on how great he looks. I'm 5'3" and my boyfriend (well, sort of) is 6' too. And have you watched wrestling? Everyone there is more than 6 feet tall. So its okay to be tall. People WANT to be tall.|`|AA11622346	A. I don't have any friend either-   B. I'm the same Height     so there must be a connection- tall people suck at life. (apprently)    I love tall boys I had a german friend that was 6' 8 mmmmmmm|`|2ax2pOmjaa	i think you should be proud because there are many short guys that wish to be tall|`|6nDqvtwbaa	Don't feel depressed man.  How old are you??    6'1 is not that tall unless your 14.    Anyways, it's much worse for the girls that are really tall in the world.  There are plenty of pretty girls in the world that are just really tall and it seems like they would have it much worse off than you.    Girls like tall guys MORE  generally.    Just ask the question.    I'm only 5'8" and won't grow any more!!  Can I have an inch or two??    hehe    Don't sweat it.|`|zWBYxMvWaa	How old are you?      I know tons of tall guys at my school and people admire them.     6'1 isn't that tall! I know some boys that are 6'3 or 6'4 and they embrace their height! Be happy for what you have! If I complained about all my faults then I would be miserable!     If someone comments on it then just say yea and blow it off.       You don't have to have a girl that is just as tall as you! My parents have a foot and a half difference. At least you are the guy so its okay to be tall! Imagine some of the really tall girls out there!          Embrace your assets! (yes that is an asset). Look for a girl around 5'8 or so if you want!

SohrsIBoaa	the shot itself wont hurt. its a tiny needle. its all in your head, people get so worked up over the fact someone is sticking something sharp into your arm. its not bad at all. but like, a tetanus shot, the needle itself doesn't hurt, but the day after, the medicine the y inject into you makes the penetration site very sore. so, it might be painful in your arm the next day. nothing motrin or advil wont take care of though.|`|R1LvhhTeaa	Well sure - shots hurt. You got a hunk of steel shoved into your arm.  But it's quickly over anyway - and it's always better than dying of some horrible disease you're being inoculated against.|`|dc68cd8917ad70803439a0c012bb4db0aa	it's mostly psychological  it feels like a pinch, and your arm kinda feels sore after, but nothing like terrifying  most people are just afraid of it in the first place  if you dont like watching needles go through skin i dont recommend watching  if you even had to ask this question, i doubt you'll be afraid at all|`|XG8jzUWlaa	A little bit of both. Shots do have a "little pinch", but often people get so worked up about them that their nerves make it seem worse.    You will be fine! :)|`|bQ4RAi07aa	It depends on who is giving you the shots I find that the more experienced the person is in the medical field the less I feel the pain.  Also a phlebotomist is actually the person whom I dearly trust to draw blood, give shots, etc.  They are specialized in this field.  So, hopefully you'll get someone that can skillfully give pain-free shots or if not, point your toes together and bend your knees before the stick and you should not feel the pain.  Hope this helps.
FBQeBwrdaa	Yup, I just tried one rep of all the above and I can say that it definitely will be effective.    You should eat lean meat on occasion, though. Man is not an ungulate.
33e9dcdd714c2c738473e38d4057cc8eaa	Ooh I feel your pain. It'll go away soon enough. I took tons of painkillers and gargled with really warm water (with a little salt dissolved in it) every time it hurt. It made my teeth feel a little less sore.  If you try it, I hope it helps:)|`|DzHB8z6Yaa	Act fast. The constant adjustments involved when you have braces cause inevitable pain. However, if you treat the pain early, you are much more likely to make the experience more tolerable.     Step 2: Take pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relief drugs such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help treat the deep mouth pain associated with new braces and constant adjustment. This pain originates from the pressure of shifting teeth and extends into the gums and jaws.     Step 3: Use wax. Orthodontists generally offer an unlimited supply of wax to patients. The friction associated with wires and metal fittings in the mouth tend to cause sores and cut the insides of cheeks and lips. By placing a ball of wax over the metal of the braces, especially at night, patients can avoid further irritation.     Step 4: Invest in an oral anesthetic. Over-the-counter anesthetics like Anbesol and Orajel temporarily deaden the mouth. Dab a small amount of the anesthetic on a cotton swab and apply it to sores in the mouth. The gel will deaden the spot and completely take away the pain for a limited amount of time. This method is particularly effective when trying to fall asleep at night. The gel wears off by morning, but allows a pathway to sleep.     Step 5:Try toothpaste for sensitive teeth. If you have a naturally sensitive mouth, a toothpaste for sensitive teeth can lessen mouth sensitivity over time and treat pain on a long term basis. By lessening the sensitivity of the mouth the adjustment of braces hurts less.     Step 6: Give it time. A tolerance to the pain associated with braces takes time. The longer you have braces the less you will experience the sores, cuts and deep pain that are common in the early stages.|`|xWXv7bpxaa	That is very normal. I remember when I had braces...would not hurt after they tightened them or put a new thing on them it but boy did it hurt the next day! Just hang in there after a day or two it'll be normal!|`|sZFA4XXZaa	From memory, it took me 3 days for the pain to stop and mind you, it did not start until the next day.    It also depends on who you are as an individual... how tolerant to pain you are. The braces are just doing their job and you will eventually get used to it.    Hope I helped.|`|52cx6Rxbaa	I drank a lot illegally|`|JrijzHGsaa	I just got my braces off...the first week I got them they killed. I put a lot of wax over them and tht helped a lot.  Take 2-3 advil for 3 days...after the 3days you shouldnt have any more pain. It's like working out for the first time in a while and feeling sore.  The pain will eventually go away
41uwt6Y5aa	A UTI is when bacteria makes it up your urethra and causes an infection.  It is also known as the "honeymooners disease" due to it being connected (mostly for women) to vaginal intercourse.  A way to help prevent it is to try to pee around 15 mins after sex, or as soon as you can.  Your sterile urine will most likely get all of those nasty germs out of there.  A UTI is connected with a burning sensation when you have sex, but also when you urinate.  You mentioned that it hurts only during sex. Does it hurt when you urinate as well?  If it hurts both times, I would highly suggest you see a doctor.    Another thing this could possibly be would be chaffing.  Since you are using a condom, perhaps you aren't lubricated enough for the latex and since it dry rubs, it chaffs.  A way to fix this would be to use lubricant like KY Jelly.  Stick to water based or what ever the condom recommends. You may also be allergic to the latex itself.    If all else fails, see a doctor. Better safe than sorry!|`|wRtzGgRxaa	The most common cause of UTI's is E. coli (fecal contamination).  Women are much more prone to UTI's than men because of the shorter urethra and the closer proximity to the anus.  Make sure to urinate before and after sex and to clean your urinary meatus after intercourse.|`|TRrTunqvaa	it can be from sex if bacteria get shoved up you uretha or whatebver its called. you should always pee before and after sex to help avoid it. i dont know if this helps, but i got 2 of mine after having anal. i guess we didnt wipe him off good enough and bacteria got in there when we switchd back. so just clean it after sex and pee!
T9l6QWlcaa	Any athletic store and even Walmart carries hand and wrist exercisers that you hold and squeeze to help strengthen wrists.  Tennis balls will work too.  squeeze them intermittently several times for 10 to 15 minutes 2-3 times daily.  You should start feeling difference in a week, then can taper down to few times weekly.  I use grips with finger cut outs I got at Walmart because of my weak wrists.|`|UmdPAqataa	A simple exercise that you can do is resisted wrist flexion or extension.  You can use your other hand to push up or down on your weak wrist.  Try to hold the contraction for 30 seconds in each direction and repeat it 3 times.  This is called an isometric exercise and is the most basic type of exercise you can do, as well as the first line of strengthening after an injury.  When you are comfortable with this, you can lift water bottles or soup cans, depending on your strength.    Hope this helps!|`|ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	Stretching is pretty much as or more important than strengthening.  The link shows a good routine for both.
mFhMX9qRaa	yeah .. i read in cosmo that during sex when you are getting 'turned on or whatever' that if you use the muscles that you use to hold your pee in it intensifies .. whatever haha.  so yeah i guess that could happen like that|`|T1CuRwm3aa	it is normal and occurs because your bladder presses and, well, you know the rest|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	do you mean when you finally go pee, it feels so good it's like orgasmic?

For example one can't hear the old TV or CRT whistle after a certain point.

Tests lie...rashes and swollen throats dont!|`|rJRyVZhvaa	It depends on what food (test) your blood was tested for.  You may have an allergy to sugar, wheat, gluten, or whatever, and it may not show up in a blood test, but if you take a scratch test for a food, it could show up.  Some foods may cause you to rash and itch by just touching it (like shellfish), and some foods may cause anaphalactic shock and seizing from eating it. Also, it may take time for an allergic food to make symptoms appear (like wheat, which causes arthritis).   You may need/want to take a battery of tests for different suspect foods. Check around on the web for a list of these possible foods, and even check on alternative medicine for allergies.  All the best to you!|`|tJuEjOzGaa	i have a severe allergic reaction 2 nuts. my positive test was from a skin test not blood. ask to be refer ed 2 an allergy specialist at your local hospital

I never thought that would be possible but with the right care and therapy, it can happen for you too.  The hardest part is admitting there is something wrong that you can't fix yourself.|`|QHqPoAVSaa	We as humans are very vulnerable and fragile.  We all feel pain and sadness.  We all feel alone and overwhelmed at times, sometimes a lot.  Does everyone feel sad at times, yes.  You stated that you only feel this way when you are not doing things.  You need to keep yourself busy but not ignore the underlying issues.  You need to find something that is fulfilling to you and participate in this when you are alone.  It will keep your mind busy and could possibly help you.      How about an example!  I hate writing but when I am alone, or sad, or have nothing to do I can't get enough of writing.  I take everything that inside me and get it out on paper.  Occasionally I write something extremely positive like "I Love Myself" so when I am reflecting or reading some of my past thoughts I can at least find something that amongst all the sad stuff will perk me up.    Do you have a talent or a skill?  Do you like to do word fill ins or read books?   Just find something that's just for you and have fun with it!  If all fails you can email me and I will try to cheer you up!  :)|`|9Hp6ErIGaa	dont worry, I feel the EXACT same as you but mine is a tiny bit more worse, I feel like an empty shell, like I have no soul or life.  most of my days I spend at home sitting on my laptop because I have no clue how to get over this feeling, I dont feel like doing anything!    sure i have friends at school but they are just other people that I probably wont know in the next few years so I dont really pay close attention to them.

gkSy0Duwaa	She might be shy or just doesn't know you well enough. Definately be yourself, even if you change and she likes you it probably won't last if you have changed yourself to pretend to be someone you aren't..    My advice is to hang out with her more and smile/tell jokes a lot, get to know her better. She will get to know you better at the same time. Movies are good, either at the theatre or just at someone's house.    Also if you make a move on her don't do it with other people watching.. at least not until later in a relationship when you know she will be ok with it. Sit a row back or something. Like if you are asking her out for the first time it's better not to ask her in front of other people.. not just because she will feel pressured but also because if she says yes you might not know if she really meant it or if she was just trying to not look like a jerk.    Move at your own pace and get to know her, things will work out.|`|DwI2MV53aa	I'm sorry dude, but it sounds like this girl wants you to be a badas* and (this isn't bad) you just sound like a nice guy who isn't mean.

bQ4RAi07aa	if a your symptoms fail to improve after the first course of antibiotics, a urine culture is imperative in order to document the presence of infection and to determine which bacteria are causing the infection so that appropriate antibiotics can be administered.   Recurrent urinary tract infection   At times, you may respond appropriately to antibiotics but develop another urinary tract infection within a short period of time. Urinary tract infections, which recur over time, are called recurrent urinary tract infections and require further evaluation.   Evaluation for recurrent urinary tract infections may include:   Repeated urine culture   X-ray study of the urinary system (ultrasound / IVP / CT scan)   Measurement of residual urine in the bladder after voiding   Cystoscopy   The goal of the evaluation for recurrent urinary tract infections is determine if there is an underlying cause for the repeated infection. Abnormalities in bladder or kidney anatomy, incomplete bladder emptying, kidney stones, etc. may all predispose to recurrent infections. Any abnormalities which are detected can then be treated in order to eliminate the source of infections.
LCAzlHhEaa	You can't lose 10 pounds in 2 weeks unless you starve yourself.  The healthy way to lose weight is 1-2 pounds a week.  With diet and exercise; I do at least a mile daily on my elliptical machine, and then while I am watching TV at night I do crunches during the commercials so I don't really know how many I do.    Also do you know that there are 3500 calories in one pound.  So to lose just one pound you have to burn 3500 calories more than you consume to lose one pound.  I don't think that is possible at least not in one day to lose a pound.  That is why it generally takes a week to lose only 1-2 pounds.    And yes I have tried Acai Berry & I am losing weight but I don't know if it's because of the berry or because I am working out.  If you decide to try acai berry get it from somewhere like GNC or Amazon.com because all the free trials that are out there want you to pay like 5.95 for shipping for the first supply and then they will automatically send you more next month and bill you like 80 and I got mine at Amazon for like $7 a way better deal.|`|yn0FXozCaa	go to lifewithhealthandwealth.isagenix.com and isamovie.com watch that video then email me at kierra.poulos@gmail.com this stuff is all natural and helps you loose weight.|`|9XmJPjXvaa	if you can run at home then run.  however if you can't, you should start making adjustments to your diet.  get the right diet.  if you need to lose  pounds fast then it has to be your diet + exercise
pqnEavSyaa	It's possible that you may be suffering from shin splints, a painful condition in the shin involving inflammation that occurs either in the front or inside section of the shin bone. In many cases, shin splints can result from intense physical activity such as running or jumping, and is a condition that can often take a long time to heal.     The symptoms for shin splints include tightness and/or tenderness around the shin, especially after running or walking for long distances. Shin splints are generally caused by excessive stretching of muscles and tendons along the shin bones (tibia and fibula). Overuse of these muscles by athletes and runners is the most common factor.  Excessive pronation of the feet can also be a major contributing factor. Over-pronation leads to internal tibial rotation and increases the tractional forces upon the muscles and ligaments in the lower leg.    In the short term, rest is required to help alleviate shin pain; running and other strenuous activities should be avoided until the condition is minimized. Shin Splints can frequently be prevented by warming up before intense physical activity.    Using appropriate footwear is also a good way to prevent and reduce the effect of shin splints, especially for runners who strike heavily with the heel. Running shoes with proper rear foot stability are important. Orthotic insoles are useful in that they help prevent over-pronation and provide heel cushioning to reduce impact while providing heel stability.    Please refer to link below for more information.|`|izX7ymibaa	You're having shin splints, which are caused by straining the short muscles in your shin. Heating pads, hot baths, and massage should help.|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	You have shin splints :)  Look it up on webMD or something.  My mom used to be a nurse and I used to play a lot of sports too.  When I'd get these, I'd have to take ibuprofen to get the swelling down, then wrap them in ice for a little bit, then just wrap them tight like I was tying down the shin to the bone when it hurts bad until it goes away (a few hours tops).  What happens is your tendons have gotten a little torn and swollen and pulled away from the top of your lower leg bone near your knee a little.  Good luck!  Take it easy and remember to stretch, that helps!

DFJ9m4WKaa	I like it! I mean it kinda sucks when a girl is too tight but still its all good. And I'm a shameless bastard I don't care if I get hard in public. If I could walk around with a picture frame I'd do it! I would be embarrassed if I had a ***** around my grandma though....    Pros - a man with a large penis is a turn on to many girls. A well endowed man doesn't have to "worry" if he's big enough for her, which is a big boost for his confidence.... unless she is a size queen with a nine inch minimum prerequisite. Other than that the only real advantage is just bragging rights.    Cons - .... well there isn't any really. I mean I suppose if we ran around naked it'd get caught on more stuff. And some men with big shlongs can have equally big egos and act really cocky. And some men do assume that size is everything and don't take the time to learn about oral sex and other forms of pleasure.    oh my size? 8 1/2" long and 5 1/2 around hard and it varies when its soft.|`|mxu1mzgqaa	actually, if it is too long, it can hurt the girl. they don't really like it too long, they prefer it close to the average size so they can get the most out of it. as for me, i don't measure myself. i don't feel the need to do so. i am fine with what i have. if someone is really that superficial as to go off of size, then i have no need to be with them. i would guess that i am about average though.|`|NwGDlZl1aa	WHAT???????????

yE2vM76naa	Well, I did some research for ya on the matter - here is what I turned up - -     Infacol is made by Forest Laboratories Ltd, and is made up of the following ingredients;  Simethicone 40mg/ml.  It also contains;  Saccharin Sodium  Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose  Orange flavour  Methyl Paraben  Propyl Paraben  Purified Water.    And as far as I could find, its not here in the states....  but  basically, its mylanta for Babies (more properly, they call it mylicon)   http://www.mylicon.com/products/index.jh...    which, if you ask me, looks better because it doesnt have the saccherin, or artificial flavors.     But, that said, its a medication. Safer than many for sure...though you could try a little diluted (with water) flat ginger ale or a mixture of diluted ginger and fennel tea mixed with a little juice for sweetness.  Fennel seed tea is also excellent     Hope your darling is feeling better soon.  Good Luck

Read more about it here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambien|`|Wb6yzXA0aa	Sorry, but no.  The active chemical in Ambien is Zolpidem.  THC, or, Tetrahydrocannabinol is the active chemical in cannabis (marijuana).    THC is considered a schedule II drug under the Controlled Substances Act, and as such it won't be found in any form that is prescribable.  Yes medical marijuana is allowed by some states, however, federal law has not been changed to approve its use.    Ambien is a prescription medication manufactured by Sanofi-Aventis, mainly to be a "non-addictive" type of sleep aid.

There are a lot more symptoms (headaches are one-sided, recur at the same times each day, are sometimes accompanied by a runny nose or tearing of the eye, etc.) so I would hardly feel confident saying that you've got these, but a cursory look suggests that it might be so. If it seems that this is what you have, you should know that oxygen can help a LOT and pretty much immediately.

WJjfrf0Caa	No is the short answer. One of the bad things about the internet, is that bad information is able to be spread and sometimes it is hard for people to differentiate between truth and lies.    The problem lies in the difference between causation and correlation.  This line has been blurred and now many people are confused. Just because 2 things happen around the same time, doesn't mean that one causes the other. The fact is that the symptoms of autism sometimes present within days of children getting the vaccine. But that doesn't truly mean that the vaccine causes the autism. Another fact is that there are children with Autism that did not get the MMR vaccine. Another fact is that the Thimerosal has not been used in American made vaccines since 2001. But even so, the number of autism cases seems to be on the rise.    The real danger is that people will believe that the MMR vaccine actually causes autism, and then people will not let their children be vaccinated. If many children are not vaccinated then they are at risk for getting measles, mumps, and rubella. These diseases, if contracted by many people, can be devastating to a country. These diseases can cause blindness, deafness, and mental retardation. very scary stuff.    I know that the idea of giving your child autism from a shot is a scary idea, but there is not evidence to support it. even though many people have tried to prove a link.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	I am afraid it is well past time to put this unfortunately medically created myth to rest. There is no real evidence for this and there never really has been.     It has however done irreparable harm to the UK immunisation program, resulting in measles epidemics. It must be borne in mind that measles is potentially fatal!    http://www.nhs.uk/news/2007/January08/Pa...|`|ElBIeRFNaa	i asked my daughter's pediatrician about this, because I was really scared about it, and he said that there is no proof vaccines can cause autism.|`|5LR1RZelaa	Unlikely.    http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/vaccine...|`|x3EPqezJaa	It doesn't. They've done extensive testing, having removed the allegedly autism-causing stuff (thimerosal) from vaccines. But there was no change in the autism rate. The data's just not there to support that contention.|`|fAcVndo7aa	Some studies completed several years ago suggested a link between vaccinations and autism.  However, those studies have not been confirmed at all; in fact, several of them have retracted their findings.  You can find an interesting table with some info at:    http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/documen...|`|lXaAFIHfaa	I believe it is environmental. Pesticides etc.. Perhaps even the Hormones, antibiotics and chlorine used in our foods.|`|YfIm4IqSaa	Most likely not as what scientists have begun to speculate.    I find it odd that the autism rate is constantly on the rise now. They are supposedly coming up with better ways to detect it at much younger ages? How on earth do they detect autism in an infant? I think that to a certain extent psuedoscience can cause autism. Being treated very differently at a young age may cause more "Rain Man" types of people to be born, as well as the much worse types.|`|r6OQkyIGaa	There is no scientific evidence of a connection between combined vaccination and autism.|`|a9e5IZOWaa	i would seriously doubt it.  i think what has happened is that there is a higher rate of diagnosis of autism and other autistic spectrum disorders made by the medical/educational establishments.    this in itself is highly curious as doctors still do not fully understand autism nor its causes.

Fm1ttoHPaa	I'm not an expert but i know there is a muscle in that area, I would'nt be surprised if its just a simple cramp in that particular muscle, if it feels a little tender to the touch, it is definitely a cramp, if not, it could still be a cramp but It might be something else, I would be safe and go to a doctor though just in case... Unless your having insurance problems which is happening to ALOT of people these days including me.|`|IzHfbWtiaa	X-rays and even ECG's can sometimes be difficult to pin point a problem!

We each have what is called a Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). This rate gradually decreases with age.  To the BMR you add the total calories used during the day due to all exercise and activity, which gives you your Active Metabolic Rate.     I am 6', 170 lbs and 52 years old. My basal metabolic rate is about 1700 calories burned per day. To that number I can add whatever calories I burn during the day due to activity and exercise. That will tell me approximately how many total calories I will burn up in a day.     Once you know this number you can eat however many calories you choose in order to lose, gain or maintain your weight.   You burn about 3500 more calories than you consume to lose a pound.     I have a page posted at my website that explains this further.  You can also input your own info to see your own numbers as far as calories used in a day.     www.diet-and-exercise-for-health.com/b...     Good health and good luck!|`|sv4guUQNaa	go to dailyplate.com  On there you enter your age, activity level, weight, etc and they give a a daily calorie guideline.

Gw1LLzDgaa	I truly believe that the God you believe in is NOT real.    Deity, by whatever name, does not care that you sh*t, p*ss or masturbate and c*m.  Deity, by whatever name, created you as you are -- and made you wonderful, as you are.    You don't have to become an atheist unless you want to (I'm certainly not one) -- but may I suggest dropping the incredibly suffocating teachings that you have received.  They are worthless teachings, and if you believe them, they will hurt you.    Kind thoughts,    Hermes|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	Jesus pooped also.|`|r1fVrEwcaa	yeah you don't take religion seriously enough u mide as well become atheist|`|NwGDlZl1aa	well i thick it would be good to become a  Nihilist   (a belief in the pointless of existance.  the absence of any reason).|`|BiwhHuTeaa	no not at all but just chill try not to think about it just live your day and dont let that bother you God is more looking out for us than watching our every move but you should not become a atheist dont u wana go to heaven?|`|dnEmFs2maa	You are a sinner, and God is a pervert.  He records your private activities and plays them for his friends.    That's a joke, but that reflects my views on the nature of this particular question.  However in all seriousness, I wouldn't say Atheism is the answer, as you should have something to believe in.  You should find what you, yourself, believe in.  Don't blindly follow what you are taught to believe in.  Follow your own path.
ovi4hOpiaa	well tell your parents it bothers you and try to reason with them.

But i wont get into what i did.:P|`|ihOIHE5Aaa	Grounded for a year? For a bad report card? Your parents really don't know what they're doing. It's not the grounding that's hurting you, but the overreaction towards something that they should be trying to help you with. Do your best to bring your grades up and then have a talk with your parents about regaining your "privileges."|`|iTP5CNtuaa	I wouldn't be concerned with the effects on your mental health in the long run. Though grounding is a good punishment for whatever it was you did, a very long time will just leave you comfortable in that state and will overall prove to be just a time-waster.   Being grounded for such an extended period of time can really make you feel isolated and leave you unable to connect with your friends when it comes to them talking about what they did over the weekend or summer or whatever. However, there is no reason to believe that being grounded all that time was the cause for bad grades. Don't  worry about permanent damage.   If I turn out to be wrong in 30 years when a possible future shrink tells you that grounding messed you up a bit, then let me know. Sorry about such a harsh punishment.   I got the same thing when I was a freshman in high school. About your age...
hiToH4kCaa	No you cannot get acne by sitting next to her. Acne cannot travel through the air or anything like that. It's not a contagious disease. Her face may be hard to look at but the way she looks has nothing to do with what she's like.     My point is, regardless of what you think of her you should be nice to her. No you will not get acne from sitting next to her. No one said you had to talk to her or even look at her, just keep your comments to yourself. Don't ignore her either because her acne will go away and things change. Frankly I don't think this is a big deal. Either put up and be quiet or move to another spot. No big deal. Just don't make a rude comment like, "Ugh I can't sit next to you" because then you would be in the wrong.|`|xIF2lShpaa	What goes around, comes around.

Looks matter but not every detail. Don't be so judgmental, she might actually be a great person if someone would have the heart to talk to her and be kind to her.

2T6R9DPkaa	Elliptical machines are good because they have less impact on the joints. Many of them also come programmed with weight loss programs in which the amount of tension increases and decreases as you run. The ones I have used just ask the type of program you want and how much you weigh and you get started on a 20 minute workout, Hope this helps.|`|LCAzlHhEaa	I prefer elliptical, you are using so many muscles while doing this.  Ellipticals are low impact so you feel like you are running in air.  In addition to losing weight, getting in better shape, my calves, thighs, butt, abs, arms, and back all look much much better from using an elliptical daily.  I will never use a treadmill again.
VSCYTZ38aa	You could try some over the counter canker sore stuff (I think it's called Canka). Or you could put a little Alum on it (it's in the spice section at the store). It hurts like bloody hell but it dries the sore out and makes it go away faster. Oh, and it taste's awful too. But it really does work fast.|`|AA11080641	Oh boy, finally a topic I'm an expert on.    A canker sore is an ulcer inside your mouth. Think of it like a little wound. The cause of canker sores (unlike cold sores) is unknown - it's been correlated to several other problems as well as an absence of any other issues. In general, it's related to acid - many people find they get them after drinking a lot of something very acidic, like Mountain Dew. Others with irritable bowel syndrome find that they get canker sores around the same time their IBS flares up.    Anyway, there's no cure for a canker sore, but there's stuff you can do to help alleviate the pain. I go with two things:  - Baking soda. Rinse your mouth with a baking soda mix frequently - it'll sting while you do it, but the saltiness of the baking soda will make the sore start closing and temporarily numb the pain, while the mouthwash-ish properties will help disinfect it to kill any bacteria that might be in it. Baking soda can reduce the time it takes to recover from a canker sore, though it's hard to predict.  -Orajel Mouth Sore medicine. Orajel makes a mouth sore medication that you apply directly to the sore - it contains a numbing agent, but also forms a seal over the sore - oftentimes what makes a sore most persistent is that it gets continuously reopened and irritated by your teeth, so the protective coating prevents that. The coating is really impressive - it stays very dry in your mouth, completely removes the pain, and is strong enough that you can eat while having it applied. The problem with it, though, is that applying it means touching the sore, which often re-opens it - and once the seal is formed, the sore doesn't get any air, meaning it takes it longer to heal. So the Orajel medicine makes them much easier to live with, but also makes it take longer for it to heal. It's up to you whether it's worth it - for me, it is, although if you have a significant other, good luck getting them to kiss you with your mouth tasting to them like antiseptic!    As far as prevention goes, one thing stands above all else: switch to a non-SLS toothpaste. Sodium lauryl sulfate is the agent that makes toothpaste foam up when you use it, and it's been strongly correlated with canker sore formation. One study showed that 80% of individuals suffering from canker sores who switched to a non-SLS toothpaste noticed a significant improvement. I, honestly, was skeptical, but finally I tried one and I've only had a couple sores since - and the ones I've had have been much, much less painful. I used to get them all the time, and often times several at once - it was horribly painful, but switching toothpaste has helped incredibly.    Non-SLS toothpastes are hard to find - check Sensodyne's first, they make the only non-SLS toothpaste I've ever found on store shelves. Make sure to look at the ingredients, though, because some of theirs do have SLS - only a couple of them don't.|`|OhyEivqbaa	If your dental office offers laser treatment you can have the canker sore lasered. I'll kill the virus and make it heal much faster. Or you could go to the store and pick of some over the counter products such as Oragel to relieve the pain temporarily. I've also heard that putting a drop of hydrogen peroxide onto the sore helps it heal a bit too. Other than that you kind of have to let them run their course. I've had them too and they're SO painful sometimes. I would stay away from anything too salty or sour. Maybe stay away from hard/sharp foods that could poke into it.    Hopefully that will help you out a bit!|`|UUx74K5Caa	I think "Oral-B" works for canker sores.  While you're at the drug store, ask the pharmacist because I think there are different formulas.  Avoid orange juice and anything acidic.

Can be very painful, sometimes they start out of nowhere. Cranberry juice, water and over the counter meds can usually help if you catch it early enough.

45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	My understanding is fart gasses are produced as the byproduct of bacteria acting on undigested food that has entered your intestines.  I believe it typically takes 4-6 hours for food to pass through the stomach of a healthy individual into the intestines.  Therefore any farts you produce before that time are probably not a result of that particular meal itself.  I side with your friend.  If you swallowed air during your meal you could begin farting within minutes however so I don't deny your account.

DFJ9m4WKaa	I'm 5' 7" and I'm at the low end of my BMI at 125 lbs. Your BMI is really just a guide line to help you gage your physical health based on your weight. If you really want to tell how "healthy" you are you need to find out how much body fat you have. Healthy is generally under 10% body fat. Keep in mind that muscle is twice as dense as fat. Therefore if you are really muscular, you'll way more.    Any body building regiment mixes good cardio work outs with endurance and strength training. Cardio involves more aerobics to maintian flexibility as well as exercises that burn calories an maintain heart health and blood circulation.     If I were you I would recommend at least 30 minutes of intense cardio (some aerobics coupled with 20 minutes of running, jumping jacks, tredmil or anything like that) work out and at least an hour of strength training (squating, dead lifting, bench press, military press and so on).    Aside from good exercise you should be maintaining a healthy diet and drink plenty of water. Which actually your water content can also affect your body weight - but is still healthy.|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	125 is very little for you.   I think you should continue to work out and pay attention on your diet. Right now set your mind on 150.   One you reach that milestone, see how you feel. If you want to loose more weight, then go ahead and set your mind on 140 maybe.   Take it step by step, don't push it too hard and overwhelm yourself.

AA11575735	First off, sounds like you need a medical check up. Never take chances with your health.    On the other hand it sounds like you have a good muscle base but aren't fully flexing your muscles. If you tighten up really fast during work outs, you aren't going to the full extension.  Ask a trainer to watch you work out and suggest changes.    Did you know that for movies like X-men they exercise right before shooting so that their muscles are pumped up tight!|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	This is normal.  Run one day and lift the next.|`|AA11971658	The pumped feeling is simply blood rushing to the muscle you are working.  It is not a determining factor of whether or not the workout is good or bad.    If it's uncomfortable, try stretching out first. It is important to warm up.  Working a cold muscle is unsafe. Also try changing up the order of your exercises. For example, if you are doing bicep curls first try moving pull-ups to the front of your routine.|`|AA11585288	you may be dehydrated or havent warmed up properly  A pump is when the blood circulation increases in the muscles exscersized.    potassium helps to avoid cramps while working out , so if you are cramping up eat a banana 30 mins prior to your workout    Stay hydrated   Warm up properly    hope it helps.|`|a1d33c79fcd80691d09f4a4a7d20d0b3aa	It's normal for you!

SsVfYJFEaa	Testosterone is a powerful anabolic hormone that stimulates and controls the development of muscle, bone, skin, sex organs, and most other masculine, physical features.  Male testosterone is produced in the testes by a group of cells known as the Leydig cells. These cells begin secreting high doses of testosterone during puberty to trigger increased lean muscle mass, sex organ development, bone formation and higher energy levels. Testosterone levels peak during a man's early to mid twenties.There's comes a time that testosterone decreases especially to old men or to some men who love to build muscles and those athletes. Some supplements are available to prevent this. Axis-HT is availabe which helps for the production of testosterone and related androgens. To have good muscle size, shape and hardness and most especially it helps you increase your sexual drive and performance (pro-erectile aphrodisiac effects).|`|649aced9013d08e429dcccb32cfd665baa	Causes for decrease in testosterone levels  1.Alcoholism  2.liver disease  3. Drugs, including androgens and steroids, can also decrease testosterone levels. (Prostate cancer responds to androgens, so many men with advanced prostate cancer receive drugs that lower testosterone levels)    Maintaining Healthy Levels of Testosterone   Diet  -Eat moderate amounts of protein  -Eat more vegetables and fruit and limit excessive carbohydrate intake especially of simple sugars and starches (grains, potatoes, pasta)  -Essential fats such as the omega 3 fatty acids found in fish and flaxseed as well as saturated fats are essential for normal testosterone production.    excercises:  Both the lack of physical activity and excessive physical activity (over training) will result in decreased levels of testosterone.   -Testosterone levels will elevate with exercise for about 45 to 60 minutes. After this time period, cortisol levels begin to increase and testosterone levels will decline.   -do not train for more than 45 to 60 minutes at a single session. If you feel like you want to exercise or train more, split sessions are recommended.  -do not lift weights and perform aerobic training at the same time.    Emotional Stress   -Dont sweat the small stuff and it is all small stuff", stay well rested and take your time eating frequent small meals. This will help normalize cortisol levels and allow your anabolic system to take over again.
cSGqzghoaa	Alright, you question was about the best way to "build up muscle", so that's what i'll answer:    You lift weights, run, or do excercises like push-ups and sit ups. HOWEVER, to build muscle doing these things, you have to be lifting/doing something you can only repeat 6-8 times, 10 is okay as well. So if you can do 50 pushups, doing regular push ups won't help you much. You can use a backpack or something to make the push ups harder, though. And as for running, you'd have to do sprinting, or really, really fast (for you) running with low distance (no more than a mile). That's for building up leg muscle (i'm not saying you shouldn't do long distance, but that does not directly address your question. You should do it though, since it is great for your heart and stamina gaining)    Besides doing weight that is really heavy for you (the whole 6-8 times, maybe 10 thing), you also have to eat plenty of food; or at least make sure to get enough protein, vitamins, minerals, etc. Most people pay most attention to protein intake, but chances are you're already getting enough protein (unless you're on a "weight loss" diet or something), so i doubt you'll need to change your diet.    Oh yeah, before work outs, remember to warm up, otherwise you could really mess up your muscles. For the warm-up, you CAN, and SHOULD use weight that you can do a good number of times (like some light jogging if you can do this for a long time, or some 5-10 pound dumbells if this weight is pretty easy for you to rep).    Now, what I said above mainly addresses the "way to build up muscle", not how to get toned or lose weight, or anything of the like (although, if you do the stuff above, you should still gain tone and lose weight in fat anyway). The only thing i didn't tell you about that is THE way to gain muscle, or at least the way Arnold and many other bodybuilders around did it: steroids. Don't use them. I mean, you technically are using them (all of us are), but this is the amount that your body produces, so it's all naturally regulated by your body. However, injecting or consuming additional steroid hormones can really mess up the sync of your body. Don't do it.     So those are the basics of building muscle. Good luck with your bodybuilding.|`|AA11272380	Lifting weights builds muscle.      If you want to tone and tighten, use less weight with more repitions.

However if you really have to try and make yourself feel better, just cut out the high fat, high sugar foods, eat porridge for breakfast (made with skimmed milk) and a handful of sultanas, eat a bowl of chopped salad with a small chicken breast (or any lean meat or fish) for lunch, and fruit with natural yoghurt for after, for your main meal eat fresh steamed  fish and vegetables, have another piece of fruit as a snack. Cut out the fizzy drinks and drink fresh water, limit your tea or coffee to just two drinks per day (if you have it) do not forget to drink 2 - 2 and a half litres of fluid in total per day (including tea, coffee etc).

IEfg6MDVaa	I am not sure a heating pack is a good idea with a kidney infection.  This will likely increase the pain because it increases inflammation.  The kidneys are in a capsule and when they swell with infection this is what causes the pain.  The heat will increase the swelling.  Try something cool.  The antibiotics take a couple of days to get working well and then a few more to decrease the infection enough to decrease the inflammation.   Probably day 4 or 5 you will notice a big difference.

Much pain is from muscles below is an example of what may help (based on headaches).  Begin with a couple swigs of molasses or a couple of bananas (they are both muscle relaxers) daily - magnesium (which regulates many things in the body) and potassium (a needed building block for muscles).  Drink at least 1/2 gallons of water per day. Running a body low on water is like running a car low on oil is the analogy the head of neurology at UCDavis told my husband about 10 years ago.    Now to the cause - muscles - your back, neck shoulders and head have tender spots. They are knots in the fibers of the muscles called trigger points. It makes the muscles tight which makes them press on nerves and other things causing the pain.    The cure - start with a professional massage, you will also want to go back over any place you can get to 6-12 times per session up to 6 times per day rubbing (or lightly scratching on your head) every where that is tender until the knots go away. The place where the skull connects to the spine press up under the edge of the skull (to get to those muscles).    For more information read The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook by Davies. It teaches what to do and where the pain comes from.
Ig2I7t0paa	It sounds like what you did was dislocate your knee and then pop it back in very quickly, even though it sounds like a fairly small dislocation go see your doctor and get them to check up on it. When you dislocate a body part the Ligaments get stretched out and do not return to normal size so after each dislocation it will be easier for it to happen again. If it happens once or twice more you may have to go to Physical Therapy and they will give you some exercises to tighten the ligaments back up a little bit. If the dislocations become to frequent then minor surgery may be required.

For an aerobic workout you should do the treadmill or if you can't get to a gym on a workout day just take a 30 run/jog. You should not strain your muscles when lifting weights just do a weight that feels good for your muscles. But if you want to have a good diet, just have like a bowl of cereal for breakfast or like a yogurt and then to lose weight just don't eat snacks in between meals and if you really need a snack have an apple or a banana or other fruits and vegetables. Have lunch and then have dinner and have a small dessert. Also, there is a thing that I say every single time I reach for a snack I think "Am I hungry or am I so bored that I think I am hungry?"

This causes minerals and other substances in urine to form crystals on the inner surfaces of your kidneys. Over time, these crystals may combine to form a small, hard mass, or stones.  Most small kidney stones pass into your bladder without causing any permanent damage. Still, it's important to determine the underlying cause so that you don't form more stones in the future, so you should consult an Urologist. In many cases, you can prevent kidney stones simply by drinking more water and making a few dietary changes.|`|8uF06LE3aa	I would recommend you talk to a urologist and find out if your diet might be contributing to the number of stones you have.

Stay away from sugar and salt... try a vegan diet.  Also, how tall are you?  55kg is not enough information.. If you were 5'1 you would not be underweight!  Working out also keeps your stress levels down, you sleep better and people who work out are generally happy.  It will not happen overnight so do not get discouraged.  It takes awhile (months for some) to see "results" but you will get stronger each time you work out...

If you don't have a gym, there are lots of things that you can do at home. The traditional sit ups and pushups are great examples. You should be able to find some good websites that can help you with a routine and tell you how to do the exercises (The only ones I know are bodybuilding sites, so I can't help you with finding a site). Don't forget walking, jogging, biking or rollerblading too!    Remeber to warm up with a bit of cardio activity, and stretch when you're done your workout.     Don't overdo it. Many people are excited about starting a fitness routine, and go over board on the first day. You should be a little sore the next day, but if it lasts for more than a day or is really bad, you did too much. (it's hard to say what would be the right amount of exercise without knowing your goals, current activity levels, etc) Have fun!

97df24e660c753726da91950f8e97491aa	Baldness - What are the causes of excessive hair loss?  All of us lose hair. A loss of up to 100 hairs a day is normal, as this hair loss is replaced. Excessive hair loss which is not replaced leads to baldness or alopecia.    Baldness or Alopecia, as your Doctor would call it has Several Causes:  Many systemic diseases can cause diffuse hair loss. Any prolonged debilitation (typhoid, viral fevers, malaria, operations, accidents and even child birth) can be followed by diffuse loss of hair. Mental stress must be included as a cause of this type of baldness it can cause severe forms of baldness. Hair begins to fall about 3-4 months after the illness and continues for about 3-4 weeks. Most of the hair which is shed, however, regrows in about 3 months. Nutritional deficiencies, crash dieting and anorexia nervosa are all also associated with hair loss. Anemia is an important cause of hair loss in women. Hormonal disorders specially thyroid diseases and diseases  of the ovaries are often associated with hair loss. Some medicines like contraceptive pills and anti-cancer drugs can also cause baldness.    Male Pattern Baldness   The commonest form is the baldness that affects men. It is called male pattern baldness. The hair loss in this condition depends on two factors, namely the presence of male sex hormones (the androgens) and a genetic tendency to develop baldness. One out of every ten men is likely to develop some degree of male pattern baldness by the age of 25; by the age of 35, four out of ten men show male pattern baldness; and by the age of 50, nearly half of all men are in the condition of male pattern baldness.    The age of onset and the pattern of baldness and the rate at which it will progress are all inherited. Generally speaking, the sooner the baldness starts the more severe it is likely to be: so if a person has got a pretty good head of hair at the age of 35, he is very likely to keep it for a good many years more.    Baldness in Women   Androgen dependent baldness can also occur in women. Small amounts of androgens are normally present in all women. If you have a very strong family background of male type of baldness, then your hair is probably very sensitive to even the low levels of androgens normally present in women. However, the pattern of hair loss in women is totally different. In them, hair is lost from the whole scalp and they do not generally develop obvious baldness. Acne and hirsutism may be associated with this pattern of baldness in women.    Alopecia Areata   The third type of baldness is called alopecia areata. Patches of baldness first appear on the scalp, but can spread to the eyebrows and eyelashes as well. In men the beard area may be involved. The patches develop rather suddenly and may be precipitated by stress. Fortunately, most of the time, the problem resolves on its own - the hair begins to regrow spontaneously within a few months. This pattern of alopecia is more commonly seen in men and is sometimes associated with leucoderma and diabetes.    Some, diseases of the scalp can also cause baldness. Many people think that dandruff causes hair loss but this is not true. In children, fungal infections commonly lead to hair loss. Sometimes, bacterial infections can cause baldness.    Physical Trauma   Finally physical trauma also results in hair loss: this type of hair loss affects women more often than it affects men. Tight hair styles, like pony tails for instance, literally pull the hair out by the roots. Baldness usually appears in the front of the scalp and improves once the hair style is changed for a looser one. Using hair brushes with stiff nylon bristles can also cause baldness, as also using combs with tough teeth. Too much exposure to hot air can cause similar problems too, so you must use a hair-dryer with care.    Baldness Remedy  Baldness is an embarrassing problem and there is no treatment for several types of alopecias. So a huge range of commercial baldness remedies claiming to increase hair growth have appeared in the market. Whether anything will help, depends largely on  the cause of the baldness. There are no magic cures and a good many of the products available are absolutely useless. Many of the preparations sold for the treatment of baldness are advertised with accompanying photographs showing before and after treatment pictures. These look very convincing, but if an individual with alopecia areata uses a hair restorer and improves, the restorer gets the credit when in fact the hair growth might well have begun spontaneously. Similarly, hair which is lost after prolonged illness will regrow without the help of any 'medicines.    What you can do, if you are suffering from baldness, is to make sure that any causative factor is dealt with. Consult your skin specialist for this and if he finds a cause for your alopecia, he would treat it and your hair would regrow.    Male pattern alopecia is one type of baldness which is difficult to treat. Even in this, now treatments and remedies are encouraging, though they may be expensive.    1. The easiest and the cheapest solution is to grow the remaining hair, and then to restyle it to cover the baldness affected areas. Conditioning the hair would give body to the hair; but these methods can be resorted to only in mild cases of baldness.    2. A new drug, minoxidil, is now available to give relief to many balding scalps. It should be used only under strict medical supervision, because even though it is applied locally, serious side-effects can develop. A real problem with minoxidil is the high cost of the medicine.    3. Another rather expensive solution to baldness is hair transplantation. Hair transplantation was first used by Orentreich in 1959. It is based on the fact that hair, when transplanted from a hair producing area to a bald area of the scalp,|`|03217130245f1b93d3cbc137d0c79866aa	My daughter was stressed-out and developed Alopecia Areata (baldness in spots).

In Western society, hair loss  especially male pattern hair loss  is fodder for jokes, unless the hair loss is a result of chemotherapy or other medical treatments. If you're suffering from situational baldness or male/female pattern baldness, you may laugh about it among your friends. Chances are, however, that you're crying about it in privacy. But by no means are you alone. Fortunately, there are many natural remedies to relieve hair loss and the personal embarrassment that results from it.    We can blame the typical American diet for yet another unfavorable thing: Hair loss. American's high-fat, high-animal protein and high-salt diet damages the kidneys and creates acidic blood, thereby leading to hair loss, according to Paul Pitchford's Healing with Whole Foods and Janet Zand's, Allan N. Spreen's and James B. LaValle's Smart Medicine for Healthier Living. The typical American diet is also usually low in vitamins. This lifestyle leads to vitamin deficiency, which is another cause of hair loss. And thanks to the globalization of fast food chains and the American diet, we're exporting hair loss overseas.    If your diet is relatively healthy, you may have to scrutinize other potential causes and use the process of elimination to determine the cause of your hair loss. For example, do you dye your hair or treat it with other chemicals? According to Bill Gottlieb's Alternative Cures, these treatments may be thinning your hair. Similarly, have you been experiencing a lot of stress in your life? Stress may literally be making you pull your hair out.    If you're a woman: Are you pregnant, menopausal or on birth control pills? These are three big factors in female hair loss. Hormone imbalance is arguably the most common cause of hair loss in females. Pregnancy, menopause and sometimes birth control pills can create hormone shifts, according to The Doctor's Book of Home Remedies for Women. In fact, according to Dr. Neal Barnard's Eat Right, Live Longer, "Childbirth almost always causes some degree of temporary hair loss, sometimes occurring after a delay of a few months In other animals, this has a useful function; rabbits, for example, line their nests with shed hairs. Humans have less use for it." So unless you're intent on finding new ways to decorate your baby's room, you're just going to have to wait out the temporary hair loss. Excessive dieting also causes hormone shifts. Hair loss is thus one of the major symptoms of anorexia and bulimia.    Hair loss doesn't have to be controlled entirely by genetics  If your hair loss is caused by a controllable factor, such as using chemical hair dyes, then by all means, change your behavior. Take vitamin supplements, stop dying your hair, change your shampoo or choose a different method of birth control. On the other hand, hair loss could also be genetic. No, you can't alter your genes yet. But you can rely on natural medicines to help counteract an inherited hair loss trait. Vitamin E, Golden Maidenhair (found in a tea shampoo), red sage extracts (also found in some shampoos) and formulas that mix turmeric with horsetail or oat straw are all found to prevent or slow the process of hair loss. Additionally, eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in starch may slow down the hair loss process, according to Arthur C. Upton in Staying Healthy in a Risky Environment.    The average human sheds between 50 and 100 hair strands every day. If you're shedding more than that, you don't have to accept it as a burden you must bear. A little lifestyle change goes a long way to stop hair loss. If your parents or grandparents exhibit hair loss, you're not doomed, but you do have an even greater need to watch your diet and use herbal remedies. If you do start losing your hair, however, handling it well can make all the difference between hair loss becoming a source of embarrassment or a fashion statement.|`|ICBKpZeAaa	Lots of info here.

I used a protein based diet after a friend who had lost a lot of weight with this recommended it to me. All the way through you feel great and energized, you also get great coaching and support along the way. The people are very friendly and gave me lots of great advice. I needed to lose 40 pounds and I did so with no problems. The products really work and you feel great whilst losing weight. I lost all my weight in less than four months and they have helped me to keep it off. I would definitely recommend using them. My sister did this also and lost 76 pounds in five months (She works out, I dont). There is no pressure and they will even send you a load of free samples so you can try before you buy. The samples were the thing that initially convinced me that this was the right diet for me. You also a get a free complete health consultation with the samples, I just paid the postage and handling, but for what I got it was well worth it. You just go to www.myhealthabc.com to register your details to get the free samples and the free advice etc and then they just call you up and ask you a few questions. It was so easy.

Usually anger comes from lack of self confidence   and somewhere along the line you have something that has triggered that anger.  So the best thing to try and think back to see if you can resolve it on your own, but if you can't get help because it can get worse and then the solutions get farther away.  Its not a virus just a problem that has necessity to find what is triggering it so you can understand why you get angry and then put yourself in control.  Good Luck  Rosy

AA11227706	If your teeth are sensitive, you could try using a special type of toothpaste like Sensodyne (spelling error???)|`|J0bqxozSaa	Many people suffer from sensitive teeth. Having sensitive teeth can mean a great deal of discomfort, sometimes on a daily basis. Discomfort may be sporadic or constant throughout the day. While it usually comes and goes, it is often directly related to some trigger, such as hot or cold food and drink or pressure applied to the teeth. The good news is there are things you can do to manage the discomfort and protect your teeth.    The clinical term for sensitive teeth is dentin hypersensitivity. It can occur for many reasons, but if the sensitivity is extreme or continuous, you should consult with your dentist. The underlying cause may be related to nerve problems affecting the teeth or may be due to poor oral care resulting in receding gums or gum disease. Bacteria within plaque and tartar can play a major role in causing gums to recede, so the use of a good antibacterial mouthwash may be helpful. Also, use a fluoride rinse with a high concentration of fluoride to help protect against plaque build up.    There are kits available for people with sensitive teeth, which offer toothpastes and other care products designed especially for sensitivity problems. A toothpaste made for sensitive teeth will generally include an agent to deaden pain at the roots. A kit may also supply a soft toothbrush or a gentle electric toothbrush to help you avoid brushing too hard. Brushing too strenuously can damage teeth, so taking care to brush more gently is an important step.    Another step you can take to protect sensitive teeth and limit pain is to avoid foods and drinks with high levels of acidity. The main culprits are soft drinks and tea, as well as various citrus fruits or foods and beverages with high concentrations of citric acid. To prevent sensitive teeth, avoid these items or immediately clean your teeth after consuming them, rather than allowing acids to sit on your teeth.    If you try everything but still suffer from sensitive teeth, ask your dentist about other treatment options. He or she may apply a substance directly to the roots to help ease your pain or apply prescription-strength fluoride treatments. He or she may also decide to bond your teeth to protect porous surfaces from damage or from penetration by foods and bacteria.    Again .. DO NOT FORGET     Foods - hot, cold, sweet or sour - can cause pain in a sensitive tooth. Touch or even air can be bothersome, too.    Usually the pain stems from enamel erosion or gum recession. The April issue of Mayo Clinic Health Letter offers tips to manage the problem:    Use a desensitizing toothpaste -- They contain compounds that help block sensation that might otherwise stimulate pain in the tooth's nerve. Choose a product that displays the American Dental Association's Seal of Acceptance.    Avoid using whitening or tartar control toothpastes as they may increase sensitivity to hot or cold.    Brush properly -- Use a soft toothbrush and brush with short back-and-forth strokes and a gentle up-and-down motion. Brush thoroughly, and floss daily.    See your dentist -- If you still have discomfort when brushing, flossing, chewing or drinking, you may need dental treatment. Sometimes coating sensitive areas of affected teeth with a fluoride gel or special desensitizing agent helps. If the culprit is tooth decay, a cracked tooth or worn filling, these should be treated.|`|AA12282110	I don't know about the teeth wriggling thing--but those sensitive teeth tooth pastes are really good for sensitive teeth.

De todos modos, esto ayuda a menguarlos:  -Empieza a disminuir de peso si ests gordita.

Therefore, less food from the basic food groups and fewer essential calories are needed.    Heres a bit more info"    There's a rule-of-thumb formula for estimating how many calories you burn at rest. For men: Add a zero to your weight and then add twice your weight. For women: Add a zero to your weight and then add your weight. Using the formula, your expected resting calories needs would be 2,100 a day. (To 175 add a zero, giving you 1,750, and to this figure add two times 175, or 350, for a total of 2,100.)    This is an estimate of the number of calories it would take to maintain your weight if you did nothing but vegetate. To determine total calorie needs, you have to add calories for general activity and exercise. With your desk job and workouts, you probably burn one-half again your resting needs, for a total of 3,150 calories (2,100 plus 1,050 equals 3,150). If you were engaged in a regular aerobic exercise program, you would require more calories. On the average, walking or jogging a mile consumes about 100 calories.    As general information, you'll be interested to know that, according to the National Research Council, the average woman (5'4", medium frame, not too thin, not too fat) who does not exercise needs 1,600-2,400 calories a day to maintain body weight. The average man requires 2,300-3000 calories a day to do the same.    And one more thing, if you are walking around hungry try the Atkins diet. You can pig out on the right foods and maintain weight or lose, its up to how many carbs you eat a day. Take care!!|`|62fec9b1a0dbb0b67ce7514beb9e2cc8aa	no, its normal dont worry about it =)

Es muy peligroso que te lo administres t solo. Adems cuando hay alteraciones elctricas cerebrales el antidepresivo, lejos de ayudarte te puede incrementar la ansiedad. Mejor acude con un Psiquiatra. Adems podr evaluar los factores emocionales de tu depresin.

But in the first place, what's the question?|`|4a8723a2941488a3fef88e364558d865aa	Here we go again with another "penis length/size" question.   Average is about 5 to 6 inches. Penises come in a variety of sizes. Your penis size will be the size you are given! There are no pills or creams, no toys or tools that will make a penis longer or larger. Any product claiming to do that should be regarded as being suspect. Likely it is a scam and the only thing that will get bigger is the wallet or bank account of the person/company offering the product. Look closely at the promotions and you will see that the product is not tested, inspected, approved or endorsed by any reputable organization. If it works why has it not been submitted to the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration for FDA Approval. If you are concerned that your penis is not large enough then consider that the average length is 5.5 inches and frankly that is plenty large enough. Read some of the posts from females who are afraid of the "huge" penises out there. Sure the "American thing" is "bigger is better" but that is not always the case. If you are concerned about the ladies pleasure - and that should be your main concern, you should develop a technique or style that makes the most out of what you were given.   It is important to remember that sexual intercourse is not simply a piston going back and forth at a high speed. Actually a lot of the "jocks" haven't figured that out yet. If you work at developing a style you will score more and it will be more fun for both of you.  And it will be fun learning the technique.  And if you are still wanting to do something to make your penis bigger, each night before you climb into bed, get down on your knees, bow your head, and pray for a larger penis. Trust me, you stand a better chance this way than with any tools or toys|`|AA10232591	hu ?|`|PBCNigAfaa	The size of your penis is simply determined by factors, called genetic traits, which you inherited from your parents. There is nothing you can do to increase or decrease the size of your penis -- it will develop into its adult size as you change from a boy to a man through the process called puberty. Most boys start the changes of puberty between 10 and 14 years of age, though a few will start earlier or later than these ages. First, the testicles (balls) begin to enlarge and then hair starts to grow around the them. The penis then starts to enlarge, first in length and then later in thickness. Though there is much normal variation, the final penis size is reached four to six years after the testicles first started to enlarge.   This process of normal penis growth can be disturbing to many males. Since the testicles enlarge first (and later followed by growth of the penis), many young male teens do not notice the testicles growing and worry that they are not changing and that their penis is too small. If you are overweight, fat tissue can hide the penis somewhat and give an impression that the penis is smaller than it really is. Some males in your class may have started their changes of puberty well ahead of you and they may seem like they have an adult-size penis-that can be very upsetting! It is difficult to know how large a penis will be in its erect state, simply by looking at it when not erect (or when flaccid).   It is also true that adult penis size varies considerably from person to person. Just as with any body part, different people will have different penis sizes. We live in a society that pushes a myth that the male with a larger penis has a better sex life than one with a smaller penis. This is constantly noted in sexual jokes, in comments heard on TV, or in the movies and in many other places. Well, the truth is that normal penises vary tremendously in size, and sex is just as good for each of these males. You will need to wait a year or two after your overall height has stopped changing to see what final size your penis will be. If at any time during your growing, you are worried that your penis is abnormal, just go to your doctor and ask him or her directly about this. In almost every case, you will be told that it is fine.       http://www.coolnurse.com/penis_size.htm  http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_he...  http://www.teenhealthfx.com/answers/sex-...

RD1uEbGWaa	Your daycare needs to have a Health Policy in place that will help reduce the spread of illness in the program.  The policy needs to include the criteria for excluding an ill child from care; requirements for cleanliness of the facility, toys, etc.; and guidelines for handwashing.       On your part, make sure you wash your hands very frequently.    Also, if you are new to teaching (or even to this particular daycare), you will need time to build up immunities.  I was sick constantly my first year of teaching, but following years were much better.  Hang in there!

pa7hVLAHaa	There are many things which could cause frequent urination.  If they did a blood test at the ER they would have found any biochemical causes.  Since you said your results from your urinalysis (you didn't mention blood work) came up negative, and the ER doc felt a lesion on your left pelvic region maybe the cause of your frequent urination is mechanical.  The bladder has stretch receptors which tell the brain when its full.  If a lesion is putting pressure on the bladder, this could activate the pressure receptors and make you have to urinate frequently.  Your OB found no unusual lesions of the ovaries with the ultrasound, yet your symptoms continue...    What else could put pressure on the urinary bladder?  Chronic intestinal inflammation is one possibility.  If you have any GI symptoms (gas, bloating, constipation, diarrhea) you may want to consider investigating your diet for any food sensitivities.  I mention this because I experienced a similar situation.  In my case, wheat causes intestinal inflammation which makes my intestines swell and put pressure on my insides including my bladder.  After numerous doctor visits with negative results and puzzled doctors, I solved my own problem by keeping a diet diary and doing an elimination diet.    First, if you do, stop drinking caffeine.    Then, keep a 7 day food diary noting everything you eat and the subsequent symptoms you feel. Once you have collected your data, analyze it to see when your symptoms are the worst. Try to correlate that with what you ate earlier that day.    Next try an elimination diet. Eliminate one of the suspected foods from your diet for 2-3 weeks. If your symptoms improve then you've found the culprit. If not, then try the next suspected food.    .  FYI: the top food allergies/sensitivities in this order are  -dairy (milk, cheese)  -wheat (gluten)  -eggs  -soy  -nuts (almonds, peanuts)  -corn  -shellfish

wRtzGgRxaa	Quit smoking, first of all.  Avoid caffeine.  Marijuana will be stored in your fat so if you have any excess of that, you should try to lose it.|`|9F0iuuMYaa	I am not going to help you. You made the mistake.    >.|`|2WtPKZvfaa	Shouldn't done it in the first place!  It stuff your brain up.    Depending on how much you smoke, it takes 2-5 weeks, during which time it can be detected on a drug screen. If you need to pass a drug test for a job or any kind of certification, I wouldn't chance it; you should stay "clean" for 6 weeks. Super fast "detox" potions are expensive and unreliable.     Marijuana can be detected in your urine for at least five weeks. If you want to pass a drug test, don't do any for two months to be extra sure.   30-45 days   Hair tests are even worse, since your body stores THC in the hair follicles. For this reason, the previous answers to How long does marijuana stay in your system? are only useful if youre going to be forced to take a urine test. For the hair test, depending on the amount of hair that the company takes, its possible that marijuana could be detected up to three years after the last time that you smoke.|`|mhLaOFZRaa	I am a grandmother and I am totally against what you have done.

Yu7y6yfraa	honey bees do.  I believe all bees do.  Part of the bees abdominal area comes out with the stinger.|`|16BAkagYaa	Any kind of bee, not yellow jackets or wasps,  but bees.|`|YC8X25OXaa	All bees - it is wasps and hornets that can sting you over and over.  The bees die because their stings are, to put it bluntly, attached to their guts.  And the stings have little barbs or hooks on the end which catch on you after they sting.  This means that when the bee moves away, the sting stays inside you and it pulls their insides out with it.  Obviously the bee can't survive without its insides, so it dies.    Wasps and hornets, on the other hand, have toxins in the ends of their stings.  So they just jab the sting in you, release a little of the toxin (which is what makes it hurt and swell up, and why many wasp stings can kill you) and then pull the sting out again, like jabbing you with a needle.
UnSTw2Zeaa	Also called Tramadol.It is supposed to be non -narcotic, however because it does still give you that euphoric feeling, it is very addictive.

AekVyLneaa	There are so many causes of pneumonia.  One that is seen quite frequently in the elderly is aspiration pneumonia.  This is when the food/fluid goes down the airway.  It can happen when the are eating or when they are done eating and some of the food comes up and enters the airways.  It can come from CHF (congestive heart failure).  The heart is not functioning properly, therefore fluid backs up into the lungs.  Smoking can cause damage to the lungs.  This can cause your lungs to not function properly, therefore making them more suceptible to pneumonia.  Any type of lung disease can make that individual more suceptibel to catching pneumonia.  It can happen when sterile technique is not used during a bronch, intubation, and extubation.  There are tons of causes to pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia.  I could spend all day telling you more causes.... but all in all pneumonia is foreign material (food, fluid, etc) in the lungs.

MEOjwPCNaa	A sensible diet and a consistent exercise routine are the only way to go. You already knew that.    Typically, the speed at which someone loses weight is inversely proportional to the likelihood of them keeping it off. Why? Meaningful, long-term success can come only from lifestyle changes. It probably took you months or years to add that weight--doesn't it stand to reason that it might take that long to effectively get rid of it?    The accepted wisdom is that 1-2 lbs. per week is a reasonable and maintainable goal. Much more than that and you're probably shedding water weight, which is unhealthy and which you will inevitably gain back when you stop dehydrating yourself. Starving inevitably leads to gorging, which is why crash diets don't work.|`|1ZZ2iemcaa	Question one Are you willing to follow a Strict diet.?  Questione two Aew you willing to follow a strick intese workout plan?  Questone three And but what are your current stats? Weight? Height?

Last time I had 103 temp, it turned out to be a very advanced case of strep (oddly with no sore throat).  Personally, I wouldn't go to the ER with it, but that is just me.  Now, if it was my child, I'd be more likely to make an ER run.  I usually take them to the doc when it reaches 101.  So, at 103, I'd hit the ER.|`|oAyI70W5aa	yes! 98 degrees or more it's urgent to go!    answermineplease  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|4d3Md9pnaa	Yeah. o___O;  I remember I got a 105 fever, my mom called my uncle who's a nurse...  he said if my fever STAYS like that, I need to go to the hospital.
FrLDHBLfaa	It's an interesting idea.  Someone would have to find a humane way of collecting it.  Then someone would have to volunteer to do the collecting.  It would be a good episode for the show "Dirty Jobs".|`|o5aHZ1Xdaa	no.     it would be expensive to create a synthetic equivalent (they wouldn't "milk" the liquid from real skunks)    mace or pepper spray contain thoughtfully created chemicals designed specifically to ward of predators.    skunk oil would not necessarily stop an attacker. It is not an irritant like mace or pepper spray, it would not stop them, it would just make them stink. It could serve to identify an escaped attacker but, again, they have a fluorescent spray specifically designed to do just that.    sorry,    Shamar|`|VR2biZutaa	Not in comparison to pepper spray...
364d7a1f957bf7c9aabbc05073bf0f58aa	You need to go back to the doctor.    Also, are you and your boyfriend using a condom? Condoms are only 98% effective, of course, so you can still get an STD...which is what your problem sounds like. Are you sure he is faithful? Are you faithful?    Again, it sounds more like an STD than a UTI if the antibiotic didn't take care of it. Also, you said it burned when you have sex, but you didn't mention that it burned when you urinate. Typically, it will hurt to urinate with a UTI. Did you finish ALL of the medicine? You have to take all of the prescribed pills AS DIRECTED (even if you start to feel better) or else the problem will not go away.|`|NXBmcEz7aa	You were infected by your bf.  Go and see your doctor again, ASAP!  If possible, see an specialist, not a GP.|`|m85emlXyaa	It doesn't sound like a UTI, it sounds like an STD.

Don't ask questions online, seek professional help.|`|AA10289302	i advise you to go back to your doctor and you should ask your bf to come alone,because if it"s an infection that you have he could maby giving it back to you after it was treated by the doctor,so please go back to Your medic,|`|zPGin01Kaa	HAHAHA
K7x1RHVFaa	The effects of both are similar. Heroin is more likely to destroy the soft tissues of the person and expose them to a variety of ailments. Meth is more likely to have the person thinking they are being attacked by bugs and pick at themselves.

7f8FtSw2aa	It depends on how fast the music is. This dancing: http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=myJj0mNNe1... obviously burns more energy than this dancing: http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=EixwB0uWPv... .    I don't think anyone's actually measured what it is for swing dancing though some figures for other forms of dance (for 1 hour for someone 130lbs):    Ballroom Dancing - 570 calories  Ballet - 623 calories  Waltz - 310 calories    I'd say that a song at about 120-180 beats per minute probably burns calories at a rate of 400-600 an hour whilst a song above 240bpm probably gets up to about 800 calories an hour.
23bs0kAKaa	Shy and that kinda stuff?     Yeah i used to be like that EXACTLY!  bullying at school started it, and then it started to move to hockey too     What i did was when i was people that i didnt know and didnt have to see again, i would kinda act almost silly, and fun and like the "popular kids" did and it was hard at first to be loud and outgoing and drawing attention to myself and stuff like that, but when i noticed that it was working and that people were more attracted to outgoing types it became easier, and dont be afraid to poke fun at yourself    So try it out in groups of people that you dont know and that you dont have to see again unless you want to then when you become more confindent transfer it over to where you normally are, you school etc.  you will see that doing this will boost your self esteem!    If someone calls you fat, be like, yeah, my man boobs are getting bigger by they day...

Walk down the street and smile at someone.|`|ikm8hJYZaa	Eat anxiety reducing natural substances.Cocoa is the best option in my opinion and experience.    The more you win over your fears the higher your self esteem will be and the less assistance you will need to win over them untill you start relying only on yourself.    Guaranteed to work.      Cocoa rich chocolate.Cocoa contains natural substances that reduce stress and pain and create a feeling of pleasure in your brain and increase your brain activity.How long effects last depends on how much you consume.Only a few pieces of high cocoa chocolate reduces your pain,anxiety or stress for most if not all day.Lindt exellence is my recomendation.The best chocolate you can buy and affordable to most people.You can find it in any store with large selection of items.The applications of cocoa are very wide ranging from consuming it before a dentist appointment to reduce pain and fear from the drill.It is very effective.    http://www.washingtontimes.com/weblogs/t...    While the cocoa effect lasts use this time to face your fears and say what you want to say and do what you wanted to do but were to afraid to do it.    Drugs are out of the question.Even though there are many anxiety reducing drugs they only do more harm then good to you and they are very expensive.Everything unnatural is harmful for your body.Drugs create the illusion of recovery.They cure nothing.
TX13gCoTaa	It is a strain of the chicken pox virus, so it is just a contagious as that. but it is unlikely that someone will get it. It is more likely to transfer to someone that has not had the chicken pox or the vaccination.|`|AA10841015	shingles is a form of the herpes virus. (so are genital herpes, chicken pox and cold sores) it will follow a nerve path either around the side of the body or around the side of the head. it is very contagious when it is open and draining. it will blister up then they burst and eventually scab over (that's when you are no longer contagious) and can be transmitted thru touch. anyone who has not had chicken pox, is pregnant, elderly, HIV or AIDS positive or have decreased immunity are more at risk for contracting the virus. good handwashing is the key to not spreading the disease. in the hospital you would be put in isolation to avoid the spread to already immunospressed patients. there are medications (antivirals) that will help shorten the life of the disease. it is very painful due to the nerve path involvement.|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	Very very very contagious - see following website for great info    http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/shing...|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	I just got it reading your question.     Just kidding.     "Shingles are contagious in certain circumstances. Shingles can be spread from the infected person to children or adults who have never had chickenpox. But, instead of developing shingles, the people who have not had chickenpox will develop chickenpox. Once these people have had chickenpox, they too have the potential to contract shingles later on in their lifetime.    Shingles are contagious when there are new blisters forming and old blisters healing. Once all the blisters have crusted over, the virus can no longer be spread.    Once a person has had chickenpox, they are no longer susceptible to another person who has shingles, in other words, they cannot catch the virus from someone else who is broken out with shingles blisters, whether they are crusted over or not."
Br3hJfDCaa	Or just don't wear skinny jeans. I've got naturally curvy hips as well so I know how to work with them (not against them).  Try wearing jeans with a wider leg in a darker colour - a flattering cut to wear. Skinny jeans only truly flatter certain body-types and can be a hard look to pull off if you happen to have curves. But if you have the confidence to wear them, the best of luck to you.    Anyhow, your friend could  be a bit jealous as well, because she has yet to get womanly curves herself.|`|5exiXAQbaa	Hey i love curves i think they are sexy|`|aFzqYyLSaa	Aerobics classes work well. I did zumba, and I loved it. Basically the routenes where you are working your sides and moving your hips. Zumba is a dancing sort of work out so it works well. You can probably find a video online or at the store if you don't want to join a class. The best way to keep it up is to do it with a partner!
LClnYk2vaa	First thing you need to do is find a way to lower your stress level.    The thing about your stress is, its stress that you shouldn't have.    You a worrying about other people's problems too much.    I'm not saying you shouldn't care, im just saying you care a bit too much.    I would recommend some breathing exercises to help lower your resting heart rate. Just do this.    Breathe in for 4 seconds counting as you inhale: 1....2....3....4...  Hold it for 4 seconds: 1....2.....3.....4....  Take 4 seconds to Exhale: 1.....2.....3.....4.....    Do this about 3-4 times every morning when you wake up, and whenever you feel stressed out.    Other methods are Screaming into pillows, counting down from 10, reciting the alphabet backwards, or just anything to take your mind off the situation.    If you need someone to talk to, you can call me and I'll listen.     I live in Washington state so im PST zone..    404-831-0614    Hope it helps!!! =]|`|edaWzdRDaa	I would advise you to pray and keep your heart light and be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.  You are strong and you shall pull through.  I have faith in you...    KTF my friend|`|xgrNAwa1aa	Our lives have totally different problems but everything you described is stress related depression and anxiety.  You are carrying the entire weight of your world on your shoulders and you need to draw a line for yourself and for your sanity.  I'm glad your Dad is back and your Sister had the baby as I hope that helps. I'm sorry about your Mom and I know you love her.  My own stress got so bad that I too stopped eating for the most part as every time I would eat, I would become literally ill.   I'm only 5'2" and went from 122lbs down to 103lbs within months and it wasn't healthy at all. I even looked sick like I was anorexic. To be 103lbs wasn't the danger. It was not eating as you can literally starve your heart muscle and do more damage internally.  You can't keep thinking you have to be every single person in your life rescuer. You can't control most of what is going on in any way but positive thinking.  Body pains, lack of sleep, poor appetite, along with becoming ill when you do try to eat is a sign of how serious your condition has become and I have to suggest you seek treatment for this if possible.  You need to talk to your Dad and tell him how you feel both physically and mentally and as far as stress goes; you are on the breaking point of what you can take.  No, you aren't having a breakdown but you are having an overload. To be emotional along with that and all the worries that come with life in general are hard for most of us but you have to learn better and healthier ways to cope with it.  Stress will always be near but you can't carry it on your back as it will only weigh you down and push you farther into depression.   Take it from someone who truly knows; know that you are the most important person because of these problems and that you need help and need to not have to do so much for others because you just can't right now.  There is nothing wrong with that. It is just a fact and you need to let everyone know that now you are the one who needs some relief, rest, and time to accomplish your own goals in life.|`|6nDqvtwbaa	You are spreading yourself too thin, seems like to me.    You need to cut something out to reduce your stress level.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	You have a lot going on in your life and that is usually what brings on the stress/anxiety.

MEOjwPCNaa	Absolutely. Especially for a nearly 2-hour workout! You need to replenish your muscles' supply of glycogen and provide them some protein so that the damaged fibers can rebuild.

Too close to work out time could give cramps or make you want to throw up. The only downside to eating after a work out is you tend to be really hungry and want to gorge all your hard work away. I would eat before, then if your hungry after have a snack.|`|067fa6dfc93e782fff815f1abe45eebaaa	After workout you need a dextrose sugar and protein. This meal should be taken within 15min after workout, 20min max!  If you could get a protein mix (soy protein, 100% whey. nothing with creatine or any other added supplement) and mix that with water (or milk, preferably fat free) eat that with some fruit, watermelon, cantaloupe, or bananas are great.     You should always eat afterwards, if not your hurting your body!

94eacd52d76b5f450c4b2099a14392d2aa	There have been only a handful of cases documenting endometriosis in the brain, but yes, it can and does happen.     In reviewing the literature that's out there, it seems like the main symptoms for these women were headaches, gait disturbances and seizures.|`|46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	You do not get endometriosis in your brain.    MS has a wide range of symptoms that are also common in other disorders. Visual problems may be the first symptoms of MS. It may take months to confirm a diagnosis of MS. The neurologist will run tests to look for MS as well as to rule out other possible causes.     Some diagnostic tests used are:  *Blood work - look for Vit B12 deficiency and Lyme disease markers  *MRI scans with intravenous gadolinium - identify and date lesions (plaques) in the brain. Newer lesions show up brighter.  *Evoked potentials - hearing, vision, and motor impulses are tested to see if they move normally or too slow.   *Spinal tap (lumbar puncture) - cerebro-spinal fluid is tested to identify cells that suggest MS. Can also be used to differentiate from Lyme disease.    For a definite diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, at least two separate symptomatic events or changes on MRI and a physical indicator (i.e. change in the central nervous system) must occur.    My MRI showed MS, but I passed my evoked potential and my blood tests couldn't differentiate between MS and Lyme (MS can cause a false positive for Lyme). So I had to have a lumbar puncture for the final diagnosis. Took about 5 mo. for me to get a definitive diagnosis.|`|AEAxZEveaa	What other kinds of health problems or symptoms do you have?    I honestly don't know. But do a google search of endometriosis and gluten. I saw a few articles that women saw a big improvement in their symptoms. Gluten intolerance (celiac disease or non-celiac intolerance) can cause MS like symptoms as well. I would try a gluten free diet to see if your symptoms improve. If they don't, you have one more thing ruled out.|`|681b68add2bda07a24306272e74aa052aa	I have MS AND Endometriosis.  It is highly unlikely that endo can even make it to your brain.  My gyno told me it's rare for endo to even get above your abdomen but has been seen on the lungs.    The brain and spine have a "blood brain barrier" and it is the disruption of this barrier that doctors think is what triggors the immune system response resulting in MS lesions.  This barrier is what makes it so somthing like a cold virus does not attack your brain or spine so if a cold virus cannot get into your spinal fluid, spinal column or brain then its very likely endo cells can't either.    You can be diagnosed with MS and not have "scarring" and there is nothing "typical or traditional" about MS - every case is very different.    I was diagnosed with MS and don't have scarring...just one major plaque that has come around a few times.
mAp90hEeaa	Your alcohol level is tested by a blood test and beer would give a positive blood result.  Other drugs are tested through the urine and if one of those came out positive, you will have to figure out where it came from because it wouldn't be the beer.  Depending on the reason you had this test in the first place (for employment), it will remain in your personnel file as long as you work for that company.

Does being with people help at all? Is it mostly when you are alone or does it not matter?    I feel that way too sometimes and I think it's normal, to a point. You sound like you have it bad and you need to talk with someone to figure out what you should do to help get over it.
AA11394576	5 minutes is not really enough time to do anything but savasana-- which should always be part of your practice as it gives your body an opportunity to integrate what you've done and should be helpful in preparing you for sleep by stilling your mind.  It is entirely appropriate to practice savasana by itself if you so choose.      Here's a good 15 minute practice: 10 breaths in down dog, 10 breaths in standing forward bend, 10 breaths in triangle on each side, 10 breaths in a simple twist on each side, however much time you need in legs up the wall, and finally savasana (at least 5 minutes).

Firmly tell the specialist that you will not take the Vallium and put yourself at risk when there are other options.  Also, see if you can talk to your primary again and explain the situation.  He/she should be willing to intercede on your behalf.  If you are still being pressured to got with the risky medication, seek outside help.  Also, document as much as possible.

8QrfXxaXaa	Hi,    Mouth breathing can occur in infants if they have a nasal congestion or runny nose. One of the causes of nasal congestion is allergies. Allergies can be related to food like wheat and egg white or can be environmental like dust, pollen or animal dander.  Insufficient suckling can also lead to mouth breathing in infants.  You have also mentioned wheezing which further points towards allergies. As of now it cannot be said for sure that his symptoms are due to asthma. Only a careful medical history and complete clinical exam will help in making a diagnosis.  Hope this helps!    Thanks,  Noopur|`|df1cca06887480a5dfed386bc1649768aa	sounds like an allergy maybe but definitely congestion  I would not wait and take him to the ER sooner  you have to get that out of him before it turns to pneumonia
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Your chances of having a heart attack increase if there is a family history, you are over weight, you smoke, have diabetes, are hypertensive (high blood pressure), and have high cholesterol. Prevention is always better than a cure, so making any appropriate life style changes will always help- This includes, losing weight, stopping smoking, reduce alcohol consumption and taking regular exercise.     Statins reduce blood cholesterol, which will prevent further fatty plaque deposits from clogging up the arteries. Despite the negative press, the vast majority of people who take statins do not experience MAJOR side effects. With any medication, particularly statins, the risk/benefit ratio should always be taken into consideration with the fact that the alternative of having high cholesterol is far more detrimental to your health.    Heart disease (including heart attacks) is the leading cause of death in the UK for both men and women. Among men aged between 30 and 69, 6 in every 1,000 have a heart attack in the UK.|`|181JNIudaa	Dear Sir,    If you can afford to, please exercise lots.  (gradually, to start with).|`|AA12266052	The chances of getting heart attack are greater if you have got diabetes mellitus, hypertension, high blood cholesterol [especially high LDL ("bad") cholesterol, triglycerides and low HDL ("good") cholesterol], too much fat in your diet, overweight, stress, smoking, getting older, being male, bad genes (hereditory factors) etc.  Dyslipidemia is elevation of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), or both, or a low high density lipoprotein level that contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. Causes may be primary (genetic) or secondary. Diagnosis is by measuring plasma levels of total cholesterol, TGs, and individual lipoproteins. Treatment is dietary changes, exercise, and lipid-lowering drugs.  Taking low dosage of aspirin daily will reduce the chances of heart attack.

Bm2SntgHaa	Uumm, your username is Gerard? Strange.    If you are a girl asking this question, there's really no right thing to do.     The only guy I've ever loved has changed his "status" from straight to bisexual to "maybe gay" and now back to straight again. Even though I have a suspicion that he is gay, I still love him and want to be with him. So even if your gut tells you that he just might be gay, or at least bisexual, it won't necessarily change the way you feel about him so "running like hell" or telling him good-bye isn't really an easy option.    If he convinces you that he is straight and you believe him, just let it go. We are all confused at times about many things and you can't blame him for that.    If you are a guy (I'm just going by your screenname) and you're maybe thinking of telling your girlfriend this, I'd say you should do it if you feel it's necessary to move on in your relationship. But if you don't feel that it is ABSOLUTELY necessary, then keep it to yourself for the time being until you've proven that you care about only her.

That works well for me. For the acne what I do is wash my face before I go to bed in the morning and when I get home from school that seems to work and after every time I wash my face I lightly moisturize it's all about the balance of oil.

Good luck!|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	Can you phone the Dr.s rooms & explain you wish to see the specialist on yr own?  She/he might be able to pass that on to the gynaecologist & when the Dr. calls yr name advise, "I'd just like to speak with the actual patient first", then you can discuss what you need to.  If yr mom gives you a funny look tell her you'll call her in after the initial discussion (doesn't mean you have to).

After you do this appointment, make another one on your own and go by yourself.  Pay at the desk so there is no bill, and tell them not to mail anything to your parents' home.  They should know how to handle that.    And if that doesn't work out, just go to Planned Parenthood.  They are very good and the doctors there are nice and they know exactly what to do for you.|`|xQQwiiIEaa	I think you should talk to your mom ahead of time or on the way to the appointment and tell her that you've decided to go into the exam alone. If you're going to have a gynecological exam, you can ask her to leave while you undress.  If she STILL barges in, ask again when the doctor comes into the room and hopefully the doctor will help you out. Remember, your mom is worried for you and might want to be there as your moral support!    Alternatively, you could ask your mom to stay with you until the doctor arrives. (Sorta like reverse psychology?)    Remember, if you get left alone with a nurse, tell him/her that you would like a chance to talk to the doctor alone. Unfortunately, you will probably have to fill out a form about your sexual history, so I'm not sure how you can dodge that.    Maybe you could get your dad/uncle/older brother to drop you off at the doctor's office? :)
08H81poqaa	I can completely relate to this feeling and thank you for sharing.  You are very in touch with your inner and outer self.  Some peeps won't be so honest.      I truly believe it has something to do with our bodies getting so use to sunlight when the days are longer, in fact if you think about this, sunlight is addictive and why wouldn't our bodies want an overload of vitamin D.  Once daylight savings time arrives and the days are shorter, we have to go through sort of a detox within.  It isn't easy, but just to remind you, the days are getting longer!  Just remind yourself how good it feels during the day and just allow yourself to feel the agony during during dusk.      Once the hours between 5pm and 8pm, I get better as the night goes on.   This is absolutely normal.

Or send a few thousand to some health expert to fudge the data?
ezI5HwRWaa	I do the same thing.    What helps is just when you find yourself thinking, stop. It's hard to just stop thinking completely so try counting "2...4...6....8..." and so on and mix it up "1....3....5....7...". If that doesn't work, try listening to a soft song that will help you to get tired. Not something emotional that will make you think.  Avoid doing things before bed that will get you thinking like watching a sad tv show or the news, talking with a friend (if you have to, don't let it be about anything that's going to upset you).     You could also try reading if none of the other things work. It will take time to make you tired though and could make you think, so it would depend.
W2z5dCrmaa	The prostrate gland is inside of a Dudes body just below the bladder, and it cuts of the urine flow ability when an erection is in progress. It also produces more than 2/3 of what makes up semen while the sperm only adds to that liquid to be energized, nourished by it, and to be protected by it's high Ph, in the vagina which is an acidic environment.  The core of the prostrate gland is the upper part of the urethra, below the bladder.      The prostrate gland is the source where all parts of semen get ejected into the penis tube..."urethra", with tubes in the gland as well as tubes coming from the seminal vesicles through the prostrate gland. Muscles inside the body core automatically squeeze tight on the seminal vesicles automatically during male orgasm in pulses and squeezes the semen out in spurts from the penis.    A dude can feel all of this going on during orgasm and it's awesome.    The prostrate can get enlarged in later years in life and cause problems by blocking the flow of urine. The reasons for enlargement is another story.    Testis are the testicles which hang in the sack,..scrotum outside the body for cooling...they produce sperm and testosterone, and do their best job at about 2 deg. f below body temperature...that's whey they are outside the body. They can swell and really hurt from something like the mumps or from being really built up with no sexual release. They don't enlarge per say like the prostrate can, but often shrink in old age when not so functional any more.    Hope that gives it for you?    Me! :- )|`|fJjgFWDRaa	Your prostate is a gland located internally, feeding into your urethra. When it gets enlarged, it squeezes your urethra and cuts off flow to a degree. Testis are external organs.. and that's about all you need to know.
W2z5dCrmaa	The licking is always sweet! Sucking the balls in and out of your mouth can be tense because balls are really tender and full of pain receptors for self protection if anything.    If you gently suck..slide the ball in and out and around inside the mouth without any tugging on the cords or teeth raking over the epidydimus, it can feel awesome. For sure don't suck hard and tug on the scrotum and the cords. That pulls inside on a Dudes engine and feels so not good for a Dude!

I'm sure  this will solve your problem.    Ok, you can see your doctor and ask him to help you out.  Maybe your vaginal opening is too small,  your doctor can fix that for you, a minor procedure, he will just give you a little snip nothing to it really.  I have a few friends who had it done just after they got married,  they never regretted it.  ask your doctor for the details.|`|24biipOpaa	i would say it just takes time. use lots of lube which will make it easier. and just continue working at it. you could also be one of those never ending virgins. or maybe your boyfriend could be too big for you or something. i would just work through it though.  i'm right there with you tho ugh it all still hurts for me everytime.|`|8pw8qDjPaa	I'm in your same situation. But for me it usually only hurts with the penetration and maybe the first 30 seconds, but it hurts everytime and i get really nervous before hand. After a while though the pain usually goes away and i get more comfortable with it.     A couple of keys are to make sure you're in the mood, relax, lots of foreplay, and try using extra lube.     If you're really concerned about it go see a doctor, but i'm not sure what they'll be able to do for you. It couldnt hurt to see what they say though.    Otherwise in a couple years I'm sure it will change and you'll "loosen up"|`|ldcs7OdXaa	Well I don't really think there is anything you can really do about it.

It could also be cause you are tense?|`|oluzjSgjaa	you need to be fully aroused.   if your bf sucks your nipples and plays with your clitoris for around 20 mins, you should be getting near your climax.   by this time you should be wet, and penetration should be more comfortable.|`|V6cwXXT8aa	Foreplay!!!  Seriously, when a woman becomes aroused her muscles loosen up down there allowing the male easier entry. If you are going straight to it too soon, your body will not be prepared for it.

0b484277348f6e6c1fa2aa39464c7caaaa	I am an oncology nurse and have worked with teens with cancer. The parents have to make time for both children. They need to have special days for Nicole so she does not feel left out. I will not be surprised if she secretly wishes she was sick to get attention, and that she may say she is sick to get attention. It is also very important that when Jade is in the hospital or recieving treatment that Nicole is included with the visits, She needs to see what her sister is enduring. Jade needs to have a support group of friends and have special days with them. And as for losing thier hair it will grow back, maybe straight, maybe another color. for now buying her cute hats and having Nicole pick them out with one for her will help. Good luck.|`|AA11156937	Get her a good wig ... it's expensive but it would definitely help her if she doesn't take it the wrong way.|`|SMsprdMfaa	I would say not to use chemicals on your hair.

f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	Having had a child with cancer I can tell you it's extremely difficult.  There are organizations here in Canada that help families and one that sends special gifts (t-shirts, beads, awards, etc.) to the SIBLINGS of kids with cancer, just so they dont feel left out.    There are also many organizations that support children and familiies with cancer, and camps that kids can go to.    You should look up the cancer society in your area, or find a children's hospital and talk to their social workers and see if there is something for that child.    At the very least they should be getting therapy and indeed the child "left out" from the attention needs special attention too.    Every small child needs to be DOTED on.  You can't spoil a child with too much love.  You can spoil them with too many trinkets and not enough love.    If you want to help, take her one day a week and take here somewhere special, where she can be doted on and made to feel like it's all about her and her happiness.    Even a small child understands that a sick child needs special attention so you can just re-inforce how difficult it must be for her parents to be so worried that her half sister might not be strong enough to make it through the chemo.  She needs to understand that Jade could quite possibly die and that her parents DO LOVE her but have to care for Jade.      So see if you can get a little network of support going for the family, dont just separate the children but include them all too but make sure Nicole gets her share of attention too.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Time to move on to a new story.

1QU88lbHaa	Most regular tampons are around the same size, to pick up a good amount of flow, so there isn't really a brand that makes tampons just for virgins, but there is other options than the regular sized ones. Go check some brands out. There should be "slim" or "light flow" ones. Just let her try out the smaller ones, if she feels comfortable using them then you can move onto other sizes.   TSS is a rare disease when a tampon is left in for a prolonged time, so regular changing and not sleeping with a tampon in helps eliminate that. I remember my first time using tampons at around 14 too, i would be so worried about it that i would change it even when it wasn't necessary.   Tampons are a girls saviour when having your period. No more odours, you can swim, more cleaner/tidier, takes up less room in your purse, less conspicuous & way more comfortable.  Good Luck!|`|GPvpBdlPaa	it is not really the brand that is the key if your worry is TSS. advice her to change her tampons frequently, wash hands in putting and removing it, don't use the maximum or thick absorbent because those are the types that bacterias like to thrive in. with proper knowledge and practise of good hygiene it is really not a problem. start from the smallest and slim size from there she can pick which is ok for her|`|fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Id have to say that it really isnt the best idea, what you have to consider is that tampons prevent vaginal cleaning and give bacteria somewhere to grow, over time bacteria multiply remaining trapped within the vagina along with decomposing menstrual material. Tampons also absorb vaginal fluids drying the vagina causing ulceration which along with certain bacteria causes TSS, many brands contain synthetics that cause more damage, and chemicals which increase bacterial growth. TSS is rare but no where near as rare as people claim, people are often also unaware of the other health risks associated with tampon use; various vaginal infections, increased flow and cramps, and tampons are linked to illnesses like cancer and endometriosis. Your daughter is at higher risk of infections and TSS because her vaginal walls are more delicate so more prone to damage, her immune system is also not as strong as an adults so she may not be able to keep up the fight if she was to contract TSS.     You need to be informed so you can inform her; in this day and age there is no reason for women to take the risk, particularly not with better options available, teaching her this now will be difficult so learn all you can. Take a look at TSS sites such as http://www.toxicshock.com and http://www.tamponalert.org.uk also sites about other tampon risks such as http://www.spotsite.org and http://www.frontiernet.net/%7Eruthb/Tamp... also how about more general tampon issues such as http://www.wen.org.uk/sanpro/reports/san... If you can also try to get the books The Sanitary Protection Scandal by Alison Costello, Bernadette Vallely & Josa Young, Whitewash by Liz Armstrong & Adrienne Scott, and Soap Opera by by Alecia Swasy.     I would strongly recommend that you not go for Tampax or any other commercial brands, bare in mind these are the companies who are responsible for TSS both in the 80s outbreak and today, and the dioxin scandal in the 90s. Tampon companies are self-regulated and there is no independent safety testing carried out on tampons, they continue to use ingredients they know to be harmful, throw into that advertising that makes girls feel embarrassed by their own bodies. They arent companies Id trust with my health let alone my daughters, from a purely health perspective they contain synthetics, additives, chemicals and bleach all of which seriously increase health risks. If she does use tampons then I would strongly recommend you get her organic tampons and explain why you bought these rather than the other brands her friends may use (shes a teen, Im guessing shell want a brand like Tampax). Organic tampons like Cottons http://www.cottons.com.au are just the same as commercial tampons only made from cotton and dont contain chemicals or bleach, this will significantly lower your daughters risk of contracting TSS and vaginal infections. Get the smallest size, her age isnt so much the factor as if she is comfortable with her body tampon insertion shouldnt be too difficult, but smaller size equates to smaller absorbency so lower risk  for each 1g increase in absorbency risk of TSS is increased by 37%. I would say to go for non-applicator first as it is one less thing to complicate insertion and one less thing she has to throw away, it is also more hands-on which will be better for her in terms of feeling comfortable about her body and menstruation. Advise her of the precautions she needs to take such as not using tampons at night or when not menstruating, alternating between tampons and pads (using tampons all the time increases risks by a factor of 33), and advise her of what to look out for with TSS and vaginal infections. I would also suggest giving her some tips such as masturbating before using a tampon to open and relax her vagina (good luck with that talk), or using lubrication such as KY jelly or olive oil, which you can get for her yourself. Oh and on the subject of pads, try suggesting to her organic pads which are much more comfortable than commercial pads so she may prefer using these to what she is using now, or you may want to consider cloth pads like Gladrags, periods belts like Reddys or padded panties like Lunapanties all of which your daughter would likely find far more comfortable than her current pads.    The absolute best thing I can recommend is trying to introduce her to menstrual cups like Divacup http://www.divacup.com (Ladycup are smaller so may be better for her) or softcups such as Instead http://www.softcup.com which are far safer and more hygienic than tampons as they dont absorb fluids, the vagina can carry on cleaning as normal, they cause no vaginal damage, dont allow for bacterial growth and dont contain harmful ingredients. Menstrual cups are bell-shaped cups made from either silicone or rubber that are folded and inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual flow, these can be left in for up to 12 hours safely, as they hold more fluid than tampons and create a seal they dont leak as tampons do so she will find them far more convenient, particularly for school. Menstrual cups are totally safe and hygienic, as they are smooth they are much easier to insert and easier to use, although they seem big they are actually the same size as tampons so shell have no problems with them. Another big advantage is that menstrual cups can be worn at any time including before her period is due to avoid mess, during the night and during very light to very he|`|iTP5CNtuaa	Tampax pearl. It's great for someone who has not had sex and is still quite intact down there. I find that even now, past your daughter's age, I use onoly those because they not only work the best but feel the most comfortable. Good luck to your girl!|`|V6cwXXT8aa	I wouldn't be as concerned about the brand of the tampon, but more about the size. I would start her out with the smallest size, so she can get used to them. If she needs to change it too often, try regular. She probably will not need super, and if she is using super, she may be leaving them in too long.  Personally, I wouldn't start her out with OB tampons either as they may take some experience before she would get a hang of them.   I know some women prefer cardboard, but most of whom i know prefer plastic. I would consider the tampax Pearl as it is more comfortable to use,  I find.|`|7WOx2C6Laa	She's too young for tampons!

We all have to face death, if not from cancer then from car accident, being hit by lightning, or quietly of old age - no one knows, so don't dwell on it.    Treatments have improved immensely over the years.

You sound like many other 13-14 yr olds. Your body is changing and you find that to be of concern, wondering if you are like others your age, wondering if you are average and healthy.    Usually 13 yr olds don't weigh 130.  Mild constipation - most people go anywhere from 2 or 3 times a day - to once every 2nd or 3rd day.  It's an individual thing.  It also depends on your intake of food and liquids - on whether or not you are emotionally upset - on your level of physical activity.    Concerning the skin issues, those can come from anything from what detergent your clothing is washed in, what soap you use on your skin, or even what foods you may be eating that you're allergic to.  (My own skin problems were from food allergic reactions.  Once we found out what it was, all I had to do was to leave it out of my diet.)  --When your skin is causing painful itching you can treat it at home.  1) use ice on a small affected area (like insect bites or rash)-numbs it.  2)  Take a pain reliever  -- lessens the painful itching  & 3)  at the same time take an anti-histamine  --helps the swelling to go down.  4)  for intense small areas you can use Ora-Jel or Numzit (for baby's teething) put it on skin or insect bites to numb the area for about 20 min.  -  just long enough to eat a meal or to fall asleep. (without scratching)    Given your age, development and concerns, I'd say it is time for you to write a brief list of questions for your Dr.  (10 or less)  Then go in for a yearly check-up and about your skin problems.   While there, ask your folks, letting them know you are now old enough to see the Dr by yourself.

Also most exercises won't do anything for the butt, you need to work very specific muscles. Squats are good, but there are far better exercises for butt. Also, you can have the strongest gluts in the world, but if they're hidden under a layer of fat (and cellulite), nobody will see them.

There is pretty good info about the ANA test it at this link:  http://www.labtestsonline.org/understand...    Conventional doctors tend to deal with the symptoms but don't address the cause. I recommend to see a naturopathic doctor, they focus on eliminating the cause, rather than just masking the symptoms.  Best of luck!|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I would worry more about the onset of Arthritis or rheumatism. This is what it sounds like, if so, there isn't much you can do about it.

This is a natural body producing paine reliever and healer.

t0jC2o0Jaa	Well honestly it just depends on the guy I would think. They come in all shapes and sizes, and thickness. Don't expect anything dramatic, unless there's something to be dramatic about. Some are bigger than others. When I was in high school, guys used to flash girls all the time. Some weren't very appealing, but that could have been because they were being "boys" then. And, I'm sure many have heard, it's not the size that matters.. it's how you use it. Than can be proven true and false. Just really depends on the guy. Which I don't think if for the right reasons for having sex, that the penis size would matter. Remember to have him wear a condom. And, if possible you can get a female condom to wear too. No need for any outcome your not ready for yet, if your not. Good Luck with uh.. "it" and um.. yeah, always protect yourself. I would try to talk you out of it, but only you know when your ready. I am not the judge of it. Just always stay safe, and NEVER, EVER, EVER, let him go without a condom because he "loves you or he's your best friend." If that's true, he'll know it's best to protect BOTH of you.|`|91AMtKEraa	when i was 16 i was 7 half inches but thats me only all guys different  are you scared of the size haha|`|vzBrloF2aa	Hopefully not small haha!|`|8pw8qDjPaa	ahh... they vary. he could be small or large. try asking him, not us.     and rethink having sex, you dont sound quite ready.|`|AA10090215	honestly it really depends on the guy  why do you just ask him?|`|r0HYuHubaa	by the sounds of it...i dont think u should have sex - in the off chance u get pregnant...that wud be bad for us all|`|SslUWT0Jaa	if your worried about it not fitting, try using your fingers to stretch it out every so often, until you think he could fit.|`|kgBQF4JXaa	it's individual, i just know my size, e-mail me if you want to know or see|`|YMdTPNhlaa	Hey it will be near to 3 to 5 inches it varies but he can give good sex don't worry

ocnLnB01aa	Get off the scale and go off the way your clothes fit. Do cardio, and weights and drink alot of water at least a gallon a day, stay off caffeine, watch your diet and your gonna look terrific|`|ype5N1qEaa	You already got the basics- eat healthy, i.e. balanced foods.  Your metabolism will boost if you eat smaller portions more often.  For example, if you normally eat a bowl of cereal, a piece of fruit, and a yogurt for breakfast at 8am, then a sandwich, some soup and a salad at noon, and chicken potatoes and broccoli for dinner at 6, break it up a bit.  Have the cereal around 8.  In another hour or so, eat your yogurt.  An hour after that, eat your fruit.  Then at 11 (an hour after the fruit) eat your salad.  An hour later, eat your sandwich.  You can eat your soup around 2 (two hours later) to hold you over till an early pre dinner snack at five- maybe some carrots with ranch or something.  Eat the same dinner, but smaller portions, and maybe have another small snack (yogurt?) before turning in for the night to keep you satisfied until breakfast.  Your metabolism is kinda like a car.  If you are sitting at stop lights all the time, stopping and going, starting up and slowing down, you waste gas (energy) and therefore end up eating more than you really need.  If you keep your metabolism constantly working (like going straight through on a freeway) you get better gas mileage and your metabolism burns your food more efficiently.    Also, if you are planning on "dieting", eating healthier etc.  Don't  deprive yourself of your favorite foods.  If anything, be sure you eat them.  If you are a chocolate lover and find yourself tempted to devour a full snickers bar every few days, there is a better way to soothe your cravings.  Buy a bag of hershey miniatures.  Tell yourself you can have 1 or 2 a day, and make sure you eat your 2 every day.  If you know you get chocolate every day, then you won't give your body an excuse to crave it, and then tempt yourself to 'binge'    Make sure you drink liquids before you eat.  Most of the time when we think we are hungry, we are really just thirsty.  Try to limit your liquids to water and milk for the most part.    and obviously, exercise.     good luck!|`|WNSG3RNoaa	Going on a strict low calorie, low carb should do the trick, with exercise of course.. Everyone is different, so good luck|`|FJpPCVTCaa	carbohydrate calories are converted by the body into storable fat, so reduce your carbohydrates.  moderate amounts of protein so you don't offset your body's acidity.  try to use fats to control your hunger cravings because most fats you eat from foods rarely get stored in your body. coconut oil, olive oils, avocado, nuts and seeds. avoid cottonseed, canola and corn oils and especially cooking with low grade oils that convert into transfats.  low calorie diets rarely work  alkaline diets are quite effective  most meal replacements will do more harm to your body  colon cleansing can reduce weight you can't remove with most diets and exercises  aerobic exercises are good for reducing body fat  having a healthy level of muscle increases metabolism and fat reduction  undergroundwellness.com and drfuhrman.com are two good sites for information on the most effective permanent ways to lose weight.  you can also youtube undergroundwellness and joel fuhrman for videos on weight loss. very exciting and informative stuff; and good luck :3

UUlY8UOGaa	Arghh i hate pimples to so... hi-5! Lol anyways one thing that really helped me in removing pimples is by swimming. I noticed when i go swimming everyday my face feels alot smoother and the pimple seems to disapear (maybe the chlorine in the pool removes the oil on your face? That's what im guessing) but you would really see the effect after 3~7 days. Washing your face daily helps to but i assume you do that anyway.|`|69SHxWA9aa	Hi,  Make friends with more vegetables, and less animal fats, no cheese, reduce milk consumption, and increase the amount of water that you drink.    All of these things will help got rid of the pimples.  Washing the face frequently with just plain water will also help get rid of some of the oil in your skin.  So will soaking about 15 - 20 minutes in a warm and soapy tub.  You should be soaking in a tub for about 1 minutes once or twice a week, it is good for you.

t0jC2o0Jaa	You should be getting a pap regardless of birth control. It's very important to get a pap done yearly to check for infection, diseases, cancers etc. They don't hurt, and if they do, it's only for a short time, and it's over. It's very important! You'll be surprised how many women wished they got one and found out they should have gotten one sooner.  It's not always comfortable to lay there while someone does the routine, but it only takes minutes out of your day and it's over until your next visit. It's nothing to worry about. Just re-think it! Birth control is actually a pretty smart thing to get on. Besides the fact your sexually active, it helps with cramps, irregular period, mood swings, and much more. :-) I'd advise you get it done and over with! :)|`|Cx327Rotaa	And why would you think you wont have a period if your on birth control?  Sorry that wont happen , periods come anyways it will come when you least expect it even if it is three months later.

And to the pap, yes they suck but they are good to have done anyways even though.  It is a preventative.  Get used to it now.  Because as a rule once a year you should get one.|`|fAcVndo7aa	Yes, you will need to have a full exam before any reputable doctor will prescribe you birth control pills.  You also can expect them to order a pregnancy test, just to be sure.    The exam is short and shouldn't be painful.  It may be uncomfortable, but not painful.  It's important to establish that you are in good health before starting you on the pills.  You should be sure to tell your doctor about your sexual experiences, so they can effectively evaluate your results.  If you don't want your mom to know, you don't have to have her in the room with you.|`|AA11156937	It's good to get one but not necessarily.  You could just get the birth control without the pap smear.|`|y9nx4jt6aa	As soon as you become sexual active and as long as you remain sexually active you're supposed to get a pap once every year.

8QrfXxaXaa	Hi,    It looks like a bad bout of cold. Please make sure to keep an eye on the temperature as the possibility of upper respiratory tract infection is also there.  Meanwhile take OTC medications for cough and headaches. Drink plenty of warm fluids like soup etc.   It will help us know if it is a wet cough or a dry one. Dry cough occurs mostly due to allergies. The chances are more if you have a positive history of allergies.  A clinical exam of chest and throat by your GP will also help.    Regards,  Noopur|`|IMENWksEaa	The wheezing and coughing might be a respiratory infection. Scroll down this page where it gets into mold, fungus infections. Even if this is just a cold, the article material is helpful to know about, especially if phlegm or mucus becomes an issue, or a persistent cough that won't go away. Check this out with a doctor too.
CciXZNYraa	Here are some "indoor" exercises you can do;    Sit ups: Please note that sit-ups can be a strenuous activity on the lower back. Understanding how to get a six pack and not damage yourself in the process is critical. Do not strain yourself; build up this type of exercise slowly. Twisting during this exercise (left elbow to right knee) is NOT effective and put the lower back under tremendous stress. If you feel even the slightest twinge, then stop.   In order to strengthen your abs, care and technique are necessary. Effective sit-ups need to pull the torso towards the knees from a lying position only using the abdominal group of muscles. If you have your legs straight on the floor then more powerful muscles in the legs will do most of the work.  To counteract this you should bend your knees while sitting up and so make the abdominal muscles feel the burn. If you gather a momentum you will not be working the muscles effectively. Only by slowly raising and lowering will you achieve the best results.     Leg lifts: The challenge with this exercise is to keep your legs straight and not to let your feet touch the floor.   Lie of the floor with your hands by your sides. Keeping your legs straight lift them to 90 Degree and back down but to do allow then to touch the ground, repeat back to the 90 degrees position.     Jacknife Sit-ups: Discover how to get a six pack the hard way with this intense workout.  Start as you would in the position to do sit-ups with your hands at your sides.   Without bending your knees, simultaneously lift you legs in the air and your head and shoulder so that your whole body makes a V-shape. If you can manage it the try to touch your toes.   Then relax and go back to the starting position.     V-ups: This exercise requires good balance and strong core muscles. It can be performed on a bench but can also be carried out on a mat on the floor(but don't let those legs touch the floor).  Bending your knees, simultaneously lift your legs and your torso so they form a V as you can see from the photo. Then go back to the relax position, during this exercise you arms should remain horizontal.    The Static hold: Get into the push-up position but with your forearms touching the ground. Make sure your body is a straight line from your shoulders down to your toes and hold that position for a minimum of 1 minute.   This exercise strengthen your core abdominal muscles. Repeat this exercise more and more as you strengthen the core muscles.|`|07vq1Y8iaa	lots of cardio  sprinting   weights  and good diet  goodluck  http://www.yoursuperbody.com|`|gR260etdaa	abs dont look nice on girls|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Push-ups, dips and sit-ups are a start, you can jog in place too or follow the steps in an aerobics video.|`|SslUWT0Jaa	I use my 12 pound pomeranian as a weight.

I cant believe that people out there feel it necessary to slam those that are asking for help...that is why people do not ask for help...No, they can not disclose your disorder.  They may however ask you about it, and it is completely up to you what you say about it.  If you end up trusting your doc, this may be a great opportunity to find some help when you are ready.      It is even more necessary that you have proper dental care with this disorder and if you feel ashamed then find another dentist.  It is their job to care for their patients, which is why they may ask about it, however, it is essential that they keep things confidential and not pass judgement to you, they are there to help you.    If you do share this with them as well as your feelings to wait to seek help, they could give you some helpful tips to help care for your teeth and keep them as healthy as possible until you are ready to trust someone to help you.

I to have horrible teeth and have no enamel on them and have had numerous cavities because of all the health problems, including but not limited to the Anorexia.  The dentist may ask like they always ask me do you drink caffeine, juices, and stuff like that.  They may ask about the vomiting, but really unlikely.  If they do it's your chose to tell them and a side bar all medical professionals are ethically bound to uphold the law, which means that they have to report certain things but certain things are left up to the patients discretion.  Don't be a coward/victim be a survivor.  If you feel the need to talk to someone about how to tell someone you can always contact me.  I don't mind helping people out since I've been in many people shoes with certain situations.|`|I8C1vJ23aa	Yes, the dentist will have  a good idea that you are bulimic because the erosion will be mostly behind your teeth where the vomit hits them on the way out.    They are highly unlikely to ask directly if you are bulimic,but may ask if you drink alot of fruit juice/fizzy drinks.    They will not report you to anyone.    x
aIHSmRYwaa	I think it's a great idea. The websites are a positive supportive way to help those like me!!|`|u7JI8O4eaa	I think it's bad. food is necessary.|`|N9nJWYa5aa	I've been anorexic, please let your friends and family know how you feel and seek counseling.|`|qpt51YeAaa	it would be a good idea if it was what it said it was.  sure, SOME of the girls on there suffer from real eating disorders  but 90% of the bitches on there are just looking for advice on how to eat less and less each day  and in three months when they lose forty pounds, they'll get weird looks from friends, family, and strangers and eat again  and they may or may not gaint he weight back, because that fake proana bullshit thinking stays with you for a long time.  it encourages girls to lose weight, it doesnt help them feel better.  they should be banned|`|uqRb9tAqaa	It's disgusting. It's encouraging young girls to starve themselves, hate their bodies, lie to their parents, teachers, and doctors, destroy their lives, risk serious diseases... it's horrible. Absolutely horrible. Anorexia is NOT a lifestyle. It is a sick, sad, mental and physical disease that should never be encouraged, or praised. It doesn't take will-power or self control to starve yourself - being sick DOESN'T mean you are strong. Being strong is accepting and loving yourself for who you are, and not buying into the media bull sh*t that encourages women to be stick thin rails, instead of accepting themselves as real people and not obsessing over a number on the scale.    My sister died from anorexia/bulimia related causes. It's never okay, it should never be encouraged, it should be accepted.    It kills.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	It's a gimmick.|`|JQJvW4KSaa	The one think I can say surely about pro-ana is that it's very controversial.    One the against side I would say that it could encourage people to 'become anorexic' this is in fact incorrect. Anorexia is a mental illness and looking at pro-ana websites cannot make someone anorexic.    Also, in my mind, there are two types of pro-ana. There's the type that makes anorexia seem fashionable, and a very grown up sort.    I'll start with my opinion of the first sort.  I say it makes it seem fashionable because it usually has the too much of the rules and pictures and not enough of the common sense, this in my views is the most dangerous sort. Although, I stand firm in my view it can't affect someone who is not anorexic. But it is indeed dangerous to those who are anorexic.    Then, I call the other sort the grown up sort because it deals with the facts of anorexia.  Many of the grown up anorexia contain disclaimers than they do indeed recognise it is an illness and not a diet.    I think that it's controversial without needing to be. Yes, anorexia is a deadly illness, but pro-ana websites do NOT cause the illness.    Many of the "sensible" pro-ana websites seem to be more than people think, more of a refuge for people suffering with the illness to talk about it openly and freely and to allow their thoughts to be aired without having to censor it.    In a whole, I do think that certain pro-ana is dreadful, but I also think that people need a place to turn to when they feel they have no where else to go.     But I don't know if you meant just pro-ana photos or pro-ana websites.    I once saw a website called Not Otherwise Specified which rather than showing extremely thin girls it showed "healthy pro-ana".    I am against it, but I don't think that the sensible ones should be taken off-line, that in my mind would be like not allowing the Samaritans to run a website or phone-line.
AA11194223	same here love them contacts.But,,, wear your glasses in between time so your eyes can get a rest.Also do not clean ur lens in the same thing as u  rinse them.I use wallgreens brand not as much money as the others and just as good thats why once u start stick with the same brand so ur eyes will get use to that brand.Use only the one for storeing and cleaning.Then use the saline rince to rince them before you put them on in the mornings NEVER sleep w/them.And ALWAYS use REWETTING DROPS before u put and after  Thats why ur eyes feel dry.Ive been useing (Sensitive Eyes )Baush/Lomb a little more money than the others i try to get the larger size that way it last longer :-)  good luck ps Wash hands before inserting/removing|`|KAyVeRezaa	The contact solution that you use for cleaning can also be used for moistening your eyes.|`|zLGOQQs5aa	eye drops duh!|`|q0QYDtH7aa	just means your eyes are dry. Get some drops and you will be fine. In fact our lens solution may have come with some.|`|4rRQfIihaa	i wear contacts myself,  and i use one'a'days,  they are every day disposable contacts.  they work like a charm!  the best thing ever!  and my eyes dont dry out.|`|sLGlL17naa	Get soft contact lenses. Make sure you get the ones where you take them out every night and put them into solution. Get the ones where you dispose of them every month.    My eyes never feel dry because of this plan.
RbmVnoozaa	yeah it looks legit.  just make sure you dont add any sugar so you can reap all the benefits of the anti-oxidants.  dont forget diet and exercise though.  trying starting out 1-2 cups a day your first week.  then 3-5 after that.
F17bGTAOaa	No lol here.  Get it x-rayed.  You can break a small bone in your foot without a ton of pain and may be able to walk on it.  The problem is that if a break cuts blood vessels it is possible to lose blood supply to a bone - thus the bone can die.  Not a good option - just get it x-rayed and be on top of your health.|`|rw5N5rcKaa	First of all I am not a doctor.   (don't be confused by my yahoo name).    You probably injured your foot in the fall.        I would suggest having it examined by a foot doctor.    Update:   The possibility of a doctor saying that nothing is wrong shouldn't be a reason not to go to the doctor.   If you are examined, and nothing is wrong, that's a good thing, isn't it?   So instead of going to a doctor, you will believe what you consider to be the best answer on Yahoo?  lol|`|sTN1ApTFaa	Go to the doctors
cMrxyWQ0aa	you could just be out of shape. That happens to me too.    Don't worry I'm NOT calling you fat, you could be skinny and out of shape too.
Rk46lIBwaa	I am afraid I know the feeling, I have been a regular gym attender, 5 days a week for 10 years, and after some early loses I have lost very little additional weight.    The body is extremely clever and tries to maintain the status quo, attempting to keep the weight constant under varying circumstances.    You may have to increase exercise to get things kick started, I don't suggest any further calorie reduction if you want to maintain good health and to be frank take in enough calories to allow you to exercise.    On the plus side, there is little doubt your regime will mean that you are very fit and healthy.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	You are definitely working out quite a lot. How much do you weigh now? It's entirely possible you are already a good healthy weight. Muscle weighs more than fat, that's why just weighing yourself isn't always a good way to judge your fitness. It's also important to make sure you're eating the correct kinds of food. Calorie counting alone won't help if all the calories are made up of the unhealthy kind. Ask your doctor for some nutrition advice. :-)|`|12MNsMQFaa	There's a calorie counter on my treadmill and it says that I lose 350 calories in 30 minutes (I adjust the speed so it will be more challenging as I run) but I'm not sure if it's accurate. I treadmill to keep my fitness up, not to lose weight and it seems to be working. Well let's say that my treadmill is accurate, then I don't think your 45 mintues of exercise is intense enough to lose a lot of weight.  Aerobic exercises are good but interval training is even better for weight/fat loss. Remember, you must also do weight training when trying to lose weight because you need muscle in order to boost your metabolism.    I hope that helps. Good luck!|`|kHEFi3ttaa	Yes there is. Your metabolism might be irregular. My fianc, who is also 24, as an unusually slow metabolism. He now has to go on medication and exercise to be able to lose weight. He'd been trying for over a year and seeing little no result. Now that his Doc has figured out the problem he's lost over 50lbs, not saying you need to do this but I'm saying get checked out because if you do have a problem you need to address it now while you're young.    Good Luck|`|dBoC8fR2aa	As long as you can maintain your weight you should be grateful for not gaining anymore weights. Our body is such that after a while on one type of exercise, it doesn't lose weight anymore. Therefore you need to change to different types always.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You've probably built up muscle, which is heavier than fat, so your jeans are probably a fair bit looser than they were a few years ago.    You might like to vary the exercise regime, and add yoga or pilates to work other muscles, and to work your very trained muscles in a different way.     Get the blood test done because there may be something with your blood sugar you need to have checked out.|`|KJLFVjoraa	Don't see how you can tone down effort level and increase calorific burn that doesn't make sense. Have you measured your body fat ? You may have been adding muscle in place of fat (muscle is heavier). To burn fat you are best doing a lot of low intensity (i.e. several hours a day) rather than an intense 45 minute workout.|`|LrYcvGgiaa	If you've been exercising intensely and dieting for a YEAR with no results you should definitely have a blood test done.  There could be issues with your body that are making it hard for you to lose weight.|`|ZoajuFv1aa	Welllll your intake of calories is more than you burn so it will take longer but surely you will loose the weight.|`|o1Lq2eikaa	its really frustrating. blood test is for ur liver test and thyroid gland test. he is trying to get measure for ur metabolic rate.     its difficult to break ur stuburn fats. once u succeed then things are going to be well.
UDV6XDUpaa	The best thing for you to do would to get health insurance as you seem to get ill a lot. Have you considered seeing a natropath or dietitian? Perhaps by eating the correct foods with vitamin and minerals you can boost your immune system. Blood work may also be beneficial to see if you have any underlying conditions that could cause your illness'   Best of luck|`|yJQpxV75aa	A doctor.|`|hqxnCZzzaa	well , i personally think youre doctors are full of bs  go out of state to a good one that can actually treat and heal it  they will also answer youre questions    local doctors are not good sources
dMknJjY0aa	that really sucks. I am have a growth spurt at 21 CRAZY!!!|`|9pLdhuBnaa	I have always known PCOS to be a hormone imbalance (I was diagnosed with it 12 years ago).    There is an organization that is trying to make women aware of PCOS and offers all kinds of information on the subject.  To find out more please check out: http://www.pcosupport.org|`|AA12385489	Yes, I have always been the same way.  I was not diagnosed until 1993 because PCOS did not exist.    Not everyone who has PCOS shows all of the symptoms.    I have never had diabetes.    I was on the pill from January 1993 through December 2007.
RYDwwTITaa	Yes it does. That way it protects the recipients from dangerous illness such as aids. And if it test positive, then the blood will be destroyed, and the donor will be notified that they are indeed positive for whatever the illness may be.    But please don't go and donate blood as a way to get your blood tested. This is the wrong way about it. Just go to a clinic if you're worried you may be positive for HIV or what not.|`|kdSuwt8paa	Yes.|`|oKvyaIPSaa	Yes and it is a routine thing that is done when donating blood.|`|s1gEHdBgaa	Yes, of course!|`|eBRkh2HLaa	Yes it does. They usually ask you a ton of interview questions first as well to see if you fit into a category that may be at a higher risk for aides.|`|CfcS92bGaa	It does get tested and they will throw out any blood that they believe is infected.  A health official will then contact you so that you can go to the health center for testing.  Sometimes it is nothing, and sometimes they find the person does have an STD.|`|wpO1GNMLaa	not always, i was watching the news about something like this today, this guy donated blood and he was a carrier of aids, and the person who got his blood actually caught aids and is in the process of suing the hospital and the man, so whoever told you they always check, is lying|`|ub23m7Praa	Yes. They have to test it on top of having you sign the sheet saying you don't have it. If you do and know you do and they find it you can go to jail.|`|OOL4XdjPaa	by law.    they didn't a long time ago...    and some people got like hepetits from it and other crap    so now they have to.
foMaAyTWaa	You should probably go back to the doctor just in case, especially since the injury was pretty recent.
RWt78jE5aa	Floss first brush after. Flossing helps for cavities and plaque. Studies show that listerine actually stains your teeth ( don't believe me look it up ) . And crest white strips is suppose to bleach your teeth.|`|OBA3Iciraa	I like to floss before that way when I brush, I know it's getting all the plaque out and i feel cleaner too.  Listerine will not whiten your teeth, but, crest white strips do.  Flossing really helps alot! Plaque hides in between teeth that brushing just can't get at.|`|TORBP6QIaa	Floss first..brush next, rinse last...    Flossing has made a huge difference to my dental health...my dentist always commets on how clean my teeth are when I go for a checkup...I never used to get those commens before I began to floss.      Try this...brush your teeth really really well...then floss and see all the muck that you get out...Thats often the stuff that causes cavities and it is also the plaque that the dentist scrapes off your teeth at a "cleaning".  That stuff is why flossing is so good for dental health.|`|N2cXDFfXaa	My dentist tells me to floss first, because the flossing dislodges decaying food matter and bacteria that's stuck between your teeth.     Obviously some of it's going to remain inside your mouth so it's a good idea to brush second to get rid of it.|`|rLJ80mZZaa	Your supposed to floss first then brush. Yes flossing helps a lottttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt believe me. I'm at the dentists office 24/7 lol   Every dentists office I've gone to they've made me rinse my mouth with listerine so I doubt its bad. As for crest white strips, don't overdo them.
KppM3VzAaa	Get your weight in kgs. Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).    Then eat the right amount of protein, reduce your calorie intake 500 below your RMR and research shows you will lose 2lbs of FAT per week.    Best to eat 4 - 6 small meals per day.    Exercise wise, you need to do 3 20 mins sessions per week. Choose your machine, running, rowing etc. Do 5 mins at a gentle pace, then up your pace each minute for the next 4 mins, repeat this cylce. Then the last 2 mins the gentle pace to warm down.    Combine these you'll burn fat.     hope that helps|`|gR260etdaa	exercise, do cardio workouts like running or swimming|`|1eKiTA6qaa	yoga...it helps a lot to make ur tummy flat. nothing works better than that. you have to do it early in the morning i.e. before breakfast to have max effects!

I think the worst part is that everyone feels so distant, and the best way to fix that problem is do something with your friends that will totally bring you guys together.

Just pick your most awesome scenario and make it happen.|`|4AwWgUhqaa	Hi     Being 17 is a real pain in the ***. Try to enjoy time at school even though you are mixed in with lots of people that aren't like you at all. Sometimes mixing with so many different types of people makes us feel a bit off the air.     Take some time out for yourself each day.     Dont worry about the stress your Dad is displaying.     May be a chat with someone at school like a counsellor would help for you to talk about your life. I wouldn't mention your Dad as there is a risk that your family may come under review of the school.     Best of luck and hang in there. 12 is a bit young to loose your Mum.     My brother 13 and other brother 15 lost their Mum as did I. I was lucky to be 23. They are now both very well adjusted great guys. One is a cartoonist and the other is a nurse who is top of his field. So dont feel that living in a different living arrangement will have any impact on you.     Your friends parents (Mums) are likely to be a great resource to have that feminine touch in your life.

TORBP6QIaa	Rest, rest and more rest...keep off the bad leg and get some crutches...a shot of cortisone into the tendon will also aid healing. Elevate and ice the injury.    I am assuming it has not healed because you have been using the leg as normal...some total rest of it should see a quick improvement.|`|2acc3a7c0b86e1730fe9b78eddb8365baa	You could try using an air cast. You can buy them over the counter at your pharmacist. or try wraping it with an ace bandage. Apply ice on it a few times a day and keep it elevated when you are resting. You can take ibuprofen for the pain if you can tolerate that.Ibuprofen also cuts down the swelling. Good luck...Good Luck..
fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	Halls cough drops are not made to cure a sore throat of any kind.  They merely ease the pain some by coating the throat.   You don't know if you have strep throat unless you go to the Dr and have a swab done.    No throat lozenges cure the sore throat.  You must go to the Dr.|`|bfb88160853edd441f13c069712a5c16aa	If you want a pain reliever, I would say that advil or tylenol would be the best.  If you want a topical pain reliever, you would be better off looking at cepicol or chloraseptic  lozenges, they have Benzocaine/Menthol and are called an oral Anesthetic.    For me, halls doesn't work at all.  I guess because it has menthol in it, it might help a little but with strep throat, you sur don't want it if it just helps a little.  Take Advil or Tylenol to make it through the day.    That said, do you know what could happen with an untreated strep throat?  Look up Rheumatic Fever, and Glomerulonephritis.|`|zzPy8s9baa	They have a new halls that taste like peach and inside is honey, it helps soothe the throat. U can also suck on hard candy like jolly ranchers.    Ginger root tea works wonders.|`|WnRJFIAoaa	You can use cepacol drops that numbs the throat, but to solve the soreness, gargarize with yellow listerine. Keep it until you can't stand it, longest possible, and make different loises while gargarizing, it'll get everywhere. I've never believed it worked until I tried it and now at slightest sign of a sore throat, a use yellow listerine and the next day it's gone.
ruamFLoiaa	You don't have any symptoms later in the day?  Could it be that you are allergic to something in your bedroom?  If you actually do have the cough all day, you may have a secondary infection and need an antibiotic.

It could be many thing plus it's flu season. Good Luck|`|0267b4b30705032220d53177414ef86aaa	You should just walk into a clinic and find out. It might be an obstruction in your throat, it might be swollen glands. Only a doctor would know for sure.  My wife had an obstruction grow in her throat. The doctor told her it was because she became hoarse, and instead of trying to reduce the inflammation, my wife attended a Karoake party instead, and caused her throat to react. He said that a growth of that nature is from vocal abuse. Singers get it a LOT, and he scolded her for singing when she knew she was hoarse. He used a numbing agent, and a needle to kill the growth, and my wife was back to normal in a few days time.   I don't know that THIS is your problem, but the point I'm making is that my wife would have NEVER have guessed what it was. Only a doctor could correctly diagnose it.   You should probably see a doctor.   Peace!|`|8QrfXxaXaa	Hi,    Acid reflux or GERD gastro esophageal reflux disease can cause cough in the early morning along with breathlessness. Chances are more if there is a positive history of acid reflux.  Please make sure that you eat your dinner at least 2 hrs before bedtime and keep your head elevated on a pillow while sleeping. OTC antacids will also help.  Other possibility is allergies which needs to be ruled out.  I would suggest you to get a clinical evaluation done by your GP for correct diagnosis.

An3TLXUSaa	Ok first of all you need to change your eating habit. 5-6 small meals a day if you can other wise portion size my dear. Cut out carbs, fat and sodium. you shouldn't consume more than 90 grams of carbs per meal at 3 meals a day, unless you are diabetic and it would be 4 carbs = 60 grams per meal. at 3 meals a day. 1600 calories daily and 1000 mg of sodium. try sodium part is quite hard but it helps keep the bloating around the tummy down. Cutting out soda is a plus especially for the bloating area and wasted carbs. try drinking flavored water if you cant just drink plain water. starting off with a body detox cleanser is something to think about also. You can check with your doctor to see a nutritionist it is usually covered by your insurance but most of the time it is a free service to you.|`|KppM3VzAaa	Y9our going to struggle doing what you are doing. Popcorn for breakfast is not good and one meal per day with around 1200 cals is not sensible either.    Popcorn has simple carbs (sugar)  All tha does to your body is send it into  chaos, storing sugar as fat.  You may lose weight it will be muscle, slowing your metabollic rate meaning you'll pile it back on again.    Here's what I recomend    Get your weight in kgs. Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).

Mostly I would be concerned with getting rid of the cough, since heat rises  it will be colder on the floor, try to elevate your bed.  Aslong as the fan is not blowing on you that shouldn't be a problem, but dry air might be, try a humidifier to put more moisture back in the air.  Just in case you are catching a cold, eat fresh garlic it will help your immune system fight off the cold.  Take thinly sliced fresh garlic and put it on bread with a little mayo to help with the taste, use a whole clove and try to do this twice a day.  It really helps, but if the cold gets the best of you, you will need to see a doctor.  Good Luck
AA12266052	Hirsutism is the excessive growth of thick or dark hair in women in locations that are more typical of male hair patterns (eg, mustache, beard, central chest, shoulders, lower abdomen, back, inner thigh). The amount of hair growth that is considered excessive may differ depending on ethnic background and cultural interpretation.|`|nKwcGLQraa	maybe you are an XXY instead of an XX. or is that the same this as PCOS (dont raally know what that is...)?|`|2L3MXZMTaa	Sounds like your hormones are out of whack. I'm no doctor, but I haven't been right since I had my first daughter. Acne for the first time, mood swings, crazy pms, stuff I had never experienced before. I started taking birth control pills and they helped greatly. Then I started having problems w/ yeast and also my digestion bc of the pills, so then I got on the shot. I don't have periods and all the other symptoms are gone, the only thing is that after being on those types of contraceptives it can take months or even years to become fertile again once you're ready to have kids
YBcB0732aa	I had 4  wisdom teeth(3 were impacted)) removed while under IV sedation at the oral surgeon office.|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	Absolutely...but IV sedation is called general. It means you are put to sleep. Do you mean local? Where they just numb your mouth? Some people can't be put "out" so they have to do it that way. Talk to the oral surgeon and if you are not comfortable with being put under then there will be other options. It may take longer and cause you more discomfort but you have the final say-so.|`|1hciyvKdaa	In the US, the oral surgeon has all the options of anethesia at their disposal in thier office. If your going to pay for general all work will be done at once, or you should ask if it can be, why pay for two visits you mise well recover with one tme in thier office, thats my opionion anyhow. When I had General an anethisiologist administered it, and took care of me during my surgery and spoke to me post care. I had IV once, I went totally under as far as I am concerned, I do not know how many people were in the room, I never asked since my Ins paid for it.  Make sure the tell you completely about your options and go with what the Dr recommends he knows how intrusive the surgery is. Read this link below, go down to the person saying they are an anethisiaologist. He may or may not be, but he has some info at the bottom of his post to me, might be good to at least ask.|`|mAp90hEeaa	This depends on the comfort level of your oral surgeon.

PEw6Z3mEaa	In testing to see if someone has recently used pot, there are two important substances to keep in mind: THC and 9-carboxy-THC. 9-carboxy-THC is a product of the body's metabolism of THC and, more importantly, it is detectable for a longer period of time than THC is detectable. This is the reason that drug tests, namely urine tests, look for 9-carboxy-THC.

iWrOmQemaa	I'm just 19, and I suffer from the same thing.  I completely agree with the person above me however, stretching is key.  When I stretch my pain/discomfort is lowered.  I would also recommend weight lifting to strengthen the muscles in your neck/shoulders/back.  It would be best to start off with just some basic exercises, low weights, with a high amount of sets.  If you are really in that much pain I would also recommend seeing your general practitionerner and have him/her refer you to a physical therapist if your insurance covers one.  He/she can teach you the proper stretches and exercises to do and assist you with them, it is usually covered by insurance as well.  Also if you find out or already know if it is joint related take glucosamine chondrotine.

Lots of pain from him, and no real resolution to my problems......  I luckily found a book called "Treat your own back" by Robin McKenzie. I'm not even finished reading the book, and it has already helped me. It tells you a lot of things that people do to mess up their backs, then tells you how to avoid or correct it ! (He even has a book about how to "treat your own neck" that I hope to be able to track down.) It's a short, easy to understand book, and I feel like it could make a world of difference ! I sure hope this helps you as much as it has me, and I wish you the best of luck !!!!|`|AA11614449	I would suggest a massage therapist, after several sessions there's usually an improvement.  Not only does it help release tension in the muscles it can help you to relax mentally.      My friend is a massage therapist and met a woman in the seat next to her with bad arthritis in the hands and she offered to massage it.  The woman was so impressed that she felt so much relief after the plane trip.    It wouldn't hurt to try    Oh yeah also some massage therapist work though insurance so you might be compensated for your cost.|`|YX93lq4daa	I suggest an organic rub with emu oil or Herbal Vapors/Injur Heal Balm from mountain rose herbs.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	You are right  - you are on a course to far more problems if you don't take care of it now!  You may also have a fibromalgia component.  Chiropractors are just like any other profession - there are some better and some worse, and some in it for the patients but others in it for the money.  I think no chiropractor should book more than 8-12 visits - there are many that try to start with 30 or more!  That is not taught in the schools but in get-rich marketing classes which I think should be made illegal.|`|vYVkf2Eraa	You are getting a lot of good information here, I would like to just add one more thought.     The incidence of arthritis has steadily risen since the early 1900's when processed foods, such as packaged crackers, cereals, bread and snack foods, began to dominate the American diet-and more people started to become obese. Most of these foods actually promote inflammation, which can cause joint and cartilage damage and aggravate arthritis pain.    Most Americans get far too many omega-6 fatty acids (inflammatory -promoting) in their diets. A century ago the ratio of omega-6 to omega 3 fatty acids was 2:1 Today it is about 20:1 This imbalance boost levels of a chemical by-product arachidonic acid, that triggers inflammation.    Because omega-6 are found in red meats, commercially processed foods and fast foods, anyone with arthritis should avoid these foods as much as possible.    Supplement your diet with fish oil, or blue green algae (Chlorella, Spirulina, AFA).    Ginger, taken twice a day is effective at controlling arthritis pain. It is a blood thinner so consult your doctor if you are taking blood thinning medication.|`|AA10744471	My handsome husband who is a diabetic and  arthritic has also a very bad back and is suffering from back pain. He has been diagnosed as suffering from spondylosis, diabetic neuropathy, slipped disc, spinal stenosis and other exotic names for this arthritic back pain. Since he is brave, he does not mind the pain, but he is a coward when it comes to surgery because he is afraid of being confined to a wheelchair if the surgery goes haywire. So, he has tried so many remedies, from conventional painkillers to alternative herbal and mechanical devices. Right now, he is saying that the relief he is getting is from using the devices being sold by Sacro Wedgy of the US, the modified Dorn Method as espoused by Dr. Thomas Zudrell of Germany, and the Korean massage device called the Ceragem and others such devices.   This is not to endorse these products, but I am only saying that my handsome husband has practically tried most of them. Good luck to you.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	Please consider a different chiropractor.

However, based on my own personal experience with sciatica and lower back pain, I suggest seeing a physical therapist. First, see an MD possibly to get x-rays and to rule out any medical disorder.    I hope you have the insurance to cover this. Ask your MD for a referral to a physical therapist. A good PT can use heat packs, ice packs, ultrasound and massage. Perhaps most importantly, they can show you exercises tailored to your specific physical needs. This is better than looking through books or going to classes to find out what works or does not work for you.    Most of the PT exercises can be done on a daily basis at home. For some exercises, you may need equipment at a local health club. Then there a few exercise that need equipment only provided at a PT office.     I have also had negative or neutral experiences with chiropractors. I found PT to be far more valuable, but don't forget a checkup with an MD.|`|m38IqHKaaa	you need to stretch the muscles and joints and i reccomend fish oil to assist in your joints.  do pilates, really it is fantastic as you are too young to suffer from chronic back pain|`|RkBlMyHRaa	Have you gone to a serious Physician that can diagnose hip and back displacement?

There are a lot of kids like you.  You're forced to go to school and listen to adults who love the sound of their own boring voices, so when you come home you don't want more enforced work.  Later when you've relaxed and done your own thing for a while, and have your second wind, you're able to tackle it.  TV helps because it's something you like as opposed to enforced work.  There are many people like you, successful ones too.  I met a writer in her twenties who has many books for young girls in stores, and she said she always writes with the TV on.   Also, many people like deadlines because they help them focus and accomplish things.|`|3c69b107d5ca339c6b1746ad0f2379f4aa	Seems very normal ...nothing to worry about .

XTfr3uKQaa	Yes that's true, it's cause you're speeding up your metabolism. But this is a good thing and you should be letting yourself get really hungry. If you wait hours before eating your  metabolism will slow down and then it will absorb anything you do eat alot worse, and this can actually make you gain weight cause your body isnt used to processing foods at regular times.|`|jPf2TMgLaa	yes, short answer, it slows down metabolism.  which in long run isnt that good.    just try to eat a little bit of fruit in the morning, this should b a gentle way to break the morning cycle (people who say to eat a big breakfast are idiots) and then maybe a salad or something small for lunch...    then you can have you usual dinner and still not eat so much. :)|`|VR0h4L32aa	because   you speed up ur metabolism when you eat breakfast, if u dont your metabolism is slow from sleeping at night, then extra slow when you dont eat when u wake up, its unhealthy in the end|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	Your body adapts to starvation and does so very quickly.  You wouldn't think that people on the verge of starvation would lose their appetite but they do, and anorexics exploit this reaction.  It isn't a viable weight loss strategy, though.  You don't get hungry; you just get weaker and weaker.
5gnGsqnnaa	Masturbation is a big problem, believe me. Many men fall in addiction to it, as it gives instant gratification and can be used to treat painful emotions (loneliness, boredom, sorrow, lust).    Married men are never shy to say that marriage does not stop the m-train. It's something you have to control for yourself, with or without aid from others. I say this now, because masturbation will grow from simple fantasies in your head to seductive images, then to porn then to really bad stuff, and it can go in many bad directions from there.    Although it's (by worldy standards) considered okay, masturbation is a very destructive habit that can ruin your life, honestly. Imagine your girlfriend catching you looking at pornography, or your boss.     For solutions, I encourage you to seek help from other addicts, and find a good friend that can talk to you and you can share your problem with. Make a goal for yourself to stay away from the habit. Find out what fuels your sex drive, and cut off the source before you can't control yourself and give into temptation.    There are many good guys around on the internet that you can tlak to. Masturbation is a really big problem among men, and has ruined many marriages and lives. Really.    I will pray for you brother! Feel free to message me if you need some support.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	As long as you are healthy - there should be no problems at all.

(if you have settings on it put it on jet or massage)if you have a detachable head for your shower, pull the skin back on your clitoris and let the water run fast straight onto the clitoris... it feels amazing.    Tell your boyfriend what you ust saidthere. tell him you have been going out for 3 months and think its time to at least kiss. Tel him you will take it slowly with him and then just lean n and kiss him. I could be just him because i dont know a guy who doesnt want to kiss but he coul just be shy or worried about stuffing it up. Just go for it and see what he does. he will most likely not pull away.|`|An3TLXUSaa	the period part is normal, masturbation  use your imagination. as for the boyfriend don't' worry about it your too young to keep to one boy or even worry about them they are just into themselves at this age anyways.|`|lBrCM0TWaa	wow. lots of questions.  i will answer  1. u are normal. when u lay down, the blood sometimes does not come out... its "laying down" too, inside the uterus.  after u get up, gravity helps pull it out through the cervix and down to the pad/tampon, that takes time, sometimes even two hours.  but please dont sleep with a tampon.  you should NEVER leave a tampon in overnight. u can get toxic shock syndrome. bad.  just wear a big pad to bed since u dont bleed much overnite apparently anyway. clots are normal. more exercise during the day and lots of water will help thin those out if they are bothersome.|`|Kk44jgk5aa	1. Ewwwww  2. Try a stapler  3. Sum guys act interesed and sum don't when they are  You figure it out|`|DgX8eVJtaa	Everyone else covered the others...  aka  clots are normal, they're just the uterine lining.  boys... well, they're boys. i'm a senior in high school and just broke up with my boyfriend of two years... serious bummer, but we're still the best of friends. remember, even if he doesn't kiss you or if you stop going out, you're not going to lose him. you've known each other for long enough to not have that happen.    as far a masturbation goes, I probably did it that much when I was your age too. it is what it is.   I do agree that it can get boring... but i never liked putting things up there much.   A) Do it less often, or take a break for a week or two. When you start up again it will be excellent.  B) Try just using your hands to touch yourself. You don't need other stuff... the button up top is wayyy more sensitive than putting anything in.  C) ..vibrator... if you are interested in it, try an old electric toothbrush, obviously that you don't use.. make su're you have underwear between though, or you can get raw.    Don't get too far ahead of yourself, but remember also that touching yourself is way better than having sex and getting pregnant.    Cheers :)|`|HEb9nQeFaa	Period - NORMAL!! Its just dried blood. And you dont often get much during the night cos youre not doing anything. If you stayed up all night you'd probably get a bit more. It's normal!!    Masturbation - You could try watching some free adult films and acting out what they do. The people in them know what feels good!    Boyfriend - When you're with him (alone) and he's talking to you. Do the triangle. This is when you look in his eyes and glance at his mouth every few seconds. This tells him you want to kiss him. Either he will make the first move or you will. Just lean in and take it slow rather than tackling him, haha!       Good luck :) xx|`|hZWUI3Shaa	Easy one first:  Your boyfriend is most likely not going to be your boyfriend for the rest of your life. Try and put your life in perspective. But if you are determined to get a kiss from him, why don't you find out why he doesn't want to kiss you and work on them.    When you're on your period and the big chunks come out, they're called clots. It's not really anything to be worried about. I had a bunch of info on why your period pauses while you sleep, but I can't find it now.    You're very young to be masturbating on such a regular basis. Doing it less regularly would make it less boring.
mAp90hEeaa	There is no "best" position.  Her doctor has probably made some recommendations but whatever position is most comfortable is usually what is allowed.
4gfitHMxaa	Well..it depends where you want the break to be. How big of a leg cast do you want? A full leg cast requires a femoral break. You could do this with a sledgehammer. Or a truck running over the upper part of the leg--but be careful not to break the hip bones as well.Those breaks can be nasty to heal. A break lower down, like the knee joint, could be caused by a misplaced horse kick, a fall on the ice, basically anything that could push the joint backwards from its normal position. The shin bones can also be broken with a sledgehammer or a cow kick. Or having extravagent luck during a play. What also gives a really good cast on the leg (if you're just looking for disabilities) is a broken ankle. You can break an ankle by twisting it too far, falling down the stairs. or jumping and then landing on the side of your foot. hope this helps!|`|1FGSADPtaa	skateboarding off a ramp thingy and something was in the way and he went flying and something else was in the way and his leg got crushed    HAHAHAHA omg my answer is stupider than anything. sorry D:|`|smFfcmYuaa	There are only three ways that bones break and it might singularly be one of these or in rare cases all three: impact, leverage, severance (being cut through). The most common way for people to break a leg, and as someone pointed out the lower leg is usually what a person breaks, is from a fall which means leverage. Generally there will be an impact too but the way people usually break the leg is from the leg being stuck one way and weight/force/gravity going the other.     A break can occur in any athletic activity by the way. Biking, skiing, snow or skateboarding, rollarblading (who roller blades anymore? THAT'S character), mountain climbing or hiking, MMA (definitely), a fight of any kind, falling weird when swimming (double whammy) etc.    By the way does it have to be a break? A severe muscle tear is pretty damn dramatic too and though they occur frequently in sports during dramatic situations they're usually for common reasons. Like Andrew Bynum who plays for the Lakers getting ****** up after Kobe fell into him http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news;_ylt=Am...    ugh falling down the stairs in heels? Something that occurred to me after I posted was getting trampled in a crowd at a sale or a concert or anything, a fire drill, whatever.

The Femur (upper leg bone) take alot of force to break and can easily result in other severe wounds such as internal bleeding.  The Tibia and The smaller Fibia can easily be broken with t he right amount of directed force.  something as easy as falling off a 4 foot ladder can result in the Tibia or Fibia breaking.  A friends daughter broke her Tibia by jumping off the bed and landing wrong... *Snap*  lots of crying and a trip to the ER.      Really just use you imagination if the character breaks one of the lower bones,  any moderately significant force would do it.
aNwWauXzaa	Flat bench (grip at the rings), incline bench, decline bench, dumbell press variations, flys, etc.  3-5 sets at 12-15 reps.  Don't trust the weight a machine says and, really, just stay off machines in general.  They force you into one range of motion and don't allow your stabilizers to really come in.

People's bodies are just different and that's why they can eat crap nonstop and still be thin.  All I can say is that you seem to have the diet and exercise thing down, so the only advice I can give you is don't eat when you're not hungry and don't eat after 6-7 at night.
AA11434633	If the guy's blood sugar is not under control, what happens is that the body is unable to utilise the glucose (sugar) from within the bloodstream to create energy.  To combat this, the body begins to break down fat and muscle tissue in an attempt to 'survive'.  (It believes that the body is going through a period of starvation ... a remnant from caveman-like days.)    This is normally one of the major symptoms of how type 1 diabetics are discovered.  (It's much more prevalent in type 1s than in type 2s.  In fact, some type 2 diabetics actually put on weight, but there are subtle differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.)    If the guy you're speaking of is a type 1 diabetic, he really needs to be testing his blood sugar levels more frequently to find out exactly what's going on.  What tends to happen during these periods of 'improper fat metabolism' ... when the body is using them instead of glucose to make energy ... is that ketoacidosis becomes apparent.  This is when the blood becomes acidic and can, in fact, lead to deadly serious consequences.  (You may be able to smell ketones on his breath ... this smells like acetone, or nail polish remover.  This is not a good situation for him to be in.  It will, inevitably, mean that his insulin requirements have changed, and that he needs more.  Unless he's been shown how to make insulin adjustments, he MUST contact his doctor or diabetes specialist nurse for further advice.)|`|k1zMsWxOaa	It's because his body is starving, because his body is not absorbing the food just pissing it all out|`|9TyEDcRzaa	it is a vicious  circle in full blown diabetes  that you pass more urine containing more glucose ---once you pass more glucose you get your appetite and eat more  and produce more glucose that is not wanted by human system  and you pass urine containing  for one molecule of glucose  two molecule water, by this process we evacuate more water from our system  and making the appearance as thinned out till the sugar is controlled|`|cLrkXn6gaa	I have know some people who have gotten diabetes and actually lost weight, even though they kept up with their appetite. In their case it was very simple. They were forced to eat a diabetic diets which is actually a pretty good diet. It is low in fats and sugars, and it actually helps you loose weight.|`|nfIQhpFvaa	Ahh, diabetes! Lets discuss type I diabetes, it is the better model in which to discuss in this instance.    Insulin attracts and allows glucose into all living cells in your body. Without insulin, or sufficient insulin, glucose remains unused and continues to flow through the circulatory system, this causes damage to the body. The body MUST defend itself, one of the ways it does this is to transfer glucose to the kidneys and then bleed it out through the urine. Diabetes Mellitus literally means "Sweet siphon".     Now, because this glucose is unusable without adequate insulin, even fat cells are starved, and, the body will attack the BEST fuel it can find, muscle. A condition of wasting begins, and, one often becomes quite slender. Of course, cells are still starving, thus, impulses given to the brain SHOUT "FEED ME", and, hunger is not an issue! One will want to eat like a horse!    Introduction to the THREE P's.      Polyuria: Frequent urination  Polyphagia: Frequent and intense hunger  Polydipsia : Frequent Intense thirst    Polyuria, as discussed above, the need to bleed off excess glucose levels.    Polyphagia, your cells are starving, they are still sending impulses that they need to be fed, and, you will eat, and eat, and eat, and they are STILL starving.    Polydipsia, this works as a partner to polyuria, since you are voiding water, and, since you still have elevated blood glucose levels, you still need to void out more glucose, the body defends itself further by the brain demanding fluids to meet this threat to the body.    Nighttime is a great snitch!    Getting up several times at night to urinate? There is a reason the body is voiding, you are either a water-junkie, consumed a potent diuretic, or, are voiding a toxin of some sort, in this instance, GLUCOSE! An esseential body fuel that in large quantities, is toxic!     Are you also intensely thirsty but not sweating, just urinating? Another culprit to suspect something is not quite right.    Your family doc will be interested in knowing this, and, an updated HbA1c will tell much of what it going on. This should be handled by an endocrinologist, a doctor that essentially specializes in diabetes (Among a few other things).    Good luck to you!|`|AA10174754	Its common to loose wieght dont worry consult doctor
K8LHoYruaa	They are a bit grim, but done before you know it at the doctors. Unfortunately they do have to go into a large muscle, so the gluteus maximus (aka the fleshy bit of your bottom) is the easiest bit. But don't worry, you don't have to bare all. It will hurt for about 8 hours (great excuse to hog the sofa).    So my recommendation, bit the bullet, get it done (and you will feel better a few days afterwards, anemia is not nice) and then insist on lying on the sofa being waited on hand and foot! If you have to get up at all make a few groany noises, and hopefully see the cups of tea come swarming in!|`|Rk46lIBwaa	It is quite rare to require iron injections, since normally oral iron is rapidly and easily absorbed and the injections have a tiny risk of allergic reactions and can stain if not injected expertly.    The only indications are failure to tolerate or failure to absorb oral iron, both of which are uncommon, except in those who have for example had bowel surgery.    If this unusual iron formulation is for some reason indicated for you it can be given in the GP surgery.|`|mAp90hEeaa	Most doctor's offices can do this service for you.|`|AA12256144	The doctor or the nurse attached to the surgery will give them to you. You'll get them somewhere just below the waistband of your jeans at the back and won't have to undress or anything. The area can be sore for a while but no big deal, just a nuisance. You'll have a lot more energy after the course. Hope this helps. I'm Irish and I've had them myself.
xYTagSIyaa	Tums will neutralize all stomach acid and prevent you from absorbing your vitamins and minerals and any medications you are on as well.  Do not take them within hours of medicines or vitamin pills for this reason.  It is not healthy to take them for any prolonged period  of time.|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	There are very few acids in coffee and they're weak.  The worst acid you can ingest is in colas--phosphoric acid.  Although some phosphorus is necessary for bone formation, it should be in the form of phosphates and even then in a highly dilute, organic form.  You can get it in some shellfish and organ meats.  Like oysters and liver, but it's present in most meats.  You don't have to worry about not getting enough.  Phosphoric acid not only destroys enamel and promotes decay, it also attacks the bones of the jaws.  When white phosphorus was used to make matches the worker's faces would virtually crumble.  It's called "fossy jaw."    Any acid you get in coffee is nothing compared to that, and neither Tums (nor any other antacid) will make a difference, except in your comfort.  Caffeine tends to increase stomach acid production or aggravate stomach irritation.  This is not a "coffee acid" problem, though.|`|e7rKwI30aa	The enamel is really only damaged while you are actually drinking it. Some lingers in your saliva (for up to 24 hours) and that would have an effect, but the initial drinking will have more of one. So yes, but not very much, and make sure you chew them thoroughly so the base gets into your saliva.    (I've never heard of Tums, I'm assuming they're some kind of antacid)|`|FJpPCVTCaa	you can go with mineral supplements, eat dark leafy greens, seaweeds, chew thoroughly and allow oxygen to react with saliva to create an unstable carbonic acid that extracts the minerals from mineral supplements and foods thereafter precipitates the minerals into their ionic form allowing them to remineralize into your enamel. it's a very organic process for maintaining healthy enamel. I wouldn't recommended eating tums because of their heavy metal content.  also, it's best to remineralize your teeth after brushing.

AA12266052	Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are a diverse group of cancers that develop in B or T lymphocytes.  Treatment depends on how quickly the cancer spreads, the stage of the cancer when you are first diagnosed, and symptoms.  Chemotherapy is commonly used. A drug called rituximab (Rituxan) is often used to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Rituxan is a form of immunotherapy.  Radioimmunotherapy may be used in some cases. This involves linking a radioactive substance with an antibody that helps the immune system fight infection, and injecting the substance into the body.  In select cases, a stem cell transplant may be needed.  Rituximab is used alone or with other medications to treat certain types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; a type of cancer that begins in a type of white blood cells that normally fights infection). Rituximab is also used with another medication to treat the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; a condition in which the body attacks its own joints, causing pain, swelling, and loss of function) in people who have already been treated with a certain type of medication called a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. Rituximab is in a class of medications called biologic antineoplastic agents. It treats NHL by causing the death of blood cells that have multiplied abnormally. It treats rheumatoid arthritis by causing the death of certain blood cells that may cause the immune system to attack the joints.
B6CKyzngaa	SPEAKING UP AND WRITING    I'm doing pretty damned good since working in a battered women's shelter 25 years ago and discovering the 'dysfunctional family systems dynamics' materials, for the first time.  If you don't understand how the dysfunctional family works, you'll never understand yourself or how you became the way you are in your adult life. Since then the work of recovery and learning new coping skills in my life and tossing the worthless (what I was taught) mechanisms I previously had used all my life has been ongoing.  The more assertive I've become, and the more I speak up, the more I've taken back my personal power through the years and now I have very healthy boundaries and a most satisfying life.   In the beginning years I wrote about all my thoughts and feelings and got all the hurt and anger and fear outside of myself and I swear to this day, it saved me.  The more I wrote, the more I remembered, and the more perspective I got from my issues so I could deal with them.  I finally destroyed all the writings 2 yrs ago . . . had no more use for hanging onto any of it.  Except I found the poetry that I didn't even realize I had been writing through it all as well and that started me on a whole new path in writing.   Now ..................... since I have no more unresolved issues blocking up the works,I can be creative in my writing and I love it and the flow of poetry now will probably continue throughout my life.  Guess my joy in writing has been in me all along.   I have no links to provide but a thorough list of reading materials that helped me to learn and grow and change my life.  If you're interested, email me at autumlovr@yahoo.com and I'll send you the list.    I will say the definitive books in dysfunctional family systems are written by a man named John Bradshaw.

But, any time that I can I try and read, write, watch tv, do homework (even though it is so boring) or even sleep, just to be by myself and stay distracted.  I try not to let those that are abusing me know that it hurts, because that is the reaction they want- if they think it doesn't bother me then maybe they won't do it anymore.  One of my favorite quotes is, "you can't change the past, but you can ruin the present by worry about the future."  I find it helpful because when I hear it I remember that i cannot change what has happened to be, but by worrying about will happen can make what is happening worse.   I think you may want to talk to someone about what happened, a professional- they can help wonders. Try being alone, being away from those who hurt you, try and stay positive.  Try not fretting about the past, if you don't think about it, don't worry about it, and stay with a clear and open opinion then you can stay focused on the present and be positive =]  Hope this helps!

In the shower, Take a soapy loofah or sponge to the dry skin ONCE and remove the dead skin cells.  THEN dont scrub/soap them again for at least 5 days.  Use  a good skin cream such as aveeno or lush's dream cream to repair the skin.  lavishly put it on several times a day.  at night, you can repair the skin by putting a layer of vaseline on the dry skin overnight.  but it will get on your sheets.

hsEo77F9aa	Answer: respiratory system, mostly    I am copying an answer I gave a while back to a question about how influenza can affect the respiratory system.   _____  There are a few different main strains of influenza that can affect the respiratory system in different ways. The more common 'winter flu' (Influenza B or C) which you are most likely referring to I will explain in detail below. Then there is the 'avian influenza' ( Influenza A ).    With Influenza A, the respiratory system can be catastrophically damaged as a resultof our body's immune response to Influenza A (which the majority of the population has likely not ever been exposed to before). As a result our immune systems overreact leading to cytokine storms and people can go into acute respiratory distress which can be fatal in many cases.    With the more common winter flu, the following can happen.  (I have answered similar questions in the past and I will copy and paste an old answer of mine below):        What can happen inside the body when it comes into contact with the winter flu (Influenza B)......        When you breathe in air containing the flu virus, the virus by no means immediately enters your body. It may get trapped in the layer of slimy mucous that lines your throat and nose, or be swept out by the cilia (the tiny hairs lining the airways that beat 1000 times per minute to waft away intruders.    But, if it latches on to one of your body cells, it's taken inside at once. There it invades the cell's nucleus and takes over the cell's manufacturing ability to make clones of itself. Ten thousand new viruses are made by a single invaded cell. These viruses go out to invade new cells and make even more new viruses, and so the infection spreads.    But as each body cell is taken over by an invading virus, it sends out a distress signal as MHCs (which transport chemicals from inside the cell to the cell surface) carry viral proteins to the surface which are brought to the attention of killer T-cells (which sort of roam the body looking for trouble). Immediately they see the distress signal, coat the cell with toxic chemicals killing it and the virus. Soon the infected spot in your throat is clogged with debris from dead cells.    In rush macrophages (another type of cell) to clean up the mess (they sort of eat it up), aided by histamin, which boosts the blood flowto the infected area to get more white blood cells in (killer T-cells and others).    That is when you become aware of the battle raging in your throat., as the swollen blood vessels press on pain receptors, and the local temperature rises by about 3 degrees celsius as your body tries to speed up the growth of new throat cells.    Soon, chemical signals sent out by the flood of macrophages are generating symptoms all over your body. For a start, your pain threshold is lowered, making your limbs ache. Then a fever commences as your whole body temp rises to help new cells grow and to repair the damage. You start to shiver as your muscles contract to generate heat. Blood vessels in your skin constrict to conserve blood in your body's core, making you feel cold and your skin go pale.    At the same time, blood vessels in your brain swell, increasing pressure and giving you a headache. Paracetamol or aspirin will reduce the fever and other symptoms -- but reducing the fever slows the body's fight against the virus.    Meanwhile, the virus multiplies so rapidly that the killer T-cells can't keep pace., and gradually it begins to spread down into your lungs. Fortunately, the macrophages that have eaten the invaded cells are drifting off through the blood by now and eventually pass through a lymph node or gland. Once in the lymph node, the viral material that the macrophage is carrying is recognized by lymphocytes (white blood cells) that are stored in the gland -- and these immediately go into action. T-cells multiply rapidly, swelling the glands until they become very tender.    T-cells rush through the bloodstream to the battlefield in your throat., where the virus is attacking more and more throat cells. Your throat becomes so clogged with debris that you have to cough to get rid of it.    Meanwhile, a single B-cell (another part of the immune system) in the gland recognizes the viral material, multiplies, and begins to release a flood of antibodies --- over 2000 per second. The tiny antibodies spread rapidly through your body fluids to the site of infection. There they lock on to the virus and prevent it from cloning itself.    At last, the combination of antibodies, T-cells, and macrophages begin to take its toll on the virus and the battle is won. If T-cells and antibodies go on multiplying, they would overwhelm the body, just like cancer. So, the T-cells turn their toxic effects on themselves and the multiplying (antibody-producing) B-cells. Only a few survive, carrying the memory of the battle with them, ready to fight instantly against any renewed infection by the same or similar|`|HOPHWUTraa	no distinct part of the body (It is air-borne though, so you can acquire it through inhalation, or sharing drinks/food with someone who has flu and other severe contact).

So I finally realized I have to work thru what is behind the anxiety and depression which is hard.  I just don't like to deal with emotions but that has been part of my problem, I would ignore how I felt.  I had anxiety so bad we couldn't talk about anything in my session because I was so emotional from the anxiety I couldn't process things right.  So I got on meds first and that has helped to talk about what we needed to talk about.  I figured in order to get thru this and have a better life I need to work with my counselor.  You aren't going to feel better until you are honest with what you need to work on.  It is hard I know but it has been a blessing in that my counselor is good and gives me hope.  My counselor said I may feel worse than I did before I started counseling because I am not ignoring this anymore.  Ignorance is bliss but your body gets to the point of telling you I am not going to let you ignore this anymore.  Do you like your counselor and feel comfortable with him/her?  If not find a new one.  If you do like them know this is what's going to help you get better and enjoy life.  I used to have a lot of anxiety before my sessions but now I look forward to them because I am talking to somebody who knows what I am talking about and has the knowledge to help me work thru it.  I wish I could afford to go daily and get this done plus I feel encouraged after talking to my counselor.  So hang in there and work thru it because the payoff will be worth it.  Look at your sessions as being one step forward of getting better and imagine the end result.  Counseling takes time so you do need to put the work into that you want you to do.

Or, to really make it funny, she could walk downstairs and tell her mum that her pocket money needs to go up because now she's a real woman!    Remember though, your mum was in this position once, she'll understand and probably be pretty proud her little girls a woman!|`|sXI5MnuHaa	Can I ask why she is so scared to talk to her Mom? I am guessing that she is embarrassed and if that is the case then I am also guessing that her Mom is embarrassed about talking to her daughter about these things and that is really sad.  I have an 11 year old daughter that could start her period any day now and she knows all about it b/c I have explained it to her.  Tell your friend that the best advice I can give is to just take a deep breath and do it. All women go through this so it's nothing to be ashamed of.   I bet her Mom will actually be relieved to have this conversation out in the open. If she is a good Mom she has probably been worried about how to approach the subject.  It will be fine!

My daughter had the Heller Myotomy with dor fundoplication.  Don't have the dilation. It has a 60-70% chance of success, usually requires a repeat and is not very "accurate".  The chances of perforating your esophagus are higher than with surgery.    I was just diagnosed and am having the surgery in June.  You can purchase a report from the rare disease organization (created by Society of Surgeons for the Alimentary Tract) for $7.50 US.  The link to the rare disease org on WebMD is http://www.webmd.com/heartburn-gerd/Acha...  Depending on where you live, you need to contact a major hospital.  If the nurse hasn't heard of the disease, you don't want the surgeon operating on you.  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and University Hospitals of Cleveland (Case Medical Center) both perform the surgery frequently.    The BOTOX injection will make the surgery more difficult. My daughter had Botox.  It took two weeks to see results from the first injection, which lasted 6 weeks.  Two months later, we repeated the Botox injection.  She was able to eat immediately but that only lasted for less than a month.  The Botox is not a long lasting treatment anyway, so unless you cannot have the laproscopic or open myotomy, I wouldn't bother.  Neither would my surgeon.|`|AA11743017	It is not that rare.. its a gastro esophagic disorder...  Achalasia means "no relaxation "in greek..  It is the persistant contraction on the lower part of the oesophagus (the alimentary pipe), just above the stomach...yes, you have felt it....meals stuck for 2 minutes or so in your lower chest, inability to swallow at normal speed, end sometimes "sensation of choking" even with small meals.  Most of the times, it subsides with simple medications  such as propantheline, nimedipine (if it is too strong or cumbersome), etc.  If endoscopy (looking inside of the esophagus under sedation and mild anesthesiA)  does not show improvement with diet without irritants and antiespasmodics, then, inflating a special "saline" baloon inside of the constricted or contracted lowest part of the esophagus, will in a controlled manner "tear" the contracted muscle, and there is success in about 78-82% ofcases, according to age group (the younger, the better results obtained).  The last resort, if despite that procedure, the contraction persists, the open surgery, in order to "open" the contracted muscular ring (which is formed of smooth or involuntary fibers) is cut in a controlled manner.  Open surgery is VERY SELDOM needed.  You will be OK.,...do not worry|`|8f6fbf8cd859c15e94f8ec3588ab74a2aa	It is indeed a rare disorder.  It means the sphincter from your esophagus  to your stomach is either very tight or closed altogether.  It will make you have chest pain when eating and be unable to eat large portions of food. You may vomit frequently and have terrible heartburn.  You may even vomit in your sleep.  What happens is, the food builds up in the esophagus and will not go into the stomach and be digested.  (or at least it is very slow.)   The specialist will want to do a procedure  with a balloon to stretch the sphincter in order to get the food to go down properly.  It does not last forever and you may have to repeat this procedure a few times in your lifetime.  There are a few other treatments like botox.  You will need to take medicine for reflux and be careful about chewing your food thoroughly. Hope this helps.  Good luck

AA11096432	I have done the Master Cleanse as a kick start to my diet.     Here is the receipe.    For a minimum of 10 days, drink:  2 Tablespoons (1 fluid ounce) fresh-squeezed lemon or lime juice (approx. ? lemon),  2 Tablespoons (1 fluid ounce) organic Grade B maple syrup, not maple-flavored sugar syrup or syrup from companies that use formaldehyde to harvest their syrup  1/10 Teaspoon or more cayenne pepper (hot red pepper), and  1 Cup (8 fluid ounces) purified or spring water, NOT fluoridated water.  Drink six to twelve glasses of this lemonade mixture daily. No food is eaten nor any vitamin supplements taken during the cleanse. If you get hungry, have another glass of lemonade. After all, this is also called the "Lemonade Diet."  If you are overweight, you may use less maple syrup. If you are underweight, use more maple syrup if you wish.   If you are worried about losing weight, Burroughs says, "The only things you can possibly lose are mucus, waste, and disease. Healthy tissue will not be eliminated."  Do not vary the amount of lemon juice per glass and be sure to drink at least six glasses of lemonade a day. You can drink more water, if you want.  As a reducing diet it is superior in every way to any other system because it dissolves and eliminates all types of fatty tissue. Fat melts away at the rate of about two pounds a day for most persons-and without any harmful side effects.  All mucus diseases such as colds, flu, asthma, hay fever, sinus and bronchial troubles are rapidly dissolved and eliminated from the body, leaving the user free from the varied allergies which cause difficult breathing and clogging of the sinus cavities. Allergies exist as a result of an accumulation of these toxins and they vanish as we cleanse our body. People who are over-weight often experience these difficulties, and the more they continue to eat the toxic fat-producing foods which cause their obesity, the more their other ailments multiply.  Mucus disorders are brought about by the eating or drinking of mucus-forming foods. In other words, if you have these diseases, you at them! As we stop feeding our family mucus-forming foods, we can eliminate their mucus and allergy diseases for the rest of their lives.  The types of disease which are a result of calcium deposits in the joints, muscles, cells, and glands are readily dissolved and removed from the body. Cholesterol deposits in the arteries and veins also respond to the magic cleansing power of the lemonade diet. All skin disorders also disappear as the rest of the body is cleansed. Boils, abscesses, carbuncles, and pimples all come under this category. These conditions are again Nature's effort to eliminate poisons quickly from the body.  All types of infections are the result of these vast accumulations of poisons being dissolved and burned or oxidized to produce further cleansing of the body. Therefore, rapid elimination of the toxins relieves the need for infectious fevers of all kinds. Infections are not "caught," they are created by Nature to assist in burning our surplus wastes.   Yes, the lemonade diet is a reducing diet, but much more. Just as many other disorders also cleared up at the same time when it was used to heal ulcers, when it is used as a reducing diet other ailments are also corrected in the process.  People build strong, healthy bodies from the correct foods or they build diseased bodies from incorrect foods. When disease does become necessary, the lemonade diet will prove its superior cleansing and building ability.|`|ICBKpZeAaa	I found some good info here.|`|wvrRec5Uaa	I have and i feel like it didnt work!

Treadmills, its easy to hop off and get some water, and go back on...and not get a whole session in.      I know i prefer walking outdoors, than on a treadmill or indoors.  I like being outside in the fresh air and sunshine.
jU4xZF2Kaa	Watch this video!    And Look at the site I listed 2nd.  It has an explanation in writing.|`|8CaOYfacaa	Yes, ovulation is the best time for conception.    Ovulation is when the eggs leave the ovaries and travel into the fallopian tubes and travel down into the uterus.     If sperm meets them, then they attach to the uterine wall and fertalize....and your pregnant.     If they are not met by the lil spermy guys, the entire cycle is flushed out, and cleaned out(your period) and ready for the next cycle.     Birth control prevents the 2 ever meeting, but is NOT 100% effective...So if your sexually active, always use other forms(ie condom) for birth control.     I'm putting it in laymans terms of course. :)    put a couple sites below to help ya learn more...|`|QtxeL2n9aa	best to ask your mom you know|`|AA12366146	Hun it just means to have your period....don't worry I'm kinda new to it to....but I asked my mom a few weeks ago....|`|m2dhwsM7aa	To ovulate means to have your period. If you look it up in the dictionary it says, "to discharge eggs." hahaha! :]
rF7EzWxkaa	I was on birth control pills for a long time,they where effective on pregnancy protection,but my periods have never been "normal" since,by normal,I would say,3-7 days and not disgustingly heavy, bright red and darker towards the end. . I have heard that depo-privera is  a good way to deal with all of the" worries"...Good Luck, and  maybe ask at state health dept.?sincerely...|`|8CaOYfacaa	It takes bout 30 or more days of constant use of the birth control pill for it to take full affect.   The side effects and the bleeding is normal.      If it doesnt let up in another 2 weeks or so....speak to your gyno.|`|f10ebdaf0188ca166507aae70c628222aa	brown only means oxygen is getting to it and oxydizing it. slow flows that are fairly light will often be brownish,|`|k0KXIFAsaa	Dark reddish to brown flow is simply 'old' blood exiting your body, perfectly normal.  Be concerned if it ever has a foul odor.
c76c660db1a4fbcebcc40e5235f7160eaa	I agree, it sounds to me like you're having episodes of low blood sugar. My best friend is diabetic and she hasn't always taken as good a care of herself as she should. I've seen her when her blood sugar has been dangerously low and she always seemed very "drunk" and lethargic. I'd have your parents set you up an appointment to get tested for diabetes and hypoglycemia. Hope you get better. :)|`|b7541969faf292aa4cdfe0bbcba73f69aa	I am no expert, but these are symptoms I had when I was anemic.  Drink plenty of fluid and ask your parent/guardian to take you to the doctor.  Asthma came to mind for the SOB and the tiredness, but the other symptoms seem contraindicatory.  Talk to your doctor.  The memory loss can be a trigger by your body to tell your brain to get help.  The other thing that I thought about but did not rule out yet is something related to your ears.  Get a thorough medical exam to find out.|`|P9XxUAjhaa	you sound like you are lacking vitamins.   You should consider seeing a nutritionist.|`|hQA0ByNcaa	Sounds alot like Hypoglycemia. Its a low bloodsugar. You need to eat more often.
9560e55bc0e0da941c3e0745bd33ed41aa	I'm sorry to hear that you're (periodically) in so much pain that you have these thoughts.  Do you have support?  Maybe a support group or counseling would be of help?    Good luck.  You shouldn't have to feel this way.|`|b7541969faf292aa4cdfe0bbcba73f69aa	Please don't give up on life.  You are valuable!  You should explore things that give you a sense of purpose.  Devote your time to things that make you feel good, things that bring others joy and things that are important.  Consider volunteering, mowing lawns for elderly people or something.  Also, do not ignore your suicidal thoughts.  Everyone experiences some doubts about their effectiveness as a person and their place in this world, but do not let others create a living hell for you.  Talk to a physician or psychologist.  You may need a short term treatment plan to help or some short term counseling to help put things in perspective!  I work with mentally ill teenagers.  I also work with non-mentally ill teens.  Over half of both have attempted to commit suicide.  75% have thought about it.  You may just need some help over the rough spot.|`|SEUObVoSaa	Sounds like suicide is the right choice for you.  Just because no one will care should not stop you.  Just remember whether you die tomorrow or 20 years from now, the next day is always  the same.|`|ft893Udgaa	I think the best thing to do is break it down to one day at a time. Try to seek out a confidential counsellor that you feel comfortable with and talk to them. When I was young, I lost my dad to cancer, he was my foundation. I had suicidal thoughts as my mother tried to move on and life just seemed to be kicking my ***. But talking really helped me and just taking things slowly, one thing at a time got me through. We all have someone we trust and even if you're scared, sharing these thoughts will ease some of the burden. Take small steps, life is definitely worth living, even when we are taking lumps. It' s how we know there are good things to appreciate when things are going well.|`|b7573437be6b5bcf439589edbb4ce3faaa	See http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris on suicidal thoughts & depression pages, and note the tips on the mental-health-abc & conquering stress websites. Accept that YOU are responsible for how YOU feel. It is YOUR CHOICE! By blaming others for your condition, your self limiting belief has become a barrier to progress.|`|vG4dQXmcaa	Honey..I am 23 and I AM suicidal at all times...My feelings of lonliness,anger,hatered, depression, worthlessness, low self esteem all trigger it. I am going to tell you something that i never told anyone before...but the whole world is going to know now....I am a cutter. I know how you feel about the people responsible for ur suicial thoughts deserving all the pain. and you are right, if they have no heart, conscience,or anything..they will not care. It is true today...when people are watching the news..and a headline of a person commiting suicide comes on the screen, they flip the channel. There is still help for you...and you should forget that "these worthless individuals exsist" and go on living your life. If you commit suicide....and the people who you are mad at know...they will not care. so you will only be hurting your family and yourself. What i do, is i write poetry about my feelings and it seems to help getting it out on paper. I too cannot give up on life because i own my own businesses...2 pet store and 2 grooming salons and i am an Animal Cruelty Investigator. no matter how much i want to cut or commit suicide I can't leave my family or my animals at my store or the animals who need me the most...the abused neglected ones.

a5f944a80cb70326ff2ee0c1809cc69eaa	You need to change ur diet because variety is good for u.  Dont eat the same BF daily. Have something differenteg. eggs, sugar free egg pudding ,cereal,etc. rotate it a bit.  Dont have a sandwich for lunch everyday. Have a salad, fat free yoghurt, some fruit, brown rice, some protein like grilled fish, chicken etc. Have low fat cheese ,it'll stave off hunger for a longer period. U can add it to ur salad. Make salad ahead for 2/3 days & carry it to work ifu want.Add flaxseeds,psyllium husks, beans, etc to make it balanced.U can also add fish or chicken to ur salad.  have fruits, munch on celery or cucumber etc. for snacks, yoghurt is good too.  Dont have grains for dinner, no pasta, no bread. U can have some brown rice instead(about 4-5 tbsp)with meat, salad, fruits.  Swim, jog, use a treadmill.Or walk!  HAve water every opportunity u get.  Cut down on caffeine. Start having milk, low fat.  No sugars, no alcohol, no sodas except diet without caffeine maybe once a day|`|ICBKpZeAaa	Some good guides are here.|`|1yVZSb5zaa	Look up a book called THE ABS DIET.|`|zmamUDlRaa	Make sure to eliminate junk and fast foods. Always eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, of course, as a substitute. There are certain foods that can help you lose weight--check out http://www.realhomeremedies.com for more weight loss tips.|`|07GeBS6Aaa	I am obese, and as of January, been determined to get rid of my extra pounds.  My family got a pass to the recreation center at the end of January, and it has been really great.  I entered their Biggest Loser contest, and have a personal trainer for the contest.  But, I am always mindful that this is a lifestyle change, not just a silly contest.  I will share some tips that I have learned from my trainers and from the nutritionists...(I have lost over 12 pounds, and 7 inches off my waist, and gained muscle!)    1.  Eat smaller, more frequent meals.  This allows your metabolism to keep going, and your stomach to shrink, and helps you to not be hungry throughout the day, thereby reducing your urge to splurge and overeat.    2.  Limit your carb intake, especially your white breads and rice.  Use wheat and whole grain.  At first it's hard to get use to it, but you will.  I am!  If you fill up on carbs, your body feels hungrier faster, and you will crave bad foods.  It's a vicious cycle.  3.  Eat more protein.  The lean kind.  Tuna, cottage cheese, and eggs are a great source.  But not only these.  There are tons of choices out there.  Protein should be eaten about 1/2 hour after your workout, because it helps to rebuild the muscle tissues.    4.  Drink lots of water.  Your body will use it!  5.  Hate to say it, but cut the sugars.  These are just BAD, Bad, bad.  6.  However, do allow yourself a small break.  We get a free day, to eat and enjoy what we want!  It's a good incentive.    7.  Write down EVERYTHING you cosume every day.  Keep a notebook with you to keep track of what you eat, the portion size, and the calories in it.  go to www.my-calorie-counter.com.  When you write your intake down, you will begin to see the reality of what you eat.  It is great later, too, because you can go back to review your progress.      8. Exercise.  This is the tough one for me.  But it is really very necessary.    9.  The object of the game is to shock your body.  You need to keep your body guessing so that it doesn't learn how to keep the weight on even when you are exercising.  SO,...vary your exercise routines.    10.  Do weights and then cardio.  The reason for this is that it takes approx. 1/2 hour to burn out the sugars and other "bad stuff" in your body before your body will begin to burn fat.  If you lift some weights for that time, then your cardio will be total fat burning!  11.  Vary your weights and cardio.  On weights, exercise one muscle group per day. So, say on day on 1, exercise your upper arm muscles.  Day 2, work on your legs, day 3, do chest and/or back...etc.  This break gives the muscles a chance to build back up and repair so you don't over work the muscles.  12.  For cardio, do walking on day one, swimming on day 2, elliptical on day 3, aerobics on day four, etc.  If you choose to just walk, then vary that.  Speed walk for 2 minutes, recover walk (a little slower) for 1.  Or "walk the line".  That means that for 3 minutes walk like you are walking on a tightrope.  You'll feel different muscle groups working (like your "glutes").    13.  Keep going.  This is the most important tip of all.  Remember that the ultimate goal is to be HEALTHIER, not skinnier.  The healthiest you may not be the same size at the 15 year old down the street.      I hope that helps.  I follow these rules, and it has helped me.  Good luck to you!!!  You can do it!!!
20e4f6b8dcd1a9a14bc639c86c76f038aa	Nothing you say or do will get him to quit. I smoked for 20 years, and I'm telling you, until he is ready he will not quit, it is better to get off his @ss, he is a big boy and can make the right choice when he is ready to do so. Hounding someone to quit only upsets them, makes them feel guilty and pissed which leads right back to the comfort of smoking more.    I finally quit because I was ready, not because someone told me I should.|`|ICBKpZeAaa	There might be something here to help him.|`|26f367a805d1972fcb3ba5b055e15cf3aa	take a wallet sized picture of you and on the back write "please, for me." and stick it in his cig pack.|`|7gnRezZEaa	Well quitting drinking is a start.I believe exercise and fitness is the best way,also eating right.He will see the difference right away.|`|f51819d6214e7edb4a9a7a78ec5fb4a6aa	I'm sorry i can't really help.. smoking is an addiction, he has to go to rehab... but while he is trying to quit smoking you can get him to like something healthier for him, like in stead of taking a smoke, he can just suck on a lollipop or something, i heard that works for some.
8CaOYfacaa	Ouch....i bet they arent the kind u can wear 24/7.   Get your bottle of solution or eye drops..and put a few drops in each eye. Close your eye and lightly rub the eyelid......this will moisten the contact.    Now, pull down and hold your lower lid..take your index finger and move it over the contact until the contact moves. Slide it downward toward your lower lid and pinch it carefully.      It should come right out.    Ive done this many times...fallen asleep in contacts and wake up...and they are dry.  The solution helps moisten them...and getting them out.

AA11094078	You must be careful because used treadmills have already taken a beaten from their former user.  Most motors don't last over 2 years.

AA10475164	Move... Exercise. Run. Play sports. First, being 6'2'' and only 150 is rather skinny. I'd suggest weight lifting to get bigger. A healthy weight at that level is about 175. Eat right. Stay away from fast food and soda. Drink plenty of water. About the acne and hair...shower daily in the morning using shampoo/conditioner and soap.    If your looking for the best way to lose weight, just run. 20 to 30 minutes a day will shed the weight in a month. Sit ups and crunches will help a lot as well.|`|JFLFGZ9yaa	You are 150-155 at 6'1" or 6'2" and you think you are overweight!?!  That is ridiculous.    Just stay active and your body fat should decrease.  Try to do something active every day.    Plaster your hair down with water in the morning.    Take a shower before you got to bed and make sure your sheets are clean.  (Don't go to bed with all the oil and grease from the day still on your face.)|`|dev5xuGraa	Eat healthy foods and make sure that your calorie intake is less than the calories that you burn.Find out what your healthy weight should be and how many calories/day you would need to maintain this weight  (remember this will depend on your daily level of physical activity) To do this, record everthing that you eat for say 7-10 days and work out (buy a calorie counter book) how many calories you are in consuming each day. This will be a pain to do but well worth the effort. You will need to do physical activity each day (maybe walk at first) and slowly increase this intensity.The best way I have found to buid up intensity is to buy a skipping rope and an interval timer. You can skip rope practically anywhere as long as you have good shoes and a surface that cushions. With an interval timer, you can set the duration you want to train for and also set your rest time between each set. Over time you can slowly build up the intensity i.e. skip for a longer period and shorten your rest period between each set.The best interval timer I have used is called the GYMBOSS and is only around $25 (Australian $).  I discovered this timer at www.gymboss at it is really worth the money. Get one of these, use it daily, eat healthy food and you WILL lose weight and get really fit.  Good luck!|`|AakDEbwwaa	Excuse me? You're 6'2, 150 and you think you're overweight? For a male runway model maybe. That's ridiculous.  I realize you're still a kid, but I still can't imagine that you'd be overweight at 150 lbs. Probably what you need is to tone up and reshape your body. You're old enough now to start lifting weights--maybe just some light ones, or just doing some pull-ups, pushups, and other fitness exercises. When I was your age I was around 6' and probably weighed just a bit more than you do, and I've always been lean. Maybe you just need to start building more muscle. As for the hair--cut it short and get some decent hair gel. Acne--hm, never had that, but I know there are some good products out there--what's that one Jessica Simpson endorses? Pro-active? Good luck.

AA11689215	You picked up where you left off at?  Not a good idea since the exercises are new again.    First, stretch before and after.    Second, stick with it.  Your muscles have to adapt.|`|7AqZzEEWaa	after a lay off period you must start slowly.

Also, a soak in a nice hot bath can help to relax the muscles.     You should always make sure you warm up prior to your workout. Doing some stretching after you work out can help your muscles not get so sore. And, as always, make sure you drink lots of water and stay well hydrated...it helps to flush the lactic acid that makes your muscles hurt.|`|AA11616665	Dude,  you way over did it. Sounds like you really strained some muscles.  Try ice for the first 24 hours along with ibuprofen-  maybe 800 milligrams every 4 hours.    After that get a massage and find a hot tube.     You have to gradually get back into it over a period of several weeks.|`|7a234017cb81ddcda3d45081ba715b71aa	6 months? You should probably take it slow down giving yourself an extra day or two to recover. Proper warm-up and stretching following your workout (not before). A healthy diet and plenty of rest is a must.|`|67DLXMdCaa	First of all.  DO NOT stretch before workouts (I know, sounds counter-intuitive but listen).  When you do static stretches (which is what I'm sure the person above is referring to), you will relax your muscles.  When you lift, you don't want your muscles relaxed!  You will be more prone to injury.  It is good to stretch after your workout though.  Also, you have to ease yourself back into the workout.  In any case, the soreness will soon wear off.  Just be consistent, and the soreness will soon subside.  It's just your body trying to get used to the "shock" again.  There are also research done with stretching done before and after workouts if you look around.  The researchers concluded that postworkout is when you should stretch and not pre.  For a temporary fix, get some ibuprofen, but as soon as you're not feeling sore anymore, get off it.    PS***   I forgot to mention.  Static stretches preworkout are bad.  Do plyometric type stretches before which is a better way to stretch before workouts.

Hope you find good results.|`|TgzqOtMOaa	That's a toughie.  A combination of muscle training, cardio, supplements, and diet.  As far as resistance training is concerned, it's important to focus not only on bench pressing, but on different exercises to target different muscle groups within the pecs.  To get all around definition, research some exercises such as bench press, incline/decline bench press, pec dec fly, and good ole push ups.  The number of sets and reps will depend on your starting place, and your goal.  Incorporate cardio to lose body fat and tone more, and of course with that goes a good diet high in protein to build muscles.  Supplementation will speed up the process for most people.  Personal Trainers are always a good way to go.  For a less expensive route, try muscle and fitness magazine for good tips.|`|MngKs4j6aa	a good way is by benchpressing, buy weight bench (they arent that expensive, like 100 bucks used )|`|01f71dd6832cb5f9690bdf21f2b20ed6aa	That's kind of hard to answer, it's a little vague.

hODBKb0oaa	One of the best, and least depriving, ways to do what you want to do is to walk.  There isn't much choice between "large" lower body and slimmer lower body, and walking is the most effective way to accomplish your goal.  Here's a weird fact: you burn just as many calories walking as jogging or running!  The difference is the time it takes to do it.  Start off at a half a mile every other day, and when you feel as though it's time, go to a mile every other day.  Then more often, and the next step is two miles a day.  Two miles a day is optimum for the kind of body sculpting you seem to want, and I've lost 45 lbs. this way, with only moderate diet changes, since November.  This is a good rate to take it off, and keep it off.  And those legs?  You'll have to wear pants or long skirts to keep folks from noticing how hot they are!|`|kRAuF2TSaa	Just check it out here: http://scholarforum.com/52_tips_for_losi...

dlk6AsbGaa	I can tell u have heard something about this subject, but havent gotten any real answers.  puberty is not something that can be stopped.  as we develop, our bodies start releasing hormones no matter what, its in our genes.  What i think u are referring to is a condition called Amenorrhea.  It occurs when a female stops having her menses (her period) because her body recognizes that she is too unhealthy to have a child.  your body solely bases this off the amount of body fat you have in your body.  if its too low, the body knows that you will not have enough energy to be able to nurture a growing baby inside.  Amenorrhea happens to those who have only realllly bad diets such as those with Anorexia nervosa (when someone is basically starving themself of food), or can also happen to very healthy female athletes who work out so often they have a very low body fat %.  lack of exercise, or fatty diets are not going to delay or cause u to have no menstruation.      if u werent talking about amnorrhea, then the answer is no, bad diet does not delay puberty, and neither does a lack of exercise.  :)    hope this helps!|`|25qCnjR4aa	yes, yes...........................  Have you seen those videos from Africa or from some really poor countries?  God, your mind does not even work at the same level, that does not mean they're not inteligent, this mean your brain works harder to asimilate knowledge.  Lack of exercise is a factor for overweight people, health issues come after.........  The best formula is a lovely caring family, good nutrition and exercise for a good puberty.........What do you think?  And also enjoy it every minute, those wonderful years never come back, while you rash to become an adult and once you are one of them, really puberty is the best it can happen to you, it will give you time to undertand your body chances and also take challenges.............facts of life.|`|7TM7jh43aa	It wouldn't really "delay" the process, puberty develops depending on your genetics.  but....eating right and exercise influence too.      during that early stage it is very important that you do have a good diet and you do exercise regularly so that your body can develop to its best potential.
hODBKb0oaa	You don't need to lose 20 lbs, but, yes you can lose your "gut."   Start today, walking - you burn just as many calories walking the same distance as you do running or jogging, it just takes longer, but you see more, and it's easier on your knees and ankles.  Skip or go easy on the bread, pasta  and potatoes (of course, no junk food),  eat your veggies and proteins, and drink plenty of water.  (You will lose a few lbs this way,  just from the water - 8 8 oz. glasses/day.)  Work up to walking 2 miles a day (the optimum) and in a couple of months you will be blown away at the change in your appearance, and the change in your metabolism will last.  But please remember, if you aren't already walking, start with a shorter distance - 1/2 mi., maybe, every other day - you don't want to shift into overdrive right away because you'll only hurt yourself and cause some unwanted downtime.  Swinging your arms as you walk will also help get rid of your "problem."|`|55f461f12551fde73da23dc258fb272caa	20 lbs?  that might be a little fast, lets see 10 weeks, 2 lbs per week....well that might be okay.  you're young, 2 lbs a week shouldn't cause too much harm, but if you start feeling lightheaded then it might be too much for you and you'll need to slow down.|`|jBgHBDzIaa	Doing Cardio training is the most effective / best way to burn off calories, thus losing WEIGHT.  ;-)    The crunches will help tighten up your abs, which is good, but if you've got a beer belly the cardio will be better for you overall.

As far as your reaction to being put under it is different with everyone but usually the nausea goes away soon after you come out of surgery.

I am merely guessing here but here are few reasons why he might have had a wet dream:    1) Not enough sex   2) Not quality or adventurous sex  3) He is sex mad (thinking of it all the time even in sleep)  4) He has fantasies - but doesn't necessarily want to carry them out in real life, hence, he does them in his dream  5) Something he ate/or happened through the day to provoke the dream    I wouldn't worry about it, but best asking him if you are concerned.|`|6pJIyqaYaa	I learned this in sex ed. =]  The male body produces sperm every day.

A male produces semen (ejaculate) in the testicles, when a male does not use the semen at the rate its being produced the body rids the testicles of the semen. This is known as a wet dream. However, this does not always happen as with the above stated scenario. Males who Masturbate daily at a specific time can train their bodies to release ejaculate, therefore, if the male does not release at the time they normally do, they can have a wet dream. And lastly, a male who masturbates regularly as stated above can still have wet dreams if their body produces it as such a high rate, they cannot get rid of it fast enough. These are some few instances where men can have wet dreams. They are nothing to worry about and they are completely harmless and they can happen to any male, at any age.    Thank You|`|NkSbTyEcaa	i'm 21 and still get them but rarely, but yes it happens, if a guy dosn't have sex or masterbate for a period of time the body finds its own way of relese.. so thats one good reason for guys to make thier girls open em up.......think of it as laundry..you need to change the load daily.|`|BTHUuOVraa	It's all about wanking, the more you do, the less you get them.

Over the course of those years I have been on Prozac, Paxil, or no anti-depressant. I prefer not to have to take an anti-depressant, but have done so when my depression was too severe for me to manage on my own. I'm currently not on any anti-depressants.    My experience with Prozac was a very good one. My doctors have all told me that Prozac won't "cure" my depression, but evens out and balances my moods so that I can actually deal with the depression through what I learned in counselling and advice of my doctors. I never experienced any side effects while taking or coming off of Prozac. I was able to come from barely being able to function well enough to drag myself through a day to being able to being able to manage most of the time without any long-term prescriptions. I will always have to work hard to keep depression at bay and feel "normal" emotions (whatever "normal" is ), but I'm now able to go through days, weeks, and months using those strategies and techniques.     The doctor who first prescribed Prozac for me commented that this drug worked for me so well that is was almost like it was made specifically for me. Nevertheless, although I'm thankful for how it helped me, I'm thrilled to be able to function without it. Not all people have the same response to this medication, so keep in close contact with your doctor to monitor how it's working for you.    I wish you success!|`|mX5SECoCaa	when i first was put on prozac (20 mg) i became less irritable and a little happier.

AakDEbwwaa	Work your back muscles--especially upper back, and posterior deltoid (back of the shoulder) muscles. These muscles will help pull your humorus back (upper arm bone). Ever notice how erect gymnasts walk and how amateur body builders walk with their shoulders forward? A lot of amateur body builders over develop their chest muscles which pull the arm bone forward, while gymnasts do exercises that work the back and shoulders. If you can do pullups or any type of exercise to develop these upper back and shoulder muscles, you will be good to go. Even doing simple exercises (preferably with small weights) where you pull your shoulders back and hold for a few seconds--like you want to squeeze your shoulder blades together should help.

And don't forget to drink your water, the water helps the body flush all the bad stuff from our system and keeps the body / organs functioning properly.     no soda pop / cokes ; coffee ; tea - unless its herbal tea ; no beer / alcohol ; no chips / cookies / cakes / pies / candy's ;     get at least 30 minutes of walking in a day - a good fast walk rather than a slow one, the average speed of a good fast walk is 4 miles an hour - so 2 miles in half an hour , but if you are not used to walking fast it will take your body time to get used to it and get that fast, and don't over do it, you don't want to pass out - set a pace, if you need to stop and take a 5 minute rest.     walking is the absolute best exercise for our bodies!    http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_r...     thats a search here in yahoo answers about diet + lose + weight, check out what others have said.|`|WY9fwxxpaa	Best thing to do is prepare you meal at home.

Internal and external. Internal is the one which causes more bleeding and pain. There are 4 degrees (stages )of hemorrhoids.  Please consult a Surgeon for which stage you are in. If it is 1st degree, you could just get cured by regular medicines and drugs. For stage 2, it could be rectified by banding, Infra red coagulation, laser etc. For stage 3, surgery is a must. In which Surgeon may coagulate or cut the hanging hemorrhoids. The best treatment for late 3rd and early 4th stage hemorrhoids, is : Hemorrhoidal Staplers. All the earlier methods, the patient will suffer from lot of pain before treatment. Even after treatment, he will recover only around 15-20 days later and cannot go for work. But, if staplers are to be used.. which can be done if the patient is in that stage ONLY, the patient can get back to work in 2-3 days and will be completely relieved of pain. This is because, the stapler removes a band of mucosa and sub-mucosa, pulls the two circular cut ends together and applies circular staples. Since, this procedure is done in a no-pain area, patient is comfortable after surgery. But, all other surgical methods are done within 2 cm from the anus, and hence it takes time for relief.    Hope this helps. But, see a sugeon to know the stage you are in and insist for stapler surgery. Believe me, you will have a tremendous comfort.

Eat 6 small meals a day about every 4 hours. Here what that will do for you, your metabolism will increase (i.e. Loose weight) and you will have  more engry. If you go on a diet and eat less, your metabolism will slow down and store to fat. That is why diets dont work. Only the size of your fist, carbs (examples:baked potato, pasta, oatmeal, beans, corn, melon, apples, fat free yogurt, whole wheat breads)in one and protien (examples:chicken breast, swordfish, shrimp, turkey breast) in the other. You can also eat vegetables and salads with any meal, they dont have none or little fat). 30min cardo exercise every day. Any of these(examples: walking, jogging, swimming,running, biking, ect), Monday cardo, tues upper body (arms: curls, tricep extensions,pull ups, front press)(abdominals: leg pull crunch, leg raises), (chest: bench press, butterfly, pullover)(shoulders: front press, arm pullover, cross county skier machine)(back:seated row, lat pull downs, back extension)(YOU DONT HAVE TO DO IN ONE DAY, mix it up) wed cardo, thurs lower body (legs: leg pull,leg press, squats, lounges) fri cardo, sat upper. Sunday eat anything you want and dont exercising, you do this on sunday so your body doesnt go into starvation mode. YOU NEED TO TAKE SUNDAY OFF. If you stilck with this you will have a great body. also drink aleast 8oz of water daily!

AA11937969	I know someone who had the operation many years ago.  They can walk and swim OK but climbing stairs is a problem.    However, with sports players being such expensive commodities much research has been carried out to alleviate kneecap  injuries.    Cartilage may be removed and replaced but when the kneecap is removed that generally spells the end of their career.    Current research is beginning to show a little progress towards the use of cartilage and bones from stem cells.    However, this will take a few years.  If you are having a patellectomy you will be given physiotherapy afterwards.    I am sure you will cope and compensate by engaging in less strenuous physical tasks.    Stephen Hawkins keeps going although the medical profession gave up on him years ago when they said he wouldn't last two years.|`|7c453c69a2fd3933d0656c03f5488174aa	How can you have your patella removed?

c1a35f4b8b8ef571104caac321928f89aa	The simple solution is for her to tell them how to pronounce her name.  If she won't correct them they won't know they are saying it wrong.|`|6645d2a41577989dc2d405ab797e5766aa	I believe people and or businesses that are going to go out their way for you are going to take time and get things done right. Including your name, especially your name. Cause they understand it is that important to you. I too, have that problem where businesses or people would misspell my name after I have made it clear to them. So, I have made up my mine that if they can't get my name right then I won't be doing business with them.|`|7d8457cd14e8c51f108c9ec4590fc638aa	People usually mispronounce my name, too.  I just calmly correct them each time. ("My name is pronounced --------")  I don't take it as an intentional act of disrespect.  It is annoying when the same person does it repeatedly, but I don't take it personally;  some people just have a hard time with names.  And if your name is an unusual one, it makes it that much more difficult.|`|f05f20f939f9a237ff9e746880cf2504aa	tell her to get the doctor to pronounce her name correctly or she can pronounce her name to the doctor (to teach how to pronounce it) or you as a favorable friend why don't you sees the doctor about it. Your friend would appreciate it.|`|6c23fd007e16704e8c347ac71b4e3e73aa	If the program is working in favor of your friend-who cares how they pronounce her name.  Her treatment should be her primary concern.  We all have too be a little more tolerant of each other.  The abled, the disabled, the doctor, the whomever. Bottom line, we all are just people! She should be extremely upset if the program wasn't working for her-not how they pronounce her name when she's there!!!!  Most people with names that are dificult to pronounce, use a shorter version of the name or nick name.  Suggest she try doing so.|`|AA10046040	I don't think that word pronunciation has anything to do with the quality of care that she may be receiving.  Doctors are used to pronouncing difficult medical words, so perhaps your friend has not educated them with the correct pronunciation.  I have worked with doctors in the past and if it is a real bone of contention with a patient about how their name is pronounced, the doctor will usually write it phonetically on their chart to remind them.  If your friend is receiving high quality care, then I would suggest to her that she stay in the program, and not get upset over what seems to me to be "the small stuff".  And BTW, very few people get my name right, and it's just something I have to live with.|`|fef39cf87650c8250aa251223b14a134aa	No, I probably would not continue...if put in a similar situation as your friend I guess most people would get upset, because it's a really B I G sign of ignorance of personality.

One of the first dentists that I worked for did payment plans on items like dentures and crowns. He stopped when people stopped making their payments, claiming unexpected expenses coming up and other such things. I have not worked for a dentist after that who would do payment plans other than some type of outside financing such as Care Credit.     The reason that most dentists will not do payment plans any longer is because some patients are just plain dishonest and have no intention of paying for their dental services. Others have every intention of paying, but when it comes down to paying the dentist or paying for a new motor in their car, what do you think they choose to pay for? Usually it is not the dentist.    As much as many people think that dentists are money hungry crooks, they are business people who want to make a good living and be able to have a good lifestyle. Of course, this lifestyle is above what most of us have, but for someone who spent over $300,000 on dental school, they have every right to this lifestyle. But remember that, they are also employers that are providing many woman a way to support their families.    So, you may be able to find a dentist to do a payment plan for you, but please don't think badly of them if they are not willing to.

Anti-depressants work on the chemical levels in your brain, affecting mood, energy, feelings of well-being, etc. People have their morals and values socialized into them at a very young age, well before mental illness (or its treatment) would be a factor.     Basic values and morals change if the individual is resocialized into an entirely different culture, and even then it is nearly impossible to totally abandon one's "native" mores. This really is not the same effect as increasing this or that chemical that provokes a physiological response.|`|7a668453967fbebc31b71b361704357baa	absolutely not; anti-depressants solely help to liberate dopamine in your brain that is blocked because of a chemical imbalance; essentially, they just help your own bio-chemistry work that way it is supposed to; of course, if you are extremely depressed, anxious or suicidal, anti-depressants will help alleviate those symptoms, which will make it easier for you to focus on your own personal values and morals, in that sense I suppose you could argue they do have an impact, but they will absolutely not change any values or moral, although they may help you get back in touch with your real self, if that has been clouded by extreme depression, anxiety, loss of concentration, thoughts of suicide, etc...|`|f0ef8b43cb69a0c2243da2859adffc87aa	Of course they do.    Rather, they help you live up to your morals and values, since we all do stupid stuff when we're depressed.  After we do the stupid stuff when we're depressed, we go down the hole a little further, where we do even stupider stuff.    Look at it this way -- many things thought to be "immoral" are, or can be, the result of depression:  suicide, drug use, alcohol abuse, sexual acting out, violence... the list goes on.  It's not that we change our moral beliefs, but when one is very depressed it is very easy to slip into these things.      Our judgement of ourselves, others and the world around us looks a lot better when we get treatment too.  We become better parents, better spouses, better employees / employers, all of which have a moral aspect.        .|`|AA11339006	great answer from geek above me.

I hated taking them, but I did it just to make others happy. Well, after I had enough I quit. I went through some serious withdrawls. I made it. I believe that you have to find your drug WITHIN YOU.

Get some professional help. The depression is the PROBLEM, not the SYMPTOM of your weight problem and self-esteem issues. See your doctor and talk to them about your weight and get some tips on how to be HEALTHY. Nevermind losing or gaining weight. Find out what to do about simply being a healthy person. Then ask for a referral to a therapist to help you contend with the depression problems. You'll be killing two birds with one stone, and you will become a healthier and HAPPIER person. I guarantee it.     Good luck!|`|e133d4b563c42c935ce6fdb09c30019baa	It's time to take a break from giving other people the power to ruin your life.

The bar on what is considered 'attractive' is so high now that everyone thinks they can date a model (male or female). This just isn't so.  Don't let this get you down.

Depends MAINLY what you eat and drink during evening...    Years ago I did study nutrition's affect to sleep (during evening time to start sleeping), and as a heavy coffee drinker, coffee in evening did not affect my sleep...  Tea did not (even for a while it affected) spoil my ability to sleep either...  But mug of hot chocolate kept me wake three even four hours...  (so, if parents wonder why their kids stay wake really late after drinking hot chocolate.., the answer is in what did they drink)  Glass of Coca Cola after 6 PM and I will stay up until midnight...    Lots of thoughts or worries (not only relationships but also financial issues) tend to keep peoples mind occupied while should start sleeping...    Well.., the REMEDY:  Have a big bowl of Corn Flakes (or even two bowls) during late evening...

It's obvious you wish you were with a guy you loved and it must be playing on your mind a lot more than you think, especially your subconscious mind.  Maybe you are also stressed about the year ahead with college? *hugs ya*    Being single definitely makes a difference though.  I find that whenever I am in a relationship I am a lot more calm and relaxed.  When I am single I tend to get worked up and frustrated much more easily.  I guess it's no surprise that studies show that those in a relationship live longer than singletons.    What I find helps is working out at the gym, meditating and spending a lot of time with friends doing the things I enjoy.   The gym for me is a very good stress buster.  I always leave feeling much more relaxed after a good work out.|`|ce9pMwKMaa	physcial excercise, meditation and deep breathing.  also keep a schedule - go to sleep and wake at the same time.    if you feel like sleeping all day then do so - that may not be recommended but if you are not getting 8 hrs every night you just might need it.

Sadly, just the thought of hurting their families does not make them want to quit, in fact often times it makes it harder.  At some point they just need to be cut off from family ties to let themselves get down to rock bottom. Often they will be mortified where they have gotten themselves to and it pushes them to seek help. This doesn't however mean they won't relapse.  Your family may want to seek help in the form of going to Al-Anon meetings. They are meetings designed for families affected by an alcoholics spouse, parent, friend, or child. They really do help families cope with this disease. Here is their website http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/english.h... . Good Luck!|`|PN5wdj9Daa	there is no known cure for alcoholism.  It is a life threatening disease that effects the families and loved ones and makes them just as sick sometimes.  It is no respector of persons...young, old, rich, poor, famous, unknown...strikes equally and kills. First the spirit then the mind and then the body.  Some alcoholics will do anything to get their drug...even sell themselves or their loved ones.  this is the horror of this disease.  The alcoholic can be a great gal/guy but do terrible things.  Then the guilt and shame drives them back to the bottle.  It is a vicious cycle.  You might want to educate yourself about this disease by reading the book: Alcoholics Anonymous available free at www.alcoholicsanonymous.org.  If you want to help yourself and your family get well then I would suggest Alateen, Alatot and Alanon which you can check out at www.al-anon.org  If you find that your family can come to an agreement and raise the money, you can hire an interventionist or get one from your local treatment center to come for free and set up a bonafide family intervention on your uncle. But before you do that, take care of yourself!!  I know it sounds strange, but this disease can kill you too and you don't even have to take a drink!|`|AtXoQlY3aa	You can't cure an Alcoholic. Nobody can. Only the Alcoholic can make themselves stop.
MXYWSsM7aa	You've got some pretty good answers here, Zain. What I would do however is go to www.WebMD. They have been pretty helpful with my health questions. I'll pray for you. God can wipe out diabetes even in your whole family. The power of prayer goes a long way. God Bless.|`|AA11132502	In manycases, diabetes can be avoided by:    1)  Eat healthy!  Limit or avoid refined sugars and carbs.  Enjoy 100% whole grain pastas and breads instead of regular white flour. Lots of fresh veggies and good proteins.     2)  Keep active!  Regular activity and scheduled exercise are a must.      3)  Keep your weight under control!  By following the important eating and activity suggestions, you will help control you weight.  Being overweight is a huge contributor to becoming a diabetic.    |`|WrUTuQdlaa	Keeping your weight in the lowest range for age-height.  Exercise on daily basis.|`|DCspHZE1aa	My father told me to never get old. I'm pretty sure that's one excellent way to avoid diabetes.  .|`|Sozc3MyFaa	IN a certain regard, if its in your cards to get diabetes, you are going to get it.  However, exercising to keep you weight within the normal range, and a sensible diet (not a crazy diet!) that is balanced nutrition will help immensely. Be sure and get a physical exam each year and tell your provider diabetes runs in the family so they can be vigilant about checking. Be sensible--don't get crazy with schemes as they can often do more harm than good!|`|AA12074640	You're already on your way to good preventative measures. Sugars and other sweets are things you will need to avoid. The earlier you start being aware, the better will be the results. Learn about artificial sweeteners. I use stevia to sweeten my English tea.    You might want to read the book "Glory Enough for All," I think is the title, about the discovery of diabetes. It was a medical mystery for a long time until some Canadian doctors began the search. One of the first diagnosed patients lived a long life because her diet was closely monitored by one of the doctors.
kQ6x5Mokaa	LOL a lot of girls are overly self conscious about that, like A LOT. That ranks up there with my boobs are too small and my thighs are too big.|`|AEAxZEveaa	Yes, it is very normal to be pungent around the time your period comes. First of all, make sure you're not washing with an anti-bacterial soap, strong soaps, scented soaps, really anything that can be harsh. Use an unscented glycerine soap on your vaginal are. That will disturb the normal flora. Second, I would see your doctor and talk it over with them. You might have an infection that you don't know about (bacterial vaginosis causes an odor).|`|I40iBJdHaa	many girls are self conscience about it. but trust me, if you don't have an infection or anything, then it's just your natural scent. it's actually a turn on for guys, as long as it isn't insanely strong. i use those always wipes!|`|i3pn4jNcaa	well if your std free then thats just your smell. everyone is different. its not your fault. if it botheres you that bad just try to discretly wash up before sex so it wont make you self consious|`|B4a6tWmcaa	an odor is normal...everybody smells different...when we I clean my vagina don't have a smell its like water but after hours and hours if i sweat down there a small comes but its not a stank smell...|`|79JpcfrXaa	Nothing too bad, but I know when I go down on my girl its after she showers.

AA11020187	The test came back high because she still has cancer. She will have cancer the rest of her life. Once breast cancer has spread to distant sites it cannot be stopped it can only be slowed down. She has had cancer twice, once in each breast. When cancer was found in her lung and hip those were still her first breast cancer. It is impossible to know what the chances of the bone scan finding something, but it is far less likely to be a new (3rd) cancer than it is metastatic disease. If the test you are referring to is a CEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen) 8 is not too elevated. This test is used to monitor how well the patient responds to treatment. Best wishes to you and your mom.|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	Well sadly I think the type of cancer she has will be terminal in the long run.  What medicine does is helps prolong the inevitable and extend the survival.    Breast cancer can be especially aggressive. Since it has returned 4 times I find it really remarkable your mother is so strong and resilient to keep combatting it. I hope that continues to be the case but you have to know that someday, the fight will be lost.    Never stop hoping.  You know there are berries like the acai berry and blueberries and others which are great antioxidants.  I just think anything that helps the body rid itself of toxins is good. I mean chemo really is toxic.  You have to be careful though even with natural products that they dont interfere with the meds she takes so always run things by the doctor.    Good luck.

yDJiiqcsaa	I don't have a "thing" for BBW in particular but not turned off either - it depends on the person - some women just have a charisma about them. They exude sexuality and glow with certain vibrancy.   The other - I have to admit having a very definite "thing" for pregnant women - they are simply scrumptious.  That is the epitome of femininity.  They have a glow about them that is thrilling.  The best sex in my life, without ANY doubt was about 12 hours before my daughter was born. She was huge and horny and it was fantastic. I think that it also helped to facilitate delivery as she got so relaxed and satisfied.  No question - it was the best.  I would swim through a pool of burning gasoline to repeat that episode. It was thrilling.  Thanks for reminding me of one of the best memories of my life.|`|abb886581ffcf2d8bf185b206f80f441aa	Well, just that they feel totally experienced... sense of comfort that way I would say...

DzHB8z6Yaa	Step 1: Brush and floss regularly to reduce or prevent stains.     Step 2: Try whitening toothpastes. Though heavily advertised, these only partially whiten teeth and don't provide a complete remedy. Make sure the toothpaste has the American Dental Association (ADA) seal of approval and has been clinically proved to whiten teeth effectively. Very few whitening toothpastes have undergone any type of clinical trial, and ones that are too abrasive can damage teeth or make them very sensitive.     Step 3: Get regular dental cleanings, which remove many food and tobacco stains. No amount of cleaning will remove the severe staining left by tetracycline or systemic disease because these pigments lie inside the tooth; you'll have to take more aggressive measures against these.     Step 4: Consider the two options, in-office and at-home treatments, for bleaching your teeth. A dentist performs in-office treatments by coating the teeth with a bleaching agent, then using periodic flashes of light to activate the solution. Treatments last 30 to 60 minutes, and the complete procedure often requires several appointments. In at-home treatments, patients wear a mouth guard fitted with bleaching gel 2 hours a day for two weeks, depending on the severity of staining.     Step 5: Think about getting veneers, which are custom-made shells bonded to the teeth with resins. This procedure often requires removing a small amount of tooth structure and is the most invasive, as well as the most expensive, treatment option.    OR YOU CAN TRY STRAWBERRIES! ( Natural way)    You need:  1 ripe strawberry  1/2 teaspoon baking soda    Directions: Crush the strawberry to a pulp, then mix with the baking soda until blended. Use a soft toothbrush to spread the mixture onto your teeth. Leave on for 5 minutes, then brush thoroughly with toothpaste to remove the berrybaking soda mix. Rinse. (A little floss will help get rid of any strawberry seeds.) Carrel says you can apply once a week.|`|1rmq0vHAaa	lemon juice|`|hXYjkCGpaa	Baking soda and strawberries are two options, but you have to beware of damaging your enamel.

Works great and its cheaper than buying some of the brands of toothpaste that contain baking soda.    Second, what is causing the teeth to be stained?  Many people drink sodas, tea, or coffee.  Or smoke cig.  All of which stain the teeth.    My dentist once told me that he can tell the difference between someone who drinks sodas as oppose to someone who drinks "sodas and tea".  He said the same thing happens with coffee and the other items mentioned above.  It seems that when they combine in your mouth, they make a darker and harder to clean stain.|`|52cx6Rxbaa	baking soda|`|3ed9d88f3042cdb93a97abb642d8268aaa	Baking soda and strawberries!

i4ceTwqLaa	My ex-boyfriend, a soldier who spent time on several missions had a favorite saying.    "There are no atheists in a foxhole".    I like that saying. It's amazing how much more meaning and profoundness life has when we imagine we might lose it.    Personally, the only proof I need that the universe and God are a whole lot more complex and knowledgable than I could ever know is to look around. A design more complicated than all of human creation combined. Every atom infinite, and every moment in time infinite. What a big, giant, beautiful, scary thing life is. And here we are, microscopic little miracles, tumbling out for a second onto this continuuum, just long enough to be terrified by the idea of our own existence before slipping back into it....    When I had a near death experience I already had some belief in God. Having a near death experience just made it even easier, I guess.    Unfortunately, I can't lay hands on you like that really old vampire in Twilight and just show you what I know. But it would be nice if I could. Instead, I'll just have to settle for some people with whom I can relate. And some people, sadly, eager to tell me how much they "know" about my near-death-experience, and how certain they are that there is no God and no heaven.     Must be nice to have such thorough Omniscience. To know that no corner of the universe contains a breath of life or a creator, and to know without doubt exactly how this life will end.    I don't claim to know all that. I just know in my heart when I look at my children that we are not merely corpses that are briefly animated, who flash across the sky like lightening, only to transform into nothingness.     I will never, ever believe that. How could life even make sense if I did?|`|wleTmTNLaa	Hey,Im scared about Dec.2012.supposably the end of the world or something like that,I just cant think that we only have three more years.Is not weird but try not to think about it.Take life to the fullest|`|zIhScEPSaa	i'm exactly like you! dude. okay sorry, but i start shaking when i think about it.  anyways. see with me, i'm pretty sure i'm going to live forever. by the time i get older, they're going to find a way to cure a LOT of things, especially with this stem-cell research. if you live in a bad neighborhood, get out, that helps you not get shot.  just think about that you'll probably live forever. i know my generation will.|`|WXExyAlWaa	Most people are scared to die. Partly because we have no way of knowing for sure what comes after - there are stories about people coming back from being medically dead and seeing bright lights and having a feeling of euphoria, but many scientists say that this is the effect of your brain shutting down, so really it's all theoretical.|`|edaWzdRDaa	It is a very sketchy topic, life and death.  Accept Jesus Christ as your personal saviour and shelter.  Believe in him with all of your heart and try to bring the best of life before death.  Death is inevitable and untimely.

ipAeBmnoaa	First of all you HAVE to warm up your lower body with a short jog of about 50 feet. Then you will go into squats start with 10 at a time, when you've worked up to approximately 30 at a time (it is acceptable to hold onto a chair back or rail for balance) you will want to work on your gluteus maximus, your butt, muscles.  You can get yourself an inexpensive workout mat for any floor exercises.  While lying on the mat, with your hands under your head, you will place your feet on the wall, about 6 inches apart, with your gluts about 18-24 inches from the wall, depending on your height, and push against the wall to raise your hips up as high as you can, tightening your butt muscles as you raise your hips, hold for a count of 5 and work yourself up to 60 seconds. Remembering to keep those muscles tight.  You see, most people think that jumping is all about your leg muscles, it's not.  After you have those two down and are not in pain when you're done, you will want to work on your thighs, hamstrings, and knees.  This requires equipment, preferably barbells.  If you don't own or can't borrow any, make 'em.  Using an old broom or mop handle and to each end use the old stand-by......DUCT tape, get yourself two gallon milk jugs, fill them with sand or stones, tape them to the mop handle and you're set.  Putting your "barbells" behind your neck and across your shoulders, place one foot approximately two feet in front of the other, again make the distance proportionate to your height, and push your body forward to the front foot, hold that position for 5 seconds, then reverse to the other foot.  Each of these exercises should be repeated 5-10 times to start.  It is VERY important not to over-do it during the first week to avoid a very painful injury.  After you have become comfortable with each exercise, you will find that not only are your legs stronger, but (no joke intended) but so will be your butt.  A lot of people don't realize how important those muscles are in a vertical jump.    These are exercises I made up for myself when I was very young and poor, so I had to "make" my own weights out of whatever was handy.  I'm now 63 years old and everyone comments on my "beautiful legs", so you can imagine the muscle tone they will give to a man.

We enjoy seeing hot naked women doing anything sexual because we don't need love, romance or anything. A women's body turns us on.

We think differently and it makes the world work and neither of us will ever understand why the opposite sex thinks the way it does. It's just the way we are.|`|a499884662fa57a7be95d9e42c7ff638aa	It kind of helps if men think about sex about every 7 seconds.|`|10mOHSZTaa	It's not something girls would understand. It's not marketed to us. Why do many women read romance novels? It's the same thing.    Guys are very visual creatures. Porn is visual and it appeals to them.    A healthy guy knows that porn is not real. He doesn't expect his girlfriend to be like girls in porn, and odds are he wouldn't like it if she was. He doesn't spend all of his time fantasizing about women in porn; in fact, he probably doesn't remember the last girl he saw in a porn movie or pic, unless it was 10 minutes ago. Given the chance he would not cheat on his girlfriend with a porn actor.    It's a form of male fantasy which is perfectly healthy for the vast majority of men. Some people have addictive personalities, and some of those people get addicted to porn. Others get addicted to alcohol, food, or a number of any other things. Most guys will not get addicted to porn.    More importantly, porn is not supposed to replace relationships. Men do fall in love, do have feelings, and do appreciate romance. At the same time, sometimes they're just horny and need some quick gratification. Women are no different.    I've watched a small amount of porn. I don't think it's degrading, but I do think it's incredibly goofy. Honestly, I was trying hard to not laugh. My boyfriend likes it, and I have to say that that really doesn't bother me at all. He's happy with me and he doesn't go for porn that would bother me -no violence or anything- so I don't see why I should intrude on his private life.    Besides, there are porn studios run by women...and wasn't the sexual revolution all about empowering women to go out and do whoever and whatever they wanted? Why is it that all of a sudden the same feminist movement is pushing for chastity? I wouldn't want to be in a porn movie, so I won't be. It's not too difficult.|`|NwGDlZl1aa	i don't get it either my Friends never stop talking about it and its weird because I'm 16 and i have never even looked at porn. i think they all do it because that's what everyone else is doing. ya|`|kgBQF4JXaa	i don't know, i actually don't like porn|`|bZe2bSMdaa	Men don't need love or emotion, they just need sex!

r7iZ2JOUaa	Hey there,     Since you do not know why you are depressed, you most probably have chemical imbalance(s) in your brain. Your diagnosis with ADHD explains why you are unable to focus for just 2 minutes and the OCD explains why you imagine the people you love are dead (intrusive thoughts).     I understand that loneliness hurts. People around you may not understand you. However, it is your choice whether to lead a joyful life or not. You can pull yourself up from this dark pit you are in. If your doctors did not prescribe you with medicine and just basically leave you hanging after diagnosis, then they are not professionals at all.     Try consulting your school counselor and ask for a referral to a therapist or psychologist. Where are you from? You may want to Google for any help around your area. Pick yourself up. You can do it. If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to email me from my profile. I am 16 years old and have depression as well as OCD, who knows what other disorders. But please, I think that your school counselor would be a good start :)|`|e3c2ed462851c4c6d6796055b93e6970aa	teen ager|`|ccFeMoFbaa	You sound like a very depressed, yet normal teenager. You are going through the most awkward time in your life right now and it is normal to feel sad and alone. I know because I was once in your shoes. You should ask your parents to take you to a therapist, sometimes they can help. If you are having problems at home, you can always go to a school counselor. One thing that helped me was to focus on the things that I enjoyed doing. I loved to read, it was like an escape from the real world. Please get some help, there is hope for you!|`|BiNCwoOiaa	There porb is but i really do feel srry for u and not in the put down kind of way|`|MMF1YmZZaa	You are not a freak, you are depressed. I am 25 years old and I really wish I could go back in time and talk to 13 year old me! I would say "Babe, you ain't seen nothing yet!" You are so young, I know that all your feelings literally start to feel like they are crushing you, but there is light at the end of this tunnel I swear!    Is there anyone you trust you can talk to? Mom, Dad, a special Aunt or cousin? Your favorite neighbor? You need to tell someone how you are feeling, and cutting yourself is not going to help anything! You are going to be OK, this is a great life, you just need to get through this hard period of time. Life isn't all flowers and happy times. But memories of happy times can get you through hard times. Happy times are worth rough times. Please talk to someone, please do it for you! Don't let depression hurt you any longer! Wouldn't it be great if you could just feel happy? You honestly can, I swear to you---you can. But right now you need to ask for help!    Good luck!|`|YP4JyPlgaa	i think you're a normal teenager with too much stress, or you might be at the age when you just dont give a f***. i dont know you so i'm not gonna try to tell you how you are. i do know that this sounds alot like i used to be and occassionally act sometimes even now. i can tell you a few things that didnt work for me. drugs... made me feel terrible in the long run and i really regret being a cokehead and somewhat of a heroin addict and alcohol made it alot worse. pot seemed to calm me down but i dont recommend it. like i said, drugs got me through, but i think they did alot more damage then good. its cliche i know, but 3 of the 4 of my really good friends i grew up with turned to drugs. one died a few years back from an overdose, my used to be best friend held a gun to my head thinking i was a narc, and the last one just went to prison for dealing heroin. the fourth one is going to college like me and is on his way to becoming a business major. sorry for the life story but i felt like writing it down cuz it helps me release some stress just gettting it out.     i was prescribed antidepressants (effexor xr) and antianxiety (xanax) awhile ago and was on them for about 4 months. they caused ALOT more damage then good. i would cut myself just because pain was the only feeling i could perceive anymore. they made act like i never wanted to act, and think like i didnt have a mind. it was almost impossible to be sad which was great, but it was impossible to be happy at the same time. i was perfectly content with being mindless and cutting myself to feel human.     i decided to drop everything about a year ago. no more drugs (legal and illegal) which includes no alcohol. i still smoke cigarettes but i'm going to quit because my lungs hate me :). i went cold turkey with everything and almost instantly i felt more like myself. i have good days and bad days like everyone else, but the ups are defenitely better then the downs.    that was basically my teenage angst/drug phase which lasted alot longer then i thought it would.    i failed almost every class in highschool, not because i was dumb, but because in my mind it was pointless because honestly i didnt think i was going to live past 19. i imagined killing myself or being killed almost everyday. writing this right now brings back some dark memories and its strange reflecting on it because thats not at all how i am today. i just turned 21 about a month ago.    like i said, i didnt care about highschool at all... i hated it actually... but afterwards i somehow got accepted to the university of new mexico and thats where things changed. i lived in the dorms and being constantly forced into social situations changed my personality. i met someone new everyday through someone i just met the day before and it kept on going. i forgot about my own problems and just started enjoying life. i moved OUT of my hometown to a albuquerque, a city atleast 20x my hometown. this, i think, was the best thing i could of done. change everything.    i hate to say im a statistic and had too much fun in college and had to drop out because i lost my scholarship and i couldnt afford tuition. it was another incredibly difficult period filled with despair when i came back to my hometown. i did become alot more interested in educating myself while i was at unm though... maybe it was because i didnt think i was going to die anymore... or i realized i hadnt died and i needed to get on with life... i dont know the reason, but for some reason i suddenly became focused on learning as much as i could! probably to make up for all the lost time in my teenage years of just not caring.     so i made it back to my hometown, and i am living with the rentals right now. in part because i was depressed because i had lost my scholarship and had to move away from the city that i loved and had to find myself again, and because i was BROKE. i enrolled in a community college here, and hated it at first because it reminded me of highschool. there were no dorms on campus. i had no social life anymore, and i was forced to reflect on how i fucked everything up, which put me in a terrible state of mind. my problems came back to me... they'll ALWAYS catch up to you if you let them.    so i did what i could to take the focus away... this was the part i started taking the antideppresants (effexor xr) and antianxiety (xanax)* medication. luckily it was mostly over the summer when there was no school so i didnt fail any classes in my 4 months of nothingness.      those obviously didnt help me how i hoped they could, turned to drugs again, and then like i said earlier... woke up one day, and stopped doing everything cold turkey. you cant take something away you have been used to for so long without filling the gaps. i filled the hole i left when i quit drugs, with school and committed myself to education.    this isnt just education within the college from 8a.m. to 8 p.m. because my urge to take drugs didnt just last from 8-8.|`|f9crUDTwaa	Yeah the condition is called being a teenager...

In all lkelihood, you are suffring from a mjor depressive disorder. the illness is caused by an imbalance in neurochemical transmitters in the brain. There are many available medications, but you need to find the one that effective for you. you also need to wait for some time for the full effect to kick in. You also need psychotherapy of some sort to improve your coping skills so you don't readily fall into severe depressive episodes and to avoid suicidal tendencies...Don't hesitate to seek consult with a doctor...it will help...if one doctor isn't helping..go seek another...    I don't believe you are a freak and i don't believe that its a personality problem. For one you are still 13 years old, and personalities are supposed to have been fully ingrained at late adolescence or early adulthood. so not yet... you are no freak...you are ill...better seek treatment...

zlBnEwrsaa	I think that it's awesome you're following all of your passions in this way.  I think if anything, you'll be well rounded.  This can be helpful in your career, as you'll have mobility to move between different fields if you choose to do so.  Or, perhaps you could do both types of work at the same time - be a dental hygienist and teach anthropology part time.  You could even combine the two fields of study and be like a forensic anthropologist (studying the dental remains of fossilized humans to learn how dental health was back a long time ago).    You are beautiful my friend.  Good luck!  And remember, it's what you make of it.
sCKegnDSaa	Sleep helps the body rest and restore itself. It sort of similar to putting a battery on charge.    Without sleep you can become ill, weak and can become a danger to yourself and others around you.     I say this because your body is much less focused, self aware and stable. Your mind cannot function properly due to lack of sleep.    You need sleep!|`|KhS39gLqaa	sleep is a way to let your mind rest and sort things out. soon you'll be getting VERY irritable, maybe you already are.. i don't think that you're proving that we can go without sleep, you're just proving that you have great will power. if you aren't a complete dipshit, you'll go to sleep|`|en9Xk0h2aa	If you go long enough with literally NO sleep you die.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep Sleep...|`|d9cB8yN8aa	Wow!

I hope you aren't taking something to keep you awake.     I think you need to go to the EMERGENCY ROOM or WALK-IN CLINIC or your REGULAR DOCTOR for help because this is very dangerous being without sleep for 3 days and it sounds like you don't plan on sleeping anytime soon.     Please get help.        Here's some hints to help you sleep for the future:    Stay away from any caffeine drinks or chocolate candy as that will keep you awake. I very seldom drink caffeine except tea sometimes so I am very sensitive to caffeine and can't sleep at night if I have any later than 3 in the afternoon.    Take a hint from nature and notice how the sun goes down gradually getting dark a little at a time. We should start preparing for bed gradually also. Turn off the computer monitor, your t.v., your cellphone and overhead lights to allow it to begin getting darker an hour before bedtime. Don't use the overhead light in your room before bedtime instead use a lamp.    Use a nightlight in your bathroom to help keep you in the sleep mode.    Do something that keeps you calm and allows you to relax before bed like reading a book. Reading will make me sleepy every time. You might try a hobby that is relaxing.    Try drinking a small glass of milk about 30 minutes to an hour before bedtime as milk has natural vitamins and minerals that help you relax. If you don't drink milk, then try some cheese and crackers or a cheese toast, and a small snack will keep your blood sugar level through the night.    If you have worries or troubles that you can't solve, write them down and tell yourself you can't solve it tonight so you will think about the answer tomorrow when it is daytime.     Try saying a prayer or reading your Bible. I heard Oprah say she does both to help her when she is nervous or worried. She talks about reading the Psalms.   See even a millionaire has worries and troubles so as humans we are all the same. It's all in how we handle those troubles that makes the difference.    Hope you will soon have peaceful restful sleep.|`|uMTF3HXcaa	Well u should sleep cuz its gonna drain ur body. And mess with ur imune system.

YCl1FGBOaa	Lucky for you, I don't think it's a pull. However, if you try to push your hamstrings past what they are capable of, it will become a pull or possibly even a tear. I would suggest doing a couple different remedies. First, ice on for 20 minutes, ice off for 15 minutes, ice on for 20, off for 15, etc. for as long as you can do.  Something I've found to help with muscle soreness or strains is vitamin C and papaya or pineapple enzymes, take some of those and it will speed up the process. If the muscle is bothering you throughout the day (when you are walking or sitting down) take some ibuprofen. Stay off your hamstring for about 5 days and try going back to the sport/ working out slowly, and apply icy hot and a heat pad, and a lot of stretching (jog for about 15 minutes and stretch a lot) before you excersize.   Do not do not do not try to push your boundaries before it is comfortable. You could end up being injured without being able to run at all for 2 or more months if you get a pull/tear.   Good luck, and believe me, if you push it and pull it, you will regret it, and thinkg "Why did I try to push it before it was ready"|`|jK9yiQq6aa	massage, ice pack, hot bath. in that order

aFzqYyLSaa	muscle milk is alright to drink. Best when drank on work out days. The best ways guys like to get toned are to work their arms (bench press with a buddy) do curls, and work on the abs (the best way is to do sit ups or crunches on a bench with a tilt. Your head goes at the lower end and your ankles hang on to the higher end. (another way is to do sit ups with medicine balls [heavy balls 5-10lbs] and toss them to a partner when coming up for the sit up). Also aerobic excesses is good for burning the fat. So running/joggin or sports play or rough housing (basically working up a sweat and keeping your heart rate up). Should help. Last,  is to work your muscles every other day or less so they have time to rebuild. It's a faster way to get muscle.|`|1ZZ2iemcaa	no supplements.... i would stay away from them as much as possiable. Only thing you should look towards is whey protien. But before that you need to have a ballanced diet and a workout plan.    IF u need more advice pm me.    good luck
UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.    When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat.     The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...|`|PWIjeHmQaa	run and eat healthy

14c27365c493c71e231d66169204e78faa	You can drink lots of fluids the day before and the day of your blood donation. Liquids which are low in sugar (water, unsweetened teas) should thin your blood down and potentially make your blood run faster. Other than that, keep relaxed during the process and the tension in your arm shouldn't hinder any blood flow.    Bending your arm, or keeping your muscles tense will slow down the procedure because tense muscles constrict blood vessels limiting the flow of blood to that region of the body. Tension in even the smallest muscles in the face can spread down to the neck and shoulders making it more difficult for blood to spread wherever else it needs to go.    Keeping totally still doesn't help either since it's not the natural funtion of the body to lay still. If you know any immobilized patients, you know they also need to excercise to get the blood flowing to different parts of the body, and gain proper muscles. So, flexing and stretching the muscles, rubbing/massages to the skin or deep tissues, as well as pinching or patting, and deep breathing excercises will increase blood flow and circulation.    But remember not to get too over worked! Don't do any jumping jacks or pushups right before or anything because you'll be passed out by the time you leave.     A lot of the blood they take from your body has just been replaced with "new" oxygenated blood by the lungs, -think of it as your body trying to maintain a constant stream of new blood to your extremities, as the old blood comes in to get oxygenated. So, if you are out of breath when you're on the blood chair, you'll be donating all the nicely oxygen-filled blood, depleating your supply to other important organs such as, say, the brain -which could cause you to pass out/become light-headed.    So basically, some light excercise with relaxed muscles, and lots of fluids should get you out of there quickly to get back to the rest of your day! Oh, and don't forget to take some deep breaths too!    Have fun donating! haha|`|jPIyZRTqaa	Aspirin is supposed to thin your blood, but I don't think you'd provide a very good sample if you did this.

U8QQkeQ4aa	take the prego test a couple days before the period...    Plan B can make you spot bleed, have a heavy period...etc  It can do all sorts of things to your cycle.  Don't panic just yet...wait it out.  You are probably okay.    You can take any pregnancy test 5 days before your period. Do it in the morning, there is a higher concentration of the pregnancy hormone.
WXExyAlWaa	I really, really doubt it. Killing yourself hurts a lot more than braces. If there was, they would have had to be pretty unbalanced to start with, so I'd say it was more because they were unbalanced than because of braces.|`|zWBYxMvWaa	jeez, braces don't hurt that much!|`|zPGin01Kaa	now i want to just cuz you said tht|`|zIhScEPSaa	no.|`|QHqPoAVSaa	Not to be funny but only that person could answer that question and it may be too late for them if they have.  I have never had them but I no tons of people that have or currently have them, kids and adults.  I have heard that they hurt but you get used to them and the only time they really hurt is when they are tightened.  Suicide is never the answer.  I feel like there is something else that you would like to ask advice on.|`|xgrNAwa1aa	At age 14 I got braces back in the 80's. We didn't have the kind that are clear, colored to look cute, or even as small as the ones made today. I had them on for 4 years. I hated them and yes, it hurt.  What you need to realize is that is now something I feel was the smallest of problems that could arise in life.  That pain and the pain that is caused by an auto accident 10yrs ago that took my career away, ability to ever work away, and a disease of the nervous system that is considered the most painful chronic pain disease known to man that has no cure.  The only time in my entire life I ever even thought of suicide was while I was on crutches for 2 1/2 years and couldn't walk. I didn't know if I would ever be able to walk again then. I couldn't drive my car, I lost friends that I thought were true because I couldn't get out anymore.  10yrs later I am doing much better even though the pain is so bad and is 24/7 non stop.   Braces was a teenage experience; nothing more or less now that I'm an adult and have experienced far worse pain both physically and mentally in my life.   I hated them and couldn't wait to get them off. You will feel the same but there is no reason to even begin to think this is the end of the world as you know it.   Once you don't care as much that you have braces and are more confident, that will show through to others around you and nobody will hardly notice as so many have to go through this.  Best Wishes|`|zxUtFM5qaa	haha no, but in my personal experience i wanted to call 911, but knowing all my friends went through this i just decided to take it even though i didnt want to. Besides the longest anybody that i know that has suffered with braces is 2 weeks tops.
iTP5CNtuaa	Ovarian cysts are very common and can quite easily become more prominent during your cycle. They can stay there for a week or a day or any span of time. They can also be focused on one side. I would recommend seeing a doctor if the pain persists for over a week or so or it increases to an unbearable point. Good luck- I hate ovarian cysts.|`|AJ38Xqyeaa	PAINNNN|`|8ZoSSslFaa	try to get through it and if it dose not go away when your period stops then go to your doctor :) good luck|`|CKpPpK0saa	well take a pamprin or advil. tylonal works the best though.    its normal, but hey we are women, its apart of us!    just breath and pretend it isnt there.
bPKLKi7haa	Maybe you are really sensitive to the environment around you, the people in your life, and your feelings and theirs. That sounds like it could be stressful at times, but maybe there's a reason for why these things happen to you. I know that when something happens, whether you think it is a gift or a curse, you can learn how to use it to your advantage. Maybe you need these skills, or abilites, or over sensitive imagination to accomplish something great in your life...|`|WXExyAlWaa	Honestly I think it's just sort of normal and in your imagination. Vivid imagination, but still imagination.
fx6TqDXqaa	If you're not exceeding the reccomended dose, you'll probably be alright. However, there are most likely long-term effects--just because science hasn't discovered them yet doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful. Imagine how you'll feel if a study about how Diphenhydramine HCl causes cancer pops up next year. In addition to that, I think you might start relying on the pills to fall asleep, and will find it very difficult to sleep without them.  Stay safe.|`|ILUYVQ0naa	Yes, there are many things that are legal that should only be done when necessary, there are many long term effects it could have, and if you are using it to get away from problems then you are just avoiding the real issues in life and you should learn to deal with them other than hiding behind meds.|`|45f427df1deeccc715106e52ff789d64aa	im 16 and use a lot of drugs. benadryl being one of them. never take more than 150mg or you will trip out bad **** but i mainly use it as a sedative and it can turn into a problem. it led me to oxycotin. so just be carefull dude not trying to bash on drugs either love um!
s0HTHGd4aa	Take Melatonin.  It's in the vitamin isle in your local store.  It's natural and non-addictive.  It works fast and well.    But......you can only do that for so long.  Treat the underlying problem which seems to be being on the Internet for so long.  Unless this is a must for school, you need to discipline yourself to shut down the computer a few hours earlier.  Then take a few Melatonin and off to sleep you will go.....    Happy ZZZZZZZZZZ'sssssssssss|`|lW2W1ApBaa	Try unwinding a couple of hours before bed time, exercise, read a good book, drink some hot coco, take a long hot bath, learn to relax.. try any or all of these, if still no avail.. see a doctor to ward off any under lining problems, stay off caffine in the evening, don't eat at least 2 hours before bedtime, and limit your computer use at night. Good Luck.|`|tn1CqxMcaa	well you can take a pill but you wont want to do that forever so you should probably just ask your doctor first

xgrNAwa1aa	It is not a physical withdrawal that you are going through when you stop taking it. It has more to do with your brain and the need for the medication to help you stay stable.   Yes, I've tapered down a lot but I've never been able to completely go off of my anti-depressant. I had many of them changed over the years because of side effects and weight gain issues. The one I'm on now I feel helps most and I hate to have to take any medications but realize I need to.   The biggest question you need to ask yourself is; are you on an anti-depressant because you have a family history of depression or was this prescribed because you had a long term need for it?  With family history it is almost impossible to ever go without any anti-depressant what so ever but maybe the one you are on that is making you physically ill when you stop needs to be changed to something less strong and I would discuss that with your doctor as that may be the only way to stop taking this kind of medication unless family history is involved.  I've been told that I will probably have to remain on some type of anti-depressant my entire life as my Grandma was treated for depression in her 40's and my Aunt is on meds too along with my Dad and Mom. My Sister has been on them for a few years now also and realizes how much it does help even though she is unhappy with the weight gain.  I too hate medications and wish I didn't have to take them but you have to evaluate your own personal situation on why you are on them to begin with and why.   At least you are able to take the lowest dose possible but I would talk to the doctor about a possible change to see if there is a way out of this but in the end, it's all up to what the doctor believes and what your personal feelings are.   The funny feeling in your head from not taking this medication will go away but always make sure that you can just stop taking something without your doctor's approval first.  Best Wishes|`|vwoqIUR6aa	ask the doc for prozac to taper off|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	I guess I am one of the lucky ones, I never have had a problem with it.

There are side effects with almost any anti depressants.  I tried to do this with Paxil  once and it was a HORRIBLE idea.  Please seek advice from your md first.  Good luck|`|Oq8G5Cvlaa	I went from 45mg. to 15mg. of Mirtazapine (generic)  But needed help from (chlordiazepoxide) 25mg. 4x daily.

No shame in that!|`|bUWWeT0Xaa	Just curious if you have prayed about it.  You are proof of why I am scared to death of anti-depressants which I think that I might need.  I took a class on managing depression and learned that sunlight helps, sleeping at night helps, avoiding caffeine and alcohol helps.  They also talked about diet changes to include your omegas like walnuts, flax seeds, tofu, and soy.  certain fish help too.  But I am not a medical expert so I am just repeating what I remembered from the classes I took on depression management.  Seriously, though have you prayed about it?    Well, I agree with talk to your doctor about ways to completely stop taking the meds that you no longer need.|`|vWEkopBQaa	Get your Doctor's advice first. He maybe able to give you something that will help ease the side effects. I am guilty of taking myself off of Paxil cold turkey without my Doctor knowing. For two weeks I had this ringing in my ears and the shakes.|`|AA12044219	Yes...Zoloft. I started by taking half a pill for a week then half a pill every other day.

wRtzGgRxaa	Gastritis is a disorder of the lining of the stomach, whereas IBS is a disorder of your colon.  Symptoms of gastritis include: nausea, vomiting, feeling of fullness, pernicious anemia.  Symptoms of IBS include: abdominal discomfort, constipation, diarrhea.  Diet changes are common in IBS treatment.  I've heard that fats have been found to start irritation in IBS, but I think a lot of your diet changes are going to be determined on your own personal recall of what triggers your episodes.|`|IzHfbWtiaa	It might be a Hernia,but for peace of mind consult with a specialist for his/her diagnoses!

YRJShhKraa	It is great that you want to seek help for your problem! That's the first step in recovery. I have been to many different psychiatrists and therapists. Your first visit will mainly be just filling out a bunch of paperwork, and answering a bunch of questions. The questions are pretty much the same for both except a psychiatrist will ask you medical questions too. So be prepared to answer lots of questions! The first visit is really just about telling about your problem and deciding if that psychiatrist/therapist is right for you. It is scary at first but you will get used to it. Good luck! Hope this helps! =)|`|r7iZ2JOUaa	The psychiatrist would of course ask you what you are dealing with and probably access your past, to try and find out the root of the problem. Psychiatrists prescribe medications. Are you comfortable with that? Or do you feel that a therapist, someone whom you can share your feelings with would be more appropriate for a start? I think that you should look for a therapist first and if he or she finds that medication will help your depression and anxiety, she will then refer you to a psychiatrist. Because I think a therapist would be able to help you with your low self-esteem better.     Anyhow, whomever you are going to see, he or she should be a professional in this field. Well done for having the courage to seek help :)
5ZKqU2sIaa	Sticking a rag in your mouth can make you gag, half way swallowing a piece of string will do the trick to!
jeztbF6naa	is stuffiness just the problem?  i would recommend you go to your local cvs or Walgreen's pharmacy and get what they call shower soothers. you just lay it in the floor of your shower and as the water runs over it, it creates a strong vapor that opens up your nose. i would also try Vick's vapor rub and just put a little under your nose not a lot where its noticeable just enough to open you up. reply back for additional help|`|jK9yiQq6aa	peppermint tea, a humidifier. bowl a pot of water and breathe in the steam|`|rJRyVZhvaa	Check out a helath food store, and ask for a Neti (or Netti) pot.  All you need is warm, not hot, water with a pinch or two of sea salt, mix well, and insert the spout into either nostril, turn your head to the side so the water can pour out of your other nostril, clearing your sinuses of mucus, dust, loose hairs, ect.  Then, repeat the process, in your other nostril.   It will feel really weird at first, but once you get the hang of using it correctly, your nose (and sinuses) will feel great, and if you swallow the water, it won't hurt you, because it's just warm salt water, and no drugs or chemicals!  Another idea is buy some loose green tea (or green tea bags- either will work effectively), steep in hot water, smell the steam from the tea, and drink (with a couple of drops of raw honey and/or lemon). You may burp, but that's fine- it's the enzymes in the tea that's helping your stomach, and your digestion.   Hope these ideas and tips help you.  All the best to you!  And good luck in your musical!|`|accdd753250739a255f532616b8c6cdfaa	For your nose get one of those little contraptions I see sold in catalogs that are white and look like watering cans, you put water in them, lean your head back and drip the water down one nostril and it is supposed to circulate through to the other nostril clearing out both nostrils.  I tried it some time ago and it really worked to clear my nose out.    If you have any chinese herb stores near you try and get something called San Chi Dan (sp) it is the most amazing thing for clearing out congestion.  I have heard it is hard to get in the   US right now for some reason, but if you can find an herbalist or accupuncturist that has some it is incredible.  I have lived on the stuff when I have had bronchitis, totally herbal.
TXlPfydxaa	The 512 isn't the amount of Ibuprofen in it, considering there is no Ibuprofen in those. That's a generic 5mg Oxycodone/325mg Acetaminophen equivalent for Percocet, and they generally go for about $2-$3 a pill, in my area|`|s0HTHGd4aa	Hmmm, I've never seen one like that.  Depends on the strength.  10's sell for about $6-9 where I live and 7.5's and lower go for about $5.    It's going to be an easy project for you if your trying to find out *why* people waste their money on pills.  They make people who aren't in pain feel good.  Honestly, ask some of your friends how much they sell for....I'm sure they'd know.|`|bQ4RAi07aa	If you are doing research contact your local drug rehab center, I'm sure they can give you statistics and advice on how to compile your selected health project.|`|aTgPnA96aa	pshh, yeah right. haha    well i'm pretty sure the 512 is the amount of ibuprofen, not the amount of the drug. but yeah, it would probably go for around $2 a pop around here. it's different in different areas though.     and it's not a waste! it makes you happy! plus it just makes everything even MORE fun then it really is! oh and the stories...damnn i got some good stories. =] hahaha

Now for your pic...For 15 years old I think you look just fine. Sure, toning more is always great for ANYONE. But don't worry about if you're too thin, because you're not.|`|7pkxOc6Raa	Yes.    And lifting at a young age does not make you stop growing, the average person is an uneducated retard. I don't know why they feel the need to contribute when they don't know ****.

People who say "you're fine the way you are" will never improve themselves. Why would you not want to be in the best physical and mental health you possibly can? It's the "you're fine the way you are" attitude that leads to obesity, laziness, jealousy, low self-esteem. You'll notice the people who say that are the ones who never get off their asses and do anything physically or mentally stimulating. You can cruise through life like them and put in no effort, if that's the kind of person you are.|`|GDreFpSdaa	You'll start filling out in your 20's.

GezRbRRJaa	well you are doing great with 18 pound lose, and the body does plateau sometimes, which is a good thing for a short time, it means your body has adjusted to what you are doing and its ready for a change up, i'm sure you have seen or heard about the backpack looking things that mom's wear to carry the baby in front of them or on their back, or get a stroller and push the baby, - walking would be a great way to get out for you and as the baby grows it would nourish your relationship with the child, and they would learn by your example that exercise / walking is good.     also -  here are some healthy tips >>     if you want to weight 180 pounds, then eat 1800 calories - good balanced diet and exercise, drink water ( minimum daily requirements is 8 - 8oz glasses)   weight 165 pounds - 1650 calories ;  weight 160 pounds - 1600 calories ;   weight 120 pounds - 1200 calories ;   basically what weight you should be and add a zero 0 , thats how many calories you should take in daily,    our bodies need a good balance of a variety of foods, a good 7 grain bread ; nuts ; raisins ; fruits ; cereals - the kinds that are not full of sugars ; green veggies ; yellow veggies ; beans / legumes ; peanut butter - a good one that's not full of sugar ; as for meats - chicken ; fish - salmon is best - tuna is also good ; beef - which has less than 20% fat content ; you can spice foods up with seasonings and make them taste better, but be very careful of how much salt you eat - always less than 3000 mg daily , if you average it to 1,000 mg per meal that would be best. And don't forget to drink your water, the water helps the body flush all the bad stuff from our system and keeps the body / organs functioning properly.     no soda pop / cokes ; coffee ; tea - unless its herbal tea ; no beer / alcohol ; no chips / cookies / cakes / pies / candy's ;     get at least 30 minutes of walking in a day - a good fast walk rather than a slow one, the average speed of a good fast walk is 4 miles an hour - so 2 miles in half an hour , but if you are not used to walking fast it will take your body time to get used to it and get that fast, and don't over do it, you don't want to pass out - set a pace, if you need to stop and take a 5 minute rest.     walking is the absolute best exercise for our bodies!    http://answers.yahoo.com/search/search_r...     thats a search here in yahoo answers about diet + lose + weight, check out what others have said.|`|Fvygkezzaa	Why don't you take your son for a stroll in the park???

AA10046659	I have had the same problem. Over this past year for some reason I have started breaking out & having lots of blackheads. It disgusts me. I researched & researched trying to find something that would work & I did find something that has worked for me. I realise it may not work for you or everyone out there. However, I bought Klear Action. I don't know if you've heard of it, but it compares to Proactiv yet it's 1/2 the price. It sales for $19.99 or that's what I bought it for at Walgreens. I'm not sure who else sales it but you can find it over the Internet. It comes with the 3 step process. You get your wash, your toner, & your lotion. It has really really cleared my skin up. I get a bump on occasion but for the most part I'm clear. My blackheads are even gone. I saw a difference & that it was working within 2 days. It wasn't all gone that quick but I saw a drastic change in my face. I wash my face twice a day in it most of the time, but there's days I only get one wash in. Also, the hot wash cloth on your face helps to open your pores.  I often do that for a few minutes BEFORE washing my face so my pores are open more.  I hope this helps.

g8NiwNKEaa	Yes it hurts, but no ways as bad as it does when you have to have them tighten. Your teeth will shift a little, but they wont if you were your retainer like you are supposed to. You can eat basically what you want, but they say not to eat "hard" foods bc that can cause your brackets to pop off, & they are the things that hurt me the most!!! You just have to be very cautious to what you eat, use your on judgment, oh & they also say that you cant chew gum either. No, I didnt lose weight when I had mine, Im not stupid, I ate whatever I wanted to, some people just are................................. not unless they needed to & they used having braces as an accentive to do so, so they'll have a great look with their great smile, see 2 for the price of 1, LOL. |`|LJmx6Qbqaa	I had braces, and it was worth it.. i had them for a TMJ disorder ( a jaw problem) . It hurts when the tighten the screws etc .... but only for a day or two then the pain goes away... i got my screws tightened about ever month i think..... i had them for 6 months altogether, although i had retainers and stuff before and after.    don't ever try to remove the braces yourself... it will screw it up cos everything will move back and there would have been no point in getting the braces... also you could damage your teeth badly.. and you wil be left with marks on your teeth (usually when the orthodontists remove them the use stuff to losen the cemen that binds them to your teeth and also clean and polish your teeth after so it looks normal again)    also yes i lost some weight because it took me soo long to eat, and it hurt to eat sometimes, and also i had to brush my teeth every time after i ate or else i would have food all through my braces. so i at less often.... i didn't lose heaps of weight though and put it back on slowly after getting my braces off.    to minimise the pain you can just take pain killers (acetominophen/paracetamol) but you get over the pain its bearable.    have you already got them or are you getting them??|`|7GiO4wqCaa	ive had braces twice, right now it is the second time ive had them  they clip them off with a special tool, it dusnet hurt getting them off but the process of having braces hurts like hellllllllllllllllllllllll  well i think so anyway.  your teeth only move back if you dont wear the retainer they give to you to wear.  you dont really get skinnier cause once you can eat, you eat heaps so you just put hte weight back on  |`|HE8XSehhaa	When I had my braces taken off it didn't hurt, but there was a very loud crunch noise when each bracket was taken off each tooth.My teeth moved just a fraction because there was a wait period before I got my retainers, but the retainers put them back where they were supposed to go. The only time I never ate normally was when I had new bands put on my teeth. My teeth hurt then so I would eat soft food for a day or so, but after that I would eat whatever I wanted. After my braces came off I ate anything I wanted, and never had any problem. I never had a problem eating so I never lost any weight.|`|yeuNhTwAaa	1. When the dentist removes the braces, they use a special tool that takes them off. it doesn't really hurt if your teeth aren't sensitive.    2. Braces don't have to hurt. People think that they always have to hurt. They may hurt for a few days, but when you get used to it, they don't hurt.    3. My teeth have moved back a whole lot. It also depends on the braces you use. The rubber band braces don't work that well as the new kind.    4. Yes. I eat like a normal person.    5. No. I haven't gotten thin.

In general, people should eat about 30% less than they could enjoyably eat, but eat only nutritious foods.  That wouldn't be very fun, but that's the best bet for longevity.  As long as the food is nutritious, you could simply eat as much as you want, but exercise enough to stay trim.  Everyone is different so I wouldn't worry too much about what the average is.  Food quality is more important, and the accumulation of fat or any other sign of overeating is your sign to back down a little.|`|e362f2a1aa626054a7f757dfab2f9bf9aa	an averge man needs 1500 calories a day and a woman needs 1200 a day at the very less|`|3369d2be7aa68e24e1d5a8097d378f3daa	Hi Shiva,     I am 33 and I notice that I can't eat as much I could when I was 30 and think this is because when you get to our age, you have to do a bit more excercise to really try and shift where the fat deposits itself on certain parts of the body     I would say that you are a healthy weight at 52 Kililograms for your height, but if you want to lose weight, I would recommend eating little and often rather than eating main meals as this slows down the food processing in order for your body to digest food a lot better.    Eating wholemeal bread, baked potatoes and brown rice dishes are all foods that will eliminate toxins and will regulate your body to rid you of excess calories.  Vegeatbles and nuts will also do the trick.      Cutting out sugar and salt is what is going to help you have a normal body weight because these two things are what keeps the weight on and they can be found in all processed foods and in cakes, buiscuits, crisps and microwaved meals.  Use olive-oil instead of margarine or fat spreads - these are sure to put weight on anyone.    Drinking plenty of water a day will also rid the body of excess toxins that are stored and what causes fat from the sugar and salt we consume.  Try to gradually introduce these foods into your diet rather than force yourself to eat healthily as you will give up far too soon. Small changes to the diet really does help.    Eating more of these whole foods will keep your weight at the weight it should be and won't allow you to put any more on.  They are also a lot more filling and there is no restrictions upon how much you can eat as you will know when you are full.  The water will also let you know when you are hungry or thirsty as often we mistake hunger for thirst.    Your weight sounds quite healthy and okay and you are lighter than me, but I am a little taller.  I wouldn't try to get into the calorie-counting buisness because you will become obsessed eventually.  I would just eat as many healthy foods as you can and drink more water and take regular excercise as that is what is going to keep your weight stable more than calorie counting.    Also, junk foods such as microwave meals and all processed cheap foods are full of salt and sugars and why you never feel full up even after eating them because they make people addicted to the flavorings and salt, craves more salt.    This is my best advice to you.|`|3c96186d0a9e0b18944f7d97a9f04634aa	Calories:       Daily caloric needs to maintain weight   note: kg = pounds divided by 2.2 (ie: 180 lbs / 2.2 = 81.8 kg)     Approximation:     >Men  kg (body weight) x 24 = kcal/day       These calculations do not take physical activity, medical conditions, or age into consideration... for a more accurate estimate of caloric needs - the following equations are used:     note:  kg = pounds divided by 2.2 (ie: 180 lbs / 2.2 = 81.8 kg)  cm =  inches multiplied by 2.54 (ie: 68 inches x 2.54 = 173 cm)     Harris-Benedict equations:     Men:  BMR = 66 + (13.7 x wt in kg) + (5 x ht in cm) - (6.8 x age in yrs)     Women:  BMR = 655 + (9.6 x wt in kg) + (1.8 x ht in cm) - (4.7 x age in yrs)       Other BMR (basal metabolic rate) formulas   BMR without exercise:  note: (wt = body weight in kg)        Sex and Age BMR Equation (kcal/day)   Males    0-3 yrs (60.9 x wt) - 54   3-10 yrs (22.7 x wt) + 495   10-18 yrs (17.5 x wt) + 651   18-30 yrs (15.3 x wt) + 679   30-50 yrs (11.6 x wt) + 879   over 60 yrs (13.5 x wt) + 487         Females    0-3 yrs (61.0 x wt) - 51   3-10 yrs (22.5 x wt) + 499   10-18 yrs (12.2 x wt) + 746   18-30 yrs (14.7 x wt) + 496   30-60 yrs (8.7 x wt) + 829   over 60 yrs (10.5 x wt) + 596      To include exercise - multiply BMR by the appropriate activity factor:    Level Type Of Activity Factor   Very light :Cooking, driving, ironing, painting, sewing, standing 1.3 men  1.3 women   Light Walking 3 MPH, electrical trades, sailing, golf, child care, housecleaning 1.6 men  1.3 women   Moderate Walking 3.5-4.0 MPH, weeding, cycling, skiing, tennis, dance 1.7 men  1.6 women   Heavy Manual digging, basketball, climbing, football, soccer 2.1 men  1.9 women   Exceptional  Training for professional athletic competition 2.4 men  2.2 women|`|1b41331da1c77e849a5352b56d9e3f4eaa	Healthy food for weight control    You know diet pills; liquid meals and unusual combinations of foods are not the things, which are going to help in controlling you weight and managing your in the long run. The thing, which is going to help, is the variety of healthy food you eat.    While going for a new eating style, try to lower the calorie you consume as that is going to help you in weight loss. But lessening calories does not mean decreasing taste, contentment or even simplicity of food preparation. The best way of decreasing calories intake is by trying more plant based foods like fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Go for range to facilitate you get your goals without compromising taste or nutrition. Cutting back on calories is easier if you focus on limiting fat.  For losing weight, talk to your doctor about setting these daily calorie goals:      Your weight     Daily calorie      Daily calorie  (Pounds)         (Women)             (Men)  250 or less       1,200               1,400  251 to 300        1,400               1,600  301 or more       1,600               1,800      With time, I think your calorie needs may change depending upon the how much weight loss you desire and your health risks. In case you have got your weight loss target or feel too much hungry, you can increase your calories intake.    Very low calorie diets aren't a healthy long-term strategy. Less than 1,200 calories a day for women and 1,400 calories for men aren't normally suggested. If your calories are too low, you run the risk of not getting all of the nutrients you need for good health.    It's usually best to talk to your doctor before starting any weight-loss plan. A weight-loss specialist can help guide you in making the healthiest, most effective and safest food choices based on your individual needs.

I trained horses for years and that part of me is out of proportion to the rest.  Sorry to say, I have found that exercise can target toning up which can result in some loss but diet cannot.  Unfortunately for us hippy  and big leg girls, the way you lose and gain weight is set into the genetic code of your body.  If I diet I will lose it from Everywhere else in my body before it reaches my thighs.  You have to lose ANY weight you might have around your face, neck, waist stomach, arms and lower legs before it will show loss on your thighs.  All my  ribs will stick out and I will still have big thighs.   Exercise like tae bo or pilates or running, all of which target the legs have worked best for me.   A low carb diet actually made my thighs get bigger.  I am a normal to thin size lady too and active.  It's a female spot for storing weight in case of famine, so it will not come off until you almost starve yourself if done by diet.    Sorry, that is what I have learned through studying up on it for years.|`|AA11663862	I had the same problem but around my abs. No amount of cardio or exercise got off that belly fat.

809224dcd9fc569fcfea52fc3bbe4cf0aa	Ah, your first time...I remember my first time.  It was with some friends at my apartment drinking beer.  Someone fixed me a line the size of a needle, I took a piece of straw and just snorted away.  My first impression was, wow, this is gonna keep me up, also, try to have a few beers in you prior to doing it, it helps the effect, and it'll sober you up in a sec.  Right after the hit, you'll feel the inside of your nose getting numb, which will make beer taste like heaven, then after like a minute, coke will make its way down your throat.  This will be when you'll get the actual hit, it tastes like crap the first time, real bitter, but you get used to the taste quick, maybe a little too quick.  Drainage, as this moment is called, will also numb your throat all the way to the stomach, then beer will taste even better (if that was even possible).  You will feel energized, wide awake, and will want to do things.  Have a cigarette afterwards, it'll be the best cigarette you'll ever smoke.  Keep it small on your first time, do like a small tiny little line for every hour you party.  Then stop about an hour before you know the party will be over, and whatever you do, don't stop drinking, unless you want to be up for another 8 hours after the party is over.  Blow can be fun if you don't get hooked on it.  This is hard to do, since it's expensive, but once you start planning your finances around it, you'll know it became a habit.  Don't get hooked, enjoy!|`|81853bb1499c0ba1c3cc5eea0b54c6c6aa	Its like a super caffein high almost, you feel invicible and everything is just hightened like ur floating through life|`|AA11978290	Well if you are going to do it, then I guess you will find out.

Good luck and congratulations on your new bundle of joy!!|`|VZTYanIOaa	Hey! Congratulations on the baby. =]    Alright, here are the biggest steps to losing weight:    Stop eating fast food, it disrupts weight loss completely. You don't need to cut it out completely, just look online at your favourite fast food restaurant's websites at the nutrition information. Nearly all of them have it.   Salads are a good fast food choice, but with grilled chicken on top (if its chicken) and always look at the dressing packets. Ask for light or fat-free dressings with salads. Most of those little packets are 150 calories or less.    Next, cut out badbadbad carbs such as crackers, white bread, pasta, etc. Go for whole wheat/whole grain bread.     Cheese is another thing that disrupts diets. Unless you eat a very small amount or maybe part-skim if you can get it. Peanut butter is another thing you need to eat in smaller amounts. Maybe a tablespoon at a time? Spread on a stick of celery or for a sandwich on wholegrain bread.    SODA. SODA. Badbad! It's amazing how many calories you can down from one soda can. Maybe diet soda? Coke zero tastes nearly exactly like regular soda with about 2 calories a can. Just don't drink a lot, it's still bad.    Drink water! It keeps you dehydrated, and full. Most people are just thirsty when they think they're hungry, which is why they overeat. Eight 8oz glasses of water is what you should get in a day.    Measure things out. You can completely get 10x more calories in by simply eyeballing it.    Read packages. You don't need to cut out your favourite foods completely. For example, a Chips Ahoy cookie only has 80 calories. Sure, an slightly high amount of fat but it's a cookie. Eating two of those wouldn't kill you.    Watch your calorie amounts! Even if you are eating healthier you definitely need to watch that.    If you exercise to burn maybe 250 extra calories a day, you could eat around 1500 calories and lose around 2 pounds in a week.    Good luck!|`|jR5kvXgeaa	find calorie/fitness calculator on the net, enter your stats and it will tell you how many calories a day you need to maintain your weight. take 300-400calories off that number and that's how much you need to lose weight.  eat 5-6 small meals a day instead of 3 big ones.  5-8 servings of fruit and vegetables a day.  8 glasses of water a day.  4-6 times a week cardio work out for 30-50min plus light weight training.  no junk food, no sodas, no white flour (white bread, pasta, cookies, cakes etc)

You can ask at your pharmacy for an over the counter cream treatment. If that doesn't work, call your Dr. and s/he can call a prescription out for you. You can also take a pill for killing the yeast.   The best way to treat a yeast infection is to treat yourself and your partner--otherwise you may get re-infected the next time you have sex.  Good luck.
QZTsiXAZaa	To gain weight you have to eat more calories than you burn. When adding calories, try to stay away from adding too much fat. While you can get fat from eating carbohydrates or protein, your body likes to use carbohydrates as fuel more than fat. To gain muscle, in addition to eating more you have to stimulate your muscles enough through resistance training that while they recover, they'll get bigger and stronger. To get an efficient workout you might want to join a gym if you aren't already a member.

Although these are sometimes used for weight loss or meal replacers, they provide an adequate amount of calories to help gain weight.  Putting peanut butter and butter on foods will also help. Drink 2% milk, eat meats.

No one knows why a non-smoker will get lung cancer or why not all smokers get lung cancer. Every age, gender, race, culture and human being on the planet can get cancer whether they are healthy or unhealthy. We are all at risk just by the fact we are living beings. There are over 200 different types of cancer and even more subtypes . . the real question isn't what not causes cancer . . the real question is why we don't all have cancer already! No one really knows. There may be many different triggers that must come into play before someone develops cancer.     Still what causes one person to get cancer, and another under similar circumstances to be spared?|`|AA11799998	Hugs are safe so far...|`|SlKoJj91aa	death|`|n592TE9waa	i know. everything causes cancer these days.  they say i can't freeze a water bottle,don't talk on the cell phone,don't stand in front of the microwave. ughhh  they should just wrap us all up in bubble wrap.  =]

If you want to lose weight use a well balanced died and a good exercise program. You can trick your mind into believing your full but not your body. If you dont provide your body with enough energy it will go into autostore and will save every scrap of energy available. The best way is a well balanced diet with a exercise program that works every muscle group in different ways. Hit a treadmill every day and you will autosave energy no matter what. Work arms and back one day, chest and legs the next, and keep tricking yourself, Remember you have to feed your muscles and they will burn all the fat you need. Dont starve yourself, the reason you feel queasy is not enough carbs and calories goin in, your runnin yourself dry.|`|agwb50UOaa	No that isnt a good way.

05cf133ffcfc58e79b03b398e8b17a92aa	Grapes, carrots, jam all change pretty quickly in your body to sugar.  While you are young you can normally handle this much sugar but as you get older you may discover that you are gaining weight.     There are many vegetables out there that are not loaded with natural sugars.  Your green leafy vegetables are a good place to start.  Broccoli, cucumbers, spinach,  and lettuce are all good for you.  They are loaded in vitamins.    Since you are a veterinarian you need to get your protein from another source.  Tofu  is a very good choice.  It has no real taste on its own so you can mix it with about anything.  I have even mixed it in Chili.  It was YUMMY Too!    Skim milk is a better choice but have you ever tried SILK.  Soy milk will also give you some protein.|`|AA12046386	a very healthy lunch|`|WbbF7svZaa	Sounds like a good balanced lunch to me!|`|2Yv7PH88aa	thats VERY good!!! :) keep it up!! wow! good good good! :) hey can you answer my Question its : Am i kinda fat?? plz answer....:)|`|1Pjra6Rcaa	That's a fairly healthy lunch.  The handful of mixed nuts would be better switched to a handful of raw almonds or a 1/2 cup of pinto beans.  At your age the biggest challenge to being vegetarian is getting enough protein.

ZfkrREsVaa	Exercise, you will lose weight and you will also feel better about yourself.|`|BWtJLZm6aa	It all starts in your mind.  More specifically it starts with your own body image.  If you are not comfortable or happy about your body, then it is almost impossible to think & feel sexy.  You mention that you are 30 lbs overweight.  Make sure that you are not comparing yourself to what we see in movies, on TV or in magazines.  You have 2 choices:     1) accept yourself as you are, believe that you have a nice body and move beyond the weight "issue."  Make sure to focus on the parts of you that are pretty or sexy.    2) Work to lose weight.  You can get some encouragement when you lose a couple of pounds, but this can be challenging when you go a week without losing any weight.  If you decide to go this route, you have a ton of options.  You can simply watch what you eat and try to increase exercise by walking more or doing simple exercises or you can change your eating habits and exercise regularly.  If you go with the more involved workout, I suggest Body For Life by Bill Phillips.  The program is pretty simple, plus, you get one day a week to eat anything you want.    When you are comfortable with you, then you can start working to change your attitude.  There are many attractive and sexy "plus size" models.  A large part of what makes them sexy is being comfortable with who they are and having that sexy attitude.  This may take some time and you may have to "fake it until you make it."  But you will get there.    For more sexy tips, check out my book "How To Get Your Sexy Back: I Want To Be A Diva Mom!"  While the book focuses on mothers, most of the information included can be applied to all women.|`|QC4y8oFBaa	I usually get my hair cut and styled in the salon, which makes me feel quite sexy :)  Also, buy some new feminine clothes and wear high heels!

gxOvJGJ5aa	This is what I would do:  1) See my family M.D. and see what he/she recommends (including non-surgical procedures).   2) Try the non-surgical procedures first.  3) If there is no non-surgical procedures available ask family M.D. for a recommendation for at least 2 plastic surgeons.  4) Consult at least two plastic surgeons and see what they recommend.  5) Choose the best option.
nWmwaZ1Saa	Are you on birth control? If not, once you take it, you need to keep taking it until not needed (to avoid pregnancy), you don't just use it once and your period comes right back normal the next month, you have to keep taking the birth control until like I said, it's not needed. Birth control is not used to skip periods, it's mainly used/prescribed to avoid pregnancy. You can ask your doctor to prescribe it to you, but you have to have a really good reason, not just "I want to skip my period this month".

So its win win. |`|KTE63c0vaa	well i tried it its really comfortable and relaxing but then my mom caught me once and she told me not to do it in-case my brother came to my room.i still do it but i need to put one of those door stoppers in my door plus i need to alarm my mobile phone at 5 or 6 in the morning so i could but my clothes back on,its risky but also relaxing....er i don't really sleep full nude, i don't take my bra and panties off|`|1QLUBnDlaa	First, it's not weird at all.  Lots of people (including my wife and I) sleep nude all the time.  Second, who cares if you're parents see you naked?  It's not the end of the world if they do.  Plus remember that they probably saw you lots of times growing up.    If they catch you, they'll probably just ask why you're naked.  Tell them you like sleeping like that.  If they don't want you to, they'll tell you.  Or you can avoid the whole getting caught part but just asking your parents if you can sleep nude.  The worst they can say is no.  But I bet they've slept nude themselves too :-O|`|CI40g7jPaa	tell them not to come in! Sleeping nude is the way to go. when I first started sleeping naked I would have nightmares about my parents walking in or that I was in public with no clothes on. haha but that goes away and it's the best.|`|A1fVYfqJaa	sleeping nude is where its at. straight up tell ur parents not to come in ur room.|`|Slu5VaMraa	This is hilarious!|`|YSlAvar8aa	Just close the door and keep the covers over you.  If they do catch you, they will likely knock from then on.|`|Ei4SonLiaa	First thing is can't you lock your door? Second, always hang a robe or something to put on quick near the door. Should any emergency occurs like fire, you can get dressed and zap outside.    I'm a nudist, and always hang a robe near my bedroom door, another near the front door in case of someone's visiting.|`|E2s3bdI0aa	It's definitely not weird at all to sleep naked.  Lots of people do it.  It's a lot more relaxing and comfortable.  You should get a lock on your door.  If you couldn't do that, let your parents know that you are entitled to have some privacy.  You are 16 after all.|`|95XTBIAnaa	Try talking to them about. Then follow many of the other good answers here. Robe nearby, close the door.    NiF|`|n7uoE9wmaa	Its your business what you wear or dont wear in bed,  Naked is definitely best.  I have done since I was 11, even in dorm at boarding school.  Go for it  |`|QW3tkVt7aa	Lock your door?
BfYu5obZaa	I would look for another doctor for a couple of reasons.  1. They were rude to you. You are the customer and they are providing a service. Rudeness should not have to be tolerated.    2. You wanted someone with you to calm you down, which would have made the whole process easier for everyone and they denied you that. That, in my opinion, is a complete lack of compassion.    3. If they are this controlling now, I can't see them being cool with any part of your birth plan they don't agree with.    Find another doctor that will be more compassionate to you, your husband and your unborn child. |`|AA10715286	You have every right to have your husband by your side!  This is a time for you both!  If they don't respect that then I would find another Dr.  Even if this was your 5th child, you have the right to have the experience you desire!  If your Dr. didn't listen to your concerns about having your husband by your side he/she may not listen to your concerns when it comes to the birth of your baby.
AA10568066	For a 1/2 cup dry (with-out milk) 40grams - 150 calories.    Keep in mind there are a couple different ways to get "Oat Meal" and or the oats. The two most popular are rolled oats/instant oats; they are flattened so they have more surface area and cook the quickest. Steel Cut Oats are the grain being cut into pieces, this preserves more of the flavor but is longer to cook. I personally think the Steel Cut Oats are healthier for you because it preserves more of the fiber strands in the oat. (Means better "cleaning" action).    Bellow are links for nutritional info, cooking recipes and links for oat meal:
8TmK8Qklaa	Yep being a pro-trainer myself I actually get a sense of how the cops must feel when they are spotted unexpectedly on the freeway and everyone slows down to the speed limit.  They see the brake lights and I bet they just laugh feeling powerful and mighty.    When I walk around the gym I feel that same kind of power especially when I stand in a military drill sergeant stance legs apart and arms folded at my chest staring into the sea of sweaty people trying to improve their image.  It's pretty damn funny when you can just stand nearby talking to someone and catch a glimpse of a guy upping his free weights and stacking them on like he pressed that much.    I like being intimidating I'm not going to lie! haha|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	Totally agree.   Male are egotistical creatures by nature. They have to be the alpha in their subconscious.     It's pretty funny to me.|`|1ZZ2iemcaa	Lol that is very common... It used to happed to me all the time.

AA10568066	Check your son's stool for unusual signs. If he is having an unusual stools, especially smell; then he is still having a gluten problem.    "The most common reason for poor response to the diet is that small amounts of gluten are still being consumed. Hidden sources of gluten include additives such as modified food starch, preservatives, and stabilizers made with wheat. And because many corn and rice products are produced in factories that also manufacture wheat products, they can be contaminated with wheat gluten."    You will want to take him to immunology specialist. Since his disease at the root is his autoimmune system. His Celiac Disease can be a sign of a larger issue with his immune system. Anything from allergies to another autoimmune disease not prognosed.    I feel for your situation. Unfortunately our health system has been turned into an "ultra efficient" system where the doctors know they can only stay with each patent for a certain period of time (generally 10-15 minuets) before they start "losing" money due to limited insurance reimbursements. The sad part is that cases like your son wind up being the prime example of why our medical system is broken.    Try finding a specialist and then see if you can find one that will take the extra time and tests that are needed. I hope this is helpful.|`|aFK7yD4xaa	I agree with most of what has been said so far, but I'm thinking if there is maybe something else you can do, without having to traipse from clinic to doctor's surgery to university hospital, because it's not just a strain on you and your child, you may have difficulty finding the time in amongst all the other things you have to do to put food on the table.    It's possible, as has been suggested, that he is reacting to other foods besides gluten. The most common for celiacs is dairy products, but it could be anything, even rice (although rice intolerance is very rare).     I know this sounds a bit drastic, and it generally is advised that people only do it with medical advice, but you are in a situation where you can't find a reliable doctor (which sadly is all too common), so if you feel you can do it, it's worth trying an elimination diet. You start with a small list of foods your child can eat, and he eats that for a week. If the symptoms improve you know you're on the right track. If not, bear with it, as some intolerances cause damage that takes a while to be repaired. Give it a few weeks before deciding that it's a dead loss.    I found this site, which has clear instructions that seem easy to follow: http://www.ei-resource.org/articles/alle...    You need to keep a food/symptom diary in conjunction with the diet. In fact, i would keep this for a week on the usual diet first, then go on the elimination diet, so you have a comparison to look at later (this sounds ridiculous, but when bad stuff goes away, it always seems to fade in the memory).    If you failed to find an improvement at all, try dropping down to just 2 or 3 ingredients for a week: rice, organic chicken and chicken broth (home made), pears. These are the foods which are tolerated by most people. If this results in an improvement, you can start adding foods one by one. If not, then food intolerance is almost certainly not the problem.|`|Q89bWY0Saa	maybe one of these sites can help you get in contact with someone who's willing to listen and follow through:    http://www.celiac.com/categories/Celiac-...    http://www.celiac.org/    http://www.csaceliacs.org/    http://www.mdjunction.com/celiac-disease  |`|CoiDQiTraa	I have been in the situation with myself. Going to doctor to doctor and no one does anything to help. I think all you really can do is to keep going to different doctors until someone listens and cares. Explain everything to them. Have they done tests to rule out other conditions? I'm sorry to hear this, good luck. :)|`|sLn5BivGaa	First let me say how sorry I am for you.  I know you are in a terrible situation, and having the medical community let you down makes you feel even more helpless, and even more of a failure to your child.    Celiac disease, as you may already know, can mimic many diseases.  What you may not know is that it often occurs in combination with other diseases.   Unfortunately, really good doctors are getting fewer and farther between.  You may have to do a lot of online research to see if you can find what else he may have, and also to find an expert in celiac and other auto-immune disorders.    I know you feel like you've gone to plenty of doctors, but I say don't stop now.  Is there a university hospital near you?  Sometimes the doctors there can think "outside the box" in coming up with a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan.  I'd keep seeing doctors if I were you, and stress to them that you believe he has something in addition to celiac disease.    Here's a couple of sites just to get you started, and I'm sure you can find hundreds more.  Don't give up -- you are your child's champion and advocate.    Good luck, I truly hope this helps...    http://www.csaceliacs.org/GreatMimic.php  http://www.celiac.com/articles/277/1/Uni...  http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/c/celiac_d...|`|7oZi3MsAaa	I am so sorry!!  Your poor son!!    It looks like Tex has some incredible advice to offer, hopefully some of that helped.  Another great resource is EnteroLab.com.  I was diagnosed with severe gluten and casein intolerance through them and honestly, despite the entire process being via UPS, phone and e-mail, I have never found such a warm, friendly and caring doctor's office.  Perhaps they could test to see if a) he is still getting gluten in his diet b) he has any other intolerances c) he is suffering still from malabsorbtion.  I have also quoted Dr. Fine in an article that I wrote for Celiac.com as saying that even topical gluten should be avoided.  I started a website to even recommend natural, gluten free skin products.  If you son is young have you tried California Baby's products?  Their line is gluten free and they have great products for kids.    Though his condition does sound more severe than traces of gluten, so having a stool test done for other possible intolerances sounds like a great next step.  Good luck!!!  |`|ti98yfK1aa	I'm so sad to hear that your son and your family are going through this.  There is a wonderful group based in the US called Silly Yaks:      http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Sil...    They are a group of people who are dealing with all the challenges that life with Celiac Disease can bring.    The first thing I thought when I read your e-mail was, "Did the whole house go GF?"  Is there any way your son could be getting contaminated through his play?  (i.e. playdough has gluten in it)  Do you check labels EACH AND EVERY TIME you buy something at the store?  I know that BBQ potato chips USED to be GF but now they're not.    I might suggest that you turn your whole house into a GF zone.  Make sure that any other children you may have wash their hands carefully when they get home from school in order to keep from cross contaminating your house.  Stress to them that they cannot bring non-GF things home.  Make sure that your son never shares pencils/pens with anyone who might come in contact with gluten.  Re-educate your other family members (from what I hear, Grandmas can be a challenge) on the danger of gluten with your son's diagnosis.    I might also suggest that you consult a dietitian who specializes in working with people who are on a gluten free diet/have celiac disease.  Not every dietitian has experience with this, so do your homework before you make the appointment.    Lastly, for the next month, try to make meals that are ALREADY gluten free instead of the gluten free alternative of something dangerous. (i.e. baked potato, home baked chicken dinner...make sure you thicken any gravy with corn starch and not wheat flour, homemade roast beef dinner, oven baked fried chicken using Nature's Path GF corn flakes, an omelette...if you want more suggestions, please feel free to e-mail me)  I know it is more work and it is more costly, but it is worth it just to see if something is sneaking in.      I really wish you the best of luck.  
QjEFSO8Vaa	Seems like a lot of people are lifting weights nowadays.  I did this when I was younger but decided running and riding my bike was more therapeutic than pumping out reps with the barbell.  I have toned abs and although I dont have a lot of muscles I definitely have some definition.  The easiest way to get toned is through regular cardiovascular exercise in my opinion.  Big muscles are useless when you dont have a strong heart to pump blood into your muscles.|`|AA11132502	There are several ways to change up a weight routine.      You can change from doing a full body workout every other day to a upper body workout one day and a lower body workout the next day (abs everyday).  You can change from hand weights for a few weeks to weight machines at a gym for the next few weeks.  You can choose, let's say, ten upper body and ten lower body exercises and then do only five upper body and five lower body exercises on week 1, and the next five on week 2.  It's even okay to just change the way you do the reps--one week low weights and slow lifts to another week of higher weights and faster lifts.  If you do full body workouts, change the routine---like start with lower body and then upper body and then vice-versa.  If you do cardio first, do it last instead.      I've heard it's best to change up the routine about every three weeks or so.    The best bet is to go to the library and check out a book on weight training.  (Unless you have a few dollars and can afford a good weight training book at a bookstore.)  
ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.   an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|AA11132502	Other than surgical, there is no way to lose just abdominal fat.  You must lose fat in general to lose that abd.  Cardio is best for fat loss.  Weight training increases muscle which increases metabolism which in turn reduces body fat assuming that you are eating healthy and well while limiting sugars.  Sugars (including carbs) increase insulin in your blood stream.  This in turn MAY increase the body's ability to store fat.      So, in short---get active with cardio and weight training--and eat healthy!|`|EXdM30fYaa	I would suggest a cleansing diet. I lost 12 pounds in 9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. I also lost a lot of inches too!   I learned that cleansing will help the body get rid of toxins.  Toxins come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives and lots of other things.  The toxins get stored in the fat in our body.  To get rid of the fat, we have to get rid of the toxins by cleansing the body.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow. I did Jenny Craig, Weight Watcher and Medifast.  If you want to learn more call the toll free number 1-877-587-4647 or check out the website.  This was the first time I ever did a cleanse, it was easy and I feel better.

I started counting calories and measuring my maintenance level. I then adhered to the 15% rule - I ate 15% less than maintenance and cut back on complex carbs. The diet I used is the one reviewed here - http://www.squidoo.com/best-strip-that-f...    Then look at your exercise. One of the biggest mistakes I was making was actually working out too much!

AA10429010	There is absolutely nothing wrong with you!!!    This is coming from someone who has suffered from this emotion her entire life.  I started suffering from this feeling during my preteens and still struggle to this day (I'm 26). I literally went through the exact same thing, I literally had people accuse me of being anorexic when I just wasn't ever hungry.  Chances are you are suffering from depression, but only a good therapist or doctor can diagnose this for sure.  I recommend researching depression and talking with your parents that you really think this is problem that is beyond just a teenage funk.    While I am not a doctor, I am not always the biggest fan of using medications to solve this problem, but only you, your parents, and your physician can determine what is best for you.  Here are some small things that may help you:  ~ Keep a diary or a journal of your feelings (it may seem childish, but it's good to get them out in the air)   ~ Look into sunlamps (they help with increased depressive feelings that occur as daylight decreases in the fall and winter)  ~ Talk with trusted family and friends (they are there to help you, even if doesn't feel like it)  ~ Remind yourself everyday that you are a great person who is headed for great things (even if you can't see it at the moment)  ~ Surround yourself with positive people that will not bring you down or encourage you to do something you may later regret  ~ Forgive yourself for things that you have done and are not proud of  ~ Remember that you are never ever alone    Lastly, I know that I am complete stranger, but please if there is anything I can do to help, send me an email (even if it is just to vent)|`|LR5m5WDOaa	Sounds like depression.  I would tell you parents that you feel like this "teenage phase" is a little more than you can handle and ask to see a therapist or talk to you physician about it. |`|f0GIqjSLaa	to me it sounds like you are suffering from a little bit of depression i would seek medical help if it were me|`|RvuKTT0Jaa	I agree with both your family and mentor that knowingly or unknowingly, you are under some form of stress and coupled with your 'teenage phases', you are having a 'hormone storm' - a critical but physiologic reason for the irrationality of adolescent behavior.    All too often hormone imbalance during teen years is misinterpreted, incorrectly treated, or just plain ignored. All it takes is a sudden change in the balance of the levels of estrogen and progesterone, "and poof!" you have emotional problems. The overwhelming rise in progesterone in the second half of the month, after ovulation, may bring about depression in your otherwise pleasant teen.    If it is indeed due to hormone imbalance that causes your behavorial changes, learning to cope with stress and eliminating the spikes of cortisol levels are the first steps. Supplementation with natural hormones is the second step. Natural hormones are so similar to your own hormones and their action so gentle, they can easily right the balance and eliminate the symptoms. Finally, recreating the ideal hormone balance helps naturally eliminate the symptoms and boosts your spirits while your own hormone manufacturing system rights itself.

jNPCT96Xaa	I am in a very similar boat, however I am not an eligible candidate for IVF. I would keep doing the metformin. Get your diabetes under control. Loose the weight and keep it off. I kind of agree with your doctor not doing the IVF, if you are overweight and already have these issues, the chances of a healthy, full term pregnancy are very slim. And with the amount of money it costs, your doctor wants to help you make sure it works. It gets hard at times, I'll completly agree with you on that. And I get depressed about it on occasion, but you need to look at the brighter side. You are preparing your body for a heathy baby. You want to provide a loving, safe, and healthy home for your baby once its born, right? Then you need to be able to provide the same environment while its inside you. I am not going to say you'll have a baby by a certain date or time in your life, but you should want to be as healthy as possible if the chance and opportunity arises.    Congratulation on loosing 98 pounds. That is a major accomplishment and you should be so proud of it. It gets hard, but make sure you have someone you can talk to. Depending on your area, there might be a fertility support group you can attend. I go to one and it has helped me in ways I couldn't imagine.    Good luck sweetie.

Typically, the ovaries contain multiple cysts. Diagnosis is by pregnancy testing, hormone level measurement, and imaging to exclude a virilizing tumor. Treatment is symptomatic.

Beside the fact that it is just empty calories and excess sugar and there is NO nutritional value,  the acid in it will leach the calcium out of your body.  Most kids don't get enough calcium as it is.  What they have never had they won't miss and if you are raised without something then you tend not to want it or like it when you are older.

DzHB8z6Yaa	Here are some guidelines in using rubber bands with your braces for the purpose of straightening your teeth: Rubber bands are used to keep the teeth moving and thereby keep them healthy and get them back to their usual normal shape.    The midpoints of the teeth are important in the set of teeth making it to the perfect jaw line. These midpoints fall into the perfect jaw line with the use of rubber bands. These could be worn for optimum use and they do not stand alone often enough as the primary treatment. Discretion should be maintained in wearing these and it is better to consult the orthodontist.    Wearing the rubber bands is an art in itself. You just can't design it the way you want. Rubber bands behave like rubber bands; therefore, don't stretch them too much and they will pop inside your mouth. There is a hook thing that accompanies it and that is good to manoeuvre rather than old raw style of stretching it to the optimum. Caution should be exercised when you try to fit them in. of course, you can use your fingers for the same and that is quite normal. You have to wear it according to your orthodontist's advice. Naturally, it is tempting to pull in every tooth that is crooked and sticking out into its centre, but that is not the right way to go about it. All in all, braces rubber bands are effective enough. Though they might feel strange at first, you'll get used to|`|vkI84yPCaa	well.. mine were for pulling my top teeth to the bottom ones so when i smile my teeth can touch in the front.. they are always used for moving your bottom/top part forward or backwards, for a better bite..|`|r5oL56xCaa	it helps put your teeth in alignment     pulling your teeth forward or backwards...for when you have like an overbite|`|TgIMUmZPaa	it helps with fixing alignment and the bite.
BaxwbIk8aa	It's completely normal to feel it when your blood sugar spikes. I'm pretty sure that dry mouth isn't a sign of diabetes, but being unreasonably thirsty is. Just to be safe you can check out the signs of diabetes at this website: http://diabetes.about.com/od/symptomsdia... Or you could just get a check up with your doctor. Ask for a urine test, and they can tell you pretty much definitively.    Hope this helps! :)
KeeaVzxpaa	I5 minutes is not long enough to wait before testing. You should wait at least a half hour to an hour. Sugar will give a fast elevation and just a fast lowering. You want to eat foods that are digested slowly to avoid surges in blood sugar. Proteins, complex carbs, and no sweets. It is a condition that may be a result of diet more than defect. It will resolve itself in time as the pancreas get tired of putting out so much insulin or the body becomes resistant.|`|k0EIC2kaaa	Hypoglycemia can be caused by a lot of things. A double cheeseburger and fries would have a high sugar content (assuming you got it from a fast-food outlet).     I'd suggest seeing a doctor since hypoglycemia has hundreds of causes. There's a lot of crap on the internet about hypoglycemia that is only pseudo-scientific, so be sure to exercise a degree of scepticism when reading it.|`|AA10876072	When you are hypoglycemic you will experience lows and feel dizzy at times and you'll get the shakes.    You will need to eat small meals throughout the day.  Always have some nuts or fruit on hand.  The protein bars are good too.     Just eating more frequently will help.    Definitely see your doctor though.  Doc knows best.    Good Health to you.|`|w4kdTalPaa	You should wait an hour before you test after eating.
9l0GdKbbaa	Make sure it is a yeast infection and not Bacterial Vaginosis or it will get much worse!! But yes, what you heard was true.    Buy a small carton of "plain" yogurt -- doesn't matter whether it is name brand or store brand or is nonfat, low fat or whole fat because you are NOT going to eat it. But make sure it is PLAIN with NO fruit, NO added sugar (milk sugar listed on the carton doesn't count of course), and NO flavoring in it of ANY type. You should make sure that whatever type yogurt you buy has "ACTIVE CULTURES" listed on its container.      Take a tampon and dip it into the yogurt and insert it into the vagina, allowing it to stay in place for at least an hour or so -- longer certainly won't hurt you. It is COOL and SOOTHING for one thing and will get some of the "good bacteria" right where it is needed the most since that is the main reason to use it -- to get the "GOOD" bacteria into where there is a build up of too much "bad" yeast type bacteria.      Continue this for once or twice a day for two or three days, or as long as needed, until the situation resolves itself.      REMEMBER TO KEEP THE CONTAINER OF "MEDICINAL" YOGURT SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER ONES IN YOUR FRIG THAT YOU MIGHT EAT (and of course throw out any leftovers) LOL
298865cd9302e6c3b9f7e1e85844a845aa	It sounds like you're having withdrawal. Does the crying go away after you take a dose? Your situation sounds exactly like mine. I took Ativan for two weeks, but just one tablet (1/2 milligram) right before bed. I would sleep great, but the next day I'd gradually start to feel funny... like in a daze. Then I'd start crying for no reason, and I would actually have the feeling like I was going crazy. But still I hadn't put it together that it was because of the Ativan. I stopped taking it for two days, and I went through an utter hell. The first night, I didn't sleep for more than a total of about five minutes. Then the next morning I was a crying, anxious wreck. It took a visit to the doc to finally figure out that I was having w/d symptoms.     Ativan only lasts in your system for a few hours. So it's normal to feel good for a while after taking it, but if you're addicted then about four or five hours after taking it you'll start having w/d symptoms. If you don't take another dose at that point, you'll continue to have even worse symptoms.     To get over this, you need to keep a level amount of Ativan in your body at all times. So in my situation, I started taking 1/2 mg in the AM, 1/3 mg in the afternoon, and then 1/2 mg in the evening. Then, over the course of literally more than a year, I gradually tapered off each of these doses. You can't get off it quickly, and the slower you go the less distress you'll have.     Check out this manual: http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/index.htm - It's what people who know what they're doing rely on in creating a tapering plan. A doc who tells you to go cold turkey, or who makes you taper off over a week or two, does not know what he/she is doing.     One w/d symptom is what they call "rebound anxiety." It's part of the thing that causes people to get addicted. You take the drug and you feel better, but then you start to have w/d symptoms - including bad anxiety - and you actually think you're just having an anxiety attack, when in fact you're having w/d symptoms - so you take more Ativan, which just reinforces the addiction... You're probably not having "real" anxiety - you're probably having rebound anxiety as a result of being off the meds.
oO4TUkVkaa	Yeah that's definitely a spider bite.  you should be fine as long as you have not started experiencing any side effects like blurred vision or feeling funny.
mZprL9TJaa	Just because she has had a negative ultrasound and negative HIDA scan doesn't mean it's not her gallbladder. There is one other test they can do to check the gallbladder and that is and EGD with bile collection. EGD is short for Esophagogastroduodenoscopy. It is a procedure where she will be sedated and they will use a scope with a camera and light on it to look into her stomach and duodenum which is the start of the small intestines.When they are far enough down they will give something called CCK through an IV.CCK is something your body makes naturally to cause your gallbladder to contract. When they give the CCK and the gallbladder contracts they will collect a Bile sample as it comes from the gallbladder.They can test the bile for cholesterol crystals and if it is positive she has a bad gallbladder. Cholesterol crystals are found in the gallbladder when it is not functioning properly.She will be sedated for this procedure by a surgeon of GI specialist. Also gallbladder symptoms can be very similar to those of Acid Reflux disease or even stomach ulcers. The good thing about the EGD with bile collection is they will already been in there and they can examine her esophagus and stomach to see if she in inflammed which is a sign of reflux. Does she have any heartburn at all? Tried any other-the-counter meds like Prilosec or Zantac?  When my gallbladder was bad I had a negative ultraound but positive HIDA scan. I work for a surgeon though and we have quite a few patients that have both negative tests and he has to do an EGD with bile collection and it turns out they have a bad gallbladder. She needs to find a doctor that will perform endoscopies and request to hava an EGD with Bile Collection. Hope this helps|`|FDj6rzl9aa	It sounds like pancreatitis to me...that would not show up on an ultrasound.|`|Z0SiMz7daa	Her symptoms sound like gall bladder disease.  One can have Cholecystitis (gall bladder disease) and still have a normal ultrasound and a normal HIDA Scan.  There can be gallstones that are too small to be seen on an ultrasound and the HIDA scan can still be normal.  She should see a gastroenterologist for further testing/diagnosis.  In the mean time she should avoid all spicy and fatty foods and anything that makes the pain worse.|`|AA11091233	I'm so sorry your mom is going through this.    I don't understand that part about 75 and 40%...      I had a gallbladder attack and the pain was so excruciating I was in emerg all night and they had to give me Demerol as often as possible. It was 7 years ago but I will never forget that type of pain. It just got worse and worse and worse till I was screaming. Especially in my back, like your mom. My gallbladder was so infected, they were not able to operate until 2 weeks of massive antibiotics first.     Surely with that scan...they would know what they are doing and if they felt it necessary, to treat her.    If she is in that much pain, I'd go back to doctor or hospital. They have to give her an answer!  How can they just let her go without an answer? If could be a hernia, appendix..God..if she is still in constant pain...she should go to emergency as soon as possible in my opinion. This doesn't sound like a case of 'something'...but she must be told what is wrong for God''s sake.    Hope she feels better soon......sorry I don't have an actual answer..I don't think anyone will until she is tested further.    Take care.|`|cx5Z5XEtaa	have gallbladder removed they have a sluggish  gallbladder SLUDGE you dont' have stone but you can have sludge and or like me i was normal and full of hyperplastic polyps? and i have severe gastritis no h pyloirc bacteria hiatle hernia sooo  i'm on zantac 150 OTC 2 x day doing ok and i am on a gluten freee menu no grease no fats, try drinking lemon water and eating activa yogurt, have a chiropractor make an adjustment you could have a subluxation casue an irritiation for the pain ,|`|9c602a89600531b7e92ac1d7eaccc1ffaa	Have you tried the pickle trick?

A characteristic red skin rash across the nose and cheeks. Rashes may also occur on the face and ears, upper arms, shoulders, chest, and hands. Because many people with lupus are sensitive to sunlight (called photosensitivity), skin rashes often first develop or worsen after sun exposure.    NSAIDs, antimalarials, immunosuppressives and DMARDs can help. (:|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	I have a friend with Lupus.  She and I found out about MSM, a supplement, about the same time.  She had had lupus for over ten years when we found the supplement. She said it helped her more than anything she had tried.  I think the book we read was called "The Miracle of MSM".    Lupus can do lots of varied things to your body.  It is an auto-immune disease, which means that for unknown reasons your immune system attacks healthy parts of your body.  I hope you don't have it.  If you believe you have such a problem go to a doctor so you know.  I think that you can get a test for your "sed rate", a blood test that shows how long it takes your blood to settle in a test tube.  If not that made the CPR test for inflammation, which is something that the immune attack causes.  If you find out you have it, contact me for some ideas.  One of them for anyone is to take fish oil.  Start with one a day, then one twice a day, prior to eating.  After a week raise it more. Fish oil is a supplement your body needs that is also an anti-inflammatory.  Turmeric would work well, too.  There are lots of other diet things and other stuff.      I hope you do not have lupus.

YUXvCttVaa	Dont believe the hype. http://www.buybulkwhey.com|`|9vFHobQ5aa	Well, Dave, you probably don't want to hear what I'm about to say, and the chances are pretty good that you won't believe me, but buying protein is a waste of money. Oh the health food stores and the jocks in the gym wil swear it works, but it's all hype and misconception. Your body cannot utilize more than 15 to 18 % protein. any extra protein that you eat must be converted into glycogen or fat depending upon your degree of activity. And converting protein into glycogen or fat produces more toxins that must be processed by your liver and eliminated by your kidneys, thus putting added and unnecessary strain on both organs. The truth is, in this country most people eat more protein than they should without taking supplements. So how did this fad start? Simple: protein is necessary for building muscle, so the reasoning goes the more protein you eat, the more muscle you get. That's like saying water is necessary for the assimilation of nutrients, so the more water you drink, the more nutrients you'll assimilate. I taught chemistry at the University of New Mexico, and I've been doing progressive weight training and aerobic exercise all of my life. When I retired, I decided to take the necessary courses and examination to become a certified personal trainer. The reason is I've seen so many people (including trainers) perform exercises wrong and / or give poor advice that I decided to become certified so I would have the necessary credentials to correct people in the gym who were doing things wrong. I usually don't bother with the jocks because they wouldn't listen to me anyway, but I have helped a few people and it's a good feeling.It really upsets me that these businesses take advantage of peoples gulibility and ignorance to sell worthless....well, not worthless, but totally unnecessary and useless products, and charge ten times what they're worth. But as I said, you probably won't believe me. You could do the necessary research on nutrition to corroborate what I'm telling you, but that's up to you. I wish I could go through your program with you; if you're like most people, your training methods predicated upon increasing muscle mass are probably wrong. Gosh, Dave, this sounds so negative. I'm sorry. I really am, but the truth is there are so many misconceptions that are thought to be true and accepted as  gospel that it's truly amazing. If you were to buy a book on personal training and just read the chapters on musccle growth, you'd gain more insight than listening to all the guys in the gym. In any case, good luck, Dave. I wish yo all the best!

PfE6bg5iaa	previous answer is correct, these methods are very ineffective.     I can't take birth control with estrogen due to a history of blood clots... is this the same for you? There are progestin only options if so.. such as depo shot, the mini pill, Mirena, or Implanon.     If you can't take ANY hormonal birth control, there's also the copper IUD Paraguard. It is the most cost effective form of birth control and can last 10 years.     Good luck!|`|AHpS6qPDaa	The rhythm method is by far one of the most ineffective "birth control" methods ever. Old school Catholic families(the super large families) are essentially built off of the rhythm method.    Are all types of doctor prescribed birth control out of the question? There are several methods like the pill, the shot, the patch, the ring as well as the copper IUD.      You can try a diaphram but those are best used with a condom or another form of birth control.   There's the female condom, contraceptive sponge, cervical cap, and spermicide.       http://www.americanpregnancy.org/prevent...    Talk to your doctor.

If you are at a friend's house or with family you can't watch them so you won't be tempted like you would at home.  Also, go out with friends.  Also, I am sure you can find other things to talk about.  What about work?  What about funny things you have heard or seen?  If you have trouble talking to girls take them to a movie so you don't have to talk and then after the movie you can talk about the movie which will then lead to other conversations like similar movies, movies you have hated or liked in the past (and no, not those one!!!) and you could then move on to music etc|`|s0HTHGd4aa	Honestly, there is no easy way to beat an addiction.

You can google "sex addiction therapist" in your area and that should provide you with some information on how to get the process started.

I fell to my knees when it hit me. It left a bruise for almost a year. I guess I must have bruised all the way down to the bone.    The other one lasted about 6 months, it was on my thigh. I was swimming in the pool and my pit-bull jumped in with me and scratched my thigh. I didn't bleed but left a large long lasting bruise.    Both were light green for a long time.

Lh4S3q53aa	I can tell ya what my bodies heaviest organ is...  Giggity!|`|l0oDymHYaa	The Brain|`|EVS0OyiPaa	The largest and heaviest internal organ is the liver with an average of 1.6 kilograms (3.5 pounds).      Incidentally, the skin is the bodys heaviest organ, with a mass of 4-5 kg, (8.8 - 11lbs) and a total surface area of about 1.2-2.2 square meters.     The skin is composed of two layers, the epidermis and the dermis.   The epidermis is the outermost layer, which principally functions as a protective barrier, while the dermis is the vascularised, innermost layer.     Beneath the skin, there is a layer of loose connective tissue known as the hypodermis, or superficial fascia.     This layer is not part of the skin itself, but instead it functions to loosely attach the skin to the subadjacent tissue.     As a fatty layer, the hypodermis also functions as a shock absorber and as an insulator.|`|1c0af89a7a3994b723a2e1937655cae0aa	Liver

It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.    The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.    And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!

Did your doctor put you on antiviral medications and steroids?  I am not a doctor, but these both helped me.  Talk to your doctor about them and see what he says.  Both will help speed healing along.    Personally, I used vitamin B-12 therapy along with these.  There is some research that suggests this will help with healing because it has an impact on healing nerves.     I have written a few articles on Bells Palsy.  One offers some basic suggestions on dealing with the side effects and the other discusses the B-12 I mentioned.  Ill add both links for you.      Try not to panic.

I have made friends and was scared to stop.  My friends told me that they were going to tell the POPO if I didnt stop.  My parents even cried when I told them.  Now I am going to cry for you, you are absolutely better than that.  Keep your chin up and go for the gold.      KTF my dear friend|`|680cb5a7fc4a145b826513b347634394aa	You basically dont need a reason not to cut, its in your dna to self mutilate, so I'm surprised that you've waited five days to cut again, Since you've only been cutting for 7 months, its understandable that you think you need a reason, that feeling will pass, just give it time. You still have a lifetime of cutting left in you.
FTRs5w3eaa	Yes, you can take the Nyquil. It suggests not taking any other acetaminophen with the Nyquil or Dayquil because of the risk of liver damage.    If you were to take around 3,000mg of Tylenol, (acetaminophen) for a few YEARS straight, you are at risk of shutting your liver down.   So, most doctors and pharmacists, (and the FDA) do not want you to take more than 2,000mg of acetaminophen a day to essentially eliminate that risk.|`|yE2vM76naa	They both contain acetaminophen so they include the warning not to take it with (additional) acetaminophen to prevent you from taking too much of that particular drug.|`|FOCOywTfaa	When I am sick I take dayquil all day and nyquil every time I wake up at night.    I literally live on that stuff when I'm sick.
R1LvhhTeaa	Hummm - the first thing that hits me is muscle cramp.  This can arise out of something wrong at the back - perhaps where a rib attaches at the spine.  If you have a chiropractor to talk to, they can straighten this out in about 1 minute.      Also for muscle cramp you can make sure you get a little extra magnesium for a while - maybe a little extra salt - and take three aspirin every 4 hours for a bit.
EFYxcWNyaa	since it is 2 appointments for cleaning I think you are going to have a "deep cleaning" which requires injections so you wouldn't feel pain. in that case you might feel sore for a couple of days which I think it would be a good idea to postpone the cleaning after vacation. call you dentist to reschedule your appointment and explain your reasoning, I think they will agree.
07YBD5mJaa	you broke a blood vessel.  The most likely source of the bleeding is a small tear in the lining of the urethra.  This usually heals on its own.  However, I would defer sexual activity for 7-10 days to avoid further injury until it is healed.    There are 2 other less likely possibilities.  Penile fractures are very obvious.  They generally occur when while having vigorous intercourse, on thrusting inward, the penis misses the opening and forcefully strikes your partner's pelvis.  This is accompanied by a cracking sound, similar to snapping a twig.  The penis immediately becomes limp, swollen and bruised.  The fracture is actually a tear in the membrane around the corpora cavernosa (erectile body).  Minor tears may heal without treatment but larger ones are best repaired surgically.  If left alone, the scarring that occurs during the healing process, may cause some curvature of the penis with erection.  Penile fractures are quite dramatic and unless you experienced the above, I doubt you suffered a fracture.      The last  type of bleeding usually comes from the prostate gland. It is due to a tear in one of the fragile veins of the prostate.  The prostate is the organ that produces the majority of the seminal fluid in response to sexual stimulation. When the prostate contracts at the time of ejaculation, a vein may tear and blood mixes with the semen (hematospermia).  Red blood indicates new and dark (brownish) discoloration indicates previous bleeding.    In addition, prostatic bleeding frequently is associated with gross blood during urination.  This typically will occur with initiation or at the end of urination (as opposed to being throughout the entire stream). With the latter, it is often manifest as spots of blood on the underwear, pajamas or bed sheets..  Irritation of the gland (prostatitis) can also cause it to become inflamed and predisposed to bleed.  Some factors leading to inflammation include too frequent or too infrequent ejaculation, sexual arousal without ejaculation, withdraw at the time of ejaculation, excessive alcohol or spicy foods, prolonged sitting or bike riding, etc. The prostate may then become secondarily infected and require antibiotic therapy for cure. Sometimes as the prostate gradually enlarges with age, friable veins called varices develop on its surface.   These are also prone to tearing.  In such cases, Proscar or Avodart is sometimes prescribed to shrink both the prostate and the veins.   Although hematospermia is not a typical sign of prostate cancer, its presence may indicate an increased risk of prostate cancer.  Therefore, it is advisable to seek consultation with a urologist to evaluate this condition.     Again, I suspect you just had a minor urethral tear.  If symptoms persist, you need to see a urologist. Good luck.|`|UsojaTuuaa	you need to go see a doctor|`|jK9yiQq6aa	you need to see a urologist|`|dtq32xuwaa	thats what 38 years of mauster bait do to you.|`|5eb82f15d183d6d66fa6225d22e2faabaa	two likely reasons:    1. you have an infection, like prostatitis, that can be caused by an STD, or even a non sexually transmitted bacteria    2. cancer. testicular or prostate.

6goQ3VVJaa	it is not uncommon in some cases to have your period a week or so late. If you have started taking any new medications (especially birth control pills) check the label for side effects. If you are currently going through puberty this is a very common thing to happen and if you're a virgin you aren't pregnant so I wouldn't worry about it. If worse comes to worse, ask your mom she will know how to answer this better than anyone|`|UlBOzZpyaa	lol.  it may be because you had stress, or changes in diet/ other stuff    i skipped 2 MONTHS straight cuz i had so much stress from school and drama ):    but dont be worried.

ZbMLigR3aa	Only in rare cases is it possible (such as with a septate hymen) for it to still be intact after penetration.  However, I highly doubt it because you would not be able to have full on sexual intercourse if that were the case.  If you are bleeding and having pain at this point you need to take this issue up with your gynecologist.   You may have some sort of infection going on that requires medical attention.  I hope you get this sorted out quickly and painlessly.  Good luck!|`|izFTUHouaa	I agree with the other answer. Whenever your in doubt about things going on with your vagina go to the gyno.

WgzPhQeTaa	Hey,    No fast food, ie burgers, chips, fried stuff, pies, pastries  Potato Crisps, chocolate, sugery cereals, cakes, biscuits.    I know these are the best things! You can probably treat yourself to one if youve been good every week.   The best way to loose weight is make your portions smaller, instead of having two sandwiches for lunch have one and a piece of fruit for example. Have a good breakfast with a healthy cereal and piece of toast and it will keep you going untill lunch and dont snack on chips ect, if your hungry have a fruit, even sultanas make a good snack as they are sweet but not fatty.    Good luck and stay healthy|`|uqRb9tAqaa	Don't lose too much weight, you're already pretty lean.   But here's a biggie quick list    Fried foods & Deep fried foods (French fries, Tempura, etc.)  Anything with breading on it (Chicken strips, etc.)  Don't eat any drive through, at all.   Anything with high fructose corn syrup (It turns into fat right away without even being digested, it's impossible to burn off, and it contains traces of mercury, which is toxic)   Patatoes - they contain tons of carbs  Soda (Trade it in for water)  Ice cream  Candy  Pie  Cake    Things you can eat in moderation - but not too much  Butter  Bread  Diet Soda  Things with lots of carbs  Avacado (High in fat)|`|azpLvnahaa	I know you think that at 13 years old you shouldn't weigh 132 pounds, but here's the deal...At 5'6", 132 is not a bad weight AT ALL. It all depends on how you carry (which none of us can say without a picture...which I highly suggest NOT posting). You need to talk to your doctor and see what THEY think about you losing weight. At 13 years old, you may still have some of that "baby fat" hanging on. For many, it goes away by the time you reach 18.    Don't eat fast food, or drastically cut back on it. Eat high fiber foods and whole grains. Cut out white food...white rice, white flour/bread, regular old peach-ish pasta. If you eat meat, make sure it's lean meat. Get the majority of your fruits from fresh fruit, not juices. Same with vegetables.    Limit your portion sizes. Eat slowly. Don't over-eat.    As far as a SPECIFIC diet, it's best you discuss it with your Doctor, who can refer you to a nutritionist. At your age, dieting to lose weight you don't NEED to lose can start you on a BAD road in the future.|`|PWIjeHmQaa	stuff that makes you fat.|`|aFzqYyLSaa	132 lbs sounds like a reasonable weight, but you should develop healthy habits when you are young.  The biggest no nos are  pecan pies  milkshakes or shakes of any kind  muffins  staying away from fast food is a no brainer,  and soda's really add on the calories fast. But diet soda's have some sort of bad chemical in them which I forgot, so try to drink soda on a rarity.|`|Br3hJfDCaa	Avoiding certain foods altogether is not such a good idea. To sustain weightloss, one needs to have long-term food plan, not just a "diet".  By not allowing yourself "treats' on an  occassional basis, there's a high chance that you'll have "bad" eating days & even give up on being healthy altogether.  Eating a slice of chocolate cake shouldn't be seen as "naughty" but an experience to be enjoyed!!    And BTW, you do not seem fat at all too me, and having some curves is a good thing!!  It's up to your body to decide what it's ideal weight it should be, all you can do is to try to be healthy.  Enjoy being 13 & young, and focus on school & your friends instead.|`|NjVVuMrtaa	No fast food

1lewFV8oaa	20/30 vision is really close to normal vision.  20/30 vision means that you have to be 20ft from an object to see it clearly when a person with normal vision can see the object at 30 ft.    You will pass the DMV vision exam with 20/30 vision in most states.    Eyeglasses may help a little with distance, but I would not say it was a need at this point.

If you don't go to sleep, get up and do something relaxing. And when you wake up in the morning, get up straight away. Eventually you'll get so tired that your body will just sleep whenever you lie down.    Of course, I can't actually force myself to follow this advice because it's so hard to start with. :P    Try going for a walk a few hours before you want to go to bed. Then just do relaxing things in the evening to unwind. Don't drink anything with caffeine in it before bed, obviously. Being on the computer can make it harder to sleep afterwards as well, apparently.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	I had all these great ideas for you - I have problems getting to sleep, also, but it looks like sparkinx covered everything I would say.

046668252b7d273d3a4a3a6908a8607daa	I work in a kid's hospital and have seen quite a few wee ones over the winter with wheeze and pneumonia. It's a shame but some kids are just susceptible to respiratory illnesses while others just have the bad luck of having a bad cold go down into their chest.    Almost all kids bounce back, especially once they're on oxygen and antibiotics which make them feel better. Hopefully, you will see improvement over the next couple of days. It can be scary to see at first but just remember that all the monitoring and tubes are there to help her.    I hope the wee one gets well soon.

36C2dn6eaa	Your eyes are strained because they have to focus on the same place all day long.  Every hour to two hours, you should give your eyes a five-minute break from concentrating on something the same distance away for so long.  You should get up and walk around a bit (btw if you're actually sitting still for that long, you're putting yourself at risk for blood clots to form in your legs, and those can kill you suddenly without warning -- look up pulmonary embolisms).  You should get up and take a few minutes' walk around and look at things that are at a distance from you, such as out the windows on your way to the bathroom, or if you can, you might actually go outside and walk around the block.  This will help all your muscles loosen up.

nfIQhpFvaa	Contact the health department for the county in which you live and let them know you want a free diabetes screening. Most of not all counties within the US offer this as diabetes has become epidemic and good control now means better health later.      Your health department, if they do not offer it, they should be able to direct you appropriately, if that fails, the county hospitals are very equipped to deal with uninsured or underinsured patients that need medical care, this includes the HbA1c lab test to screen for diabetes.  If it is later determined that you have diabetes, they will be able to help you begin treating your diabetes.    Good luck to you and keep the thread posted as you go along.

If you can't walk a mile, start by walking as far as you can.     Then try and speed walk. I know its hard for you, so pick a few houses on your street and try and speed walk between as many as you can, then go back to slow walking.  Gradually increase the amount of houses you go before you go back to the slow pace. Eventually make it the whole mile    Then start jogging between a house or two and go to walking when you get too tired. Gradually increase the amount of houses you can jog before you stop. Eventually you'll be able to make a few tenths of a mile, and finally the whole thing.    Its a process but just like anything else its easiest if you break it up into small victories to make the end result easier
AA11522944	ANY persistent rectal (bum) bleeding should be referred to a doctor for proper diagnosis.    It could be something harmless... like a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds when you poop (eg a haemorrhoid) or a persistent wound that open up (anal fissure)... OR it could be something serious such as bowel cancer.    Generally if the blood is bright red and on the surface of the stool, it is most likely to be caused by a haemorrhoid or anal fissure.  Blood that is dark, or within the stool itself, is coming from further up the rectal passage and is more likely to be serious.    DO NOT use this advice as an excuse NOT to see a doctor.  Rectal bleeding is serious and self-diagnosis is dangerous. If you continue to bleed you should DEFINATELY see a doctor.  If he thinks it's necessary he will refer you to a specialist.. a bum doctor .. and they will do some tests.  Colonoscopy  a procedure where they take a look inside your colon using a tiny camera - is sometimes recommended to check for cancer.    Haemorrhoids or anal fissures are more likely to bleed if passing a stool (pooping) is difficult.  To help soften your stools make sure you have lots of fibre in your diet. Fibre comes from fruit, vegetables, wholemeal breads, wholegrain cereals etc. Take fibre supplements if necessary.      Go to the toilet regularly and DONT ignore the urge to poop - stools retained in the colon for too long become progressively drier, harder and more difficult to pass.  Drink lots of water so that you are adequately hydrated.    See the links below  http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2...  http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2...  http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2...  http://www.allhealth.com.au/html/s02_art...

BuJIQ8Jhaa	I had the same condition years ago.  The doctor prescribed a large bottle of vitamin "A".  It eventually went away and I really don't know if it was the A vitamin or time that healed it.  after three or four years it was gone.
ufgv7oTjaa	Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about that. If the tendon itself is bruised, it's unfortunately going to take more than a day for it to heal, even with assistance. It would be a good idea to get some Arnica gel to use for bruises like this (it can heal them quicker if you catch them right away sometimes) and I'd start applying it ASAP. It won't be fully healed by tomorrow, but it should be better than it is now. I know several people that have used it and I've talked to hundreds that have used it with great success. Good luck!
ZQZCJmD1aa	I just had two done :( and had the same experience. The temp is not a perfect fit like the permanant and the tooth may still be sore from the drilling for up to 2 weeks if it was deep enough. I wouldn't worry about it. I got the permanents a few weeks ago and again today, no problems since then.|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	Well it isn't supposed to fit or look like your permanent but it shouldn't be causing you any pain. Also anytime you get a crown, things feel different. I had a permanent crown put on and went back about 5 times because it just didn't feel right.
26wIVy7Saa	You know, instead of trying to play the system, you would be better served if you actually put some energy behind the many groups that are trying to decriminalize cannabis, and make medical marijuana legal on the national level. By putting energy into these groups I mean, joining them, donating some extra cash to them, following up on their action alerts, like writing to your elected representatives, which you can do online.     The following are links to these groups which have been working tirelessly to end this failed and damaging War on Drugs.    If you, and enough other folks take effective action, the laws will be changed, and you won't have to play the system. Plus, you will be helping a lot of legitimate medical cannabis users who are living under threat of arrest simply because they are using a medicine which makes their lives livable. And that is good karma.|`|FOCOywTfaa	I hate to break your heart but that doesn't sound logical at all. Just enjoy being a teenager. You're still sooo young.

I didn't feel the way you described, but medicine works so different for everyone.     Honestly, if your that concerned, call the ER and see if they think it would be wise for you to come in.  It sounds like the medicine doesn't work for you at all.  It's NOT supposed to have that effect on you, so don't take it again.    Good luck!|`|QHqPoAVSaa	First, I am sure that you are also seeing a therapist or you saw a doctor that spoke to you about some coping skills or some deescalating techniques.  Try lying in the middle of the floor and place one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach and slowly breathe in and out.  Try closing your eyes and humming or meditating.  Get yourself and a safe state of mind and just relax.  If you feel that none of this is working than you need to contact mobile crisis.  I would rather you contact mobile crisis no matter what so that they can report this to your doctor.  I once worked in the mental health field and Seroquel doesn't have that many side effects and is actually an excellent pill that if used properly will help you.  You need to talk to your doctor about coping skills and other alternatives that you can implement along with taking your prescribed medication as prescribed!|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	Anytime you have an adverse reaction to any medication, you need to seek medical help immediately.|`|AA10628838	You should discuss this with your doctor tomorrow as soon as you can.

IT MAKES YOU FEEL LESS HUNGRY INSTEAD OF GETTING THE URGE FOR FOOD BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU FEEL FULL. THIS IS A DANGEROUS PROCEDURE|`|5Qo6OWNzaa	it depends on your overall body fat composition. 5 to 7 lbs is what is considered safe for most lipo procedures.    edit - lipo removes fat cells which are removed permanantly.

xgrNAwa1aa	You have to recognize that even though you were not physically hit, you were abused. Abuse can cause Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and depression.   The "flashbacks" make me feel you are going through PTSD. You can not get over this alone and need to seek help to ever come out the other side. You do not have to feel this way the rest of your life.  No, you will never forget the abuse but you can get help that makes it possible for it to not be a constant thought on your mind.  Our fathers can cause us to have terrible relationships with men where we either seek someone else to abuse us or we ourselves can become abusive. Sometimes we just pick all the wrong men for many decades of life and that will only add to your burden.  Your self esteem was crushed at an early age because of the things your father told you that were not true and very hurtful.   It wouldn't surprise me one bit if he wasn't treated that way as a child by his own father or mother.  I also think as soon as you can that you need to remove yourself from that home that is so unstable. If your Dad still lives there from what I took, you can never fully escape it until you are out of there and in your own place.   I was more neglected by my Dad as a child but the aftermath is just as bad as if I were abused. Finally a counselor one day told me that I had been and that neglect was a form of abuse which I had never thought of that way before as I was in my mid 20's.  My Dad did leave when I was only 4. He lived close but never wanted to spend time with me or my sister. He paid child support but didn't want to be a big part of our lives. I always said to others that you don't miss what you never really had and my counselor told me that I never grieved him leaving like a death because to my 4yr old mind, it was.  I've never forgotten but I sought help, am doing much better and don't think much about all the bad anymore. Forgiveness is the key in the end though.   To forgive even if it is just in your mind and heart yet never spoken is to let go. You need to learn how to let go so you can have a much better life.|`|cfvAJJqdaa	you need to get a grip and stop feeling sorry for yourself.    there is barely one bad thing in there. just stop thinking about it.    people divorce. that's life. i can't believe you are actually complaining about such petty things as being snapped at one time over a book.

I know what you mean about traumatic things getting burnt into your mind, eating you up inside. Maybe you could talk to a therapist about them.    (Back when I was 6 my mom told me I was going to grow-up to be a wife-beater. And that's why I am a life-long bachelor. Because if I ever have kids, I would probably end up being someone like your father.)|`|m85emlXyaa	Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) is a clinically recognized condition that results from extended exposure to extremes of social and/or interpersonal trauma, including sexual abuse (especially child sexual abuse), physical abuse, emotional abuse, domestic violence, and torture. A differentiation between the diagnostic categorizations of C-PTSD and that of Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been suggested, as C-PTSD better describes the pervasive negative impact of chronic trauma than does PTSD alone.[1][2] As a descriptor, PTSD fails to capture some of the core characteristics of C-PTSD. These elements include psychological fragmentation, the loss of a sense of safety, trust, and self-worth, as well as the tendency to be revictimized, and, most importantly, the loss of a coherent sense of self. It is this loss of a coherent sense of self, and the ensuing symptom profile, that most pointedly differentiates C-PTSD from PTSD.[3]  Contents  [hide]        * 1 Symptom profile      * 2 Treatment      * 3 See also      * 4 Footnotes      * 5 References      * 6 External links    [edit] Symptom profile    C-PTSD is characterized by chronic difficulties in many areas of emotional and interpersonal functioning. Symptoms may include:[3][2]            * Difficulties regulating emotions, including symptoms such as persistent sadness, suicidal thoughts, explosive anger, or covert anger, which is characteristic of passive-aggressive behavior            * Variations in consciousness, such as forgetting traumatic events, reliving traumatic events, or having episodes of dissociation (during which one feels detached from one's mental processes or body)            * Changes in self-perception, such as a sense of helplessness, shame, guilt, stigma, and a sense of being completely different from other human beings            * Varied changes in the perception of the perpetrator, such as attributing total power to the perpetrator or becoming preoccupied with the relationship to the perpetrator, including a preoccupation with revenge            * Alterations in relations with others, including isolation, distrust, or a repeated search for a rescuer            * Loss of, or changes in, one's system of meanings, which may include a loss of sustaining faith or a sense of hopelessness and despair    [edit] Treatment    Treatment for C-PTSD tends to require a multi-modal approach.[4] It has been suggested that treatment for C-PTSD should differ from treatment for PTSD by focusing on problems that cause more functional impairment than the PTSD symptoms. These problems include emotional dysregulation, dissociation, and interpersonal problems.[5] Six suggested core components of complex trauma treatment include:[4]       1. Safety     2. Self-regulation     3. Self-reflective information processing     4. Traumatic experiences integration     5. Relational engagement     6. Positive affect enhancement    Multiple treatments have been suggested for C-PTSD. Among these treatments are group therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, eye movement desensitizations and reprocessing, and psychodrama. As C-PTSD is a fairly new concept, therapeutic protocols are just being developed.[6] Current medical care includes the use of SSRIs[citation needed], and sometimes the atypical antipsychotics[citation needed].    Since C-PTSD shares symptoms with both PTSD and borderline personality disorder,[7] it is likely that a combination of treatments utilized for these conditions would be helpful for an individual with C-PTSD, such as dialectic behavior therapy and exposure therapy|`|bPKLKi7haa	I didn't read the whole thing, but I do think I understand, at least most of how you feel. For some reason, it is much easier for me to remember bad memories than good ones. Occasionally I get frightened by past experiences, and I become afraid that it will interfere with me making my future. I don't know why I do this, where as these experiences were obviously not my fault, nor any one else I love. Sometimes I think I'm recalling memories, but I don't believe it's even possible that they are true. I feel like I'm remembering things from another life or something.  Look, just hang in there okay, and if anything, I would not hate your dad, but feel sorry for him, for he doesn't seem to realize what he's doing-how much of a joy it is to have a family, some people just let it all fall from beneath them....
FicyC2TXaa	No, studies haven't shown meat to be a cause of cancer. The causes of cancer are not yet known.    A diet HIGH in red and processed meat is a risk factor for colorectal cancers. A diet high in meat and fat may be a possible risk factor for pancreatic cancer. A diet high in red and processed meats is thought to be a possible risk factor for stomach cancer.    That's pretty much it for the recognised possible links between meat and the 200+ diseases that come under the umbrella title of 'cancer'    A risk factor isn't a cause; 'being male' is a recognised risk factor for heart disease, but being male doesn't cause heart disease.    I was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer after decades as a vegetarian and over 8 years as a vegan. I'm still a vegan and I'll remain one - but avoiding meat didn't stop me getting cancer, it didn't cure me and I'd be beyond foolish to expect it to prevent recurrence or metastasis|`|AA11020187	No there have not.

What medication works for one person might not work so well for someone else.
Ir2VI5lcaa	Take a bath as hot as you can stand it, stay there for 15 to 20 minutes. then after drying off, massage Icyhot onto the areas that are hurting. find the stiffest most painful part of the muscle and rub it firmly during the bath and while you apply the icyhot. You can even do the stretches in the tub.   do extra hamstring stretches before and after whatever you have to do tomorrow.  You may not be completely better by tomorrow, but these things will lessen the chance of hurting yourself worse.    Best of luck.|`|kj507W26aa	Massage your hamstrings.  They are tight or if your gym has a hot tub, get your legs in there for 20 minutes from the waist down. Hot tubs relax tight muscles after a workout and cut the soreness in half.|`|h2i7VIWLaa	Well, I found I good site on google that gave me good advice,     http://www.halhigdon.com/15Ktraining/Str...    You want to do stretch number 2, with the other ones too. It won't heal fast, so do NOT strain yourself, just read the website, it looks bad graphically but good tips. Just do not try to rest up for the whole night, it will stiffen the muscles. After some healing, do the stretches slow, maybe 10min tonight, 15 when you wake up, and 7 before you run. It won't heal fast, but your body can reconstruct itself. If it hurts while doing the stretches rest for awhile, then try again. And be sure to drink water, it nevers hurts

067fa6dfc93e782fff815f1abe45eebaaa	If you run an hour and 45min everyday your CERTAINLY getting enough exercise.  When you lose weight it isn't targeted. Your body decides where to burn the fat from.   As long as you take in less calories than burn (which is very likely with your exercise plan) then you WILL decrease your waistline and, if your arms are fatty, it will also decrease them.    Just make sure your only getting enough carbs, your body is going to go through alot of punishment with that much running and its going to need energy. Eat plenty of whole gains and FRUITS! Before and after you should be eating fruits!|`|aFzqYyLSaa	probably.

QtCQtXDVaa	Its sweet of you to want to help him. Hes going through life-altering moments right now. I think he could use a friend, but some people really draw back after such a profound loss. Dont take it personally if he doesnt react very much to you if you try to talk to him. Maybe one moment he will be happy you say something, maybe another moment he will hardly respond. You can also just look for his company in a silent way. Search for a comfortable silence within you when you are near him, he will notice it and be happy that someone can be around him that doesnt need him to talk or anything but looks for his company anyway. As a friend. Occasionally you could say that if he wants to, he can say whatever he wants to you. But he doesnt have to. Then leave it up to him, do something for yourself, sit with him and start reading a book or something. Or ask him if he wants to go for a walk or just lay in the sun in the grass. Just be around. Dont be too cheerful, try to radiate a certain peacefulness. And understanding. Respect for his feelings and emotions, whatever they may be. But don't be afraid to say something or make a joke if one comes up. About a daily thing. You have to stay close to yourself, not become stiff, stay natural, the modest-peaceful version of yourself. Hope that helps.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	I would get him a simply sympathy card.  Inside, I would say that I wanted to offer my condolences for the loss of his parent and if he would like someone to talk to, please feel free to contact me.   Basically, be simple, thoughtful, caring and open to a conversation.    Think about this.  If he were a girl, that you knew, and  had lost a parent and seemed sad and alone, how would you try to help her.  Work along the same lines.     When I lost my mother, I appreciated every kind word that was spoken to me and every thoughtful gesture.  It was really nice to have something like a card.  That would be something he could have with him and remind you that you are not alone.    Be open to do lots of listening.|`|Aj99vuqYaa	Be casual about talking to him. Don't mention his family. Don't treat him any different than you would if you had been friends with him before the death. Be real with him. Don't say "oh im soooooooo sorry about your mom/dad/stepmom/stepdad" because it wont do any good if he's constently talked to about it. If he brings it up, you could be like "oh, well i'm sorry to hear that. If you wanna talk, you can, if not, don't worry about it. Do what you want to do. Dont feel pressured into talkin about it."|`|QHqPoAVSaa	I lost a very close friend in 2007 and it still hurts to talk about it.  I can only speak about my experience and what I would love for people to do for me.  I want someone to be real and just to listen.  I want to know that I have someone to talk to about the situation and they have the ability to listen rather than try to help or give me advice.  Often people just need someone to listen to them and to not give advice or to add in their experience.  My advice to you is to let that person know that you are there for them whenever they want to talk.  I would not try to make that person laugh all the time because that only creates happiness for the moment.  Don't try to cheer the person up or create some facade.  Just be yourself and let him know that you will listen whenever he is ready to share!  Good Luck...

If you still have problems I would suggest going to the doctor and asking for a blood prego test.

Your first day will consist of all the fruits you want. It is strongly suggested that you consume lots of melons the first day. Especially watermelon and a loupe. If you limit your fruit consumption to melons, your chances of losing three lbs. on first day are very good.     DAY 2:: All vegetables. You are encouraged to eat until you are stuffed with all the raw or cooked vegetables of your choice. There is no limit on the amount or type. For your complex carbohydrate, you will start day two with a large baked potato for breakfast. You may top the potato with one pat of butter.     DAY 3:: A mixture of fruits and vegetables of your choice. Any amount, any quantity. No bananas yet. No potatoes today.     DAY 4:: Bananas and milk. Today you will eat as many as eight bananas and drink three glasses of milk. This will be combined with the special soup which may be eaten in limited quantities.     DAY 5 ::Today is feast day. You will eat Paneer and tomatoes. Eat two 10 oz. portions of lean Paneer. Hamburger is OK. Combine this with six whole tomatoes. On day five you must increase your water intake by one quart. This is to cleanse your system of the uric acid you will be producing.     DAY 6 :: Paneer and vegetables. Today you may eat an unlimited amount of Paneer and vegetables. Eat to your hearts content.     DAY 7:: Today your food intake will consist of brown rice, fruit juices and all the vegetables you care to consume.    Tomorrow morning you will be 10-17 lbs. lighter than one week ago. If you desire further weight loss, repeat the program again. You may repeat this program as often as you like, however, it is suggested that you are allowed two glasses of white wine in addition to the instructions on the program. You may substitute champagne for white wine. Under no circumstances are you to drink any other alcoholic beverages with the exception of beer which is allowed. Any liquor (bourbon,vodka, rum) is forbidden. Cream drinks are especially forbidden. You may have an occasional cordial such as creme de menthe or schnapps, but you must always limit yourself to two drinks. If you wine, drink only wine that day. If you have beer, drink only beer that day, etc. Alcohol adds empty calories to your diet. However, after the first week it will help your digestion and settle your stomach.|`|X9QOHRLFaa	hi the truth is only way to effectively and permanently loose weight is by working out and eating right , well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call. it really helped me alot , hope it does the same for you    www.xattack.in|`|t9hJQknUaa	please use the herballife nutrition tablets and powder

But knowing what I know, THE diet is really no secret. It has many faces. It can be Southbeach for one person, Atkins for another, Weight watchers or Jenny Craig for another or simply eating smaller portions and excercising for someone else. Its what YOU can live with because its a matter of changing your eating and excercise habits for a lifetime.

aOmDuXubaa	the best way to lose weight is to control your appetite and the best way to do that that I know of is with hoodia.  It's not a diet pill either.  It's an all natural supplement.  When I was dieting (and believe me I still watch my weight even though I have achieved my weight loss goals for the most part) I realized right off that the most important thing is to control your appetite.  If your stomach's not always growling and your not always craving food it is sooo much easier to stick to your guns and stay on your diet.  With hoodia I would literally go a whole day sometimes and simply forget to eat and I didn't get tired and run down like diets can sometimes make you feel.  Once my appetite was under control and I wasn't always thinking about eating then and only then could the weight start coming off consistently and steadily because the hoodia kept my mind off of food and I would go longer on my diet and as I did that naturally I lost weight.  You have to remember that consistency is very important when losing weight.  If you cut back a little on your food consumption everyday your body will change (stomach will shrink and you won't be eating as much) and with that consistency over a few days, weeks and months you will lose weight just like I did.  Hoodia was my saving grace for all of these factors.  Hope this helps!!!|`|hpadhXUiaa	First check out what is your blood group and what diet is good for your health .

You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.

Not that they should take their life, but that it would have been taken, or that they would have never existed.    Everyone was born with a purpose. It is their job to see that they make it worth something. If someone is hated by the world they can still serve a purpose. Their pain can help people, it can inspire people, and it can give other people hope who feel the same way.     Years ago I was depressed and about ready to kill myself. I kept hearing about al of these teens in town her were killing themselves. Once one did it set off a chain. Just the fact that they did that brought others who were feeling depressed to kill themselves also. Now that I'm better, I look back on it and see how negative I was. If I would have just made the most of what I had, even though it wasn't much. My best friend did save my life and I'll be forever grateful, but now I can use that pain from my past, and those experinces to reach out to other people.    If someone's life is a living hell, they can still help someone even if they never know it. If my best friend would have gave in and killed himself before I was able to meet him, I would be dead as well.     Continuing life is certainly not fruitless. You don't know what you could experince once things get better. Everyone I've talked to who has gotten over being suicidle and depressed, is so much happier about their life now, and they said that they would never kill themselves because now they see how it would have hurt people.|`|A9j7ahwsaa	you know what? life is what you make it. there is no justification for suicide. how do you know people won't miss you, what about your parents? cowards kill themselves, you may think its the easy way out but what about the people you leave behind. they will blame themselves. if you don't like the path your life is taking change it. get away from the **** in you life, only you can stop it bringing you down, this dark time in your life is just a very small moment in time. once you turn the corner and look back you'll realize just how small it was.you can go through life with your head down saying woe is me, my life sucks, or you can chin up and say **** you i want to live and show you that i'm worthwhile and the rest of you can blow me. the choice is yours find something you like to do and enjoy yourself. be the best that you can be.|`|XLHrIFA4aa	No I don't.

ZIq2IzOmaa	The male body has what's called the "refractory period". This is the length of time between orgasm and the next time a man can get an erection.     The usual procedure for penises is: get an erection, orgasm, not be able to become erect for a period of time, and then be ready to go.     How long this period lasts varies from man to man. It's also dependant on your physical condition, age, and other more esoteric factors.     The best you can do to shorten this time is to keep in decent shape, eat well, sleep enough, and stay healthy.     Also if you spend time playing with your partner while you're waiting for another erection, there won't be pressure on you to perform right away. The more you focus on getting an erection right now, the more difficult it can be. So paying attention to her can be a good way to fill up that hour while you wait.     By the way, an hour is not an unusually long time. Yes there are speedier guys in the world, but an hour isn't outrageous.|`|wd893RR8aa	This is known as the refractory period.

Make sure you are getting enough essential vitamins such as Vit D and Calcium. These promote strong bones and strong enamel.   You can also rinse with an over the counter flouride rinse, ACT restoring is one example. Your DDS can prescribe you a high flouride toothpaste, usually 5000 parts per million, Prevident is an example.   Chewing gum with Xytiol can help.

Researchers have used animal models and have successfully shown that the type 2 pneumocytes if injected in suspension form repair the damaged alveolar or lung tissue.  These studies are still in initial phases and it will take some time before a viable stem cell treatment for lung fibrosis becomes available.  Natural remedies like aloe vera juice have been found to help with the symptom of pulmonary fibrosis.  Hope this helps!    Regards,  Noopur|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	www.webmd.com and look it up for yourself...shouldn't you have discussed this with your Dr ???|`|AA10126712	First of all, we're sorry to hear that you've been touched by this disease.  You probably have heard from your doctor that there's really no cure for the disease.  My father-in-law passed away last February from the disease. Doctors told us he had possible 3 years, he passed away in 1.    There's steroid treatments, etc.  Sometimes it lessens the symptoms, but doesn't really do anything to reverse the disease.    Here are a couple of sites that provide herbs that may help.  My father-in-law took the herbs but we think it was a little too late.  The disease progressed very rapidly.  Try anything you can.  Don't give up.  Doctors won't tell you about this stuff.  It can't hurt.  Good Luck!    http://www.biomediclabs.com/pulmonary_fi...  http://www.health-reports.com/pulmonary-...
bQ4RAi07aa	Fracture of the scaphoid usually happens from a fall on an outstretched hand, with the weight landing on the palm. The end of one of the forearm bones (the radius) may also break in this type of fall, depending on the position of the hand on landing. Pain and swelling in the wrist will usually cause a person with a scaphoid fracture to see a doctor so please see one asap.    Fractures of the scaphoid occur in people of all ages, including children. The injury often happens during sports activities or a motor vehicle accident.    Use of wrist guards during activities like inline skating and snowboarding can decrease the chance of breaking a bone around the wrist.|`|AA10287830	It sounds like you have a broken bone.  Ice it for 15 min then apply heat for 15, and on and on.  Before you sleep wrap it with an Ace bandage, but not too tightly.  I hope you have good news at the DRs.  I broke my wrist/arm twice and it's very uncomfortable.  If you need a cast, ask for one you can take on and off.  It makes taking a shower and grooming a lot easier.  Take care.|`|ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	You may have broken the ulnar, scaphoid bone or both- its a common injury when you stop a fall with an outstretched arm.  There's not much harm in waiting until tomorrow, but sometimes swelling can make it difficult to get a good image of the injury.|`|m38IqHKaaa	ice elevate and tape it and get yourself to the drs as soon as poss    sound like a break|`|JL0Pqw9Xaa	You probably broke a small bone in there  somewhere..some type of fracture. I mean  your forearm where it connects with your  wrist joints.Compound fracture maybe. I  broke both arms just that way you described  when falling off a bicycle and your symptoms match mine..I'm sorry but I think  its cast time..Maybe I'm wrong. Good luck
piI1aWOdaa	whats my name?|`|8pw8qDjPaa	are you on birth control? if not, you could just be having irregular periods. maybe consult your doctor and get on birth control to manage it better (it will also be a better way of protection when it comes to sex, cuz pulling out is NOT a good or responsible option if you're trying to avoid getting pregnant... and seriously its cheap! mine is only $10 a month)     but first take an at home pregnancy test or go talk to your doctor and make sure you're not pregnant before going on the pill.

C4v4BuS6aa	Yeah, it's called MANstruation.|`|VinxvzXcaa	Golly geez!!  I've heard that too and know the answer :D  Guys can't have a period as in the eggs and uterus and all that crap.  BUT like girls there is one time in the month were something does happen in a way it's like a period but like i said it doesn't have anything to do with all that stuff, they can just be REALLY silly, and get pissed easily and be very moody.   So the answer is yes! But very different from girls but similar as in the way they act :D    Don't listen to the people who say NO cause it does happen once a month with out them noticing sorta thing.      Although little research has been done on the topic, men have monthly  cycles, too.     In 1929, a researcher carefully followed the moods of seventeen men  and showed that men, like women, have emotional cycles of about a  month to six weeks in length. According to the researchers findings,  men tend to be more apathetic and indifferent during the low period of  their emotional cycles and more likely to magnify small problems into  big ones. During the high period of their cycles, men have more  energy, a greater sense of well-being, lower body weight, and less  need for sleep.    Some scientists think female hormones affect men, causing a male  monthly syndrome, through pheromones.     Do men have periods. Obviously not, considering they lack a uterus  and the other pipes necessary for that monthly female event. But ask  any woman if her male partner has monthly PMS and you'll get an  emphatic yes. These women even have the days marked on the calendar  when their hubbies start the classic bloating, sensitivity, cravings  for strange food, and overall bitchy behavior.  Now, ask a man if he has PMS and he'll most likely look at you as if  you've been watching too much Oprah. But occasionally a few rare men  will fess up and admit that during a certain time each month -- and  for no good reason -- they feel out of sorts? maybe even a little blue  or sensitive. Some even report to having changes in their facial hair  or sensitivity to smells.      BUT none of this has been fully proved and scientists are not fully sure about all this either yet. But in most cases it seems believable.    Wanna know more contact me its all on my page.  Hope i helped in some way or another! :D      Cheers, Em.|`|55G0BNCzaa	lol. no.|`|NwGDlZl1aa	yes there called erections|`|zQQd2wPRaa	you wish!|`|B8e8x60Saa	no you dont.. but when you get a bit too excited.. you might discharge a bit of semen... this might be to what your friend is referring to... and ppl dont be harsh... he asked a question... obviously he dont know.. so go easy :)|`|zzPy8s9baa	I heard it to, what they mean by this is our "mood swings" once thought that only women get mood swings on a monthly basis.

If she's happy, don't worry about it.  If you get the sense she isn't, then introduce some new sex toys or different things to mix up the sex a little.  There are benefits to a small penis actually.  Giving oral is more enjoyable and so is other stuff if you know what I mean.  But as long as you can make her orgasm, size is pretty irrelevant.|`|gsS0c3yVaa	get a real petite girlfriend.

7GrVCiWKaa	You didn't say what your pain med is.  However, I worked in the hospital and we often gave Ambien and the patient's pain meds together.  It didn't matter if it was Vicodan, Lortab, Lorcet, Percocet, Morphine, Demerol, etc.  Let's face it, if you are in pain then the Ambien is going to be less effective in helping you sleep.  I am sorry to hear that you have a kidney stone.  I hear that they are extremely painful.  Take your pain meds and go to bed.  Hopefully you can get some sleep tonight.|`|AA10287830	Yes I think you can safely take something for pain after the Ambien.  I take it and then have to take hydrocodone afterwards.  You really should call your doctors office and ask.  I'm not a professional and I doubt anyone on here is either.  I take it without any ill effects but it may be different for you.  I hope you are pain free soon and it turns out to be something more simple than kidney stones.|`|odiTRvpvaa	i take ambien every night.. it seems to be very mild. you should always check with your doctor. but i don't see any problem in taking a couple a tylenol extra strength.|`|3VKTFOURaa	idk but all i know is your never supposed to mix pills.|`|bQ4RAi07aa	You may need a lower dose of zolpidem (generic Ambien)  if you take other medicines that make you sleepy (such as cold medicine, pain medication, muscle relaxants, and medicine for depression or anxiety). Tell your doctor if you are currently taking any of these medications.  Before taking zolpidem, tell your doctor about all other medications you use, especially:  itraconazole (Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral)   rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane, Rifater); or   antidepressants such as imipramine (Janimine, Tofranil), or sertraline (Zoloft)|`|jplrg1oJaa	If it's just an over the counter pain reliever it might be okay. However, with kidney issues it's best not to take an ibuprofen based medicine as this is processed via the kidneys and can be hard on them.     I recommend you call a pharmacist, preferably the one who filled the prescription for you, but any licensed pharmacist can help. There are a lot of 24 hour drug stores around now so you might be able to find one open in your area. When it comes to medication, your pharmacist is the best choice.  Not to say doctors are bad, you could also ask your doctor, but pharmacists tend to be more readily available at odd hours.|`|9E502jsuaa	-Naah your not suppose to take any pain meds after you take ambiens. Due , to the fact that your pains meds -side effects could not mix well with taking ambien. If your pain gets worst you should contact your doctor and tell him the situation about you taking ambiens.

If this is occurring before or after your period, all it is is your body cleaning out the remaining blood.|`|iTP5CNtuaa	Your body can take a long time to get back to normal. When I got off depo finally I remember having that because my body was just trying to have normal cycles. It takes a long time.

AA10448886	hello     post-acne(pimples) pigmentation is common ,     you can do a lot of things to avoid pigmentation circles,    first concentrate on natural methods like drinking lot of water which nourishes your skin and can lighten the pigmentation spots on your face-cheeks.    along with plenty of water drinking you may apply zincort cream ( a thin film over the pigmentation circles) before sleep in night for 3 nights,     are you allergic to any medicines like hydroquinone, if no then , following zincort cream for 3 nights , begin applying   'ESLITE'(hydroquinone) cream(costing abt Rs.25),apply twice a day for 8 days,eslite is for external use only. Wash your hands before and after applying this medication.Apply the medication to clean, dry skin. Apply just enough medication to cover the affected area. Avoid applying to the unaffected surrounding skin. Rub in the medication gently and completely.If any side effects occur with eslite, such as difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat,Stop using eslite topical and call your doctor if you have severe burning, stinging, or other irritation of your skin after apply the medication.    Retinio-A is good for skin pigmentation following pimples,  0.01-0.1% cream/gel/solution on the affected area 1-2 times a day for a week,Avoid contact with eyes.    you may also use chemical peels(chemical peeling with trichloroacetic acid or glycolic acid) at cosmetologist.    a good and natural method of toning skin of face is to rub a piece of potato over your face and neck and wash it off after 15 mins.    Sun screens containing titanium dioxide should be used to prevent further pigmentation and increase in severity of existing pigmentation.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	Ask your beautician or look for a laser cosmetic clinic.

I wouldn't recommend running off to the emergency room every time something weird happens. If more serious symptoms emerge than your hands feeling weird, then take them into consideration... If you feel strongly that i am wrong, don't let me stop you. Your health is a serious matter, as is anyone's. But, i don't think you've got anything to worry about based on that bit of information you've given me. Perhaps if there are medical facilities on your campus you should visit there first, as an intermediary step. Not quite a trip to the ER, but at least it's medical attention. Again, that's if you feel you need it. It could just go away, but it could also be a foreshadow of something else also. It's really hard to say.

I had back surgery in 04 and put on some weight because I was laying on my back recovering for a while. My buddy mark is practically a personal trainer although not certified or anything, just that he;s really up on all the latest fitness and nutrition supplements and stuff. Anyhow, I asked him what to do and he told me he heard good things about hoodia. I did some research and found out the desert burn was one of the best. I got some and took it on the first day and literally forgot to eat. My appetite is very strong I might ad so when i forget to eat it's kind of a minor miracle. So I took it for a couple of months and my will power was very high and I dropped 33 pounds in just a couple of months and it didn't even seem like I was dieting. I was so psyched about feeling better and losing the weight that I started my own website dedicated to back health, diet tips and all around wellness. You asked, I'm telling you. try hoodia. It worked like a charm for me. If you want, cut and paste: online health desert burn hoodia :into your GOOGLE search and you can read all about how I did it complete with before and after pics (the same pic on my profile I might ad) and just tons of good diet and nutrition advice from a guy that lived it and still does.

Once my friend of mine asked to help out her because she decided to become more fit.

Many patents and testimonials are proving their quality.  Each of them was made from an extract of a different plant. It took a few days I found a website telling the difference and the weightloss potential between them.    My friend has chosen Proactol pills. I asked her how much she was losing and it was like 2,5 lbs per week. Just like the website speaks.     Now it's up to You.
