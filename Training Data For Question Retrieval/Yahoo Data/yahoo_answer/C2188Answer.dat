caOfuKl5aa	I'm not sure if you've ever played a Sims game on a console, but it's not the same as on the computer.  There is a lot less stuff you can do in the console version.  But you play as the human, you can switch to the pets, but you don't controll them yourself.|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	No it is not like the version on pc....its totally different on the pc you cant control the pets you can only control the humans....but we can click on them to see wht they need such as their needs...but the sims 2 pets is fun no matter wht game console you have you just miss out on a few options thats all|`|eadN4IZwaa	You can only control humans. Sorry. But it still has allot of fun stuff to buy. Also you can not have a baby, age or WooHoo. Agian sorry.|`|q02UN23aaa	I have it for PS2. I like it better than playing on the computer. You cant control the pets, but you do have to check up on them to make sure their needs are being fulfilled.
16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	As  teacher of kids in chess I've seen it too often.<br>  <br>  As kids they are 50-50, then hit puberty.<br>  <br>  The boys stay on, but the girls discover boys.  For some reason girls think that success is "unfeminine."  That and they think if they beat a boy that boy will not like them.<br>  <br>  I've told them that boys  don't care.  In fact a girl that tries to play and does it well is impressive and attracts more than just from the waist down.<br>  <br>  No effect  As a guy I obviously do not know how guys think.:)|`|367fab9d43fcf7b1344d395539e01be8aa	This answer contains several gross over generalizations.  I have tried to use the words "many" and "tend" so as to not brush with quite such a broad stroke.<br>  <br>  Consider the history of the world for a second.  Until quite recently (in relative terms), women were considered "inferior" to men, and therefore "unworthy" of using their brains for any substantive task.  Times have changed, and there are now, in fact, some female chess Grandmasters, probably with Judit Polgar as among the most well known today.  Still, there currently exists separate titles for women from men even within chess, assuming that women only play women and men only play men, an assumption Polgar is particularly not fond of given the equality question we are talking about here.  (She earned her title playing exclusively against other men.)  WGM (for woman grandmaster), WFM (for woman FIDE master), and WIM (not sure what the I stands for....International, maybe?, but anyway, it's a title given to somebody who has not yet competed in and scored well enough in an appropriate number of "norms", i.e., very strong chess tournaments) are titles which are in use in the chess world with reference to women (as opposed to GM, FM, and IM respectively).  <br>  <br>  Anyway, to answer your question, my guess is that even today, many women feel that following in the path of a thinking and strategising game is something they would rather not pursue.  Women tend to be more "feeling" oriented while men tend to be more "action" and "competition" oriented.  If "winning" might mean hurting somebody else's feelings, I suppose that could be a significant hindrance to women wishing to pursue playing chess for fear of winning and therefore hurting somebody's feelings.  <br>  <br>  This is all pure conjecture on my part, and what do I know since I'm a guy anyway.  I still hope my thoughts are useful.|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	Because it doesn't involve shoe shopping!|`|UVUYG5jaaa	women don't play because your not allowed to talk|`|Nz8KQfQTaa	"Reuben Fine was a prominent chess-player during the thirties, who competed in the famous AVRO tournament of 1938. He also had considerable experience in psychoanalysis, and in 1956 the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis published his work, The Psychology of the Chess Player. The book gives a very Freudian account of the game of chess, and is useful only to demonstrate the advances that have been made in the realm of psychology with respect to chess within the past forty years.<br>  <br>  Fine claimed that chess is a substitute for war. The king is held to represent the father, while the queen is the mother. In addition, the rook, bishop, knight and pawn are taken to be phallic symbols.8 Fine draws a lot of significance from the fact that promoted pawns may become any other piece except for the king/father. This restriction implies to Fine that chess-playing boys are discouraged from growing up to be like their fathers. Unfortunately Fine's analysis suffers from its entirely armchair nature. There are no experiments or observations, other than a few biographies of well-known grandmasters to support the hypotheses presented in the book. One consistency in Fine's work is that master chess players all have differing personalities and backgrounds"<br>  <br>  <br>          this was an article on Reuben Fine the number 2 player in the world in the 40s he retired to become a psychologist    basically he says the king is the father and the goal of the game is to checkmate (kill) your father so you can have your mother all to yourself               this is called oedipus complex<br>  a term created from freud. Obviously females do not fall under this catagory so if freud ddnt have a screw loose (wich is till this day up to debate) than that could be a possible explanation

fVAApgMXaa	Well, one thing you could do is cut out earthquake photos of difference sizes, glue them to L-shaped bits of cardboard (to help them stand up) and build a diorama of a city under siege of natural disaster.  You could also do a collage of text, true-person accounts, as a wallpaper back drop.  I don’t know what is used nowadays for materials; when I used to do these, it was paper, scissors, toys, paint and an old shoebox.  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Diorama" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Diorama</a><br>  <br>  (All due respect to those who endured the subsequent Northridge earthquake, which by many accounts was far worse)… but: I, and about 7 million others, were in the (7.1) 1989 Loma-Prieta which affected the San Francisco Bay Area.  The  epicenter was near Loma Prieta peak in the Santa Cruz mountains (about 60 miles south of the city), where it ripped the earth open a good 8 feet <br>  <a href="http://www.yuprocks.com/earthquake_pictures/loma_prieta_earthquake_3.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.yuprocks.com/earthquake_pictu...</a><br>  <br>  Many people lost friends in the terrible collapse of the Cypress Freeway in Oakland (approach to the Bay Bridge), in building pancakes <br>  <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?f=/c/a/2006/04/18/MNGQIMPACT18.DTL&o=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/art...</a> <br>  and under collapsed brick facades, so I well-remember most of these photos  <br>  <a href="http://pro.corbis.com/search/Enlargement.aspx?CID=isg&mediauid=%7B18535B88-EA3E-4E44-93BC-BA0205F578D0%7D" rel="nofollow">http://pro.corbis.com/search/Enlargement...</a> <br>  But it’s the images of the freeway and the fires that (still) “get” me… some people just didn’t have a chance...  so many others worked so hard to help.  The distance between the two still hurts.  Of course, it wasn't just us here in San Francisco.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJSdsJTHuXE#" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJSdsJTHu...</a><br>  Do a search for images for Loma Prieta, Santa Cruz.<br>  <br>  It’s difficult to communicate how everything so quickly ground to a halt: in 15 seconds there was no electricity, no phones, no buses, no trolley, no power to underground trains - that's where I was (still think that train conductor should be knighted for how he handled communication and got us out). Such terrible fires - no pumps for water except for what was on trucks or by running hose to tugboats on the Bay, which they did.  <a href="http://www.1000wordsphotos.com/lomaprieta/hoselay.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.1000wordsphotos.com/lomapriet...</a><br>  <br>  As the sun went down: no street lights, no light from buildings and dust so thick in the air that as night fell, you (literally) could not see a hand in front of your face.  Densely black. People helped each other everywhere – I could write a book... as could anyone from that time; everyone's got a story.  I’m (still) grateful to the men there who ferried me across the six lanes at Army & Mission.  A car coming out of that dense absence of light was like a bullet; crossing a Army @ Mission (six lanes) was a death race I wouldn’t wish on anyone.  People cued up – I didn’t get it – then OH! these men suddenly appeared, breathless, with women, children, (and even other men) in tow.  My turn came and they grabbed me under my arms and RAN me faster that I could have ever moved on my own – and still, we only just made it with a phantom-2-tons-of-steel whooshing way too close out of the night.  <br>  <br>  After a few more blocks, I know I’m out of the shopping district as the crunch of broken glass under foot was lighter.  People helped so much and inbetween it was more quiet than you could ever imagine. Out of the pitch, a group of teens, leading an even larger group of younger children (in the opposite direction) reminded me how I could find my way.  I’d kneel down to trace my fingers along the street names impressed in the sidewalk cement, as I found my way for about 3-1/2 miles away from downtown to my daycare to find my young son. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/63586087@N00/2534306002" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com/photos/63586087@N00/25...</a> <br>  When I made it the bottom of the last hill to climb I could barely make out a flicker of light. There was a man on the hill swinging a lantern, calling out: "follow my voice, the children are here, they are safe".  I was so grateful; still am.<br>  <br>  The US Geological Survey (USGS) has much earthquake information, including a large photo library.  <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learning/photos.php" rel="nofollow">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learning/phot...</a>  On this photo-directory page are the names of specific earthquakes.

October 17, 1989 at 05:04pm Pacific Time the whole nation (tuned to baseball) watched Candlestick Stadium rock. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YkPughdDWE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YkPughdD...</a> <br>  <br>  God bless those who didn't make it... but remember everyone who helped - be sure to put that in there.

fb20030bb066bcc4d66ec6d599cf3c42aa	The Elite Four is at a much higher level than even your Groudon. I would recommend leveling up all of your pokemon until at least level 70. I realise this is a pain, I spent two hours last night trying to level up my Sneasel. But, yes, I wouldn't recommend using the Regi's. You should probably get a dragon-type Pokemon and a Fire-type pokemon.|`|QJwaagGWaa	Ok, it would have helped if you told us the moves that they know, but you definately need to train your pokemon more. I suggest like at Lev 55-60 and then you challenge them. You might want to get a Fighting type pokemon, it will help you beat the First member, the third member, respectively, and even the Champion, since he has rock and steel pokemon. You definately need an Ice Pokemon, or a Dragon Pokemon, or Teach your Swampert some Ice Moves and OWN the Fourth Member of the Elite four since his pokemon are all dragon. Registeel will do well with The Ghost elite four, since he is resistant to ghost moves, but Regirock, lets just replace him......<br>  <br>  Ok, you know what to do..|`|4EZbkQ1kaa	you might have trouble with the ice type member which can deal alot of damage to groudon and regirock since none of your team has strenght against ice except registeel but his best steel type move is weak so replace a couple of the regis i suggest salamance and a fighting type (any would do fine)>other than that just traine them|`|anbYYwv4aa	ye sit is not good to use the three regi...<br>  <br>  use a psychic, ground, ice, fire pokemon<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ruby pokemon eliteis very easy...<br>  indigo plato is 3-4 times harder|`|fS8joiTaaa	Alakazam ftw simple as that he has a super high sp atk so get his sp atk up and use psychic and shadow ball and own everybody.|`|sLgI3cRpaa	it seems pretty strong to me once dey all are done training

MnEHO9u9aa	look u noob<br>  <br>  http://tinyurl. com/bhvpjl|`|1c0f793db881cd47badc0d00bd5bd1caaa	Maybe some indication of what operating system processing power and graphics card might be helpful in making an educated guess when it comes to fault finding, you could be playing on anything from a PS1 to a quad core mega-machine so it would be sheer luck if I said maybe you have virus software running in the background which  was conflicting with something else and was right.  I would like to help but you give no information and that is probably why you get idiot replies.|`|a5X8k2xYaa	What's up with this SIM game is it like a female sex game or something?|`|tHFY2hg4aa	Need more details. First of all, does EP mean expansion pack? When you said that you downloaded patches, does that mean extra items and mod files?<br>  First of all, mods or no mods, if you are having issues with the game running smoothly, reduce your screen resolution and other graphic settings in the options menu of the game. Unless you are running a video card with VRAM higher than 128, then it is going to be jumpy unless you tweak the settings.<br>  If the problems started after you downloaded extra stuff from a sims web-site, then one of those downloads might have a glitch.<br>  I noticed that you are using windows Vista. Update to service pack 2 on support.microsoft.com. Make sure you know which version of Vista you have (32-bit, or 64-bit) and download the english version.<br>  If none of that works, and you have already completely re-installed the game, then your computer is just not going to do the job. Like I said, I don't know the specs on your PC because you didn't give allot of info.|`|GOgffK8kaa	It's those damned jiggaboos.<br>  Joey's an idiot.

eRcEmjl5aa	Sometimes SL is moody like that. It's probably not you. Check the grid status here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://status.secondlifegrid.net/" rel="nofollow">http://status.secondlifegrid.net/</a><br>  <br>  It will tell you if TPs are not working properly. Also, if you can't teleport for a short time don't rez anything important!!! You may lose it!<br>  <br>  If you can't TP after a long time, contact SL, but for now, SL can go all spazzy for hours at a time. You may just have to wait.|`|KNYF1hnhaa	Ahhh yes the wonderful SL grid issues.  Those issues are the reason I dont go in as much as I did before.  Get used to them as they happen multiple times a week because the grid is unstable and they are too worried about new features and buying out businesses created by residents that actually work so that they can break them.

Ino Yamanaka can control the enemy<br>  4.Shikamaru Nara can Freeze someone by using his shadow, e can also strangle someone using that<br>  5. rasengan and chidori are both very powerful, and chidori's power grows with speed<br>  <br>  so, plain and simple, even tho im a huge fan of Sonic, They can't beat the Naruto group|`|9638ae734fc0be73b07743a185818d6caa	sonic would win
W5NGNo0oaa	to tell you the truth, i didn't really like it.|`|Npi4QR7Maa	It's pretty good.<br>  the best part about it is its storyline. Its really gritty and has a good realistic feeling to it.<br>  But its not worth all of the Game of the Year awards its been getting.|`|zkscW8seaa	When you say downloading, I assume you are getting the PC version. Anyway, yes, GTA IV is a kickass game, where never ending fun never ends. I play it all the time when I got time to kill. Since you are downloading it though, it may run slower than an actual copy of the game, and the PC version has had the most issues. But nonetheless, this game rocks. I've played it nearly everyday since the day I got it, no foolin'.|`|lOuz0nU2aa	Yeah, it's worth it.<br>  Good gameplay, allright graphics.|`|kB7pHahLaa	OMG;<br>  Yuppppp. (:<br>  Loveee ittttttt.|`|oxdCtZMBaa	yes i play it at least once everyday it is worth it the multiplayer is great too|`|EKj4PH76aa	to tell you the truth, i didn't really like it.
xdYX9DLCaa	so its either u divide your xp in half on both skillz with longrange attacks (this takes twice the time it would have taken)....or your gonna hally like me, since i no range ppl hate geting there def up. but THE FASTEST WAY TO DO IT IS WITH MELEE.... now you can do pest control and soul wars and exchange your points for def lvl... <br>  <br>  hope this helped =D|`|7duq22qtaa	thats really the only way to do it unless u melee|`|lOuz0nU2aa	Sorry, but you can't.<br>  You're going to have to use long range or use defence melee.
9kidx0Ykaa	I think it was Street Rage not Street Fighter. The special move was a Cop car would come and shoot a Bomb and fire would surround the enemies and bosses.

g6DrGhk7aa	Well I wanna start by saying that you gotta be (no offense) stupid to pay for a Club Penguin membership. It's internet robbery. But anyway on to the answer, I think all outfits are good, but since I'm a hip hop fan I prefer a brown colored penguin, black hoodie, sun glasses, a red cap, sporty foot wear and something around the neck to be the equivalent of a golden chain.

So I called yesterday and the employee told me they had just received a shipment & as we spoke they were opening the box. So needless to say, I have one on the way priority mail. Just keep in touch and I will give you a definite answer on either tuesday or wednesday when I receive the tool. I know I didn't answer your question but i'm in the same boat, minus the fact I have one on the way. Later

027237b8181b48ed9c0a4c5b517ac1f9aa	The nintendo Wii. First off yes ps 3 has a motion sensor in it but it's nothing compared to the wii It's only for like say your playing a racing game and your turning left and in the process you lean to the left  it'll help you turn a little better. Ok now Listen ANY TRUE GAMER KNOWS graphics don't make the game it's all about the game play Graphics are a plus ok. I think the Wii's gonna be the one to go with cuz there so many possibilities Because of the Wii-mote and not to metion you can download a lot of your old favorites from nes snes n64 turbo graphix and sega and it backwards compatible with the gamecube games. It also has a free internet  it's own weather channel and you can put your pics and home movies on it and edit your them also . Go with the wii and no I'm not a fanboy I'm Neutral I'm buying them all. But the ps 3 will have to drop in price not rich :(|`|94fb298c446e5d96417a65a80d743309aa	More better? It should just be better. I think the PS3 will be better. The Wii is innovative, but your arm would get tired after an hour or so, not to mention the PS3 controller has the same motion sensor thing in it too, plus the PS3 will be able to play both PS1 and PS2 games along with Blu-ray and DVD discs, and have a free internet browser to browse the internet.|`|edcae657154a0330cf86bab34f76a95baa	Wii.  Innovative, creative, and half the price!!  Its only $250, PS3 will be either $500 or $600 depending on the package you buy... And each game will be about $70!

mHWsuqjZaa	well , you are running jinzo so why would you use so many traps? Most decks try to avoid more than 5 traps if they have a jinzo in it and you're running 10! i wouldn't use those traps anyway.. kinda pittiful.

7WERsxEgaa	i'll give you a real answer, and my answer is for u 2 make glads instead. The reasoning is for the future. In the march 1st 2009 forbidden list(yes i have already seen it), tele-dad is totally destroyed and since tele-dad was pretty much the main reason 2 build little city i guess that means little city isn't as effective. Although it could be effective against lightsworn..................Oh yeah, and the biggest problem with building little city is that reinforcements of the army is going 2 be limited to 1!<br>  <br>   BUT there is a HUGE problem with building glads right now, and it is that GB Bestari is going 2 be limited to 1! That means that both decks aren't that good after march 1st IMO but glads r still better!|`|RxSTyhXmaa	That's a tough one, I'd hold on to them for a little longer if I were you.<br>  <br>  Unlike most Trading Card Games, Rarer cards form YuGiOh can be worth a pretty penny if kept in good condition. I mean, YuGiOh cards have an "Ultra Rare" category that really does speak the truth for the cards.<br>  <br>  People WILL pay 25.00+ for individual cards that are worth it.<br>  <br>  You should do some Self appraising and see what they're worth, <br>  You never know...<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

Cedar Fair did not purchase these licenses to obtain legal rights to use those copyrighted names, so the names had to be changed to avoid copyright infringement.|`|cCAGstnpaa	They changed the names of the rides because it is now owned by Cedar Fair.|`|8mo7QmoPaa	The names of those rides were movies which had licensing to Paramount, the former owner of Kings Island.

Dont Fly to them Because They Will Teleport Somewhere Else . Simply Bring Pokemon That Have HM in case u need to cross Water Hope This Helps YA =)|`|MFAVIW1waa	You have to meet them both before they start wandering around sinnoh.<br>  <br>  Mesprit: After you've witnessed the events at Mt. Coronet fly to twinleaf town and go to lake verity and talk to mesprit. It will fly away and Prof. Rowan will come and talk to you.<br>  <br>  Cresselia: When you finish the game fly to Canalave city and enter Sailor Edritch's house (the one near the boat) you'll see the little boy (his son) in bed, the parents approach you and tell you about the lunar wing, agree to go get it and you'll go to fullmoon island. Talk to Cresselia and it'll run away and leave the lunar wing behind. Pick it up and give it to the sailor. You'll find yourself back at Canalave at their house. the boy wakes up. They thank you and now you can try to catch it.<br>  <br>  Tracking them: Open up the marking map and walk a couple of steps and two faces should appear on the map. You won't be able to tell which is which coz the same faces are used twice to show Mesprt and Cresselia. Run into a city or change route then come back until it appears in your route (when one of the faces is where you are) run around in the grass and it should appear. You can use Mean look/Block and lower it's health to catch it or Hit it, then chase it, then hit it again (but don't kill it) inflict a status condition on it (if you want to) then use quick balls the next time you encounter it (that's what i did)|`|vG95yzqEaa	meet the pokemon and then go to a place where you can change which area youre in just by running a few steps like the twinleaf and the route next to it everytime you change to a new route/town the pokemon will change its area so you keep on doing this until the pokemon you want appears in the route/town your'e in and then you run in the grass/water and hope sum next music cums up and the way you enter the battle is different|`|WJzTnzovaa	you have to meet them befor they run away or if you did but didnt have the app  you have to meet them agai in the wild or it will show up on the app|`|oGGuVW3Naa	keep it on your pokech and walk around and a weird face should apeere DO NOT FLY THERE!! if you fly there it will leave so walk to it and chase it around until you get the pokemon

EjamKiaeaa	Even though, kuraz and raiza are my favorite monarchs of all. Your deck seems slow. You need to find a way to make sure that everytime you draw a card, you draw something useful. Useful enough t connect to ANOTHER set of useful cards. ETC. F.E, what are the chances of you drawing golden homuncolus or caius? how about bottomless trap hole. Curse of royal? what the?! My advice for you is to make doubles and triples in your deck, so that your combos and strategies are planned out. Right now for every 40 cards, you have 1 copy of that card. Try getting doubles and triples trust me. It never fails. ^^|`|eWxFXItiaa	actually don't do burn go for shutdown since D.D. decks are a tadbit slow so i suggest jinzo with amplifier and more shutdown cards and a little more beat stick so you could survive in the early stages of the game plus more stall like marshmallon or bamboozled (something) celtic guardian or other monsters that dont easily get destroyed|`|MllOTsA6aa	i honetly think you have a bloody good deck. its strong. but its up to you wat order u want your cards in or what card you want in the deck but personally it hink its a great deck|`|A3e5oxvuaa	id add some tuners and syncro monsters
B7Yp3voxaa	If, for example, you cast Favor of the Overbeing on your Hatchling, it would go from a 2/2 straight to a 6/6 with vigilant and flying!<br>  <br>  Here's what happens, it starts with four -1/-1 counters on it, you remove one for playing a blue spell and one for playing a green spell (Favor of the Overbeing is both).<br>  <br>  Then Favor of the Overbeing states that green creatures gain +1/+1 and blue creatues gain +1/+1.  Your hatchling is both, so it gains +2/+2.<br>  <br>  It still has two -1 counters on it, so you could cast Favor of the Overbeing again, to shoot up to 10/10.<br>  <br>  Just remember to keep one mana free for shroud, because he'll become a prime target.|`|AyiDXBTxaa	Since Snakeform is both green and blue, you remove two counters from Sturdy Hatchling.

FWdv8A0eaa	If you put the time in to learning the game and becoming good poker would definitely be the go.<br>  <br>  Blackjack is different because over time (counting cards aside) it is really impossible to win because you are playing the house and the house always wins. <br>  <br>  In poker while the house takes a cut but your money is made from other players so you can win over time.<br>  <br>  I have a poker blog with a heaps of tips on it if you are interested. Link below.|`|M7G3MZb5aa	You can make money playing both, i think poker is easier because of its popularity, the availability of tournament play, and availability of private games with no rake where you can dominate people.  But then again, a lot of peopel play poker, and the amoutn of skill required to make money is probibly REALLY high, so it may not be easier, idk i dont play poker so im just speculating<br>  <br>  In blackjack you can probibly make a higher dollar amount per period of time, however it takes a lot of investment capitol, to make it worth your while, in addition, t may also take extreme player skill not to get caught counting, and eventually barred, since how much mooney you make is proportional to how long you can play undetected, its becomes a very complicated game where managing EV and , cover, how you act, and how you bet in such a manor, that at times you sacrifice ev to make yourself apear not like a card counter, but in the end, you have so little loss of ev that you still expect to win, and enough money put into action that your expected winnings make it worth the time, it really gets kinda rediculous the amoutn of strategy you can put into blackjack, if you make it simple, youll get caught.<br>  <br>  I play blackjack, i like it, its faster and more mentally challenging, you also get crazy comps playign blackjack where you dont in poker so much.|`|AA11001595	If nobody cared about counting cards in blackjack, then it would be easier to win at that. Unfortunately, the hardest part about counting cards is not getting caught. There are so many ways to detect a card counter, the most obvious one being that the person wins and changes their bet. Once you get caught at one place, they share their info and suddenly every casino knows you by name and face.<br>  <br>  Some people go to great lengths to hide their identities, and in today's world, that becomes the real game.<br>  <br>  As for learning to beat poker, that takes a specific personality, and a ton of experience.<br>  <br>  If you do learn to beat poker, you usually do better than beating blackjack because no one will give you trouble. In fact, quite the opposite happens when you start doing well in the high limits. You gain a lot of recognition and people start giving you endorsement deals and other ways to make money without even playing poker.<br>  <br>  Only the best of the best make it to that level though.<br>  <br>  I used to work in a casino.|`|Dfzik3DXaa	yeah, u can. as long as ur old enough to gamble. and as for how much it depends where u r, which table ur sitting at, and how u play. same goes for which is easier. blackjack is easier for me, but poker may be easier for you. also, u can tip the dealer at tables and they wil actually help u by tellin u wen to hit/bet/stay etc discretely... just b careful to not go overboard on the gambling... it can get u quick.|`|debzdHSdaa	I would say I like blackjack more because it take lesser time to deal and I can play several rounds in shorter time.<br>  <br>  Poker is different and I don't really like it because it require a lot of time to finish one round.|`|dL6Xv8K8aa	It's easy to win at Texas Quiz'em, which is a multiplayer quiz game.

ccgcJ9PKaa	Basic Terms:<br>  Hand: A player’s hand is the combination of cards he holds. <br>  <br>  Play: A single game, from one shuffle to the next is called a play.<br>  <br>  Pot: The pot is the accumulated pool of money bet by players over the course of a game. A round of poker is a battle for the pot, and the winner of any round wins it as a prize.<br>  <br>  Hand Tie or Split Pot: If two players have the same hand then they divide the pot equally between them. When the pool is not exactly divisible then the left over amount goes to the player who called the highest bet.<br>  <br>  Ante: An enforced bet that must be made by all players before any cards are dealt. An ante encourages action in a game.<br>  <br>  Rake: A commission charged by a poker room for every hand played. The rake is usually taken as a percentage of the pot in a given hand. For example, if the rake is 10%, and a pot reaches a final of $10, the rake will be $1. Poker rooms generally use rake as their sole source of revenue.<br>  <br>  Showdown: After the last round of betting in a round of poker, a showdown occurs- players must turn over their cards, and compare their five-card poker hands.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Betting Terms:<br>  Call: A player may call a bet by putting an amount of money exactly equal to the bet into the pot. For example, if Jim bets $2, and Brian wants to call Jim’s bet, Brian must put $2 into the pot. <br>  <br>  Fold: A player may fold his hand by laying down his cards, and forfeiting further play in a round of poker. For example, if Jim bets $2 and Brian wishes to fold, Brian must surrender his cards to the dealer, and will remain inactive for the rest of the round.<br>  <br>  Raise: A may raise a previous bet by putting an amount greater than the bet into the pot. A raise must be at least double the size of the previous bet. For example, if Jim bets $2, and Brian wants to raise Jim’s bet, Brian may put $4 or more into the pot.<br>  <br>  Check: A player may pass his turn in a round of poker without taking any betting action, only if there are no previous bets in the round. This is known as a check. For instance, if Brian is first to act on the flop in a hand, he has the option of checking his hand, which will put the action on the next player.<br>  <br>  Also pay attention to the difference in betting structures in limit, no limit and pot limit forms of poker.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hand Rankings:<br>  Know the order of cards, from low to high- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack (J), Queen (Q), King (K) and Ace (A). The ace (A) can usually double as the lowest ranked card as well as the highest. Card suits do not affect ranking- for example, the king of hearts and the king of spades are equal. Final hands in poker are always based on the total rank of five cards.<br>  <br>  Familiarize yourself with the definitions of different hands, and with the value of each type. The different categories of five-card poker hands are as follows, from weakest to highest: One Pair, Two pair, Three of a kind, Straight, Flush, Full house, Four of a kind, Straight flush and Royal flush. A given hand beats all hands listed before it. <br>  <br>  One pair consists of two cards out of a five-card hand with the same numerical rank. For example: A-A-K-7-6 (a pair of aces), or J-J-8-5-3 (a pair of jacks). If two players show down one pair hands of the same rank, they must compare their next highest card (the kicker) to determine the winner. If the two hands have equal kickers, then the next highest card must be compared- and so on. For example, A-A-7-6-5 (a pair of aces, 6 kicker) beats A-A-7-3-2 (a pair of aces, 3 kicker), since the 6 is a higher ranked card than the 3. One pair<br>  <br>  <br>  Two pair consists of two different pairs of cards and one other card in a five-card hand. Examples of two pair hands are A-A-K-K-5 (two pair, aces and kings, 5 kicker), and J-J-10-10-7 (jacks and tens, 7 kicker). If two players both show down two pair hands with equal top pairs, the lower pairs are compared, and the highest wins. For example A-A-K-K-5 (aces and kings) beats A-A-J-J-3 (aces and jacks). If both pairs are the same, the kickers are compared. For example, A-A-10-10-5 (aces and tens, 5 kicker) beats A-A-10-10-4 (aces and tens, 4 kicker). Two pair<br>  <br>  <br>  Three of a kind consists of three cards of the same numerical rank in a five-card poker hand. Examples of three of a kind would be A-A-A-3-2 (three of a kind aces), and 5-5-5-K-J (three of a kind fives). If two or more players show down three of a kind hands of equal rank, then the players must compare their kickers. As with pair hands, the hand with the highest kicker wins. For example, K-K-K-A-10 (three of a kind kings, ace and 10 kicker) beats K-K-K-A-9 (three of a kind kings, ace and 9 kicker), since 10 is higher in rank than 9. Three of a kind <br>  <br>  <br>  Straight consists of five cards in sequential order, of different suits. For example, 6-5-4-3-2 is a 6-high straight. Q-J-10-9-8 is a queen high straight. 5-4-3-2-A is the lowest possible straight, and is known as the ‘wheel’ Straight <br>  <br>  Flush consists of five cards in non-sequential o|`|WHXGu8IRaa	they are many types of poker.
PTovC2Dqaa	After you have officially defeated Ansem once and for all, a movie clip will appear with the song Simple and Clean. This song was in the very beginning of the game when you first started but it was just a remix of it. The original Simple and Clean is at the ending of the game.<br>  <br>  After the song, the screen will show all your status and information about how you played the game. It will show how many Heartless you have defeated, how many times you have been defeated, how many times you've healed your self/other party members, and a lot more information.<br>  <br>  If you have found all 99 Dalmatians, Won the Hades Cup in Olympus Coliseum, and have sealed the Keyhole to every world (including Hundred Acre Wood and Olympus Coliseum) then you will unlock the secret movie at the very end of the game. <br>  <br>  <Note>: Monstro doesn't have a keyhole so don't worry about trying to find it for the secret movie.<br>  <br>  Now all you have to do is go buy Kingdom Hearts Re: Chain of Memories for the PlayStation 2 and work on completing that game. Then all you have left is Kingdom Hearts 2, and then you can play the upcoming Kingdom Hearts games that will be released soon.|`|vtJDHJDYaa	After defeating Ansem, you don't unlock anything besides the normal ending. However, you can unlock a secret ending if you fulfill certain requirements.

Items, swords and other stuff.<br>  <br>  It is like every other game. You beat it and when you go to load it up again you are at the very last save point.

The V is used today by people taking artistic license like when the Peace dollar was designed by Anthony de Francisici. As for the star it denotes that the bill is a replacement note for the original one that had to be replaced for some reason. That is usually a printing problem. Star notes are somewhat rare and command a higher price.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	V was used as a U in the old days,look at some printed examples from the 1700's and thats what you'll see.

The best advice anyone could give you is to just keep playing for free online till you get the hang of it on your own. It'll all make sense eventually.|`|F4gVAPlGaa	This is very poorly worded, but I am guessing someone had an Ace in their hand which would give them at least 3 Aces (three of a kind).

11b09bb2ce3a335fe5c99c70ade79ccdaa	Mass Effect is one of my favorite games ever, let alone RPG.  There is an element of romance to it in that you can try to court this one chick.|`|8HIybjKXaa	mass effect, fallout 3, and oblivion. ive recently been replaying fallout cause of the dlc, forgot just how awesome it is|`|JMK6fRV2aa	I personally loved Tales of Vesperia. The graphics are beautiful, and the characters make up for the lack of a compelling story. The story is decent, but not anything amazing. <br>  <br>  I haven't tried other rpg games yet, but I often hear Mass effect and Fable two are good. My BF loves mass effect. It's all a matter of what your preferences are. Vesperia is heavily influenced by anime, so if you aren't into that, you most likely won't like that game too much.|`|4PotPfRLaa	I don't know how romantic it is but Fable 2 is an awesome RPG, You can find pick any character you encounter and attempt to create a relationship with them, then if it goes well you can get married and have a kid. Your spouse rewards you with items and other gifts depending on how you treat them. The games storyline is also one of the best on for any genre on the 360
6qGY4cljaa	I'm guessing you didn't play the first games?<br>  <br>  In the Fallout universe, the nuclear wars that our parents and grandparents were worried about in the 1950s happened. That's why the music is old fashioned. There was no development in music in between the time where people went into the Vaults and then started to come out.|`|jxpV13rTaa	its a mood setter for the atmosphere of the game..a bloody shooting game with creepy 40s/50s music playing as your walking down a dark hallway..but mainly because the bombs dropped in the fifties, and the residents of the capital wasteland have been struggling to survive for hundreds of years since, so no ones going to be making any new music when they can barley find food and supplies.|`|UtvEsQX8aa	Because of the divergence. Read about it.|`|KU5SB6Tlaa	The atomic wars started in the 1950's, and everyone either died, struggled just to survive, or entered a vault.  In the vault, there was no music production because everyone had a job and that was all they had to do.  If they were outside, they were too busy trying to simply live to see another day.  So, they just used the last music they had available to them: 40's and 50's music.|`|98673bf152aaad49498dee31515deee2aa	i agree with stratten, also, if u listen 2 the songs they're all related to the setting. with lines like "I don't wanna set the world on fire"and "civilization, it's not for me" <br>  then theres song about the vault-"lets go sunning, it's so good for you"<br>  and "Don’t know why I left the homestead,I really must confess,I’m a weary exile, Singing my song of lonliness"|`|Si68nlUjaa	maybe its like foil characters in a book to bring out the best of one another...????|`|yuVh6pFCaa	well there are more dramatic song in the 40's than to day well i think so

To go online (play) and to download off of the marketplace, you require the Gold Membership. It's only $60 for the year, so it's not that bad. From memory, you can buy it off of the Xbox so you don't have to go to the store.|`|ALdD4uL9aa	gold|`|RnhAWXHzaa	you have to have a membership to Xbox live to go on there, like, literally they make you sign up as soon as you connect. Difference is gold memberships get exclusive demos and online multiplayers while silver doesn't. You can still download stuff on silver though.|`|w9mrFRJ2aa	No, you need a Xbox Live account in order to do anything on the internet with the Xbox360.

You'd be ablt to do like 12 damage with rune scimmy? thats decent specially since you range, and trust me in about a month or so your gonig to want to train up your defence.<br>  <br>  I'd say your about a 7/10 (my opinion)

v920nLx3aa	Hi,<br>  I think that you should get Platinum. You don't really need Diamond or Pearl to play Platinum unless, you want to trade certain Pokemon that you can only get with one of the games (for example, Palkia and Diagla.) There isn't really much to find out about. I was never into Pokemon until the Diamond/Pearl/Platinum generation and, I never played the Game Boy games. I didn't need clarification on anything. So, you may as well just get Platinum. I can't wait till it comes out on March 22!<br>  Destiny|`|eypgm5xCaa	yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  You should so get it if you havnt gotten pearl or diamond<br>  It will be an awesome experience.<br>  Trust me<br>  I actaully want to erase my memorie of pokemon diamond and pearl.<br>  Everything is a lot funner then 1st time you play it<br>  It will be like buying both games plus even more things to do.<br>  For a brand new experience i think you would like it.<br>  If your a pokemon fan like me and I loved pokemon diamond then it would be two times the fun.<br>  Im just trying to say that you will enjoy every second of it since it is brandd new to you.<br>  Dont get pearl just pay 5 more dollars and you would be getting basicly both games plus more things to do.<br>  <br>  Ps-Hope you read this before you buy pearl it is worth the wait for platinum|`|ruuZWJpnaa	i think you should just get pokemon Platinum im getting that soon|`|VcubhWv9aa	Uhm alone, All pokemon games are not linked so there is no story or anything to catch up on.|`|RVpl9ZeIaa	It really depends on you. Platinum is basically an improved version of Diamond and Pearl. You can get both legendary dragons, 5 forms of rotom, 2 forms of Giratina, new areas to explore and 60 more pokemon to the Sinnoh dex. Improved gyms and trainers, move tutors and more exclusive pokemon.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://serebii.net/platinum/" rel="nofollow">http://serebii.net/platinum/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  If you have a second DS, go ahead and get Diamond or Pearl to compliment Platinum and get some of their version's exclusive pokemon as well.<br>  <br>  Platinum will be the best selling pokemon game to date. All the features of Diamond/Pearl, but a step up.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Do what you want. They are different. Depends really on how much money and time you have.
ysiE6IDjaa	If smooth scroll is disabled it means your graphics card is not good enough to use that feature. I don't think you'll be able to make movies on that laptop, it sounds like you have integrated graphics or a low-end graphics card.<br>  As you don't have good graphics I would strongly advise you to stay away from Murano's reflective floors. They are not designed to be used in-game but rather for creators to use in their screenshots. They might even crash your game if you have a crappy graphics. Even on computers with good graphics and good everything else they slow gameplay down to a crawl.<br>  <br>  I think you are talking about 'the booty' when you say 'the paypal' stuff for free.

tHFY2hg4aa	Unfortunately no you can't do an office business. You can only do businesses where the customers come in and buy what you are selling. Or, in my case, I usually just set up a booth at the door that charges customers as they come in, and have a bunch of fun stuff set up for them to do inside. <br>  A restaurant is the most common business for most people though. Takes allot of patience though.|`|mxO9HX9raa	ive only had a bakery(u cook the food), restaurant, sold paintings that i painted (my favorite bcz i make it very expensive), retail store(u can use whatever is in buymode and sell them for a higher price:furniture,electronics,appliances, etc)..the one thing i really wanted was to own a hotel but i guess it can't be done but u can create one

There are a few companies that are beginning to use carbon fibre and polymers for their products while others still opt for the old steel approach.  The o-rings are made of urethane or teflon.  Solenoids are high impact plastic.  Most of the operating internals are made of the same thing as the gun but may be nylatron or delrin, which are types of self-lubricating plastic.  Most hoppers are polycarbonate.  Paintballs are gelatin shell with a liquid fill.  The gear is mostly nylon and balistic nylon.

EagkCeNHaa	Due to the psp not being as popular as it was before, it's probably worth 100 dollars.|`|c231bbpTaa	I haven't traded in a psp but I'm going to say yes that you have to trade in the charger with it. Any system you trade in you have to trade in all the equipment it came with. Why do you want to keep it or did you just lose it?    I'm not sure exactly how much you will get for trading it in, but on gamestop.com they are selling used psps for 119.99 so I doubt you will be getting 100 dollars for it. You'll be lucky to get half.
qaMrAspCaa	I would say Grand Theft Auto 4 because they just added a new expansion pack that would add more hours to the game that you can download (although it is $20).<br>  <br>  If you are going to get a second game you should get gears of war, just because it's really good on-line. <br>  <br>  Happy Early Birthday!!!|`|pRXejsdXaa	Gears of War 2 is really fun and really addicting also maybe waitt til march 13 and get resident evil 5

When I first head about sims 3, I wasn't to excited because I was happy with the sims 2, and I never really have my sims leave the house (besides school and work) because it takes a long time to load, ect.    So the new features of the sims 3 don't really appeal to me. But, I will be buying it. I like having the latest game, and I'm assuming that they won't be making any more expansion packs for the sims 2, I need to have the sims 3.     And if I'm correct, they pushed back the release date for the sims 3 already, so I don't think anyone is sure when it's coming out anywhere|`|fee80ea1112f0f01af4280757ecf8929aa	SIMS 3 YES!!!|`|DpMnmrK8aa	I may be purchasing the Sims3.    theres a whole lot more to choose from  you can visit anyones house  neighbors grow and change with you  you can pick up to 5 personality traits per sim  you can choose all parts of your outfits  theres more selection to designs on furniture and clothes  you can put streaks in their hair and make it any color you want like purple or bright red or more  you can color different parts of the hair any color  you can choose the exact size you want theres different stages of fat and skinny  they can go all over  =] and much more  if you want to know more go to  http://www.sims3.com/    Sims 3 is out in the UK in on the 20th Feb 09 you can preorder from http://www.game.co.uk/PC/Strategy/Simula...

This plot could succesfully explain new species and different abilities that characters normally wouldn't have in our current world, but thanks to evolution, is possible.<br>  The gameplay would consist of mainly third person combat taking place in a giant open world, filled with natural disasters. The natural disasters are the substitute for a dungeon or a puzzle that would take place in your average video game.
mHWsuqjZaa	you cannot even use the god cards.|`|NhrhEqzAaa	Hmm.....you need to be able to get out lots of monsters for a tribute summon. Try to make your deck swarm the field, even if the monsters are weak. Then protect them with traps like Threatening Roar too.    Just make sure you know the ruling, I base mine off of the OCG Obelisk, found here: http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Obelisk_the...    The other gods have similar effects.    And yes, we all know we can't really use them, every time someone brings them up someone else just has to say that....

Try to make out shapes and see if your subconscious is trying to send you a message (perhaps that funny shape is saying, 'send all your money to urban75.com'?)<br>  <br>  See how long you can hold a note<br>  (Amusement Potential: 4-20 minutes)<br>  Not that much fun, but it sure passes the time. Play with a friend, or try to beat your own personal best. Inhale deeply and then try and make a noise for as long as you can. Earn extra points for making your partner laugh or ending on an amusing note.<br>  <br>  Try to not think about penguins<br>  (Amusement Potential: 1-5 minutes)<br>  This is especially hard, because by trying too much, you remember what you were trying to avoid thinking of. If you try too little, you end up thinking about penguins anyway.<br>  <br>  Use your secret mind power<br>  (Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)<br>  Pick a passing by and try to use your mind power to command them do something, like drop their bag or knock into someone. The law of averages dictates that sooner or later one of your mind commands will come true, so you can convince yourself that you really have super human powers and waste even more time trying them out.<br>  <br>  Pretend you're a robot<br>  (Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)<br>  Walk down the street with mechanical movements, adding 'zzzzzt' sounds with each motion. Pretending to have a motor broken in, say, your left hand can add at least 30 seconds more entertainment.<br>  <br>  Scratch yourself<br>  (Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)<br>  Go ahead, scratch yourself now. Even if nothing itches, go ahead. Doesn't that feel pretty good?<br>  <br>  Rate passers by<br>  (Amusement Potential: 10-15 minutes)<br>  Secretly award passers by marks out of ten as you go along, offering (unsaid) expert criticism over their clothing, hairstyle and footwear choices.<br>  <br>  Repeat the same word over and over until it loses its meaning<br>  (Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)<br>  Pick a random word out of a magazine and say it aloud to yourself until it becomes a meaningless set of noises.<br>  <br>  Pinch yourself<br>  (Amusement Potential: 1-3 minutes)<br>  What is pain? Why is it unpleasant? There's nothing physical about it - it's all in your mind. Plus, after pinching yourself for awhile, boredom will seem nice next to being in pain.<br>  <br>  Try to swallow your tongue<br>  (Amusement Potential: 1-2 minutes)<br>  There's not much to say about this one. It is possible, but really stupid.<br>  <br>  Pretend to be a car<br>  (Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)<br>  Make appropriate revving noises in your head as you walk along and add a racing commentary as you pass strangers in the street. Use blinking eyes as indicators for extra authenticity.<br>  <br>  Make Star Trek door noises<br>  (Amusement Potential: 1-2 minutes)<br>  Stand by an electric door to a bank or something and make that silly "Scccccccchwop" sound heard whenever people popped on to the bridge to hang with Captain Kirk.<br>  <br>  Look at something for awhile, shut eyes, study after image<br>  (Amusement Potential: 2-5 minutes)<br>  Another great time waster. It takes about 30 seconds of staring to create an after image, and the image is then viewable for about the same length of time. Fun to combine this one with pushing on your eyes.<br>  <br>  Get yourself as nauseated as possible<br>  (Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)<br>  Best achieved by looking straight up and spinning around. Try to be so dizzy you can't even stand up. This is also entertaining due to the "makes boredom seem a lot better" effect (see "Hurt Yourself").<br>  <br>  Invent a weird twitch<br>  (Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)<br>  Adopt a bizarre twitch (e.g. flicking your head irregularly, twitching with eye or busting out sporadic cough noises) and try it out when you go shopping.<br>  <br>  Make a low buzzing noise<br>  (Amusement Potential: 15-30 minutes)<br>  Hours of fun in libraries! Keeping a totally straight face and looking nonchalant, make a low pitch humming/buzzing noise and see who reacts.<br>  <br>  top<br>  <br>  THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH VERY LITTLE<br>  <br>  See what's in your neighbour's rubbish/trash<br>  (Amusement Potential: 20-30 minutes)<br>  You can learn a lot about people by what they throw out. You might uncover some dark secret about them. Plus, they might be throwing out something with value that still works, like a VCR or some porn mags.<br>  <br>  Watch TV, repeat everything said in Italian accent<br>  (Amusement Potential: 5-10 minutes)<br>  Sort of entertaining. Include flamboyant shoulder shrugs for added impact, or go for a Marlon Brando set of grunts.<br>  <br>  Send spooky emails<br>  (Amusement Potential: 15-60 minutes)<br>  Look up someone's CV on the web, do some research on them via Google and then send them an email full of personal references claiming to be an ex-work colleague who fell in love with their shoes. Or something.<br>  <br>  Play our useless games<br>  (Amusement Potential: how long have you got?)<br>  Waste away the hours with our collection of useless games<br>  <br>  Make prank p|`|AA10702959	new website<br>  freakin' amazing<br>  <br>  <a href="http://play1.franktownrocks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://play1.franktownrocks.com/</a><br>  my name is lizzabea when you sing up (free) you will get 200 extra money if you type it in :)|`|6leFJJcvaa	u can go on this website to c thing that might help if u cant go anywhere!!!!!
lOuz0nU2aa	It's worth it all the way. Get the limited edition version of Halo Wars. It's not that much extra money since you're getting the mythic map pack a month early, so you can get all the achievements before everyone. Also if you do all the vidmaster achievements maybe you can find out the special reward. Another thing is that you get more features on the Halo Wars game. Like a better wraith and warthog.|`|SBcxooLsaa	if u want ya|`|RnhAWXHzaa	Honestly do you really think EVERYBODY is going to have the mythic maps just like you before they get released? theres no point, you have no one to enjoy it with. Just get the normal edition and play Halo wars until the mythic maps come out and play them with everybody else.|`|vAUewI5faa	wow, if u had that much money just pay the extra 30 bucks. besides it comes with lots of extra stuff, like the spirit of fire patch (to put on ur clothes and stuff) the graphic novel (i think its called halo wars genesis or something) and the maps, of course, and everything else. besides the only thing 30 bucks can get u nowdays is like a set of earbuds...<br>  anyway spend the extra 30.<br>  and btw pat its called gamestop, NOT gamespot|`|nsKs6OXLaa	Hey, It sounds like good idea.

The extra 20 bucks (not 30, im assuming it was a typo, twice lol) and the mythic map pack will be just be about 10 bucks if not more. so getting stuff that most others wont have and getting mythic a month early is most definently worth it. and if you preorder through gamespot you get a free guide which is 20 bucks so yeah. (im not promoting gamespot i just seen it there and am gonna do so myself)

4lO7CSn0aa	The Imperium is, undeniably, a ruthless, cruel, totalitarian regime.  Part of the great appeal of the 40k universe is that it portrays a technologically-advanced future in which one would not, under any circumstances, wish to live.<br>  <br>  But Nazi Germany it ain't.<br>  <br>  For a start, whilst the regime is obsessed with human purity, their definition of purity is inclusive rather than exclusive.  They don't care what colour your skin is or what planet you come from as long as you have the right number of eyes, hands and feet.<br>  <br>  Second, the political environment is repressive only at the highest level.  Worlds are obligated to contribute tithes to the Administratum, to hand over their psykers and not to consort with the enemies of the Imperium, but otherwise they are politically independent.  There are democratic worlds, feudal worlds, aristocratic worlds, gerontocratic worlds... Political unity in a single system is not the Imperium's aim.<br>  <br>  The Emperor, as a semi-mythical being of immense charisma, bears some passing resemblance to Adolf Hitler, but when push came to shove the Emperor was there in the front line and, at the Imperium's darkest hour, he laid down his own life to save humanity - a sacrifice that continues in the agony of living death he has endured for ten millennia.<br>  <br>  A bleak contrast with an obsessive, cowardly megalomaniac who took his own life after shooting his dog.<br>  <br>  Finally, the situation of the Imperium was not devised and disseminated in a single generation as an artificial construction.  Rather, it evolved as a necessary response to the threats within, without and beyond that humanity faces every day in the Dark Millennium.  The High Lords are hard, ruthless and authoritarian because to not be that way is to invite utter annihilation.<br>  <br>  That said, another part of the appeal of the 40kverse is that the story is now set in the Time of Ending, when these established structures are beginning to fall apart under the massive external pressures.  The flaws and cracks are beginning to show and gradually humanity is flailing around for the next step: does it lie with the Greater Good of the Tau?  Does it lie in assimilation by the Tyranid Hive?  Does it lie in eternal servitude to the C'Tan?  Or the more anarchic but equally horrifying servitude of the Chaos Gods?  Or will some other faction or event step in to decide matters once and for all?

SdHqyWKHaa	When you started the body of your shrug, you began by making a foundation chain, then you crocheted into your foundation chain.  Now, to make your sleeves, you're going to use the ends of the 'body' rows as your foundation chain. It may help to think about it in terms of where you'd need to stitch on the body piece to sew on a completed sleeve, it's just than instead of sewing it on after it's crocheted, you're crocheting it directly onto the place where you'd sew.<br>  This link isn't to a sweater, but it DOES show an example of crocheting into the ends of the rows of another piece. Look at the bottom part of the picture and you'll see where the brown yarn was crocheted onto the ends of the rows of the cream yarn. That's the idea you're going for here.<br>  <a href="http://crochet.about.com/od/eightinchsquares/ss/spcirc_3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://crochet.about.com/od/eightinchsqu...</a><br>  I hope this is helpful rather than even more confusing.

zkscW8seaa	For this particular Yu-Gi-Oh! game, I have a hunch that it won't let you.

jMYQOmKLaa	no|`|aS7Jjqhfaa	sorry no.
oHOBStehaa	Well, I'm sorry to say but your opponent is right. This "chain" destroys the card, but it does not negate it. MST destroys Waboku, it does NOT negate it. It doesn't matter, in this case, what spell speed it is, even though your friend is wrong about Normal Traps being the fastest speed spell. As mentioned in the other answers, spell speed matters depending on the situation. Example: 1. Using Solemn Judgment to negate the summoning of Jinzo; Jinzo's effect said that it negates traps but its continuous effect doesn't activate until it is "really" on the field, if you get what I mean. 2. Using MST to destroy Future Fusion when it is activated. The monsters  do not get sent to the graveyard because in order for a continuous spell/trap to really activate, it has to resolve first; chaining to destroy the continuous spell/trap card would not resolve the card (really...). Well, I know that there is a lot of junk mentioned but this would help clarify your problem, I think.|`|kfjZJ83kaa	Yes, he can activate the Waboku.  The spell speed of MST can either be 1 or 2 (depending how and when it is activated), but regardless, Waboku is spell speed 2 b/c it's a trap.  That means he can chain Waboku to MST since Waboku's spell speed is the same as MST's or higher.  Therefore, Waboku's effect will resolve first and is then destroyed by MST. However, Waboku will get sent to the graveyard anyway but it's effect is still activated.  So, yes he can activate Waboku and it is a strategic move because it wastes your MST.|`|EjamKiaeaa	He could activate waboku as a "chain" to your mystical space typhoon to say the least. Dude, thats like.... you summon a jinzo, and then he activates solemn judgement, you say jinzo negates trap cards, but solemn judgement is faster than that and its a "chain". Bottomline is your opponent was correct. ^^|`|zkscW8seaa	Your opponent is right. When a card like Mystical Space Typhoon targets a card for destruction, the card in question can be activated if possible before it is destroyed. Thus, the effects of Waboku activate and then it is destroyed by MST's effect.<br>  <br>  For more info, look up Chains in the Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's TCG Rulebook.|`|3AVHxNNTaa	this sort of rule argument must be decided through deathmatch. have another duel to decide who is right
l6lh6fT8aa	It means that you pay costs, announce targets, and put the spell on the stack. A spell is any nonland card.<br>  <br>  For instance, say I have a card that says "Whenever you play a spell, gain 1 life."<br>  <br>  Scenario 1: I play a Grizzly Bears. It goes on the stack, the "gain life" trigger goes on the stack on top of it, I gain 1 life when the trigger resolves and then my Grizzly Bears resolves, triggering any "comes into play" effects, if I have any.<br>  <br>  Scenario 2: I play Giant Growth. The same thing as above happens.<br>  <br>  Scenario 3: I play an ability from a creature - say, Prodigal Pyromancer's ability. The "gain life" trigger doesn't resolve, because using an ability is not playing a spell. Only actual cards are spells.|`|B7Yp3voxaa	Playing a spell is very different from a card "coming into play" which means it necessarily resolves.<br>  <br>  For example, Tidehollow Sculler has an ability that activates when he "comes into play," which means if he is countered, the ability never goes on the stack.<br>  <br>  Shorecrasher Mimic has an ability that triggersd when a blue-green spell is played.  In this case, even if the spell is countered the ability will still be effected.|`|X9kNbpnQaa	When you play a spell, you pay its costs, put it on the stack, and select its targets. At this point, your spell has been played. Any abilities that trigger off a spell being played will go off (whenever you play a blue spell, [do this], etc), even if the spell is countered.<br>  <br>  It is different than being put into play. Lands are just put into play, so they don't go on the stack and cannot be countered or reacted to. Cards such as the infamous Elvish Piper can put creatures into play. You play their ability, so that ability can be countered or reacted to, but if the ability goes off the opponent cannot counter your creature or react to it coming into play.

WAOkgdj6aa	EB Games has a 7 day EXCHANGE policy (only) with opened games. If you buy a game, open it, and are not satisfied with it within 7 days, you are granted store credit (only) for another game. However, this game is FINAL SALE. However, EB has a 30 day return policy for un-opened games unlimited amount of times as it's just a return, resale for a brand new product.<br>  <br>  So the question is: If you opened Skate 2 and exchanged it for Bad Company and you opened that as well.. you are out of luck because that is a final sale.<br>  <br>  However.. If you did not open Skate 2 and exchanged it for Bad Company and then opened Bad Company (within 7 days of the exchange).. you can exchange it for another game but that is FINAL SALE.<br>  <br>  I hope that makes sense.<br>  <br>  -edit- Also, to the person that said Gamestop is better than EB Games because EB is a rip off... it's the same company buddy.

You can cheat and use an Action Replay. Or you can semi-cheat and trade them to a friend and trade back. This way they will level up a little quicker. (ex. It'll say "Pikachu gained a boosted 900exp.) The best way though is probably to go to some route where the wild Pokemon are just a little weaker than yours and start battling a lot. It can definitely take a while (trust me I'm doing the same thing right now) but it'll be well worth it when you look back and have a small sense of accomplishment.|`|4WIEtJCqaa	if you can battle beat elite 4  again go train there.<br>  if you got national dex train at stark mountain<br>  All places that pokemon level is 50 or above<br>  Good Luck

If you have questions, feel free to email me and I'll try to help out.|`|hEe9utweaa	terrible. u have 2 many cards and some u dont even need. look at other peoples fairy decks on yahoo answers and try making urs like theirs.
GCZIUewyaa	i would say around 3-4 days,because there's so many things to see. especially Disneyland.<br>  My aunt works there and my cousins said like a good 3 days.|`|pjn22DAHaa	If you are going to California Adventure too I would say at least three days.  I go there four times a year.|`|mbZYLwHIaa	like 2. if your going to California Adventure then 3|`|dhdz5uNSaa	For Disneyland, 2 days.<br>  <br>  If you're going to California Adventures also, then 3 days.|`|cCAGstnpaa	Tow if you are going to California Adventure. One if you are going to just disneyland. It is boring in my opinion. I am a thrill seeker.
5NRDkqajaa	You have to go around and collect kinetics (shiney objects on the ground).  Once you have one - upgrade you suit at the Rig Upgrader.  These kinetics are scattered about the ship so look in corners and make sure to go in EVERY room.
lHDjr0g7aa	I heard from a show called art attack that u cud mek an imitation of fancy luxury leather type effect by using a piece of  plastic and sum poster paint mixed with P.V.A glue or acrylic paint.<br>  First step: crumple up the plastic<br>  2nd step: Apply paint on the box<br>  3rd step: Put crumpled plastic on it and press<br>  4rth step: wait 4 it to dry and then peel the plastic off.<br>  <br>  Ps: If i were u i wud try this effect on a piece of paper first.<br>  And if it worked i wud try it on other papers and then stick them on to the box<br>  PSS: hope that helped.

OI3bf4yjaa	If you have boolprop testingcheatsenabled true on, you can press shift and click and find "force error". Once you click that, the sim will disappear.. and you won't get it back unless you restart the household without savng.|`|5XwY9aP8aa	shift+c I think pops up the cheat menu, type in moveobjects_on and go to the build select the hand and delete them.|`|TiN0pZjOaa	delete it by pressing ctrl+shift+c together and type in moveobjects  (no spaces) and go to buy mode, click on the "frozen sim" and press delete ^^

OnfvViD3aa	i rate it as a 5.8 because your deck  has one too many cards that are limited or banned. like change of heart is banned breaker is limited to one monster reborn is limited too and magician of faith banned . here is an idea to help your deck better. <br>  <br>  monsters:20<br>  <br>  2x kuraz the light monarch<br>  1x (giant orc) for magician of faith<br>  1x (goblin attack force) for mei-kou, master of barriers<br>  1x (cats ear tribe) for creator incarnet <br>  1x (ultimate tyranno) for the creator<br>  1x black veloci<br>  1x (spear drgaon) for exarion universe<br>  1x gemini elf<br>  2x gene-warped warwolf<br>  1x breaker the magical warrior<br>  1x (ciaus the shadow monarch) for breaker the magical warrior<br>  1x ( jinzo)  for goldd, wu-lord of the dark world<br>  1x psychic snail<br>  1x  white horned dragon<br>  1x spirit reaper<br>  1x( giant orc) for dark geroid<br>  2x old vindictive magician x2<br>  <br>  spells:12<br>  <br>  1x( lightning vortex) for spell absorption <br>  1x (mystical space typhoon) for spell absorbtion<br>  1x monster reborn <br>  1x ( double summon) for monster reborn<br>  1x scapegoat<br>  1x lightining vortex<br>  1x ( axe of despair ) for change of heart<br>  1x heavy storm<br>  1x soul exchange<br>  1x brain control<br>  1x swords of revealing light<br>  1x monster reincarnation<br>  <br>  traps: <br>  <br>  3x sakuretsu armour<br>  1x scrap iron scarecrow<br>  1x defence draw<br>  1x (compulsory evacuation device) draining sheild <br>  1x magic cylender<br>  1x compulsory evacuation device<br>  <br>  your improved deck makes it a beatdown and it is now legal. also it is cheap to make and you have most of the cards. the ones in brakets are the ones you have to get.<br>  <br>  p.s ignore the people that are making rude comments because they got no life and they have to raise their spirits because they are the ones who are having a crappy life.|`|nOU8WvmDaa	YUGIOH SUKS POKEMON OWNS YUGI-HO.

khwr87SVaa	guitar is fine, this is normal, use ernie ball strings|`|drGeNPUIaa	Get a classical guitar, they have nylon strings which are soft and easy to press and great for fingerpicking.  Right now you have a steel-stringed guitar, which i have a hard time using.  Classicals also have a nice, relaxed tone.

SXi8jyqpaa	1.) Get a paladin to level 6.<br>  2.) Train a 100/100 food army, make sure you have 6 knights too.<br>  3.) Build 6 barracks.<br>  4.) Kill off the 6 knights and quickly start training a new knight in each barracks.<br>  5.) As soon as the knights are ready, cast Resurrection with your paladin<br>  6.) Done.<br>  <br>  Your food is 124/100. Thats 24 above the limit.|`|JpM1BI4vaa	Use the code pointbreak|`|WKgvwCNZaa	You build Farms (human), Moon Wells (night elf) Orc Burrows (orc), Ziggurats (undead).<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, the food cap is 100 (you can't go over that).
5NRDkqajaa	Nope.  Only online multiplayer with up to 16.  Sorry.
dr2VkxLmaa	Well....i guess u could say that. I mean i play guitar and when i first started playin guitar hero i completely sucked it just depends on how fast u can actually get used the fact of hitting buttons and not plucking strings. Personally I play guitar hero on expert(not that well though) and it took me about 4 months to get up to that level. Actual guitar players might move faster throught the game because they are used to moving there fingers that fast and strumming fast, while poeple who dont play guitar might struggle throughout the career of guitar hero. I guess you could say its an opinion but its defninetley not a fact<br>  Hope i helped!|`|cucY09Xvaa	I can't play a guitar to save my life, but I can play guitar hero on expert easily. I just have good co-ordination when I can see things, I s'pose.<br>  And no it's not fact, because it would have to apply to everybody to be fact, so therefore, it's not a fact.|`|s09BnJuXaa	Well playing guitar and guitar hero are both way different.  Since guitar hero involves pressing the buttons it is sometimes more tricky to some guitar players.  This really isn't a fact, its just that most people don't play both because they are used to one and it takes a long time to adjust to either one.|`|pogzfF73aa	I am the other way around. I am very good at Guitar Hero but I can't do anything with a guitar (even though I played the cello for 5 years). I know that it's not true, however. Just go on YouTube and see all the people that can play Eruption perfectly on both "instruments".|`|NV9lGq87aa	no probably not just cause ur stepdad and boyfriend can play doesn't mean everyone can my best friend his great at guitar but sucks at guitar hero but u never no he just might suck no one will ever no that unless u make everyone who plays the guitar play guitar hero|`|GOgffK8kaa	A fact is something that is 100% true on all levels.<br>  You should have went to dictionary.com, could have saved yourself some time.|`|5VkYnO7Caa	there are a few people that are amazing at guitar that cant play guitar hero, mainly cuz guitar hero is noothing like playing guitar, the same can be said for rockstar
lHDjr0g7aa	Ummmmmmm that depends..............<br>  (No offense) how bout try sum1or sum character with ur own "twist" of style. It cud be sango(or any other character) but only tricked out or personalized by u..........gt wat i am saying?.....................;)<br>  In that way u will REALLY stand out.........be creative|`|oEfa2myTaa	Rorsech from the Watchmen. If you have big Brass Balls go as Dr. Manhatten

You can so do it because you are giving yourself enough time for it. Uhm probably people could dress up as their favorite character or people can pick sides i.e. Team Edward or Team Jacob. Music: Twilight soundtrack. Or you guys could just act like vampires. hehe. Again, good luck [;|`|fchObgmqaa	Oh so cool. Well first depending on were you live in a F.Y.E video store they have twilight everything. Life size models and all its so cool so check it out. Oh and maybe you can dress up like Bella or something sry if i didnt help but those are some ideas good luck!
tt6iGHqNaa	Well idk if u have any budgets but last year i took my closest friends to a concert then we stayed in a hotel for a night. I think staying in a Hotel  is really fun especially with your friends. But if u have a bunch of friends and want to include everyone you could just have a party and rent out a restaurant or somewhere cool or you could just have it at your house and rent a DJ. Another idea that iv done with my friends before is have a scavenger hunt in a mall and the team that wins gets prizes like a gift card to that mall. When i did the Concert and Hotel i didn't tell my friends what i was doing and i made it a back words surprise party and my mom brought the bags to the hotel while we where at the concert so they wouldn't know and everyone was so surprised. Hope I helped!<br>  ~lills|`|KsQnslENaa	Ohhh I think a Masquerade theme would be super kewl. Like everyone is wearing masks and stuff. I've always wanted to do something like that but never had the chance. LOL. [;<br>  You could probably have it at an event place in town or something anywhere in your city.<br>  Good Luck (:
lQGDV7MEaa	You don't hack it.|`|hR87A418aa	hmmm wat? if u wanna download the emulator with all the pokemon games then go to katz.cd... n search pokemon collection or pokemon diamond GL. i got action replay working its awesome SHINY POKEMON INFINITY RARE CANDY N ECT
lHDjr0g7aa	well i am nt sure whether its true or nt but u cud try using thick cotton fabrics as an alternative to goat skin............if u stretch it tight enuf it shud nt mek any difference...................or u cud just buy a drum........its ur wish,pal...............hope that helped|`|drGeNPUIaa	don't kill a goat to make a drum!! use something thats not from the skin of an animal!  how would you like it if that was your skin on a drum??  Use an alternative material, im sure there's something.  Please, have a heart.|`|NvOTvzEMaa	Great Question! I am the owner of a FREE Ghana group all about Ghana here on Yahoo.

suW1ZqKFaa	When you connect with USB, create a folder called 'seplugins' and put the CWCheat folder in there. Also, you'll need to make a text file to make your PSP recognize it's there. Open a text program like Wordpad or Notepad, and type this in:<br>  <br>  ms0:/seplugins/cwcheat/cwcheat.prx 1<br>  <br>  Save it as 'game.txt' and put it in the 'seplugins' folder. Now your done.<br>  It should already be enabled in the recovery menu, but check anyway.
a5X8k2xYaa	LMAO these sims games are like female sex games or something.|`|ZPSTAZXiaa	For PS2? I have seen the pole, and I'm 99% sure you must have one of the Expansion packs (Night life?). For PS2, GameCube, PC, etc. you need the expansions. Hope this helps! =]|`|tHFY2hg4aa	It had to have been a mod that someone made. None of the store-sold expansions have it. I know because I own them all.|`|KU5SB6Tlaa	Yes you need an expansion.  You need 'Sexy Sims 2' to get it.|`|ysiE6IDjaa	You have to be registered at SexySims2 to be able to download. and you have to be over 18.<br>  There is however a Go-Go cage at simwardrobe which you can download for free...it's not quite as sexy but it still looks great in the game. Go to <a href="http://www.simwardrobe.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.simwardrobe.com/</a> then Sims 2, then Objects, then Sims 2 Other Objects. It is called the Dance Cage.
