20070702065158AAPtGxF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	To dump or not to dump......?	My bf told me he has a small crush on another girl, but likes me far more-so why can't he get over her? It's hurting me to know he might leave me for some other girl. I told him we should take a break, but he wants to stay together. He only "loves" me because I understand and care, but this new girl has a lot of stuff in common with him. So what happens if she understands and cares? I don't want to get hurt anymore. I still care about him, but I don't know if I can be with a guy who thinks about another girl. He almost kissed her too, but just barely stopped himself. Should I dump him and finally break it off? Or should I stay with him in hope he'll forget about her?

All this is very strange to me. Recently I said Hello to a new friend of mine(woman) and ,in exchange;she gave me 2 kisses with a nice smile.She is from an ex-communist country in Europe.      In some countries,muslim countries,kisses between men is totally normal;but kisses to a married woman is totally forbidden from a woman or a man.      What do you think about all that?? thank you.

20070713230819AAraH5H	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How comfortable are you with your significant other? Am I too comfy? Lol?	I've been with my hotness for over a year and a half, and man do I  ever feel comfortable with her. I think a little maybe too comfortable, you be the judge. I'm going to give you some scenarios from our relationship. Alright we are both 20 and own our own house. (1) I fart in front of her and occasionally on her and she returns the favor if not worse and more often, nothing worse than playing 360 and having a tight little toot ripped on your shoulder..(2) I was showering once after a hard run and I got a NASTY nose bleed out of nowhere, so I proceeded to let the blood drip onto my penis, then called my girlfriend and said "Come quick you have to see this!" she comes and is like OMG. I said, "Look hun I had my first period" She cried laughing. (3) Sometimes I have weird looking feces you know misshapen and oddly colored I like to call her to inspect them, lol  she never learns. (4) I shave her hard to reach areas, it's fun but nerve racking one slip and I won't be doing any slipping.

Everytime me and my man are together ( we live together too) he always brings up one of his ex's no matter what we are talking about or what we are doing....he always feels the need to bring up something they said or did or relate it to one of them. I like never talk about my ex's with him, because i just don't think it's necessary to bring them up when we are together and out of respect for him. Why does he do this and what can i say to get him to stop doing it so often? It really doesn't make me jealous, just is irritating. No nasty answers please...

20070816104850AAIkfoT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me?	So there's this girl that I like. I invited her to go to the movies on saturday, and we're probably going. I want to ask her out but Idk if she likes me. She is sending me mixed signals. My friend asked her out a few months ago and she said no because he was too pushy. She kind of teases him ( not to be mean) and shows me ( and only me) pictures of her ignoring him while he is talking to her on the phone. She still hangs around him alot though and I'm not sure if she likes him or me. Also, a few months ago when we were at the movies, I kinda scooted in close to her and she didn't mind and most recently at my birthday party she was the one of the only people to give me a birthday present. Are these signs that she likes me or am i just making up escuses for her to like me?  Should I wait to ask her out? If I do ask her out saturday, how and where should I ask her out? thanks for your help. oh, and serious answers please.

I am the youngest of 4-also the only half-sibling-which I never felt the difference when my mom was alive.  We buried her on xmas eve last yr, & then they turned on me & i left my mom's house in tears-my oldest brother an alcholic, never even showed up, my other brother robert just showed his a$$ like he always does, which why I don't know since he's a f-ing child molester(his own daughter even) so I don't speak to him for obvious reasons..but the one that hurts the most is my sister Lynnette..i always felt that we were soo close til she got married.  Then she started treating me like $h1t because he told me he married the wrong sister...He's an alcoholic, a cheat, abusive, liar, everything bad you can name & hate in a man..even my mom told her to keep him away from her. Just because he's the biggest loser this century& keeps knocking her up, (she's 45 with 3 kids ages 7,4,1) I'm supposed to be ok with losing her as my family.  I feel so alone at times&wonder if she ever feels the same

20071102031219AATZU7k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Sex for some females is just a routine drill to be gotten over ?	Nowerdays in some MMS females show no great emotion or anxiety, nor they seem to be enjoying sex.  Even the boys as if  they are experimenting with their drilling rigs looking for water gushing, they perform the act and even film it for public, shocking no condoms too being used.  The female just cautions dont spurt inside, do it outside. It was shocking to see the MMS titled Innocent girl.  Well with cell videos lot of MMS are bound to be shot.  It is a real shame to shoot and enjoy such videos, also females while chatting are ready for fun on payments, another shocker for sex to be treated for earning fast buck.  For fun I offered her 500 she was demanding she said not less than 5000 I look like college student, where are morales, are we heading towards western culture. Morale, I don't enjoy paid sex, it should have some element of liking otherwise it is pure prostitution.

20090121041233AAsnhD9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How did cupids arrow strike you.. how did you meet your soulmate, spouse, life partner?	Isn't it amazing how some people meet under the strangest circumstances and then they find that cupids arrow has stuck home.? How did you meet your spouse or your life partner?      A pal on the internet told me how he met his wife.. they had their 25th wedding anniversary last year. he was 47 when they celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary..       He took the same route on his bicycle daily .. in a little English town.. outside of London.. and he was a young man aged 21.. he saw this 10 year old girl every day.. she soon found out he came this way every day and she stopped him in the street.. for ''toll passage'' and other little childlike ideas'' and he played along.. they became quite pally.. and he got to know the girl well.. one day he saw a woman in the garden.. and the girl said '' This is my mom'' .. he and the mom talked.. and he stopped by every evening after work and was invited for a ''cuppa'' a cup of tea and some biscuits.. he liked the lady who was 9 years older than him and had 3 kids and was divorced..  He married her within a year and adopted the children and they had 2 more of their own...that's how Tony my email pal met his wife Shirley.. they are grandparents now. he has been a granddad for the first time when he was just over 40... ''      Someone else I know was queueing up in a fast food restaurant and in front of him was this lady.. they got to talking.. and 2 years later they were married.. '' He too married a woman who was divorced and had 3 children..'' He also adopted them.. but he was 34 when he got married and his bride was 36''      One other pal of mine who was in the navy from age 16 to age 40.. never managed to stay married because he was away from home so much.. on a submarine.. sometimes for 3 months... so that's how he managed to marry and divorce 3 wives whilst in the navy or they divorced him... then he had this crazy idea.. dating on the internet.. he was talking to an American lady.. he is British.. they got along alright on the internet..she got a visa and came over to Britain for 3 months'' in that short time of actually dating her.. they got married'' he went to live with her in New Hampshire USA...New England, the marriage lasted exactly 13 months.. then he left in the middle of a cold New Hampshire winter and moved him and his dog into a caravan.. 8 months later he moved back to Britain and filed for divorce.. 2 years later his 4th marriage was legally over and now he is looking on the internet for a soulmate or possibly for wife Nr 5...      How did you find your partner and knew .. she was the one or he was the one? Any funny hilarious ways some of you met?       I would be tickled to get to hear some great stories...

20081121124226AAKQRdo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it ok and wise to pursuit a player?	So there is this guy that I’ve liked for a couple of weeks.....but he is kind of a player      Like I heard he asked a girl out and the next day he was flirting with another girl. His last relationship (which ended on nov. 14) lasted for a week (he asked the girl out). I heard that he kind of likes this other girl now.      BUT I kind of think that he doesn’t do this on purpose. He is attractive so many girls flirt with him. I think he doesn’t realize that what he is doing makes him look like a “player”. I think he thinks it’s ok to do that. He is not a jerk btw.      So is it wise to pursuit a guy like this?          (ARG! I know I don’t know much about him....but he is really nice and funny.....I guess girls flirt with him and he ends up likeing him) idk

I know this girl likes me & i her, we have been on a lot of dates & everything is going well.      However we were meant to go cycling together this weekend, but when i clarified for saturday via text message around dinner time, it took her until 11am the next day to write back (she usually writes back much faster) to tell me she already has plans & that we should do it next week.      I sort of felt a little annoyed for some reason. She said she was sorry & forgot she had already made plans with her girlfriends, but me & her had planned this for ages!      If i was the girl, i'd have tried harder not to postpone the date.       So generally, do girls feel bad doing that kinda thing?   Is it a bad sign?

She likes to tell me how I need to get in the church and straighten my life out while we are having sex. She says she know she has my full attention during this time and that I will listen.

20090102171045AAR5Iz8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	MY GF HAS DEPRESSION, i said really mean things to her. What can i do?!?	its long i know, but its a life or death situation, she has said things like she doesnt even want to live before, but she has impulse control. She has depression so she cant be happy and she broke up with me, when she is drunk she will cry and say how much she loves me but, i have always felt like that was just an excuse but she needs someone in her life so i stay as her best friend, im there for her every second, compliment her, and i send her flowers/gifts but she takes it all for granted. I never get any affection in return, even as a best friend, she says things to me that hurt, and i hold them in until its to much. On nYE she said that in 6 months when she leaves for school 2 hours away she wont have to deal with anyone anymore, and i said well i can still come visit right, she replied with i dont know tony ill be busy maybe on breaks! I didnt say anything but it ate at me all night and i got really drunk and i said something that pissed her off, we left and went in the car and she said something that just set me off, i told her how i wished i never fell in love with her, and that she treats me like ******* ****, that every single day i am miserable because im in love with someone who gives me nothing back, it escalted and we were screaming at each other. she was crying/screaming uncontrollably. i told her how she is such an asshole to me, and gave her plenty of examples. i have never raised my voice to her, or disrespected her in the whole 8 months we have dated, even tho she constantly does it and we have began to fight a lot because i feel unloved. we fought about a week before this and she said the next fight and were done being friends. i sent her a message saying sorry, and when she is ready to give me some respect in return for all i do, then we could give it another shot if she wants, but no response in 2 days =[. is she really never going to talk to me again, i love her so much and it hurts more than anything. WHAT DO I DO, i dont know what she will do if im not there for her anymore!

20090127183111AADbMzf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How long does it typically take for a bipolar person to respond?	My bipolar 2 boyfreind of over a year and a half and I recenetly split (my doing). He is medicated but it hasn't been working and I've been trying to help him but he won't help himself. He's been verbally and emotionally abusive, and although I know he doesn't mean it, it's hard sometimes not to take personally. Recently, he was throwing himself into walls and started bleeding; when I tried to bandage him up he grabbed my wrists and dug his nails in and motioned that he was going to hit me. I firmly asked him what he was doing and he started sobbing on the floor and apologizing. Again, i know it's nothing personal, but I'm frustrated bc he's abusing pot and alcohol and not taking care of himself in any way. If he at least attempted it, i could work with the situation much better. Right now, staying in the relationship doesn't seem in either of our interestes-he needs to get help and start helping himself. The first year we had our ups and downs for a week here and there, but this is a solid 3 months of instability. Before I broke it off with him I called his parents and his doctor to get him help but. A short time after he texted me a few days later and asked if we couldn't work it out. i text him back that he needs to start taking care of himself and cut the drugs, drinking, eat correctly, etc and we'd talk. A few days later I thought better of it and wrote a letter to him stating what he needed to do and why I called his parents (he was upset at the time) and to read a book I bought for him  (the one of how to manage bipolar by julie fast). I know a large part of his problem is the medication, but also that he hasn't come to terms with his bipolar disorder. I know I can't make him do anything, and I said regardless I'd be here for him to talk to any time he needed me. i really want our relationship to work out, but won't go back unless he makes the attempt. It's been a few days and I haven't heard anything back, although he did text me to say he would read it. Is he possibly taking it to heart and reading the book, making an honest attempt before he contacts me, or slipping into a depressive/manic state? Do you think he'll even contact me?
20090128141233AA3UPGY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Um guys can you please tell me what this might mean?

But today i yelled at him because he doesn't like my bestfriend i said "Why the eff are you messin with her cause she didn't do anything too you" and i yelled and walked away.....well my friend saw it and told him too chase after me and he did it.....i was crying because i was so mad and he put his arm around me and told me too stop crying i told him to get off me and he didn't do it......did he chase after me because he likes me?

20080804122944AA55qTR	Family & Relationships;Friends	I think I did something REALLY BAD. Should I fix it or leave well enough alone?	My friend's sister is having an affair with one of their coworkers. This guy is not family.(most people in their company are family.) Everyone knows about it as this guy has proclaimed his love for her even to the mail carrier. I was visiting my friend and we went out for drinks. My boyfriend was driving. (not drinking.) We were pretty buzzed and decided to go knock on this guy's door as we knew her sister was there. Yeah, they were there and now they are both mad at us. I say how many times do drunk middle aged women get to play ding dong ditch with a designated driver. We said we were sorry, but they're both still mad. What should we/I do? Nobody was hurt. Yeah, it was stupid, but.....

20081215160226AAv5lEa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you help me with this guy problem?	itts like this.  i liked this guy (we will call him the Flirt) , the Flirt liked me, but then we just stopped talking and were more like friends. i find out his kinda a player (actually just more of a big flirt) and so i dont really want to like him nemore and stuff like that. but he keeps doing stuff to show me hes still interested, and i dont wanna be interested but he is the type of guy that is really impossible to resist. and on the other hand, i kinda like this other guy (we will call him Gorgeous) but he has a girlfriend (she lives in antoher state) and i thnk he has a crush on my friend, not me. and me, my friend, and both of the guys r on my soccer team.  btw, none of the guys know i like them.  and i would never cross the boundary of Gorgeous havin a girlfriend.  i mean, i would flirt with him, but definetly nothign more.

20080319194647AA6PWHX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This is a tough one, please help guys. or girls if you can help?	Alright, let me try and put this in a way that does not make me sound like a pig (though I am). I’ve been going out with my girlfriend for almost 2 years now. And not to say that she’s bad in bed, but the sex life has been going down hill. Now wouldn’t you know it I’ve made friends with this very attractive girl. And it would so happen that at this time she’s pretty desperate for some good sex herself. Well she has offered excitedly to help me out with my little problem while solving hers at the same time. The question here is not “should I go for it?” no, the question is- How in the world do I stop myself from doing her? I mean, like most guys I can’t easily control myself like that. And I have to tell you this is the ULTIMATE temptation for me. Because this girl regrettably is kind of EXTREMELY attractive. Please, there’s no need to tell me how much of a pig I am (among other things) I know that. Just please guys, girls, tell me what I can do to avoid having sex with this girl, but still be her friend.

Debieron decirmelo, no les parece?Ellos sabian que yo me moria por el y ni les importo.Hasta resulta que el le pedira matrimonio a la mujer y yo aqui muriendome de dolor.

I've liked him since before we even said two words to each other. And last year I got a boyfriend and my best friend stopped talking to me, its been going on for seven months now. I'll email and call him before he doesn't write back or answer the phone. Everyday at school, I catch him looking at me and then he'll look away. Every time we look at each other, I realize I think I'm head over heels for him. But then I heard he might be moving. I asked him and he said maybe and walked way. I don't want him to move when we aren't talking and I think I love him. I love him but I also love my boyfriend. I need help with this. What should I do? And why does he look at me and then look away?

We have great conversations and know heaps about eachother. We listen to the exact same music (which is how we first met, my brother introduced us because of our music tastes). We make eachother laugh and just all-around go well together. I've liked him for 6 months or so. I've never told him, but I've hinted at it before. But he goes out with other girls and talks about them a lot. Why? If he only wants to be friends, why is it? We have a great connection. Is there something wrong with me?

K, so basically, I've been friends with this guy "Danny" for a while now, we met because we had to do a spanish project together last year. Slowly we became really good friends, despite the fact that, he's a wanna be thug, he drinks, smokes marijuana, has an earing, long hair, and just got a tattoo with his initials. Not to mention, he "hits" as many girls as he possibly can. He's def. not BF material. Oh, and I'm one of the Classiest, preppiest girls at our school. I got a call a few weeks ago from him at 4 in the morning, he was in the hospital.. drug overdose. I've never cried my eyes out so hard. He almost died, despite all the bad things, I couldn't imagine living with out him. That night we talked until 11 the next morning, he said he loves me and that I'm his best friend.

I recently discovered that he has a girlfriend 2 months ago. I did not say anything at first. when I found out he has girlfriend, I felt worse. I controlled myself and prayed to God to make me stronger. But I have weak moments. sometimes I believe I see signs that he likes me too but I could not trust my judgment since I am vulnerable when I am with him. I am not afraid of rejection. But I feel huge pain in my chest every time I think about telling him.I also do not want to make him suffer/confuse. So, please feel free to give any opinion on what I should do next.

I had just been diagnosed with cancer and told him that I was dealing with the cancer, and did not have time for games or being played (not that he would do either but just letting him know), as I was dealing with the cancer.  Anyway I have been seeing him for a year now, very rarely see him.  I care a great deal about him, and he seems to care about me and what I have been going through concerning the cancer.  Anyway I have reason to believe he is seeing someone else after I told him I did not have time for games, etc.  I am still undergoing cancer treatment.

20081118170610AAFRAp2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i tell if this guy is just super friendly or trying to flirt with me?	Unless a guy is practically throwing himself at me or actually says, "I think you're attractive and want to date you", I SUCK at being able to tell when they're flirting/interested in me.       So there's this guy from my British Lit class. He invited me to hang out, but then he also invited this other girl from our class at the last minute and I learned that they take another class together and hang out sometimes after that one.       So I didnt feel special.       THEN, the following week he invited me out for a movie after class (didn't pay for my ticket or food) then he invited himself to go to the mall with me and one of my girlfriends.       We had fun together and though he mostly hung with me, he followed my girlfriend around a few times and they had a couple bonding moments (both of them are HUGE Adam Sandler fans so they started telling all these instead jokes).       Today I get an email from him asking if I'd be willing to take a look at this poem he wrote for his creative writing class. He said that he always appreciates feedback especially from beautiful women.       Friendly? Flirting? HELP!

(My parents of course are helping out with the majority of the other half)  He has a huge family and mine is very small.  We expect to send out approximately 400 invitations.  After estimating costs, $30,000 seemed to be just enough with all the essentials.  However, now the family is questioning the amount.  What do you think the average wedding of 400 guests should cost?

20090128211055AAyRCkW	Family & Relationships;Friends	PLEASE HELP ME!! WHAT SHOULD I DO SINCE I TOLD THE VICE PRINCIPAL ABOUT MY EX?	Okay so today, I talked to the Vice Principal at school and I told him my ex keeps stalking me, harassing me with his friends, and taunting me. I gave my ex a note and it didn't have no threats nor curse words. It just explained my feelings and was very logical and it didn't have anything bad in the note.      I also told the Vice Principal that it isn't fair because I have to go outside in 0 degree weather just go to class so I can avoid this whack-job. I should freely walk about the school. NOT go in 0 degree weather. That's just wrong!! Then we made a plan after that without me going in the cold. Also, my ex can't take no for answer so, he gets back at me by stalking me. What exactly he does to stalk me is today I was going to my science class and first I went to my locker and put coat in there. My ex at his locker and right when he saw me, he stopped what he was doing walked by me and kept looking back at me. I went into class and he and his friend kept walking back and forth looking at the classroom. I confronted him later and asked, "Is there anything you gotta say to me? Please stop stalkin me." He said, "you stalk me." Oh no i don't stalk him!!! I always avoid him and he's the one who stalk me and I don't know what his classes are.      Since I told the Vice Principal, what do you think his consequences will be? Suspension? Detention? A call home? Or what?      Also, should I get a restraining order? Should I move schools? Should I tell the police? And is there anything else I need to do about this problem? I already told my parents, my closet best friend, and a few teachers.      Due to techincal difficulty I posted the note to my profile, if interested. Click on my avatar and you'll be there

Okay let me start off by saying i'm 16 & i've never had a boyfriend:      What I do is I scope out my school for cute guys, find them, NEVER talk to them but fantasize about me and him & then stare and him in the halls salivating(ish). Obviously after some time the guy will start to notice me and since i am not hideous looking, he'll smile or whatever and look my way and begin noticing me & such. However, once I start to get to know him i totally loose interest and move onto someone else.    WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?? Should I talk to a psychologist or something, because i mean i WANT a boyfriend, and i don't want to end up as a spinster knitting toilet seat cozies & vests for my 3000 kitties when i am 90 years old.      if you can, please help *whimpers pathetically*

It's so annoying. The reason I feel kinda left out is because since they're always gushing about their boyfriends, and I don't have a boyfriend, (i have a stalker),  , i can't add anything to the conversation. One of my friends even said to me today (when they stopped talking about their boyfriends for a second) "Queen of Y!A, you need a boyfriend" and I'm like "I don't NEED a boyfriend"       (Do you think i should just get a boyfriend, or something?)

We have had sex and only got closer when his fling with a playa girl didn't pan out -- she wanted a relationship but he didn't.    They never had sex I know this for a fact because I'm now friends with the playa girl. When we became official, he was so sweet to me and told all his friends about me.    We broke up because I got drunk and kissed another guy. He hasn't spoken to me since, but the playa girl tells me he contacted her after we broke up to be "friends" and after his second relationship o/ 4-days to be "friends."    They were supposed to hang out last weekend but she cancelled every one of his meeting (three of them). On him Aim Status it reads: "Never Can Forget You, Never Will."     On my Aim status it reads: "I am sorry."    Is he talking to me or the playa girl? ADVICE, Plz, Thnx?

I really want to tell her how I feel just to get it out of me. We used to talk online everyday, but now we never talk anymore. I think she "blocked" me on msn messenger.

Please give me your advice, I really need help.      Also, what should I tell her? How should I ask her to talk to her? She's always surrounded by friends, so how can I ask her to talk to her without making it too obvious? Please write as much as you can to help me, I really need help.

20090128165804AAwcXyf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to accept the fact that you aren't hot anymore?	I'm a sophomore boy with unbelievably low self esteem. I've been getting hot girls to get interested in me or think I'm good looking since the beginning of the year. Honestly, I feel hot because these type of girls like me, girls that are always told that they are gorgeous and stuff, and honestly they are.       I've been hitting on one girl, and she was hitting on me. We haven't talked to each other. So its kind of walking down the hall and seeing this gorgeous person walking your way, and like crush crush kind of thing. She's kinda crazy about me, as she has followed me and makes up a reason to go some where because I go there. My friend always told me that she is interested in me, from what she says on Facebook. So I felt that if she looks at me and likes what she sees, I'm hot. Well, only yesterday she seems less interested now. Friday I was hot, now i'm not. I don't think she is interested anymore.      Also this other girl, hot, was hinting as she comes by to sit next to me and is nervous when I sit near her. She is obviously very pretty and probably has a lot of boy friends. Rumor said that she had grinded more than 8 guys at one dance. But recently, she just doesn't seem so interested in me anymore.      These are only two examples.   I don't need any help with the girl that I like, I just want to know why I lost some attraction points and accept that I'm probably ugly. I know its a pretty pathetic thing, only caring about such superficial things but I really don't have a personality and this makes me feel so much better about myself. I'm very bland though. I don't have much of a personality      Btw I'm Asian and the girl I like is asian while the otherS are white. Only to see if nationality has any factors in this.   Sry if it was long.   =]

20090128162614AA6Wm9c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What will you do if it was you?(please help)?	i talked to this girl for the first day and I ask for her num and she said she doesn't know me that much so she didn't want to give it to me.I saw the next day and I was talking to her and she went inside the restroom and I was standing infront of the restroom and we were talking(we talked for about 3 to 4 minutes)she ask for my name and I told her but she didn't get it.She sometimes sees me on the hallway and walk fast or stares at me like 2 seconds and turns away: so I saw her walking in the hallway after school and I called her and she came over, we started chatting and she said her friend thinks am cute, and I said am not interested,.      She was like I can hook you up,and I said I don't like nobody in the skool I only like one person and she looked deep into my eyes.She told me this guy(rodney) that I know likes her but she doesn't like the guy and she even told me where she lives( we talked for about 10 minutes and I walked her to the main entrance)she really pays attention to whatever I tell her and she gives me all the smiles.She even ask for my name and my grade and she said am cool, am not like the other guys,and I was like are we cool and she said yes but I need to get to know you more.       I really like her, do you think she likes me ?Nb; she finally told rodney she doesn't like rodney but she likes someoneelse and riight know she keeps on pointing at me to her friends whenever I see her. does she likes me or what?      She saw me standing next to my locker and she didn't even say hi, she just walked away and she saw me today and I try not to talk to her and she said, now you don't say hi no more and I said I didn't see her, I also said you don't even talk to me and she said because I don't see you. I ask her so whatz up and she said nothing but what about you and I said nothing and she saw her bus and said bye.       does she like me. we didn't say hi or talk for 1 week and she said hi to me today and I ask her can I walk you to class and she said okay and she was like, I you not going to be late? and I said is nothing and whiles we were taking she was holding her necklace and asking about my classes.i finally ask for her number again and she said her parents are strict and dont allow her to talk on the phone andshe said she hasn't seen me ina while, and i was like i was sick and she said i hope u get better.she also said she knows me know since she said she want to know me?plus she said is cool that we talk, should i just be friends with her, go for it or ignore her?
20090128172917AAJpFws	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What to do about this guy...winter formal?	So I asked this guy to sadie hawkins winter formal but I don't know him well. He's shy and we'd been smiling at each other for months so I figured I might as well ask him so I can get to know him (because I was too intimidated to talk to him otherwise)! We haven't bought our tickets yet but it's on Saturday and I got invited on a limo today so there's that option. However, that might be expensive so I could have one of our parents drive us. I just don't want it to be awkward all night since we aren't close yet. Or, I could ask him out somewhere else (I was thinking since we already have our formal clothes--or at least I do...I forgot to ask him but I'm pretty sure he does--it would be funny/cute to go out somewhere not so fancy in our dress/tux). what should I do?

20090128165541AAtrNkl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help me with this girl please?	I'm 16 turning 17 Junior   She's 16 sophomore      This girl is like no other girl I've met before. I've been around girls before but shes different. Everytime I talk to her I litteraly fall into her amazing eyes and freeze and the convo. ends. I sit to the right of her. Ive really messed up around with her. Here I'll give you the complete time table with me and her.      1. We meet for the 1st time in Sept.   2. We talk a little bit.   3. We move to a different place in the class but still next to each other.   4. I send her "how do you feel about me Q's" on myspace. She doesnt respond. I did that because I thought this other guy was trying to steal her but I was wrong he has a GF.   5. We feel a little awkward around each other for about a month.   6. I finally get the confidence to start talking to her again.   7. Around the middle of the class she turns around and writes weird things in my notebook.   8. We start talk/flirting again and I make her laugh.   9. We move agian and now she sits to the left of me.    10. Today she whines and sais (me) I need change for a $5.      Now not a lot but thats it.      Help me find out ways that she likes me. I.E. sais or does.    We're not in the same group friends shes popular, but single. Im a regular junior.       I cant figure out if she just thinks of me as a friend or more.       What are ways that I can do to give her the impression that I like her?      Thanks :D

20090128173740AAQbMBc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do i do????????

Well since i dont get to see him often he has a crush on these two girls. one of them he said he is crazy about and when she was in her panties he was all poking her and flirting with her (i wasn't there) and he likes this other girl and he said he held her by the waiste and hugged her. he says he truly loves me and madly in love with me but he said he doesn't know why he likes them and he is trying to forget about them. i really do love him... and we are hoping to last forever we truly want to even move out. he said he told me this stuff because he doesn't wanna hide things from me. which i kind of understand but it makes me so jealous and sad. then he said if he breaks my heart one more time we should move on...but i cant :( its so hard i really need him and want him. WHAT SHOULD I DO??
20090128172250AA3RuqI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I deal with commitment issues?	Hey all. I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with me and fix it and so I'm wanting to know what those of you with experience can offer me as far as advice goes. I believe I have commitment issues. Why, you ask? Because I have been in four relationships, each lasting only two weeks. It usually started with me being attracted to the person for weeks or even months, then asking them out, and then getting 'bored' after a week or two.      I don't really know how to say it and it makes me sound like a jerk, but I'm really a nice guy, I just stop wanting to hang out with my significant other. All of my relationships have been highly physical (although I chose the girls for personality), but sex-free (because I don't believe in sex before marriage).      Now I'm afraid to ask anyone out ever again simply because I don't want to hurt another person just because I'm 'bored', but I still want to have relationships and experience love at least once in my life. How do I deal with this?

Its her birthday soon and  i said when would you like to celebrate your birthday?  (her actual bday was on a school night so nobody could come).  She kept saying its just my birthday, lets figure it out later.  Then finnally i said were doing it now, cause her bday was 5 days away, then i made the facebook event, but since it was made so late not to many people could come, and she got so mad at me for it.  then if i dont sleep at her place atleast 5 times a week she gets really mad at me.  If i forget my plate on the table and dont put it in the sink she gats mad at me.  she gets mad at everything?
20090128185835AAOp1TD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: I need some help decoding guy thoughts?	I have this friend and he told me that he was in love with me a few weeks ago. I really like him too. Well at least I did until he decided to tell me that he was all of the sudden going out with this 16 year old chick and we're only 14. I was SO mad. So I called him and I was nice about it and I said "Why are you going out with her? You told me you loved me! I can't believe you would do that to me!" Then he started telling me that I was crazy and that I don't make any sense. He kept laughing at me. He's never ever EVER been mean to me before. He was just being stupid. He kept asking me why I was mad. He asked EIGHT times. Is it really that hard to understand?      He tells me he's in love with me, he goes out with a random sixteen year old, I'm a little ticked.      Is it that hard? Could you tell me whats so hard to understand about that!!! Please. Thanks.

20090128155040AAXmgNq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need... advice, please?	Alright. I don't really know how to form this, and it probably sounds so cliche. Butttt.... there's this guy.  I like him a lot. He lives like 250 miles away, and I see him about once a month. We sleep together- not together, but in the same bed. We caress and all that and everything is wonderful. But then today I saw him again, he came to my house to get snow shoes and he didn't say a word to me. Before he came up he was making all of these plans of what we would do when he came up, and now none of it is happening. I'm really, really shy so I think I am giving him mixed signals. Ican't help but not talk when I'm with him. I try to make myself, but it all sounds so stupid.  And this sounds really stupid. But I am really torn about what to do. I don't want to loose him.     Thank you, all for reading this, I am so grateful.

20090128172348AAInCy5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean when a girl smiles at you one time but looks away the other?	So just yesterday, this girl ive seen times before, was walking towards me. I of course looked at her and he looked at me and smiled, and I smiled too, without even knowing. The smile gave me butterflies and made me happy. But a couple days earlier, she was walking towards me but she had her head looking the other direction when I was looking at her. What does that mean? Is she interested?
20090128161630AAd7n1O	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's up with this guy?	My friend and I both liked the same guy. He liked both of us and flirted with both of us. He payed me more attention than her though... but chose her over me in the end (probably because she was 'easy'). He hid the relationship from me for 6 months. Whenever anyone asked him if he was dating my friend he denied it. When I stopped hanging around with them, that's when I found out they had been dating for 8 months!      A year on, the guy sent me a text message and started talking to me and flirting. Him and the girl are no longer together (they ended 5 months ago). Now he is trying to get me to go to his house, keeps wanting to know what I'm up to and always turns up to parties I am in.      In the last party (5 days ago), he took things a bit too far. He was following me around most of the night and then kept sending me dirty messages the next day (we were kind of drunk but that's no excuse). I had enough so I told him I don't like him like that no more and that I value our friendship. He instantaneously changed his mode to 'friendship' and spoke to me about other girls. Hmmm.      I haven't heard from him since 4 days ago. He normally texts me every 1-2 days. What do you think is up with him?
20090128160751AAsmBsY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I dont know what i have done wrong?	i have been friends with this girl for about 4 years and i started to fall for her so i asked her out and she said that she needs to think about it, a couple days later she stopped talking to me and whenever i approach her she mumbles and walks away. its been around 4/5 months since this happened and i want to know how to get the friendship back.
20090128162915AArmlSv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think good looking women have more relationship and dating hastles?	I was chatting to a friend and we both think that good looking women have more relationship hastles, then the adverage or less physically attractive ones. Also adverage looking couples are less insecure in relationships.      I just wondered what people think?
20090128150428AAoQtGX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Torn between the two? Has anyone gone through this?	I'm sure a lot of you have but I never have and I'm confused. I've been with my current boyfriend almost 3 years now, I'm happy but yes it could be better. I dated this guy about 4-5 years ago and I ran into him a couple weeks ago at a mutual friends party and it was like a rekindled fire. We didnt break up on bad terms-we broke up basically as a break for him to get some stuff in line n whatever but then we lost touch. Seeing him again just about broke my heart because we both have feelings for eachother and I've missed him a lot over this time. I'm not sure if breaking things off with my current boyfriend is logical over just seeing and talking my ex again and I do love my boyfriend, obviously we wouldnt have been together for 3 years if I didnt. But when I saw my ex and he gave me a long overdo hug all these feelings came rushing into me like a wave....I dont know what do to. :(

Ok, so I am in seventh grade and there are three girls that I really like. One I have went out with before but it was just ok. The second one is a cheerleader, were always making fun of each other like calling each other names and stuff but I can tell she kind of likes me. The third one I have just started talking to and she shows a little interest but with time I think she will like me.         I can get any of them the 1st one right now and the others within two or three weeks. Which one do you think I should choose? And if the 2nd or third one do you think I should take things slower or faster.         Thank you
20090128212504AA5ZYhe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you tell if a nice guy likes you ?	ok theirs this really nice guy at my school it seemed like he might like me but, because he nice to all the other girls to I can't tell whether he's just being nice or if he actually likes me. please tell if there are any sign or something to try please just help I really don't know this one !
20090128153247AA5UV9M	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys who would you choose?	Girl A:   You really like her, but the problem is she lives over 600 miles away. 2 Summers ago, you ended things with her because it got hard. She's a city girl, and you're more country but somehow your personalities clicked. She had quickly become one of your good friends from the start. And you can speak to her about anything.       Girl B:   You've known her for years and she's always liked you. You guys share all the same interests and have fun. But you can't stand her family because they all pretty much just sit around, and when you go over they ask you for money. You went out with her a few weeks after ending things with Girl A. Basically she was rebound because you still have feelings for Girl A.       You continue dating Girl B for half a year, but you soon you can't stand her jealousy and her family, and more importantly, Girl A are talking more and more again, and you realized you still have feelings. So finally you broke up with Girl B. And You and Girl A are just complicated..but content. You will be going to Girl A's prom in June.      Here's the problem:    Girl B is not over you, and she made clear that you, her family and your family know it too. So now you have many people being disappointed at you for leaving hurting her, and since her dad has been hitting her, you start feeling bad for not being able to be there for her, the way she wants you to.      At the same time, you don't want to be a dick and hurt Girl A all over again. A repeat of the summer, AND with the same girl no less. Also, this time Girl A said she won't wait for you anymore and you will just remain a friend. You want to be with Girl A, but the circumstances aren't helping, and you want to be responsible with Girl B.      Who would you choose? Girl A, who you have more chemistry with but is far fetched or Girl B, who needs you and whose friendship you also miss.

20090128153250AAaoUCZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just found out my ex-fiance cheated on me 4 times. Now what?	Ben and I started dating in October of '09. 5 months into our relationship, he got my roommate/best friend drunk, and tried to get her to cheat with him, on me. Nothing REALLY happened, so when she finally fessed up, I forgave both of them. 3 months later, Ben e-mailed one of my other close friends, and told her that if him and I were not dating, he would "so be with her". Again, he got turned down, and since nothing really happened, I forgave him AGAIN when she sent me the e-mails. 16 months went by, where it seemed he was completely faithful. He propsed, and I said yes.      Being a FOOLISH girl, I cheated on him. Ya. it was dumb. But I knew how much it hurt to be cheated on, and to find out from someone other than your significan other. So i confessed to him what happened. He made me feel like ****. but its understandable. I had done something horrible. We broke off the engagement, and I spend the next 2 months trying to make things up to him.    But ok. here's where the probelm comes in:   Yesterday, we were in a huge fight and I threatened him with changing my #. I told him I had a feeling he was lying to me about something big, and he wouldnt tell me. He panicked and finally fessed up to having cheated on me with two girls. In my mind, the first two girls were cheating, so that makes 4 girls he has cheated on me with. All of them happened before I did my thing.   I dont know what to do. Im mad at him for making me feel SO shitty, when he really had no room to speak. He had already cheated on me 4 times. 2 of them, with my close friends. He wants to get back together, but I dont trust him at all. He is my best friend, and there's a huge hole in my life without him there. but every time i see him, i feel nauseaus cuz all i can imagine is him with these other girls.   I am so confused as to..what to do now.    I cannot talk to my parents about this. Just too akward. I want some good good advice. please =)

My boyfriend and I have been together in a committed serious relationship for a year and a half. We are currently on a break because we are in a rut and are taking some time to think about things. I have been doing a lot of reflecting and have realized that I would really like to give it a second chance. I would like our relationship to mature into the next level and prove that it really was just a "rough patch" we were going through.    After a week long break we are meeting at a restaurant to talk. What if I tell him all about how I want to give it a shot, I want us to communicate more and that I want our relationship to mature and grow to the next level... and he says he feels the opposite and doesn't think anything will change and that a break up is the only answer?? I don't know how to convey my point any more or make it more clear without it seeming like I am begging. What should I do?

Very long girlie explanation, if you wish not to read all don't answer my question)      Here goes...   I enjoy going to raves and gothic/cyber goth clubs. Anywhoo I usually don't dance if my female friends aren't there because my male friend dances all over the floor and leaves me alone.   One night it was going to only be 3 of us going. My female friend said she was too tired and stayed home. So I went with the guyfriend.   Most of the night I stayed leaning on this random leopard couch (enjoying the music...being an outcast) watching my friend beast at dancing.   Earlier I noticed a guy I had met before at a bar with friends. (Weeks in the past) I was tired and had my eyes closed and my foot shaking (sitting down). He said to me across the table "are you cold'? confused I said, "Are you talking to me"? Blah..blah I wasn't interested because he was sitting next to this really nice girl, who I thought was his girlfriend. I don't like being that type of girl so I brushed it off. He then said I looked like his ex...once again I showed no interest (Stupid! Stupid!)   I should mention he was very cute, funny, and had tattoos (I'm a sucker for tattoos!)   Fast Forward (Club)   I noticed him, and this perverted douchebag who I turned down and laughed at weeks ago, was whispering something in his ear (Probably mean bullshit) (*Note: I was mean to him because he touched me inappropriately and hit on a full blown lesbian and all my friends, he goes to these things to get laid...by anyone!)   I think he (cute guy) would randomly lean on a wall across from me and look at me...I really can't tell it was dark.   He turned down many other hoochie girls also.   Then this nervous guy tries to hit on me (Not attractive to me).   I didn't want to be mean so I talked to him anyway (I'm not a *****...I swear!)   While I was talking to him the cute guy comes over to talk to the couple next to me.    (I was like...WHY GOD!)   Anyway he gets into a conversation with them about his tattoos. (They are literaly right next to me)   He then starts showing off his tattoos (*Mouth Waters*)   HE HAD ONE ON HIS ARMPIT!!!!!!!   I am now turned away from the other guy and drooling over him (really)   I tell my male friend in panic to help me get rid of the other guy. He rapps his arms around my waist from the chair while sitting (I freak out)   The cute guy later leaves but the other guy doesnt (What I deserve)   My friend says we gotta go (DAMN his cerfew!!!)   I've been told by my friends, who have heard this till their ears bleed, that the cute guy was showing off to me and I should have made a move (I felt like the entire night he was waiting for me to approach him...*cough* I'm not crazy).   Our community is very small and we see the same *** people almost everywhere. My male friend said I will most likely see him again. But what should I do when I do?   (Whew...It's over! LONGEST QUESTION EVA!)

My previous relationship was with a controlling person. He would tell me how to spend my money and on what. Sometimes we would have arguments(which became more frequent) and he would curse at me. he would use very strong language. and he seemed to never have time to call me when he isnt even doing anything. we also would play fight but sometimes it got serious and he would get rough. i would tell him thats enough and he would still be VERY angry.

Since he got it he hasn't talked to me or approached the subject with me at all! The thing that is kind of comfusing is my best friend says that he keeps staring at me like he likes me. What do I do? Should I go and talk to him? Should I wait and let him come talk to me? This is the first time that I have been to this dance so I am unsure of how to do these things.....Thanks!!!!

20090128185348AAeoUVN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The first time I met his mom, she walked in on me... naked?	My boyfriend was at his mom's place so I went to see him there.  I was supposed to meet his mom a few months ago, but I ended up getting sick and didn't meet her.  anyway, i was with my boyfriend at his mom's place, and we had sex .  he went to the bathroom, and while he was there, his mom came home, and opened the door to his room (his old room from when he lived there, he's 21).  i was putting my clothes on and just had on a thong, and was about to put on my bra when she walked in.  i could have died of embarrassment.  i apologized, then she apologize and closed the door.  then my boyfriend came back to the room, and i told him what happened.  he seemed completely un-phased.  i asked him if he even cared and he just kinda shrugged and said "well... i told u to get dressed."  i still haven't been formally introduced to her. i don't know how i can ever see her, after that first-impression!  what should i do?  what does she probably think?

He's not like...hitting me or anything, or being physically aggressive, he just teases me a lot. I was having a bad day a week ago, and we sat down to have lunch together, and he just starting picking on the most unneccessary things. 'Your hair looks flat today.', or 'You really shouldn't be eating that', the list goes on and on. He started doing that like a week ago, and has been just ragging on me everyday since then. He laughs about it, and I I think he's trying to joke around, but its not very funny to me. How do I tell him without making him feel stupid?

She makes me feel like a ghost cause I'm standing in front of her and she just walks straight, but like I said before, in the hallway she looks at me from far away and when we get close she smiles. And today, when we were in the library, her sister left her alone, and it seemed she didn't want to look at me cause she turned her head to the side until her sister came back (I was sitting in front of her)

How do i know that i should just stay with her forever and that im not missing out on anything? i mean i havent really had many serious relationships, this is the longest relationship ive had, (also been friends with her for about 2 years before that) but im still young and i almost get the feeling like, if i stay with her, my life is done and ive already experienced it all in that area.

20090128165845AAZFwBX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Shouldn't i feel happy about asking her out?	So, me and this girl have kinda been flirting for a month, she found out i liked her, i told her in person later, and she was very happy to hear it. After i told her school kinda became awkward, and we didn't talk much, and yesterday, i am not sure what happened. I had a friend tell her to meet me in the school library, and when she got there i asked her out. We have this project next week that we have to do some research for, so i asked her if she wanted to meet me later this week at a local coffee shop to get the research done, and that way we could talk a little. She kinda stuttered for a sec, and said "oh sure, i just have to make sure i don't already have stuff going on". She seemed happy, but i am not sure. I didn't feel good when we walked away, did i just put her on the spot, and force her to be nice? I am considering texting her and apologizing for putting her on the spot, and telling her that if she is busy, she shouldn't worry about meeting me. I know i should have felt happy, but i truly didn't.
20090128171104AA8aGG8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hypothetical question for the ladies?	When you are with a guy that you are insanely attracted to, do you feel that you make rational decisions. Im not talking about being in love.      Say you were asked whether you would sleep with a guy that you were insanely attracted two after first meeting him. Then say that you met a guy that you were insanely attracted to after first meeting him and you had to make the same decision.       Do you think that your actions or thoughts when confronted with these questions would be at all different between these two scenarios?

20090128182806AA9dWxd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do in this situation?	My ex and I broke up over the holidays. We have broken up many times throughout our relationship of 2.5years. He is 32 and I am 28. The reason we break up all the time is b/c he doesn't treat me right. He lives an hour away and I rarely get to see him. I was lucky if I saw him 2 days out of the week. Not b/c he was busy but just b/c he wanted to do everything but see me. Always has excuses & puts me last on the list.  He never took me to meet his family, never took me on a vacation &would lie to me. Basically treated me like a an obliagation rather than a girlfriend. I would get so frustrated and hurt that we would argue about this stuff all the time to the point we had to breakup. His behavior was completely unacceptable. Everytime we break up he starts missing me though and will call me and want another chance. Obviously I love him and want things to change so I take him back. Things are good for while then go back to being bad again.  Recently he called me and wants to be friends. I have made it very clear that I want a real relationship with him, that I am in love with him and that don't want to be friends. I will NOT be the friend with benefits. Out of the question. I want to marry this man! I Its a lose lose for me. I love him despite our arguments and his neglectful behavior. It wasn't always like that. I fell in love with a somebody who felt the same way I did. I wish I could be friends but when we do talk my feelings resurface and I definitely want more. What should I do? Is there any thing that can help my chances of getting this guy to want a commited relationship? I want him to marry him. He says he loves me and that he isn't ready. I am so confused. Please sincere help. I feel really bad right now.

I got just enough hair but not to much.      6. work out  4days a week and keep body in shape      7. got a six pack      8. drink protein shakes and take good vitamins      9. give myself pedicures      10. always look in the mirror and love to see myself.      Ok what do you think? No I am not gay ok! I just think I take care of myself. I am not afraid to get dirty I just clean up well when I go out. I know I do love myself a lot and sound conceited but I am a nice person and treat others fairly. Your opinion?

We've been together 1.5 years and its been great. One thing that I had to change on my side in order for this relationship to wark was to be more independent and give him his space.             Lately he's very much into his work and doesn't email me or call during the day at all. If I ask something he answers really short. AT Night we talk for 10 min... I asked him many questions arround marriage ,, kids, and he seems to be very interested and responsive. However, when I mentioned if I should renew my lease he said yes... so he does not want to move in with me when we make 2 years. I am waiting for him to call... nothing... When I sleep over his place he watches football untill very late...and I go to bed bymyself....          Is this realtionship going anywhere? I don't know any more... What do you think?

20061123094004AAoA4B5	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have two friends who just back stabbed each other, and they want me to chose what side I should be on?	I have these two friends and one of them just got the other one in trouble big time. One of them doesn't like this aid/assaint teacher, she doesn't leave her alone to do her work. She keeps taking her out of class to work on other stuff. Obviously she doesn't like that, so she talks bad about her behind her back. My other friend decided one day to tell the teacher what she has been saying behind her back. At lunch my friend came with a red nose and watery eyes. She told what happend and wants to find out who told the teacher all the things she has been saying behind her back. In math, my friend said she had a postive feeling it was the other girl, because she was a kissup to her and such a miss-goody-good too shoes to her. So my friend emily went to go ask if she told on her. Emily came back saying that she did. My friend was really mad at her now. So during english class, the girl who told the teacher, asked me if I was mad at her.  I said no, but I really was. What side do I choose??
20070308205829AAPVjnq	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I stop thinking about this?	My brother is a drug addict and has been for the past 11 years.  He will always be a nobody and worthless.  He steals from my entire family, has no job because he's lazy, lives with my grandma, and has my poor grandma on S.S. buy him drugs, food, and cigarettes.  My mom still loves him and she said when she dies, she will give him money, and he will spend it all in one day on drugs.  While, I will spend it on college and invest it.  I want him dead, I always have been, my happiest time was when he was in jail.  Everyone always tries to bail him out, and the first chance I get, I will put him back in jail forever.  I seriously hate him, and I can't stand to hear his name.  I get so mad at my mom everytime she mentions him and I won't talk to her.  I work so hard and she treats us the same.  I just want him to be locked up for life until he dies because he causes the family so much problems.  My dad even hates him and won't let him in our house.
20070314231742AAncmxf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	We never had sex, is that why my ex-boyfriend still talks to me?	OK I'll try to make this short. I dated my ex for a short time then HE ended it. He's 26, I'm 21. He has lots of experience with dating, while he was my first kiss & first bf. Our relationship was so innocent, cuddling in his room, holding hands, kissing. We never had sex cuz he knew I wanna save sex for marriage. He would still say hi to me on msn even though HE ended it. It has been over for more than ONE YEAR. 2 months ago, he called me, after one yr. & wanted to make plans together so we could see a movie sometime. We set a date, he picked me up & after the movie he took me home. IOn the drive home, when I asked him why he wanted to see me, he said that he wants to "see me every once in awhile". I felt disrespected so when I got home I said "bye forever" to him on msn. Then I felt bad so a week later I said sorry to him on msn. Since then I have said hi to him 2 on msn. Then a few days ago he said hi to me on msn & he wanted to know what I had been up to.

There is nothing I can do about it because its seasonal and I live in a city where its overcast 90% of the time and sun lamps don't work on me. My parents keep talking about moving, but they haven't taken any action. I can't stand to see my life go to waste just because of something as easy to fix as that. I am going to literally fail high school if they don't.      Don't say it's their choice or any sh*t about jobs. Don't answer with another question. Don't give me BULLSH*T!

He is going away soon for 11 weeks travelling and now im scared he is going to dump me because he is going away.

I need to tell him how i feel, and make some kind of promise that i will be here when he gets back. Please help been in tears for hours, am i overreacting?

20070423094526AA3h0Ts	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I thought it wasn't working but maybe it is???	I had this friend whom I was always texting and talking to, and he was always there for me. It meant so much. In the end, we fell in love. However, he was younger. Before committing for good, I think he wanted a bit more experience. I started going out with another guy, and he with another girl, and it just was horrible and heartbreaking---I felt hurt, and he came to terms and figured we'd always be friends. He acted really mean as he was moving on, and I was very hurt. So, though he and I both kept trying to get back together, we never really were able 2. I finally went back and saw him, and realized he wasn't a jerk, and he realized that the last yr shouldn't have happened. We decided on a fresh start, and he looked thrilled, but not much is happening. Actually, just before writing this, he called me to say he had gotten some confusing emails--what was up?? Was all okay? Then he said he's up for talking, but the ball's really in my court. What does that mean? I really like him...?

II've known this guy from graduate school for a couple of months and now we've gone out on a few dates now.  He talks a lot and doesnt seem shy to tell me about pretty much anything, family, friends, old girlfriends, whatever.  However, he seems pretty independant and I can't tell if he likes me with potential for more or if he just wants to see me every once in a while.

20070207175048AAZRWgx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This has been bothering me...can you help?	I've been great friends with this guy at work.  He knows I've had a crush on him for a long time.  But I heard he was gay.  I never suspected this in the 2 and a half years that I've known him.  He never mentioned it.  I figured the reason he hasn't said anything about his feelings for me, was because we aren't supposed to date people we work with at our company.  But he flirts with me and he gets really close to me.  So I'm wondering if he is gay, why would he flirt with me?  Or is he straight and actually does like me in that way?   This has been bothering me for about a month.  I'm too shy to ask him, though it has come to the point where its bothering me so much I want to know?  Any thoughts?

What are some ways that I can go about approaching guys?  I have somewhat of a severe fear of rejection, but I'm 20, and I figured it's time I grew up and got over it...but it's not that easy for me...I used to have low self-esteem..and I'm still fairly new in my self-confidence now, and I guess I fear that I'll damage it all over again...lol...What ways can I ease into it and get myself used to the idea of approaching guys?....I'm not a bad looking young lady, and I notice a guys here and there that give me double-takes and flash flirty smiles, but neither of us do anything about it...      So I figured, if I can figure out how to stop being such a WUSS and initiate conversation, maybe I'd be better off...lol      Has anybody else experienced this fear of rejection?..if so, what are some of the things you've done to get over it?

20070403114009AAMiqZl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I leave or stay patient?	Ok so I've been dating this guy officially for about 4 months now and I've known him 7 months.Things from the beginning were rocky because at first I had a bf and he got tired of waiting for me to leave him so he started talking to some other girl from some town that he visits cause hes got family there but its like 3 hrs away.Well I broke up with my bf and me and him started to date when I started having more feelings for him I asked him one day where he and I stood and where he stood with her and he told me that he could see starting a relationship with me and that he knew things wouldnt work with that other girl because of their distance.He became super sweet and wanted to see me more and more and so I made time for him even though w/school it was hard. I didnt ask him if he was still talking to that girl cause I really wasnt worried about her since things were going so well between me and him and since she lived 3hrs away. Well just this past wkend me and him for the first time

20070403124139AA0hNYw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's wrong with this relationship?	My boyfriend gets mad out of no where lately. He usually says i dont care about our relationship, this is really stressing me and affects me by assisting school. Sometimes i dont even want to dial his phone number because i just feel like if he hears me i will just get him mad. I don't like feeling like this. I really love him alot with all my heart. We've had problems in the past but i dont know quite sure if that is what's affecting him. He just thinks i dont care about him, and this just confuses me over and over i tell him i do! because i really do but he's being so hard-headed and not beleiving. I think that maybe he's lost trust  but lately is like everything is fine when were together but when were talking in the phone a fight starts out of no where! I dont know what to do this is killing me and making me so depressed i cry every day to sleep i dont remember the last time i didn't cry. What can be wrong??

We became best friends and I've been completely in love with her for the last 3 years. I fell in love with her the second I saw her. We've had classes together for the last 3 years and i thought she started to like me. I kept having these strong urges to kiss her. I would get weak at the knees when I was around her and get butterflies in my stomach and I would get really nervous around her. The thing was I just couldn't ask her out. Every time i would try to ask her, I would freeze up and i tried to ask her out for 3 years.      She just got a boyfriend and i'm just completely heartbroken. I feel completely devastated and sad. She's the only thing I can think about. I'm trying to get over her but I just can't stop thinking about her. It hurts so much. I know I have to get over her but I just can't. I can't even sleep anymore and its driving me crazy. We see each other everyday in class. and i can't get over her. It's so painful when she kisses her boyfriend in front of me. She was the only part of my life that brought me true happiness.  The only reason i wanted to go to school was so I could see her. I just need some help getting over her. Can you help me out here?

Also I know you need to have good breath and when I do kiss someone, I won't be afraid to ask the guy if I am a good kisser or not because I want to be able to improve.

20070530162511AAyAe2j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want a girlfriend badly but dont know how to approach one?	I've been dying for one ever since the middle of this year. I see all these hot girls and I'm scared to ask em out because I got rejected before. And I feel like people are judging me in my school based on my appearence, I think that I'm good looking and so do a lot of other people it's just that theres a lot of people who stare at me and that makes me uncomfortable, especially girls. And I knew this girl for a couple days than asked her out and she rejected me, oh well. But I know that I have to get to know girls first, the prob is getting to know them and becoming friends with them. I only have guy friends so girls are basically like another species to me when becoming friends with them. I hate my life.

20061206231824AASLHD3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I continue to see him if my mom likes him too?	I am currently talking to my life long crush whom I've liked since age ten. As a kid my crush had a crush on me and my mom. But that was then. I asked him about this and he admitted that he once did.  He and my ex- step dad hung out a few times and one day he said to my dad "Man I want your wife", which I assume was a joke, othrwise I'm sure  my dad would have gotten upset. Anyway my dad told my mom this and she has taken it to her head. She keeps trying to convince me that he is no good for me and that I should leave him alone because he likes her. She keeps on insisting that I give her his number so she can call and sweet/ sex talk him to prove to me that she can have him if she wants and he only likes her! I believe that my mom secretly wants to have sex with him and is jealous. Whenever I bring up his name she only has negative things to say and constantly rubs it in my face that he wants her which I know is not true.      I wouldn't trust my mom around him so should I let him go?

20070311131058AAz6Tpm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Long distance relationships?	I've never had a serious relationship before, so would it be a bad idea to have my first be somewhat long distance? The guy I like goes to another school. Here's the long version if anyone's dying to know :)...      I met this guy through an SAT prep class where we met every Sunday and Wednesday. We got to know eachother a bit and got along really well. He's really nice and I kinda got the vibe that he liked me. I'm pretty shy though, and wasn't able to give him my number before the last class ended. However, he said I should come see a play he was in at his school in a couple weeks. I don't know if that was hinting at anything. But I've decided to go, and I'm hoping I can meet up with him after the play. If things go well, should I give him my number or ask for his? I don't really know how this goes, so please help out a beginner... Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

Okay my friend came over and she brought her cousin (C) with her. We talked the whole time and joked around. It was fun. We smiled and like had good eye contact. Then we played basketball, and i jokingly hit him on the stomach. And then he was like, why don't you try that again with your fingers. and then I did, and we went back to playing. When they were leaving, he lifted up his shirt to show me his six-pack. The next sunday he came back, i didnt invite him or anything, he just showed up. We flirted again and everything. Then, the next week we texted from 3 pm-9pm. It was a more than friendly conversation if you know what I mean... Then I texted him like 3 days later and he hasn't replied. It has been like 3 days. He didn't call or anything. What's up with that?

20070512205441AA2t2uz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Insecure?  Jealous?  I am not sure, should I be?	OK... here is the deal.  I met this girl and we totally "clicked."  Things were great for about 2 months and then I felt like things were getting serious so I asked for some space... which she gave me, but went on a date (just dinner) with an on/off again ex-bf.  Well, long story short, I expressed my disappointment to her in a matter-of-fact tone of voice and she said I was reading too much into it, and it was nothing.  So I trusted her and we continued our relationship... BUT...    Since then she hardly talks to me (2 months later now) or is physical with me and it seems like the fire is out but I realllllly like her... the reason i wanted space was to sort thru my feelings for her.      We went to a concert together and she talked about a different ex AND texted even another ex about 20 times during the concert... trying to make me jealous?  So I told her I thought it was rude and she told be that she has too much crap in her life than to deal with jealous bf..  to the curb for her?

20070513144100AARtg7U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	First time?	It's your first time. As you lie back your muscles tighten. You put him off for a while searching for an excuse, but he refuses to be swayed as he approaches you. He asks if you're afraid and you shake your head bravely. He has had more experience, but it's the first time his finger has found the right place. He probes deeply and you shiver; your body tenses; but he's gentle like he promised he'd be. He looks deeply within your eyes and tells you to trust him - he's done this many times before. His cool smile relaxes you and you open wider to give him more room for an easy entrance. You begin to plead and beg him to hurry, but he slowly takes his time, wanting to cause you as little pain as possible. As he presses closer, going deeper, you feel the tissue give way; pain surges throughout your body and you feel the slight trickle of blood as he continues. He looks at you concerned and asks you if it's too painful. Your eyes are filled with tears but you shake your head and nod for him to go on. He begins going in and out with skill but you are now too numb to feel him within you. After a few moments, you feel something bursting within you and he pulls it out of you, you lay panting, glad to have it over. He looks at you and smiling warmly, tells you, with a chuckle; that you have been his most stubborn yet most rewarding experience. You smile and thank your dentist. After all, it was your first time to have a tooth pulled.
20090225160422AAhqyxb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you make of this?	I have this guy friend. We're not very close or anything but we used to sit together in a lesson. He is a sensible type of guy and doesn't mess around. His friends does so he follows them around but doesn't really get involve much.   When we talk, he doesn't look at me straight. When he does, he doesn't look at me for more than 2 second before turning away. But like sometime when we're at a distance and see each other, we would just look at each other. And sometime, I notice him looking at my direction (I don't look at him).   We've had a lot fun sitting together but now that we don't anymore, I doubt we'll talk much.   And sometime his friends can be harsh to me or tease me but he never really joins in. He did annoy me and tease me but just when we were sat our own.   What do you make of this? He try to irrate me but doesn't join in when his friends does? Never look at me properly when he talks? Why is this?

20090225160645AAMqTUR	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does he care about me? Why want he talk to me?	I have a weird relationship with one of my guy friends.      We started about talking but he wanted to be friends.       Were just friends now but we’ve gotten into a few arguments, we haven’t though lately. But after every argument we always make up.      He flirts with me a lot and kind of leads me on.    But he always says he only likes me as a friend.       He’s talk to other girls but it never lasts. We always come back to each other I guess you can say. He stares at me or looks at me almost every time I’m near him at school.      We haven’t talked in over a week. I’m waiting to see if he will actually talk to me first.       But I just want to know if he actually cares if I’m in his life or not.    If I continue to just wait for him to talk to me will he actually talk to me or will he just move on completely?      I’ve told him before that he doesn’t want me in his life then just to tell me but he freaked out and asked if I really meant it and said that’s ridiculous to say.      Its like, though, he thinks I'm mad at him when I don't talk to him for a while, that's not true at all.      Oh and he's 17 and I'm 16.

20070531100217AAv7AAJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex-boyfriend keeps calling.?	I met this girl a few months ago and we are now b/f and g/f.  The problem is that she has been calling her so called ex-boyfriend many times and he visits her all the time.  I did not know what was going until a few months later when I got a phone call from her ex wanting to know where she was.  She talked to him and said it was over and to him.  But it wasnt a couple days later that I knew she was talking and seeing him again.  Well about a month later, I was seeing her the entire time, I call and call and call and no answer.  So I called again and here she is saying how her ex is over at her apartment harassing her.  So I called him because I had his number. He said they were having lunch in her apartment and when the phone rang she got angry,he just thought I was her friend and I thought she left him.Well now, two weeks later she says she is done with the ex and doesnt answer phone or see him.I called again to tell him to leave her alone.She says she cares about me, can I trust her?

20061228230201AAYzBDn	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is there FUTURE here? 60-year old prof and 32-year old woman facing barriers (language, education, health).?	Joe’s worried about his health and he’s after a woman he met overseas--his sister-in-law’s cousin who is excited about a better life in the US. His words to her: “Yes, I do a lot of brain work at school. And I know that you do not do much brain work. But I don’t look for a woman who is like me-she I could find in America. I look for a different type of woman, one with a warm and loving heart, who wants to make a happy, restful home for me. I want a woman who is kind, who doesn’t like to argue or fight, but who will always take care of her man-if I am healthy or sick. And I will promise to take care of my woman with money and protect her and help her mother. I want a woman with a big heart, not a big brain. I want a woman who can help me relax and smile and laugh, and always be helpful and true to me. And I will promise to be true and faithful to her, and care for her so she does not need to work hard or worry about money. That is what I’m looking for, and what I promise.”
20061226192603AAp5DCp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a case of unrequited love?	I developed strong feelings for a prof in grad school. I felt he was romantically interested in me, but our big age difference would keep him from making a move. So before graduation I wrote him a letter about my feelings. He said he was flattered, but feelings like mine sometimes happened between students/profs. Some months later, we hooked up again working in collaborative projects long distance and we met occasionally. I grew hopeful that he’d stop seeing me as a student. Three years later, I talked about my feelings again. He said he cared for me, but not the way I’d want him to.“There’s nobody else. It’s just my current life situation.” Later, I heard he’s been having memory issues and he’s planning to retire. He just started a relationship with a woman overseas who’s 30 years his junior and doesn’t speak English, but looks like a promising long-term care taker. There was a strong feeling between us and I still think I might have a chance? Or not?

I have always been an A/B student. I have NEVER in my entire life gotten drunk and or went to a party where there is alchol. I smoked weed twice and didn't really like it. I am very open with my parents. I have had a boyfriend for 3 years now! When I was 17 we became sexually active and I asked my mom about birth control and talked to her about me having sex. I'm very open with my parents though...I have not told them about the whole "pot" thing.    Anyways my parent's still treat me like I'm 6 years old! I guess it's because I'm there only child and they lost there son and almost loss me but it's getting to the point where I cannot take it anymore!!    First let me state that my boyfriend goes to a seperate school then me! I'm not going to my own prom and it tore me apart. It had to do with a few friends backstabbing me. My boyfriend and I decided we would go to    (to be continued)
20070506053921AAWyYIc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anybody offer me some advice?	I think I may have a problem though I'm not sure...      I went through a VERY difficult childhood loosing my brother, being picked on and numerous other things that have went on. I have scars from an "accident" that occurred in 3 places on my body.      Well, I'm going to college next year and I would really like to CHANGE the way I am! But i feel I can't and I was looking for advice as to how to...      Since I was picked on so much at a younger age I've always worried MORE about what other people think about me then what I think of myself! I've always worried about having friends and I have very little confidence in myself! I tend to say mean things about people WITHOUT even realizing I say it. I honestly I don't even remember saying certain things that I say. I am talking to some people VIA the internet that I'm going to college with and I almost feel like I"m telling them to much information but at the same time I don't remember or realize WHAT I'M TELLING THEM!!! It just sort-of "comes out"

I would get so dark and so tan!       Now, I'm 18 and I don't tan at all! I BURN so badly. I was out in the sun for 4 hours with out sunscreen and my shoulders are so burned. I put sunscreen on once i realized i was getting burned but when it peels it doesn't tan it's still white!       how come when i was younger i was able to tan and now i can't?       I'm curious to know if i sit out in the sun every single day will i eventually get as tan as i did when i was younger?      And would a tanning bed help me get tan faster or would i just prob. burn?      I burn VERY easily      help

And I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who do. I was looking at all the old photographs from like 8th grade - junior year of high school. It made me laugh it made me smile and it made me think for a few minutes...Senior year was supposed to be "the year" The year where i take the most photographs, the year where I spend the most time with my friends and laugh and make millions of memories that will never be forgotten! This was supposed to be "the year" but it's really not. There are VERY few photographs and VERY few "events" with friends. I feel like I'm just drifting apart from friends. Not purposely of course...it's just happening and I can't really do anything to control that. I have been spending most of my days with my best friend Lex and or My boyfriend. Aside from that I haven't really hung out with many people. I haven't even really TALKED to many people this year.

20070529183353AAZV0Xk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I tell my parent's and friends?	My boyfriend and I broke up about two weeks ago. During those two weeks I had told my friend all of the horrible things that went on between the two of us. I was just so bitter.      We've now gotten back together. I'm 19 years old and my father has hated EVERY SINGLE GUY I have ever dated and this was no different. He told me that if I went back to him he would disown me and make me find an apartment.      My one close friend whom has had a thing for me for the past 3 years told me that if I chose to go back with my ex he would never speak to me again ever.      I'm not sure if I'm ready to tell people right away that we are dating again. I've been telling people I have a new boyfriend and he has been doing the same by telling people he has a new girlfriend.      I'm just uncomfortable telling people at the moment.    is this a bad thing?   and how do I go about telling people?

Me: Max never cared about me the way you care about your girlfriend.   John: I don't know what Max thought. He is very dumb sometimes    Me: He left me alone the night of my prom.

20070522172539AAGaM0D	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help me!?	I just recently got into a very large fight with my current boyfriend. Some believe he may be very controlling and abusive towards me. The things he has said to me have hurt me very very much. I'm not sure I will ever get over it.    I am trying to get my life back together to where it was a year ago . I am joining a gym and taking kick boxing classes as well as getting council for this relationship and pain i am going through at this moment.    My boyfriend works with me and I am considering quitting my job and starting up somewhere new. Just to give myself a fresh start at things. I'm not sure if this is the best idea though. While I want to turn my life around I love where I work. Regardless if he works with me or not I love my boss's I love the people they are very friendly and I'm not sure I want to give that up for a new job.

My boyfriend and I are really falling apart and I'm not sure if it's time to just move on or time to try and work things out. We've decided as of now we are broken up and have stopped contact with eachother until Sunday. Both of us have said very mean and immature things to eachother and we both need our space. I feel like the relationship has changed due to my "clingingness" towards him. I have quit everything I ever loved doing including my job "somewhat." I only work Tuesday and Thursdays now I call him constantly I text him constantly and I have stopped talking to all my friends. I was involved with 3 different things in my local community and i have stopped doing that as well. I want to put my life back together. I'm going to college next year I want my life back I want our life back to the way it was. Where we spent time with eachother but also did other things!       what should i do?
20070524033102AAclEqL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help if anybody can explain this to me?	My boyfriend and I broke up a week ago. For the past few days I've been begging for him back crying, being sad and being depressed. He finally told me that if I left him alone until Sunday he'd reconsider the relationship.       The things that he has said to me in the past I'd say two weeks are the most hurtful things a man can say to a women and I was shocked to hear it come out of his mouth. I cried for hours upon hours upon hours and days upon days. I felt like I was living a nightmare with the things he told me.       Now, I'm going to see him Sunday and try to work things out but as strange as this sounds I'm not looking forward to it. I'm afraid of it. I'm honestly afraid of him. He said nothing abusive or about hitting me or anything to that sort.       It was more him telling me I was trash and how he was using me for the past year and a half and how I'm nothing more then sex to him. He told me that in order to stay with him I'd have to sleep with him every time we hung out.      i know everyone is going to tell me to "move on" but that's now what my question is. I'd like to know why do you think I'm so afraid of seeing him? Why was I yesterday looking foward to seeing him and now am I so afraid of it?       PLEASE HELP!!!!

20070427222637AAhtSS4	Family & Relationships;Friends	What are some ways to boost my self confidence?	What are some ways that I can be more relaxed, and gain some confidence, particularly in unfamiliar social situations? Lately, I've begun growing apart from my small circle of friends. To make matters worse, I haven't had a date in a VERY long time, and I'm finding myself spending more and more time alone. At first this was ok, but I'm getting wary of trying to find ways to spend spare time by myself. I feel incredibly awkward hanging out in public places alone. It's gotten to the point where I just stay home, to avoid the awkwardness. I know that I won't meet anyone doing this. It is not as easy as just "getting out and making new friends". I'm painfully shy, I have absolutely NOTHING in common w/ my co-workers, and I live in an ***-backward, midwest, town where if you are over the age of 20 and unmarried, you are abnormal. So, any kind of singles scene for someone in their mid-twenties is nonexistant. I just want to make some new friends that I can relate to. Why is this so hard?

Ive been distracting myself with friends during the day, but alone at night all i can think about is how much i miss her, and how id be happier with her than i am now, even though i know it wouldnt work out.. how do i get over her? should i try seeing someone new, or wait a while? does it get easier?

20070510113548AADcFkP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I overreacting?	I have been dating a wonderful man for 9 months.  We have had our share of problems although we respect and admire each other tremendously.  He has unresolved financial issues with his ex-wife, a tenuous relationship with his teenage daughter, and an undecided career path.  I have tried to be patient while he makes strides in these areas (and he has immensely) but now I find myself annoyed with other (smaller?) things.  For instance, when I send him a sexy text message he shares it with others.  I find this disrespectful.  He has done it twice.  Am I being too touchy or is he crossing the line?

I sms her everyday and try to call her twice a week until we will be together again. The thing is that yesterday I sent her 2 sms and didn't get any answer from her. I sent one this evening and didn't get any answer yet...      Last week I asked her if she would be on internet and she said she would but i couldn't make it to be on to chat with her so I don't know if she is holding a little grudge over that :(      I am pretty sure that she is angry since she didn't reply, but I just want to know if you guys have any opinion about that?      Lastly should i call her tonight or leave it till she calls me back?      Loneliness makes people try to find answer here lol   Thanks for your feedbacks guys!

20070320225958AAU60Qg	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do I do if I forgive my friend about something but she won't forgive me?	For a couple months now, my friend and I aren't talking at all. She won't tell me what's wrong with our friendship and she stares at me like I did something wrong but won't say it. Whenever I confront her, she denies anything is wrong and walks away. Lately, things have gotten worse and now another friend of mine has sided with her (she didn't even tell me why). I made 3 attempts to compromise and my last one turned out very badly. I told her let's learn to forgive and move on and I even said sorry for the things that I might have contributed to the cause but I also said that we both did wrong-doings.  I also told her that we just can't hold grudges on each other. She said okay but her tone was like she wouldn't forgive me. Now, both of my friends are siding with each other and I'm the one isolated and rejected. None of them will talk to me and the other classmates still thinks she's a 'nice person'. Is there any hope for this friendship and is this type of isolation harrassment?

I know they say birds of a feather flock together, but this bird wants to fly the coop.  The majority of my closet friends are negative, unhappy and promiscuous.  I will admit that I was that way but I have been changing this past year and I just don't have anything in common with them anymore and I don't know what to do.  Should I just break away completely or just deal with it and hope that they change.  NOTE: They are all more than 5 years older than me.  I am just scared that if I continue to hang around them I will become them.  What to do?  What to do?  What to do?

But now if i say something nice to her she'll just txt back something like: Me too. She wont say the words. Does this mean anything or is it nothing?

20061204151958AAbSluH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I still go for this girl?	Mary and Sue are friends and coworkers. I was pursuing Mary for quite a while but it didnt work out. At the same time, Sue liked me and she knew i was going for Mary. Sue would ask me out, quite a few times. But now after i stopped pursuing Mary, I started to like Sue. I talk to her online daily, flirted with her, to show my attraction towards her and she would do the same. I think she knows I like her now, but isnt really talking to me that much anymore. I havent told her how i felt about her yet. Since she isnt talking that much anymore, i dont feel like i should express my feelings or should I? Is there any hope in saving this relationship? Its her birthday this weekend and im running out of time.

We both got a little drunk and he told me he really liked me, always has! We kissed, cuddled and he even made sure I got home ok in the cab. Later on he text me to say thanks for the best nite of his life, I said lets wait till your sober. He said he didnt need too, he knew how he felt and it wouldnt change. Was just worried incase I changed my mind. Anyway, we got on well after but neither of us mentioned that nite until I was a lil drunk a few days later. He said he meant it when he said he liked me and if things were diff he wud like me to see him as more then jus friends. I said what if I do, he replied with I don't think anything more then friends is a good idea, no matter how we feel about each other. I kinda took that as a brush off, even though we still flirt alot and over a wkend he said he wished I was with him. I don't know what to do anymore. Shud I leave it as mates or talk to him?

20061206171940AAXeRro	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you rekindle a relationship with an ex?	Ok here's my story:  Me and my ex had been talking for six months but were just friends but flirted and i used to say things like "If you weren't *bleeps* friend, you'd be my boyfreind". I met him through a boy I talked to but the boy blew me off and wouldn't call me for a whole month and then decided to come back and thought it was all gravy! As-if!! But that's another story. Anway, we became more than friends and become a couple without actually making it offical. Things were so great it was almost heavenly. But as soon as we made it offical it became awkward. We wouldn't talk all the time like we used to and when we did it was long awkward pauses on the phone. I don't know what happened but we eventually just stopped calling each other. I miss him more than ever. How should approach this?I REALLY NEED HELP!! :(    P.S. I think he has a new girlfriend but I don't know for sure

We never had sex when I dated him long ago.  he lives in my hometown so    dumb me I thought it was cool coincidence that he found me when I just happened to be moving    near him.   Well after a month of iming n talking he mustve been drunk some night n had the bright idea    to email me pictures of him privates.    and then ask me for naked pics back. then he started    asking me if i'd ever like to be tied up, do @nal and be "pretend" raped.

20090225155833AA8cFhd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	RE) I'm a 17 year old guy,vergin, no job, no girlfriend, is there any hope for love?	(sorry accidentally closed my first one) heres a re-cap of my question:   I live in an area, and attend a school, where the only way to fit in is to put others down. and through my life i've promised myself, even if it leaves my alone. i would not hurt people to become popular. i've always been interested in girls too much or too little(being 17). but i find myself now laying in bed at night, lonely. i dream of just being able to find someone i want to talk to, feel warmth, hold, and love.not use for sex. I spend hours wondering to myself if i'll always feel so alone. i am treated like dirt by my friends who look down on me for not swearing or engaging in negative conversation. and still i watch them suffer from abusing drugs, sex. and being involved with violence. my grades slip and i'm barrated by my family for being overweight and a failure. the encourage me to move out. even though i'm turned down job after job. but i've always done my best to be honest and friendly. but my feelings have to remain shut inside. the people here want nothing to do with me. even if i've been treated bad, i cant keep myself from trying to help them. but this lonely pain i'm feeling. is there nothing i can do? these yearnings must be coming from my years of keeping quiet to myself. but the world seems to hate kind people. please, i'm not depressed, and i don't ask for pity. but i have to know. is there any room for nice guys anymore? i don't want to take from anyone. i just have to know. no matter what my outcome will be. i have to remain optimistic.

20090225160009AAWZweK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do in this situation?	Say you gave your girlfriend a card and a gift the evening before valentines day. The next day you try and call her but she does not answer. I knew from the previous evening she was going out with a friend.     You call her the next day and she still don't call you back. When you finally catch up with her she doesn't want anything to do with you.       You confront her and ask her if anything is wrong twice and both times she says "There is nothing wrong." You ask her how her night was with her friend she went out on valentine's with and she turns around and tells you she spent it with another friend who is a guy.       Finally after a few more hours she says did you read the card you gave and and I replied yes. All she said was 2 words "special friend" and stormed out.       I was quite confused then because the card had other stuff in it like "we are close that we are there for one another that we have hard times but work it out", but all she focused was on two words?       Needless to say we haven't said anything to each other since then.   So my question is where do I go from here? My other friend said just to let her be because I already tried to communicate to over come the problem.
20090225160112AAZIjve	Family & Relationships;Family	We don't know what to tell my sisters. How can we answer my their question?	My twin brother and I are 14 and we have two sisters who are 4 (also twins). Our parents aren't home often. Our mother is usually hanging at bars and drinking and our father is doing drugs with his friends. They stay out until about 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning. So my brother and I have to take care of our sister. We have to cook dinner, clean, iron and a lot of other things. Our parents are pretty much deaf to us. We've tried to speak to them repeatedly, but they don't listen to a word either one of us says. Our sisters ask us when Mommy and Daddy are coming and we don't know what to tell them. I couldn't imagine saying to a 4-year-old, "Mommy and Daddy are out doing drugs and drinking alcohol." So we just tell them that our parents are still at work (they both work). But our sisters are starting to realize that Mommy and Daddy aren't working so much. There are times when our parents come home early, but it's rare. Our sisters want another answer, but we don't know what to tell them. Any help here?
20090225160131AAAK3UF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He's confusing me?! Please help.... :(?	So theres this guy, we use to talk. And we use to text constantly. I would always think of silly questions to ask him, and it would start a conversation. But I don't know what happened? We don't even look at each other anymore. I'm not sure if he's mad at me? He's a laid back kind-of guy...so I don't see why he would be mad at me?      I've been trying to find out what I might have done. I remember I accused him of lying to me, like once or twice. But we got over that....      And I'm not sure why we don't talk? He barely text me back, too! Should I apoligize for accusing him? (It happened awhile back, but maybe it would help?)      I'm afraid if I apoligize, maybe he wasn't even mad at me in the first place. And he'll think I say sorry way too much! Ahhh! Should I just ask if he's mad at me?   Or should I be the one to say "hey"?      Please help
20090225160309AADhfXx	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I help my brother?	The thing is we have always been fighting since we were little. He always has a attitude and he always wants everything. We have spanked him in the past. Our father died but before that it was like he only like him for money. He talks back to my mom, my step mother has a better control of him than my mom or me or ANY of my older brothers and sisters have (30+). Anyway, my mother is sick and weak, which is why she can't even hit him anymore. From what I heard from my brothers, sisters, and step mother, they have said that my mom told them she can't hit him because "he hits back" or "he's too strong." But I still believe there is some good in my brother. I want to help him, without calling the authorities but how can I? I have no idea what to do and I'm stuck. Anyone have any alternative actions I could take as his older sister?

20070210185130AAvDV6e	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need guys' opinions on this.?	I have seen this guy around school. When I first walked passed him, I noticed at the corner of my eye that he was staring at me (my face, to be exact.) I looked back at him, and he did not avert his gaze. A couple of days later, I was walking with my friend and telling her about him, then suddenly, he walked passed us! My friend said, "THAT'S HIM?!" sort of loudly, so I'm guessing he probably heard us.      And now, whenever we walk pass each other, I noticed that he'd look straight ahead, then when we're a foot from each other, he'd glance at me for a couple of seconds, then look away. (I saw this at the corner of my eye)      Does he think I like and stalk him? (which I don't!)   Does he think I'm attractive?   What exactly is he thinking?   Next time, should I maintain eye contact and smile?      We don't know each other at all, if that helps.

20070221204547AAUcrcT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If he was interested, would he have acted differently? Did I jump too quickly to mention hanging out?	Okay, so again I feel I'm reminded why I've given up on guys completely. Here is some feedback I've heard about myself. Basically, I appear to be intimidating and hard to approach which is why most guys don't really approach me. According to people I know, they are shocked I don't have a boyfriend or any "love interests" because any guy in his right mind would want to date me. Anyway, that all aside, here is the actual story.       A new guy started working at my job. He seems kind of quiet and reserved. I kind of took a liking to him right away because he's kind of cute in a different kind of way, not like your typical "male model" or actor good looks. One of my friends/co workers said to me "Wow I'm surprised you think he's cute, you seem too good for him" but I didn't necessarily think so. Well I worked with him a couple times and we talked a little bit and turns out we go to the same college. So I decided to myspace message him the other day and basically say "hey what's up" and I suggested we meet up on campus one day. He basically responded friendly but yet not really so much. He said a couple things in response to what I had said and then was like "I don't really have any breaks in between classes, but we could prob meet up sometime" and we continued to message eachother back and forth about work and everything and then once the conversation dwindled, he said he was going to go to bed. So basically, we talked, sure, but he didn't go out of his way to pursue it. We made no set plans, we didn't exchange numbers. Now I guess I didn't necessarily make it seem any more than a friendly thing, but I'm sure he could have taken a hint a little bit, right? I mean, I've been at my job forever so I try to make all the new people feel welcome.. and I know he doesn't have a girlfriend, though he may have someone, just nothing official or serious...          So what do we think here?

Then he started singing Cupid's Chokehold and putting his arm around me and pointing at me during that one verse we all know. He whistled at me in the hallway and was saying I smelled nice or something. Do you think he likes me or he's just teasing me? He does a ton of other "flattering things" that make me think and think a little more

I know it depends on the individual, but I need to know what you think and your reason as to why. Specifically, I need an answer from an asian guy... but it'd be nice to here from everybody. When you look for a girlfriend, is it "looks over personality" or is it "personality over looks"? Please, no "both" answers. I know it sounds cruel but it's not possible to feel the same for both. You can go for both personality and looks but you have to favor one at least a tiny bit more than the other.

20070415003123AAhkCWy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do men give "ugly" women dirty looks?	Like everyone else, I have a handful of men and women who love and adore me for my many qualities, as well as a handful of men and women who would rather run me over with a cement truck for my many faults. In regards to the latter of the two groups, I've come to realize that while I'm not being gawked at and winked to by those who enjoy my presence, I'm sometimes picking up on grimaces or rolls of the eyes by both men and women who, while they normally don't know me personally, would prefer not to look at me either. But I've noticed that it's mostly men who do this. So my question is ... why do men give women they deem unattractive dirty looks? Literally looks that could kill, as though they are insulted by being within 10 ft of someone who doesn't meet their testicular quota? I don't frown upon "ugly" men - frankly, I don't truly care about someone's looks when they don't directly affect my life, like many others. But men who are rude, blunt, snippy and nasty towards the "uglies"??

I would be devistated if he did.They wont let me see him, because he is black, and comes from "the wrong side of the tracks" as they say.They said he could never give me anything, because he is always getting suspended, and doesnt have alot of money. He raps though, I think he might be famous one day ;)...Alot of his friends think I am snobby because im wealthy, but that is not true @ all.This is really bothering me. I have tried talking with them, but they will never change.   So, what do I do. Do I go see him behind my parents back & risk getting in serious trouble, or tell him I dont think its going to work out?

Know that he now has good doctors, he refuses a home, can't drink, can't have cat, and he has enough money but he won't pay, he wouldn't pay 550.00 at first but where can you rent that cheap, we make sure the heat is hot enough, tv loud enough, he just sits, he is in a terrible situation, I am fully aware, but it is also my husbands father. This is the last place he can live, he has nobody else he can rely on to live. THought moving his 5th wheeler here at least he would be familiar, but what if he falls, can't find phone, bottom line he just wants the booze, when sister in law was gone last time, he came here two times, hubby took him shopping bought booze, and he even drank sister in law taquilla, but he remained drunk. Chili in pan never eatten, come on, I know he is a elder but who is going to get the balls and bottom line it. Anyone that goes toe to toe he takes out of will, hubby sez give me 7 mo. he will do the same to me, and he doesn't care.......I know I ride a fine line. plz
20070418203412AAIXm2V	Family & Relationships;Family	Parents are stressing me out!!!?	My mom is stressing me out so much and my dad isn't necessarily helping. School is ending soon and I need to move out of the dorms and move into an apartment. I can't be at home for 3 months, going home for the weekend is stressful as everything seems to be my fault if I clean the house wrong or sit down for a little bit. Even over Spring Break I lost 4 pounds...in one week because of said stress. I cannot afford to live in an apartment without my parents' help, however they won't let me get an apartment right after school. Why? Because they don't want to pay for more rent, even if I get a job I can't afford the apartment and I can't stay at home. I don't know what to do. My parent's aren't being understanding about getting an apartment because they want me to move in a week before school starts... How should I get over the stress and the problems?

20070420161016AA2WYDN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do about this?	There is this guy who is a friend of mine. Three years ago  me and this guy goofed off. During the time we were goofing off I found out he had a girlfriend so i called everything off. Each fair since that year we have flirted. Last year was the first year nothing has happened. Now him and his girlfriend are split and having rough times. i stayed out of this relationship but somehow I always get pulled into his relationships. This week   we had to do some stuff for fair and It started again. Fair is coming up and to tell you the truth I'm scared I know what is going on and I know are past. I do like this guy but I'm also his friend who cares about him and if he like his girlfriend now I don't want to be the reason they are broken up. Me and this guy have a lot of chemistry that something could happen between us. I guess I just don't know what to do. Could you guys please help me? Any information you could give me would be great. Thank you!

20070519125918AAOvT19	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When is it "ok" for teen couples to sleep together?	My girlfriend and I are 16 and 17 respectively. We have been together for nearly a year now and are engaged. We love each other very much. We are sexually active and both our parents are aware of that and are ok with it. However, when we ask to sleep with each other rather then sleeping in separate beds we always get a no. We don’t want to sleep together because we want to have sex all night! We want to share the intimacy of being close to each other and waking up together. On holidays and trips our parents allow it but not at home.      We wouldn’t ask our parents if we didn’t feel we were serious enough. Is it fair for us to ask this of our parents? Should our parents let us as long as our relationship is a mature one? When is it okay?

He is my father’s son and chose not to contact my father for twenty nine years. He finally was curious and called him and they met. My father is not a deadbeat dad, both he and my half brother’s mother were married and both decided that it was best to allow my brother to decide when he wanted to meet my father. My parents asked my opinion and I am not sure what answer to give them. What should they leave my half brother in their wills? He is not my mother’s son so should he get an equal share of everything that they have worked for? Their estate will not be huge, but substantial, and they don’t want to give anyone the shaft. They want to be fair to all of us, including him. Despite the fact that he wasn't part of the family his entire life, he is now. There are two other siblings. I do not begrudge him anything, but I am curious about others opinions.

He doesn't msg me that much and I am starting to feel neglected.  So I told him and he apologised and said he didn't realise.  He is now seeing me more and messaging heaps.      He planned a day at the beach for us next sunday, but 2nite he told me that his brother n someone else wants to come.  I didn't say anything, but i was kind of annoyed.   We always have 'alone time' so it shouldn't really be a big deal.. I would just rather have it just me and him.      Am i being clingy?  Or do you have to be more psychotic than this in order to be classed as possessive?

He has a girlfriend, but he accused me of sleeping with another co-worker. He even told the guy "You can have her." like I was his to toss away. Then I grabbed his arm and said I wasn't sleeping with anyone. I said "Look at who you are sleeping with!"       So why would he even bring it up? Why would he care? I am not even interested in that guy. I'm interested in someone else. And I told him about that guy. I kissed the one I'm interested in.

And I am not one that is fearful...Is asking for some empathy and understanding...or even a bit of attention too much. Can't real men just be tender occasionally when their spouse needs it.

20070604222706AAVugwo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What are the chances of getting him back?	I am going to tell my ex boyfriend that I want to get back together, but I do not want to sound desperate in case he does not feel the same. But here are some signs I think he might still have feelings for me.       He tells me I mean a lot to him. I was rather surprised to hear that as I was the one breaking up with him and I had no idea I still meant that much to him.      He still compliments me, telling me that I was perfect. The other day I told him I felt better after working out and he was like how could you be better when you were perfect then. And he also says any man who marries me would be very very lucky.      And he took time off work just to meet me up and buy me dinner in a nice restaurant when I was on a business trip near where he lives. ( He had to fly an hour and a half to be able to see me)      We flirt a lot too      So does it sound like he still likes me a lot? And what are the chances of getting him back.

I don't wanna do the usual "its not you its me" or the "im not ready for a relationship" whats something thats more legit but won't leave her hanging?

20070608205517AAsmoAj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Naughty question?	Just kidding...i want to know your opinion...on this girl...did she use me?      1. She'd just broken up with the boyfriend she'd been going out with for 2 years...she was crushed. i asked her out like 3 days later. She said yes.      2. She frequently talked with her ex. He asked if "He was making me jealous." She had no comment.      3. At the other end of the lunch table was where her ex sat. She listened in on his conversations and interrupted him. In a flirty kinda way.      4. She said to her friend "I'm thinkin about goin out with Austin [her ex] again."      5. She said she needed me as a friend.      that was it...   would it be wrong to accuse her of using me???      P.S. There was one point when one of her friends was seeming to like her ex. She said it was wrong because "Friends don't date friends' exes...two weeks after she dumped me her friend asked me out and she had no problems...   thanks for the input...

20080106172516AAie508	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you find this depressing?	You've known someone since birth, and they've been a GREAT kid--fun to be around, very funny, loved to talk and laugh...   Recently, you start liking the person. A lot, actually. Even though you've never actually talked to them, you knew their personality, what they looked like...and you just liked the person they were. You haven't seen the person in a few years though, but recently went to a party of theirs, and their personality changed, looks changed...all for the worse. They're not the same person they used to be. And the worst part is, you've had feelings for them even though you've been unable to talk to them, ever.   Of course, you might not even like them anymore, but would this disappoint you?      It certainly disappointed me. Especially since it's a family friend we're talking about here.

We talk and have fun chats here and there and we are jokingly "engaged", but the scary part is I think I am starting to like her. I am fine with that, but recently she was sick so I didnt talk to her much and she doesnt respond her IMs a lot anymore since she got better and we havent really talked much, but I kinda seem a lil needy by asking her where she is sometimes. She told me that she doesnt really like how I am not really myself aronud her and she thinks Im a player and even though I tell her the truth, it still comes out like I am a player to her. She thinks Im smooth too but she talks to some guys too as friends and it kinda makes me feel a bit scared. We arent going out or anything, but I like her now but we just turned friends and she isnt more popular than me or anything, we hang around different groups, but we just arent the same. wut do I do?

Desde hace tiempo estoy solo y no es por gusto sino porque mi trabajo me absorbe mucho tiempo y en ocasiones no me da tiempo de salir a divertirme. Pero creo que ha llegado el momento de sentar cabeza y de buscar una compa?era con quien salir a divertirme, con quien me sienta feliz y vivir mi vida a su lado. No busco un estereotipo de mujer como las que salen en la tele, delgadas y hermosas; mas bien busco alguien que sea sincera, detallista,amorosa y fiel para entregarle todo este amor que tengo dentro y que he guardado por mucho tiempo. El fisico no me interesa mucho, mas bien busco a una mujer linda y hermosa de sentimientos, porque yo siempre he pensado que el fisico se acaba y los sentimientos no y mas si sabes cuidarlos y cultivarlos dia a dia.

20070628221212AAwrVgK	Family & Relationships;Family	?Que piensan los padres que se divorcian, respecto a lo que sienten los hijos?	Muchas veces me he preguntado esto. ?Qué sucede con los hijos? Los padres generalmente comienzan "una vida nueva". Cada uno busca sus respectivas parejas y son felices.    Un padre que vive en una casa y una madre que vive EN OTRA casa. Papá tiene más hijos, mami también tiene más hijos. Papá tiene otras responsabilidades, mami también. ?"Ellos tienen derecho a buscar su felicidad"!. ?Y qué pasó con la familia A LA QUE TENIA DERECHO ESE NI?O?

20070703093057AAzmQSQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When is the right time to tell someone your moving on?? Cuz I gotta get this off of my mind!?	I just spoke to this guy yesterday and told him how I felt, and you can read what I told him in my previous question if you want. He said he doesn’t know what hes goin to do about his feelings, but he really likes me. Then as the conversation kept goin he asked me what im doin with my life. I replied get my AA, get into modeling/photography and use that money for bills and to then earn my BA in business. I asked him and he said he don’t know. He just quit his job as a manager at circuit city, moved out of his OWN apartment and moved in with a buddy of his. Then I asked him what hes doing for the 4th of july…he said nothing right now…so I asked…Did you wanna hang out for a lil bit while im in town. He replied “Well I got to figure out what Im doing first.” Haha what?? I said. “you just said nothing right now…so that makes me last priority??” he said no its not like that just…” then I changed the subject and said I gotta go back to work and hung up.
20070618084743AAkTxDf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	People say we're still in the "puppy love" stage...?	But personally I don't see the way I feel about her changing anytime soon. I see couples that get bored with one another, but her and I are like best friends first and a couple second. I'm always thinking about her, thinking of fun things to do, and my PRIME goal is to just keep her happy doing those little things for her; flowers for no reason, back scratches, all that stuff. It's been 6 months and we love each other.      Am I delusional that we won't get to that bored state, or are others just not happy and trying to downplay how happy we are together???

When I'm lost in the rain,   In your eyes I know I'll find the light to light my way.   And when I'm scared and losing ground;   When my world is going crazy, you can turn it all around.     And when I'm down you're there; pushing me to the top.   You're always there; giving me all you've got.     For a shield from the storm;   For a friend; for a love   To keep me safe and warm,   I turn to you.   For the strength to be strong;   For the will to carry on;   For everything you do;   For everything that's true,   I turn to you.     When I lose my will to win,   I just reach for you and I can reach the sky again.   I can do anything,   'Cause your love is so amazing; 'cause your love inspires me.     And when I need a friend, you're always on my side;   Giving me faith that gets me through the night.     For a shield from the storm;   For a friend; for a love   To keep me safe and warm,   I turn to you.   For the strength to be strong;   For the will to carry on;   For everything you do;

20070713095113AAb33h0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me? (Boys' answers really appreciated!!!)?	There is a guy at school and last summer I realised I had fallen in love with him The thing is that he didn't seem to like me ('cause athough we knew each other he didn't even say "hi") until this year when he started doing strange things like:      - calling me with a nickname   - staring at me and sometimes pretending to look at sth else   -touching me (hand greeting me and once put his hand round my waist)   -looking annoyed when I talked to other boys   - asking me questions about me and looking completely interested and absorbed when we had a conversation   - talking a LOT (without a specific reason) when around me (probably trying to hide he was nervous) and sometimes used my name (the real one) and I thought he did it in order to get my attention.      My problem is that when all these started, he had a girlfriend (with whom he seemed to be in love) and then he broke up with her and the same day found another one.( but they seem VERY distant)      Do you think he is seriously interested?

20070925151205AAql8ob	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My friend likes the same girl I like.....?	Well I'm 14 and I'm a freshman at my Highschool this year. Theres this girl who is only in my english class I find quite attractive and I want to get to know her by being friends w/ her and see if I'm completely interested since I don't wanna ask her out she says yes and I find out shes a whore.(though I highly doubt she is)   Now my orginal plan was anytime I'd see her in the halls I'd simply say a "hi" or maybe I migh of asked "what was the homework"   Now I have the courage to do it but theres one problem in my way.   I rarely ever see in the day with the exception of English in the morning.   Now recently when walking to my next class I'd always be looking around to see if she'd be bearby on my route for future reference.   I now have a pretty good idea of a few places during the day I might see her.   Now my other problem is that I'm not the only one interested in her.   In my English class a sorta friend of mine Joe(fake name) likes Samantha(fake name) too.   And unfortanetly  I revealed to him that I like her to becaues he was mentioning her one time and I agreed that I might try to get with her.   Now today he asked me to ask Sam if she has a boyfriend.   Of course it would be a good idea to find out if she has one now so I don't get shot down quicky later.   I'm really not sure if I should ask her because she might suspet that its me who wants to know.   If she doesn't suspect that she might know its Joe because he's about one of the only guys I talk to in that class and Joe doesn't have any classes with her.   Now I can't decide whether or not to ask her if she has a boyfriend because currently I barely exist to her and I'm not to sure if it would be a good idea to start with that question.   Joe asked me to lie to her saying a name of another guy but there's no way I would lie to her.   Please help me LI what do I do.   NOTE: I'm in the process of fixng grammar errors and other mistakes so plz hold the critcism
20070706093646AA5xUVo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't seem to talk comfortably with my boyfriends mom!?	I've been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half. we met while going to school two years ago. I'm somewhat of a shy person when i first meet people, but after i hang out with them for a while i open up and people end up liking me, it just takes time. the problem is is that i see my boyfriends parents maybe twice during the school year, and every three weeks or so during the summer due to the distance between us. I'm not at all comfortable around his mom. i feel that she doesn't like me, even though i know she does. I'm fine talking with her while my boyfriend is in the room, but if he leaves for a bit i just sit there silently, not knowing what to say. i just can't seem to get past this. i feel that it's been so long that i can't change it. she's even asked my boyfriend in private why i don't talk to her. i don't know how to fix this. I'm intimidated by her  (I'm fine talking to his step dad) and i feel it's been going on too long to change. any suggestions or anyone like this?

Here goes. A friend of mine, who happens to be a girl, and also happens to be a friend of the girl of my dreams, is angry at me. Now, I know why she's angry at me. Why? Because I did something so bad. What did I do? I told the guy that she really likes that she likes him. Sounds simple? I'll trade places with anyone who says it's that simple. Now, she won't talk to me. I've tried in vain to apologize (thru y!m), but she doesn't want to listen. I even offered to do anything just for her to forgive me, and she said there was something I could do. What could I do? Just don't talk to her. Oooooooooooooh, man... Please, what should I do? It's really tearing me apart because I'm not the type of person who can live w/ someone being angry at me. Please help me. I really need serious answers. Thanks, and God Bless. :)

I loved teaching and kids, and the latter liked me very much, too. Now, I feel kinda aimless. It's not my job.......I really like what I'm doing.

My family is partly to blame, too. They aren't doing very well financially, and when I try to have fun I'm afraid that I'll look selfish.   I cry all the time. I just don't know what to do. And, yes, I pray. When I pray, I realize that I'm better off than most others and have a lot of be grateful about, but then I cry.

He called my son last night and left a message saying hello and telling him he was in CA.   Why is he choosing now to contact him?  We use to travel often but this sounds like he is starting to travel for work again.  I always loved that part of our relationship.  We loved to travel.      Second part of storey.  I met this guy through a dating service around a month ago.  We moved in together after about 2 1/2 weeks.  He had this trip planned for a week in VA. with his two college aged daughters.  Well he is there now. I don't mind that he has taken this planned vacation.  I am from Florida.  I told him that I needed a short vacation there alone to clear my head.  He told me that it was not going to happen.  This sounds controlling to me.  I will take any time at home that I feel I need.

20070629021620AA9NCcR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Por qué a veces nos enamoramos tan rapido?	A veces me sorprende como la gente dice estar enamorada casi de la noche a la ma?ana, pasan de no estar con nadie a depender totalmente de la otra persona y no parar de pensar en el/ella Me parece sorprendente porque apenas la/o conocen y ya quieren pasar todos los dias a su lado y a veces hasta dejan de lado a los amigos para irse con el/ella cuando a los amigos se supone que los deberian de querer mas porque han pasado mas momentos con ellos.   El caso, esque  muchas veces, de estar solo se conoce a una persona de un dia para otro y no se piensa en otra cosa   Creeis que es enamorarse tan rapido? que yo creo que es imposible porque apenas se conoce a la persona o simplemente es necesidad de cari?o, de ser valorado por alguien, ilusion de la posibilidad de hacer un futuro con esa persona, ausencia ya de soledad,atraccion fisica,emocion porque alguien nos comprende y le importamos.eso se puede unir al miedo de perder esas cosas y por eso se depende tan rapido del otro?creeis que es amor?

He always said I was to good to be true but now he wants to get serious with me and he has shown me he is changing- it's like he's had a revelation and he is sick of living the way he was.  This man is wonderful in a TON of ways but shouldn't I be concerned he will cheat on me eventually?  Is it possible he can change?  He is almost 40.  Not bragging but I am a great catch,that,  I know I am.  It's just hard to find someone to get along with and we really enjoy each other and have lots in common.  I have been playing really hard to get now because he has lost my trust due to the past BS with him.  Any opinions?  Should I lose him altogether or keep him around until he proves himself?  Whose to say he won't cheat in a year from now-you know???

20071109120649AAQsLSG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	For guys ... Why do you do this?	And if You have done this before... dont do it again b/c it hurts.    So why do you tell a girl one day how you have feelings for her, and do all of the right things and say all the right things to catch her attention  (i.e. call  to her ever day of the week. for 2-3 weeks) Then just when the girl starts getting into you...you stop calling and stop responding except when you have to be polite. And it's obvious that's what you are doing.      if you decide the next day that you really dont want to take the relationship further after leading a girl to believe that you are really into her,  Why cant you just confess and let the girl know so that She doesnt make a fool out of her self calling you or getting mad?  Better yet so that she can move on with her life.    Why do guys leave girls hanging like that?

I know this does not pertain to the singles and dating section and I hope nobody gets angry with me for asking this question here but I really do need some help!       Back in August of 2006 my 2 year contract with Verizon Wireless had expired. I decided to purchase a new phone. I purchased an L.G. vx5200 phone which I had accidentally broken. I had to pay full price for another phone. I purchased the LG 8300 phone. A lot of people have said great things about that phone but for me it was a nightmare! I had 4 phones of the same kind and they ALL broke! Finally I made a big enough stink and they gave me a phone of half the price value I payed for the lg phone. Mind you I payed FULL PRICE for this phone! I had 4 of them and all 4 of them were defective! They gave me a Samsung A-930 for free in replace of it. Mind you the Samsung was priced a lot cheaper then my phone and what I had payed for my phone. About $100.00 cheaper    (continued below)

20080126181707AAZPrum	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy Troubles: Need Other Opinions on My Situation?	A "Cowboy" who had been smiling at me for weeks at a local bar finally asked me to dance.We ended up talking all night, going back to his place & making out (no sex). He took me out the next night (went good, more kissing) &asked me to go out again on his next day off (he works crazy hours on a ranch all week).But, on his day off he chose to go for drinks with his buddies(I played it cool)! I called him the next night to invite him to a bbq. He never called me back!5 days later, hadn't heard from him&was worried(he has a dangerous job) so I sent a text-how are u? No reply. Then last night I went out to our bar with another guy ("Cowboy2"). Cowboy1 showed up & rambled about being SO busy. I was polite but kept my distance out of respect for my date & b/c I was ticked. Cowboy1 also kept a respectful distance- he and Cowboy2 are casual friends (hang w/same cowboy crowd), but stared at us most of the night (which Cowboy2 comented upon) as we danced, laughed & had a good time (Continued)

20080105111951AAlXrF0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can you tell if a male friend truly wants to be your friend?	Forget about the When Harry Met Sally bit.  I have male friends that are attractive inside and out but there may be reasons I haven't explored that area or would want to.  It's not that they're not good enough, just not compatitble for whatever reason.  It's sad to think that a woman always has to wonder if a guy is just waiting to go to bed with her and everything inbetween is a pleasant exchange of words and false pretenses therein.      Is there a sure-fire way to see this coming on before you get close to anyone?  I'd ask about women too, but that's another question all-together.

20070730030245AAmiixD	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	A question for anyone that is confussed or maybe able to give a good response to this?	Why is it that most men now days seem to take off when or just before they find out the girl is pregnant? The guy I was with was sitting there talking bout he couldnt wait tell the day that we where married and had our own place and I was pregnant with his kid and all of a sudden he said it was over I found out a few weeks later that I was pregnant and now all he does is deny the fact that it is his. Now I am being told that his family is going to have a DNA test done and if it is his then he is going for custody of the kid. I dont understand it he didnt want nothing to do with it for 9 months and now he does its weird and fucked up. The even worse part of that is he thinks that there is no way in h*** thathe wont get custody of the kid just because of the fact that I have eplepsy. But I think the main reason he is doing it now is cause of the fact that I am now engaged to someone his family dont like.

20070605184302AAFYRA6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i tell him how i feel about him?	I really like this guy that i have known for years, the problem is i dated his uncle briefly. Nothing ever came out of the relationship with his uncle. We went to lunch once. We had some phone conversations and he may have visited my home 4 or 5 times.  We are strictly friends w/o the benefits. When i first met the nephew, he was in a committed relationship so i didn't approach him. But now he is single again. He knows about my friendship with his uncle. I have known this guy for some time and i know that he is a hard working, dependable guy.(Something that you don't see much of in my town). I really feel that this could be a good match for me but i also feel guilty that i dated his uncle.This dilemma has bothered me for days now. I am not the type of person that approaches a guy but i feel if i don't take this chance i will lose what could possibly be the chance of a lifetime for happiness.

You never talked to her before.   3. She doesn't know who you are.   4. None of your friends are any of her friends.       Problem-You want to date her. If not that be friends with her.

20070611213213AAIGPE7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Kicked to the curb?	Been dating this woman (she's 43) for two months now.  At first I wasn't that interested, but she kept pursuing, and I did become very interested.  Saw each other two/three nights a week as well as Friday/Saturday nights, spending those nights together.  She always told me how hard it was to see me go after a night together.  When she was sick I took care of her on her birthday I she told me how that totally made her day extra special.  With that said I knew her kids were coming for the summer, and wouldn't get much time over the summer to see her.  She claims that no one she dates meets her kids and when she is with her kids she is with her kids.  Well kids are here now and I haven't heard a word from her, acutally started before the kids even got here.  She won't return a phone call/email/text message nothing for a couple of weeks now.  When I went by her office the receptionist said she was in a meeting , but she would tell her I came bye.  How hard have I been kicked?

20070612173811AARmJTb	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My boyfriend is moving away? Very far away and I don't know how to cope?	I've been with him for over a year and he's moving to Texas. (we currently both live in New York) Well it's real difficult for me. We fought a lot and it seems like this would be better. We also both didn't see the relationship working out later on. But all this doesn't seem right. I've practically revolved my life around him. He isn't my life although a part of it and I honestly can't picture him not being here, regardless if he was my boyfriend or not. I have my highest opinions of him. I just don't know how to cope with this. I don't know if I should see him anymore or talk to him because I don't want to grow my feelings for him when he's going to leave me a month later. I don't know how to act around him and how to get back on in my life without having to act like I'm an angry and miserable person. That's not how I used to be. Help me.

One of my guy friends and I used to be going out and I broke up with him but I never could quite seem to get him off my mind so I asked him out. He keeps playing 'hard to get'. I asked him out about three months ago and he never answered. In my yearbook he wrote that he loved me but he will just have these days where he could care less about me. It bugs me because I can't tell what he really feels. I call him sometimes and we will talk for hours one night and the next night he will just blow me off. I can't keep my mind off of him. I am a teenager but I need help! Anybody have any advice for me? Anything would be helpful.

20070616005846AAhM12G	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My guy friend is acting distant.?	I've been friends with this guy for about a year now. I'm pretty sure he had a crush on me at first, but we ended up being "just friends". Our friends even joke and say we're like bro. and sis. However, at a recent party he started acting very flirty. We were all sober, by the way. He rested his head on me and even admitted he wanted to kiss me but wasn't sure about it. I told him I was confused about it and he agreed he was too. The whole week after that night, he barely said 2 words to me. He invited me to his party and said "come if you want" and he still isn't talking to me at all. He says "cool" and "idk"... I don't want to go now becuase I'm not sure that he actually wants me there. I think I like him, a lot actually. I really care about him. I finally asked him if he was upset and he made it clear that he wants a girlfriend. I'm scared to admit that I like him incase he doesn't feel the same way. Ever since that night, he is different. Should I go to his party or give him space?

20070618005351AALAtNF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies help im so confused ... plz my heart is confused?	ok fast details i dated this woman for a few months and the best freaking months ever. She left for an ex that i knew was still in the picture when we got together. Now they are done/over all that. The only thing i asked through it all is that she may give up on love but not give up on the idea of us. She agreed. Well we are the best of friends and have been since we met. Now she has found her way into another mans arms. She says that i mean so much to her and that the reason she is with this guy/( supposedly it is just sexual she says and she foprgets about him once they are apart) but that the reason shes not with me like that is because she knows feelings will resurface if we were to get together.. She says that he seems lonely . AM i stuck in the friend zone forever, which would be kill  my heart or perhaps she is honest and all. I know i dont need her or want her in a matter of speaking. it is just that my life is so much better with her there as my partner. she is my sunshine.

My question is if this girl looks out of the very corner of her eyes at me during class, sits with me and goes over the test results after the test, ask questions about family and career plans. She stays nervous, poping pins, playing with her hair and stuff.To the shy questions:   This girl the other day,  started reading my paper for class, and made a comment on something wrong I did. I have asked her to study with me twice, but she was busy. When she is called on in class. she will look over at me blushing, as she states her answer. I do not know if this is related to her interest, but when the teacher asked her why she was in college, she omething about supporting herself looking at me.      Could these be interest signs. Could the age difference, be why she is saying no to studying. I really like this girl, but do not want to look bad if she does not feel the same. PLEASE HELP ME HERE!!!

Hola, hace unos 3 meses decidimos tomarnos un tiempo con mi novia ya que veniamos sintiendonos mal desde hacia un tiempo. Estuvimos 10 a?os de novios y no se si por rutina o que, decidimos separarnos por un tiempo.   Sinceramente la extra?aba un monton pero no nos veiamos para cumplir ese tiempo que habiamos pactado.. ahora que me he dado cuenta que la amo como a nadie no se que hacer para volver a estar juntos. Ella me dice que le costo la separacion pero que ahora esta bien y que me quiere un monton. Dice que es un tema de sentimientos pero se que todavia algo tenemos y que seguramente por miedo o el dolor que pasamos teme volver a caer en lo mismo. Yo quiero volver y quisiera hacer lo imposible por convencerla de que no podemos dejar atras la relacion por miedos... yo creo q en este tiempo tratamos de aceptar el corte y ahora es complicado volver a confiar. Por mi parte, se que puede funcionar, pero no se como hacer para q crea en mi y apueste por lo bueno que tuvimos.Q puedo hacer?

Basically, we just randomly talk online every once in a while, and I know that he just considers me an internet buddy. I don't really get to see him since we're in different schools. I think I like him, but I'm pretty sure he doesn't like me as anything more than just a random girl online. He's waaaay out of my league, and he has girls falling all over him, so I know I should just stop with the random IM messages. Usually, I wait for him to IM me first, but when he doesn't and signs off, I kind of feel rejected. I know it's really stupid. Can anyone offer me any kind of advice on what the hell I should do with about my damn crush?    PS. please keep in mind that I know that he's way out of my league and he doesn't find me attractive, the way he does other girls.

I feel so alone, I've dealt with depression,suicidal thoughts,VERY low self-esteem,ocd and crazy fights with my mom for 4 yrs, but I'm on meds, seeing a therapist and I finally feel like my life is back on track.

20070625183720AAQnufn	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I try to find my father?	I am 16 and the last time I saw my dad was when I was around 7. He and my mom never got married and he lived in another state so I saw him like once every year or two. He was nice from what I remember and he always gave me a present when I went to see him, which I remember really liking as a child. I think that I miss him and I find myself sometimes having crushes on older men when I think they just act like a father figure. I would also like to know what I need to watch out for genetically because I know he was overwieght and I think his mother had heart problems. I do think though that he might of lost contact because maybe he did not want a daughter and I respect that and don't want to bug him. Should I try to find him and can anyone tell me a way how (my mom said he was a very private person and had a private phone number and all that)???

Conoci hace tiempo a una persona, pero la deje de ver por cuestiones que no vienen al caso, poco tiempo despues me entero que aun anda por ahi, esa persona aun me considera su amiga, sin embargo no se si dar el paso o no, tristemente creo que me oculta cosas y que solo me quiere como "amiga", quiza como soporte en sus penas, pero hasta ahi... ?como le hago para que se entere que existo? ?valdra la pena buscar una relacion en una amistad la cual no es profunda ni ha sido duradera?
20070629003826AA21rt4	Family & Relationships;Friends	Que puedo acosejarle a un amigo en problemas?	Un amigo mio tiene una novia que esta estudiando en Portugal, la cosa es que el se quedo algo angustiado porque quiza la novia pueda coronarlo estando alla sola, el confia en ella, pero nosotras conocemos a la chica en cuestion desde antes y pues no tiene un pasado turbio, pero tampoco es tan "inocente", ahora ademas le ha llamado para pedirle ayuda economica, porque salio mal en unos examenes y le retiraron media beca. Dice que si sus padres se enteran la matan por lo cual le pidio que le enviara el dinero a nombre de una amiga de la Uni, mi amigo tiene Dinero para mandarle, pero tiene sus sospechas... ?que harian?, ?que le dirian en mi lugar?
20070629010142AAM0B2P	Family & Relationships;Family	Que deberia hacer yo????	Resulta ser que un familiar (chico) llevaba 4 a?os con su novia hace dos meses ella se quedo embarazada de el pero ella empezo a mantener relaciones con un compa?ero de trabajo, su novio lo descubrio pero ella lo negaba, provocaba peleas con su novio hasta que decidio marcharse de casa, hace dos semanas, la familia pensamos que era para irse a vivir con su amante a todo esto hay que decir que ella aborto sin consultarselo a su novio, ahora hace solo una semana ella a vuelto con su novio, creemos que porque el amante no queria irse a vivir con ella.   Su novio ha aceptado volver con ella, el ha abandonado parcialente su trabajo por estar con ella, y le concede todos los caprichos gastando ella el dinero de el pero ya estando con el ella volvio a ver a su amante desde entonces no ha quedado con el y ella esta semana a dejado el trabajo.   Todos vemos que ella no le quiere y le esta sacando el dinero y el en cambio esta muy enamorado. Como podemos hacerle ver a el que se esta equivocando???

20070705032946AAzHiMg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is love real?	Wouldn't you say "love" at its core is really just survival tactics? We use people to gain escape from the horrors of this reality and provide ourselves with a shield of personal ecstasy? To me it seems so obvious, and it's surprising others don't see it that way. We're really just looking for the best candidates to survive with and reproduce. LADIES: No matter how much you "love" your boyfriend, if Brad Pitt or a major powerful / famous person came by you'd dump him in a second. Am I wrong? Give me your views.

And i wanted to but she's going to high school next year and I'm staying in middle school. So i told her yes, but what about after the summer. And then i asked this IS a joke right. And she said ha yeah, my friend was paying me 5 bucks. Its all his fault. I'm not really mad. I'm just kinda embarrassed.

20070706120029AAJXb5G	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is the right thing to do?	Hi There, I met this amazing man last week, we have worked in the same place for years but not aquainted, we met at a work party on Friday and really clicked, ended up snogging all night.  It was lovely.  I e -mailed him on monday, just a brief thanks for a good night etc.  now i'm worried I may have given him the brush off, I saw him yesterday we chatted briefly as he was rushing off.  I really like him and want to see him again, how can I let him know without the potential rejection making things at work difficult? Should i just ask him outright?

20070709163543AAjQF8d	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I call him? Guys, when you need space, you really need space or just don't like girls?	Here is the story. I met the guy through a very well known dating website. He gave me impression as a nice guy so we met. After the first date, we met several times. He tries to call me but he is very hard working and his call is always very short because he is tired. Anyway this is what he says and i think he is saying the truth. This has been 5 weeks or so. Suddenly he is starting to reduce his frequency of call. My question is I don't know what to do. Even if I ask he would say because he is busy or something. I don't know if i should keep questioning or if i do it will scare him away  or if he is a guy that will be scared away by this, maybe he is not that worthy?    My guess is that he is feeling that i'm too demanding maybe because i have been asking him to see me on his day off , which on our las phonecall, he rejected, because he had to go to take care of his car repair which has been dated 3 years. I don't know if he just doesn't like me or if i'm pushing him too hard ..
20070710083327AAIk54B	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He left me out of nowhere?	We've been together almost 5 yrs. & lately he has been popping pills along with his anti-depressants and I've noticed his downfall of course we talked about it and I thought things were o.k but something happened at work to set him off he walked out and left a note for his friend saying he was sorry and that when he came back he wouldn't have a job, house or girlfriend but he would be back for his band. He has a history of being suicidal so I left work early after the call from his friend and came home to a note from him apologizing for breaking my heart saying I was to good for him and that we were different people who want different things out of life and he was tired of hurting me & the people he loved so he was leaving town for a while. I don't know what to think. I am obviously upset I gave him 5 yrs of my life and he said he wanted the same things I did, mainly a family, and here I am alone while he's god knows where. I don't know what my next move should be or how to feel.

My roomate and I live together great, except that her boyfriend is over all the time. He stays there at least five nights a week, that is the agreement we had ahead of time, but my mind has changed and I want to cut it back to four nights a week.  I feel like he is living there. He doesn't pay rent or do chores. He lives at his parents, so they can't go to his place ever. Four nights a week is still more than half the week! But she doesn't like that idea and doesn't understand why my opinion changed. I don't like going home five nights in a row and seeing him there. Any ideas on how to handle this? Our lease is not up, so we can't move out yet.

We may have missed out only because we both seemed kind of shy, it would be terrible if to people meant for each other were just to shy to keep it going.

20070714195350AAw4Slg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Falling in love with a co-worker...?	So I am falling in love with a co-worker.      She works in a different department, and only on weekends, so we see each other for maybe ten minutes a week. In that time we flirt a bit ie. she tells me how awesome and sweet I am, and says "i love you!" in that playful kinda way, blows me kisses etc etc.      She has a boyfriend, and I know that it isn't my ground to be treading on. I recently broke up with my girlfriend because it wasn't fair to stay with her when there is another woman on my mind all day long. It feels like the first time I was in love. She's the only thing I can think about.       It's gotten to a point where going to work cramps up my chest because I know she isn't there, and when she is there I won't be able to speak to her. She often comes down to say hello and such, and asks when I'm on next, and when it isn't for another week she says something like "so I have to wait another week before I see you again?"      How can I get out of this? I feel like quitting because it's so hard

I have posted 2 other questions on the subject but I like hearing what other people have to say on the subject. There is a girl I have known for a long time and we have always been best friends. I am not even concerned about getting a gf because it almost feels like I am waiting until we can have a more serious relationship that would last forever...Weird i know. Im only 16 and all my friends get gf's and they break up in a month or 2 and sometimes more and I dont want that to happen. We talk all the time. Hang out occasionally and its always fun and she seems really excited to see me. Over the computer and phone I always have to say something to her first then she starts talking a lot. I don't really know whats going on or what to expect from this relationship. Thanks.

20070729062240AAqyRHg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship advice from the ladies?	ok so, my friend that ive like for ages went to live with her aunty for 6 months, when she was away i spoke to her on the internet and rang her once or twice a week. i felt really close to her and thought things would be "great" when she got back, if u know what i mean. there were so many signals that she was into me, saying things like i cant wait to ee you and i really miss our hugs and our talks. and stuff like that. but, when she got back it was like that connection never existed at all, like she was a strnager and it was allways awkward when we were alone together. So, i told her how i felt and she came out with "I just want to be your friend". i couldnt beleave it, i felt she had literally been leading me on. and now she just plays it off as some kind of joke that i told her how i felt. well anyway i would just like to know what the hell is going on in her head and if any girls out there have some kind of insight, id love to hear your thoughts.

He emailed me constantly, and we would chat on messenger everyday, for hours. He told me he really liked me, we shared lots of intimate information with each other, and I was awaiting him comming to visit me soon. All of a sudden it stopped. He always had an excuse why he wasn't talking to me. I accepted it for a while, but now he has not talked to me for over a week! He has not answered any of my emails, and has not been on messenger so we can chat. I really felt that we had a great connection. I have never gotten along with someone so well. He could always make me feel better when I felt down. Now I feel like I have a big hole in my heart. Should I just try to forget him, give him time? I am having trouble forgetting him.

Also, I'm afraid that if I don't sit w/ the people I sat w/ last year that they will b mad at me.

20070808165443AAm0UZf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think that this would be wierd?	so this girl said that she kinda lost interest in me b/c I did not ask her out sooner but she still texts me every day and comes to see me at work and stuff. alot of ppl think she still likes me and just wants me to ask her on a date. we have talked for over 5 months and she just said that 2 days ago. do you think that it would be wierd to ask her out now? it seems kinda arkward to me to ask her since she just told me that. but if she likes me still then I think she would like me to? is that wired to ask her? what should I say to ask her? do you think she still likes me?
20070812024657AAC6Xxj	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What should I do as i am so mixed up (14 years old) I have tried talking to my mother but it doesn't work.	My mother admitted to me the other day that she had been seeing her 'new' boyfriend for when she was married. I was devastated as she promised to me that she hadn't but the only reason I found out was because I was arguing with her boyfriend- she has broke up with him in teh past as we have all been verbally abused by him and he lied to us. He has apparently changed but I told him that I don't believe and he has never made the effort to want to see me again but instead picks my mother up and goes out with her. Many physics, friends and family have warned her off but she won't listen . I feel uncomfortable when he is around, and considered living with my father,but I know the reason my mother divorced him in the first place was because my father physically abused my mother (my elder sister and I saw some occcurances). My mother said that my father raped and bullied her but I am still on speaking terms with her.beacause of all of this I don't feel comfortable living with my father.
20070814120953AAnntDe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do any girls like full on guys?	I am talking about guys who show their great interests in you right away and are very strong onto you very quickly.      not like sexual kind, but in love kind?      why is this such a big turnoff for some girls?      why do they think the guy is "desperate"?   why do they want to chase guys who act all "cool" and everything?      seems like a fake and very shallow world that i live in, as i dont and cant hide my interests when i am interested in a girl.      been called a "stalker" as well, but not really one, just like to chase.

20070823004350AAvFBD1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How is my love letter to my boyfriend of six months?	My love,  Its midday and im thinking about you like always. Im not a really romantic person and im no good at romantic gestures (I always end up laughing.) as you know. Im not much of a girlfrend. I do try though and I do it so that maybe you will feel what im trying to say. I've never felt this way about anyone in my life. Its hard to explain how I feel. i know without you im empty. I cant imagine how life would be if I had never met you. For me there are no second thoughts, no regrets about us. With all the tears and trouble we've been through its worth it becaues I got to share my heart with you. I cant remember what my life was without you. It must have been somethng like living in the dark. You;ve opend my eyes to so much.Its hard for me to say that word, love, becaues the word cant even begin to describe how I feel for you. The way I want to kiss you the way I want to hold you the way I honestly never want to let go.

20070907171215AAh3Hpb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	People think we're dating and guy friend won't deny that we are?	It is somehow going around school and town that my guy friend and I are dating, when really, we're not and we both know it. However, he refuses to tell everyone that we're not. He simply says its none of their business and makes a big deal about how they keep asking.  His ex-girlfriend has gotten particularly involved and hasn't talked to me since all this gossip started. She got her sister to ask my friend if we're dating instead.        I really do like him, but I think if people think we're dating, we might as well be dating. It makes no sense to just pretend we are.       Why doesn't he just say "No, we aren't dating" instead of making it an open question with everybody? He won't deny or confirm anything and its making me wonder.

20071010165908AAaIsx4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is he doing?	My ex broke up with me thru text 3 months ago, I couldn't believe he could do that to me cause I never did anything to him to treat me with such little respect so I was hurt and I never talked to him after that but then a month ago he text me saying sorry for everything and that he lost two friends and it had him thinking about who was important  in his life and he wanted me to know that im important to him and he was sorry that he didnt show it before. I accepted the apology and didnt say too much about anything to him cause I didnt want to act like I thought that meant we would be getting back together I just felt like maybe he had a guilty conscience or something, but it seems like he wants to be closer then what I thought I got this brick wall up cause Im not trying to look like the one trying or hoping we get back together but I dont know what he's doing it seems like he really wants to be cooler with me. What should I do? I dont want to let my guards down and seem like I want him

20080329132029AA4jg27	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So theres this boy?	And hes a total sweetheart and ive been in love since we went out over the summer. but his friends and my friends made us break up becuase one of his friends liked me blah blah blah. So now i want to tell him, and i was thinking of writing a note, tellin him to read it when im gone, then run with my best friend to the bathroom to hide becuase i get really nervous. He happens to be one of my best friends too. He is a music loving guy who likes cats, and skatboarding, i am a music loving girl who LOVES cats and likes gymnastics. The problem is, we used to be perfect, but since ive gotton popular this year, ive changed, should i go back to how i used to be around him, or just be more sweet around him? also, should i write him a song to tell him how i feel? i was planning on wearing either my favorite lucky jeans, uggs, and orange tanktop for good luck, or maybe my lucky tee, or should i go differently? please tell me, HOW SHOULD I TELL HIM! what should i wear!Do i act like my old self?SOS
20080226094741AAQDDdG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How many of the guys here have it in them to just go up to a girl and ask her out?	I'm not talking about your friend or someone you  know. I'm talking about seeing a hot girl at the movies or the mall. you like them, so you just go up to her and make a conversation without thinking too much about it and actually get a date?      You hear stories about it, but who actually does it?

20080306180738AAin0bc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you get over hurt ?	I used to like this guy and i have posted like 5 questions about him before. i just cant get over the hurt. I feel so bitter in my heart and nothing seems to make me feel better. i guess its because i didn't get a closure with him and i dont think i will because i will never see him again and even if i did he would most likely turn his face. it makes me feel really bad. my fault was that i liked him and afcourse he is taken, i understand that but why did he have to stab my heart that way. he could have been nice about it.  the worst part is when i think about him i feel bitter and humiliated. when i don't think about him, i feel disconnected and de-motivated. i don't know how to deal with this. its been a month now. how do you cope with hurt feelings ?

20080402165235AA3FGIu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Romance Assistance Needed!?	You guys have given great advice in the past and I am in dire need of some now.  I work in an office that receives a lot of visits from salesman.  One in particular has been coming around for about 5 months.  In the Fall we began hanging out about twice a week, movies, dinner.  This has been going on ever since with us getting slightly closer.  When we go out together he puts his arm around me and sometimes pulls me into his arms but he's never even tried for a kiss.  I am usually good at deciphering signals but am at a loss with this one.  He comes in sometimes 3 times a week to see me, often asks me to hang out either solo or with his friends, calls me beautiful and NEVER mentions dating other women.  I am tired of the guessing.  Don't even know if there is anything to guess but if he doesn't want romance, why does he continue to come around, take me to lunch, etc,?        Any clues/suggestions?

He's still tender, he reaches out to hug and kiss me. He tells me he loves me. He said he wants the passion we had in the beginning. I don't know what to do.

She will leave me out of the conversation and just talk to him and start flirting. She has a boyfriend but she kind of has the reputation of taking guys away from her friends. The guy she is dating now she took from her "ex-bestfriend". I'm really scared & I don't know how to tell her. Because once I do tell her. She is either going to get mad or go off and tell my boyfriend or hers. And then they will all think I am just being stupid & will get mad at me. She does dumb things. Like make me look really stupid in front of my boyfriend and im kind of sick of it. What do I do? && How do I tell her? Please help!

20080220081857AAXir7W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Really good romantic love songs to slow dance to???	Hi, my name is Ricky. Im 16.. I have been with my girlfriend Ashley since November 8, 2006.. I love her to death with everything I have and more. She means the world to me.. And i constantly am reminding her how much I love her. I treat her very well, I am not with her for reasons many other guys get with women for, I truly love this girl. Im nice to her, I do things for her, buy her things, give me massages, and cook for her, but I've realized i've never really done anything truly romantic. So i planned something out for her for today, I have a late valentines gift because I had no money on V-day, and i bought fake scented rose pedals, a teddy bear holding a heart shaped box that you can put things in, and some other things. I was going to put the rose pedals leading to the bed and sit her down and then play a song and ask her to dance with me. I just need good ideas of really good slow songs, good meaningful lyrics and good rhythm, i want to make this very special for her. Thx 2 all

20080224120440AAh6xa4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get the first kiss? Ladies, I heartfully need your help!?	I am a senior in high school and am dating this wonderful girl. I told her I liked her almost exactly a month ago, and she felt the same way and I guess we just started off from there. I have taken her out on I'd say 3 dates and still haven't reached the moment of the first kiss. The problem is, when we are in the car and I'm saying bye to her, she never really gives me eye contact. Now, not to brag or anything, but we cuddle a lot and I just don't want her to be mad that I haven't kissed her yet. So I have a question, ladies, is it lame to ask her, "Could I kiss you right now?" for our first kiss? She told me last night the story of how her cousin died last summer and she was really emotional, I really wanted to ask her, but i didnt know if that would have been lame. Thanks so much for all your help, this girl means a lot lot lot to me.

20080302163111AARutXf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	'Friends with benefits' or the real thing?	Okay so this is the same guy as in my first question. My friends, him and I were hanging out at my place, then he randomly kissed me. And a real kiss. Then a little later we made out a bit.  I was sure he'd probably ask me out, though he didn't. It just sort of went away. My friends are telling me he said we're 'friends with benefits', sometimes they say he likes me, and sometimes they don't know anything, or that he's going to 'make a move on me'.  He asked me to the movies about a week after the kiss, but I thought he ment as in everyone until two of my guy friends said he wouldn't let them go because they 'had no one to go with'. And when he asked me who else should go, he always suggested other couples.  Now whenever we hang out, we act like a couple. No kissing since then, but only because we haven't had the chance I think. What should I do? What is it he wants? We're not really dating, but not just friends either. Confused, help!

20080325114809AABwEhx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me?	Long story, but basically my friend stabbed me in the back and asked a girl out after I told him I was gonna her out. Ive been feeling down about it for a while now.   Anyway, I don't even know if she thinks as me more than a friend. When I text her if I say something nice she will reply something like "aw your so sweet" or something along those lines. I always try to make her feel special, and she seems to act like that towards me too. Every night we start a text conversation and say goodnight to each other. It was usually me who said goodnight to me but after a couple of nights she texted me if I didnt text her. Does this really mean anything or am I just looking to deep into it?

20080330135212AAAE7dM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How's my plan for our Six Month Anniversary?	Our six month is coming up and I thought about doing this...   We'll have all of Saturday off so first we'll go to the San Francisco Zoo. After that we'll drive about 10mins to the Japanese Tea Gardens at Golden Gate Park and walk around looking at that. And then drive 5mins to dinner at this restaurant called El Mansour, it's Moroccan food and they put on belly dancing shows. Overall it should cost less than $115. She's wanted to go to the tea gardens for quite some time now, she loves animals, and she's tired of going to the same restaurants every night so she wants to try something new. Sooo I thought I'd surprise her with this.      Any suggestions? Don't say get her a gift cos her gift is time spent with me... how would you improve this and is it too much?
