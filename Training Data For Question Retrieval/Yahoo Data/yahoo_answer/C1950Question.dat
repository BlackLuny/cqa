I have downloaded about twelve ringtones from Myxer.com. Actually, I have downloaded about 30 but only twelve will play. The others download, but won't play. A message says "The media being played is of an unsupported format," although it plays fine during the preview. It is very frustrating. I'm hoping someone knows of a better site to download ringtones from for a BlackBerry. Please help before I throw this thing out the window! :)

Hi all, i just got naked adsl activated on my deactivated telstra line but the only problem is i can't figure out if the line is still connected in the house somewhere.

20090219184512AA42jP5	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Is it worth it to buy a PS3?	Right now i have a Wii and an Xbox 360. Honestly, the Wii bores me. I love my 360, but there are a few things that i don't like about it, such as the game genre selection. Seriously, like 90% of 360 games have to do with war/killing. It gets kinda old. So, ive noticed that the PS3 has some more unique games, such as LittleBigPlanet and Afrika. Id really like to own those innovative games, as well as games like Resistance and Killzone. I'll be raking in around 600 bucks this summer from my job, so price wont be too much of a problem, and im wonder if i should get a PS3. Should i?        PS: i have a 1080p tv so i would be able to fully utilize the blu-ray capacity of the ps3...

20090220234126AAdW9aJ	Consumer Electronics;TVs	Why Is Off Air HD TV better than Analogue Off Air TV?	Question:     Who benefits more from the switch from  Off Air Analogue TV to HD Off Air TV, the  people or the cable and satellite companies?      --------------------------------------...      If you want to watch TV with an antenna called Off Air and you have been using analogue technology all these years now you will have no choice but to use HDTV off air antenna if you want free TV provided you can receive channels in your area.      When using analogue, depending on your location you could get a number of different TV stations free without paying cable or satellite subscriptions.  You may have had some far away channels that weren't completely clear, maybe with some with static, snow or ghosting or some without being 100% clear in their sound but that was okay you could live with it.  It was free and that is the price you pay or don't pay when you get it free.  If you wanted 100% clear clean reception you would pay for it.      WIth Off Air HDTV you don't have the same choices like you did before.  You either get the station clearly or you don't get any channel whatsoever, nothing, nada, zip, zero, zilch.      If you can't receive the channels with your HD antenna then you have no choice but either give up TV or pay for satellite or cable TV.      There are many people who either don't want to pay for satellite or cable or cant afford it, when they can get what they want free.

20090221001536AAd6no9	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	What is the best set up to use Netflix with an Xbox 360?	I just got Netflix and love the feature for instant streaming video to my tv.  The problem is that the connection goes down and there is nothing I can consistently do to get it back up- it just does what it wants and can be down for days.  My internet connection is an upgraded tier internet service through Cox cable and is located in my home office.  Since the tv is in the family room, I am using a DLink Airplus Extreme G Wireless router (model DI-624) to send the signal to my Xbox 360 via its wireless adaptor.  While I'm watching a movie, the Xbox Live will loose its connection, which actually causes my whole internet connection to crash.  I will unplug both modem and router and on/off the console, which will get the internet back up, but when I try to connect to Xbox live, the internet temporarily goes offline.  I know this from watching the computer control panel while doing the testing.  I have tried closing various programs on the computer and even turning off the firewall, but to no avail.  Am I the only one experiencing this?  Is it my equipment?  If anyone has any set up suggestions, I would very much appreciate it.

20090221004346AA9ePXE	Consumer Electronics;Land Phones	Is it true that with AT&T cable phone service, you can dial 911 EVEN when the cable or internet is down?	I currently have regular, traditional basic phone service with AT&T and limited internet service (the $15 a month plan).  I admit my internet service is a bit slow, but I can put up with it since I really don't download anything.  I am considering switching to AT&T's unlimited cable phone service plan which would require me to upgrade a bit on my internet service (to the $25 a month plan).  My biggest concern here is whether or not their ads are absolutely true that with their cable phone service, you will always be able to reach 911 service at any time...EVEN during a power outage, EVEN when the internet or cable is out, etc.   In other words, that would mean that the cable phone service is as reliable as traditional phone service (which, means that the only thing that would prevent you from dialing 911 is that something unusual affects the phone line to the point that it needs to be repaired)
