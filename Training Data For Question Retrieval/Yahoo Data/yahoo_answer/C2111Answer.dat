Think about it: if their was no motivation for users to limit the amount of questions they ask, and answer that of others, yahoo answers would be pointless. People would post, but no one would answer. The asker would post, only to later on be disappointed in finding out that no answers have been given. Users would lose purpose, quit, and pretty soon, yahoo answers would be an unused service. You can thank the point system for the answers that you will receive on this very question.<br>  <br>  The point system for yahoo answers is pretty simple. Basically, for every question you answer, two points are added to your count. For every unresolved question that is in voting, you can gain a single point by voting for a best answer. However, be weary of the amount of questions you post. For each question asked, 5 points are deducted.<br>  <br>  As you gain points, you will increase your Y!A level. Y!A has a system of seven levels. When a user begins the service, they start at level one, and are given 100 points to get them going. Once your point count exceeds 250, you move up to level 2. At 1000 points, you become a level 3. This system goes on until you gain 25,000 points, making you a level 7.<br>  <br>  Level 1: 1 - 249 points<br>  Level 2: 250 - 999 points<br>  Level 3: 1,000 - 2,499 points<br>  Level 4: 2,500 - 4,999 points<br>  Level 5: 5,000 - 9,999 points<br>  Level 6: 10,000 - 24,999 points<br>  Level 7: 25,000+ points<br>  <br>  For each level increased, you will gain rewards that you can use to improve your influence on yahoo answers. For example, once you reach level two, you gain the ability to rate answers with a thumbs up or a thumbs down. You will be able to answer and ask more questions per day as you get a higher level, and once you reach level five, you will not be limited to the amount of questions you can answer and ask.<br>  <br>  For more information on the yahoo answers point system, see this link: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=AtIrPstAwZrfT7XsQOY56Hjpy6IX;_ylv=3">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a>|`|FqrKjtzwaa	To get points, answer questions.

cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Once the best answer is picked there is no way to reverse it. You can always ask the question again. Just don't do it too often since that can be a violation.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	No, you can't re open it so people can answer it again....but you can look at it by just going to the question tab on your profile and clicking on the question. But if you want more info on the subject, re ask it.|`|uhZ38xYkaa	No, there is no way.
3267581d4fe0c877a2fee89c9c9a0c43aa	Your initial question is on target...we owe you nothing.  However, it may simply be that nobody is really interested in answering a question you consider "in depth" because they consider it trivial.  As far as how to handle it, I'd say "with a grain of salt" if you get vulgar or demeaning answers, ignore or report them, if you get vague answers, try your best to decipher them.  I have yet to ask any questions on here because I read so many questions on here and hear that little voice in my head saying "Duh...stupid question" quite a bit.  Hopefully your questions aren't one of those.|`|suPD7c3gaa	I'm sorry, but any question that takes an hour to construct... is WAY too long.  Do YOU want to read through questions that are that long??  Keep your questions as concise as possible, easy to read and not too much information. Sometimes there are fine details given that just aren't necessary.  Personally, I think people need to think twice about posting some of the extremely personal questions they post on here.  They are here forever.  Even if we could delete them... they're out there someplace.  So that's something to think about.  So fine tune your questions, so they are short, clear and concise, and you'll get more answers.<br>  <br>  And you're right... no one "owes" you an answer.  We're all here of our own free will, and other than agreeing to abide by the rules, we are not required to give you an answer.  We all answer what we want to answer.|`|RhkKGsipaa	This site is purely voluntary,nobody owes you any thing.  if your nose is so far out of joint,   you might be better going elsewhere.

Many cities have huge parades, paint the centerline of the streets green, and have other special celebrations. So why not a special section to ask questions about this holiday? And believe me, here in the US, it is about the HOLIDAY, not about the Saint.

e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	How to fight spam and scams:<br>  <br>  #1: Yahoo has a spamguard filter, but only if multiple users report an address as spam will it be treated as such by the filter.<br>  <br>  You have a personal list for blocking addresses in spam options. Anything you mark as spam in Mail classic will be added to that list, in New Yahoo mail adding addresses to the list has to be done manually. If you ever receive anything from those addresses in the future, it will be deleted automatically, you won't even notice when you got some more crap from them. One problem though: the list of blocked addresses is limited to 500 and spammers often change their address. So you must sometimes delete some of the older blocked addresses to make room for new ones.<br>  <br>  Go to this link where everything is explained in detail:<br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/mail/spamguard1.html">http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/...</a><br>  <br>  #2: The Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov) is supposed to help you eliminate spam mails. Forward spam to: spam@uce.gov, in the subject line enter something like "unsubscribe link results in more spam", "unwanted spam message", "no unsubscribe link" or something similar.<br>  <br>  Here's how to do the forwarding bit: click the crtl key and at the same time click the "forward" button to forward a message as an attachment, mac users should click the "apple" key and click "forward" simultaneously. <br>  <br>  When the FTC gets your mail, they will look into the matter and when they find out who the spamming source is, they will take legal actions. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/spam/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/sp...</a><br>  <br>  #3: Check Mailwasher, it helps to eliminate spam from your inbox...<br>  <br>  Set up your email account(s) in MailWasher and hit the "Check Mail" button. It then downloads all new message headers and displays message details alongside each one (priority, subject, from, to, etc.). Any email that MailWasher considers to be spam is highlighted for easy sorting.<br>  <br>  Two checkboxes are located next to each message header: "Delete" and "Bounce". If you click "Delete" the email will be marked for deletion, click "Bounce" and the mail will be marked for bouncing - a fake "address not found" email will be sent to the sender. Once you have decided what to bounce and delete, click "Process Mail" to get it done and your mail client launched for downloading all accepted emails.<br>  <br>  MailWasher has a "blacklist" and a "friends list" to enter good and bad email addresses. Addresses in the blacklist are marked for deletion, and addresses in the friends list will be marked as okay. Filters can be set to increase MailWasher's effectiveness. You can have email addressed to "undisclosed recipients" automatically deleted and bounced for example.<br>  <br>  Note: the program is free but limited to one email account. MW Pro supports multiple mail accounts.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mailwasher.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mailwasher.net/</a><br>  <br>  Sorry, don't know specifics for other mail services.
jKfV6DoOaa	Depends where you are in the world. In Germany there is actually such a website that you can make free phone calls and I do use it all the time when I am there. But you still need to have a phone for that because I need to put my number as the number calling in one field and the number I want to call in the other field and then they connect my phone ( which rings then ) and I pick up and then it connects my phone with the number I am trying to call and then I can make free phone calls. But that only works if you live in Germany. Here in the USA i don't know about such a service. <br>  <br>  You can make free test calls from this web page <a href="http://www.freecall.com/en/calling-rates.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freecall.com/en/calling-rates...</a><br>  but then they want you still to get some credit at some point. <br>  <br>  I would suggest you just get as little as $10 of Yahoo!Call Out credit. Here is all the info <a href="http://voice.yahoo.jajah.com/home/phoneout.castle" rel="nofollow">http://voice.yahoo.jajah.com/home/phoneo...</a><br>  <br>  And here are all the super cheap rates for phone calls that you can make all over the world with Yahoo!Messenger. <br>  <a href="http://voice.yahoo.jajah.com/home/rates.castle" rel="nofollow">http://voice.yahoo.jajah.com/home/rates....</a><br>  <br>  I used that all the time and it works great. You have also customer technical support with that in a live chat <a href="https://jajah.custhelp.com/app/utils/chat" rel="nofollow">https://jajah.custhelp.com/app/utils/cha...</a> and a costumer phone number that you can call if you have problems. <br>  +1-866-621-2190 <br>  Your $10 call out credit last a very long time and the great part is that your credit doesn't expire at all if you make one phone call at least every 180days... and we all make more calls then that in a day. LOL! You don't have any long term contracts either. If you do not want it anymore then just don't get any credit anymore. It's very easy and cheap and good.<br>  With skype you pay much more and at least a few months in advance and you do not have real customer support. You can just send them an e-mail and they send you more or less an automated answer and no help at all. Skype doesn't have costumer support in a live chat or a costumer support number. <br>  <br>  I would recommend you to go with Yahoo!Call Out as I showed you above. Hope you try it out because it's really fun.|`|OqT7XKEQaa	As far as I know, you cannot do that.. You alsways need to run some software to do that.. the most popular one is Skype.|`|GQiM1nWFaa	You can visit this site it has lots of great information on free calls<br>  <a href="http://voipsms.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://voipsms.blogspot.com</a>
suPD7c3gaa	Once you click on forward, you will open a Compose window that will contain the entire email, including the previous recipient's addresses.  Just highlight and delete.  Be sure to use the bcc field if you're sending to multiple recipients, so your recipients don't have the same problem or question.|`|lx4mAQW1aa	I'm not sure of other E-mail clients, though I would imagine they have similar features...<br>  <br>  In thunderbird, right click a selected message, then click "edit as new". This has the same effect as forwarding, except you can edit the previous e-mail, and remove recipients before sending.

If you didn't choose that option, you can click on your avatar (or "My Profile" over on the upper right), and click on the "My Questions" tab to view your questions.

AA11562077	Yes, though I try to abstract those thoughts and think of the process as just "running something up the flagpole to see who salutes" - or shoots as the case may be.  There's also been a spate of some of my questions being deleted recently -- and no response to my "Appeals" except a form answer that I had "Violated Community Guidelines", despite my explanations to the contrary which I though were sound.<br>  <br>  I feel the same way about answering, too. I recently had a troubling thing happen, where I answered a question put by a person who had become a close Y/A friend.  In particular, another answerer had found the question to be shallow and had said so -- and had been buffeted by a series of criticisms for putting his viewpoint -- not from the inevitable crew of trolls, but by usually liberal-minded answerers.  In my own answer I agreed with him, and with his edits where he complained at being castigated for his viewpoint.  But of us were fairly caustic, though not insulting the way some can be, and offered some perspective that I thought was reasonable criticism.  <br>  <br>  To my surprise, I now find myself blocked by that old friend who had put the question, and feel really bad.  Besides the loss of the dialogue with him I enjoyed, there's also the fact that I now cannot open any of the many questions I've answered by him, and so lost my own writing about the many interesting topics he introduced of these months, and the responses of the others to all those questions as well.<br>  <br>  I don't know.  Maybe my comments were somewhat ill-considered -- I certainly meant no harm.  But the result is that I do now feel quite vulnerable, and hesitant to write what I think in either questions or answers, without editing myself as if I was speaking to some authority or other.  A real loss.|`|q6H2ru3waa	sometimes|`|kVDGsDuZaa	Yes|`|6dL7UGvfaa	My questions have all dried up, I do not ask questions!|`|QCejFqXgaa	Blessings yes that is the reason i do not ask to many question, but i think that if you Ask fun questions,  you    get fun answers. Ask  serious questions, get serious answers. ...And if you ask Religious questions you get call all kind of names, from people that do not know any thing about you,  just that you are a Christian . But if most of the people are your friends and contact then one do not need to feel vulnerable among friends.. So stick with who you knows and really care about you for real.. Nice question.Have a bless-day|`|AA11894640	Yes!<br>  <br>  It true that when we ask a question...serious or not...we are presenting ourselves to yahoo public for reaction...now would be of ridicule or respect...depends as much on our question as their perception and/or nature.  <br>  <br>  Some people are naturally rude...in all their answers;  while a wide majority is decent and helpful.  <br>  <br>  We must learn to take it all in our stride...|`|suPD7c3gaa	No.  I would never, EVER ask anything personal on here as I don't think my personal life should rely on perfect and complete strangers.

(IMPORTANT!  DO NOT us an image that's tiny/avatar sized to start with.  You must use 'normal' size image files.)  Then you need to put the image you'd like to use as your avatar on your 360 page. You may already have one. If you do, you would be able to access it from your profile. Just click on your avatar (or "My Profile" on the upper right). The 360 option will be on the upper right.

Besides, even if your account goes below zero, Yahoo won't stop you from posting questions, so they aren't even valuable in that respect.|`|gyv0fMQZaa	Yes!!<br>  <br>  I feel that if I ask a question, I shouldn't be penalized for supporting <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com.">http://answers.yahoo.com.</a> We should be thanked with 100 points whenever we feel like asking!|`|8Initt1aaa	No, I understand why.

It also prevent spammers and scammers from flooding the site using auto posters.  If not points were deducted they could take over the site very quickly.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Nope not at all.

ixcbLAMWaa	The way the economy is right now? You will never find a "cheap" apartment to live in. And getting a good well paid job is pretty hard nowadays, because like I said, cause of the economy. But if you want the cheapest place to live in, try Santa Cruz.
qPZPduLXaa	Part of your confusion may be due to the fact that you're given more information than you need, such as the selling price and original fixed and variable costs. Here's what's important:<br>  <br>  Under the new process, every x saves $4, and the whole thing costs an additional $80,000. If you sell just 1 unit, obviously the original method is better, because you lose $79,996. On the other hand, if you sell 100,000, under the new method your variable costs go down $400,000, so your net costs have gone down $320,000. The question is where that tipping point is, and the answer is available by solving a very simple equation:<br>  <br>  4x = 80,000<br>  <br>  Ta da!

suPD7c3gaa	This is not an earth shattering, life altering thing.  Suspensions are usually permanent.  I don't think that's necessarily fair, but that's the way it is.  On rare occasions, an appeal is won, so you could give it a try.  so apparently you were one of the very lucky ones.  Usually it's the entire Yahoo! account, including email.  Seems you just had your Yahoo! Answers account suspended.  If you want to use the old email, that's fine. But If you spend some time here, I would suggest you use the email associated with this Yahoo! Answer account... just to avoid confusion.  It's really your decision.  You don't need our advice.<br>  <br>  Yikes!  I guess you won't do something like that again.  You apparently just weren't thinking. That's not amusing or appropriate for a site like this.  Some sort of action HAS to be taken when someone does something like that, but I'm not convinced that suspension is always the way to go. But I'm not surprised.|`|ffab01a92e978af828e5f1703775e5ddaa	Just forget about that other account, because you will never be able to access it again, even though you might still get things like "best answer" messages for months.<br>  <br>  Blow it off. It doesn't mean a thing anyway.|`|ll6e1VEzaa	Well, if you get too many violations then Yahoo Answers will teaminate your account. And for what you said on the link you posted that was probably the reason your account got terminated. just forget about your other account.

Then after those 4 hours are up, go back to the question that you want to close and they should have blue bars on each answer that says: Choose as Best Answer. Then click on it on the answer that you think it is the best for your question. Be careful of choose one because once you have chose it and closed the question with the WRONG answer, then you can NOT change the best answer after that. Then rate the answer with 1-5 stars and leave a comment about it. Then click OK. There! You have successfully chose a best answer! You will receive 3 points for choose it and the person that you chose as best answer will receive 10 points for it and 1-50 points for the thumbs-up they have on the answer AFTER it was chosen as best answer. REMEMBER to choose the best answer before the deadline closes because you will LOSE your chance to choose the best answer and it will go to the community which they are going to choose the best answer FOR you.

The bubbles read, "Choose as Best Answer," and they appear under each answer. You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.<br>  <br>  To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.

7u77AiBjaa	Double-check that you are using the correct Yahoo services and have followed all the instructions below. Some people confuse the Y!Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) with Yahoo! 360 (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> ). If you've done everything, then likely you just have to wait for a change to be recognized:<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.

Then under that, there is a spot in a text box where you can leave your  comment thanking someone. This comment remains visible after the question is over with. If the question goes to vote, you have to wait for the voting to end,  and if there is a tie, a best answer won't be chosen unless someone comes in with a tiebreaker vote, which if two people come in to vote their answer as best - very typical here on Answers - there will be two answers tied with one vote apiece, or if nobody votes at all, they are tied at zero votes. But if someones answer is voted as best, the only way to leave a comment is to click on where it says "comment (0)" where (0) is how many comments have been left (and won't be zero if any comments have been left), and a text area drops down and opens up where you leave the comment. But these comments do not remain visible when the question is done with. You have to click on the "comment (1)" again to get it to open up and read the comment.

You get the points to go to the next level so you can ask and answer more questions and bragging rights. Good luck!!!|`|ffab01a92e978af828e5f1703775e5ddaa	Absolutely nothing. Zero.

But here is the answer<br>  you can<br>  rate more<br>  answer more<br>  ask more<br>  and be known as a top contributer on a tobic so people will recognize you. <br>  Thats pretty much it but I guess its useful when you want to ask a question you cant find on Google or anywhere else or  a personal question and stuff.<br>  <br>  There is a small small chance that you will win prizes but that is like if you are like a top top contributer who spends all their time on here, it says so in the FAQ.<br>  For me, ive foind it pointless but I like to ask questions and answer questions occasionally, but it really wastes really most of my time. I find myself asking a question and then find myself very off task.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!   :)|`|xFFZ0rH7aa	What you mean they are no good ?

First of all your site<br>  needs in fed data to help you have a computer presentation.  This is<br>    partly what is shown on your google, or record.  What is on your<br>    personal goals performed by your computer is what should be<br>   performed by your computer.  So respect the security and when <br>    using chats realize that the better you behave in realism the better<br>    your computer responds to securing and administrating your home<br>    sites.  Example is do not respond to odd names, anything obscene<br>    is typically illicit, or illegal.  People are not supposed to confront<br>     or intimidate you.  Good questions in a safe situation are about<br>     activities in travel, favorites in histories of your habits or preferences<br>     and your memberships in religious faithful activity.  3 GOOD questions clear with many top experts are:  What religion do you truly<br>    want to be?  What place to you want to live when you find adult life?<br>     Where do you like to read about? Is a pretty good intro for many<br>    people it opens that area of sharing.

RnwrEcY5aa	I am not a mathematician. Not hardly.<br>  But your ability to use numbers can help many people. Mathematics is the language of the universe, but more than that, you have the dicipline to use reason rather than emotion to help people think their way through a problem one step at a time. <br>  <br>  Can you influence others? As a mathematics major, your smart. I don't look to idiots for answers, I look to someone more intellegent than myself. And while there doesn't seem to be many people around here who are more intelligent, there are a few. Some are my favorite contacts. <br>  <br>  Care to join them?|`|LvpjUQSvaa	Sweet I am no mathematician my degrees are in Nursing I think the biggest mathematical influence was Albert Einstein his theoretical equation for relativity appears to be the benchmark for all mathematical and scientific equations.<br>  <br>  I may be wrong in my thinking and hope some other person has the answer you are looking for.<br>  <br>  In terms of the current economic crisis and the mathematics behind the global credit crunch.
