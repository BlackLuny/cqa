ve4K3rb1aa	you'll most often get his error when the disc is damaged.  it;s odd that it worked on one and not th other though.    your best bet is to either take it to a store and have it cleaned - you can alo get stuff to do it at home yourself  you can buy it from those key cutting places and from computer shops like currys.  sometimes you can get it in tesco too.    or clean the disc drive on your comp - sometimes dust can clog up the optic eye and it wont' read any disc.    99% of the time small scratches won't intervere with the disc,  so hopefully if you get it cleaned and filled it will work    civi 3 is a great game!|`|oE0BpxPkaa	Try cleaning with a cotton ball.|`|2wyIOGi7aa	A lot of game stores have a machine that cleans and buffs away scratches...

dnxtnaSgaa	If It is a wheat penny, it could be valuable. Wheat pennies have key dates that make them particularly valuable.    They are as follows:    1909-S - 1.8 million  1909-S VDB - 0.5 million  1914-D - 1.2 million  1922 (No mint mark) - unknown (D is missing)  1931-S - 0.9 million    These are the especially rare ones, for others, here is a link to a wheat penny value table: http://coins.about.com/library/coin_valu...    It appears your penny is worth 70 cents.|`|127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	The 1912 cent is not in the greatest shape and grades good. It can be found in a coin dealers wheat cent box for .05-.25 cents. Some cents are just plain rare due to low mintage's, other may not be rare in low grades, but few were saved in high grades so the value of that type is high. A 1920-S cent is good is worth .25 in grade good but over $200 in high mint state. This in an example of grade rarity. The 1909-S VDB had a mintage of 484,000 so even in low grades it is worth $700 and up and ,ostly up. the 1931-S had a mintage of only 866,000 so it should be around the same prices as the 1909-S VDB but that is not the case since people knew it was a very low mintage and most all were saved so it is an $80 coin and up. In fact it is not that rare even in high mint state. You need to get a Red Book A Guide to U.S. coins for it gives a lot of info on coins it is a good book to study. Hope this helps
6152e7dd6d7ed08ba0772462efe95df4aa	There are a lot of factors, not the least of which is the impact it would have on video game retailers. You're talking about an entire industry that has a close symbiotic relationship with the Video Game industry (developers, publishers, etc). To say that the video game resale industry would fold might be an exaggeration, but it certainly would shrink markedly and would never be the same. I can envision the brick and mortar counts being reduced by as much as half within the first 5 years of a switch to total digital distro. 75% inside of 10yrs. That is of course if that were the only method of getting new releases. There would be no trade-ins for new games, no reservations, no midnight launches, and no resale of the new titles from that point on. Without that, the only things left to make the trip to the mall for are peripherals, systems, and accessories. And maybe the odd strat guide. With those things often being less expensive at big box stores, what's left for the mall-based video game reseller?    Then there is also the issue of convincing gamers that not having a physical disc, premium packaging, and instructions they can hold in their hands and read is a good thing. There is the issue of storage spaces being wiped, accounts being deleted, and every other phobia or legitmate concern people have about technology.     My next concern would be storage space. My 120GB 360 drive is down to 30GB because I've filled it with my disc games (I have a lot of dlc and xbl arcade games as well). If full games with comparable content were to be DL only, there would have to be a reasonable effort to accomodate with moderately priced HDD upgrades. You would need to have at least 500GB, with a preferable 1T option. This of course wouldn't be a problem for PC/MAC gamers, but console gamers would be forced to shell out the cash to upgrade. With Microsoft pushing proprietary drives, and the largest 120GB selling for $150 when comparable drives are selling for $50 to $100 less, this is an issue.    Last but not least is pricing. With the current offerings clocking in at $40 and not having anywhere near the content of a game like Fable 2, it's becomes hard to justify the purchase when full games with packaging are only $20 more. Less in some cases. Add to that the fact that once they have beaten the game, they no longer would have the option of recouping any portion of that cost. Or BUYING any game used for that matter.    So for now, it just seems to be a really hard sell all around. With the exception of the developers and publishers themselves of course.

If you get it on the PC you will need a internet connection every time you play it but on the Xbox 360 you will not. If you want online on the Xbox 360 though you will need to sign up for Xbox Live Gold Membership and need to get a wireless adapter.

KZJIjrguaa	For free online games, try http://www.gsn.com. Look in the WorldWinner games.    Or, if you have the space on your computer, I reccomend Bigjon's PC Games. It takes some space to download, but the games are TOTALLY worth it. His versions of The Price is Right and Deal or No Deal are the crown jewels. No adware or viruses, and best of all, they're free!    1) Go to http://www.bigjonpcgames.com. Click on the Downloads link at the top.    2) Click on the **Needs- First Time Downloads** folder. Download the Needs.exe file. Follow the installation instructions.    3) Go back to http://www.bigjonpcgames.com, download and install the games you want, and enjoy!
s6hhRtQuaa	It's being picked and packed.  In a day or two (or next week) it will say it's being dispatched and that means the game is coming.  All you have to do now is wait for it to come.

ZMcPHP7Yaa	I'd advise you to not waste your time. I'm not being a downer about this, just stating a plain truth. They would get your ideas, through one way or another, and then tell you that they have a development department that handles stuff like card creation and art and whatnot. And since your art/cards/whatever isn't copyrighted, they would technically have every right to use your idea and give you zero credit for it.    I've done the same thing myself in the past and gotten the same answer twice.|`|yzpU5fZJaa	contact kunomi and ask them.|`|m1vr3RR5aa	well, I am not sure cause of how they normally just go by what japan does except they bring them out in different ways.|`|8ihj7f9naa	with lots of money and a good offer to him

You can be friendly to them get the blue face and start a trade route usually you can start a trade route when they have a blue face. When you can purchase the planet/solar system make sure to give them a resonable price if its there homeplanet you would probably offer alot you would know if its there home planet if they have alot of colonies.  Mainly you can tell its value if the planets a t0,t1,t2,or t3 and if they have 1,2,3 colonies 7 if its there homeplanet.     The other way to capture there planets by war. You can go to there planet and keep hitting there colonies with weapons until the bar is full and at the top it says "capture system" you can either destroy the rest of there planet or make it yours.

WMrNa3Doaa	I can't really think of any that are exactly like that, seeing as how most RPG's are the action variety these days.    You might like Lost Odyssey. It's not really action based. It's turned based with a "ring" system. You have to press your button at just the right time to get the most out of your attack. But you're not running around and hacking and slashing.  You just select your attack from a menu.  It also offers the standard mage/sword guy type of players, but there are other characters that have unique attacks and spells. Kind of like black/blue/white magic and so on from the FF series.    You could also check out Tales of Vesperia or Infinite Undiscovery. They are more action based, but they have good story lines and are fun to play.    I also forgot to mention, in lost Odyssey, you learn your various skills through equipping items. Once you learn the skill, you can set it and then equip something else to learn more.  No cute outfits to change into like FF X-2 though.|`|yVWKiTwTaa	dont own a 360 and never will, but, to my understanding it is the system with the most rpg's out there. It also has many mmorpg's, you just gotta look around. by the way, you didnt miss anything in X-2, yuna never found tidus and the the game was very weak and lacking alot compared to X.
AA10010715	If the game is installed you need to use the disk 1 to start the game.  Since you made changes to the game file when you installed it it might not be recognizing the disk.  If the disk isn't the original game disk it won't recognize the disk.  Do a search for Sims 2 nocd patch.  This will allow you to play the game without using the disk.

When the fight starts do not attack Hedrox, this will only cause him to multiply.    What you need to do is get him in the water you saw at the start. At the bottom floor there is 6 slanted supports (3 on each side). Destroy all of them (takes about 3-4 attacks). You will fall to another floor, on the next floor repeat. Keep at it till Hedrox falls into the water, all but 1 will be killed.     Then there will be a scene and you move on in the game.

Sometimes the people might not show up when you add them to the family so just save and go back to the neighborhood.

To make your own pattern, draw the design on heavy craft paper or cardboard. Since you mentioned that you aren't much of a sewer, you might find that lacing with yarn or even some fabric adhesives would work. The filling is usually a poly fiber, but you can always recycle an old pillow to keep the cost down.    Just curious, what kind of class is it for?

aQTlygsCaa	It varies on the type of person you are. The are both different and have their ups and downs. Helicopters are not something you could master in a day. Cars... you could... but people have their crashes. I'd say, if youre in a rush for something fun, get the RC Car, but if youre a patient person who is willing to repair a RC helicopter in the long run because you crashed alot, then i would suggest getting the RC helicopter. Aside from that, its personal preference.|`|eHXZRohxaa	well first of all i wouldn't get a nitro car i have 6 nitros and there a great hobby but they don't just start and run first time every time. You have to love em and have alot of time. between cars and hellis, well i am a car man but some of my mates have hellis and they like em. the only thing about hellis is they are very easy to crash even if you have heaps of experience with them.     just remember both are fun if you get electric. if you don't have alot of time and patience and probs more cash then i'd electric. the thing about electric cars is if you don't get brushless(the type of motor) then  the most you'll get out of an electric car motor is a year at most. if i had two-hundred $ then i'd probably get a twister bell medi-vac helli.|`|YB72BLdWaa	I'm not an R/C person, but my DH is (nitro & electric cars).  I'm sure the helicopters are a hellafun, but I know there's a lot of risk with crashing them and such.  There is an expense with maintenance for any r/c product.  However, Nitro cars carry other expenses over regular electric cars/planes/choppers.  There is also a huge learning curve with Nitro vehicles vs. electric.  With RTR electric, you just basically take them out of the box, charge the battery, and you're good to go.  When my DH got his first nitro, it took him 2 weeks to be able to get it started and stay that way.  If you decided to go to a Nitro, an inexpensive but decent route would be to check out the CEN brand of cars.  I know that you can get a decent one for under $200.  Not sure if they come with controllers or not (My DH writes for a magazine, so he gets all that crap for his articles) so you might want to factor in that expense as well.|`|BcejNZfcaa	I would say the RC Helicopter.. check below for the link to a good store for them.

EVjoCpjEaa	In Harvest Moon DS, you should be able to save on that floor, reload the file/turn the game off and turn back on, and the mine creatures should disappear on that floor. That's one of the many glitches that are fixed in the girl version that came afterwards.  I imagine this would be rather time-consuming though.      If you buy the medium Harvest Goddess hat from Van (you'll have to wait about a season after buying the small version first) and equip it in the mines, your stamina won't fall AT ALL when the mine creatures attack you.    Your stamina also won't go down when using your tools (without charging.) Your stamina will still go down if you fall down a hole though.    Or, just run around and try to avoid the mine creatures and focus on falling down holes (make sure you have lots of food to keep your stamina high).|`|daHSlMFUaa	the only way would be cheat codes---- Action Reply codes. there are AR codes where you have MAX or INFINITE staminas at all times. i haven't come across a code that get rid of the 'monsters' though.    other than AR codes, i don't think there's away

Sangan's effect only brings cards to your hand from your deck, not to the field from the deck.  So, yes, you can choose Yubel with Sangan's effect because he has a determined Attack of 0, but he will get added to your hand, not your field.|`|KAuPPyxDaa	Ofcourse you can, you can even bring out yubel to the field with Mystic Tomato. First of all, Sangan can bring any card out with 1500 atk or less.|`|LoRVjAYsaa	sangan only brings a monster with 1500 or less ATK from the DECK to your HAND, you can't summon yubel with it... use sangan's effect to take mystic tomato to your hand, then you use mystic tomato's effect to summon yubel.    just read your card effect and you'll know...|`|lkr6ah7Raa	Read sangan's effect one more time and it would all be clear.

hmreItQcaa	I help put together blankets for homeless shelters with a local club. We crochet 7" by 9" blocks. I use a J Hook and worsted weight yarn. Each block takes about 30 minutes, and we make 49 squares (roughly 25 hours) per blanket. This makes the blanket 49" x 63" before the border. Sewing them together takes about 4 hours, and a simple border takes 2. So if you're crocheting 2 hours a day, you could have a blanket in 2-3 weeks, depending on how fast you are. Good luck!|`|dxOqd5bnaa	A lot depends on your pattern as well. I like working the mile-a-minute patterns. I've made several of these afghans for gifts. they go pretty fast. I can make one of the stripes in an evening if that's all I do. Hope you enjoy crocheting. For me, it's almost therapeutic!!|`|oXcSeBBwaa	i can complete one anywhere from a week to 2 weeks but it depends on how long i work on it each day. on the weekends i do alot of it.  during the week not so much cos of school and work.|`|154dzJ1Faa	While someone can say how long it would take THEM to make a blanket, you may spend more or less time.  It all depends on so many factors, and it's very hard for anyone to tell you how long it would take.  All I can say is allow yourself plenty of time.    I don't like to put deadlines on anything.  No doubt something will come along to upset my plans.  So I work on it, and when I get done, I get done.  Some projects seem to go a lot faster (maybe because I really enjoy them and spend more time on it) and some seem to just take forever (because I don't like the colour or stitch or something).    The main thing is that you enjoy doing it.  How long it takes you really doesn't matter.  If it was a finished blanket you wanted, you could get one faster and cheaper at WalMart.  If you want a quality blanket, that you put your energy into, then make it yourself, and enjoy the process.|`|411e33cff378a28929963f21b85453abaa	depends also on how fast u crochet.  i work kinda fast,and if I am making a granny square blanket,then I join them as i go.  If I am making a shell-stitch bklanket,i can whip thru it.  i enjoy the process.  Also,i can crochet faster than I can knit! lol  Depends on three factors: hook size,yarn size and time u put into it.   and also how big it is.  Throw size is about 48' 36" i think. Not too long,i should think,about ...  maybe two weeks, depending on the hook and yarn size. Oh and the pattern size. Lacy patterns are more air than yarn,and of course sc is waaay more time consuming than say, dc.|`|AA12343169	You can make one using a large hook and multiple strands of yarn in about 6 hours. Check out the Lion Brand website.  You can make one using a size k hook, and a bulky yarn in about 10 or 12 hours..  You can make one using a size f hook and worsted weight yarn in anywhere from 30 to 50 hours, depending on the difficulty of the pattern.   I was able to make a granny square afghan in a week, the longest part was putting the squares together.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Lately that is the amount of time I have been spending on my crochet also. It has taken me about a month to get half the blocks made for the afghan I am working on. So this one even tho simple will take about 2 months to finish at the amount of time I have to spend on them.    I need to be spending about 6 hours a day on this stuff if I am going to have enough to put in a shop for sale!|`|eRuE2F1Saa	Depends on the size of the hook, the yarn and the pattern.  Some extra large hook patterns are done in a weekend-for something larger, maybe a month.   I do larger than throw sized aphgans and work on them in the evening and weekends and it takes me about three weeks or so from start to  finish.
127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	The series 1953 $5 United States Note is sells for $10 in grade fine, with a tear in the note it cannot grade any higher than that. The series 1953A & 1953B as well as series 1953C sell for the same. The series date is not the date it was printed but the date authorized. This series of notes were printed up into the 1960's. Hope this answers your question.|`|U5LZDb68aa	I tried looking it up and it looks like it would go from $10 to $20 that's on yahoo and ebay anyhow but I would call a bank in a large town and they should be able to tell you, my sister works in one and they always have people coming in to ask them what they should be tring to collect and how much it would be worth. If you find one from 1928 it could go for $1,000 so if I was you I'd hold on to it for awhile longer and hopefully soon yours will be worth close to that or more. Good luck collecting.

AhFeNr8Raa	Wild Nacatl and Wooly Thoctar are the best Naya cards right now. Pretty soon Path to Exile will come out with Conflux and it will be the best removal in the whole set. Branching Bolt is also a great card.    Troll Ascetic, Llanowar Elves, Birds of Paradise, and Chameleon Colossus are the best green creatures you can use.    A lot of people are using Figure of Destiny with Bloom Tender to get 3 extra mana every turn. You can use this to play a huge creature. You can get a 3rd turn Realm Razor this way.    I wouldn't worry about using a "5 power" theme for the deck. Just use the best cards and try to win as fast as you can. You want the best creatures, mana acceleration, and removal.
x1VLBHOJaa	Spiderman would win of course because he has special powers whereas Batman is only human.

Once you get Wrath of the Lich King, your level 70 character can go up to level 80, and explore another set of new areas with new quests.

ErV9sJj7aa	When a new magic set is printed it is standard legal for only a set amount of time.  As new sets come in, old sets rotate out.  When making a standard deck you can only use cards that are standard legal.  Currently lorwyn, morningtide, shadowmoor, eventide, shards, and conflux are the standard sets and you may also use cards from whatever the base set is at that time.  (Currently 10th)<br>  <br>  Block refers to a group of sets that released close to one another, usually 3 sets or so combined.  When making a block deck you can only use cards from those 3 sets.  Not sure if all blocks are 3 sets, or what what sets are considered what blocks but that info is out there and easy to find.|`|evB63qWvaa	A standard block is when you use one of your creatures to block another creature in combat.  You can have as many creatures as you want block one attacking monster unless otherwise stated.|`|82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	Standard consists of the last two sets of cards, plus the most recent core set. Right now, Standard consists of Lorwyn, Morningtide, Shadowmoor, Eventide, Shards of Alara, Conflux, and Tenth edition.<br>  <br>  Block is the most current block. Right now, it is the Shards block, consisting of Shards of Alara, and Conflux.<br>  <br>  Don't be hesitant about asking questions. We were all new once.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|W4k3aeH5aa	Standard and block are terms used to refer to the format the deck is playable/competitive/legal in. Or the format you intend to play your deck in, and the rules that the deck follows.<br>   <br>  As of now: <br>  Sanctioned formats are split into two categories: Constructed and Limited. Constructed formats include Standard, Block Constructed, Extended, Vintage, and Legacy. Limited formats include Sealed Deck and Booster Draft. Standard and Block constructed are the 2 most common formats in  constructed. And it is probably due to the large back up by wizards of the coast- the game owner.<br>  Each format follow a set of rules and legality/ restriction on which cards you can and can not include in your deck (banned cards) and which cards you can only use as a one of (restricted cards).<br>  <br>  *So what is standard?<br>  The Standard format uses only the newest sets the game has to offer. The current block, the block that was released the previous October, and the most recent core set are all legal to play in a Standard deck. As you can tell from the name, Standard is the most commonly played format. Standard events are available year round at retailers and tournament venues worldwide, offering new players a great opportunity to enjoy a tournament setting with the cards they've recently purchased.<br>  <br>  *Now what is block/ block constructed?<br>  The Block Constructed format uses only the cards from a single block of Magic sets. Block Constructed formats generally take their name from the first set in the block. For example, the Time Spiral, Planar Chaos, and Future Sight sets make up the Time Spiral block. The smaller card pool of Block Constructed poses an interesting challenge for players. It also provides an opportunity to enjoy the setting of one of the Multiverse's planes in a focused environment.<br>  <br>  Now for the banned and restricted list, i suggest you check it directly from magicthegathering.com because it changes regularly. <br>  check this link: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/banned" rel="nofollow">http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resourc...</a><br>  <br>  You can see standard and block under constructed formats.<br>  You should also check the date it was updated. I think they update it every quarter, though I'm not really sure.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|9KeaTUh6aa	Block and Standard are referring to two of the sanctioned MTG formats. <br>  <br>  In Block, short for Block Constructed, players build decks using only the cards from one specific block of sets, the sole exception being Lorwyn-Shadowmoor. Lorwyn-Shadowmoor is actually four sets instead of three, as the sets were released as two mini-blocks. Despite this, the format is played as usual.<br>  <br>  An example of a traditional three-set block would be Mirage Block, which consists of Mirage, Visions, and Weatherlight. The blocks are generally named after the first (and largest) set in the block. For example, Onslaught block is Onslaught, Legions, and Scourge. The blocks follow the same story in MTG lore: Urza's Saga, Urza's Legacy, and Urza's Destiny, known as Urza Block, all follow the planeswalker Urza.<br>  <br>  Standard is a slightly larger format. Standard encompasses the two most recent blocks (with Lorwyn-Shadowmoor counted as one) and the most recent Core Set (8th, 9th, 10th edition, etc.). Currently, Standard includes 10th Edition as its Core Set and Lorwyn-Shadowmoor and Shards of Alara blocks.<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad for being new. We all go through the learning pains. I used the think you could attack creatures when I started playing 12 years ago.

411e33cff378a28929963f21b85453abaa	well, I have been crocheting for over 30 years, and knitting for over 20.  They both have complicated pattersn ,but I ahve seen some knitted shawls that make me weep with beauty and when when I look at the patter, I am amazed at the complexity of it.  Crochet: one hook.  knitting: two sticks.  Knitting is,to me, far more complicated than crocheting, but I am told by crocheters that knitting is harder.  Depends on who teaches you and what you want to learn.  I was taught when I was 8 how to crochet,and how to knit when I was 18. I learned to knit by force. My craft teacher didn't know how to crochet,and she didn't wanna learn yet. She also didn't want me to do something I already knew.   I learned to make a bell. With a jingle-bell clapper.  I still love that pattern.  I have yet to knit a scarf.  I have knitted potholders,baby sweaters,baby blankets,baby hats,berets,and sweaters,and skirts, ( my current pattern,I made up,and took from a knitted pattern online.I just tweaked it a little.  :)   )  and if you ar learning to knit, get a set of three short needles, or just one pair of short ones.   Long needles are harder to learn on, because of the length,and then you'll get frustrated,and quit.  Not a good idea.  Oh,and don't do a scarf. You'll get bored. And quit.   a great site to elarn from is Knit pattern central.   Oh,and about.com, knitting.  i go to crochet pattern central alot, and I mean alooooot.  I also go to Knit pattern central.   I have them both bookmarked.    It depends on what you are trying to learn.and what you wanna do.My first pattern,was a beret,and I wanted to make it,so i forced myself to learn,when i was sick,no less,and couldn't concentrate, but I wanted to make it.  My aunt was staying with us at the time and helped me read the pattern and "decipher" it.    And yes,I still have that pattern!     Crocheters run in out family,my mom,gramma,auntie and me.  My oldest daughter tried to learn and nearly poked her eye out.  i am not kidding!  ( it's funny,now,that I look back on it! lol)   good luck and have fun.|`|M9FQSKRwaa	here is a great site to teach you the basics    http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/cast-... http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/knit-...  http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/purl-...  http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/casti...|`|1AZ6SCQnaa	i would say crochet is easier as it is quicker to make a garment|`|AA12343169	If you want to learn to knit, then you should learn to knit. It is not difficult, it is relaxing, and at the end of it, you have something to show for your trouble.  Crochet is also easy. the difference is that crocheting is faster, as the stitches are taller. the fabric can be denser, however. Crochet also uses more yarn than knitting for a comparably sized project.  I do both, and enjoy them for the different looks I get for each project. When I am in a hurry I crochet, when I can take my time, I knit.|`|XLVaGmkeaa	I've learned and stuck to knitting for several years. I've tried crocheting and I've never gotten the hang of it. It's just not my cup of tea, per se.|`|YB72BLdWaa	I'm going to agree with most of the answers here - it depends on what you learn first.  I started crocheting when I was 7 years old.  When I decided to learn to knit, I could not for the life of me figure it out.  How did you get the yarn on the needle?  Beating the ball of yarn with the stick didn't help at all.  About 10 years later, I sat down with a SNB book and took some serious time figuring it out.  Granted, it did take me a few weeks before I understood what I was doing without dropping a ton of stitches, but I eventually got it.  Now I knit almost exclusively (except for afghans, I usually crochet those), and have even gone on to spinning my own yarn :)|`|DfIEgDbAaa	A lot of people consider crocheting easier because you only have one stick in your hands.  That is why I find it harder.  The second needle in knitting holds your stitches where they are supposed to be & keeps them from falling out if you are a loose knitter.  I taught myself to knit & figured learning how to crochet would be useful, also.  It has been 3 years & I still can't figure it out.  I do all kinds of knitting, straight, round, short rows, it really doesn't matter.  Anything you can do in crochet, you can do in knitting & vice versa.  It really is a personal choice.|`|154dzJ1Faa	Is one easier than the other?  Yes.    It all depends on what you learn first.  Either one can be hard the first time you try it, because your hands just don't know what to do.  But after a few sessions, they learn, and you are on your way.  Both require pulling a loop through another loop -- and what's hard about that!?    Some just like the look of one over the other.  Neither one is better than the other (although there is no question that one is better looking than the other!) and each has some advantages and disadvantages.  You need to decide.    I would say to try both.  Give each a good try, so you are familiar with them both.  There are times that you will require the other one in your work, and it sure is handy if you have the basics.  Then no project will stop you because "I don't knit/crochet" -- anyone can do them, if they apply themselves.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Which is easiest seems to depend on the person and which they learned first.    I learned crochet first and find it a lot easier than knitting. However, there are really only 2 stitches to learn in knitting.    You must toss a coin or something to decide which you wish to learn first! Then go on to learn to be a great fiber artist in all things fiberholics like to do.|`|PBTgiffqaa	I crochet and have no idea how to knit but my mom used to knit and she told me that crocheting is easier.

oIz9HYaraa	No, you cant just stick to Warrior. At level 18, you can unlock your subjob. A subjob make your main job even more powerful.    For warrior, the starter jobs that are good for warrior are monk and thf. Samurai and Ninja are great as advanced sub jobs for warrior (can be unlocked at 30).    Your not going to get any invites after around level 20 if you dont have a subjob, because anyone else with a subjob will be more powerful than you. After youve leveled a subjob up to 37, then you could just take warrior to 75. But you NEED a subjob if you expect to get invites after level 20.

QPVcRNI4aa	well im not so sure what the first person said,(magic the gathering), but you definitely would be more effective using a multiple or two. and call of the mummy helps get those high levels out your hand and to use. the zombie world would be better if you didn't have non zombie tributes. book of life is also good in multiples at least a monster reborn. I think its mostly the viruses that hold the deck together. Overall ill rate it a 8.36/10|`|evB63qWvaa	It's not bad, but in my opinion, you have too little of one thing.  If you're building the deck to make sure it works off of other cards, you will better your chances of getting those cards with the maximum of 4 in your deck.  Also, some ideas on other zombies, you might want to look into Gempalm Polluters, Shepherds of Rot, and Noxious Zombies.  Also, Call to the grave is very nice since it only forces everyone to sacrifice non zombie creatures.  If your creatures are all zombies, in theory, you could wipe all your opponents creatures out and you have all yours left on the board.  5/10|`|qXsbRsiXaa	i Like this deck but it could be better. I'd add another zombie world just because of how much it locks opponents down.There are a couple of other changes i would make but you said this deck works for you so I'd give it a 8 out of 10. And yeah the first guy is way off like what is he talking about?

2Q2ltt1Saa	Not really.<br>  <br>  Game testers 'play' games, but they don't in the sense you're thinking/hoping.  They play the same sections/levels/etc. over and over again, trying things differently each time to chekc for bugs; it's not sitting down in front of a TV and playing Halo 3 until you go home.<br>  <br>  This also requires a lot of experience- there ar emillions of people that think the video game industry is just this, and probably 1/4 of them go to school for programming or other fields in hopes of getting a career in this field.  The number of people that do the work and receive the reward is minimal at best, though.|`|cEgzOJgqaa	Yea its called being a game tester. but you would have to go to collage and getting a job for game testing is qutie difficult nowadays so dont get your hopes up im also going into this carrer and it takes plenty of collage trust me|`|qJJW4AQ2aa	Game Tester. It is not easy to get into the profession because only about 10% make it into the industry. It is not all fun and games though, because you have to find bugs in the games and write detailed reports about where it is and what you did to get the bug. You spend about 50% of the time testing and the other 50% on writing reports and finding bugs in games. It can be hard, but it can be rewarding to see the game that you tested is on the shelves at a store near you.

cLW7vFUGaa	Try Jin! He should hint you toward a "seedling" near the lighthouse... but unfortunately, when you go to plant it, you'll find out that it isn't THE seedling. Still, you have to go through the process in order to get the opportunity to eventually seek out the real one. Next you've got to try Calvin's theory about a strange seedling he found in the mine, which will also fail (you'll get the story about what it really was). After that, Gill and everyone else in town will start talking about how the Mayor has been uncharacteristically hitting the bar in Sundae Inn on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday nights, mumbling mysterious things... and THAT'S where you get the information that will allow the real search to begin.

That's a good question. Are you at the part where you meet Cyrus @ Mt. Coronet? Then you can use Palkia. It has great speed AND special attack. Other than that, Buizel is great. It has awesome speed and it can be trained pretty easily so it can evolve into Floatzel. Buizel also has fine special attack if the nature is neutral (125-213) and if it has a beneficial nature (137-240). You can find it on:<br>  <br>  Route 205<br>  Route 213<br>  Route 224<br>  Valley Windworks.|`|psKx7NF8aa	Switch to Dungeons & Dragons and I could help you out.

jvuW18wvaa	Pricing for items is variable, depending on location, quality and need, so it'd difficult to give an exact cost.  What I Can do is give info, then it's up to you to "full in the blanks"...    For a board, the easiest thing is to "cannibalize" an old game that's not being used. Go check out your local resale shops (Goodwill, Salvation Army) or garage sales. You can usually find board games very inexpensive - only a couple of dollars max. Trivial Pursuit, Monopoly, Sorry are all good ones to use.    Use the board, but make some changes in the appearance - custom graphics, etc. Use the existing playing pieces cuz you'll need pieces. I have a friend who is a game designer, and for game cards he uses the computer packets of business cards that you can purchase from office supply stores.Like these from Office Depot:  * Avery? Laser Clean-Edge Business Cards, 2" x 3 1/2", White, Pack Of 200 Cards @ $14.49  http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/26...    You could also use regular playing cards, but you'd probably want to change the faces for your needs.    I'd Definitely suggest that you check out BoardGameGeek (aka BGG, aka "The Geek"). BGG is simply The Best Online Resource for Game Info. Their datebase is Huge, and there are many great features to utilize - like reviews, sessions reports, photos and forums. You will have the experience and knowledge of many Members on your behalf.  http://www.boardgamegeek.com    The BoardGameGeek Wiki is Amazing!

Since the monster isn't sent to the gaveyard its effect doesn't activate.    Since I noticed you may be running a DARK Deck, here are some cards that DON'T mix with Marcos Cosmos:  Newdoria  Kuriboh  Sangan  Dark Crusader  Mystic Tomato  Monster Reincarnation  Red Eyes Zombie Dragon  Colossal Fighter  Any Dark World monster  Chthonian Soldier  Phantom pf Chaos  Dark Eruption  Des Feral Imp  In some cases Armageddon Knight  Birthright  and many more.    Also for anyone who doesn't believe me, their effects don't activate until the monster hit the graveyard; Which won't happen with Macros Cosmos on the field.
MK5Ddtiiaa	I am not sure if there are any colleges that can help you with that. Ask your guidance counselor as they are most likely going to tell you how to go about this. They can help you with your college process that is tedious but they know all about it. Ask your teachers as well, most likely your gymnast teacher. Someone should understand what you want and need. Good luck!|`|d60972a141a0ece3ed840882b5123229aa	there are different aspects of the circus that you can join. when you talk about a large circus like Ringling Bros, they have an entire corporate level. then there are the actual troops that tour and perform. within them are animal handlers, clowns, musicians, support staff (audio techs, light techs, etc) as well as the other performers and announcer. what aspect of that would you enjoy? if you want to be a clown, learning to juggle could come in handy just remember that you will spend most of your time on the road. most circus families are that because that is all they are around and the only persons they will meet.
e2mAJAK6aa	papermache made from old newspapers is fun and cheap.  Make a paste using flour and water. Mix one part flour with about 2 parts of water until you get a consistency like thick glue. Add more water or flour as necessary. Mix well to get out all the bumps. Add a few tablespoons of salt to help prevent mold.  Or, you can use white school glue mixed with a bit of water. Mix using about 1 part water with 2 parts glue.  Tear strips of newspaper about an inch wide, dip in paste and lay over a mold.  Let dry for 24 hours and then do more strips let dry again for 24 hours and then another layer of strips.  It takes at least 3 layers to make a good base.  You can use balloons to make round shapes or anything you want to mold.  Let dry completely then using tempura paints, paint your designs on them.|`|2R1H8B8taa	Getting felt at a store is relatively cheap! They usually have the little sheets for about 25 cents each.

Near the tables where the pattern catalogs are, will be filing cabinets with the pattern company names and numbers.  Find your pattern.    Do not go by the size you buy in RTW (ready to wear), but the measurements on the back of the pattern envelope.

cDjWONryaa	As you see in the last sentence it says if it was folded as a result of false information given to a player.  In your case you assumed the other player was out therefore you were at fault for the improper action and therefore you folded your hand.  Anytime you cards or chips pass the line of betting it is a action that is and you should be held accountable for it.|`|RfbpvqSWaa	Just because you tried to muck the hand does not mean it is dead.  You can retrieve your hand before it hits the muck (dead cards).|`|fz2woMMTaa	having dealt the game as a profession for years you can fold your own hand.    however your situation if different, if the cards had touched the "dirt" then it is dead, and i am sure you can see the reasons why, if however they don't your hand is still live provided that no-one objects.    in your case it looks like someone objected so the rule is the hand is dead. the objector has to be involved in the game but not necessarily in the hand.    not very sporting but there's always one!|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Since it was pre flop,   its what they call "Folding out of turn".    You made a bet,  and it was called.   Therefore,  theres still action in the hand.   You threw your hand in (over the line) before the turn.   This would be considered as a fold as soon as your turn to act came around,   and the hand is done.       You could ask management,   but they would likely tell you that you have to pay more attention to the game.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	wel from the sound of it your cards was tossed face down to the dealer meaning you folded.. a lesson here is to make sure you pay attention to what is going on..the dealer should also pay attention to what is going on laso becuase the dealer should of said the hand is stil live because there was a bet..|`|GgBdQqrdaa	the RULE is that if your cards are thrown then they are mucked aka folded. you are SUPPOSED to flip them over in front of you. noticed pros flip them over nicely..

NWYdIIMHaa	You can use the computer to design as already suggested.    If you want you can do a soft lamination. Scotch as in the scotch tape brand has sheets that you can purchase at office supply stores then just purchase pin backs and glue those on.    If you know someone who is into scrapbooking or paper crafting they may have Xyron machine which does soft lamination. The one I have can do a sheet up to 12" wide. This company also sells sheets for the machine that are lamination on one side and adhesive on the other. You might want to check with stamp or scrapbook stores in your area as they might have one you could use for a fee.    Another alternative is do use the lamination but instead of a pin back you could use a hole punch and string yarn through the hole so the badge can be worn around the neck.    If you have an Office Max or Office Depot in your area they are also be able to laminate the badges for you.    Hope this helps!|`|Ovj7Nf25aa	Create them using "MS Word" and "PowerPoint", then save them as JPEG.

I purchase them from our coordinator whenever I want to gather autographs of professional bowlers I bowl with in PBA regional or National tournaments.    For used bowling pins, I just ask our lead mechanic to see if there are any used, but good condition pins that he can spare.

dvkWQvfDaa	yup, mostly shooters, but there are more games though  other than sports, i'd suggest    Mirror's Edge (it's a 1st person adventure game. you can beat the game by stealing weapons from the enemies and killing them - turning the game into a shooter - or you can play it on a stealth style, so you hide from the enemy without killing a single one and try to reach your goal)    Mass Effect, Gears of War 1 and 2 and all 3rd person shooters (Mass Effect has some RPG features)    Assassin's Creed is an adventure game    I'm not sure if there are Prince of Persia games on 360, but they are amazing.    Fable 1 and 2 are adventure/rpg games. you turn your character into anything you want (evil or good, magician or warrior, married/pets or lonely, among other stuff). it gets fun and you can beat it various times, becoming the opposite of what you became the previous time, or a mixture of them.|`|OJHO52UJaa	back out, PS3 has more third person games, has all the sports games that 360 has, has better graphics and graphics potential, blu-ray player not just hi def, and has the Jap game influences as well such as the incredible metal gear series|`|lFsfDqPqaa	no, u should definantly buy it.

j98CkMzVaa	You have to go to the pottery shop in the desert near the scorpions and bank. Get the items and craft. Start with cow hides tan them in the desert place get a needle and thread and you can make chaps coifs etc. Good way to make money i had 60 something crafting made loads. I don't play the game anymore it kinda takes over your life play it in moderation.  For specific pottery items follow this guideline:  Pottery making is a great way to begin crafting because it gives a nice amount of experience and it's fairly straightforward. Its main purpose is to help you with cooking, since the things you make with it are used to hold ingredients.  First, mine some Clay from the west Varrock mine, and buy a jug from any local General Store. Fill it with water from a sink or fountain, and use it with the clay to create some Soft Clay. Head to the Barbarian Village, and use the soft clay with a Pottery Wheel inside one of the houses. Now use the pottery with the Pottery Oven to bake it into a useable item.  item:crafting level:xp.

Use the soft clay on a pottery wheel, such as the one in Barbarian village.  Then use it on a pottery oven, again you can use the one in Barbarian village.    But it's not worth making since it gives very little exp and the product is useless, like a pot or a bowl so it's just a waste of time.|`|ZWfPSlu7aa	Ask Brad|`|lkm7qgYqaa	http://runescape.salmoneus.net/crafting....

CNZn1qhJaa	Fallout 3.    Most games I play (Halo, Call of Duty, Gears of War, Bioshock...mostly FPS) seem so constricted.     I love Fallout 3. You can customize everything like your appearance, your strengths, your weaknesses...    And there is so much to do. When you talk to people, it actually let's you choose what you want to say. It's awesome.    It's only one-person, so you can't play it on Live.    It's so much fun though.    There's this Kharma thing. You can choose to be good or bad...lol my karma is really bad -- Evil Fatcat...it's the worst you can get on karma..    but anyways im rambling but if you get a game, get Fallout 3!!    You won't be sorry!|`|M0BJgvx6aa	If you like grand theft auto you would like The Scarface Game, i actually don't care too much for the Grand Theft Auto games but the Scarface is really good, especially if your a Scarface fan. Family guy game is kinda good, bit repetitive tho. The Simpsons Game is fun, Destroy All Humans is about it aliens coming to earth, you can use your jet pack to get a around, do alot of cool stuff do people with different weapons, and my favorite you can fly your UFO around town and stuff!|`|9YTIwgIZaa	Call Of Duty World At War, Halo 3, Gears Of War, Mario Kart WII            I prefer Call OF Duty cuz it's online and extremly good graphics.  Second Halo 3                     System:                    Wii                    X-Box 360                     PS3|`|68QSpCVFaa	guitar hero its expensive but soooooooooo fun. u cant get it for xbox360 and wii as far as i know i think you can also get it 4 playstation 2.|`|9vP8dB11aa	GTA series and other Open ended games...reason I like it? Open ended...gotta love them. I also like games that are easily modded such as Counter Strike or GTA.

Such as to use search engine sites, like this one.|`|rJypD0flaa	it really depends on what you like. My best suggestion is to visit the following link and you can do your own research and search by specifics to find the best game for you!    The link is http://www.mpogd.com/    I found this site when I wanted to vote for the best game of the month and this site is one of the most popular for that.    Good luck in finding what you like!

pp5dhbIoaa	She is actually wearing a corset "stays" and a capped sleeve chemise and petticoat.Which is what is worn under the gown. You might have to kinda put separate patterns together to make it. Here is one that might work for the corset.  http://www.butterick.com/item/B4254.htm?...  And maybe for the chemise..  http://simplicity.com/dv1_v4.cfm?design=...  Fabric choice is the key to make the "look"    Here are also some patterns that might work if modified.  http://patternsoftime.com/proddetail.asp...    http://patternsoftime.com/proddetail.asp...
356cfec15f8450218c5dff174ffe1d5aaa	We have similar tastes, great games there.    I really enjoyed Dead Space, the atmosphere in that game is just incredible.  Turn down the lights, and play with head phones on!  I've played through it twice now and I never do that with games.    Fear 2 is coming soon, the demo is pretty sweet and you can download it now.  Resident Evil 5 is out soon aswell.|`|3eQhA8nraa	based on the fact that you like shooters, i must recommend the ever so recommended call of duty franchise. i find that the tank controls clunky for world at war, and in modern warfare there are no drivable vehicles.    i must also recommend battlefield bad company, while it lacks in customizable guns, it makes up for in the fact that all but a buildings supporting walls can be destroyed, you can drive vehicles, and the controls are as responsive (for vehicle size) as in most racing games. sure there are moments of wtf  (such as the noob toob only does 90 damage but can destroy a wall), but its a great game that can be bought for around $40 new.    and you should definitely get the demo for dead space, if your into horror. i haven't tried the whole game.|`|CNZn1qhJaa	I less than three all of those games...    You should get Halo Wars...when it comes out...that's all I can think of...|`|vLXXkZGLaa	call of duty 4    WAW sucks|`|CaZcVC4laa	Cod 4 or 5|`|mvu0yrF8aa	get GoW2, RS4, GTA4, CoD4 or 5, Madden 09|`|m77Fa4HCaa	Rainbow six vegas 2, it has unlockable things in multiplayer, has a ranking system on both online and off and it is a good third person shooter with the ability to customize your character and it also has a sick cover system|`|VMomFr80aa	You might like Far Cry 2. Its a pretty good game. Its an Fps with great visuals and pretty good game play. I would also recommend Call of Duty World at War. Good story and can't go wrong if you like online play. And My final recommendation is GTA4. I think it is the best game out for 360. I got it when it first came out and i still play it to this day.
qbzen2XYaa	OK, you downloaded the trial version.  The Trial version is actually the REAL game just that because your in trial status, a lot of things are disabled.    So... Go to the World of Warcraft Website.    You are going to PURCHASE a CD KEY to upgrade your world of Warcraft game to REGULAR status.    This also gives you a FREE MONTH of gaming time.  So.. when you figure it out, you are only paying 5 bucks for the Game, and your still spending the 14.99 for the month of playing time.    the 19.99 charge is the First month fee, to upgrade your account and for playing time.  After that it should only be 14.99 a month, or 29.99 for a game card every 2 months or 60 days.    Disregard any friend requests.  Anyone that has been playign this game any amount of time is probably already a level 80 character, and they simply want you to join on their behalf.  If you play the game, and pay for a month, they also get a month free once you become a member and subscribe.  They don't want to help you level, they just want you to "pay" for them to play.    This Albert guy that posted an answer has posted 10 other messages ive seen so far today all with recruit a friend info.  Sooner or later after asking 100 people a day, odds are he'll get 1 person to bite, and after 30 days, when that person pays for more online time, he also gets a month.  Sooner or later, he'll have a year or 2 worth of time saved up..    It's his way to scam using this for his own benefit.|`|MyqOdACOaa	allrigth first go out to ebgames or any other game store and buy it for 30 bucks and u get 2 months so yes it is 15 bucks a month     but lemmie send you an invite to play world of warcraft let me explain if i send you an invite to your email for you to create an account for world of warcraft we both get triple experience in the game and also i personally will give you 20gold to start off with your really not losing anything your just gaining all you have to do once you get the invite is accept it and then create your account when you buy the real game keep the same account and just enter the authentication key if you have more question leave a comment or leave some form of contact i would be highly grateful email me at albert_alar@hotmail.com     down side is u need to make another account but w/e i can get u to 60 in 3 days     they charge u more on the internet because u don't have to go out an buy it its faster    just check the website Worldofwarcraft.com if u don't believe me trust me its possible and i really need a RAF buddy to lvl to 60 super fast    check ur email for more info
dmCVyBO0aa	wanna try something a bit difficult? try  Gunz by ijji. its a very fast paced game. its pretty fun. but takes alot of time to get good at. i played for 1 year. then a switched to wow and have played it ever since. well good luck. :)
eGpOIV12aa	have you tried downloading the latest updates? need the latest patch      do you have it on a computer with vista? compatiblity problems    is the resolution correct? set to high or to low    sounds like the resolution is likely the problem
012c00f3aed6127a6a10506a53fbc105aa	If I were you, I'd take that Belkin right back to the store and pick up a Linksys. I've heard from many people that they can't get online with their PS3 because of the Belkin router. However, if you pick up a Linksys, I can help you.    My email is: bigwill11205@yahoo.com
GqHHVzf0aa	I copied this from a HM site:  Wood Fish - You can't catch this fish until 1) You have received the Rainbow Recipe from Alan, and 2) You have to complete Ben and Daren's recipes. The fish can be found in the Harvest Goddess' pond in any season, between 7:00 pm and 5:00 am. It is very rare, so you just have to be patient and keep trying.    If you want to stay at the pond until the next morning, try to bring some Stay Awake or Super Stay Awake with you. The potions will ward off the drowsiness that occurs once you've been awake past 6:00 am. If you don't have the potions you will be stuck at a slow-walking pace and have to drag yourself back home to sleep. You can buy the potions from Irene at the Meringue Clinic for 375 G and 525 G.    This is the site i got it from, it also has all the rainbow recipies:  http://www.fogu.com/hm/index.php  Also, if you have any other questions here's a really awesome walkthrough:  http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/wii/file...  Sorry this is really long!  Good luck!|`|r2FHUfofaa	First, make sure your at level 3 while you fish.  It won't appear for anything less than that.  You don't have to go higher but it won't hurt either.   Second, get a gold fishing rod.  You can find all of the metals in the mine.  Just smash up rocks and look for any ore that's sparkling.  That should help you catch the Wood Fish.    And you can milk a cow once a day.
9vP8dB11aa	Beer is a food item found in Fallout 3. It has an effect on your stats, but is addictive.    In Fallout 3, it adds +1 to your strength, which is another 10 pounds or so of items you can carry when Fast Traveling.     Can't wait till I get this game but I got the thing from http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_Wi...|`|MYstdIMbaa	"Beer is a food item found in Fallout 3.

3IS5oGgBaa	Yes of course you can. All you need is an ethernet cable... buy one at gamestop. Then turn on your xbox and there you go!|`|Uo0thZGqaa	yes i did this. if it is a vista laptop this should work . connect the ethernet cable to the xbox and the laptop. then go to network and sharing center on the computer . look for manage network connections on the left. open that and right-click on your broadband connection. look at properties and go to sharing. tick the box that says you allow other users to connect through the laptop. hope this works. it did for me. if it does plz tell me cause id like to know.
