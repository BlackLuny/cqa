Cuánto falta para que todos noten    que pueden co-existir millones y millones de Universos    en este mismo instante transparente?   Cuánto falta para nos hagamos cargo de que al fin y al cabo   ES POSIBLE VIVIR EN PAZ?      Y cuánto falta para que la gente deje de actuar "COMO LA GENTE"    y decida explorar sus libertades a toda costa y sin más ley que UN SUE?O?      Cuánto falta para que se materialicen    las alas peregrinas de los sue?os verídicos que INTENTO?   Cuánto falta para emprender un vuelo TODOS JUNTOS?   Cuánto falta, eruditos??? Cuánto falta???   Una vida?   Dos? Tres? Cientos? Millones?      (si no existiera el TIEMPO...   Si no fuera el verdugo de los días   que habito, que madrugo,    que trasnocho y que enciendo,   diría que no falta...    y que ya es cierto!...)

20071110201231AAkppAa	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	What would be a good sealant for a glass tank designed to hold isopropyl alcohol?	Hello,      I am a student working on a permanent diffusion cloud chamber. I have everything working so far except for the type of sealant. The chamber is filled with 99%+ isopropyl alcohol vapor which has started corroding my acrylic tank and adhesive over the course of a few weeks.   I'm planning to switch to a glass tank but have not been able to source a good sealant that would be resistant to the alcohol over long term exposure. There seems to be mixed opinions about the combination of silicone and isopropyl and so far I have found no data covering long exposure periods.      Does anyone have any suggestions on something that might work for this?      thanks   -b

I have just received a message from a friend on yahoo messenger, saying the following. If you pour the oil in which you previously fried some stuff, it can have really bad consequences. Such as making the water into which it flows undrinkable. Such a great amount is made undrinkable, that it would be enough for a person for 14 years. I do not exactly know how this whole thing goes, it sounds to me more like a think to say to shocking others. Oil actually shouldn't even get mixed with water...as it floats on water. Does hot oil behave differently? What have you read on the internet? Have you got any links that could sustain or contradict this idea?

20090305034424AAY2C7p	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	What do you think...?	What do you think the population of "2012 world ending believers" is?      My rough estimate is around 140 000 believers in the world.      I Googled this: "2012 end world site:answers.yahoo.com" so that it will filter questions asked here. It came up with 28 800 results!      Say for example the 1st question was asked about a year ago. That is a staggering rate of ~80 questions about 2012 / day.      21st December 2012 is roughly 1387 days from now.      80 x 1387 + 28 800 = ~140 000 believers assuming 1 question asked per believer.      This is a VERY approximate number, under many assumptions. Do you think this is a close value? What should it be?

I know a few sites that will let me torrent some of the books, but I don't want to do anything illegal. If I have to, I'll order the damn books and pay what I'm sure will be a ridiculous price for some very old books. However, I'd much rather download them all immediately and for free if it's legal.      Also, I know I would have to study other books on category theory in addition to the Bourbaki books to get a good general foundational knowledge of modern mathematics. Are there any other significant topics the Bourbaki books are weak in or don't cover which I'll have to supplement? I'm the kind of guy who prefers independent self-study over classroom lectures, so I'm always open to suggestions for good books (not just math).

20090305041110AAFO92z	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Parapsychology	I think I am psychic?	So the past few years I am convinced that I have developed some sort of sixth sense type thing. But the thing of it is, I can't really control it.      For example, I randomly think of a song that I hadn't heard in a long time. I don't know why I just thought of that song but I just did. Then later that day I hear the song in a commercial.       You can call that a coincidence, its what I did when it happened, but then this **** just started happening way to much.      Let me give you another example just somewhat recently. I was on google earth, looking at Washington D.C. to see where the presidential inaguration of Obama was. So I was looking all around D.C., then I remembered about the airplane that crashed into that frozen river a while back. I don't know why I thought of THAT, but I did. So then later on I went up to New york city in google earth. I was looking around at the island, and noticed how similiar it was to the game Grand Theft Auto IV, etc.      Well can you guess what happend the next day? That airplane crashed into the freezing Hudson River. Like what the hell? You can't tell me that I just HAPPEN to be on google earth (for the first time in about a month), just HAPPEN to remember about that plane crashing in the frozen DC river, and just HAPPEN to be scouring NYC and then the next day this event takes place. There is no way in hell that can be a coincidence.      And the thing is, stuff like this has been happening all the time for me now. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to come on here and brag about how I think i'm psychic and you're not, I really just need some open minded people to give me some information on wtf is going on? At first I thought they were coincidences, then I thought they were weird. Then there was  a point where I started to get freaked out by how often they happened and I even started to write them down and keep track. But now it just happens so much that I almost don't give it a second thought...

20090305041013AAqDzc3	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Show that: no integer whose digits add up to 15 can be a square or a cube.?	Been working on this one for a while . . . doesn't seem to be true for an integer a^2.  Consider that a^2 = 0, 1, 4, or 7 (mod9).  Then suppose that the digits in a^2 sum to 15.  This means, for example, that 9 | a^2 - 7.  Well, suppose a^2 is an integer whose digits sum to 15 where the 2nd to last digit is between 1 and 9, and the last digit is a 1.  Then the sum of the digits would be 15 - 1 + 4 = 18.  But 9 | 18, so this seems to contradict what I am trying to prove.  Am I thinking about this correctly?

The AC motor needs to rotate from 0deg to 60deg in one direction and the rotate from -60deg to 60deg in another direction straight after the first motion is completed. Can this be done? So the motor would never complete a full circle rotation, also a stepper motor would not be suitable as the motion needs to be fast and the motor needs to be small and lightweight, and this program of motor motion would need to be programmed onto a chip.

20090305044500AA3B7s4	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics: In theory, will a ball bounce back to the same height it was dropped?	Say a ball is dropped from a height y. If the situation were perfectly elastic without any friction/air resistance, will the ball bounce back to y?      I tried to solve for this using the equations:   1/2 mv1^2 + mgy1 = 1/2 mv2^2 + mgy2   v^2 = v(o)^2 + 2gy      And I proved that it is so. I just wanna make sure..      ----      Also, if the same ball is put on top a more massive ball and dropped together, should the ball bounce higher? I believe so. And I also think that if their total mass is increased, the ball will also bounce higher.      Last question! Since the topmost ball bounces, will all the other balls below technically have zero velocity (stop)?      -----      Thanks a lot!! ^_^
