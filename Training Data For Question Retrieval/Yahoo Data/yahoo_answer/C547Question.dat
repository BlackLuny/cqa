I am on a huge diet/lifestyle change, but to begin with I'd like to shrink my stomach and get my food intake under control (I eat A LOT and I mean a lot, I eat 4-5 large meals a day), I have tried really hard to do it alone, but as soon as I start to feel bored or whatever I head for the fridge.      I want to take some appetite suppressants for the early days of my weight loss whilst I get to grips with the gym, but apart from ephedrine (which is not only dangerous but illegal) I don't know of any, does anyone else?

20090304123940AAR9mXA	Health;Mental Health	How to stop uncontrollable shaking during presentation?	Ok, so I get really nervous and anxious before and after I do any type of public speaking in front of the class at school.  So much so, that during the presentation, my hands shake uncontrollably and you can hear my nervousness through my voice.  And that is all I can think about, like I can't even focus on my actual presentation; I am more focused about what people think of me along with a major fear of saying something stupid or embarrassing myself.  I am a very self-conscious person, I am definitely the type to over-analyze things that are really no big deal.      I always tell myself that no one really cares, or pays attention, and that why should I even care what these people think in the first place.  But even so, I can't stop shaking and stuttering.  So, I was wondering, if there was anyway to prevent or stop shaking?  Maybe like take an Advil before the presentation to relax my muscles, I don't know!  I may even resort to something like alcohol, I just don't want to look like an idiot.      Help me please!

"Dilated left ventricle with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, estimated ejection fraction of less than 30.  There is global hypokinesis suggesting  this may be a non-ischemic cardiomyopathy."      This impression describes a 55 year old man, who 30 years ago, during appendectomy was described as having " uni-focal PVCs" of unknown etilology.      I understand the concepts of non-ischemic cardiomyapothy and the  of "unknown etiology."  I can't identify the abbreviation of (uni-focal)  PVCs- but I know it ain't "polyvinyl-chloride."      What are the typical treatment options?  It is my understanding that 75% of people with this cardiac presentation are dead within 5 years of the diagnosis.      Except for an incidence of heart failure on New Years's Eve, and then 3 weeks of terrible panic attacks that occurred only at night with me becoming hyperventilative, there were no symptoms.

I was curious as to what it was like to have c*m in the mouth, so I allowed him to let go when he peaked into my mouth.  Anyway, it was kinda awkward.  Here I was, with c*m in my mouth and I couldn't swallow because I was gonna throw up if I did.  But I heard that it was rude to spit it out.  Well, I had no other choice.  I was gagging and getting a really bad sweet taste in my mouth.  So I ran to the bathroom and spit it out into the sink.  Is this rude?

I noticed this a few days ago:       On the right side of my jaw, and the right side only, there is a round little ball-shaped "thing" in the line of my jaw. It isnt huge, but it isnt small, either. It's medium sized---But you cant see it from the outside. I can only feel it when I touch it. When I apply even the smallest amount of pressure to it, it moves. That's the wierd part. It moves all around my jaw when I touch it, and even sometimes when I dont touch it. It moves even to where my glands are. I told my parents about it and they felt it and said it was very odd. It's not a gland or anything like that. Im going to the doctor's to figure out what it is in a few days, but have any of you ever had this happen to you? If so, what is it?

After looking inside my eye, the doctor said that there was nothing wrong, and that the problem was in my brain..

I am 5'5 and weigh almost 300 lbs. I have PCOS (polycistic ovarian syndrom). I am beginning the Atkins diet next week. I was wondering if anyone had any advice, tips, or recipes. I have plenty of will power, so that's not really the problem. It's more because of my schedule. I go to school full time in the day, and work full time at night. The other little time that I have is spent doing other daily duties such as laundry, cleaning, bills, etc. Making time to cook is where my problem comes in. Fast food is simple and convenient. If it's not fast food, it's something easy like cereal, hot pockets, or microwaveable dinners. Any positive input is greatly appreciated and anticipated.       Note: Yes, I will be working out. I am joining a gym at my earliest financial convenience. Until then, I am utilizing the small workout facility at my apartment complex and riding my bike.       Thanks in advance!

Hi, about a year ago I went to donate blood and was told I couldn't because my haemoglobin was too low (8.4) I went to my doctor who without any further tests or questions put me on iron tablets. I took them and was happy with it not knowing what any of it actually meant. However, a year later I went back to donate blood to find it is not as low but still "too low" at 9.3. Again, my doctor has asked no questions or done no further tests and has put me on iron tablets. Maybe he is right but if I am honest he really isn't much help he has never spoken to me about the condition and so I am trying to gain further knowledge.      Blood count results:   BC - 4.1   RBC - 3.63   HCT- 0.279   MCV - 76.8   MCH - 25.5   MCHC - 33.3   RDW - 18.6   PLT - 220   MPV- 9.8      Thank you for your time it is very much appreciated and I apologise for the length of the message.

I also walk 3 miles on days I cannot run. Track season starts monday, so I will be running Track & Field soon.         Any estimate on how many calories I should be eating would be great. The online calorie calculators tell me I should have about 2500 ... would you agree with this?      Thank you for your time.

20090304062544AA4yTrq	Health;Mental Health	Ideas for working with a child with autism?	I am working as a behavior specialist and have had some experience in working with kids with autism. However, I recently started working with a 5 year old boy that is on the autism spectrum. I am going into his home and work with him there for a couple of hours. The main goal is to work on his social skills but I want to start getting to know him better and building a relationship by working with him one on one before I take him out in the community and maybe involve other children.    Do you have any ideas of what I can do with him? I already made a visual schedule for him with removable picture icons and introduced him to that. He is very much into video games and it is very hard to get him away from it without him getting upset.    I just need some ideas of how I can encourage him into other things than video games and I need some ideas of activities that I can do with him, that don't bore him. Ideas for sensory activities would be great too!   Thank you!

20090304143126AAOAKli	Health;Women's Health	Am I just really stressed, or could I actually be pregnant.?	Last month I missed my period and didn't really worry about it because I was extremely stressed out.  I had started having the same symptoms my brother had when he was diagnosed with chron's disease.  It made me think that I'd have to go through all of these surgeries and tests while I am at college.  And to think of having to keep up being a music major as a Junior, I was just basically thinking of taking off from school and taking care of myself.  Everything is still going on, and I have a lot of stress from my classes, and it hasn't yet came this month.  I'm not usually regular, and it's only 2 days late to when it "should" have come.  It has happened to me a few times before to miss my period because of stress, but never 2 months in a row.  Is it possible that the stress could still have that much of an impact on me even though I have figured some things out?  My fiance` and I are extremely careful about protected sex, and I can't think of any time where it would have been possible for me to get pregnant.  I'm just really worried, and I would go take a pregnancy test but I'm too scared to.  I'm also afraid that me worrying about being pregnant is causing me to stress and miss another period. I don't really know though.  Any help or commentary would be nice. Thanks!

I am about to go on a weeks vacation with my dad and brother in 2 days and I was wondering if I should get this checked out before I go.   Here's my problem:   Monday, I had anal sex with my boyfriend. We have done it a handful of times before so I didn't think any differently. Monday night, my butthole was a little sore, but it is usually better by the next morning. Tuesday morning when I woke up, it still hurt. I went to the bathroom and looked at it and it looks like my butthole is open even if I am not going poop. SO, I couldn't take a crap and the whole day and every time I tried to push it my butt felt really wierd, like there is something in there but it wont come out. It still looks like it is wide open, though.   I am worried because this is the second day in a row I haven't been able to poo and I have a 5 day vacation ahead of me and I am worried an stressed. My dad bought me some fiber pills but I didn't tell him what they were for and they haven't worked well. Do I need to get it checked out or should I wait it out? Help!   Category

20090304154619AAlGBdG	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	My cats and I are itching and scratching like crazy!?	I really hope this question falls upon the wise eyes      I rescued a feral kitten 5 months back, when I brought the kitten into   my home I was sure to wash her really well for any mites, dirt, and etc.   I noticed the kitten had an abnormal habit of licking and scratching herself ,   after a while it came to my attention she has bald spots, I did a little Q&A   research and came up with the best estimated guess that the problem she had   is ring worm.  I called  my friend that is a vet tech and discussed this with her, she   has offered solid pet advice for years, so this time she recommended  any    (athletes foot fungus)anti foot fungus cream. (note:yes some human remedies can   and will be used on animals, but NEVER use any human meds., ointments or etc. unless   advised from vet.) I took my friends advice and used this anti fungal cream on the kitten   and it helped clear up the bald patches and reduced the licking/itching as much she but   still continues to do it.... and now two other of my cats are itching and licking and now I'm itching.   After the first couple weeks of having the kitten I was itching a lot, but I thought the desire   to do so was in my head because of the cats constant licking and scratching.   Now I know this problem is bigger than the simple answer of ring worm and some anti fungal cream   solution.      I have done my research and I have come up with what sounds similar to what we have here but I'm not convinced it being scabies or some dander problem after fleas (yes the kitten had fleas when she first arrived, but I killed them and their eggs off quick)   Yesterday I took one of my cats into the vets (not kitten) because my cat has noticeable chunks of fur missing (not like the bald pink scale like sores the kitten had)   The vet offered NO help. She had no answers at all and she said was that the cat I brought in looked fine and that the missing chunks of fur could just be allergies ( even though none of us, not me nor my cats have ever had any signs of allergies the entire time I have had them. Other than the kitten, the rest of the cats I have had 5 yrs and then some) She said as far as the kitten goes she would have to see her and do an evaluation from there.  I tell the vet "but the kitten has no more bald spots and shows less signs or symptoms than my other two cats, the kitten has just the same ole scratch and lick repetitiveness" The vet simply replies "it could be an array of things just bring her in".    I feel a better vet would have or at least could have given me a better answer or a list of different things it could be, or any type of possible attempt of a solution         Please if anyone who knows anything about this, please help.   My last resort is to spend even more money at the Dr.s and might end me up with me still scratching my head (pun intended) in wonder of what's really going on.   foot note: The sensation of itching I feel is like microscopic sharp little bites   extra note: I keep myself and my home very clean

A friend of mine got into a fight last Thursday well i didnt know this but he didnt show up to skool on friday. On Monday he came to school with blood all in the left side of his eye. Its REALLY unnattractive and scary but now its almost a week from then and the blood only seems to be getting  worse. I mean, it IN HIS EYE and hes tryna be all tough and macho like " naww i dont have to go to a doctor, im fine, im fine, itll go away" even if its not harmful its pretty scary. I had an eye problem and i know that the eye heals INCREDIBLY fast but not him, it has not cleared up at all. I would hate for something bad to happen to his eye.      My mom says that its not an eye problem and that it could be a hemmerage it the back of his head or if it is an eye problem that he could get blood poisoning cuz it has been exposed to air so long, then that definately wont be cute if he has to get his eye out. So right now he's letting his ego get the best of him so i'm just gonna try and find out as much as i can.         If u know whats wrong with his eye like why it had this reaction to the blow could u tell me or tell me what to do :] Thank You so much!

He gave me some light anxiety pills/anti depressents which didnt help much. I stopped smoking weed, and for about a week i was ok... then i started again thinking maybe it was just a phase or something or a bad strain of weed.. but now i feel really weird again. however, its different from before. last time i couldnt even look myself in the mirror because i didnt feel real... this time its not like that, its just very weird..i feel high, and very tired all the time like all i wanna do is sleep, and i feel like i just cant deal with anything, and its always on my mind..i cant stop thinking about it.

20090304084656AAMKDvb	Health;Mental Health	Stress and anxiety, Can anyone help?	Im almost 16, male   Basically, this is a bit of a weird one   Through my life i have experienced a lot of stress, anxiety and put downs at home and at school along with the usually work related stress everyone goes through      The main trouble is, because its been my whole life and i was brought up with it i don't understand what a less stressful life is like and cant tell weather my life is actually that bad.   I think i may have some stress and anxiety psychological problem   i have a very low self esteem and find it hard to mix with even my friends. Yet at the same time i can go up in front of an audience easily and play in my band and in shows.    I put on a 'character' and act very different from when im at at school, at home and on my own. I think im also dyslexic. I have conversations under my breath when im in bed before i fall asleep, playing both people envolved and often hear voices just as im falling asleep, i have what i think might be nervous breakdowns or something and am generally very low alot of the time. However my family and friends have no idea, no-one does, because i have always played this character and that is who they know me as, they all think im happy. I'm petrified of the number 13 and often do something and have to 'undo' it because i think it will give me bad luck.   However i still seem to be very motivated, i get up every morning determind to make today a good day.      I have asked on here for any help because i don't want to speak to anyone about it in person   Could people give their opinions, personal expreience and help?
20090304103136AA0BrM1	Health;Diet & Fitness	What is a good fintess plan?	I have decided to try and lose weight and get into shape. I currently weight in at 205lbs with 68" tall and a 24.3% body fat. I would like to try and get down around 180 which is the prime weight for my height.   I have recently started eating more sandwiches instead of fast food. I have stopped drinking soda and switched over to gatorade and sun tea.   my biggest problem is that I do not have a gym membership nor can i afford one. I have a single set of 20lbs dumbells and thats it. so any help on better diet or workouts that I could do at home or without use of equipment would be very helpfull.      Thanks,    Bobby C.

Today the juniors and seniors only had to go to school until 9 so i am home alone for a little while. This is what i had for lunch:      -1 slice Light Style Extra Fiber bread (lightly toasted, 40 calories per slice, 9 grams carbs per slice, no fat)   -1/4 cup chicken salad (1/2 teaspoon light mayo, 1/2 can chicken--35 calories, 98% fat free, 2 grams carbs, 1 tsp curry powder)   -1 sugar-free peach Jello cup (10 calories, no carbs)   -2 large strawberries, chopped (idk, about 10 calories?)   -1 tbsp ambrosia trail mix (a mix of almonds, dried cranberries and raisins--43 calories, 5 grams carbs)   -1/3 cup rinsed black beans (74 calories, no fat, 12) grams carbs      So in total, about 28 grams of carbs (not sure about the whole net carbs thing where you subtract the amount of fiber, otherwise it would be about 20 grams carbs) and 217 calories.      Does this sound healthy? Or did i eat way too much?

20090304143132AAAZ5TO	Health;Mental Health	Anyway to get rid of this depression?	Alright, so here's my story:      I've always been in a state of depressions, ever since the 7th grade (I'm in 11th atm) and it has been continuous, even right now i suffer from it. The following is a list from my whole life that have contributed to my depression over the years:      1. Bullied (not that much anymore)   2. Being the "third wheel" in social-related things   3. Been lonely for a long time   4. My parents are rough   5. School   6. After school activitied (chess, running)   7. Yesterday, i had to help my sister (4th grade) do a quiz over fractions and she ended up failing. She kinda rubbed it in my face and i feel like S**t because i screwed up.   8. I could never seem to stand up for myself because I'm very submissive.   9. Sometimes, I've thought about suicide because this life is too boring, really sucks, and it feels like if i just tried to bear with life, it'll take me no where.      Basically all that for 5 years and 5 years of bottling up my emotions.      ***The real question here is how can I help myself get out of this depression by just doing it myself? (for example, no doctors, no medications)***

Okay, so earlier today, I was eating a bowl of ramen noddles, rather salty, and while I was drinking the juice, I suddenly felt my heart beating very fast.   It was up to 120 per minute.   And this caused me to have a panic attack. (I suffer of an anxiety disorder).   Could it be only related to my anxiety disorder or something else? I've never felt this while eating.   Yesterday, I went to the doctor, and he told me I was fine, he took my blood pressure and all...

20090304125454AAXiMsF	Health;Other - Health	What can happen to me?	I feel like my mother is making me mental and emotional mess.  I don't really know where to start, so I'll start with something I realized a few weeks a go. I noticed that anytime I have a prob. she pretends she has the same one and I think she is doing it for attention. Like I went to the dermatologist & he told me I had eczema,that was about a year ago. So my mother was asking me a few weeks ago where my medication for it was because her skin was itching. I told her that I could'nt find it(truth) but that the medication was'nt for that but she went out anyway and refilled the perscription when I told her not to. So she uses my medication for herself. I have always told my mother that she was a hypochondriac because she is always claiming that she is sick in some way or another.      But today I had a complete breakdown and I have been going through a depression lately. It effects me going to school, feeling happy.   So anyway I told my mother this for the first time this morning before I was supposed to go to school and I could tell she felt sorry for me. So I told her to just leave because she is always saying that I make her late. So instead of telling her about my probs I just told her to leave before she started saying that I was making her late. Then this afternoon when she came home she came through the door and was mad becuz I did'nt tell her that I stayed home then she said  that it felt like nobody cared about her and ran into her room!!! WTF!??! Honestly I could'nt care less when she ran like a ***** into her room.  So I just waited for her to come out of the room and when she did she came out angry. She was telling me that every morning I was going to leave with her and wake up earlier and go to sleep earlier. I did'nt say anything. I did'nt know where this was comming from. I would think that if someones daughter told them that they were depressed that they would be more affectionate to them but she was'nt she just pushed me to the side and once again tried to make things about her. I poured my heart out to her and opened up more then I EVER have to any other human being in my life. Anytime I have a problem and I tell her she always says the same thing, it's like she really does'nt care about me. I remember one time( this is a true story) I was on her bed crying and she was talking to me for like 5-10 min. and then it was silent for a few moments and I was still crying, nose running and  all, when she says " Mila, what color do you think I should paint this room?" I did'nt know what to do, she was drinking beer so I don't know what was going on in her head. I told her that we were talking about my problems and that it was rude for her to do that. Then she just left me there. I just don't know what to do. She is making me feel like I can't trust anyone. I push potentially good friends away becuz I don't want to get hurt again. I don't know waht will happen to me in the future if I continue on like this, if she continues like this. Can anyone help me, advice??Suggestions??

My husband and I share a very healthy, happy & satisfying  married and sexual relationship.    I used to masturbate regularly before marriage. After marriage, I had stopped masturbating, and relied only on our sex as a means of my sexual satisfaction.       But of late, I have resumed masturbating (few times in a month). It is NOT because I am sexually dissatisfied or anything of that sort. It is just an old habit that has recurred.      I feel very guilty when i do it (almost as though i am cheating on my husband). He doesn't know that I masturbate. I thought it might probably hurt him, and I love him very much.      If a married woman masturbates, does it amount to cheating the husband? Is it wrong?

20090227075840AAwvYJU	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	Allergy?! Clinique?!?	Hi. On Sunday I purchased a range of products from the Clinique counter in Boots. As I had never used Clinique products before I had a skincare consultation and was told that my skin type was 3 - and on advise I bought - Naturally Gentle Eye Make-up Remover, Take The Day Off Cleansing Milk, Mild Liquid Facial Soap, Clarifying Lotion 2 and Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion with Pump. I followed the consultants advice and used the products correctly, twice a day. On Monday I developed a nasty red, itchy rash on my chest. I carried on using the products but avoided the neck area however yesterday, the rash still hadn't gone. I went back to my local Boots to seek advise and they couldn't explain what was wrong. They suggested that I change the Clarifying Lotion to the Mild one, and change the moisturising lotion to the Gel, as I may have a lanolin allergy. I used the new products last night and this morning and still have this itchy, burning rash on my chest. My face also feels quite dry, and I'm wondering if it because I changed from the lotion to the gel moisturiser? I am getting married this year and wanted to have fresh, clear skin, however I am very concerned about my allergy to Clinique products and I am worried about having bad skin. I would return to Boots to express my concerns again, but I'm not sure that they know what is wrong and don't want to be told to try other products in case they may the situation worse. Can you please suggest what you think I should do/try? Has anyone else had a similar experience?!

20090304152922AAfdKJi	Health;Women's Health	Really Important I haven't had a period since December 08'!?	Well, I'm 14 years old. And I always get my period at the end of the month, and if I do miss a period it's because I just started having one at 10 years and nine months old. I use tampons and pads, I only have asthma, no other health problems other then allergies that are connected to asthma. I am trying to get back in the habit of taking my asthma pump twice a day as ordered. And I have been eating healthy as well, I went to  http://www.webmd.com  for advice on this matter but all of they're answers were for women only, My mother made an appointment with the teen clinic (in since I am now a teenager I no longer go to the pediatrician for such things as this) but I'm starting to get worried about this, I'm going into my 3rd month period less and I feel great! But I know that God gave women this gift and I plan on keeping it no matter how bland it seems...can someone help me out? I don't want to die young you know!

I have been feeling low lately and I have been recommended to take a test because I have been told I show several signs of severe depression.      I am embarrassed by it and I dont particularly want my parents to know. I am 16 and this is my last real option without just leaving it I suppose.      I feel bad for not telling my parents, but I cope with things by myself and I don't want them in my face asking me if I'm ok all the time because I know that will make it worse.

20090304150237AAaN30e	Health;Optical	When I wear glasses looking at the computer screen I sometimes go cross-eyed ot my eyes go blurry?	I'm mildly short-sighted (about -1.25 i think). I don't wear my glasses all the time, just when in class, watching the tv and sometimes when it's dark (my eyesight is hell in the dark)      I'm 15 and can wear my glasses when reading things close up- i can see things just as well as without glasses.      But, my question is why do my eyes either go cross-eyed or generally blurry if i have been looking at the screen for continuously for about 2 to 3 minutes. it never happens if i'm not wearing glasses?      should I just not wear my glasses on the computer. this would be fine at home but in computing it would be awkard and i prefer to wear my glasses in class, especially because the teacher usually puts the lights off when we're on the computers.       also: why do my eyes hate the dark? why can i always see worse in the dark, even if i'm watching something like a tv?? no-one seems to agree with me!!!

I can't use lotions or moisturizers beucase they all make my skin more oily and break-out more. My skin will not absorb the moisturizer, it just sits on the surface until you wash it off :(. but the dryness is painful :'(. I'm really stuck!!! :'(.

20090304150712AAiw810	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	My sons has bicuspid aortic valve - Is heavy breathing related to it?	My son is 6 years old, healthy otherwise, very active (hyper) with lots of energy. However, he was born with bicuspid aortic valve and heart beat was fluctuating between 60 - 120 too much when he was born so pediatric cardiologist was called who ran lots of tests and said in his notes he did not find anything specific to fluctuating heart-rate but found kid had bicuspid aortic valve.      We kept following up with cardiologists every year and last time I went to see a cardiologist who ran thorough tests (EKG, and detailed Ultrasound since he had some students in the room so they spent quite some time). Verdict was I don’t need to see a cardiologist for my son anymore and should not be concerned about it as "it was minor now and he feels the kid is fine looking him over-all".      But recently I have started feeling my son takes heavy breathing after some running. He tires earlier than he used to, and is breathing heavily when elder brother and the younger sister are just fine playing with him.      Wondering what is causing to his breathing? Can bicuspid aortic valve cause this? Is this possible valve got bad one year after cardiologist said it was fine? There are many questions coming to mind.      Thanks!

Okay um, yesterday around 10:30 when i went to sleep, my brother "accidentally" poked my eye pretty hard. So with my rage i jumped onto my brother but, he kicked me pretty hard and i flew across and slammed my hand onto like a ledge.. on the bottom of the bed. sorta looks like this     http://www.countrybed.com/beds/bed_large...    well on the side parts, i hit my hand there but on my bed its sharp! So i quickly said turn on the lights! and my hand had about a cut a little bit smaller than a dime. The cut was diagonal so the skin is still attached but just like .. hanging there. I quickly washed my hand and wet it with water, i dried it and put a band aid over it. My retarded brother told me to keep that flap of the skin on, so i put the skin back on because it was still attached and i put a band aid over it. When i came back from school and checked on it, the wound is now black/red and the skin re attached!! Should i go see a doctor or should i wait a little and see how well it heals? Thanks for helping!

It's been like this for a little over a day and I don't think it had to do with activity or sleep.  I think it has to do with whatever I have.      On monday I was positive I had the flu.  I had all the symptoms.  Yesterday they died down, so I only had enlarged, sore tonsils, stiff muscles (including my neck) and decreased appetite.  Same symptoms today, essentially...      But my neck is worse.      My school's health center ruled out the flu an strep yesterday.  I don't know what I have.      My neck is stiffer today than it was yesterday by quite a bit.  I'm a little worried something may be wrong.
20090304152245AAaK0fK	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Am I going to have a heart attack or is there something wrong with my heart?	I'm 16 years old, Overweight, High Blood Pressure, and have Anxiety.      Yes I know Anxiety attacks and Heart Attacks are different.   But the thing is, something happened yesterday which made me worry that i can have a heart attack or there is something wrong with my heart. Yesterday when i came home from my Friend's house I was trying to take off my socks but they were wet from the snow which made them harder to take off. When i was trying to take off my sock i felt a muscle become tight somewhere in my ribs but i could'nt tell if it was rib or heart since i was bending over alittle to take off the sock. So i said ok ok its ok nothing bad happened. I put my hand over my chest ( this is how i feel my heart beat ) and my heart was beating real fast. I knew it was my anxiety because my heart is always beating fast 24/7. I cant really calm down from my anxiety thats why its always beating fast. Anyways the only thing i felt was heart beat fast, chest pain/tightness, and lump/heat in throat. I also sometimes would get pain in either of my arms anywhere. But i also had pain in my arms before this even happened. So i just layed in bed trying to calm down. The next morning i woke up and i was really tired and was shaking. I always shake from my anxiety. So i'm in the shower and im thinking "ok no heart attack awesome!" and then  when i yawned i could of swore i felt a tightness or something in my heart/left side of chest or it could have been my rib idk really. So i get out of the shower and get dressed. Once again, Rapid Heart Beat, Chest Pain/Tightness etc. I call my social worker from my house and shes not in so i just wait a while before i walk to school. My mom goes crazy because she found something i didnt want her to find so i get nervous and have an anxiety attack or at least rapid heart beat. I calm down and just walk to school. I ask my teachers how someone would know if they pulled a muscle in their heart and my teachers said i didnt pull a muscle and thats its nothing and it could have been my rib. So i just start crying because of all of the pain ive had from my anxiety. So my teachers talk to me while im crying and crying actually helped me because i didnt feel any kind of pain while crying. Only thing i felt was like a weakness or lightness in my arm all the way to the side of my chest. I was alright for a while but i would get chest pains once and a while during school. alot more often then i would. So i'm just here thinking "ok so no heart attack but what if i did pull a muscle in my heart or something" so is there anyway i can tell thats theirs def. nothing wrong with my heart and the tightness was coming from my rib. Any stretching exercises  u know that can help me out. Also i talked to my social worker later this day and she said it was just my rib because im over weight and i should consider losing weight and take care of my body. And i told her what if my chest felt tight and she said doesnt matter because it is just my anxiety. I also feel that theres more chest pains/aches/stuff because im more concentrated on my heart/chest. Can this all be Anxiety and could it have been my rib that felt tight. I would go to the hospital just to make myself calm but my parents always tell me no. that its my anxiety. i didnt tell them about my recent chest pains but before that if i had a pain anywhere in my body they would just say its anxiety. also my mom keeps saying she doesn't want to be embarrassed because we've been to the hospital a couple of times and everything turned out to be anxiety except this one time it was sciatica.

The online calorie calculators tell me that for my age, weight, height, and activity level that I should have about 2500 calories a day. Now, I have this obsession with calories where I "round up." For example, if something is 250 calories, I will round it up to 300, and count it as 300. I find that I am hungry throughout the day, and never satisfied with my meals ... So, what would have been 2000 calories, I count as 2500 ...   So here are my questions:   1. Should I be counting calories by their exact caloric value   2. Will I gain weight if I switch to counting exact calories from rounding?   3. Opinions? Thoughts?

So, can eating healtier foods make you feel better?       I dont think this is true because I try to eat healthy all the time. I frequently eat a bran muffin, and then dinner (which usually consists of meat and vegetables), and usually a healthy cereal for snack.      BUT I feel like crap and I am sick of living. PLEASE tell me what diet will make you feel better. OK.

I have a slight cough but no green or yellow mucus. I have tried the nose wash which didn't really do anything, Sudafed the regular red ones, Sudafed 24, nose sprays, sleeping with a vaporizer, vicks vapor rub and hot steamy showers. Nothing seems to help. I also have pressure and strange tingly feeling in my Eustachian tube in my ear. I live in CA where they monitor the purchase of decongestants so I cant keep trying new things. Just need one good remedy maybe even an aroma therapy oil or something.

My parents live in another room and don't get these bites. I've also tried washing my bed and pillow covers, but that didn't help. I've been considering bed bugs, but it can't be this huge of a bite.
