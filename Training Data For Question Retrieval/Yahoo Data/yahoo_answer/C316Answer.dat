9qU9ojuDaa	yes mr Murcia. after 40 the Rocket is in full blast. thats why i sleep in the Fridge every night. lmfao''?|`|gGQssXS1aa	when  we are young a day seems like a week and a week seems like a month and a month seems like a year, especially if we are waiting for something.<br>  But as we grow older the time seems to accelerate and a day seems like 5 hours, a week seems like couple of days and a year seems like about 5 months or so. Someone told me that its not time that is getting faster but its the person that is slowing down and that fact makes it seem like time is faster. I dread to think how fast time will seem to pass if I get to 80 years old!!|`|rMP9BCyGaa	It's March already, I'm not ready to be 50 yet I had my 52nd birthday in January lol, boy oh boy that seemed to creep up behind me a bit quick!<br>  <br>  My 18 yr old daughter has even started saying about time passing quickly so it must be bad if the  young are complaining about it too lol.|`|v2ut95Wzaa	Yeah i know it seems like i've been alive 5 minutes!|`|7LkJ8G1Jaa	extremely.|`|8NRoO1Skaa	Yes, and I've heard that the nose and ears never stop growing, by the time I reach my 80's I'm gonna look like Dumbo<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.usefulzero.com/d/197" rel="nofollow">http://images.usefulzero.com/d/197</a>|`|U6XzrG91aa	Nope|`|Ubb4RiXLaa	Uh-huh, time won't give us time, it just keeps marchin on|`|hVKqKjrjaa	Time goes by so slowly and time can mean so much....

Atm, years seem to be going by really fast for me... I'm 15 and i can still remember clearly when i was 5!|`|AA11989999	That is a time-compression illusion caused by memory--by the act of looking backwards. As life is proceeding in real present time, it is not too quick at all. Sometimes too slow. :-)|`|faddb3c58c57bc112ff5dec44a742ff8aa	Yes there`s not enough time to enjoy life in between work and the things that you have to do.

A second punch line was not needed.|`|6ILj5ienaa	Uh, that wasn't really a 'love' story. But, if it was a joke, I'd give it 7/10. But without the last line. Ruined it. Wait - you didn't make it up did you? It's really good if you made it up.|`|9ayA14Hraa	I was expecting that.....it be funnier if it weren't so predictable, good thing he farted, the byotch was rude to him too!|`|utOVoGo3aa	lol I would love it more if it had a good ending, well for me, but it was funny. 7-10 for effort, I love a good love story.|`|NOIseyASaa	I give 8|`|jxbNUjuWaa	lol :P<br>  I rate it 8-10 :)

Batman.|`|Kko9AWSjaa	Jason, because he's basically an undead, and batman would run out of gadgets at some point. I'd root for batman. LOL weird question but it wasted some time to answer so thanks.|`|u9RwzLPnaa	Since Batman trained Jason (assuming you're talking about the second Robin instead of the immortal Jason from Friday the 13th) I would say Batman, but Jason isn't afraid to use lethal methods were Batman doesn't. I would say that Jason has a slight advantage.<br>  <br>  So I would say Jason, because lethal force is the most efficient way where Batman will use non lethal force and try and save everybody where as Jason doesn't give a damn. <br>  <br>  Jason okay.

dlqa6yFkaa	*We had a friend in jail a few years ago and we used to visit him. He did 18mths for bashing up the guy who raped his sister.|`|tDUs971eaa	A friend of mine did 1 year in our state prison for hitting a guy in<br>  the head with a baseball bat. It was touch-and-go for a few days<br>  but thankfully the guy lived. <br>  There are two interesting facts about the case. The man who<br>  did the year in prison did not swing the bat. He told the police<br>  that he did it. He took the blame to protect his step father who<br>  had bipolar disorder and was actually the one who swung the bat.<br>  Would you do a year in prison to protect your mentally ill step father?<br>  The other interesting thing: the man who actually swung the bat<br>  was protecting his step daughter from her totally out of control<br>  ex husband. <br>  I am very much a law and order type guy, but one of the people<br>  I most respect did a year in prison.|`|DhmUgq0maa	Yes although he was only related to me by marriage...My step brother (dads wife's son), He's been in jail for the last 12 years or so...he is on a her Majesty's sentence which pretty much means he will never get out, He had only just turned 18 when he went to jail for murdering his best friend in a heated argument over a girl...He stabbed him 42 times with a kitchen knife.<br>  I don't have any contact with him as we moved from the UK to Australia soon after that and he wasn't really part of my family anyway.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	yes my older brother! gone for 10 yrs now.........<br>  <br>  i write him and I visit every year at least once.

I give astrological readings based on a person's complete birth chart, using their birth day, year, time & place. I look at their natural strengths & weaknesses and help them to understand how to work with these things. I also take a look at the next two, three years and give them an idea of what kind of things will be coming up, and possible things to be prepared for.<br>  <br>  Is that what you mean by "life horoscope?"|`|SlhdAZzpaa	Many...|`|IiRHvz1Paa	3 out of the 5<br>  though i don't really believe in horoscope stuff...
akcGfgdcaa	I don't think Heath Ledger's performance was overrated as it was fantastic. But the film overall, yes, I think it was overrated. Don't get me wrong, I loved the film but did it deserve to make over a billion? Oh hell to the no.<br>  <br>  There was nothing about the direction that stood out, the script wasn't anything special either.|`|vAU6QkMeaa	I think so, the movie wasn't that great, and it was too long. Heath Ledger was great in it, if he wan't in it, the movie would have flopped, and I'm not saying that just because he 'passed'.|`|376abf017f5ceda0dc7a5f6414b42db2aa	No, not at all. It's a great movie. I'm not really into Batman at all actually, and I really liked that movie. The acting in the movie was awesome.|`|wxylH2R6aa	No, I do not think it was overrated. I thought it was a great movie.|`|C8yzJmKCaa	yes, I think it VERYYY overrated@|`|WM5EG9Tyaa	No... I love Dark Knights....|`|uDXpoFlbaa	I liked the movie but i have to say that I thought it was overrated. I just couldn't get into it. I thought it was going to be like one of the best movies ever but i thought it was far from it. It wasn't bad, it was a good movie but no where near as good as what people were making it out to be!|`|UPqBFLNraa	Yes, VERY. I don't think people will like it if not because of the death of Heath Ledger...|`|kGkUG0fKaa	No. I thought it was a great film. I think it had so much buzz because of Heath Ledgers death but in all I loved it and not just for the Joker but the whole film. It took Batman to whole new level.<br>  <br>  edit* ouch I didn't know it made 1, 001, 758, 644 umm thats a bit too much, it wasn't that great. thats some revenue!|`|ynVelZ6zaa	Yes. It was a bit too long and I don't really think that much happened in it to make really really exciting.

uahXvRSmaa	The soundtrack to Disney's "The Sleeping Beauty" was taken from Tchaikovsky's ballet score of the same name. Also, Disney's Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 are all about classical music.<br>  <br>  Generally the films of Stanley Kubrick extensively used classical music. <br>  <br>  2001: A Space Odyssey contains some of the most famous use of classical music in the movies.<br>  <br>  Barry Lyndon, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining also use a lot of classical music (some of it arranged for synthesizer by Wendy Carlos)<br>  <br>  A few noted classical composers actually wrote film scores. The statute of the composers means that you can include these film scores as being serious classical music as opposed to, say, John Williams' themes to the Star Wars movies (though I love those more than the music by the "classical" composers) Film scores by famous classical composers include, <br>  <br>  Sergei Prokofiev- Ivan the Terrible, Alexander Nevsky<br>  Aaron Copland- The Red Pony<br>  Leonard Bernstein- On the Waterfront<br>  Philip Glass- Koyaanisquttsi, Powaqqatsi, Naqoyqatsi, Kundun, The Hours, among others<br>  Tan Dun- "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"|`|ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	Apocalypse Now - Ride of the Valkyries<br>  Elvira Madigan - Mozart Piano Concerto No 21 (so much so that for a time the concerto was named 'The Elvira Madigan')<br>  Scott of the Antartica - Whole score by Vaughan Williams, later used for his Sinfonia Antartica<br>  Korngold - Sea Hawk, Elizabeth and Essex (later used in his violin concerto)<br>  Walton Henry V and Spitfire Prelude and Fugue<br>  <br>  Many leading composers, apart from the above have written film music. In England, Alwyn and Malcom Arnold were very prolific, in America the likes of  William Steiner and Andre Deutsche were classically trained composers.

You could also use the System Management Interface Tool (SMIT) smit chvg fast path to run this command.<br>  <br>  Note:<br>  On AIX 5.2 and later only Enhanced Concurrent Capable volume groups will be created when the -c or -C flags are specified.<br>  Flags<br>  <br>  Notes:<br>  Only the -a, -R, -S, -u, and -h options are allowed on the volume group that has a snapshot volume group. <br>  Only the -a, -R, -S, and -u options are allowed on the snapshot volume group. <br>  -a AutoOn Determines if the volume group is automatically activated during system startup. The AutoOn variable can be either of the following: <br>  n <br>  The volume group is not automatically activated during system startup. <br>  y <br>  The volume group is automatically activated during system startup.  <br>  -b Sets the bad-block relocation policy of a volume group. The default value is yes. <br>  y <br>  Will turn on the bad-block relocation policy of a volume group. <br>  n <br>  Turns off the bad block relocation policy of a volume group.  <br>  -B Changes the volume group to Big VG format. This can accommodate up to 128 physical volumes and 512 logical volumes. <br>  Notes:<br>  The -B flag cannot be used if there are any stale physical partitions. <br>  Once the volume group is converted, it cannot be imported into AIX 4.3.1 or lower versions. <br>  The -B flag cannot be used if the volume group is varied on in concurrent mode. <br>  There must be enough free partitions available on each physical volume for the VGDA expansion for this operation to be successful. <br>  Because the VGDA resides on the edge of the disk and it requires contiguous space for expansion, the free partitions are required on the edge of the disk. If those partitions are allocated for user usage, they will be migrated to other free partitions on the same disk. The rest of the physical partitions will be renumbered to reflect the loss of the partitions for VGDA usage. This will change the mappings of the logical to physical partitions in all the PVs of this VG. If you have saved the mappings of the LVs for a potential recovery operation, you should generate the maps again after the completion of the conversion operation. Also, if the backup of the VG is taken with the map option and you plan to restore using those maps, the restore operation may fail since the partition number may no longer exist (due to reduction). It is recommended that backup is taken before the conversion, and right after the conversion if the map option is utilized. <br>  Because the VGDA space has been increased substantially, every VGDA update operation (creating a logical volume, changing a logical volume, adding a physical volume, and so on) may take considerably longer to run. <br>   <br>  -c Same as -C flag. In AIX 5.2 and later only Enhanced Concurrent Capable volume groups will be created. <br>  -C Changes the volume group into an Enhanced Concurrent Capable volume group. Changes the volume group varied on in non-concurrent mode to Enhanced Concurrent Capable. This requires that the volume group be re-imported on all other nodes prior to activation in Enhanced Concurrent mode. Changes the volume group varied on in Concurrent mode to an Enhanced Concurrent mode volume group. Only use the -C flag with the HACMP? ES. It has no effect on volume groups and systems not using the HACMP ES product. <br>  Enhanced Concurrent volume groups use Group Services. Group Services ships with HACMP ES and must be configured prior to activating a volume group in this mode.<br>  <br>  Use this flag to change a volume group into an Enhanced Concurrent Capable volume group.<br>  <br>  Notes:<br>  Enhanced Concurrent volume groups use Group Services. Group Services ships with HACMP ES and must be configured prior to activating a volume group in this mode. <br>  Only Enhanced Concurrent Capable volume groups are supported when running with a 64-bit kernel. Concurrent Capable volume groups are not supported when running with a 64-bit kernel. <br>   <br>  -g Will examine all the disks in the volume group to see if they have grown in size. If any disks have grown in size attempt to add additional PPs to PV. If necessary will determine proper 1016 multiplier and conversion to big vg. <br>  Notes:<br>  The user might be required to execute varyoffvg and then varyonvg on the volume group for LVM to see the size change on the disks. <br>  There is no support for re-sizing while the volume group is activated in classic or enhanced concurrent mode. <br>  There is no suppo|`|3TBdrf6caa	nothing....its 6 a.m. <br>  but ill have............don't know yet :p|`|akcGfgdcaa	2 slices of toast, a bakewell tart, a butter brioche with nutella, a banana.....and a milky coffee.<br>  <br>  Kind of a weird breakfast, as I just took whatever I saw first!|`|vLIt0ESPaa	Well, I haven't had breakfast yet since, here it's 3 in the morning. but when i have breakfast, I will probably have a poppyseed muffin and some coffee :)|`|IML2SXoWaa	in afternoon, I had cheese, I called it breakfast.|`|zJ2GKkwAaa	cornflakes<br>  <br>  bleh<br>  <br>  x.x|`|FRwl0GI0aa	Chapatti and Potato|`|ixmaM395aa	A banana!|`|ujsSyiJfaa	Cereal.

Training and exercise can do quite a bit there too.<br>  If you're serious, contact some teachers who know the sax and/or visit some instrument stores selling them and ask for advice. Those people specialise in helping people find an instrument that suits them.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	lung capacity would be the only real concern I could think of.|`|t2evcVVEaa	no dearm youre not too small. but if youre a smaller person you will have to develop the lungs for it. and it will come in time. you should go for it.

I prefer to hold the paper in my hands.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	The library has inter-library loan, and not every library have grumpy old Anti-Alan Moore people who persuade them to get rid of every one of his Graphic Novels we see (though I know I am not alone).<br>  <br>  I do not advocate reading those books.  Obviously, but that is no reason not to suggest the obvious:  Most books are available through inter-library loan.  Even if you don't have money (I often don't) I advocate saving up and going to your comics store for books like Hellboy or that reprint of Jack Kirby's Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen which DC just did.  The fourth World was an awesome comic series.<br>  <br>  As far as discouragement about reading Graphic Novels goes, Dave Gibbons, who did the Watchmen, is one of the artists out of Britain with one of the more interesting careers.  He was in fact pilloried in Newsweek once for one of his career choices (back before the watchmen this was).<br>  <br>  And I do advocate reading Neal Gaimen.  Not just because he's written good novels (some of them are awesome, including the Graveyard Book) but precisely because the Sandman collections are like a who's who of International Fantasy illustration -- whether comics (P. Craig Russell) or not (Malcolm Dean).|`|o3JO2Tq8aa	I would check a local library or see if inter-library loan if you can pick it up there.  I don't have money to spend on too many graphic novels myself, and I've checked out both at a local library.

AbRfd29Haa	It does look like a clock, and that's intentional... that's a motif you'll see with regularity in the book. It represents the nuclear doomsday clock, which is a little in-yer-face in the film, but not so much in the book. <br>  <br>  You can find out more about this, and practically anything else, at the Watchmen wiki:<br>  <a href="http://watchmen.wikia.com/wiki/Doomsday_Clock" rel="nofollow">http://watchmen.wikia.com/wiki/Doomsday_...</a><br>  <br>  Notice the symbology extends deeper, too.. the name "Watchmen" can be interpreted two ways, since "watch" is both the act of overseeing something, and a kind of timepiece. This also goes back to the group from the 1950s that preceeded the Watchmen, the Minutemen.

ME4XWNmRaa	In their final version it was in 1962 when Ringo joined.|`|8d8ejHPfaa	The Beatles began with John Lennon performing in a skiffle band known as The Quarrymen in  1956.  McCartney joined in 57. As the band developed and changed, and George later joined, they changed their name to The Silver Beatles, and later to just The Beatles.  The Beatles original drummer was Pete Best, who was replaced by Ringo, who was with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes at the time (about 1962 or 63).<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quarrymen" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quarrym...</a><br>  <br>  An excellent book for Beatlefans to learn about the origins of the Beatles is "The love you make: An insider's story of the Beatles",   By Peter Brown and Stephen Gaines.  <br>  However it is erm....kind of R rated for high school students. Likely to be TMI for a school paper.<br>  <br>  If you can rent the Beatles Anthology, that would be a good one to watch.|`|jAmAQj97aa	06/04/1960 - The Silver Beatles change their name to "The Beatles" sometime before a show at The Grosvenor Ballroom, Grosvenor Road, Liscard, Wallasey, Cheshire, England.<br>  <br>  08/18/1962 - When The Beatles perform at Hulme Hall, Bolton Road, Port Sunlight, England, Ringo appears for the first time as a member of The Beatles, having had a two-hour rehearsal in preparation. This is the first appearance of The Beatles as the world would come to know them - - John, Paul, George, and Ringo.|`|87CAVhs2aa	They started around 1958.<br>  <a href="http://beatles.ncf.ca/timeline.html" rel="nofollow">http://beatles.ncf.ca/timeline.html</a><br>  That's a GREAT time line that basically covers everything.<br>  You should also include some solo information after the break-up.|`|WIguyGcZaa	Well, they met eachother in 1958 when they were The Silver Beetles and they formed as The Beatles in 1960:)|`|onbwN4csaa	There first time in the USA was on the<br>  Ed Sullivan show.  in the 60s
9O4Aqab5aa	No. It's rated R. It tells you why It's rated R. It said there would be all those things in the movie. Why people brought there kids i don't know, because they are bad parents, although I've known some kids that can take that kind of stuff.|`|m0xehTLqaa	who cares lol. it was absolutley amazing!|`|KK9ui9u2aa	Wut did u expect its rated R.

If a film is slapped with an R-rating, DONT BRING YOUR KID!|`|kGkUG0fKaa	Um. I actually don't think it was that gruesome. I mean I have seen way worse blood and gore in movies. Watchmen actually didn't have enough blood and gore, a few killing scenes, some guts..okay..good but u have to admit there has been worse, hell Hostel had more blood and gore. I was gonna bring my son but I had read too many reviews saying it wasn't suitable for children( plus it was rated -r but he has seen rated r movies before) so I went to see it without him and decided the reviews were right. good movie though. The nudity wasn't that bad, yea Dr. M was naked with a blue penis but thats nothing, for a kid, I'd say bad but for teens, its a freaking penis. They learn about sex in school and having babies at 15, a blue penis isn't gonna hurt em! The sex scenes um...did you see Friday the 13th! had more boobs and @ss than actual killing!! Most of these movies today have so much sex or if not actual sex, the hint of it. girls in short skirts and bikinis and such. it bothers me that parents will let their children watch those teen movies full of drunken sex craved teens but when a movie comes out that shows the maturity of directorial creation, it's shocking! I guess its okay to watch men kill people with guns in movies, run from the cops, rape, rob, break out of jail and such in these movies but not a few sex scenes which were not that bad. only one scene was like wow, with dan and sil spectre the others barely showed skin or nip or anything.<br>  <br>  I'm just saying I thought it was a good movie. directed well, not the greatest acting but very well done. everything was tastefully done, minimal<br>  <br>  <br>  I didn't take my son cause he is 6..............parents read the book (and knew it RATED R)and still took their kids then got mad...what did they expect no sex, its hollywood for crying out loud. Hell even shrek had hinting of sex and cursing!

PeqdWE3waa	The Instrument I learnt for 2yrs was Piano. I really loved it and got honours in every exam taken.  Then unfortunately my teacher had a stroke and she had to let me go..big mistake as I have never furthered my piano experience.<br>  My now Ex Husband knew how much I missed my piano but we were renting and no room for a piano; so he bought me a basic guitar.<br>  No One was willing to teach me because once you learn piano it takes you so much longer to learn Guitar.<br>  Then we bought an expensive Lowry Organ and I had some lessons with it but nothing to really help me when the teacher asked me to take on teaching his beginner students; well I thought you must be kidding I am not qualified to teach anyone.  So I said no.<br>  I have privately helped friends kids but found I was spending far to much time with them because all they wanted was to play something modern straight away.<br>  I still cannot get anyone to teach me Piano and the Guitar is still sitting there not be played.  Mind you I am a singer and if I could play guitar it would have been so great to be able to carry out myaccompanimentnment.  But when you think of it I still can as Keyboards today are so versatile with all the rhythms, chords, backing and sounds produced.|`|vexY7Bgvaa	This really depends on personal preference. <br>  <br>  I play guitar primarily, however I took up piano a little later.<br>  If you want to be able to entertain friends at parties or busk or anything else like that, a smaller portable instrument, such as the guitar, would be for you. <br>  <br>  The piano is probably the easiest to understand, the notes, and to a certain extent, the scales are easy to work out. And once you have a little musical knowledge you can play chords and melody lines that sound really good. But it is very difficult to play to  a very high standard, bearing in mind you will be using both hands both feet and all your fingers most of the time.<br>  <br>  However you might want to go for something a little different, maybe an 'eastern' instrument, or a ukulele. You can buy an alright budget uke for about ￡20, and they have only 4 strings and can sound really cool. <br>  <br>  I would advise checking out a few "how to" vids on you tube and possibly trying out a few instruments. <br>  Go for it, you will learn loads and be a better person or, if you play guitar really, a worse person but one who has loads of sex.

Y1aAGPURaa	LOL!!!!   Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  A mother passing by her son's bedroom was astonished to see that his bed was nicely made and everything was picked up. Then she saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow that was addressed to 'Mom' . With the worst premonition, she opened the envelope with trembling hands and read the letter.<br>  <br>  Dear Mom,<br>  It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with you and Dad.<br>  I have been finding real passion with Stacy and she is so nice. But I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing, tattoos, tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am. But it's not only the passion...... Mom she's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.<br>  Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people that live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy.  In the meantime, we will pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so Stacy can get better. She deserves it. Don't worry Mom.  I'm 15 and I know how to take care of myself.  Someday I'm sure that we will be back to visit so that you can get to know your grandchildren.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Your son, Jonathan <br>  <br>  P. S. Mom, none of the above is true.  I'm over at Tommy's house.  I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the report card that's in my center desk drawer. <br>  I love you.<br>  <br>  Call me when it's safe to come home|`|TjWA37kuaa	LOL hahaha that a good one :) * star 4 U|`|jz2tlMiiaa	Hahahaha, still one of the better golden oldies, great stuff.!|`|w2evN22Yaa	Awww lmfao.

5t9stUYjaa	In a way I think it does. As Eminem said, 'Music is a reflection of self' - and I think this goes both ways, in what we listen to and what certain musicians write.<br>  I mean, I can't imagine Eminem chasing butterflies and painting his room bright pink, if you get what I mean. And likewise, a Satanic worshiper is not likely to spend their time listening to something like The Corrs.<br>  But it does all depend on mood and emotion. Not everyone who listens to rap necessarily wants to be a rapper or wants to sport a do-rag and go bustin' up. It may be that at that time in their life, or that time of day/year, whatever the case may be, rap is what they want to listen to.<br>  Ozzie Osborne may have ripped off some heads in his time, but that would be him - again, no butterflies or pink walls for him.<br>  In a way it probably comes down to the individual, but I think it might be the other way around: that who you are, your experiences and moods, dictates the kind of music that you are predisposed to.|`|6t2EdSjOaa	It doesn't make you who you are , it in a way shows who you are though. It's like an extention of oneself the same way it is an extension of the artist who wrote/plays/composes the music, it's another form of expression.|`|6In638rbaa	I totally disagree with that because I listen to different types of music/songs depending on what mood I'm in.<br>  <br>  And if I listen to screamo & rap does that make me an emo gangsta? (I like that one) lol.|`|mFInMKSaaa	yes, i think so.  yes, don't listen to pretend.  you prefer one more than the other even though you may listen to the other once in a while. but everyone does take something from it other than that of someone else. i listen to classic metal because it is faster and more exciting.  and I think that suits my personality

32P3hG0Laa	I'm not quite sure why you are only commenting on Cap ladies... All Capricorns like to control... everything. Pure Capricorn energy (and no one is purely any one sign) is about extreme practicality. The question to a Capricorn is always "Is this worth something? Can I use it? What is it good for? How does it work?"<br>  <br>  Sometimes, in an effort to make everything practical and useful, they assume controlling everything is the way to go. Ideally, as they get older, they relax and realize they don't have to control everything... everything doesn't have to have a point or a purpose, everything doesn't have to be useful...<br>  <br>  In particular, women in society do not have as much power and respect as men, and have more limited choices due to the sexist nature of our society, so Capricorn women may be a little more likely to try and control things through a man... It's not a great idea to start with, but hopefully they learn to grow and evolve beyond that...|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	caps love 2 control money, household, relationships, any type of future planning like purchasing of a major thing like house, car,etc. they also want the last word on how 2 spend holidays, be the main planner of trips, etc. their job is the major priority in their life, so be prepared 2 ake a back seat 2 their careers and if your married w/kids , be prepared 2 be the one at home w/them as the cap will be on "must go" busniess trips. the balance of power is usually on their side.|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	Couldn't have said it better than "bOozebuz"|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	I wasn't aware that female Capricorns were known for their desire to control. In the hundreds maybe thousands of astrology books I've read, I don't think I've ever seen that specific interpretation given by a reputable astrologer.<br>  <br>  That said, Aspicco is quite correct..People who are useful and clever to the greater good are of worth to us Capricorn females. People who are trifling and wasteful get little of our attention. <br>  <br>  As for control, we only wish to control ourselves, occasionally the people who work for us if we have a specific mission to accomplish..there's no need to "control" our mates...we chose mates that work toward the same goals, have the same values, so "control" really isn't an issue. That sounds like you heard that from some bitter person who had a bad experience.<br>  <br>  **Actually,  in my household, I don't run the budget (my husband is better at it), I don't "wear the pants (that's my mate's job), I don't control the relationship (we work together to get stuff done)...so I guess that's kind of a stereotype.|`|ax9xk0Ndaa	Aspicco and din hit the nail on the spot..<br>  <br>  I'm not controlling at all..in the domineering sense..<br>  <br>  But i do look at things like what can it do for me how does it work lol<br>  If it's wasteful then it gets little attention..<br>  <br>  Yes it's so true the most i control is myself..<br>  <br>  And i wouldn't like anyone to try and take control of me.. I think when i have a family i'd like to be protective and keep everything undercontrol..but i guess that's any parent's wish..

pAih5juAaa	I think it really varies.<br>  <br>  There are some really into "tweenies" / teens and their opposites the Twilight haters.  I can't really tell you much more than observation.  The really heavily into fans (at least the ones on line here for example) are teens, and can be a little annoying with their constant "we love Edward / Jacob / insert character here".  You'll see the love hate relationship type thing here.  I think it's just that fan phase of teenagedom - some love rock stars, others movie stars and ... .   There are other hardcore fans who write / draw and have their forums elsewhere and tend to be less seen and somewhat less annoying to the haters.  The haters, generally, seem to be just not that into it and dislike the constant fans and media stories invading everything.<br>  <br>  I can tell you about myself and the adult "fans" that I know.<br>  <br>  I picked up the books after a year of working my normal ful time job and normal life (gym 3 to 5 times a week, a movie - most weeks, social life, life / chores etc plus studying 2 nights a week - 15 hour days after work - woohoo! plus another 6 - 12 - 18 hours plus per week studying at home.  I didn't have time to read much aside from text books and was wanting a book,  Ended up reading the entire series in two and a half weeks.  The readersI know, about a dozen, range in age from 21 to their 60's and have enjoyed the series.  Some are vampire lovers from way back, others not, and some are supernatural lovers (ghost stories and stuff) and a few not...<br>  <br>  I think it's a reasonably easy read (all I know who read it were reading it around holidays / Christmas) and people want a bit of escapism.|`|h6wYudq0aa	Well, I don't see what all the fuss is about but my sister read the books and she thinks it is the best thing ever. I think that, maybe, it is the feeling that maybe (with a slim chance) a guy like Edward Cullen could come along and fall in love with someone like yourself. Then its the feeling of having a perfect, hot, protective boyfriend that will never let you go. Thats my theory and going off what my sister said this roughly sums it up. Also having a vampire as a boyfriend would be pretty cool.|`|AA11076088	well, i am not really a avid fan of twilight and never been even when it came out, but it can be maybe because of edward and how he is a vampire and how a ordinary girl had fallen in a trap of being seduced and loved by a vampire without knowing it. Thats where the drama begins. There are many characters which would relate to teens and thier personalities and actions would be very interesting and "awesome" for young readers and they would love reading it because of the characters.|`|YzZyjSZ9aa	hmmm...what can we say?...lol<br>  i think the story line is quite interesting...|`|RlHW1G4Uaa	i'm a fan of the books and movie, in fact I'm quite addicted to them. Despite this, i think the books are terrible pieces of literature with very poor writing. and the movie wasn't very good either.<br>  <br>   I think people love them so much because its just a perfect romance that everyone wishes they could have. There's a sense of realism within the books that makes some people think that a vampire could also fall madly in love with them. They also have a good mix of romance, action, humour within them.<br>  <br>  And while there are a lot of cliques, Meyer does have a lot of original ideas in the books as well, I think the books get better as they go, breaking dawn is the best. I think the first book is really quite boring... So stick with it!|`|726edd84935de8b35a78643bac84badaaa	Twilight gives rise to the idea of unconditional and totally complete love, which is very hard to find in our times. It basically brings to life something that was unimaginable, because it would be too good to be true. But Stephenie Meyer took the risk of too many 'cliches' and made them work. <br>  <br>  Edward is supposed to be the answer to all your problems.

And also, I know a lot of fans will hate me for this, but I think it is very overrated. I thought it was very ordinary. The book was ok in my opinion. Nothing new there.<br>  <br>  However, I think that the reason for all the commotion is that it is well publicized and when one person gets crazy about some stuff, others follow.|`|XzgIedtgaa	1) fantastic/engaging story<br>  <br>  2) fascinating characters, with deep backstories and round personalities<br>  <br>  Anything else?<br>  <br>  ---|`|pXdgTu5xaa	Twilight Is soooo Da Bestt!!!<br>  Robert Pattinson is Soo Fitt|`|kBBFbTPiaa	Its just because people think that edward is hot wich he is soo not|`|DOwgixu7aa	Well, it depends on you wether u like it or not...maybe u r not TWILIGHT type....and maybe we r...i just love it!!|`|4HoD3sX5aa	Just watch it and you will know :)<br>  <br>  Here is the site where you can watch Twilight online <a href="http://www.moviesss.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.moviesss.com</a>|`|B8Yzaq5waa	THANK YOU!!!<br>  <br>  OK now i understand that some people are in love with this move, but lets be real! it wasnt THAT good. it takes them 30 minutes before you even see a vamp, and 20 more to get to talk to him,...<br>  <br>  i know all you fans will thumbs down at me for my opinion, but thats fine. i didnt say dont like it,... but its like a crappy sci fi romance novel.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Teenage girls likes that teenage love, when they should be concentrating on their grades in high school. They have their whole life getting stuck into that. & no, I'm not some 40 year old advising this, I'm actually 18. I personally can't stand the hype. I don't judge in movies. So i read a long sypnosis about it to see what was so attracting. It was really stupid. Vampires? geez. But they like it. So let it be.

WdVlu97Aaa	check youtube...|`|lgg7DLy9aa	If it's in your bell, it's probably going to be tricky to get it out, I'd bring it to a music store. To avoid it, much sure you pass a cleaning cloth through the horn every time you use it (or at least before every time you leave it sitting for 1 day+).<br>  <br>  If it's in the neck, do the same thing, bring it to the music store then use a neck swab as often as possible.<br>  <br>  If it's your mouthpiece, try soaking it in warm water with vinegar for a few hours and/or clean it with a tooth brush and toothpaste. This should get rid of most build up. To avoid this TAKE YOUR REED OFF AFTER YOU PLAY! so much bacteria grows everywhere when you leave it on the mouthpiece so just take the 5 seconds to put it in a case. After that you should use a mouthpiece swab or anything else absorbent to make sure the inside of you MP is dry.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped and good luck maintaining your saxophone<br>  <br>  Hope this|`|Oqy3JFIHaa	Eek! Mold?! That's not good!  Well, here what I recommend. You should bring it to your local music store and ask them to do it for you. You make to make 100% sure it is all cleaned up! Try washing the mold off with a rag in the mean time. <br>  And make sure that after you use your sax, you clean the mouth piece as well as the body of the sax. It is also important to wipe the reed of any spit left on.
64491cf5ed73ad038115b2f4040d2213aa	You can guarantee the freedom of at least 10 prisoners tomorrow.<br>  <br>  The 20th person (the one who can see all the hats) has no idea whether his hat is black or red.   So instead, he names the color of the hat of the prisoner in front of him, guaranteeing the 19th man's freedom.  (He has a 50/50 shot of also saving himself, if he happens to be wearing the same color as the guy in front of him, but not guaranteed)  <br>  <br>  The 18th person is in the same position as the 20th with a 50/50 shot at guessing his own hat color, so instead he names the hat color of the 17th person.  <br>  <br>  This pattern continues until the 1st person so that every odd person is guaranteed their freedom.   (If the hat color distribution is totally random, you'd expect some of the even numbered people to happen to save themselves too!)<br>  <br>  Now if I were one of the prisoners, I'd sure try to be one of the odd numbered people in the queue!!|`|PvV0aNvfaa	its a hat trick|`|gMSaPvqkaa	the last one tells the colour of the hat of the prisoner infront of  him , so the one infront of him will know his hat colour and will be free, and the last prisoner might be the same colour as well and so on .|`|4w71vtKcaa	toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo looooooooooooooooooooonggggggggg but sounds funny..and i probably cant solve it...|`|xk845oILaa	half or more of them will be saved

308e1720900bf1444362b6ebf9afda07aa	Couple of things that suggest that Hinata is alive and that Naruto will not die. <br>  <br>  1. The show is called Naruto, so 100% he will not die.<br>  2. They just killed of jira (possibly kakashi) why would they risk killing all the side character?, so i dont think, this is their way of stretching the pain battle. It reminds of dragonball z, when one battle took about 15 episodes to finish lol.|`|WchsnNjhaa	I have difficulty answering this question because i don't really know what you mean. Lol.<br>  <br>  But anyways, I think they will make it as in survive because after all Naruto is the main character and Hinata, i just have a feeling she will definitely. :] so probability of around 97%<br>  <br>  I'm sorry if i didn't answered your question correctly but i hope it helped a bit. :)|`|crHWAoaWaa	Naruto is still around? <br>  <br>  You poor soul!|`|ndXvMLZ2aa	Well, I love NaruHina but the manga is nearing towards NaruSaku (unforunately) but I hope that maybe, just maybe Masashi Kishimoto will end it with NaruHina!|`|CzLvqFFsaa	if you mean them marrying then...<br>  <br>  i think hinata is dead so i think there is a 0% chance. but if she is still alive, then maybe there is a 54% chance. 42% chance he will go with sakura. 3% chance he stays single. 1% chance he dies.<br>  <br>  if you mean them surviving then...<br>  100% for naruto (for now, in the last season of the whole series he has 50% chance of surviving)<br>  75% for hinata (show might be more popular if she dies)
ligmlWpgaa	its gonna be tough,but i think yamato will deal with that.hes the only one with the power to suppress kyuubi.what i dont understand is how naruto can unleash 6 tails.what happened to 5-tail stage?and he needs to learn how to control kyuubi,like how kiraabi controlled hachibi.|`|POPeRDzXaa	perhaps nagato himself with his technique.|`|ZfsgIDa0aa	I'm thinking he uses his nature/sage chakra training to control the kyuubi.|`|CzLvqFFsaa	im sure the kyubii comes out in the final season and naruto fights it.

I miss Grissom and Sara and Warrick. last night there was a repeat from last year with the original cast and it made me sad to see because it was one of the last episodes with all of them  in it.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	STARTING?<br>  <br>  I have been a fan for the past 9 seasons. never and I mean never missed an episode! love it!<br>  <br>  I used to Watch CSI:Miami but Haraotio Caine is annoying with the gllasses and the way he talk.

qsuYKa3naa	Fiction for the most part. <br>  The part about Johnny took the style and made it famous will work|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Both fiction|`|AA12338134	Charley Pride was born in Mississippi in1938. Hank Williams was born in Alabama in 1923 and did not venture outside the state of Alabama until the 1940s. As for Johnny Cash "ripping off" the Carter Family's music, a lot of the early rockabilly artists, including Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, and others, were influenced by both country and blues. Cash himself (who grew up during the Depression and World War II) has said that he grew listening to the same music as everyone else.|`|iktf8WQhaa	Johnny Cash - June Carter - Spouses  I don't think anybody ripped off anyone's music.  <br>  Charlie Pride is not Hank Williams' son.|`|58UB5lqRaa	You certainly have a vivid imagination, to dream all this up even if you were related to the Carters.|`|AA10705929	The first part is racist B/S.  <br>  <br>  As far as Johnny stealing music, I doubt it, as even at that time, music was very well guarded and protected.<br>  As far as his playing and singing style, that can be debated, and a point for the argument is that he would have been awash in Carter music after he married June.<br>  As far as Mother Maybelle being influenced with black gospel...EVERYBODY was influenced by it!<br>  Johnny was greatly inspired and influenced by gospel music, whether black hymns or not.<br>  When you say that he had not developed his sound before he met June, that is not true...He just did not have a great body of work prior, but he WAS on Sun Records, alongside the likes of Elvis, Carl Perkins, Charlie Rich, and others.<br>  <br>  You will do better to read his and her's auto/biographies to learn more about the man and his music.|`|5R1MTLnQaa	Don't know about the Cash/Carter episode even though its quiet possible...as for Charlie Pride, that definitely is not true. Charlie, one of the most well known singers in country music, grew up with parents that were sharecroppers. He learned guitar at an early age but his dream was to become a professional baseball player and did, in fact, play minor league in the ***** Baseball League....Charlie is the most recognized black country singer and had well over thirty hits and is still touring today.|`|fV3fsBp3aa	I never heard anything about Charlie Pride being Hank's son, but he does have an illegitimate daughter, Jette WIlliams.

6fxr3VBGaa	second opinion edit: it is to me referring to the fact that there were more gods. the god who created man on Earth was saying Let Us(gods plural) create man(human beings) in our image, in our likeness(the image of gods in human flesh). God wanted to create humans as gods on Earth and heavenly bodies and all divinity on Earth with man. But then he realized the man he created to live on Earth was lead into temptation and sin and didn't obey him, at that point he realized what he thought at first wasn't going to work so he had to bring the pain and change **** up. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  black people(the original man)|`|os6FaEBlaa	The first answer has what everyone say, but I that also creates a paradox, that god can be all three in one but is not one is not all three, god that sh*t is f*cked up.|`|bwpU9G2Taa	God's referring to himself, the Holy Spirit/Ghost, and Jesus.<br>  <br>  This refers to the Trinity.<br>  <br>  All three make up the Godhead.

A4YkWnPzaa	iPod is a brand of portable media players designed and marketed by Apple Inc. and launched on October 23, 2001 (2001-10-23). The product line-up includes the hard drive-based iPod Classic, the touchscreen iPod Touch, the video-capable iPod Nano, and the compact iPod Shuffle. The iPhone can function as an iPod but is generally treated as a separate product. Former iPod models include the iPod Mini and the spin-off iPod Photo (since reintegrated into the main iPod Classic line). iPod Classic models store media on an internal hard drive, while all other models use flash memory to enable their smaller size (the discontinued Mini used a Microdrive miniature hard drive). As with many other digital music players, iPods, excluding the iPod Touch, can also serve as external data storage devices. Storage capacity varies by model.<br>  <br>  Apple's iTunes software can be used to transfer music to the devices from computers using certain versions of Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows operating systems.[2] For users who choose not to use Apple's software or whose computers cannot run iTunes software, several open source alternatives to iTunes are also available.[3] iTunes and its alternatives may also transfer photos, videos, games, contact information, e-mail settings, Web bookmarks, and calendars to iPod models supporting those features. Apple focused its development on the iPod line's unique user interface and its ease of use, rather than on technical capability. As of September 2008[update], more than 173 million iPods had been sold worldwide, making it the best-selling digital audio player series in history.[4]|`|qKUMaJcXaa	iPods are mp3 players what is wrong with you!|`|HXpR2bw0aa	Right now I'd buy none of them because I already have an iPod!<br>  <br>  But if I didn't have it then I'd buy an iPod, simply because they look better than most MP3 Players and I think they're easier to use because I can't get the hang of working an MP3 Player. However, if my iPod broke, then I'd probably buy a cheap MP3 Player if I was short on cash until I had enough money to buy an iPod, because I can't live without any means of portable music!   <br>  <br>  :)|`|iMo6cRN1aa	Well I have one of the new iPod Nano's theyre the best, although MP3's are cheaper, iPod's are better, so you get what u pay for.

Until I got into the Red Hot Chili Peppers...<br>  <br>  Three years on since then, my favourite bands now are Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, Rage Against The Machine, Foo Fighters, Audioslave, Temple Of The Dog, Mother Love Bone, Mad Season etc.<br>  <br>  My pop side still exists, as I also like Lady GaGa and Duffy :P (although Duffy is more soul than pop)<br>  <br>  Compare that to three years ago, when I was busy listening to (c)rap like Akon, Usher and NeYo. (However, I wasn't really a music person back then- I only had a few of the singles).<br>  <br>  So yes, I have made a total change- not just from being a pop fan to a rock/grunge fan, but also from being not much of a music listener to a complete music LOVER.|`|y1xPK3Txaa	Rap---->Nu-Metal---->trve metal.<br>  <br>  <br>  \m/.|`|cTYhnumDaa	GO PANTERA!<br>  <br>  I'm listening to Domination right now :p<br>  <br>  I've never liked rap but i used to always be sort of indie then after so many years of my dad playing heavy metal I started listening to slipknot the gradually more and more bands and now I don't look back. Funny thing is, I don't even like slipknot now but they introduced me to metal.<br>  <br>  I have to say I'm addicted to Pantera, Slayer, Black Sabbath, Arch Enemy, Disturbed, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Dream Theater, Megadeth, Judas priest and stuff like that|`|cYgxTWDVaa	I was fine w/ any music before.

(but yeah some new artists from this era are still really really good...it's just that most of the time, they are "hidden gems")<br>  <br>  Oh, and so i'm into metal and classic rock now ;p|`|OLO33GA4aa	I've always listened to metal & rock and will always listen to that only.|`|gJ8F634Haa	Both of my teen daughter's would only listen to rap.

jbAr62ybaa	Well, as most patrons of this forum are aware, I'm an avid Wagnerian; and would simply as a general rule, recommend the Dutchman.<br>  <br>       But you seem to have a unique situation, and one requiring more than an off the top of my head response.<br>  <br>       Granted, there are more music lovers who can't handle Wagner, than there are those who can: well known fact, I guess.<br>  <br>       And for some reason, the Dutchman is one of Wagner's more often performed operas - seems to me.  The reasons for this, I'm not sure.<br>  <br>       But Hoffman if I'm not mistaken, is performed much more infrequently; so, the point being, I would opt for it; because you will most probably have more opportunities in the future to attend a performance of the Dutchman than it.<br>  <br>       And besides, it has a wonderous magic about it, that can't be found in any other opera - at least for me: I just love it.<br>  <br>       There was a film made of it a long time ago; and if you ever get the chance(if you haven't so far)to see it, by all means don't miss it.  Here's a few You Tube excerpts from it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9oK24SFzHw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9oK24SFz...</a><br>  <br>  (low recording level; need to turn up the volume)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1AL8SAmWeQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1AL8SAmW...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnHKm9fn2yo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnHKm9fn2...</a> <br>  <br>       Which ever you choose, know you will enjoy it,<br>  <br>                                                  Alberich|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	I am a huge Wagner fan, but I think you should take your Mum to see the Tales of Hoffman|`|ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	This really is a difficult one. The Dutchman is the most easily digested (and shortest?) Wagnerian opera with the action moving along fairly speedily. I would guess Tales of Hoffman  will be a little longer, but that opera comes in a number of versions and is often cut about. I have to say I prefer Offenbach over Wagner and I think if push has to come to shove would plump for the Tales (1) because I prefer Offenbach, and (2) it is less often performed than the Dutchman.|`|Wl900e6baa	For you I'd say it's about an even choice, both are fine.  If you end up going with your Mother, I'd suggest the Offenbach.  But since your Dad loves opera, go to whichever one is first.  When he sees that you like and appreciate it, he'll probably take you to the second one.  That way you get to see both ... and with someone who is enjoying it with you.|`|9f50f4d3ce3635ccb2e606f87505254daa	I love them both, but Tales of Hoffmann will be more accessible. Lots of great tunes, including the beautiful "Belle nuit" duet!|`|rNqF4gIVaa	I would definitely not take someone to "Der Fliegende Hollander" as a first opera. (Or even second or third).

tDUs971eaa	In a word, YES.<br>  The 2009 budget is 17.8 billion, a 3.48% increase<br>  over 2008. <br>  Scientific research and development may seem worthless<br>  because the practical benefits are uncertain and usually<br>  years in the future. For these reasons the private sector<br>  does not tend to fund basic research.<br>  The PC you are now using would not exist without basic<br>  research into semiconductors and microchips. That basic<br>  research was funded primarily by the US Government.<br>  The US space programs have always been for national<br>  defense purposes. Would you want Russian satellites <br>  overhead without a well funded NASA?|`|DhZ5smpWaa	I think they should continue to fund, but not give them a load of money, just enough to keep things running smoothly. I think space exploration is just amazing, I absolutely love astronomy. It be a tragedy if NASA has to shut down because a lack of funding.|`|PfXuyIT1aa	I'm Australian but I'd still like to comment, I agree with you!

Most guys actually dislike having a gf who is taller than them, especially as girls often wear heels.<br>  If you're feeling insecure about your height you are not alone. A lot of shorter people do- it's the way society makes people feel.

And well done if you should do so.  We have adopted a leopard and a monkey.  And not only animals, we also send donations to help out needy children in other parts of the World.

Just a few pounds/dollars a month can go a long way to eradicating poverty among less fortunate children and also help stamp out animal cruelty.  So go ahead young lady and adopt your penguin and give it a good life.

cbp7Gukbaa	Love hurts,love makes people do stupid things and somtimes violent things or the guy is just a violent type who takes his frustration out on the person they love.Its sucks i know,i practice violence, martial arts but im far from a  violent person ive never hit a girl in my life,the hardest i ever hit sombody was in sparing at kickboxing.At the end of the day men who hit women are cowards and in a real fight they would run away like a fairy.Sorry to hear you have been a victim of it gemma.I wish more girls would take up martial arts and learn how to defend themselves against domestic violence or any kind of violence.I remember once at kickboxing there was this girl about 25 and she was hard as nails i sparred with her a few times and she was just as good as me if not a little bit better.She could beat up allot of ordinary guys no problem.Guys dont have to stronger than you or overpowering you dont have to be affraid of the violent types when your a balckbelt in karate : ) xxx|`|S0XArokKaa	Because women are stronger and I cant defend myself from her.|`|pR4Hwmpbaa	There is no one simple answer. It is a complex problem. <br>  <br>  Abusers have many different reasons why they do what they do. <br>  <br>  <br>  And as far as I am concerned, none of those reasons are a good enough excuse for this type of behavior. <br>  <br>  <br>  Among the theories I've heard that is at the root of the problem is the overall demise of the family unit is to blame (in part) and also the fact that many abusers were themselves treated poorly at one time. They may also have witnessed the same kind of abuse in their own families while growing up. Abuse is often times learned behavior. <br>  <br>  With so many causes it is little wonder that it isn't an even bigger problem than it already is. Thank God it is not, since the situation is way too bad now...|`|7TqFISbtaa	Cause a lot of our generation was brought up in that environment , so we think that it is normal practice ...back in the 80's/90's domestic violence was never heard off...Now a lot of people are coming forward and saying that this is not acceptable any more ..and quite rightly so|`|eCZtVCwaaa	I didn't think it was.

XONUN5H2aa	Jupiter is the greater benefic, so Jupiter placements, aspects, transits, directions, etc are usually not so bad and quite often good.  The problem here is that Jupiter is the traditional ruler of Pisces, the sign opposite to Virgo, so Jupiter is said to be in his detriment in Virgo.  Jupiter is uncomfortable in this sign as Jupiter's nature is expansive, generous, and noble, while Virgo is picky, analytical, and focused.  So the two "energies (for lack of a better word)" are at odds and this makes Jupiter's expression difficult. It is possible, but by no means guaranteed that Jupiter in Virgo would result in a "super Virgo," or one who is excessively picky and fault finding.  This would be a worst case scenario.<br>  <br>  Exactly how this manifests depends on which house Jupiter occupies and which houses Jupiter rules.  This is qualified by aspects and receptions.  If Mercury, ruler of Virgo is in good condition, then this Jupiter isn't so worrisome.  If Mercury is in bad shape, this Jupiter could be a problem. <br>  <br>  The great WWII general George S. Patton had Jupiter in Virgo ruling his MC in mutual reception with an equally debilitated Mercury in Sagittarius ruling his ASC, which gave him great ambition - not so subtly expressed.  He was also well known for insisting on "spit and polish."  Everyone had to be dressed and groomed perfectly as he was himself (in appropriate circumstances).|`|IIa0wtu4aa	John Virgo....?|`|rAD0mL7Saa	can't be bad.

I am amazed and almost hurt by the derogatory comments that you get from smokers almost willing me to start again and telling me that they can stop anytime.  Thing is, I don't even mention it to them, they notice and start saying 'ooooooooo, not smoking then' or 'come on, be social, have a ciggi with us else we will have to leave you on your own'.<br>  <br>  Infuriates me!

PRw9trwQaa	nevermind i just played the game and justice has a third arm under his cape that holds a sword which he used to kill afros dad|`|u9RwzLPnaa	The death happened off camera and Justice challenged him to come and kill him when he gets older. That's why he had his dad's sword. He left it there for him.<br>  <br>  Just because Afro's dad still had his sword in hand is no guarantee that he would live. If you fail to block fast enough you're dead. All it takes is an inch pierce in the heart to kill a man. Cutting off his head is unlikely but it's a cartoon so just go with it.<br>  <br>  hope that helps

A4qtTlKSaa	Its either because they have never been put on DVD or because the dvd's themselves have been discontinued so you will only be able to buy them 2nd hand. Some things only ever came out on VHS and never made it to dvd.<br>  <br>  Try Ebay for them, if you're still unlucky there try the actual sites for these series or the sites for the production company and contact them for information.<br>  <br>  Only search on www.Ebay.com if you have a multi-regional dvd player. Make sure you search on www.ebay.co.uk to find the dvd's. American dvd's are region 1 and won't work on your dvd player.

W0AK2Lumaa	Seriously I need to re watch that...<br>  Cause thats cool
EYqTV2EYaa	Well, to me, it depends on the reason the person has been blocked. Usually, I've talked to contacts of mine that told me they have been unfairly reported, sent harassing emails, and disrespected in their questions. Therefore, if someone were to do that to me, I'd block them because as long as I'm on Yahoo! Answers, I don't want to be disturbed. That means I can relate to other people as well. However, I agree about the disagreement subject. I would never block anyone for disagreeing with me because that's what the thumbs-down is for, but I would sure enough block someone that disrespects me and continues to do so in the process. I however, disagree with what you said about them 'not having the right to block that person' because, well, people can do what they please. It's a natural right. See, you can probably disagree with that action, but you can't say they don't have the right because obviously, they do. I'm not disagreeing with you in a negative way by the way. lol. After spending most of my time on this site, I've noticed one thing I truly disliked about blocking. I hate it when someone disagrees with my answer, curses me out for it via email, then block me before I have the chance to respond. I give my response with my alternate email, which was unbeknownst to them. Now THOSE are the people I believe that take the site too seriously because it's pointless nonsense. To all the people that would send my potential hate mail in the future, if you're going to send me hate mail, at least give me a chance to respond because if not the case, typing your message was a waste of your time, and a waste of mine reading it, right? Again, pointless. lol.|`|AA11989999	Maybe you have reported too many people for your own ideas of what a "violation" or "abuse" is? ........It might be more than mere opinion, dude, some people have had the hassle of their accounts suspended or terminated because of narrow-minded or immature people with "different opinions".

Also trolls as well.|`|rEWZWZi5aa	no they have reasons|`|5D4T6h7waa	people who block other people here don't like to hear the truth, and that's all there is to it. Unless its a troll, because they are just annoying.|`|mEs0n9XTaa	If someone blocks you they had their reasons. Why let that bother you? Strangers in this e-life should not matter in your real-life. That is how I live.<br>  <br>  ? ? Inez/Inescia ? ?|`|DhZ5smpWaa	Yes, yes I do. If you block someone, you should a have a pretty damn good reason to. Like harassment, other than that. Why do it?|`|zDJVWlscaa	I can answer questions even when I've been blocked.<br>  <br>  It's funny knowing that they're pissed off 'cos they can't do anything about it.|`|Xnhm6bWnaa	thats because people are uptight and need to get laid.|`|Nipbluclaa	Yeah thats retarded,<br>  And whats worse is when you get reported on an answer,<br>  There is no justice >:[|`|NgxJDIFsaa	i just block potential trolls|`|ukRpBJ6Daa	lol<br>  <br>  i just block potential trolls<br>  <br>  XD<br>  <br>  you're not one of them|`|AvmKTcJNaa	Yeah, I know what you mean but in the same time it really depends. Some people are on here with real problems like. "My grandmother has cancer and they operated on the wrong lung. Who can I sue?" and someone answers "F*** it! She's a dead old hag!"- you see the exceptions?<br>  <br>  Or if someone says "My child has been kidnapped and I done everything to find her. What else is there?" a potential blocked answer would be "Admit you killed her! We all know you did it!"<br>  <br>  A lot for time it's due to over sensitive people but other times some people are just asking for it. You can't say things like that without knowing you're hurting their feelings. <br>  <br>  I don't block simply because I don't ask personal questions. Others have no other place to go. <br>  <br>  lol Just my opinion! If you block me then you're just a hypocrite :-D|`|UnqAjpVOaa	yeah I agree with you, some people do take this too seriously and are on here way to much, most of the time there is no reason to block, because people don't even know each other. Sometimes people block for stupid reasons as well, like they don't like your answer or something stupid like that.|`|IRtvIophaa	Yeh Sum People On Here Do Take It Way 2 Seriously, But Who Needs Those People Anywayz So Block Away! Lol|`|uRrLjFp9aa	yup i agree. <br>  they should definitely lighten up|`|tSwCd5kvaa	You're right, but blocking you is trivial. Ignore them.|`|U1hGMckKaa	i agree. these people are too ignorant to see how stupid they really are. nothing but a bunch of liberals.|`|Vf9n9OmFaa	yeah, i totally agree with you.|`|qLvhoRpsaa	No. <br>  <br>  They blocked you for a reason. <br>  <br>  That does not stop you from your opinion, free speech, and thousands and thousands of other Y!A users who do not find you either nasty, ignorant, or a troll. <br>  <br>  I am sure that there are many more reasons for the block. Deal with it. Life goes on. <br>  <br>  If it is someone in particular and you do not have a clue as to why, then privately email and ask them.<br>  <br>  Peace:)|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Sometimes. But the person they're blocking may also turn out to be a complete douche or some racist annoying sonofabetch. <br>  <br>  Depends, but i agree somewhat.

SqzoZe4Laa	You know, Alex Lifeson has a new series of lessons that you can download that include all the classics, but I believe start with limelight and spirit of radio, those would be challenging, but not too challenging. Just find his site and it should tell about it. If you can play Rush, you can play anything. The 15 years I spent playing drums I still never "nailed" a rush song, although I have to say I came mighty close, as close as anyone could come to emulating Neil Peart. But seriously, check out the new line of Alex Lifeson's downloadable lessons. -john in iowa
AhNkKIMlaa	i think you do draw good,i have seen better but then i sit and read manga all day. I think you should try drawing on the computer with a tablet, because the one thing that lets down the drawings is some of the pages is some of the coloring especially on page 1.<br>  <br>  My sister draws a comic (shes is very popular some how...), and shes not that good at drawing them but people love reading her story's so if you have a good story line then you can do any thing :D|`|YilnCIwuaa	It was great but you can improve it, right?

E! news also showed her at disney land with the kids and they all looked really happy!|`|sVkBdQ28aa	She released Circus (her latest album) on her 27th birthday, and she's just started her tour for that a couple days ago. It's fantastic btw. <br>  <br>  Her first song from it, Womanizer, had a record for the biggest jump in the Top 100. She shot to number one, which was her first since Baby One More Time. Circus also went to number one, so it makes it her fourth number one (blackout maxxed out at number 2). <br>  <br>  On a personal scale she's off the drugs, but not getting to see her kids much. KFed has them, and he's going out with this girl called Victoria, who's a bit trampy. Britney's paying off loads of money to her dad and brother because they helped her when she was in need and now they're expected buckets of money for it. Jerks. Also KFat is getting a load of money from her.<br>  <br>  She sung a track with Madonna on her Sticky and Sweet tour. It was cute.<br>  <br>  You can find that duet and Britney's first date of the album on youtube.|`|e8o2eP6Zaa	She's pretty well right now.

a5BhsLeQaa	If anything it's the other way around!!|`|zkovxRseaa	who is Aguilar?|`|PlDUV89paa	Yeah i agree with most people who answered this question already...Christina has been around for years and years..Lady GaGa has been around for the last year....Lady GaGa may have some decent sounding songs but when you see her on stage she looks like a complete idiot<br>  <br>  Also i think if she wants to sound decent live then she has to quit it with all the dancing, cause she just loses her breath and you have no idea what she is singing...Christina is more classic...GaGa is just a tart|`|kGkUG0fKaa	Christina had been out waaaaay before this lady gag character|`|dovVcDPmaa	To copy someone is a *compliment.

u5eHNj0taa	I think he did
wCdILHl6aa	He's okay looking, he isn't spectacular. It's just the youngster preteens who fall all over themselves for him because they are obsessed with the whole Twilight craze! I enjoyed reading the novels, it was pretty well written, I loved the romantic aspect of it, but in no way understand how it has become such an overwhelming fad...it's nuts!!|`|nLdSwOQLaa	i think he looks ugly. i honestly think the only reason ppl like him is cuz hes "edward". i mean u didnt c ppl falling ovr him when he was in harry potter.|`|IUKeSykiaa	OMG<br>  I HAVE FOUND ANOTHER FEMALE HUMAN BEING WHO ISNT IN LOVE WITH ROBERT PATTINSON<br>  im shocked<br>  your joking!<br>  i dont think he is good looking at all and i dont like twilight either!!|`|Vm0iVpYPaa	LOL i don't even no who he is.

No one was in love with Robert when he was playing Cedric Diggory in the Harry Potter series... haha. <br>  <br>  <br>  Blame Edward Cullen.|`|QziRcmTJaa	NOOOOOOOOO. you're definately not alone here. all my friends at school didn't even like him, except for one. yep, ONE. lmfao x]<br>  <br>  i don't know why girls fall for him. it's probably because he's playing Edward Cullen, the perfect guy, and they thought Robert is the same. and what's so sex about his hair?! he didn't even was them!<br>  <br>  honestly, Taylor Lautner & Kellan Lutz are waaaaay hotter than him. at least they love acting, not like that... guy.|`|N6t1q65xaa	Robert who? :)<br>  I know him, he's ok but not the best actor you can find.

Agree with the other girl, it's all him being the "Edward Cullen" character.  Most girls i know are in love with Edward and don't know who Robert is as a person when you call him by his real name.  But yes, he was rather good looking in his Harry Potter days.|`|b536895bf6c779e662d180730661813faa	No, I completely agree.<br>  He doesn't deserve all the attention he's getting and his hair is pretty gross and greasy. On TV Interviews he even says things like he's never even read Twilight and doesn't care much about the book. He never knew what it was about or how such a book could become so famous.<br>  <br>  It drew all the attention towards him and he acts like an asshole.I don't think he's ugly but hes undeserving and that makes him a hideous person. Both inside and out.|`|x7fXMjHRaa	i think he is hot and all. but really all these fans ruin it for ppl who like him as a person not edward cullen...they just think he is edward cullen and everything he does they judge him based on him being edward cullen in the movie...im just sick of ppl talking about twilight all the time why cant they get a life|`|N9vwPaPsaa	NO! Robert Pattison is ugly.<br>  People only like him because they are told he is handsom. People are told he is cool. People are told he is the next big thing. <br>  He looks like a homeless person. If i was earing a salary like his I would be getting my hair cut, buying a razor and at least making myself look like some one respectable.|`|IPSiruS2aa	No you aren't alone, I dont find him attractive. He did look good in twilight, but he looks kind of weird when he's not in the movie. Sorry to all you rob fans.|`|d3E1Dedoaa	Thank god I am not alone! Don't worry, I don't find him all that attractive either! I mean, nothing about him is really interesting and he just doesn't really appeal to me!

They understand without words the especial trouble that is weighing upon the heart of a friend, and are frequently able to explain its cause and banish its effects. <br>  <br>  Their wills are so dominant, their sym-pathies so quick and kindly, and their clairvoyant power so marked, that they rarely ever fail in their work of minister-ing to the sorrowful.|`|rzyrxVw8aa	Sorry ,The guy you have chosen was not good,he wanted to use you but today he has fulfilled his wish but now still you like him &want to wins his heart i will give you tips   1)move around his life without talking him  2)Try to look more beautiful than before 3)Make his worst  enemy your best boyfriend.these three tips will help you.|`|HSSuKNCUaa	"Playing games" with Aries' heart is overrated! In fact, Aries doesn't like it when you consciously play. The key to Aries is in the reality of it all. You shouldn't "pretend" to be hard to get - you need to be hard to get. You already have it in you; clearly you don't want to be used. That's enough.<br>  <br>  Just because he got what he wanted that one time, doesn't make you easy FROM NOW ON :-) just do what you did before it happened, and when he wants to try again, tell him honestly that you're a little weary of going fast. That you don't regret that night, but you're also careful with yourself because frankly you're a catch. It's just the truth. You deserve better than to be anyone's toy, and so does he. As long as he knows that your intimacy is not something you take lightly, he will continue to see it as a challenge. Don't tease him, just show that you respect yourself (and your heart) just as much as you enjoy his company. <br>  <br>  In the end wether he is Aries or not, it all comes down to dignity; you don't want to be used by any of the signs. Just do what you did before; flirt with him, enjoy his company, show him you enjoy his company. Just show him you respect yourself too much to now just jump in head first because it happened once.

HiS1zhXUaa	pour all your household products down the sink and then go outside and breathe the  fresh air......|`|971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	There are no household products that you can get high off of "safely".|`|vNfckAYCaa	i saw a guy die from sniffing household products...<br>  you are an idiot....<br>  go get some mental help|`|yvPDwL5naa	Don't sniff anything...Pretty dangerous. I don't know about "household products," but there are some OTC type things.<br>  <br>  You probably know about nitrous out of whip cream cans, but this also can be dangerous.<br>  <br>  Nutmeg can be used to create a hallucinogenic experience. Might want to be off the next day though, as it can cause quite a bit of fatigue...do some research on the nutmeg on your own, as it's not my recommendation due to side effects.<br>  <br>  DXM like in Robitussin of course can be used as a tryptamine, but don't get carried away.<br>  <br>  BUT, the best option i would say...<br>  <br>  [imho, a combination of <br>     1. not being well known<br>     2. not being NEARLY as dangerous as any of the other answers you'll probably hear about from this question<br>     3. really putting you in another world<br>     4. not requiring a lot of recupe time...(a night of sleep is fine)]<br>  <br>  ...is DIMENHYDRINATE (Dramamine).  It's a deliriant in larger doses, but it doesn't actually take very much more than recommended. Recommended is 50 or 100 mg every 4 hrs as needed. Normal dosage for intended intoxication is usually between 200 and 1200 mg (so 4 to 24 pills usually).  The experience is very dream-like.  You won't really do anything that you would never consider doing normally (like anything unsafe), but you'll do things that will seem to make sense at the time, then you'll later realize they don't... AT ALL. <br>  <br>    For example, I took 500mg (10 pills, and plenty for the first time) and took a clock down off a wall (I have no idea why), rearranged the items on my back porch and in my kitchen (e.g. We have a wooden bowl with fruit in it...I carefully removed the fruit and placed it in a different bowl and placed everything back how it was, only switching the two bowls...HAHA!), etc.<br>  <br>    The best way I can think to describe it is this:<br>  <br>  You know how, in a dream, you just "know" certain things, without reason?  Like maybe you're in a house in your dream and to look at the house you wouldn't recognize it at all.  It's a house you've never seen in your waking life, but in that dream you don't even have to think about it...you just know that it's YOUR house. It's a given...<br>  <br>  It's quite a unique experience, not quite like tripping on traditional hallucinogens or anything like that. Some call deliriants the "true hallucinogens" because you may actually have whole conversations with people who aren't even there.  I never experienced anything like this but I did do the thing with the fruit because I was sure that my mother left me a note saying to do so (it felt like doing a chore when i was a kid..haha).  My friend said he talked to me and our other buddy for about an hour one night and upon realizing he was alone proceeded to laugh about it for another hour, but he took 22 pills.<br>  <br>  The LD50 (lethal dose for 50 percent of animals that dose was given to) is 500 mg/kg. So if you weigh 150lbs (about 68 kg), you've got about a 50/50 chance of death if you were to take 34 grams...or 680 pills!  But that was an average of mice, rats, rabbits, and rhesus monkeys, which tend to be a good indicator in humans but have been known to vary sometimes, so just don't go taking 500 damn pills!<br>  <br>  My advice - drink a few glasses of water with the pills as they can cause some dehydration (but really no more than a few cups of coffee does) and be able to be in a dimly lit area because deliriants can cause pupil dilation.<br>  <br>  As always, do your own research and make calculated risks when putting anything in your body that's intended to intoxicate, but I say give it a shot and have fun.<br>  <br>  Stay safe and if you're around anyone tell them what you're doing BEFORE you do it.  AND FOR CHRIST'S HOLY MOTHER'S VAGINA'S SAKE...DON'T ******* DRIVE!!!<br>  <br>     -rsd

SqzoZe4Laa	Anus* licking* butt*holes. That's what I call them, but basically when someone surfs up over the top toward the stage, the "take them into custody" and lead them  back around and into the crowd. (Unless someone in the band says "NO, NOT THAT ONE, we're keeping her, take her around back", then she get's to go backstage if he can get someone to chase her down quick enough before she disappears back in to the crowd. Those guys up front can be pricks, or the can be supercool, it just depends on who they are. I was at the BACK of the venue in Davenport, Iowa, at a Primus concert (with the meat puppets). My friends were spread out all over, but I had found this nice little I beam that extended from the groud up into the ceiling for stabilization of the building. Well, it had a pylon at the bottom (concrete), and I found that I if I stood on it with my left foot and hung onto it with my left arm, I could elevate myself at least 3 feet, allowing myself to see OVER the crowd. Everything was cool for about 20 minutes until the largest African American I have EVER seen in my entire life came up from behind me and bodyslammed me OFF of the pylon and onto the floor about 9 feet away. Thx, dude. You don't have to take "bouncer" so seriously. That was a cool old venue, saw the OLD Dave Matthews band there with Dionne Ferris.

If not, I think it'll come down to one of them and either Allison or Alexis. But right now, it seems like they could be the Top 4, in whatever order. It's too early to really predict,though,because sometimes early frontrunners start to feel the pressure of the high expectations on them and start to backslide (Carly Smithson,Michael Johns,etc), while underdogs have gone to to win the whole thing (David Cook). So you never know how contestants are going to continue performing or how the votes are going to go,or anything. It's really unpredictable.

EuwjIJ3Zaa	When a composite charts shows major aspects such as that, it's obviously really beneficial for the relationship.  The Kite Pattern specifically will give you guys an outlet for expressing the good energies you share from the Grand Trine.<br>  <br>  I can't tell from your wording specifically what the Apex is, but I think you're saying it is Mercury. For a healthy relationship with someone, be it romantic or friendship, that's a good aspect to have, as it will help you talk things out more clearly, despite it being in opposition to your moon.  <br>  <br>  With many trines in a relationship, and major positive aspects such as those, people may have a tendency to feel 'at peace' with one another.  You can compliment each others styles, and furthermore, you may even feel that you are stronger, and more able by being with one another.<br>  <br>  For the other aspect, when Venus is in opposition to Pluto, this can be a very intense relationship, as well as transformative, but keep an eye on getting into power struggles.  It's also really beneficial that the aspects are being shown through mostly personal planets. <br>  <br>  Regardless, anytime that major aspects show up in a composite chart, it's greatest benefit is that it allows for a proper outlet. No relationship is perfect, and it's not so much about how you feel, in as much as how you react when you're together.  With many trines, as well as the oppositions from the Kites, you guys have a focal points for release.  The same rules still apply, that trines can be taken for granted, and overlooked, but with a few oppositions or squares, it allows the energy a healthy outlet.<br>  <br>  Check and see which houses your planets fall in.  For composite/synastry, I think the houses are extremely important.  Sometimes people know that they are doing something wrong, but they aren't exactly sure where/why, and this is only amplified, when two people are trying to figure things out together...  The houses can point to where the energy of aspects will specifically be manifesting in your relationship.  This is ofcourse more important for long term.<br>  <br>  You may want to look at your Jupiter aspects, as this has a lot to do with the amount of energy that is brought together by two people. The bad aspect of these trines, is that you could have a tendency to become lazy.  A Jupiter square Mars or Sun for example, honestly wouldn't be that bad.  It will prevent a 'rut'.  You may also want to focus more on the area of oppositions you guys share.<br>  <br>  This isn't something that is very common.  I only know one person with whom I have 2 kites in our composite.  He's one of my best friends.  Regardless, the two of you will probably find a lot of inspiration from one another, as well as a feeling of ease in each others company.

6NZeItMAaa	You must be in the cusp. The Sun enters Scorpioon  about the 23d of October, and departs from the sign on or about the 22d of November. The Sun on entering the sign should be given six days before coming into full touch and action with the influence of the sign.<br>  <br>   A person born between the dates of the 23d and the 29th of October would not receive the full central results of the sign's individuality, as he would be born when the Sun was on the edge of the sign. This is known as the Cusp, and its nature and im-pulses partake of the sign the Sun has just passed through and out from, and the native will also partake of the attributes of the sign of the Zodiac the Moon is located in at the time of birth.|`|32P3hG0Laa	There is no such thing. What you are describing is impossible. You are either a Libra or a Scorpio. You need to get your birth time and exact birth day & year & place and look it up online.

AA12376180	I feel Darius Milhaud has fallen to the wayside. I very seldom if ever hear any of his compostions on the radio and have never heard a live orchestra play any of his music.<br>  <br>  Another is Xaver Scharwenka, I love his piano concerto, although I don't play it. I have only heard his music via recordings.|`|ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	I am absolutely with you on York Bowen. Any one who likes the piano concertos of Rachmaninov will love those by Bowen (once upon a time called 'the English Rachmaninov') (and no, Yahoo, I will not spell it with a double f at the end)<br>  <br>  I would also advocate William Alwyn (could anyone fail to be moved by his Lyra Angelica?)<br>  <br>  Casting my net further afield, and back in time, I'd like to advocate Hummel - again, wonderful piano concertos, and that wizard of piano music, Charles-Victor Alkan.|`|CuMYdQV6aa	Frank Martin. His "Petite Symphonie Concertante" may have a dull title but it is a sublime work.<br>  <br>  Arthur Koechlin. His "Jungle Book" music (nothing to do with the film score) is delightful.<br>  <br>  I was interested by the comment re Ketelby. He could hardly be called a profound composer but his orchestration was both deft and clever. I recall seeing Simon Rattle and the CBSO performing his "In a Persian Market". It was clear that both Rattle and the orchestra were really enjoying it!|`|WyWHvUXJaa	Ketelby - wonderful (and a distant uncle of mine)|`|ZRRWcO1vaa	I would agree with Bowen and Enescu.<br>  <br>  I would like to add Carl Nielsen (for his symphonic work) and Jean Francaix (for his chamber music) to the list. Also, film composers like Nino Rota and Erich Korngold. Each wrote fantastic film scores as well as music in the absolute sense. <br>  <br>  Research and enjoy!|`|oSXgtqYCaa	Zemlinsky wrote a superb  trio for clarinet, cello and piano.<br>  <br>  Another interesting composer is Frank Martin. His compositions are angular and you might listen more than once, but it is great writing. He is not exactly 'lesser known' but I am surprised at how many are unaware of his writing.<br>  <br>  There is a wonderful man named Hakim, who became the organist after Messaien at  the Church of La Sainte-Trinite. He is known mostly for his improvisational skill but he just wrote a tuneful and energetic  piece for organ.It's been released in the last month with Faythe Freese as organist, though I don't remember the recording company. It's fantastic! <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you, and I will look up Lambert and Bowen, as I am unfamiliar with either. Thank you.|`|eXMI11kkaa	does john tavener count? his "song for athene" is amazing.|`|zEoRcL91aa	Schumann, especially Clara Schumann.|`|70jNDiIiaa	I fully agree with Del, I think that Monteverdi and Caldara have been unfairly neglected - both composed music of great sublimity, and deserve more recognition.<br>  <br>  I feel that the Czech Baroque composer Jan Dismas Zelenka (1679 - 1745) is also sadly underestimated - though to be fair, he was only rediscovered as recently as the 1970s.<br>  <br>  Zelenka's impressive output includes 20 masses, over 50 psalm settings, several oratorios and a number of instrumental works - including a set of six trio sonatas for 2 oboes, bassoon and basso continuo - absolutely stupendous stuff, most unconventional - indeed, a "Bohemian" style in more ways than one!<br>  <br>  Fingers crossed Zelenka becomes more well-known as time goes by...<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Hafwen.|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	I would (and do!) advocate:<br>  <br>  Kalevi Aho - the true 21st-century heir to Sibelius's throne.<br>  Frank Bridge - a truly original composer who is totally overshadowed by the fact that he was Britten's teacher.<br>  Antonio Caldara - Contemporary of Vivaldi and composer of some of the most ravishing vocal music you will ever hear.<br>  George Enescu. Possibly the greatest musician of the 20th century - violinist, pianist, conductor, composer and teacher (he taught Menuhin). Forget the Romanian Rhapsodies (fun, but not representative), he wrote some of the most original music of the first half of the 20th century.<br>  Vagn Holmboe - a kind of Danish Shostakovich - only better and more consistent. He wrote 15 amazing symphonies, 20 string quartets, many concertos and a wealth of other music which deserves wider currency.<br>  Joseph Martin Kraus - Conteporary of Mozart in Sweden. A very original voice and composer of some truly outstanding music.<br>  Claudio Monteverdi - possibly the most revolutionary composer of all time (more perhaps even than Beethoven). He more or less 'invented' the Baroque.<br>  Robert Simpson - arguably the greatest British symphonist and composer of quartets of all time.

Contortionists can create the illusion of having "boneless bodies" by specializing in the skills that show off their most flexible joints, with the help of their acting talent and mime skills--like Mr. Bean. Too, regular stretching exercises of the joints, especially as one ages, helps.|`|usRWhMGWaa	HE HAS NO BALLS

There are some confused guys out there, but signs or signs.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Guys are a generally paranoid bunch. If they want to sleep with you they are paranoid you'll not want to sleep with them if you figure this out.

lTHuvCl2aa	Envy and jealousy are very close in meaning, but know that when I say I envy somebody I'm NOT jealous. I've always used it wrong. When I say I envy someone, it's only because I want to do a certain thing that they have done greatly before me. It makes me want to test myself in some sense. See how far I can go in life and even when I'm not able to do what they have done, I don't get mad or jealous. No, I'm truly still amazed by that person.

NrOuDXW4aa	It seems to be the trend to place really well known actors in one off parts in these blockbuster serials.  The Harry Potter movies have always cast big names in each movie in the series to complement the roles of the less well known stars.  This hasn't tended to overshadow the main charactors in the series and I don't think it will happen in the Twilight series either.<br>  <br>  You can expect one or two big names in each of the remaining movies and they won't detract from the series.<br>  <br>  To those who say Dakota Fanning is miss cast and too young for the part I say that you have to understand that this isn't a traditional vampire movie.  Yes in a remake of bram stokers dracula it would be woeful casting to have DF as a vampire but this is a Teen romance and so she will fit in okay.<br>  <br>  Casting a few big names in these movies is a win for all concerned, the big stars help create interest from movie goers who otherwise might not go to see the film and the stars get the chance to widen their fan base.<br>  <br>  Robert Pattinson won't be overshadowed by DF, if he is considering the age difference he should maybe retire.|`|usRWhMGWaa	OHHHHMYYYYYGOOOOOOD<br>  you have to be kidding me?...<br>  how can dakota fanning play jane???<br>  jane is the only character i cared about n there puttin her in it.<br>  n besides she is a kid n i thought kids arnt supposed to be vampires so y would the volturi keep her n her brother.<br>  so stupid<br>  they need som1 reaaaaaly hott to play jane<br>  like angelina jolie ;]|`|NGFzCWTBaa	i really hope they do not continue on placing A-list actors in the movie<br>  its like placing Brad Pitt in the next Harry Potter movie<br>  as for the rest of the characters in the book, i hope that underground GOOD actors are choosen<br>  =]|`|AA12354369	to be honest, the only new part that I cared about was Jane.

r7sgshwKaa	The girls tried out for a wet tshirt bikini contest and lost. Tiffany flipped out because the mc accused her of throwing ice and she didn't. She went ape **** because it was someone else and she wanted an apology but she didn't get one. Then things escalated when Boston went backstage and tried to find the mc to get him to apologize for the way he treated Tiffany. He pretty much told her to shut the **** up because she was being kind of loud. Then the little Amber got pissy drunk and started pole dancing but nobody was paying any attention to her and after that it was just plain all out war. The girls all went outside and I think Aliyah started pulling little Amber's hair and then she just got a beat down from everyone. I think her and Tiffany really went at it. It went off with the cops coming to their room and asking them about what happened. Im pretty sure she pressed charges. Oh well.

2Ifa1Qd4aa	After a game of volley ball at the beach, my friends, 5 girls and 7 guys including myself sat in circle, san tanning and started chatting. The session developed into truth or dare.<br>  <br>  The twist was, I survived my truth very well. However, when one of the girls was asked to dare. That was when my most humiliating experience was about to develop.<br>  <br>  Her dare was to massage me in my underwear. That meant that i had to strip for her in front of all, in public (the beach was luckily secluded.) If I refused, that will mean she had to have a penalty.<br>  <br>  Then, the guys came to her rescue. They started to rip my clothes off, and soon, I was pinned down in my grey briefs. The girl was shy and gingerly massaged my body (more like touching). Then, the girls directed her to sit on my legs and work her way down. When her hands arrived at my waist, the guys rolled me over and a spare pair of hands yanked my underwear off!<br>  <br>  But the ordeal was not over. In my state of desperation, all I heard was laughter and i finally saw my pair of briefs held high in the air by one of my friend, as if it were a trophy; and he was running towards the water as I followed. then, he deliberately flunk it into a crashing wave.<br>  <br>  They all had a good laugh as they saw me surface, clad in my wet pair of underwear. The boys were laughing hard when they pointed at my briefs that seemed to outline my privates.<br>  <br>  If all endings had a happy ending, I had a relationship with one of the girls not long later.|`|r9HGB4Y4aa	Mine:<br>  <br>  One time I was walking around the house. Some visitors of my family were there. Suddenly, ti got so hot my feet were so sweaty. I took my slippers of then suddenly... I stepped on my puppy's poo! It was all over my foot. "CODY (my pup)!" I had shouted. The visitors laughed because when I walked, I slipped on my dog's pee. OMG. So embarrassing.<br>  <br>  Parents:<br>  <br>  My mom was going out with her friends. She didn't want one of my them to come. Let's call her Jane. So she texted (hides her real name) Lea, saying "let's not bring Jane". But then her cell phone rang and a forwarded message! She had accidentally sent the message to Lea! She was so embarrassed she didn't dare see her again.|`|TBZK5q78aa	Beating off to porn and my mom said, "Boy, what the hell are you doing?"<br>  <br>  And my grandma saw my you-know-what when I left the bathroom and she started acting all weird...<br>  <br>  Also my mom caught me talking to myself in a full engaged conversation... She said, "who you on the phone with in there. You talking to yourself?"|`|eywxi2HPaa	well, embarrasing moment for me is when I was dancing a table and then fall off and landed on my butt!!<br>  <br>  and a funny parent one is when we had to push my brothers car to get it started and then as my dad was walking he fell down on his butt! It was hilarious because then he just sat there! lol|`|zvAfMgf3aa	the police was after me once cause I was speedy, I fulled over, and got out to show him the license & registration , then.

I'm a girl. <br>  <br>  We were in the gymnasium because of practices for a school play. Then I excused myself to go to the C.R.but it turns out I entered the boys bathroom. There were a few guys doing their "business" and well as they say, "Then the rest was history."<br>  <br>  Everyone outside saw me ran out of door. Embarrassing much..........|`|hXIELxeYaa	Once, I laughed so hard and pooped in my pants. Then it smelled and my friends asked who farted.

Hard to explain how some womens under mysteriously made it from the couch all the way the way to the closet near the bathroom. its kind of a shame i cant remember who that was either.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	I was on the bus going to work at the Mall Of America and i was eating a twix, a piece of the chocolate broke off and fell onto my black works pants, I just wiped it off of me..so i thought.<br>  <br>  <br>  I went to the mall but stopped in an old job to see old co-workers, i turned around and my friend asked what was on my butt...i looked in the mirror and there was that damn choclate from the twix smeared right down the crack of my @ss on black pants, prominent and looking like a shat stain!<br>  <br>  OMG I walked damn near half way around the mall and fast too and it was sooo crowded. I felt like dying at the thought of people staring at my @ss and thinkin i shat on myself..it really did look like a shat stain...i mean just smeared down my @ss, the crack! ugh!|`|hEx2hBTCaa	when i was with a girl in my room in bed my mom walked in even tho i thought they were out of town and i screamed WTF and like jumped out of bed b4 i thought about that i was naked with a hard on and then had 2 get back in again while my mom was yelling at me and the girl.<br>  <br>  I dare anyone 2 top this and have it still b true|`|lxe8tTyNaa	Like 3 weeks ago I was skating home and there were a couple of hot girls like right before my house, so as i move on to the street I fell off my board and my board skid under someones car. Then I had to get under the car to get my board. And those two girls were just staring at me like I was stupid haha.

I swear.|`|PK498w0Saa	Fancy a bit of trivia?<br>  Humpty Dumpty was not actually seen as an egg until Lewis Carrol's, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In historical terms, he was actually a cannon which really did exist, mounted on top of a wall in Colchester (UK). He fell down and got broken during a war and as he was relied on so much it had a terrible effect. <br>  So there you go... humpty dumpty was a cannon and not an egg.|`|9wORP6CEaa	I DIDN'T DO IT, <br>  NOBODY SAW ME DO IT, <br>  YOU CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and yeah the guy who said Humpty Dumpty was a cannon is correct. <br>  I learnt this is History and also was told this when we went to England.|`|e9bv4ijlaa	I wasn't even there officer you can't prove a thing !!|`|ET3fB5G8aa	I wanna talk to my lawyer,|`|LrYCJq5yaa	uh , uh ...... the clown took 1 too many E tabs and didn`t realise until too late that the `yolk` was in Him.... :)|`|ZjINxNniaa	Ok...i admit...i pushed him =[|`|AA11333096	I want proof.|`|n1y67ZNuaa	i was hungry ok..?<br>  <br>  <br>  :(|`|RPCUJt06aa	might be in the past,but not sure in future.....,Since I'm  a  person who thinks of only the present,that is,I enjoy each and every moment of life...n make others around me also enjoy....|`|EcNneP5Caa	what was he doing up on the darn wall in the first place.his dumbutt shouldnt be on no walls. serves him right|`|8a855a9399c346980e74d5afafe6900baa	he came out of a chickens *** .. who cares how he fell/ got pushed .. hes gone and the world is as it should be ..|`|onaBjeFzaa	ya i wanted an omellete... i was the one who exchanged weewilywinky's raymond suit with a nightgown too...|`|eRXaVBzJaa	DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING GOOD TO DO OTHER THAN FALSELY ACCUSING PEOPLE???|`|JA6DtbPJaa	i didnt push him.....i shot him with my paintball gun  :)|`|5wAAnZPYaa	You are a liar!

wmBK9uASaa	Drop my draws get on all 4s and scratch like a dog,letting out the odd "Oooo" and "Oh oh Ooo",then get dressed and walk away|`|WWCfdgd0aa	i would scratch it lol<br>  its natural<br>  everyone does it|`|toueud6gaa	There is nothing worse than an itchy *** and not being able to scratch it. How often do you see men walk down the street and casually adjust their crown jewels so that they are sitting right lol.<br>  The thing that you see where I live is young lads standing there and have both hands down there tracksuit bottoms playing with their balls I kid you not. The other fad is that people actually go out shopping in their pyjamas truth. If you do not believe me watch Jeremy Kyle I am sure some of them will be on there.|`|154fb2409db62658ea286ba112b10798aa	Now that is funny, never thought of that (but truthfully I don't get an itchy bum often) but if I do...I;m going with your plan.|`|J1J47FIAaa	I'd scratch it.<br>  <br>  If it itches then I'm gonna scratch it.|`|a577675893457f8844900f790e549222aa	Hide, lol|`|nlKZRNqmaa	I would try to hide somewhere and scratch it|`|lSGhyEneaa	I would pretend to fall on my butt and slide to get up.|`|XdAtjwM1aa	I would scratch it but then hide to sniff my fingers|`|fwrfIxIaaa	usually my pants are in the way so i pull them down to help the scratching of the itch|`|AA11333096	o.o Wow, I should try that some time!<br>  <br>  I just do it secretly...|`|1S2dDfXuaa	um no comment haha :]|`|1DTVKkoBaa	id just scratch it.
C4BJ3yLWaa	As a Christian I would doubt it.  I might meet for a casual date.  I could never get serious.<br>  Have you ever visited the R&S section at YA?  There are some really messed up people there.|`|To5mQxOPaa	depends on how religious she was, it if was to the extent that she was homophobic and was close minded, then no. but if she takes some tips from the book instead of letting it run her life, then i don't care.|`|UvPUopA8aa	I'm not a really strong christian. I don't live by the bible but I do have christian beliefs. I think I could as long as that person can respect my beliefs. And not push their beliefs on me I think it could work.|`|fJd2J19faa	I would for the simple fact I believe in the right to choose.Individual rights. Basic human rights.My beliefs are my own. By the way I am religious.|`|5Jf3qA4vaa	HELL no! hahaha.<br>  nah i wouldn't care.<br>  i don't even know if believe in God myself actually... i just believe in whatever floats my boat....|`|2kR4sX48aa	(vise versa for me since i am christian) but yes i would.|`|dk8y4eseaa	I don't know|`|zPgbpSgHaa	Of course not.  Our values, beliefs, and priorities are obviously very different.   How would we ever make it work?|`|Ps9eOIchaa	I'm Agnostic,and yes i would go out with an Atheist.I would also go out with a Christian.Either way i respect both of their opinions,religion does not define a persons character.And they should respect my views|`|zqc0ugtlaa	I wouldn't. Most atheists don't even respect religion, they often mock and make fun of christianity. "Why do you even believe..." "That's ridiculous there's no proof of..."<br>  <br>  I rather not deal with them.|`|9rhqD6Hpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  It depends on guy not by his views.<br>  <br>  If you like him so much then must go out & forget his all negative things but can remind him to rectify his negative things in good way. <br>  <br>  Bye & tc<br>  Mayank|`|MyRjr1Z6aa	I'm bouncing between both sides so I guess anything would be alright with me. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't let religion get in the way of real love anyway.|`|diChry3Vaa	Actually I dated a very right wing, very conservative girl for a short while.  And I'm quite far on the left.|`|3gljWitCaa	nope<br>  i have atheists as friends but i wouldnt date one|`|95Xn7PkJaa	Sure, it doesn't matter to me.|`|hXIELxeYaa	If they're trying to shove their religion down my throat, hell NO,|`|ge5x9NHxaa	Yeah so long as both of us will respect our self.|`|a40380daa8f8c7c0761b53d6ecfddb40aa	I probably most likely wouldn't date an atheist. I don't care who believes in what; people are people after all. But I do believe in God... strongly. I would hope that my love would feel the same so we could support each other in that area just as much as we support each other with everything else.|`|mBlcD6sRaa	yes<br>  <br>  drinks and a strip club would be a hell of a night|`|m3ThrbDMaa	(You set me up for this one...I got a funny one again this time...are you ready?  get set?  okay...in answer to the question "Would I go out with an Atheist?" the totally improv'd at this moment answer must be...<br>  <br>  "Heaven Forbid!"<br>  <br>  (ta tum tum...)|`|V8sDPf2Eaa	sure as long she didnt try to convert me to be an atheist or liberal|`|VALxlwYSaa	Yes, <br>  Because everyone's beliefs are different and I can't change that.|`|ADWIWx5Baa	Yes.
0Cq3QlDIaa	I havn't heard of any new song called "Resolution Road".  If you mean Dylan's "Desolation Row" then of corse I love it.  Bob Dylan (along with MCR) is one of my favorite singers/songwriters.  So of course I was super-excited when I heard they were doing a cover of it.  <br>  <br>  I love both versions!|`|6IjBUqAfaa	Desolation row? <br>  it rocks :D|`|mDsZtyMmaa	its titled desolation row, not resolution road...haha|`|C0h5Enwyaa	..Do you mean their Dylan cover Desolation Row?

AA12238926	hum, that is strange that he said he was remodling. all i know is the 2 story store is the highest upgrade.|`|lzEuuseJaa	When you have Nookington's, the biggest store, Nook will ask about a month later what you like in a store. Here is how to answer according to what you'd like:<br>  <br>  Variety = Stays Nookington's<br>  Balance = Downgrades to Nookway<br>  Good Hours = Downgrades to Nook 'n' Go<br>  <br>  When you answer Variety, Nook's answer seems off, but it will stay Nookington's, he's asked me on several occasions. If someone else has a character in your town, be sure to tell them the answer to give.<br>  <br>  You can work back up to Nookington's if your store is downgraded. (But I need all those flowers! lol)
K4GiKOhPaa	In Florida several years ago, a 70+ year old woman was arrested for the murder of her husband of 50+ years. She got up from the sofa, went into the bedroom, returned to the living room and emptied a Colt .38 revolver into her husband as he sat on he couch watching TV, then promptly called 911. When the police came, they asked her what happened. She replied that she simply couldn't take it anymore. He just wouldn't stop changing the channels. ...<br>  <br>  I guess it goes to show that you never really know what's going through your partner's mind.|`|q4kEXT9maa	No, when he's at my house he has total control and when Im at his house, I have total control.....and the kids have their own t.v.'s at my house and his house.|`|Hzf3QK9faa	Not so much the control of it as the use of it. Not a happy scene when I have it and I keep flipping to see all that's on as we have no tv guide here. Bothers darling a bit.|`|56bNLJykaa	No one watches much TV|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Not really.

67dWrrH9aa	Yes, anything can be true to an extent. Stereotypes are stereotypes because they are "believed" to be the majority population. It's wrong, but it CAN be accurate.|`|RpxKmUBUaa	No offense to those that are Jewish and dont fit this stereotype....but I do know this one Jewish man who is cheap as hell, wears the same clothes day in and day otu(cause he doesnt want to buy new ones), and has the HUGE nose! He works at the university I go to as a professor, and hes a weird pervert....no one likes him, but I do know many other cool Jewish people completely the oppposite of this guy!|`|AA12004569	Some of them are. They'd have to be, or else they wouldn't be stereotypes to begin with! But certainly they are not true all the time for everyone, it would be silly to assume that.|`|eZbkg3BWaa	Not every stereotype applies to every person who is a member of the group in question!<br>  <br>  ..But there is often *some* truth to them, yeah.<br>  They were made from generalizations and specific tendencies, not from complete fiction.|`|20af19563193d6f76a6c7f153bd57eb9aa	Well, obviously the stereotypes had to come from somewhere, but no of course they're not true because people are not cookie cut images of whatever group they belong to.<br>  <br>  Cartman2 is a perfect example as to why stereotyping is wrong.  When a stereotype arises, people look for these stereotypical traits in other people, and when they find it they justify it as proof of the stereotype--there are plenty of "cheap" people with big noses who are not Jewish, but because one man seems to fit a stereotype it fuels irrational bias.|`|1dAnKvHaaa	nope<br>  <br>  the past is not = to the future. (:<br>  things may happen in the past that causes people to stereotype about certain stuff, but it may not be true today and in the future|`|fvN18yvGaa	How can stereotypes be true if there not created by the ppl that there Directed at..So what you have is a misguided and unintelligent assumption that's usually degrades someone while making that person feel superior..|`|D7no6bPHaa	Maybe in a few cases, but not always. Human beings are a very diverse species and everyone is different - you can't possibly generalize tings.|`|YhuH2k4Caa	um no. because everyone is different and shouldnt be generalized over something that is not based on facts.|`|LLNDKbmKaa	Absolutely I am white and my hubby is black and we live in iowa and holy cow he can not go outside without a coat unless it is70 degrees he says all black folk hate the cold and roller coasters|`|lCHcKdbXaa	yes i do, i think its hilarious when i witness one|`|sunZH89Gaa	Oxymoron.  A stereotype will never be "true" or "false", some members of a particular group will fit into them, some don't. Stereotyping is generalizing an entire group which will always yield variables because no two people are alike, let alone an entire group.|`|s7UWLOS9aa	CERTAIN ones....

96d31f2eb78b0da781f956843c10646baa	It's a pun (sort of) on being "anally retentive".  A person described as being anally retentive tends to be very neat and tidy and can get very anxious if things are out of place.  In this example it is clear that the protagonists cannot live without their CD collection being organised in a specific way.<br>  <br>  The title of the strip is misleading in that it suggests that it concerns a sexual practice when in fact it concerns a type of psychological mindset.<br>  <br>  I hope the above now at least elicits a gentle grin...

lB7PX2Voaa	Madrid, being the capital would be my first choice. But I've been there already so I'd probably hit Barcelona instead. Madrid is a beautiful city, it's been modernized. El Museo del Prado (museum) is there. You can look, see and admire great paintings from great artists. Everywhere you go dine in Madrid, the bread is already on the table and it's hard as a rock. lol|`|ZEsOcxcoaa	Barcelona, it has the unfinished cathredal,the fountains and lights,the olympic stadium ,the nou camp,the harbour,las ramblas street entertainers,Best city in the world,i love it.|`|K0iFV73Gaa	Barcelona is more of a beach town. I would go on vacation their for spring break but Madrid beinghe capital of Spain is a greatvcoty to got I also. Ok how about both? Or if only one Barcelona. I would suggest the French riviera or Monaco as a great vacatin too. Hope this helps!|`|sWgZTZz6aa	Barcelona is beautiful. It's close to the sea and the mountains too. Nothing against Madrid but every time I've been there it rained.|`|ZNr4o1EEaa	Barcelona,the football stadium alone is worth seeing|`|b9b49c8f6966c05796d62d2e120f5cccaa	Barcelona, as it's on the sea. While there is plenty to see in Madrid, Barcelona is much more cosmopolitan and you can't fail with the Gaudi buildings, great nightlife and great seafood.|`|rAfg747daa	Barcelona cause i've never heard of madrid.

They are naturally endowed with great possibilities, which, when understood and appreciated, take them to supreme heights of strength and usefulness, and when ignored or unrecog-nized, cause them to be creatures of impulse and fluctuating desire, positively without equilibrium and blown about by every wind of doctrine.<br>  <br>  Aquarius people are remarkable spirit-ual healers. Every human being born under this sign possesses this genius, whether he is aware of it or not, and it can be brought into a beautiful and phenomenal use by a respectful and loving recognition. To learn to know opportunity and improve it, is the key to Aquarius genius.<br>  <br>  Those born under this sign are gener-ally very noble, honest, and kind-hearted, and are endowed with considerable natu-ral discrimination. They are fair readers of character, and are not easily deceived by a pitiful tale. This mental and spiritual quickness makes them very apt in any study, any trade, or profession they may take up.<br>  <br>   It is hardly too much to say that Aquarius men and women who are even partially aware of their power, can succeed in almost any work they may decide to do. <br>  <br>  As they are the most powerful from a psychological stand-point, they should endeavor fully to com-prehend their failings, which are fear, the habit of procrastination, and chronic promise-breaking proclivities. Vacilla-tion and caprice are the despoilers of the genius of this sign<br>  <br>  Their people are the only people on earth, and their friends the ones who are most entitled to attention and deference. They are very fond of titles, and of using in ordi-nary conversation the prefixes to the names of their intimates. <br>  <br>  These people usually care too much for personal appearance, and some-times  take  great   risks  to   procure  for themselves the things they desire.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Intelligent<br>  Unique<br>  Original<br>  Humanitarian<br>  Friendly<br>  Independent<br>  Intellectual<br>  Very good with technology ( computer, electronics )

Increased testosterone levels in the blood are associated with masculine behaviour, aggressiveness and increased sexual desire. Increased aggressiveness may be beneficial for athletic training, but may also lead to overt violence outside the gym or the track. There are reports of violent, criminal behaviour in individuals taking AS. Other side effects of AS are euphoria, confusion, sleeping disorders, pathological anxiety, paranoia, and hallucinations.<br>  <br>  Anabolic steroid users may become dependent on the drug, with symptoms of withdrawal after cessation of drug use. The withdrawal symptoms consist of aggressive and violent behaviour, mental depression with suicidal behaviour, mood changes, and in some cases acute psychosis. At present it is unknown which individuals are particularly at risk. It is likely that great individual differences in responsiveness may exist. Some individuals try to minimise the withdrawal affects by administration of human choriogonadotropins (hCG), in order to enhance endogenous testosterone production. However, it is unknown in how far the hCG administration is successful in ameliorating the withdrawal effects.|`|CZiUI0Y6aa	Not into macho crap like bulking up and to be honest i think its really a gay guys thing.hitting your girlfriend or any woman is just wrong.I fought Muay Thai for years done my training naturaly and i feel thats best caus it doesnt fuk with the head like steroids do.However guys hitting their girls says they are inadequate in many ways they are cowards and bullys and some are just scum anyway.Id love to get one of them in the ring and let em see wot it feels like to be gettin knocked around, see how big they are then.|`|8NRoO1Skaa	That's what you think<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hogrockcafe.com/Sporting%20Tips%2024.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hogrockcafe.com/Sporting%20Ti...</a>|`|3lrXg6heaa	I think its pretty uncool to cheat by using steroids to build up muscles, chances are if a girl found out thats what you did she wouldn't want to know you anyway.<br>  <br>  P.S because you shouted that...NO STAR FOR YOU|`|ZEsOcxcoaa	Most body builders are a bit gay ,all that preening ,posing ,looking in mirrors , etc , def  something going on .|`|ZYONnSk9aa	i agree i think it is childish and there is no need for hurting your body for lack of confidence.

5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	The same way she felt when she found out that Abby was her sister and Evil Adam was moving in to take her daddy's heart ( Boy,,that was short lived )<br>   By the look on her face the other day... you could tell she wasn't too happy... but it may have been because deep down she wants mommy & daddy back together.( what a disaster )<br>  <br>   Another Newman child means...less inheritance for the others .|`|vqUVWPBAaa	Victoria's face fall fell apart when Ashley announced that she was pregnant. Maybe because she remembers that Ashley was told that she could not have anymore children after that car accident in 2003 in which Ashley miscarried Brad's baby.<br>  Not to mention, she does not like Ashley, Ashley was always the other woman in her parents marriage. This is Ashley's fourth pregnancy and third one in which Victor is the daddy. I doubt she will carry to full term but will the writes have her go mental again like she did when after the abortion and death of baby Robert.|`|ow1m3c8jaa	Other than the fact that it seems that no one is good enough for Victor in her eyes except for Nikki, and if Ashley is pregnant than her Victor most likely won't be splitting up soon I'm not sure why she would be upset, but you could sure tell that she was by the look on her face when she heard the news.|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	I think it's a sibling rivalry thing, she probably gets it from her mom Nikki because she always wants Victor to put her children first because they are the oldest, it's like they should have seniority.<br>  <br>  Also, as far back as I can remember, Victoria has always wanted Victor & Nikki to stay together forever so she is jealous of anyone that comes between them.|`|r7sgshwKaa	I think she's probably in a state of shock. She just might be afraid to say anything after what happened with Sabrina. I know that I would be afraid of a repeat occurrence. I don't know why Victor feels the need to just hurt his immediate family the way he does. He just makes a new family and to hell with the rest of them right? Its quite sad because it seems like when he finds a new flavor of the month everybody else gets pushed to the back burner. If I were Victoria and NIck I would never have went back to work with him. Victor has issues. I would say I feel sorry for Ashley because this just seems like a disaster waiting to happen.|`|5JgchYUEaa	she is definitely not a happy camper. victoria is jealous always has been, always will be when it comes to victor and getting her daddy's attention. geez. she should really stop with the madness now. she is married and has a kid of her own. i am so tired of the mine, mine, mine act when it comes to her dad.|`|Jy9KORHDaa	She is always jealous and fighting for Daddy's attention. It is ridiculous her and Nick can be with whoever they want and everyone just has to accept it but if Victor moves past Nikki they all take it personal|`|GomZ9oYHaa	Im sure she feels like knocking her teeth down her throat. I just wish Ashley was going through the change. Geezz she's too old to be having another kid.|`|msUIsv8maa	Victria sees Victor is Favoring his other kids over her and Nick.

I'll agree that most of the stuff on the radio is crappy. I'll hear a good song from time to time, but it's rare. I love melodic things, lately music is really repetitive and lacks a catchy tune like "What A Wonderful World" or "When I Fall in Love." But there are melodic things out there other than oldies, It's just not always easy to find, and it's not always appreciated. Lyrics have also become much more shallow and the meaning and word choice is not as rich. But it kind of matches today's society--there's less and less classy, intelligent people. I think it was just a different time that's all...

GGAgxzJNaa	Here you go:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_boy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_boy</a><br>  <br>  The term "best boy" comes from the early studio days in which production crews were predominantly male. In modern productions, women serve in many of the different studio crafts. Female best boys are quite common, though they are still credited as "best boy".<br>  The term also predates the film business; in the English apprentice system, the "best boy" was the Master's oldest, most experienced apprentice and thereby given more responsibility than the others - in effect he was second person in charge, as a best boy grip or electrician is today, carrying out the Key Grip's or Gaffer's instructions.
CmcB9P4xaa	If u don't want anything bloody and gorey, then DON'T watch the Saw movies. Those r really bad like that... Im 13 and my friends say that some good ones r the Grudge movies. I love scary movies but i never have time to watch them, so I really don't know of that many. Oh, another good one is Hide and Seek or The Strangers. Im gonna go 2 the movies and see the Haunting in Conneticut.|`|e6jrBORRaa	You could watch"The Others" if you haven't seen it before.  It's rated PG-13.  It's not gory and heavy on suspense!  Plus, there is a great twist at the end.  Check it out and tell me what you think of it.  <br>  <br>  "Poltergeist" is rated PG, but it is probably a bit outdated.  I do know it scared the pants off me back in the day.  :-)  It has a good storyline, but the special effects will look like they were made back in the early 80's which is when this one came out.  If you can get past that, it's good.  It was written by Steven Spielberg and directed by Tobe Hooper, famous for the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" movies.<br>  <br>  "Sixth Sense" is another good thriller that ends with a twist.  It's rated PG-13.|`|iNzyFviGaa	Mirrors it scared the cra* outa me.

Though she has bags under her eyes, she still looks genuinely happy and content with life.

It was just silly enough to make me laugh, but not so silly that it became stupid.<br>  <br>  "Edward Scissorhands"<br>  I thought this one was just plain stupid.  I'm sorry I wasted my money to see it.  A cross between sci-fi-horror and a Chick Flick.<br>  <br>  "Mamma Mia"<br>  I'm probably one of the few guys on the planet who thinks that Abba was not that bad.  Gorgeous Greek scenery and a lot of fun.  There were a couple of cringe-worthy moments (50-something Christine Baranski flirting with a teenage boy, and Pierce Brosnan trying to sing), but they didn't ruin the movie.  There is a bit after the ending credits that is just plain FUN.<br>  .|`|J7RuBjPTaa	1) Blades Of Glory - not funny at all.

Not sure about the wisdom of making character actors sing. Firth looked terribly out of his depth and his twist at the end made me just scream WHAT?!? cause it came out of nowhere. The only song I truly enjoyed was I don't want to talk, because there is nothing on this world that can make Meryl Streep look bad, and she knocked that out of the park.|`|qEIURrnJaa	Mamma mia was good.|`|PI7v39ihaa	edward scissor-hands of course and not just cause of johnny either

8nigkuTTaa	Well. . . I'm turning 21 in a month and I'm only 5'.  I don't like it.  It makes me feel younger than everyone else, honestly.  Like I'm a Forever Child almost.    Sometimes it bothers me when they say things like my ukulele looks like a guitar, compared to my body size, but whatever.  I guess if my height's the only thing people can think to make fun of me about, good!<br>  <br>  It can be awkward when you meet someone who's freakishly tall.  Then you're eye-to-pants-fly with them and that's just awkward.<br>  <br>  A good thing about being short is it's like people are ALWAYS looking at you as if it was one of those above-head Myspace pictures that make everyone look thin and great.  As opposed to tall people, who you can see the underside of their chins, and up their noses.  It broadens their jaw line and makes them look like they have little foreheads.  So, we always have that advantage!  We look like Bratz dolls (because everyone's looking down at us, which is a great angle) and tall people look absolutely beasting and we can see their boogers.<br>  <br>  So, there's good and bad things.  Besides, 5'3" isn't so bad, and I'm sure you're not done growing.  You're still young.|`|ymrRwZr3aa	At 5' 6"+ (not quite 5' 7"), I do wish I was taller. <br>  <br>  It was a dream to be a fashion model, so I do envy those that are taller (only if they are thin as well), and even if they don't model, at least have the CHANCE to do so, simply because of their height.|`|y2t3F690aa	NO I DONT, i like fitting into small spaces! :]<br>  <br>  ((5'2 17 yrs. old))<br>  <br>  ((were not short were FUN SIZE))|`|vlxxvFe4aa	No i don't envy tall people. I believe that "Explosives Come In Small Packages......" Moreover its not your physical appearance that counts. what actually matters is your inner qualities....|`|9CNhDfnraa	Ha I'm shorter than that and I'm turning 17 in April..Actually I don't know my exact height, but I think I must be around 5'1..But nah I never do. Being short has it's perks...=P|`|HgNd8LUzaa	Nope, but I wish I was 5'6 at least =D|`|TBZK5q78aa	I envy nothing... Be happy for who you are.|`|8ae9CGqcaa	No, I certainly don't.|`|Kbj0Lhxfaa	I'm 17, a male, and 5'6. It really doesn't bother me at all. As long as you are confident with who you are it doesn't really matter how short you are. And besides how often do you see people saying "HOLY COW THAT PERSON IS SO SHORT!" besides you're still probably going to grow especially if your parents are talller then you are.|`|phVqMDrAaa	you will probably get over it. i used to hate being so small but i dont mind so much now. its not always great but it can have its advantages. my boyfriend (whom i love!) is kinda short at 5'8 and he is always telling me how much he loves my size cuz im the perfect fit for him. <br>  ive also dated a really tall guy at 6'3 which i dont remember being weird at all so it all works out!<br>  im 5'3 and 19. <br>  plus tall people usually have hunched sholders! ;)|`|ryQsiqAFaa	Sometimes i do, but most of the time i don't. <br>  I'm 5ft exactly and almost 17 years old lol.<br>  you shouldn't let it bother you too much besides if you ever needed to hide from a killer or something it would be super easy =D|`|95Xn7PkJaa	I'm not jealous of the tall ones at all.  I'm older than you are, and shorter.<br>  <br>  Height has nothing to do with who you truly are... unless you're that shallow.|`|9aQnGnxtaa	Well... my height is 5"3 and I'm taller than my mom.

(You also get to know that there are a lot of worse things in life.  I have a friend in a wheelchair who needs help to shower, dress etc so anytime I start to feel a little sorry for myself, I just remember that I can walk and run around as I please, drive, race up and down stairs without thinking about it, go into any building etc )<br>  <br>  Comfort yourself with the knowledge that while we shorties can hack a heap off the hems of clothes and have them rehemmed, the really tall people just find clothes that are too short for them! (Even if we do pay the same price for acres less fabric!)<br>  <br>  I DO get frustrated not being able to reach things on the higher shelves in supermarkets but have now got used to accosting the nearest taller person and asking them nicely if they could grab what I need from the higher shelf.  People are happy to help if you're friendly and polite.|`|eRVRWwkBaa	I'm petite :D  My brother is 6'3" which freaks everyone out. The only time i envy is when he or my cousins pick me up by my leg and hang me upside down.<br>  I'm okay with it and a lot better with it since I heard a couple girls say,'I hate girls like her they get away with everything with the guys' which i think is kinda true. Your only 13 though. You never know. Be happy with yourself; its being okay with yourself that is important.|`|ADWIWx5Baa	No i enjoy being short =)<br>  and lol...your taller than me  5'0|`|4EZis4lWaa	Woa, sis, I'm 5'2'' and 19 years old.  Being 5'1 - 5'3 just means we are "petite" and isn't a bad thing.  There are times I wish I was taller, but I don't envy tall people.  I just think people would listen more when I talked if I was, say, 5'7.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	I'm right at average height for a man (a little under 5'10"), so I guess I can answer this.  I wouldn't say I envy them, but if I could change my height I'd definitely add some inches, maybe up to about 6'2" or 6'3".|`|AA11198190	Good heavens above.Be thankful that you have a life...<br>  Don't go crying.There are a lot of people out there with REAL disabilities......<br>  They would trade places with you any day.|`|ZbZnIcoIaa	I like my size :)

Usually I am, but if people take advantage of that then I don't forgive, I rebell.|`|7dedb1d505bc774b219a42c84ed2ca4caa	Yeah, I use to have friends that only make use of me, they only talk to me when they need to go somewhere and needed some transport (i had a car since back then)<br>  <br>  Of course I wasn't really fond of the idea of being used, but now, I don't hate them or anything for that. I still talk to them.

H08vPJ2Maa	I agree with you. I feel so sorry for her and if I could wave a magic wand and make her better, I would do. However, I loathe and despise her. The only reason she became famous was for being thick. Not a good message to give out.<br>  <br>  My step-mother is dying of cancer, yet where is her fanfare? Did Harrods give her anything? Where is Elton John to host her party? She has done so much for others and always puts others first - she is a million times the person Jade Goody is.|`|levE5VCpaa	I think a lot of people think the same way as you, it's just shocking to see someone dying so publicly, and it's a mixture of horror at whats happening to her and sympathy for her and her family.|`|3LEPfzVhaa	I didn't like her, and I still don't, but I am sympathetic, as having cancer is an awful thing, and she will leave two very young boys behind.|`|G8zAPz8Maa	Which Jade Goody are you talking about now - the fat, stupid, racist self publicist or is there another one who actually DESERVES our sympathy ?|`|eUFsTmlsaa	Because they feel bad for her and they don't want her to die|`|433165e2c7b432dcd07898d64f6f19c8aa	I never disliked her in the first place so i don't like her any more now than i always did. I actually always admired her for her ability to make money despite her lack of education, and i admire her now because of her incredible bravery and selflessness. Despite the nasty comments i've heard about her, she's always been a wonderful mother who adores her children. She made a fortune doing what she does best after all. Lack of education isn't a crime. She said some horrible things, but it wasn't racist, it was merely ineducation. I admire her actually for putting her children first and sticking up two fingers to those that slag her off.. She'd be slagged off if she didn't secure her children's future after her death, so she'll never please everyone. You and i aren't famous, which is why we would never get that same level of treatment. Jade is, so she does. Simple really. And for all the money she has, it wont save her life, so she is just like anyone else. She simply has a little more money than most.|`|dZ78IohLaa	I do see what you mean, but if you know Jades story she had a really tough upbringing and has made good with her life. You cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear and she will never be refined and properly educated - not her fault. She is now making sure that her sons will be by providing the money for private education of the best kind. Fair play to her they will have the chances in life she never had. She should be admired for this. She may be a rough diamond but she has a heart of gold and has been a fantastic mother - her sons will inherit what she has worked hard for and will make her proud one day.<br>  Just to confirm I cannot say I like her but I admire what she has done for her boys.|`|xDSScmkDaa	I completely agree with you, my mum had skin cancer and was put on a waiting list, i despise the fact 'famous' people receive more help and faster. I thought the same of Anna Nicole, with all the dieing people around the world why dont they recieve any attention??|`|BK0Obg8Saa	I think you are missing the point a little what people like and admire is the love she so obviously has for her children.She is trying to leave them a financial security and doing it the only way she knows.Compared with the way some parents abuse their children she's a saint.|`|RSG4KVHOaa	Stuff like this just happens. When someone's dead or dying they suddenly become the most admirable person in the world.<br>  I think people mainly like Jade Goody because they can see how brave she's being about it all, and most people can't imagine being able to cope so well under the same circumstances.|`|skwfCkokaa	i agree with you kinda, she is dying and everyone so upset about it, what happened to the people who hated her on big brother, all those millions of people.|`|6AZ4ZV3jaa	maybe because everyone feels sorry for her i dont like her still but i just think its shocking she has cancer and that|`|7c78402fd1142e6ed4496774eb33431baa	I hated her before, and I still hate her now. On the other hand, she IS raising money for her 2 boys. But anyone else who has cancer still suffers the same, just without the PR etc. Why does PR make Jade Goody a desperado on the whole situation? I'm not saying that cancer is good for her etc, but she could have done what richard hammond did - let fans give money to cancer trusts instead of her.|`|81bc5e1b7f28b60b366a49c329f3158caa	"Everyone" is too broad.<br>  <br>  I don't like her and have never liked her. However, like you, I don't think she deserves cancer. But then, who does? <br>  <br>  However she has been entertaining (plenty of people out there like her and some even like to dislike or even 'hate' her.) <br>  <br>  Queue jumping is one of the benefits of being a celebrity. Shouldn't be that way but it is. <br>  <br>  Anyway it seems that she is repentant now and I hope that she finally finds peace. My heart goes out to her two young children - it's a terrible thing for a child to lose their mother at such a young age.|`|ftIUXfK7aa	I've never really liked or disliked her - I've always felt sorry for her terrible childhood. I also have to disagree - she's not racist - when she abused Shilpa Shetty is was through pure ignorance not racism. <br>  <br>  You have to give it to the girl - she is ill-educated but has made a bucketload of money, it could have been very different for her if she had sat on her **** and done nothing. <br>  <br>  So I think I'm trying to say, I probably wouldn't choose her as my best buddy, but she is a young girl with 2 little children who is dying. My heart goes out to her and her family - cancer is an awful disease, and I feel sorrow when I think of her.|`|hoGpOrOUaa	I COMPLETLY agree with you and have been asking people the same question.<br>  All in all, Jade Goody is not a nice person. Neither is her boyfriend. <br>  The crimes he has commited (Assult and threatening people) Is disgusting and I hate that he is getting spechial treatment too!<br>  <br>  I think its fair enough that Jade is trying to raise enough money for her boys by doing what she does best - Exposing her whole entire life on cameras - But i think it would be noble of her to donate some money to Cancer research.<br>  Of course, that is her own choice but I think she should...|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Well, it's the media's way.  Before Princess Di got killed, the papers were calling her an upper class slag, when she dies then suddenly they're saying that we all loved her and always did, princess of hearts, etc.  It's basically the same in this case..|`|TCqrS8Vqaa	hiya, im sorry but i have always like her.she is a true down to earth working class girl.|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	They may not have thought much of her as she was talentless. People put themselves into her place and can see what an awful thing it is to know that any day now you will die. Most of us know that it will happen one day but we do not know what day that will be.  We empathise and sympathise with her.|`|2XC3E2dYaa	they don't necessarily like her they just feel sorry for her you have to be very cold hearted to be happy she's dieing|`|ZvhtPCWQaa	sympathy<br>  <br>  and just because it's the internet, it doesn't mean that you have to be rude to everyone.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	It's not a question of suddenly liking her. She is still an ill-educated and loud young woman, but the media has allowed us to see a more balanced portrayal of her since she became ill. I've seen a different side to her. The fact that she has tried so hard to earn money to leave to her boys, even when she is in pain, is really commendable. The fact that she wanted to be baptised and have her boys baptised too was very touching. Whatever she may or may not have done, she is extremely ill and I deplore some of the questions, answers, comments and so-called jokes which I've read on here.

ZefydJ8Gaa	its just some math trick<br>  <br>  edit: ok nvm i have no idea<br>  <br>  edit: ok now i do i googled it<br>  The game asks you to select any two digit number (example 25).  Next, you are to subtract the both the first and second digits from your number (example: 25 – 2 – 5 = 18).  Then you are to select a gift from a grid of all possible answers.  In the final page, Regifting Robin correctly guesses your gift.  So how does this nifty trick work?<br>  <br>  The equation can be represented as:  (10*x + y) - x - y = 9*x<br>  <br>  Using our example, x = 2 and y = 5, so that’s (10*2 + 5) – 2 – 5 = 9*2 = 18.<br>  <br>  In the gift grid, each 9*x box has the same gift, e.g., the boxes numbered 9, 18, 27, 36, etc. all are marked “Bath Salts.”<br>  <br>  The selected gift is changed each time to make the trick seem more real.|`|w0EgyiJCaa	Yeah I got it.|`|qxqrZuobaa	You pick a two digit number<br>  Then, you subtract the first digit from the second digit.<br>  Then you remember the number and see what the regift is<br>  And the lady guesses what it is.<br>  She guessed mine wrong.|`|fbd41793724db36b70eff30aebe40d0caa	She got mine wrong.

4tD32D9qaa	Contrary to popular belief, most of the time it's because it's an actual audience. People usually think it's a laugh track as these people seem to have an overactive sense of humour, they laugh at everything! It's because they're encouraged to do so. Sometimes they will insert a generic laugh track though, this is commonly done not to insult but because we've become so used to having people laughing it the background that it's strange when there's no laughing. Yes people do consider it insulting but we have to put up with it, when it's an audience it's a good source of income for the programme and allows people to see the programme live. When it's generic it's simply done so that the programme contains the same sort of auora it had when it was first made, many programmes are done with live audiences in their first series for funding purposes and a generic laugh track may be inserted in a later series so that we feel comfortable with it, so that the programme doesn't feel different.|`|DOAIzWfjaa	yea they should... i do not think that its funny..<br>  your trying to watch the show and BAUM theres the laugh<br>  UGHHHHHH I hate that|`|OLPgKWFNaa	cause their jokes are usually so lame and pathetic. :D|`|V1XNY519aa	i totally agree. i think they are F&%$ing annoying!|`|eNl8GhPUaa	how else would we know when we're supposed to laugh? and it usually isn't funny.|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	GOD YES - I hate that.

Each chore had an amount attached to it from $0.50 to $1.50 - they could choose what chore and how many chores they wanted to do each week and that way they could choose how much money they wanted to earn per week. The only rule was that they had to show me when they had completed the chore so that I could keep a total and every Friday I would pay them. <br>  <br>  Some chores changed per season (rake, shovel etc...) but some stayed the same (dishes, trash, laundry).<br>  <br>  Also - If I saw them doing something extra throughout the week (helping someone with groceries at the store, holding doors, etc...) I would occassionally add some extra and tell them the extra was for the good deeds I noticed they had done.

NEVER AGAIN|`|Jp5sAxwnaa	Sometimes, but the problem is always taken care of as soon as it can be. What I do (for bottom teeth anyway) is strange enough that I don't do it in public, it it always helps me, I let my mouth hang open and saliva pool into my mouth, only skimming off a little bit now and then once my mouth is full so that I don't drool on myself.|`|bxH8zngPaa	Well if you have a really bad toothache, it may be a cavity that got bigger and now your root is exposed to what you eat.  This would require a root canal to get rid of the pain.  Good luck!

K6OCd0r9aa	he is of hindu descent and he was raised/lives in England|`|iuwLHT2Taa	Devesh (Dev) Patel (Gujarati: ??? ????[1] born 23 April 1990) is a British film and television actor as well as a martial artist.<br>  <br>  Dev (Devesh) Patel was born in Brent, Greater London, England, to Hindu Gujarati Indian parents, both of whom were born in Nairobi, Kenya. His mother Anita Patel is a carer and his father Raj Patel an IT consultant. Dev Patel, who grew up in Harrow, attended Longfield Primary School and later went to Whitmore High School, receiving an A* in GCSE Drama, for his "self-penned portrayal of a child in the Beslan school siege". His drama teacher Niamh Wright has stated: "Dev was a gifted student who quickly impressed me with his innate ability to communicate a wide variety of characters imaginatively and creatively. He was awarded full marks for his GCSE performance to a live audience and the visiting examiner was moved to tears by his honest portrayal of a child in the Beslan school hostage crisis in Russia. He eventually completed his AS Levels in 2007, while he was working in Skins.

It was too much to read?  Get some Riddlen and settle down.  I read the whole thing.  <br>  <br>  Any way, on to the answer.  Next time you're at the shop and your little funk monkeys start following you around and talking smack, tell the shop keep.  If the shop owner won't do anything call the cops.  No one should have to put up with this kind of harassment.  You should not feel uneasy going to buy some clothes.  You have every right to be there.  And if the shop keep was any kind of intelligent person he would call the cops on his own, because how good is it for business to have some hormone tripping freaks stalking the clientele?  That's my advice.  Just don't let these window lickers make you afraid.

TXJLUEG7aa	I LOVE Paramore! I'm a guy, and I don't usually like girl singers because none of them are really rockin'. I love Hayley Williams. My favorite songs are Crushcrushcrush, Decode, That's What You Get, and Misery Business.<br>  <br>  Now to answer your question: no, you are not "emo" for listening to Paramore. They don't even play emo. If you were listening to PANIC! At The Disco or Fall Out Boy, I would think differently.<br>  <br>  After all, the word "emo" is always misused, and it's being misused now. Emo is a state of depression. If you dress "emo", it's not called emo. It's called goth. You are not emo just because you listen to Paramore.|`|knduADFXaa	Paramore isnt an emo band.<br>  lol<br>  <br>  and you forgot:<br>  miracle<br>  we are broken<br>  Fences<br>  born for this<br>  pressure<br>  whoa<br>  circle<br>  breath<br>  breathe (until tomorrow)<br>  conspiracy<br>  Decoy<br>  Here we go again<br>  just like me<br>  My heart<br>  my number one<br>  Oh star<br>  Stuck on you<br>  temporary<br>  Adore<br>  <br>  <br>  theres more.<br>  im just too lazy to type the rest out :P|`|abgoV6fqaa	Ok, people can't be emo.<br>  Emo is a genre of music categorized by clashing guitar riffs, intricate drum tracks, and high-pitched vocals.<br>  <br>  As for Paramore, they have bits of it in there but not a lot.<br>  Fall Out Boy is definitely emo but that doesn't make them suck. In fact, From Under The Cork Tree is one of my favorite albums.|`|4AuzOjVEaa	hu cares?<br>  u've got most of em and btw my fave bands include paramore fall out boy and p@ the disco and they are defo nt emo!

DhExpMlnaa	I think that the issue should be left alone, not because people get offended, but because people get obese by themselves. If they really wanted to lose weight they would try to either work it off or get surgery. Also, just because everyone else in ******* America is getting fat doesn't mean that they should cut the trans fat and all the other things that make food taste good out. If people don't want to get fat, they won't eat the food. It's not my fault Shirley weighs 300 pounds because she ate too much cake in her lifetime. This is a complex issue and it's a little hard to explain my views.<br>  But yeah, I think fat people should be left alone because it's their fault they're fat.

Y1aAGPURaa	That was cute!!   Did you hear why the chicken crossed the road?  Here are some interesting answers:<br>  <br>  BARACK OBAMA: The chicken crossed the road because it was time for a change! The chicken wanted change!<br>  <br>  JOHN McCAIN: My friends, that chicken crossed the road because he recognized the need to engage in cooperation and dialogue with all the chickens on the other side of the road.<br>  <br>  HILLARY CLINTON: When I was First Lady, I personally helped that little chicken to cross the road. This experience makes me uniquely qualified to ensure right from Day One that every chicken in this country gets the chance it deserves to cross the road. But then, this really isn't about me.<br>  <br>  GEORGE W. BUSH: We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road, or not. The chicken is either against us, or for us. There is no middle ground here.<br>  <br>  DICK CHENEY: Where's my gun?<br>  <br>  COLIN POWELL: Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road.<br>  <br>  BILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with that chicken. What is your definition of chicken?<br>  <br>  AL GORE: I invented the chicken.<br>  <br>  JOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken's intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it.<br>  <br>  AL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white? We need some black chickens.<br>  <br>  DR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won't realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he's acting by not taking on his current problems before adding new problems.<br>  <br>  OPRAH: Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross this road so bad. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I'm going to give this chicken a car so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.<br>  <br>  ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road.<br>  <br>  NANCY GRACE: That chicken crossed the road because he's guilty! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks.<br>  <br>  PAT BUCHANAN: To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.<br>  <br>  MARTHA STEWART: No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer's Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information.<br>  <br>  DR SEUSS: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I've not been told.<br>  <br>  ERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die in the rain, alone.<br>  <br>  JERRY FALWELL: Because the chicken was gay! Can't you people see the plain truth? That's why they call it the other side. Yes, my friends, that chicken is gay. And if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like the other side. That chicken should not be crossing the road. It's as plain and as simple as that.<br>  <br>  GRANDPA: In my day we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough.<br>  <br>  BARBARA WALTERS: Isn't that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its lifelong dream of crossing the road.<br>  <br>  ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.<br>  <br>  JOHN LENNON: Imagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together, in peace.<br>  <br>  BILL GATES: I have just released eChicken2008, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook. Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken2008. This new platform is much more stable and will never crash.<br>  <br>  ALBERT EINSTEIN: Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken?<br>  <br>  COLONEL SANDERS: Did I miss one? Damn.|`|uzXwM0Qzaa	He was racing with the chicken!|`|5voFMvonaa	poor dumb tortoise,he would make a nice tortilla now.|`|gZQN3c7naa	oh!!! that was really interesting!!|`|2bfde9659efa5b0ae5d12aab6a92051eaa	Hmmmm.....not that funny. sorry.

776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	They used to only have music-related programming (mostly music videos) until about the mid-90's when they changed their format due to the success of that stupid Real World show.  They figured out that shows like that really appeal to the teenage crowd and that's where the money is.  So they pretty much abandoned the whole music thing when they introduced MTV2, which was supposed to be all music, like the old MTV.  But now MTV2 plays the same stupid crap because, again, that's apparently where the money is.  You pretty much have to watch music videos online now.|`|flU2gf54aa	MTV quit being about music years ago.

They have boys wearing girls clothes, girls being sexually active before they're eligible for Girl Scouts and an entire ethnicity reinforcing negative stereotypes all to make the mighty dollar.|`|FIWB7Dgtaa	back in the day mtv was pretty badass and they were all about the music. then sadly they branched out and the music became obsolete and we had to rely on crappy trl which then turned even crappier when they stopped playing the whole video and just gave a snippet with fans yelling how they love their bff!! dont get me started on mtv.|`|niq3ETl0aa	Those reality shows really trap kids. My daughter who is 15 watches T.I.s Road to Redemption, the anger one, bad girls, she used to watch the girls next door. I've been actually thinking of limiting her MTV time now. It's hard for us older people cuz I remember when Martha Quinn was the first and only VJ.  Now, I have to ask my kids, when do they show the videos? TRL, but the videos are interrupted by young people jumping around in swimsuits on the beach? What the hell? Maybe VH1 is the place to go|`|ca841cf933a1cfe35feefdca680d9edcaa	I was thinking about this today!! I think they should change it to RTV- Reality TV or something like that.<br>  <br>  It used to be all music... but maybe they get more viewers on their TV Shows rather than their music videos? That's the only reason I can think of.|`|kDz9gcMuaa	The MTV and MTV one are programmes but 4 programmes after are Music programmes.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I agree, It use to play videos all the time, Now it sucks.|`|2hpa04xeaa	Because they get paid millions, if not billions, to run their unoriginal TV-shows and advertisements, and only then, for a few minutes, do we get to see actual music videos, before it goes back to yet another reality TV show.|`|b2279e5cc69cc91364de96b34bf0caaaaa	Sadly, it use to play music videos almost constantly when it first started in the early 80s.

ded7fc19860a81607ee52a6560480ab2aa	you made it too tight, you have to tune the top string E lower, tune your guitar to the key of C, you should have no trouble with that. tuning a guitar takes a little practice,|`|0d1962ce76e34fe5748f85b8939585edaa	The string might have been too tight but remember when something is manufactured, there will always be instances of materials failure. It may just be that you ended up with the dodgy one. The price of a guitar string is too small to be worth the hassle of having it replaced. If you still are not happy, take the guitar to a music shop and have them string it and tune it. That way if the string goes again you may have some comeback.

rNxK7cY8aa	Actually the Bounto arc is basically useless and you don't need to watch it at all. As the first answerer said none of it appears in the manga. And while the bounts don't actually show up till episode 70 (or around there) the filler arc does start around episode 59-60. Its just them introducing the three new mod souls, Ririn, Nova, and Cloudo. (which also don't appear in the manga.) The next episode that actually gets back to the manga is episode 110, after they defeat the bounts.<br>  <br>  The newest episode out right now is 209 in english sub. But if your talking about dubs, the latest episode I know of is 109.<br>  >.><br>  The english version is really far behind.|`|7Sflq2doaa	The Bount arc is filler so the manga can get further ahead of the anime, It starts @ 64 and ends @ 109 then returns to the manga storyline. There is another filler arc from 168 to 189 but that won't be in English for a while. On adult swim it is still in the bount arc @ 104|`|NNxLypgaaa	Bounts aren't in the manga, and they are still in Hueco Mungo (however you spell it). The anime got tired of waiting for the manga, so they have totally diverged.
u9RwzLPnaa	I don't think he wrote Planet Terror. I could be wrong about that. Planet Terror has a lot of zombies. Blowing stuff up and what not. I found it to be redundant but it was shown as a double feature with Death Proof so why not.<br>  <br>  Yes, you should|`|V1hxvQukaa	yeah. planet terror is good, but then again, i liked death proof too. <br>  <br>  planet terror is definitely the... "more out there" movie of the two. lol<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  just so you know, the two Grindhouse movies were written and directed by two different directors. Death Proof was by Tarantino and Planet Terror was by Robert Rodriguez.|`|VVgYWIl0aa	Yeah!! I know Death Proof had like a million dead moments and the movie didn't get exciting till someone was being chased or dying which was about 5 minutes of the whole film LOL! But Planet terror is sooooo much better I loved it. It actually was together with Deathproof. When the movies first came out it was called Grindhouse (you might remember). Death proof has some of the same actors and also some of the same characters as Planet Terror... Planet Terror lot's more blood and action non stop this movie is a must see... please watch it!! LOL!|`|qBuJbWBzaa	well planet terror has some more gruesome violence and action sequences unlike death proof which had lot of yapping. i watched both the movies and i liked planet terror better.

bMQ9QPXkaa	Funimation only recently released Season Eight of the "Ultimate Uncut Special Edition" dub of Dragon Ball Z. Until someone rips it from the DVDs and posts it on the internet you'll have to wait unless you want to buy them yourself. I know that Future Shop and Best Buy have but Ebay or Craigslist might have it cheaper. Here's the offical site link for buying it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rightstuf.com/1-800-338-6827/catalogmgr/Q5XLnMM3dXtVUePJoR/browse/item/82278/4/0/0" rel="nofollow">http://www.rightstuf.com/1-800-338-6827/...</a><br>  <br>  If I were you I'd probably first try Blockbuster or another video rental store first. Even if you do manage to get your hands on it it's only episodes 220 - 253. The best choice would be to wait till some one rips the DVDs or rent it. Season Nine has yet to be released or announced. I really hope this helped.

GO0FqfOIaa	It kind of does but doesn't. :]<br>  what i think she ment to say is something along the lines of, your first impression of me will probably be a b!tch. But i am a really sweet girl, when you get to know me. But sometimes, i can become a b!tch, if im angry.<br>  Did that make sense? lmoa.<br>  i don't think it does, that's confusing! lmao. :]|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	It makes good sense to me...she's saying that she probably doesn't put up with a lot of crap because she's vocal about what she wants.  And, even though she may be vocal about her desires or dislikes, she's probably a really nice girl.|`|LIjpht1Jaa	he/she meant that when people are around them they judge her and identify her as a b**ch and she admits sometimes she has a really bad attitude, but most of the time she's actually really nice and sincere. glad i could help.<br>  <3|`|63BzEtMVaa	It makes perfect sense to me. She sometimes seems to be a ***** , when she really is a nice and friendly person. She can be a ***** from time to time though.|`|vryw9udtaa	well, nobody's perfect all the time. and most people are slightly bltchy sometimes. maybe once you get to know them, they are sweet. or something. sorry, i tried!|`|riMj9CWjaa	no it doesnt make sense!<br>  <br>  it's like someone saying "i'm mean, but i'm actually nice".  how does that make sense??<br>  <br>  =]|`|roHzJUMYaa	No. If ur a ***** ur a *****. But Ivan never be anything else aswel!|`|CZ8szX0jaa	makes sense to me.|`|ylzLVdOGaa	it makes sense. although sometimes she's percieved as a b1tch and sometimes she is one most of the time she's friendly and sweet ( or at least wants to). that's my take on it.|`|AA10148408	sounds like a sociopath.  in the psychology field, we call it mood incongruent with affect.  just like if you have a loving heart, you cannot be cruel.  well vice versa too.  sounds like a nut or confused person, run!|`|dYCZkeZHaa	Sorta. I think they mean that although they may be pretty blunt/brutally honest, they're not trying to be and they're really friendly; they just speak their mind.|`|FMpPWqnHaa	i didnt understand the sentence but ya it makes sense|`|Tu2cSBAqaa	It makes sense|`|vmlArXqAaa	i makes me want to slap whoever wrote that. it sounds like an excuse to me.|`|YBtqHXaSaa	sounds like a typical woman|`|FCeu5eqgaa	yes (:<br>  she is saying she can be a b*tch if she is mad ; haha .|`|MviD8Oy4aa	haha. not so much.|`|wIOf22wRaa	Yes it makes sense.

And sometimes she really is a b*tch. But all and all she is very friendly and sweet.|`|gnV4nzPzaa	It makes sense, the person is saying that sometimes she's a b*tch (as in acts like a snob), but usually she's nice and friendly. her attitude changes or something.|`|AA11431665	It Makes Sence To Me
Gt0w2cUfaa	it's about this girl named Tracey and she's a little good girl all about school and stuff... and she wants to be friends witht the popular girl named Evie (btw if you've seen Twilight... Evie is played by Nikki Reed who plays Rosalie in Twilight) but she starts to be friends with Tracey and starts to get her into drugs, sex, piercings, etc.. so her and Tracey are both addicted to drugs and then Evie changes the board... but you wouldn't want me to spoil the ending :)<br>  but yes it is appropriate.. it's a movie every girl should watch for a lesson to learn.|`|v9vrH4Exaa	Sure.<br>  Here's a summary from IMDb:<br>  Tracy Freeland is a thirteen-year-old girl who just wants to fit in. To do so she must make friends with the most popular girl in the 7th grade ... Evie Zamora. It's not as easy as it sounds when Evie peer pressures Tracy into doing things such as stealing, drugs, piercings, and sex-- far from the Tracy everybody seems to know. But as Evie and Tracy's friendship gets closer, Tracy's old self drifts farther and farther away from her family and neighborhood friends where it's up to her mother to finally step in.<br>  <br>  I remember watching it when I was about your age.<br>  It's really good.<br>  I'm sure you'll like it; give it a try!<br>  I don't think you'll be disappointed.|`|bUoJPc9Waa	it is a very good movie, totally opens up your eyes to what can happen to young kids who get into drugs and sex waayyy to early in their lives. it is really well acted, honest, and just great, its one of my all time favorites.|`|ThKKB4dGaa	Well I havent seen it either but  I thought it looked good.<br>  Go watch the trailer it gives you the plot and stuff(:|`|YCDS4Am8aa	yea its a very good movie about a 13 year old who wants to fit in and does many stupid things.. i think its appropriate for them to watch because it will show that you should not fall to peer pressure i dont know if their parents will be too happy though
J8SC4xARaa	Not '80s! Anything from the '60s or before. That's when movies were movies, and movie stars were movie stars. :)|`|PS0oSoXFaa	Well you'd have to adjust for inflation obviously... But I think I'd go with those massive religious and historical epics from the 50's. (Which I don't much like by the way) :) The amount of work and effort they put into those was insane!!<br>  <br>  Actually the greatest flop in film history is a perfect example. It wasn't the 50's, but it was 1963 and it was in the same style. (And the last of it's kind, with good reason.) Cleopatra with Liz Taylor wasn't a "failure" at the box office, but it wasn't much of a success and given the insane amounts of money, time, and trouble that went into it, it was a disaster. I remember it almost singlehandedly bankrupted 20th Century Fox<br>  <br>  I would think anything made before the days of computers (or before the days of computers being useful, which they weren't until the 90's) was probably more expensive than today. May be wrong, though!

I haven't eaten meat since then, and I really don't miss it aside from feeling left out when other people are eating. I no longer feel that being vegetarian is ethically the right thing to do -- there are so many worse evils in the world. I think I've just conditioned myself to see meat as just a butchered dead body rather than something I might eat.<br>  <br>  I've met 2 or 3 people in a similar situation to me.

w2Dui70Faa	I really couldn't understand why Disney decided to remake a classic. The first time I've seen the trailer of the Race to Witch Mountain, I just couldn't believe The Rock is in it. It's just not right. I don't plan to watch the movie. I was also not happy with the trailer of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. They made it look like a cheap comedy movie with just a little feel of "Harry Potter-ish", if you get what I mean.|`|yqe0I5zpaa	I agree, Race To Witch Mountain is just laughably bad. Everytime they show The Rock, his acting in the movie is terrible, and that's in just three minutes! Imagine how bad the film will be with him in it.<br>  When he says "don't get in the fridge blah blah" (dont know the name)<br>  <br>  it really outlines his talent as an actor, go home, your not an actor.|`|yfwY8XGlaa	star trek.

212FfV3faa	just sue the teacher.|`|3buQDaRDaa	Go to the principal or the dean of students and complain.|`|AA11431665	Wow <br>  <br>  I Would Complain Or I Would Talk Back To Her To Make Her Life A Living Hell :D|`|gUPUSTEuaa	I think you should talk to one of the principles or another teacher before you guy's do anything else that can cause you more trouble like getting suspended or kick out of school think before you act sometimes we do stupid stuff when we are mad and regret it later. What about your parent's talk to them.|`|a3743b9bd49a3ea465b20c9f50e3b0a3aa	Seriously, go to the dean or your counselor and complain. That's just not right. I thought my chorus teacher was a *****, but that just sucks. So yeah, go complain. =]|`|19nQDjEmaa	Talk to your teacher about the problem! Sometimes they have issues going on with their lives also!|`|5oBYGB5Vaa	My 1st thought was to speak w/ your teacher about the issue. However, it seems that you've already done that. I this teacher has a history of treating you (& others) this way, It's time to go to her superior. If you're not the only one, take others w/ you who have been treated the same way -- or get their signatures on a petition. ~;/>|`|qzs4Otnsaa	Yep. Quit. She doesn't even deserve a paycheck!<br>  Which reminds me, you should tell the principal, or something. (like that) Getting teachers in trouble is fun >xD<br>  <br>  Edit: or if you love chorus and the principal doesn't care, gather your classmates for a pention and yea....|`|aiKCxCyWaa	go to the principal and tell him/her with all the others (theyre witnesses and got in trouble too). thats ridiculous. tell ur parents to come too, that always works (trust me). dont serve that detention and just go and complain. ur teacher is crazy|`|1JywgkyMaa	i used to have a ***** of a kindergarten teacher,and one day,by total accident,i got revenge by throwing up on her,later that day my older sisters were high-fiving me for it|`|CZNlP3zXaa	yea... tell the dean or principal... if you really dont have a passion for chorus then quit... make her look like a fool if shes the one being a B i t-c-  h|`|HA8bxrLTaa	Look, sometimes we have bad days, too...you don't know what's going on in our lives that may be stressing us out beyond the breaking point, where work is our only escape. And if the students are making our lives hell there, too...well, lashing out is to be expected sometimes. Teachers are only human, too. Maybe you should try to make an appt with her and say respectfully and politely "Can I just talk to you about something? I'm not gonna whine or complain or try to weasel my way out of detention, I just wanna talk to you about something."  Trust me, it'll go over way better than "OH COME ON! I WASN'T TALKING!!!"|`|raXQDWaraa	It's ok because you talked even you are doing it the mean way but it is the right way to not talk to the girl and point to your mouth like your saying be quiet but don't say it. You can do both but you can do 1 of the options but just don't be mad at the teacher and don't tell anyone and if you want you can say sorry to the teacher or the girl or both. You just do detention and don't worry about it and you can do something else. Make the best of detention.  Good Luck and I hope this helps.

f5821d0eb9486d7586aa71ba68cdecc8aa	I asked this same question a couple months ago.  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtD2Jm7aIF2Nynkmz91718Xty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081214210819AAx9aTP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>  It basically boils down that people know it's illegal and don't care.  They're too cheap to pay to see movies or say they can't afford it.<br>  <br>  I don't like paying $9.50 to watch a movie either, but I'm not going to cheat someone else out of their living.  I'm not talking about the actors, I'm talking about the other 500 people listed in the credits who are just trying to pay their bills.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	They don't know the meaning of the word "patience".  I've seen kids asking where they can download movies that haven't even been released yet!  That's just ridiculous.  If $9.50 is too much for them, they can wait until it comes out on DVD and rent it, or watch it for free when it's broadcast on TV.  Either would be much better quality than someone's illegal bootlegged video in a little window on a computer monitor, and either way it's still paying the crew by royalties or by advertising.|`|6oWIKqS7aa	i was wondering too.<br>  illegal, yes. i agree sir

wSeOxs7Jaa	They are all really good movies. My personal ranking would be:<br>  1 City of God<br>  2 Being John Malkovich<br>  3 Wizard of Oz<br>  4 The Pianist|`|XpDt1bqHaa	I thought Being John Malkovich was incredible and very funny but I have a strange sense of humor. City of God is brilliant and better but also depressing. The Wizard of OZ is of course a Classic and you could play Dark Side of the Moon to it. Heard the Pianist was good but I fell asleep.|`|5e0c2b6e245998c415bb4509ecae5500aa	zombie strippers|`|AlrCZJ3saa	The Pianist|`|yzfvzS1maa	The Pianist is a great film, Being John Malkovich I haven't seen though I think it must be a good one too|`|5kLH68pPaa	City Of God. People need to see that movie. The Pianist is a great movie too, but City Of God wins it for me.<br>  <br>  Catch The Chicken!|`|wlNGP0Bvaa	The Pianist|`|yIEKggOyaa	i think wizard of oz|`|WoCXEcsVaa	wizard of oz<br>  <br>  its a classic|`|KlkUj6uFaa	Those seem like ok choices....<br>  <br>  Some movies to avoid: Gran Torino and The Dark Knight. Extremely poor acting in both movies, truly terrible.
irSBrZiQaa	I have been watching Guiding Light for about 13 years and I have to admit the way they film it is pretty bad. I actually like some of the music that they play along with the story lines, but I do agree there are some that are not needed. They switched to hand held camera's in February of last year and to be honest it took me a long time to adjust. I would get dizzy whenever I watched. They also started spending more time outside as opposed to using studio sets. I did some research on the new filming style and here are a few things that I have read. Apparently the producer thought that switching to these new camera techniques would make for a more realistic experience. The producer also said "that she is trying to raise the ratings." in my opinion she has only hurt the ratings, a lot of people stopped watching due to the way that they are filming. The producer also said " They would like to introduce this style so that other soaps could use it in there shows." In my opinion I think it had a lot to do with budget cuts. I think this producer has managed to take the longest running soap in daytime history and run it into the ground. Guiding Light has such a rich history and I really feel bad for the Actors/Actresses that have made this show great. The Actors/Actresses are the reason I continue to watch. I am really hoping that the producer rethinks her moves and turns this show back around. By bringing Grant Aleksander(Phillip) back I think that will start to bring fans back, but this needs to continue. They need to get back a few of the core characters back as well. Harley being one of them. <br>  <br>  I will continue to watch the show and be a loyal fan because I have pretty much grown up with some of the characters. Guiding Light does have some really talented Actors/Actresses. No worries your eyes and ears are working as they should lol....|`|LO3BMobRaa	I believe the story got ruin when Roger Thorpe (Michael Zaslow) died, and Reva and Josh broke up because that's when it died off hard.|`|2kpr2arRaa	the directors don' t have as much power in tv shows as the Head producer does<br>   the Head Producer makes the main decisions about storylines/direction/casting/ and the general content of the show<br>  <br>  I had high hopes when Ellen wheeler took over as she has been an actress on soaps and knew the genre but to me she has made a mess of GL. I have only been watching lately because the return of Edmund ( and phillip to a lesser degree)- I quit watching the show more or less about a yr or so ago after being a fan for over 12 yrs.<br>  When Edmund's time is out I think I will "turn off the Light " again.<br>  <br>    While GL still has some very good actors the storylines and production values are still below par.<br>   ( well ok the handheld camera work is getting better but still it looks cheap)|`|ded7fc19860a81607ee52a6560480ab2aa	everything has changed for the worse|`|pI5EAAUcaa	I've been watching Guiding Light since 1980. At first when they made the change last year it was really shaky at times, not focused well, but it got better. <br>  They did try to save money though that is a big factor. All the offices were converted into sets. <br>  I think they're doing a great job. I feel sorry for the actors though with all that outdoor winter filming they do. They look so cold sometimes! But overall, I'm happy with the change. <br>  I have heard rumors that the show may be canceled this year. I hope not. I've been a loyal fan for so long to see it all end now.

And way back then there was no such thing as any kind of sugarfree stuff that was edible.

From how they took care of me, to the values they instilled in me. We were never rich, but what they had they gave with love.|`|XssPCV5laa	I can't say I was, no. But everyone makes mistakes. I can't deny my parents tried their best - they had their own problems to deal with that got in the way of looking after us... Especially my mother.

Trying to cheer HER up.<br>  <br>  I like to think I'm a better person for it, though. I like to think I'm understanding. I can cook pretty well.

Only you can let someone elses views of what you should look like taint your vision of what you think you should look like and therefore you go starting that anorexia BS! I don't feel sorry for ppl with that "disorder" because it is their choice to not eat. You feel your stomach rumbling, you know you haven't eaten, you look at  yourself in the mirror and can't possibly think that seeing your bones pertrude out of your body is cute or sexy! not to mention, why? what are you trying so hard to starve yourself for? how is starving yourself going to make your life better? Food is good....EAT IT DAMMIT! I have never felt sad for your kind of "disorder.' if you don't like your weight, run a mile or so then, get on treadmill, do something. I dislike my weight but i damn sure won't starve myself! i just don't get it! why do YOU do it? what are you trying to gain from it? plus you know you are anorexic and you know it's bad so why keep doing it? are you looking for attention, sympathy, like whats wrong with you?<br>  <br>  <br>  i'm not gonna say get help, do what you will, I"M EATING!|`|Ap8tyiUlaa	I feel sorry for them.<br>  I remember one day going into the bathroom at school and there was a girl i knew crying in the corner and then that day she left school to go to the hospital and was there for months because she was anorexic<br>  <br>  She was such a nice girl, and i felt really bad for her|`|59nnnZOAaa	i think people with anorexia should get help but sometimes i think it is for attention because i just find it hard to process how you could even do that to your body.|`|SYUWOlzraa	That they have a serious mental/emotional disorder and that they need to seek help to fix the problem.|`|BVaCJkxzaa	I think the are seeking attention in a very sick way.|`|5bdcd6fdade97ea18590869df8c0bcc0aa	I feel bad for them.

I believe it's comorbid with body dysmorphia. It's hard to get out of that mind frame. It's a difficult disorder to overcome as it deals with eating...something that you have to do and something that you're constantly faced with. I would strongly recommend one with an eating disorder to get help and to not be ashamed.|`|ii6Qe0tsaa	jesus ******* christ why are all your questions about eating disorders and anorexia,it's not my fault you didn't want the last piece of pizza god damn stuff your fat face in right now.You're like a attention grabbing whining little *****,go kill your self right now.|`|97b7d9795e7ae2ee4648b9cbb2fe32a4aa	your hurting yourself. && probably your family.<br>  i had a problem with diet pills when i was in high school.<br>  one day my ma found out, came to school & pulled me from class and just broke down. seeing what i was putting my ma through made me feel like a terrible person. she made me go to counseling && now everything is alll goooood =]<br>  <br>  you are a bit selfish. but what caused this? thats really the only thing you should be worrying about... & getting better.|`|UTZ2Lor4aa	i don't think they're selfish, they're all people with a different view on eating i guess. i don't think it's fair to judge people on things like that.<br>  <br>  obv they need help, but people are too quick in name calling and such. how would they feel if it was them who had the eating disorder?|`|OVONnYPaaa	If you realize that you have a problem than thats the first step.

AA10053661	I'd prefer to give my thoughts about what you wrote above in private. I guess I feel like I know too much and I just wanted to give you a few thoughts that might help you let go. <br>  <br>  I know you believe in Karma. And I know that if you truly believe in the Hindu faith you know that if you make it through this life you've been given you WILL be rewarded in the next life. You've learned so much....... not about yourself, but about the people around you. I think you understand why people are doing the things they are doing, and I think that every experience you have helps you understand yourself that much more as well. You are still so young and after seeing how you interact with people, I KNOW you are on your way to finding yourself and what is meaningful. It took me until I was over 36 to even remotely get into the ball park where I could then sit down and START to figure it out. So first of all..... know that you are not alone in feeling as you do.<br>  <br>  But you have to let go of the past. Don't forget it! Just don't dwell on it. Don't let it define you. You've grown so much since then. Let it help you game wisdom and experience.... but do not let it be your driving force. I've seen you let go and not dwell on things and you are the most intelligent, witty guy there is when you relax and let life just...... happen! <br>  <br>  Stop anticipating what is around the corner..... let it just come to you. Don't shut doors..... leave them cracked. You just never know who or what will venture in!!|`|uxFENkM3aa	Hun....she's not worth all that trouble and pain....no one is<br>  What you need to change is your attitude<br>  You need to start believing in yourself<br>  And next time you get that friendship bollocks...walk away <br>  Don't give up...there are allot of women out there who feel like you do...You'll find the right one for you<br>  <br>  If you need to talk mail or IM me<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you|`|3zynwZbXaa	i don't understand please elaborate
NzVwqpW5aa	Yes, I've had good advice on a number of subjects, including automotive repair, English questions, recipes and cooking, even refrigeration. <br>  <br>  The trick is to ask questions where people can give a factual answer, and to ask during the right time of day, basically before 2:00 pm, when bored but knowledgeable adults are online, and the kids are at school. Sometimes you get an answer from a real expert, and hey, it isn't costing you much to ask, right?|`|IML2SXoWaa	yes, I took some advices from yahoo answers.  but they didn't work.|`|kTTcwMh8aa	yeah. duh?|`|HXA2PUjgaa	most of them doesn't work|`|zJ2GKkwAaa	eh no<br>  =/

Your friends will be glad to help out too! Relax over the weekend and enjoy watching movies or just sitting around and talking.<br>  <br>  Don't give up on romance just because your life isn't like a movie, Taurus. One of the boys you know might actually be too shy to say he likes you, but if you relax and just be yourself it will make it easier for him to talk to you.<br>  <br>  Be sure you have a couple of classics in your wardrobe like a blazer, a really great skirt, or some simple silver accessories. You can build a lot of outfits around a great item (and it helps stretch the budget too!)|`|Q6pcAgBaaa	From all appearances, your life is busy, productive, and socially active this month, dear Taurus. Nevertheless, your sign’s ruler, lovely Venus, is retrograde from March 6th (until April 17th). Even in the week preceding its retrograde, Taureans tend to become more introspective, less companionable, and more cautious with expressing their feelings. Others very close to you could find you distant and hard to reach during this cycle. Venus in your twelfth house implies turning to the past, dealing with karma in love, and some self-sacrifice this month. It could be that a lover’s needs are greater than usual, and your needs and desires in love need to take a back seat. It could also mean there is a lot going on behind the scenes and others are likely to notice that you are emotionally distant. Past actions come back to visit you, and for some, past lovers reappear in person or in your thoughts to an unusual degree. Karmic circumstances are occurring now. Romance is more readily found through (or even with) friends and group associations the better part of the month.  A fabulous mood brings positive experiences and improved intimacy on the 9-12. Better days for love in March are the 1-2, 11-12, and 18-19.|`|BFvxkrBkaa	you will have to wait till may and then read the newspaper<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  xxx

She's very flawed, and funny. She's the one who clings on to the 'magic of the pants' and believes that her friendships with the others can heal just about anything, whether or not its true. I totally relate to that. She's not that confident either, but she certainly is stubborn. I think alot of girls can relate to that :)|`|JlYqg8z8aa	Lena gr8, wuv rory.  how funny was the beef between the gossip girl and ugly betty!|`|WbiJxmYRaa	LENA|`|o9p5kn1Baa	Lena
PS0oSoXFaa	I think the point of the movie (aka the reason they commited suicide) concerns their parents, who were so clueless and hokey and yet repressive at the same time. So I think the title is referring to this- the girls were "virgins" in the sense that they were prisoners; chastity (and good behavior and religion and everything else) was forced on them. And it shows how destructive this can be- the girls try to escape, first with the dance, then with suicide.<br>  <br>  Honestly, though, I didn't really think this movie worked. It just left me confused and wondering- OK? Is that all? I guess the ending just seemed a little silly and unbelievable, like it was forcing a point instead of being subtle, and then the point itself was kind of incoherent anyways. Hard to explain! But I attempted suicide once and it's nothing like that, at least it wasn't for me or for any of the suicidal people I've talked to<br>  <br>  But that's just my opinion; some film critics loved it, so who knows. And I've never read the book, maybe it's different|`|J8SC4xARaa	That was a good movie! And it was a book first so maybe it explains more in the book? I would imagine it might have something to do with how Kirsten Dunst's character got in so much trouble after she had sex. And how that kind of brought on all of that. But who knows.|`|Ha3xfatfaa	Good question, maybe because they were innocent and new to everthing... best bet is to google it.

In this context, anyone could be wrong, may be I myself can make a mistake. <br>  <br>  Apart, from mistake forget this as it will lead to wasteful involvement of your time and may be if you deeply think about it, it could lead you in depression.<br>  <br>  Try to make yourself busy. And when it comes to judging people don't give the initial judgment. have patience, and take time judging the people. <br>  <br>  And also try being friendly with your parents as parents are the best friends and they are someone who never ditch you.<br>  <br>  For your own peace of mind, start going to temple in the morning and the waviness of your mind would end up.<br>  <br>  Do rate ma answer so that i can know where i am upto.|`|W5h7UfZmaa	your starting to grow up and see people for who they  really are , don't worry too much about your JUDGING PEOPLE your friends had the same trouble <br>  When I think of those who have influenced my life  the most, I think of not of the great but the good --------keep in mind and good luck|`|fhkm3HGMaa	well people are bad.. i have real bad expieriences than U...

In the collection, "Shawshank" takes up about 19% of the page count (the four stories aren't all the same length).  Unless you find an edition of "DS" where the page count is way over 500 (such as a large print version), "Shawshank" should be around a hundred pages long in all of them.<br>  <br>  My paperback copy of "Different Seasons" is a "Stand By Me" movie tie-in.  Total pages are 506 and the table of contents is as follows:<br>  <br>  Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption -- 15 (94 pages)<br>  <br>  Apt Pupil -- 109 (180)<br>  <br>  The Body -- 289 (148)<br>  <br>  The Breathing Method -- 437 (62) <br>  <br>  Afterword -- 499 (7)|`|cyLUyhHMaa	'bout 96

K4lRi1fjaa	G'day 5Big1s,<br>  <br>  Thank you for your question.<br>  <br>  So far, it has received pretty good reviews with Q and Rolling Stone giving it five stars. It is receiving comparisons to Achtung Baby. Rolling Stone readers are giving it 4 stars.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would listen to some of the tracks on Grooveshark or another service to make up your own mind.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com/" rel="nofollow">http://listen.grooveshark.com/</a><br>  <br>  Regards|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	They are from Ireland but U2 is complete rubbish! Bono is so full of himself, I'm surprised that he has time for his patting himself on the back good deeds.|`|19nQDjEmaa	Rolling Stone Magazine rated it a 5 star! It sounds like it is going to be an awesome album!|`|xM50DXFQaa	Im from Ireland.....I never liked any of their songs....I really don't see why everyone thinks they are a "Great Band"....The're crap!!<br>  <br>  xxx|`|eeKlogL4aa	It was pretty predictable and not all that great...|`|oIIiMY5Zaa	I think it sounds good|`|wpfq6otDaa	I think the album is one of the most creative, interesting and innovative pieces of work the band has done in years.<br>  <br>  Stupid people don't get U2 because they think music should just numb their senses and not make them think.  But seeing as how U2 is now embarking on their third decade of great music, I can at least rest assured at night knowing the stupid people aren't the majority of this world.

lX3gVfw2aa	It is Wednesday. If it was any other day of the week, more than one statement would be true. To solve the riddle, evaluate each person's statement and write down what day it could be according to the statement. David's statement indicates it could be any day of the week except for Wednesday. When you list the days that it could be according to each person's statement, it turns out Wednesday is the day mentioned only one time. <br>  <br>  Darryl: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. <br>  Tracy: Monday. <br>  Melissa: Saturday. <br>  Ben: Thursday. <br>  Adrienne: Saturday. <br>  Susie: Friday .<br>  David: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday or Saturday.|`|3mE3w1Toaa	tracy|`|PRndShl1aa	It is Monday. :)|`|w7G3PVIuaa	tracy is right|`|39OVFs5Raa	Well, if you saw it, shouldn't you know what day of the week it was???.|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	Susie is correct because today is Friday Feb 27th so that means "Tomorrow is Saturday" is true.

n1y67ZNuaa	ive never really heard of people breaking there knees in autumn.
gIjnoEi5aa	After her performance this week, I REALLY like Allison's voice!  I was a little apprehensive on Tuesday night when I heard she'd be singing Heart's, "Alone," because Carrie Underwood sang it back in season 4 and killed it! It was basically the moment where she stepped out as a star. However, I was pleasantly surprised when Allison sang it. As Paula and Kara said when Allison was named one of the top 36, the girl has "raw natural talent!" As long as she keeps choosing songs that suit her voice I'm sure she'll make it far in the competition.<br>  <br>  As for the guys, I have two that I really like and one of them has already made it to the top 12...that would be Danny Gokey.  His story broke my heart, but what's cool is that he's not letting his wife's death make him bitter. He had the best performance by far last week.  Now, as much as I wanna see Danny do well, I'm a huge fan of Anoop Desai! I fell in love with his voice during his initial audition when he sang, "Thank You," by Boyz II Men. He has an amazing voice, which is absolutely gorgeous! I also found out that he sang in an all male a cappella (sp?) group for the University of North Carolina and watched clips of the performances on You Tube. After watching those clips it made me want him to succeed even more.  I'm pretty upset that Michael Sarver beat him out for the 3rd spot in the top 12.  (Alexis Grace was the highest voted girl and Danny Gokey was the highest voted guy). Now, Michael IS very likable, but Anoop has a MUCH stronger voice. I just wish he had chosen a song other than, "Angel of Mine," because it didn't showcase his amazing vocal ability.  Therefore, I'm going to pray that he makes it in the wild card round because I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY want to see him in the top 12!|`|AA12390047	So far I only like Adam and Danny.  No girl yet.|`|NqcnAnC1aa	I don't have a favorite girl yet because so far, I haven't seen anyone that really interests me.  But I would say Allison is the best female singer so far.<br>  And as for guys, I really like Danny.  He has a beautiful voice and he's my favorite contestant so far...  Followed closely by Adam Lambert.|`|zdrXmriAaa	My favorite guy is definitely Adam. He's a great great singer with mad skills, and he's sexy too. :))<br>  As for the girls, I love Alexis. She's really cool. :D|`|jUg9HAOjaa	Adam, Alexis Grace, the 2 red-heads and Tatiana|`|7ciDto6Daa	My favorite boys are Danny & Adam.<br>  I don't have a fav girl yet.|`|Vl9jNPJNaa	I like Danny Gokey because he has the voice that could sing different songs perfectly, but the show always focus on his dead wife story which kinda frustrating for me~ they should focus more on his singing... I also love Kris Allen because he is good looking and he also put a lot of energy on his performance. However, being surrounded by a bunch of strong contender is definitely a cons for him because he did not owned a powerful voice as Danny, Adam or Allison did.. as for the girl, i probably choose Allison Iraheta because she knows what she wanted and she worked her axx off for it, however, i think she has to be consistent because she looks like the boring flying-under-the-radar contestants in every seasons who cant make it to the final 12...<br>  <br>  P.S: do you think Allison Iraheta looks just like Kelly Clarkson????<br>  <br>  :)|`|xCru9z7Raa	ANOOP DESAI IS AWESOME!!!  he's got the total package...humility and amazing talent!  watch him on youtube with the UNC clef hangers - you'll know exactly what i mean!!

I wish she made it through. I think it stinks that they go from 12 to 3 in one night. Some people who are good blew it for the first time when it really mattered. Sooo sad =-(  Oh I also like Lil Rounds! Shes good too|`|nUoHXzLPaa	Adam Lambert and Alison Iraheta|`|YxwA5sjwaa	So far, Alexis Grace and Danny Gokey.|`|SatGmBHYaa	Kris Allen.

Is it REALLY their music anyway? lol<br>  Songwriters sell their work for thousands of dollars and the musicians get paid millions to sing it. That part I don't understand. Don't get me wrong there are some legit musicians who actually do write their own material and sing it but it's ridiculous how they are going to make a fuss over downloading songs that originally weren't even theirs! They can charge an outrageous fee to go see them in concert, have you spend an outrageous fee on a concert t shirt which costs pennies to make and they are going to cry like a baby cause their music is being downloaded? Gimmie a break. The music industry is a FOR PROFIT buisness, they could care less if you are a fan or not because they will rake in millions anyways without you.<br>  As far as downloading illegally, yes that is banned but people still do it. I do. My ex husband does.

Ec7836mGaa	horrible movie<br>  way too drawn out, even if it stayed somewhat true to the original novel there were several parts that were unnecessary<br>  the plot was horrible and characters frustrating <br>  i like the idea that it was trying to portray and all the symbolism but it got to be too much symbolism and it felt like the same message of human brutality over and over again<br>  it was somewhat confusing<br>  poor acting<br>  death was used too much<br>  it was a good filmed movie, great special effects<br>  i like all the action but even for me it was too much violence<br>  overall i love the idea of the movie but i hate the way it was made|`|m0xehTLqaa	i read the comic books and i thought it was amazing. they did such a good job on  it, the sex scene, was the only part they messed up|`|mDsZtyMmaa	you have to read the novel first to fully understand it because the plot line is kinda complicated|`|KlkUj6uFaa	You really need start a relationship or something.<br>  <br>  I thought the movie was amazing.|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	Long and fairly boring.|`|oNJPw4P5aa	Today I saw It.

I did not read the book and I give the movie a 6/10|`|kGkUG0fKaa	i thought it was an awesome movie but i have yet to read the book or anything.

NyTlXmUqaa	hated it|`|7d4cba081658a3d983af242ee5c7b43daa	I've read the graphic novel and it is a masterpiece, the movie however was mixed. I was kinda disappointed. <br>  <br>  I didn't like the over-the-top fighting scenes (when it was suppose to be a realistic take on superheroes) and some of the music didn't fit (most notably the over exaggerated sex scene) it made the movie felt cheesy when it was suppose to be treated seriously. <br>  <br>  I enjoyed some of the performances, Jackie Haley and Billy Crudup were spot on with their characters as Rorschach and the Comedian. Nite Owl was great, while Dr. Manhattan was fair but Silk Spectre and Oxymandias fell flat. The main story stayed true to the source material but I still missed the details and sub-plots that made the graphic novel so legendary and realistic.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	I loved it. I thought the script was written well and had a lot of wit in it. I have never read the book so I have nothing to compare it to yet (will read the book now) but for me it was worth the damn near 3hrs!<br>  <br>  I will say that if i didn't read the synopsis of each character and the story before hand in the newspaper I would have been a bit lost....<br>  <br>  I will say that the acting was not the best but I mean...still it was a really good movie. However i see that there are a lot of ups and downs to how people feel about this film and I can understand their points of view, it was drawn out and some parts were boring but I say if a movie that long can keep me interested...its worth 8 out 10 stars!|`|0BRnovJYaa	loved it! It was so visually interesting. Just like the movie 300, which was directed by the same guy, there was lots of cool imagery. I was into the story and entertained by scenes like when Rorschach threw the boiling oil on that criminals face. that was awesome. Dr. Manhatten was awesome. I loved the political plotline, something that's missing from most superhero movies. It was definitely not your typical superhero movie, but it was very well done and I want to see it again! (I didn't even read the book or know what the story was about before I went to see it. It was a little confusing because of this, but not so bad that I lost interest.)|`|Z47piiikaa	I loved the watchmen novel as well as the movie.  I think every GUY in the qorld loves watchmen, just because its like a porno mixed with fighting.  It also has a great script and shows a good meening at the end.  Plus, the comedian is such a badass!|`|m0xehTLqaa	i LOVED it, it was amazing. it was exactly like the comic books. they didnt change anything important or big. zach snider did an incredible job. any comic book fan or not will appriciate it|`|8f7d6676160b4b85e787148539be7f61aa	I just saw it several hours ago. Very shitty, I mean, whole movie was so boring. I want my 9 dollars back............|`|uIZDd3y5aa	I've never seen it, but I heard it was good.|`|18K7ucsEaa	The movie was alright, I think everyone should read the book before going to the movie just to make sure they know what they are getting themselves into. I knew that it was supposed to be a little unorthodox going into it, but at first I thought it was an action movie, then I thought it was a murder mystery, then I thought it was a romance... as things turn out, it's just an idea about sacrifice... who knew?<br>  <br>  As far as the actual movie: there is a pretty awesome sex scene to the tune of 'Hallelujah,' and a decent amount of brutal violence (i.e. a lot of people get their s**t broke LOL). The storyline is easy to follow, just kinda complicated to understand.<br>  <br>  Even at 3 hours, there wasn't enough character development for me...<br>  <br>  4/10 stars - nice try   :-D|`|KlkUj6uFaa	AMAZING!<br>  <br>  I loved it.|`|yqe0I5zpaa	I saw it last night, i was quite impressed. Zack Snyder truly delivered, he stayed as true to the graphic novel as he possibly could, i know their was squid at the end, but the "changed" ending was better, it tied everything together nicely. Jeffery Dean Morgan, Billy Crudup and Jackie Earle Haley demolished their roles, they were the perfect casting choices. I thought that the only flaw was that the movie wasn't even trying at all to be different from the source material, it couldn't do anything with it, the actors barely had any room to bring something to their role and breath. Heath Ledger created a different Joker, darker, more pushing, more intense style, much different than the source material, and it worked, as an actor, you would like to bring something different, your own style to a role. The graphic novel was written in such a cinematic element, all the sections were drawn almost as if you could see them move, hear them breath and feel them. The movie feels like you've seen it before. Also, Matthew Goode was a terrible choice for Ozy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Final Grade:    B-|`|4WCLWhaTaa	If you want to see a bunch of the worse of the human condition dressed in latex (if they are dressed at all) get more and more depressing for three hours of your life and if you have the uppers to deal with it then sure. <br>  It was senselessly violent (as in the violence served no purpose in some of the scenes other than gee...we can show bones) and extremely predictable. If you didn't know who the bad guy was from the get go then you need to go back to Scooby cartoons. <br>  I read the books when I was about thirteen and didn't remember them being that depressing (or having quite that much blue phallus). <br>  The one character I liked committed a form of blue suicide...<br>  Just blah. I want those three hours of my life back.|`|11dGXLchaa	I hated it.   It really sucked.    They kept showing some blue dude's penis.   I thought I was gonna puke.    Unless you are a woman or a gay homosexual, you're gonna hate this film.|`|wdsN94fnaa	It was good because <br>  1) Rorschach is pimp. (The mask is awesome)

tCUjQN1Iaa	All rappers are against Illuminati, some just rap more about it than others.  Illuminati is a group of families who rule the world.  They decide who will be presidents in particular countries, they finance wars and control the worlds population.  <br>  <br>  You should listen to K'naan.  He does not speak specifically about Illuminati but his lyrics are socially and politically motivated.|`|KF9751Lyaa	I've heard of illuminati but I've never really bothered to research on it & I heard that it had something to do with Tupac's death so I'm gonna research it & watch a few things on it =]|`|r7xSbMbaaa	What is the illuminati?

Rh8aSDzeaa	28 Days Later by a mile. In my honest opinion, everything about 28 Days Later is more superior. 28 Weeks Later lacked the depth, intelligence, character development, psychological suspense, and acting of the first film. Not to mention it lacked the fantastic directing of Danny Boyle, who was only a producer for 28 Weeks Later.|`|V1hxvQukaa	28 days later. that is one of my fav movies... it's not just a horror movie with half-naked chicks running up stairs when they should be running out doors. not to mention that the music in it is great...<br>  <br>  28 weeks later isn't bad, but 28 days later is DEFINITELY better.|`|05CKkwZTaa	I really like both movies and they were blood great. With music, actors, plot and action they really hit the nail on the head.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	ooooh...I liked both but I think 28 weeks later was a little better..wait..I dont know...(thinking of both films.....give me a sec...)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  yea you're right the 1st one 28 days later was better but 28 weeks later is still a good movie....I love it.|`|L4jMOVvPaa	28 days if by far better.in the second one you kind of know what to expect. That aside its got a far better story behind it as well.|`|PkC1Sk8Qaa	28 Weeks, more action packed and intense.

Zombies shouldn't run. Watch George Romero movies instead.|`|LLOSNqxmaa	28 days later i think. i like how the zombies moved fast unlike the usual walking ones.|`|OjERIM3Paa	28 Days later for sure.

Its hard to judge by one song.|`|pLPKo6mBaa	Oh yeah I've heard a few songs from their Breaking Ground album, they're pretty good.

You are clearly start with DBZ by watching the anime. The anime have a tons of filler episode, filler character and filler saga. 100 episodes make sense if they follow the ORIGINAL manga storyline and edit out the dragged fighting like for example, that dragging power up usually takes 2-4 episode to finish.|`|cmAAcXLNaa	If you're talking about the remastered series then no.<br>  I've never heard of this.<br>  The remastered Dragon Ball Z series has 9 season with 276 Episodes like usual.<br>  It may seem like less because there are 16 sagas put into 9 season (so about two sagas per season)<br>  <br>  So no way are they making/made it like that!

You can offer support.<br>  <br>  It's funny, whether you think you've had a good life or not... it's how you look at things. There are people that have been through a lot more than I have, that would say their life has been great -- that they have some amazing memories. There are people who have hardly been touched by all the bad in the world, and yet they remain so sure that they've had a terrible life.

Then I went to public school, but only for a short period because my mum couldn't cope with buying all the uniform and paying for everything. So I started to be homeschooled. I have to say my favourite out of all the schools I went to was when my mum homeschooled me. She was a teacher herself but she got fired for missing work.

Bart and Stewie would end up killing eachother right away, while Homer and Peter drink a beer and watch Marge and Lois fight it out. Meanwhile, Lisa would be beating Meg to death with her saxophone. Then, after Meg is dead, Brian would get really pissed off and rip Santa's Little Helper's stomach open.. Then, both Homer and Peter would die of alcohol poisoning. Then, Lois and Marge would realise that the war is pointless and become lesbian lovers. So nobody would win.

ZOkJmrWwaa	The 13th episode of season 3 is "Our Father." <br>  <br>  To stop Arthur once and for all, Hiro and Claire travel back 16 years in time to when Hiro's father, Kaito, handed baby Claire to Noah, while Peter teams up with the Haitian to finally stop Arthur, only to be intercepted by Sylar. In the meantime, Mohinder has a major breakthrough in the formula after Arthur obtains the catalyst that will change everything and the catalyst is lost forever. <br>  <br>  read more here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Father_(Heroes)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Father_...</a><br>  <br>  an overview of the entire third season can be found here: <a href="http://heroeswiki.com/Season_Three" rel="nofollow">http://heroeswiki.com/Season_Three</a><br>  <br>  Although, if you're confused and wondering why the feel of the show has changed in the current (4th) season, it's because the show now has all new executive producers.

Once they get the cash they follow eachother and try to get the media's attention then they just end up nowhere.|`|q1EV0j1Saa	well their pictures get spread around like butter all over the place because we have the internet now. i'm sure even annette funicello did some "scandalous" things in her day, they just didn't have all this new technology that we have now. <br>  the new disney stars really should watch what they do.|`|jH4RGbrNaa	dey juz say "we were having a girls night and we were having fun but somehow it leaked all over the internet" < i think dahs bullsh*t <br>  The media makes us believe it and dey exsagerate so much and brainwash us|`|YQQzHl1vaa	i think to made sensation, so she can be more popular  ...|`|JHOlfb1jaa	Because Disney can't afford decent respectful people...so they just pick the trampy ones of the streets...|`|YhuH2k4Caa	because just like us, they are perverts only they are not allowed to show such a side.|`|QziRcmTJaa	i don't think Disney stars are the only celebs who do scandalous things. there are many other celebs who do stuff worse than this.<br>  besides, you only give two examples of people, and vanessa - she took that pic for her ex-boyfriend way before she was famous. she probably didn't even know that she'd be a role-model to kids a few years later.<br>  <br>  as of miley, i have no comment. she's ridiculous! i could forgive her if she learns from her mistakes but to do it lots and lots of time, when she knows there are 8-year-old girls who look up to her, that's just stupid. and worst of all, she blames us and the media for making little things bigger than it should be (like the mocking pic, and her cleavage pic). i lost all respect for her. :/|`|sxk08R2caa	don't forget miley and ashley's kiss: <a href="http://cm1.theinsider.com/media/0/49/45/0118_cyrus_ashley_tisdale_startraks.0.0.0x0.432x637.jpeg" rel="nofollow">http://cm1.theinsider.com/media/0/49/45/...</a><br>  <br>  i had so much respect for ashley before i saw this because i thought she hadn't done anything and now i've lost all respect for her|`|ec4yhkhuaa	not all of them do.<br>  only 2.<br>  <br>  i cant see selena gomez, demi lovato or the jonas brothers doing anything like that.<br>  <br>  xo|`|1945ddd3e3bf4d0537d95dec0c73cfb9aa	disney tries to grab the attention of media or it is just coincidence that all the people turn out to be such s*****

Beatfreaks owned the season basically, but after last episode... Quest worked them, hard! I've never seen two better back to back performances.

It's hard to choose. I think overall I'd choose Beat Freaks, but based on that last episode I'll go with Quest.<br>  <br>  I don't care which one wins between the two, but I think it's going to be Quest. I still don't know who to root for.|`|VuFHViizaa	Quest crew all the way! They are soooooo good and last night they killed it!

AA11065099	I am glad I saw this question at a time when I can actually recall a part of a dream that I had.  I think it was early in the morning, just before I woke up, and not last night.  I only remember the tail end of my dream.<br>  <br>  In it, this one cousin of mine who makes a lot of money was riding around in a small private airplane that resembles a convertible car to some extent because it had no top.  He was hovering over the city where he used to live, waving at everyone like a celebrity.  He was very conceited and thought everyone would be thrilled to see him.  I guess you could say that the dream was not pleasant and bordered on a nightmare.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	It was so stupid.  I was working for the Monkees.

qgE8E70Qaa	Yeah, I think she's half Hispanic because one of her parents is Mexican and the other is white.

In business the question is just as hard to nail down to a simple yes or no, but I lean more toward no. It is good if your employees like you, and can definitely be beneficial, but it is far more important that they respect you as a person and as a leader.<br>  <br>  <br>  This is also where the need to balance respect and likability comes in. The adage "it is better to be feared than loved" is an extreme that rarely works in a business environment.<br>  My advice is to treat everyone fairly and equitably. Earn people's trust and acceptance through the job you do in leading them. If you do this, people will respect you, even if they don't invite you to their next barbecue.|`|AA11238703	yes, because it makes your life more wonderful.  it feels great to connect with people and enjoy them and be with them.  however there are other needs that are just as important like authenticity (being yourself) and integrity and respect.  never sacrifice those things to try to get liked.|`|gUPUSTEuaa	I use to think that it was important but now I know that has longes I got good people that love me , the people that don't like me don't matter to me.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	It used to be.

Whoever Jason picks I wish them well. That's nice about your friend being Molly's cousin!! Her family seems really nice too.|`|AA12390047	I think Molly!<br>  Wow - your friend wore all the hats?  That's so cool.<br>  I think he'll first make us think it's Melissa but it'll end up being Molly.  He says he loves both of them.  And he said earlier that Molly was the best kisser.|`|NqcnAnC1aa	I think it will be Melissa.  He seems to really like her and he lights up when she's around.

She tends to say that alot, and that just shows me she's a little immature.<br>  <br>  I was a little upset that he didn't get to meet Melissa's family. And I also think with Deanna coming back to talk to him, I think it might remind him of Melissa and how he compares her to his ex's and stuff, and that might ruin it for Melissa.<br>  <br>  Deanna annoys me, she had a chance, and ruined it, she's a celebrity chaser.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	I really don't know but he was on The View today and they showed a clip from the final show of him crying hysterically when he sees something or someone.

I know he is facing up to 30 years in prison. ><<br>  <br>  FYI, <br>  <br>  Rapper T.I. in deep trouble over gun sting. He tries to buy machine guns. T.I Atlanta rap star T.I, the self-proclaimed 'king of the south', is staring down..<br>  <br>  Rapper T.I. in deep trouble over gun sting<br>  He tries to buy machine guns. Atlanta rap star T.I, the self-proclaimed 'king of the south', is staring down the barrel of major jail time this week after his high-profile arrest following an attempt to purchase an arms cache.<br>  <br>  The musician was arrested by police in Atlanta, George, just hours before he was due to attend the B.E.T. Hip-hop awards, after an undercover operation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). According to reports, T.I. caught attempting to purchase an arsenal of weapons, including three machine guns and two silencers from the cop, posing as an arms dealer.<br>  <br>  The hip-hop star, real name Clifford Harris Jr, instructed his bodyguard, who was acting as a co-operating witness to the agents from the ATp, to buy the weapons worth around ￡10,500.<br>  <br>  The employee claims he has purchased a total of nine guns for Harris Jr, and a further 17 other firearms for his associated, since he was hired in July, despite T.I.'s previous convictions which prevent him owning firearms. additionally, a further three machine guns and six other firearms were discovered in a closet at his home following a police raid.<br>  <br>  T.I was charged with felony possession of unregistered machine guns and silencers and possession of firearms by a convicted felon, and will be released before a U.S. Magistrate today to determine if bail can be sought. <br>  written by on 15/10/2007 14:52:00<br>  <a href="http://www.tourdates.co.uk/news/11585-Rapper-TI-in-deep-trouble-over-gun-sting" rel="nofollow">http://www.tourdates.co.uk/news/11585-Ra...</a>|`|q8bJzyUaaa	ha ha|`|JDyHE9myaa	he should spend the rest of his life in prison, he is not a changed man he is a menace to society

cQotXhMpaa	Yes.  The actual title is called "Sea Lion Woman."  It derives from music collected from the fields of Mississippi back in 1939 for the Library of Congress. It's a ***** spiritual. It's perhaps the most moving, most haunting and most chilling moments of the movie.  Within two minutes of the movie, with this song, sets the tone of the movie.  The song fits great with the movie.  A movie about lies and betrayal.  I have added a link to Amazon.com of others who where moved by this song.

x7QFtMZIaa	Well the most important thing is networking. Get to know as many people as possible who works in the field. Look up artist talks at schools, go to conventions, ask friends, use your school resources. I am a sequential art (comics) and animation major at SCAD, the savannah college of art and design, and there they prepare you for the actual career rather than just teaching the technical side of the career. Many people get into the animation career with the most rudimentary of skills but end up making successful because of the people they know. If you are on a good relation with the people you work with, they are more willing to let you have an extra chance if you are unable to get some projects done on time, or when you are still learning.<br>  Next thing is, think small with your goals, then compile them into larger ones. I'm not too sure about the animation colleges in India, but in the US, Ringling and SCAD are some of the top ranked colleges for animation, game design, and other digital programs. Also, try to learn as much about computer programs like Maya, Adobe Flash, Autodesk 3D max, Shader, etc. Though youhave a C in computer science, you want to extend your knowledge as far as possible. I would suggest taking cinematography or sequential art classes because they help with the animation processes. A lot of people I know did not realize that until they get into the industry and they end up getting the stick because they don't have the ability to think like a photographer. In animation, composition is a huge part of the job too, not just learning how to model, rig, nor animate. Make sure you take a lot of art classes too, the concepts from drawing classes would help, I know a lot of people who didnt think so, but now they are regretting it.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your endeavor, and disney huh? Why not try pixar? It's much more reputable and the quality of their work is, in my opinion, much better and much more memorable. Will Eisner killed Disney when he started creating sequals to their movies.

Later, Vineeth performed many stage shows in India and abroad.

That way, you're simulating the experience of original Star Wars fans! MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!|`|6W61fS5paa	My suggestion is, start with old trilogy. <br>  So the order of the episodes should be -> 4-5-6-1-2-3<br>  <br>  <br>  Because the main story is old trilogy(4-5-6), new trilogy explains the events before old trilogy. Also the visual effects of new trilogy is better, it is better to watch after old trilogy. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, old trilogy is much better than new trilogy.|`|5kLH68pPaa	Watch them in order of story, start with Episode One:Phantom Menace and go from there.

AA10368887	James Brolin can go to hell. Anyone who makes jokes about 9/11 is a jerk and a lowlife:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/09152007/gossip/pagesix/james_brolins_9_11_gaffe.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nypost.com/seven/09152007/gos...</a><br>  <br>  September 15, 2007 -- JAMES Brolin came down with a huge case of foot-in-mouth disease when he cheerfully wished everybody "Happy 9/11!" on a radio show. The not-so-smart hubby of Barbra Streisand was on New Haven's WPLR Tuesday to hype his movie "The Hunting Party" when hosts Chaz and AJ noted it was the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks. "Right, oh, yeah, Happy 9/11!" Brolin crowed. A horrified Chaz shot back, "Well, that's kind of a weird thing to say," to which Brolin laughed, "Ha, ha, ha! I hear silence." Chaz explained, "Yeah, well, we're right outside of New York, and I know people who lost family members, so . . . we don't say, 'Happy 9/11' around here." Brolin, still giddy, chirped: "Celebrate the day, right?" He then tried to cover his stupidity by calling it a "horrible situation" but was cut off by Chaz, who coldly noted, "I think you'd be better off talking about this movie." WPLR program director Ed Sabatino told us listeners have burned up the studio lines for days to rip Brolin's insensitivity. The actor's manager, Jeff Wald, insisted he wasn't making fun of the tragedy and "was horrified by it. It was an off-the-cuff remark." Streisand's reps didn't return calls.

This, like all the rest, applies to the average undeveloped human being. <br>  <br>  The motto of those who find in the Zodiacal science the explanation of their domestic infelicity should be "Blessed is he who overcomes."<br>  <br>  If  through this knowledge one can account for the in-harmony which sometimes prevails, such information should be a grand assistance instead of a matter of discouragement, because when a cause is understood a remedy can usually be found.<br>  <br>  With such understanding, it is possible for married people to become more to each other instead of growing farther apart, and this beautiful process can be accomplished by a careful study of self and a determination to overcome the ob-stacles which have prevented happiness.|`|SlhdAZzpaa	Yeah, its against the law of aquarius to love scorpios!!<br>  <br>  or just maybe some scorpios are cute..<br>  <br>  LOL..

JYw3hRV8aa	Apparently he and Kubrick consulted one another during filming but when the film was released King denounced it. He felt it strayed too far from the storyline and intention of the novel. That is the movie is more about coping with the isolation whilst the book is more interested in Danny's gift.|`|WX1b747Iaa	You are aware that he remade it his own way, using the actual resort hotel that inspired it for the exterior shots.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Kings-Shining-Disc-Special/dp/B000077VRT" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Kings-Shin...</a>|`|76140b1733cd124dbe960a504bc06f8daa	How does Stephen King feel about Kubrick's adaptation of his book?<br>  <br>  Initially King was flattered that Kubrick was going to do something of his. Later he expressed disappointment in the film. "There's a lot to like about it. But it's a great big beautiful Cadillac with no motor inside, you can sit in it and you can enjoy the smell of the leather upholstery - the only thing you can't do is drive it anywhere. So I would do every thing different. The real problem is that Kubrick set out to make a horror picture with no apparent understanding of the genre. Everything about it screams that from beginning to end, from plot decision to the final scene - which has been used before on the Twilight Zone"<br>  <br>  King had the chance to "do everything different" with the I997 TV movie adaptation of The Shining which he wrote and produced. However the TV Shining was poorly received and generally considered to be vastly inferior to the Kubrick's version. Friction between Kubrick and King was probably further exasperated because Kubrick refused King the rights to release his version of The Shining on video.<br>  <br>  Recently it has emerged that King used to be an alcoholic, and that parts of The Shining are, if not autobiographical, then very personal for the author. King was annoyed because Kubrick's adaptation, in his eyes, marginalised the book's most important theme, that of an good father can be turned into a monster through alcohol abuse.

xTioPxaVaa	The guitar sound, especially on the early Metallica records, is very much a product of the studio.  Back then, James would record his guitar parts up to 9 times (3 left, 3 center, and 3 right).  There were all kinds of tricks that were used in the studio, such as building a tent around the amp with sound deadening material, and then mic'ing the amp from a distance under that tent.  It made for some interesting tones.<br>  <br>  A lot of this is going to depend on the guitar you have.  If you've got a Fender style guitar with single coild pickups, it's just not going to sound like Metallica (at least, not the heavy parts).<br>  <br>  If you've got a guitar with humbuckers, you can get in the neighborhood of that sound by maxing out the gain.  I'd probably start with Bass/Mid/Treble at 4,8,6.  None (or very little) reverb.  Then adjust the master to control your volume.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that the fact that 4x12 cabinets were used, that's going to sound a lot different than a single speaker combo.  But, that will get you going.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken

xTioPxaVaa	Ugh...for playing a 12-string passage.  They're great for getting a full rhythm sound, but extremely difficult to play lead on.  That's where the 6 sting neck comes in.<br>  <br>  Double-neck guitars have been around for a long long time, but were really made popular by Jimmy Page.  Jimmy had his made by Gibson so that he could approximate songs like "Stairway to Heaven", "The Rain Song", and others live.  Later you would see artists like Steve Howe (Yes) and Rik Emmett (Triumph) use the 12-string necks for recorded acoustic parts, and then switch to the 6 string for leads.<br>  <br>  I've got a Carvin 12/6 double neck I bought in 1977 (that's what I'm playing in my picture).  It's a fun guitar, but it's heavy as all get out and a royal pain to restring (when you think about , it's like restringing 3 guitars in one sitting).<br>  <br>  If you want to turn a crowd's head, pull a double neck out.  But, I would not recommend it as a primary guitar for performance.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken|`|VXQFT341aa	For playing.

xpowJMNTaa	they are all still property of the company that made them, so for example, you should see a r with a circle around it on toys in most cases. After the ending of the film, credit still must be given to these companies, or must be relinquish any ownership like "I do not own any of these characters or etc etc, and the give credit." This only is the case if your going to post them on the internet or distribute them. If its only for a class project with a very small audience or personal use you should be fine without a statement.

You both have the personality for freedom and let and let live.<br>  But your Venus in leo shows that you would prefer someone bombastic, a little loud and a little show-off wouldn't turn you off.

3a9f3003abdd986d136bc7307c02868faa	You know how it is Whip, people believe what they read in the papers, and forget that things are said when people go through a breakup that are said out of hurt. <br>  <br>  I like Jeff, always have, and until someone gives me concrete proof of a reason not to, I always will.<br>  <br>  People should keep their mouths shut about things that they have not been there to witness personally and comment purely on the stuff that we are seeing for sure. How many of those complaining are above reproach, we've all made mistakes in our lives especially during emotional times.|`|z03coR1Oaa	I've never got the impression that he was a bad dad but i know what you mean the press are just stirring things up there will be no contest jack won't get the kids because he's an **** jackie shouldn't get then because before jade got ill jade was mothering jackie more than jackie mothering jade jeff is the right person to look after the boy's because he's there dad.|`|CuTvFlxTaa	Well unless there is evidence, then they cant prove anything. The children are far better of with him than Jack Tweed. At this young age and emotional time they need to have contact with Jack too, its not their fault their mum fell for a bad boy. However when they grow up then they may decide otherwise.|`|aKhZNd7daa	I've personally always thought Jeff a good Dad Whip - whenever you do see him pictured in the paper with the Bobby & Freddie they always seem to be happy and smiling and I'm sure he probably provides for the boys in monetary terms as well.|`|AA11349925	I've not heard this said at all, what ever he is, he's a darn site better then Tweed, I can't believe Jade wan't that thug hanging around her kids! she even wanted him to have joint custody with the lesbian drug addict grandmother! Jeff should get full custody of those boys because he is their dad and Jade's mum should be greatful for visitation (supervised) as for Tweed hopefully he will crawl back to whatever ditch he dragged himself out of.|`|DtU1EpoVaa	I think at the moment he is just trying be there for his kids which is far more important then money they are so young money wont mean anything to them but the lost of their mother will and thank the lord he isn't trying to cash in on the fact he is the father of her kids there are many a sicko that would try and cash in on that fact.<br>  Am sure once Jade passes away Jack will do that he seems that type of person|`|HnNJAJeJaa	I Agree with you totally..Ive seen nothing to suggest he isnt a good dad.He is a much better role model for jades boys than jack will be,and thats what matters...Think jeff is a decent sort of bloke,and he seems very private....|`|1sP3dJlnaa	I would question his taste in ever getting with her in the first place whip, but nobody has the right to judge him without being directly involved, he can't be any worse than Jade's mother or that twat she married.|`|akcGfgdcaa	Yeah I agree, and he seems like a much better person than Jade's husband anyway.|`|Q7Sy9Cnraa	I wasn't aware that people think he's a bad Dad at all.! ;0<br>  <br>  He comes across as a really devoted Father to them two Boys of his,..you can see it when he talks about them in public on rare occasions,..his beaming smile says it all! ;)<br>  <br>  Jack Tweed isn't the best person for the Boys to be with IMO,..he's very immature and i don't trust him to be honest.<br>  <br>  If i had Kids,and i knew i was dying i would definitely do all i could to provide for my Kids future just like what Jade has been doing these last months.<br>  <br>  She's only doing what all Good Parents would do.<br>  <br>  I'm quite sure Jeff will support his Sons also,..it's obvious he loves them very very much. ;)|`|AA10077992	I agree with you 100%. He seems a decent sort of a chap to me and not only has Jade expressed in her wishes that the boys live with him - more importantly - they seem to WANT to live with their dad but have lots of access with their nan - who, BTW, has been a ROCK through all this.<br>  Given 6 months down the line, I doubt that Jack will feature much in their thoughts - GOOD|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	I haven't heard this at all H nor do I think it either.  I did wonder why he hadn't been around but have just read in yesterday's paper (I was behind lol!!) that the boys have spent the last week with him and he has promised Jade he will look after them.  They are far better off with Jeff than with Tweed who seems to think violence is an ok everyday occurence and their grandmother, however much she has turned things around, would not be able to look after them properly.  They will have by far a better upbringing with Jeff than Jack or Jackiey could provide and will get the education denied Jade.  I feel they are going to turn out two very emotionally stable boys and will do well in life.  That's all Jade could wish for.

It keeps the house so nice and clean.  No tracked in dirt, no kids who stepped in gum and don't know it, no dog poop surprises, and no scratches on flooring.  It lets the shoes air out, keeps stepped-on-finger injuries to a minimum, and keeps shoes where they can easily be found.  When we have company, and they see us take off our shoes, they usually do also, and don't mind at all.  I highly recommend it.|`|Iv81N1Geaa	Taake them off (:|`|zPUgLT7Aaa	Depends to be honest :)<br>  Are slippers shoes ?<br>  ohh i don't think they are .,,, ii think slippers  are just slippers lol <br>  do slippers count thiough ?<br>  ii wear slippers in th house :)<br>  But noo i generally take my shoes off unless i come in and then im going back out again lol <br>  well actually in that case if my shoes were muddy and wet of course i would take them off lol<br>  :) x|`|ZzyEhSB1aa	Take them off always|`|70a47f94503a1953542e060626fbb52caa	I actually take my shoes off because it will ruin the carpet after a while.

a1Ngi39Xaa	That is the saddest thing I have heard in a long time.  Chris Cornell is or now was one of my very favorite artists!  He is so talented.  Great live performer as well.  What possessed him to do this??|`|6LcHJbHjaa	I have no problem with rock (or alternative) rock taking a swing at hip-hop, like look at Beck, some of his albums like Odelay! feature great hip-hop like tunes.  But in Chris Cornell's case i think he still belongs in Soundgarden screaming, hip hop is obviously not his musical strength.<br>  <br>  It's sort of disappointing, i guess he's just trying to gain more popularity as a solo artist by mixing in new sounds, but i'm not the biggest fan of this <br>  decision.  I'd rank his rapping anywhere from mediocre to average.  The video was also pretty cheesy, one of the biggest cliches for music videos is riding in a car the whole time with a woman.<br>  <br>  <br>  Fonzie and i got the trolls, not hurting my confidence at all.|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Oh god dont even get me started. I watched like 20 seconds of that video and it damged me psycoligily.<br>  <br>  and i cant really ignore it because now whenever i try to watch a Pearl Jam video on YouTube or look up an Alice In Chains song lyric i get a big advertisement that is like "LISTEN TO CHRIS CORNELLS **** NEW SONG HERE YOU KNOW BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING UP ALICE IN CHAINS ARE JUST IN LOVE WITH TIMBERLAND AND ALL".|`|AA12135515	Ok. well, I'm thinking the guy hasn't decided to undergo a full "conversion".<br>  Also, that did Not sound like full-blown hip hop to my ears. More of a straight up pop song to me. (albeit a more serious, non dance-oriented one)<br>  <br>   I think he just wanted to  expand his palette a little. Nothing wrong with that & ultimately, it's the kinda thing that'll make him a more well-rounded musician.<br>  <br>  No one should lose their minds over this one song.|`|6EoAKcMwaa	Pocket Jokers,<br>  <br>  That song needs to come with a warning - potential brain cell loss related to listening to that noise! <br>  <br>  I lasted 1:15, I couldn't take any more! That was truly painful. <br>  <br>  Experimentation is a good thing, this not so much.<br>  <br>  All I can say is WTF!|`|2Hl4AAP7aa	it made me want to scream and whats with the hair? growing old gracefully is not something he has heard.what a waste of a great voice, WTF was he thinking or NOT|`|SMVsmzi4aa	Was that a fuckin joke?<br>  i lasted to about :41 than i just couldn't take it anymore<br>  i have no problem really with things like that. but him? no its just not his thing.|`|OId3Lfw0aa	I'm all for him doing whatever he wants to do creatively - but...<br>  I can't stand his new stuff, it's such a shame because I love his voice.<br>  Hopefully he gets back to rock soon!|`|rUFBXL3Uaa	It's awful

19YfKNpJaa	I can help you, but I need more information:<br>  <br>  1) For what instrument(s)?  "Percussion" is not very specific.  Are you looking for a piece for drum set, multiple percussion, timpani, marimba, vibraphone, xylophone, steel drum, tambourine, snare drum, etc?<br>  <br>  2) What level are you?  Are we looking for an advanced four-mallet marimba solo, or a two-drum timpani solo with no tuning changes?<br>  <br>  3) What kind of festival?  I ask because many festivals specify the music to be played -- if you're doing a NYSSMA (NY state school music assoc), they have a list of pieces that are acceptable, so you need to choose from that list.|`|dpYMlxA4aa	Easiest thing to do is go to your local library (or nearest university with a music library). If they use the Library of congress system Solo Percussion music will be in M146|`|Oqy3JFIHaa	Well I would recommend you to keep asking your teacher... Tell him/her this is very important. Usually for festivals there are songs that are eligible or not eligible so to be safe just keep asking. You can look at sheetmusic plus which is a great site. <br>  Teachers get so busy and caught up in the moment they forget right after you ask them.<br>  <br>  Best of luck getting your solo!|`|qZaNu8Hvaa	hey,<br>  check out around the 4:30 mark.....but the whole song is great<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X7TbjTY730&playnext_from=PL&feature=PlayList&p=9D09232193F34DA4&playnext=1&index=10" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X7TbjTY7...</a>

JFtpuPrkaa	This reply may end up being long, but the short answer is learn as much about storytelling as you can,  Take literature courses, study poetry, read as many movie reviews as you can stomach, and, of course, watch a lot of movies.  You have to learn to recognize things that are both subtle and obvious.<br>  <br>  The link Conava gave you is a great place to start.<br>  <br>  There is a lot going on in a good movie.  A good movie doesn't tell you things, it lets you discover things.  A good movie points things out, but in a subtle way.  And a good movie does this with style.<br>  <br>  First, you have to learn to recognize what a movie is about. The sheriff in "No Country For Old Men" (he's actually the central character) begins the movie as an amiable guy who knows everybody in town and is able to handle problems without ever carrying a gun.  This changes during the movie.  The violence is something the sheriff really doesn't relate to so retires because this is not the country he knows or remembers.  The larger theme here is that the older you get, the less you fit in with the times.  The movie lets you discover that through the eyes of the sheriff.<br>  <br>  A sub-theme to "No Country..." is fate.  The killer represents death.  We are all going to die, the only question is when.  If we die before our time, sometimes we deserve it, sometimes we don't, or sometimes it's just a random thing, like flipping a coin.<br>  <br>  The question here is that can you recognize those themes?  As a good critic you should be able see the themes and then judge if the movie makers did a good job presenting and analyzing those themes.<br>  That's why you have to learn as much as you can about storytelling.<br>  <br>  A second thing to look for is the acting.  How well do the actors portray the roles they were given.  As a critic, that's your judgment call.  Did you get a feel for the roles and did the actors correctly portray those roles?  For example, I think Edward Norton is a very good actor, but in his role in the "Illusionist" he came off as rather wooden and emotionless.  Do you agree or disagree, and why...and is this because of his acting, or the role he was given to play?<br>  <br>  Music is a very important part of movies.  As a movie critic you have to sometimes be a music critic.  Music oftens sets the mood of the movie, so the question is how well does the music fit. <br>  <br>  I'm getting a little long winded here so I'd best stop.  I learn best by example, and then by doing.  I think the best movie critic out there today is Roger Ebert.  I suggest that you watch a movie and then read Ebert's review of the movie.  Ebert can be your example.  Try to understand what he's saying and then watch the movie again to see if you agree or disagree with the points he makes.  Ebert does about 250 reviews a year and he's been at it for a long time so you have of examples.  Who knows, maybe the gods invented Video Rental Stores so you can become a film critic.|`|n583S1uZaa	This is a technical,professional query that in-turn deserves a like-response as far as I'm concerned.We know that folks everywhere proudly credit themselves as being film critics(in their own right).Just throw a rock in a crowd and you'll hit one! I know a few,and some folks say they think I'm a good film critic:I never turn down those gracious kudos(lol).However,realistically when you are talking a professional life ambition and making money in this craft,check with Pros or books on the subject.This link can get you started in the meantime.Good Luck!<br>  <a href="http://trumpy.cs.elon.edu/metaverse/gst364Win2005/howToCritiqueAMovie.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://trumpy.cs.elon.edu/metaverse/gst3...</a>

AA10985791	yes, years ago, I was on a programme with Ian Dempsey called 'talkabout'. I got roped into it to replace some other contestants that had bailed out. My boss's sister worked for RTE, so she came to my office and asked if anyone was free that evening to go to the studios.  I had never seen the programme before so had no idea what i was getting myself in for.  I honestly thought I'd be in the background, but no such luck, I was the main answerer of questions.   I didn't win, thank god. I got a dictionary as a consolation prize, which the producers asked for back once the cameras stopped rolling.

40kCOPicaa	Well, let me start by saying well done. You are in the right direction using the right operating system and (basically) the right software. As for courses you could get a job in film editing with a generic media qualification, video compositioning or more specifically; you can do degrees specifically in Film Editing and I know a friend who did that; they're usually 3-4 years long and there's a good balance between theory and practical. Believe it, or not, but there's a lot of conceptual work with editing. You have to hand draw conceptual pieces like storyboards and so on, but it's good fun! You'll get to use all the industry standard programs like Final Cut Pro, Premier Pro, Adobe After Effects and so on.<br>  <br>  It's a steep climb, but you seem very motivated and I wish you good luck.

Too good. And to stop the rest of his team looking bad, he is reassigned to the quiet town of Sandford. He is paired with Danny Butterman, who countlessly questions him on the action lifestyle. Everything seems quiet for Angel, until two actors are found decapitated. It is address to as an accident, but Angel isn't going to accept that, especially when more and more people turn up dead. Angel and Danny clash with everyone, whilst trying to uncover the truth behind the mystery of the apparent "acidents".<br>  <br>  Anchor Man ------ Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) is the top-rated anchorman in San Diego in the '70s. When feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone (Applegate), Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other "female" interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons... it's war. <br>  <br>  Step Brothers ------- Brennan Huff and Dale Doback are both about 40 when Brennan's mom and Dale's dad marry. The sons still live with the parents so they must now share a room. Initial antipathy threatens the household's peace and the parents' relationship.

c515a77725833baaf00c86cd0353807faa	I get such a kick out seeing people guess how many songs Elvis recorded or sang and guessing an unbelievibly lower amount than what it really is. It's understandable because most people have a large collection of songs after 50 years of singing. Elvis was only in the business for 20 years. The average person might would be lucky to have 100 songs by then, maybe 200...maybe. <br>  <br>  But I like your question, because Elvis recorded over 700 songs. I think it was about 725 or something like that. But you don't say "recorded" you say "sing". Elvis had to of sang over 1000 songs, maybe more. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if the count was 1500 or more.|`|x8zlur2zaa	Maybe 59 songs?

mFInMKSaaa	hey weirdo, what is grudge?  Nirvana was good, but I was into Alice.  I think it is all up to the individual, but as far as talent, fan base, and longevity of course, definitely Metallica.  I think, though Nirvana was good, they filled a niche and would have dried up over the years.  Metallica was something else.  If you think Metallica is just noise then you shouldn't even be thinking about touching your keyboard to answer this question.  Please leave now.|`|V1hxvQukaa	i think so. <br>  <br>  it's hard to compare though since they are two very different types of music. nirvana did start the grunge movement (i know they didn't invent grunge, but they made it popular). they had huge success in the 5ish years they were around. plus, kurt cobain was an AMAZING lyricist. both bands are legends in my opinion...|`|0y2HI527aa	Nirvana was MUCH BETTER than Matallica. Nirvana was so much more. at least in my opinion.|`|flU2gf54aa	Not even close. nirvana was talentless teenage crap|`|fc2LcdvVaa	They are both awesome but completely different kinds of music. 1 is Grunge/Alternative the other is Metal/Hard Rock kinda hard to put them together and compare. I love them both. and to say Nirvana has no talent look at Dave Grohl he has had what 3 or 4 very successful bands? and still rockin. Pretty good for talentless teenage crap. And  Kurt Cobain was one of the most talented singers/writers who died too soon. Who knows what he could have done in his lifetime.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Nirvana is just another adored Teenage band. Nirvana did not start grunge. In the time frame Nirvana was around for 7 years Metallica had released 3 master-piece albums one arguably an all time great Metal album being Master of Puppets the other 2 being Ride the Lighting and Kill em All. This is really no contest Metallica would totally wreck Nirvana.|`|AA10368887	In my opinion, Nirvana is infinitely better than Metallica. Metallica is simply "noise".
RXKGSNtqaa	Try the 'classics' - as in, manga with a little bit of fantasy and action in them:<br>  <br>  Black Cat<br>  D.Gray-Man<br>  Death Note<br>  Hellsing<br>  Shaman King<br>  Claymore<br>  MxO<br>  Fairytail<br>  Naruto<br>  Inuyasha<br>  Gintama<br>  Bleach<br>  Full Metal Alchemist<br>  Law of Ueki<br>  Samurai X<br>  <br>  And the not-so-classic ones (the ones you've probably never heard of!):<br>  <br>  Abara<br>  Silvery Crow<br>  Cristo<br>  Ageha|`|O2sPbNbZaa	Naruto<br>  D.Grayman<br>  Air Gear<br>  Inuyasha<br>  Blazer drive|`|o3JO2Tq8aa	Typically the standard shonen stuff, like Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece.  If you want something with action that is not one of the mainstream shonen mangas, I'd suggest Black Cat.  That one not only has fighting with standard weapons and gadgets, but also a few mystical powers too.<br>  <br>  If you don't mind a little blood/gore, then Hellsing is pretty good too.

RgniB1DLaa	Okay. Well, first, try and find a cheap place to hire out without your moms help. That will show your mom you are actually very responsible with money. Then, try and persuade her that it is going to be a responsible party and nothing will go wrong. Also, don't let her watch and Sweet Sixteens or she will get the wrong idea and think you will be like that.|`|mrA6yUTZaa	well if you party is in july why not ask her if you can do it in your backyard and obviosly ur bros and father want need to dress up.<br>  It's your transition from a child to a teen you need to have a party.<br>  you can quote me on that.:P<br>  ask her nicely and act kinder than normal...:D lol<br>  if that doesn't work try crying|`|wfYLEBK6aa	You could try to work out exactly what you need to do for the party and exactly how much it would cost. If you show your mum proof that the party will not be as expensive as she thinks it would be, then she wouldn't have much reason not to let you have it. :P. <br>  For things you are confused about, ask her. Your family would probably want to be a part of your 13th birthday celebrations, which is maybe why they were expecting to dress up. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. Don't forget that you can rent tuxes and stuff, which would take some of the cost out of clothing.|`|A78bcDn9aa	its easy and i feel your pain my mom never let me go to or thro b-partys just beg plead finally she will get sick of it and thro you one or do what i did and save up a bunch of money

I wouldn't put that past him because he's a bit of a womanizer and pretty stuck on himself.  I am confident that this will put Cane and Chloe back together when she realizes what Billy is really like, and Silly Lily will be out of the picture.  Anything to break Lily and Cane up at this point.|`|ClRuPRs7aa	I totally agree with you!! I have no idea why cane is so obsessed with it because he is the uncle and he is going to see the baby anyway. I know Chloe really hurt him, and he got attached to the baby but come onn! Custody for a kid that's not even yours?? What are you gonna tell her when she grows up? That's irresponsible and just stupid. I can't believe Lily agreed to look after Chloe's and Billy's child. I would never expect that from her. I hope Billy and Chloe get custody because it is their kid and they are responsible for her. And Billy just might be a good father.|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	i hope her mother and father, chloe and billy. i don't like cane or lily anymore after what they are trying to do -take the baby away from it's parents. babies should be with their mommies unless the mommy is unfit, like abusive, drug attic. etc.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	Thats the case desion|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	I want full custody to go to Billy & Chloe since they are the biological parents, I don't want Cane to even have visitation rights!. I cannot stand Cane now that he is saying he is going after full custody & how he wants to raise Cordelia with Lily! Chloe needs to have Cane charged with fraud for knowingly falsifying information on Cordelia's birth certificate. I think Cane needs to divorce Chloe, put the whole thing in the past, marry Lily & try to have a baby of their own.|`|vqUVWPBAaa	Cordelia belongs with William Foster Abbott and Katherine Valentine aka Chloe Mitchell Ashby soon to be Abbott. Because Billy is willing to step-up and do the the right thing.<br>  Cane is really being a jerk, I do not like this story line. Lily should know better, she was raised by Neil only because Malcolm would not step up and only demanded a paternity test when he came back from the dead. Lily was near adulthood when she found out. These long lost family members and are you my daddy story lines are so boring in daytime tv.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	Agree,,,,Cane and Little Lily need to go make their own baby !!!! God only knows the practice they've had !!!<br>   ,.,.,..>>> Chloe should get custody and Billy be involved <><br>   I think Chloe will be a good mommy and Billy a good daddy but suspect he wont be involved for long ( damn him )  <br>   I feel sorry for the disrespect both Cane & Billy have dished out to her and even more badly because the baby is the only reason Billy is even thinking about sticking around. <br>  <br>   BUT ... by the spoilers going around about Sleazy Sharon spreading her legs to anyone who will go there... and Little Lily ( possibly ) being pregnant . I'm thinking Cane,, Billy and Nick will  all be needing  DNA test ! <br>  <><><><>oh my,,,,the residents of Genoa City have gone nympho !|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	I think you guys need to give Cane a break. He did the right thing, stepped up the plate and got totally lied to by Chloe. Chloe is a psycho liar. Why does everyone like this type of character? She maliciously broke up Cane and Lily for her own ends. Billy is shallow and immature. He wants to "step up" but he is totally a dog. He just slept with Sharon with no protection. He didn't learn one thing from this Chloe mess. I agree that Cane is going overboard but his heart is broken. He fell in love with his child and now he has to lose her to Chloe the liar and Billy the bastard. I think Chloe needs to get her comeuppance for all her lies@|`|PxXsmrpyaa	I want Billy and Chloe to have Delia because she is their daughter.  They deserve to have a chance to raise her.  Chloe's had Delia for nine months and they can't just take her away from Chloe.|`|vO9fPCm2aa	Chloe of course, Cane and Lilly need to move on to other things like getting a life. :~)|`|msUIsv8maa	Chloe she;s the babies Mother|`|lGdzb8aqaa	Chloe and Billy.|`|qWzN3i3Uaa	I don't understand why Cane feels he can just take Cordelia away from her real parents. Cane, you thought the baby was yours and she's not so just get over it. How does figure he can take her and raise her with Lilly. I really hate Lilly and I would hate it if they gave Cordelia to them. Someone needs to tell Cane that its not very logical to give a baby to someone who is not her parent and she has a mother and a father who are totally willing to take care of her. Cane and Lilly need to go to an island and have little annoying babies of their own and stay there.|`|552a230b78bc5b4160481e32addc49e6aa	It really hard to take a baby away from their biological parents.  I think it's obvious Chloe and Billy will get custody.  Cane may get visitation due to Chloe's false promises and deception. I feel bad for Cane, but not bad enough for her not to have her baby.  I hope things work out for Chloe and Billy.  I have a feeling things will be changing and getting more complicated though..|`|r7sgshwKaa	I certainly hope Chloe and Billy get to keep their baby. I don't understand Cane "the neanderthal" anymore. I will absoulutely love to see him get shot down in the courtroom when it comes to this paternity hearing. He thinks he has everything all figured out but he just doesn't know that when you threaten a mother's baby its bound to be all gloves off. This test is kind of good for Chloe and Billy in a way because the threat is making them stand up and be real parents like they should be.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I would have to say Chloe and Billy, not only that they are but immature, but they are the baby's bio parents.  It seems that Cane is in denial and want to make a big stink about. So I am screaming out loud right now: "C'mon Cane, Lily was all you ever wanted, and now you have her back so just move on and the two of you will have children of your own."|`|BqHEeYA4aa	i think it should only go to chloe.<br>  billy is treating her like crap and not even really being the father. he was going to let cane take her.<br>  cane is just being an idiot. it seems like all his storylines revolve around him being stupid and making mistakes with women. the baby's not his and not like he was actually fathering her for any period of time to be attached. <br>  i think it would be best if maybe just chole and maybe esther (and maybe maybe jill) help out|`|WJW4qOlUaa	I hope Chloe gets full custody of her baby! That is her baby and she is doing a great job at being a mother (I really didnt think she would have been). Cane and Lily just need to back off and let Chloe raise her child.|`|M8yem2wUaa	I think Billy and Chloe are the ones getting full custody because they are really the parents, but they still need to get Cane and Lily some explaining to do.|`|pnl9Rkzcaa	Ya I want cordelia to be with Chloe and Billy And I want billy to step up and be with deila.<br>  Like Cane and Lily are reallyyyyy stupid<br>  thats not his kid<br>  =D|`|cce7d68825e6be23ab1dbad4e0df262faa	Chloe that's it I want billy to take a hike because he's just a big jerk and for Cane to start his life over with Lilly and make there own baby !|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I want Chloe to get custody. & Billy to step up.

cRmNLNxLaa	Well, if you are looking for some mature romance (not the slapstick comedy romance), definitely try out Honey and Clover. It's made by the same studio who did Nodame Cantabile but I think it's a little bit more serious. Watch it at <a href="http://www.hiddenanime.com/honey-and-clover" rel="nofollow">http://www.hiddenanime.com/honey-and-clo...</a><br>  <br>  Moyashimon is also set in the present day. It was produced by the same studio as Honey and Clover and Nodame Cantabile, so I thought it was pretty enjoyable. Watch it at <a href="http://www.hiddenanime.com/category/moyashimon/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hiddenanime.com/category/moya...</a><br>  <br>  Another good anime geared towards more mature audiences is Mushishi. Every episode of Mushishi has a little life lesson presented in a very interesting way. However be warned - watching many episodes of it in one sitting may end up a little boring.

LqwIufZVaa	yeah;<br>  i still LOVE them but i dont like the way that they are changing.<br>  i agree that they need room to grow as artist and are now becoming very popular in different parts of the world, and may be changing a bit to<br>  fill their likes and dislikes, or maybe they just sold out to an image and a record label[gosh, i hope not]<br>  but i think that who they were before made them different and appealing and intresting thats why i love them so much.<br>  <br>  i cant wait for their cd, i hope they still sound the same|`|c7GGP3Qlaa	I don't know.I don't know if anybody knows if his hair is dreads or if it's just braids but mostly everybody thinks it's just braids.But I LOVED his lion mane too!lol They might be changing a little bit but hopefully not TOO much.I think if they start changing they'll all get stuck up.I hope that never happens.I'm looking forward to their new CD too.If the sound changes a little bit I would really love that.I want it to be a little more along the lines of hard rock.And even if they are changing we have to remain their fans.They have so many haters they don't need any more.|`|aitD50yuaa	let the boy do what he wants with his hair jeez, I think he looks damn good no matter what, and I know Tom cut his dreads a tiny bit, But I'm not  complaining even though I love dread lock dudes, but they grow back faster in no time, But I think the white dread attachments look fine, He will always be hot, arent fans supposed to accept what they do, no matter what =)<br>  <br>  I can't wait for the new CD, I guess he just got tired of using so much hairspry and it's summer time, I'm sure that gets hot.|`|qLhtnommaa	Okay! It's Bill's hair! Not yours! Who cares what he does with his hair? And personally I think he looks fantastic! A true Tokio Hotel fan doesn't start slowly disliking them because of a little change. Honestly, I am having second thoughts about some of you supposedly "Hardcore" Tokio Hotel fans. Saying you don't like the change, well it kinda seems like you're posers to me.|`|yJQzjjkvaa	They tied with some other people<br>  <br>  TH isnt changing, its only Bills hair and its HIS hair, so he can do what he wants, for all we know its temporary. I think Bill would be cute even if he shaved his head, mainly because of his personality. But i hope when the album releases i am in Germany because it would be awesome to see all the TH fans!!!! and i would be able to get their German album. I am going to DEUTSCHLAND im JUNI!!!!!!!!!!!  sorry i am a bit excited|`|gew4KVFfaa	dont worry about the whole bill got dreads thing. his hairstylist said they are fake. maybe hes just letting his hair relax after all the one hairspray bottle a day thing. lol. and they are not changing that much! there still good old bill,tom, gerog,and gustav but with a new image for a new year. i still love them nomatter what. and i hope they won! but im not sure.<br>  hope this helps=)<br>  <br>  <33|`|IGPMqhjKaa	I dont think that they did, and by they way, im a huge fan, I dont like the way that they are changing but i dont truly dislike it either.

And her, her mom, and her sister Noah were all so sweet and down to earth. I thought I was meeting a girl my age who wasn't famous (despite all the lights and people surrounding us haha) Anyways I think she is a great role model, and she shows that she isn't perfect and she is human.

Shes fantasitc, like you said :)<br>  <br>  Miley rocks!|`|vyGyLV7paa	hate her.  she says that she is a normal teenager, but her amount of fans is more than the population of Zimbabwe.  she also has enough money to end poverty in New York, Chicago and Cameroon.   but she doesnt do anything but sing her ugly songs about boy problems that she doesnt have... there would be more but i don't want to type it.|`|Mrkchaemaa	i agree with julie r she is just this lil kid from nowhere who all of a sudden throws on a blond wig and starts singing (badly) about boys and other kiddy sh@t. shes making millions of dollars off impressionable minds and her and her father are a little too lovey dovey if you ask me|`|jKBQgwEqaa	im not jealous of miley i just dont like her its like if u met someone in ur class and u didn't like them would u want 2 b their friend??? i dont think shes the best person but u can like her and other ppl can 2 but if u ask me i dont like her|`|kNSGLgJQaa	shes gay and i think its funny how thom yorke said he didn't care too meet her<br>  good on him<br>  overrated overplayed little *****<br>  she is hot though|`|3uWCmNCsaa	Never met her, so I don't have an opinion.

(whenever they changed to Sky, I forget which season that was)|`|PSojABqMaa	no. why? because that show sucks. <br>  <br>  every commercial i watch, threatens the main characters life GASP!!!!

I started watching late on (series 5-6) and I kept missing bits and my family keep having to fill me in, which ruins it a little. I love 24 - is brilliant.|`|o9e0ApDraa	if your gonna watch 24 then its probably best to start at the start, if your gonna buy the dvds then by the time you need to buy day7 it should be quite cheap. we bought a boxset of 1-6 for about ￡50 on ebay. got a little board half way though the second season, but after that i got back into it(we did watch at least 4 episodes at a time tho)<br>   hope this helps|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	We got them on DVD from the beginning last summer and watched up to the current (then) point and have continued to watch. Yes, its worth it as you get background on various character that are in the series even now. From an enjoyment point too-its a good show and has been for years. I'm really glad I did. Its nice on DVD too-faster! We still Tivo the show and skip through the commercials! I think it will definitely be worth your time.|`|ZDjmDuuyaa	Go for it if you enjoy it why not another show you may enjoy is the wire very gritty awesome show check it out.

Eh0R7IjGaa	My absolute favourite piece is the Allegro Con Brio from Beethoven's 5th symphony. The Allegro Con Brio, which is the first movement of this symphony, begins with what is undoubtably the most famous musical phrase of all time: the four note duh duh duh duuuhhh, duh duh duh duuuhhhhh.<br>  <br>  Another great piece by Beethoven is his ninth and final symphony, especially the fourth movement, which has been described as a 'symphony within a symphony' because it is so grand. The famous 'ode to joy' is part of his ninth symphony.<br>  <br>  Another great Romantic composer is Tchaikovsky.<br>  One of his most famous pieces is the 1812 Overture, which as far as I know (not from first hand experience, but from people who have) is played every July 4th in America.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Romantic? Liszt and Chopin are your boys!|`|AA11237345	Lots of Ludwigs examples here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.songofthesalesman.co.uk/ad.aspx?partist=Beethoven" rel="nofollow">http://www.songofthesalesman.co.uk/ad.as...</a>|`|kbFty6eVaa	Apologies to everyone else, but the best music Beethoven ever wrote, without question, is his late string quartets.<br>  <br>  Schubert: "After this, what is there left for us to write?"<br>  Beethoven himself: "There is less lack of imagination than ever before."<br>  Wagner on #14: "The saddest sentiment ever expressed in music."<br>  Stravinsky on the last movement (Grosse Fuge) of #13: "It is a contemporary piece that will always be contemporary."|`|CjPtAEzmaa	Pretty much anything...my favorites (unfortunately, they are also some of the most famous, but IMHO they are famous for a reason):<br>  <br>  The people above were right when they said Moonlight Sonata. My favorite movement is the third: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqSulR9Fymg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqSulR9Fy...</a><br>  <br>  Also, the first movement of his Tempest Sonata: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTzA6Mg_i7A&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTzA6Mg_i...</a><br>  <br>  And the third:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfjD-DQ5REk&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfjD-DQ5R...</a><br>  <br>  Also, the first movement of his Pathetique Sonata:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4G3KRAuXc&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq4G3KRAu...</a><br>  <br>  Of course, we all know the first movement of his fifth symphony: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhcR1ZS2hVo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhcR1ZS2h...</a><br>  <br>  But you would also enjoy movements three and four!  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDar-ycF5fE&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDar-ycF5...</a><br>  <br>  Also, check out the fourth movement of his sixth symphony, which I can't find a YouTube link for. :(<br>  <br>  And, just 'cause I feel like it, I'm going to give you some non-Beethoven that has 'grand dramatic (but tonal!) heart-wrenching chords'.<br>  <br>  This Rachmaninoff prelude:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXU7I_Yyi2Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXU7I_Yyi...</a> (my favorite part is at :45)<br>  <br>  Chopin's 'Winter Wind' etude (don't let the beginning fool you, it explodes at 23 seconds!):<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1_dPyBR_eY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1_dPyBR_...</a><br>  <br>  And 'Scotch Poem' by Edward MacDowell:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClqdWEiL1IA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClqdWEiL1...</a><br>  <br>  Finally, 'Melodie' by Edward Grieg:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFeDtaTPMf8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFeDtaTPM...</a><br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|dd15228a42b4652d8768334912349b61aa	I also love the Moonlight ~ but one I always enjoy is his 9th Symphony,  a very dramatic piece.|`|zEoRcL91aa	Try piano concerto number 5 and the Fantasia. He wrote many short and famous romantic pieces like Moonlight Sonata, Andante Favorit, Für Elise.<br>  <br>  If you like romantic piano music I also suggest Mendelssohn's Musik ohne Worte (music without words), Chopin's Mazurkas, Impromptus, etc.<br>  <br>  For symphony: Schubert's 5th, Beethoven's 6th - always makes me happy.|`|MU4JbC3gaa	Try to listen to all movements of pieces that you hear. Each movement has its own unique mood and they all fit together.<br>  <br>  Sonatas:<br>  1)Pathetique<br>  2)Tempest<br>  3)Apassionata (one of the best)<br>  4)Moonlight<br>  5)Hammerklavier<br>  <br>  6)Spring sonata (for the violin)<br>  ......................<br>  Ruins of Athens<br>  Piano concerto no. 3<br>  <br>  Symphonies<br>  nos. <br>  2,3,5,6,9|`|4d823a9a4d0ab9c08c434ed5ed23a2e1aa	Forget the piano.<br>  Try either Symphony Number 7<br>  or Missa Solemnis.|`|AA10206525	I LOVE the Moonlight Sonata or his Piano Sonata in c minor,the first movement|`|9PaRdlwcaa	Moonlight Sonata is my favorite :)|`|FeKhc3vRaa	I love Moonlight Sonata!!!|`|4214bf7582b128803ab1a8a0abb3daf6aa	Hard to say, there is so much.

bsnnEsp5aa	>> Its isn't bloody at all, but it is very dark in parts, the story is generally quite dark and moody, with no comedy. <br>  >> I think you should stay away from it if Princess Mononoke frightened you, however, it is an excellent anime. It is about warriors and things, but there are fight scenes, very dramatic fightscenes in parts. So I guess ultimately its down to you. But I think you should maybe give it a try and if it get's too violent for you, you can always drop it and pick up something else XP|`|APP0eC03aa	it was ages ago since i last saw it but when i think back i dont remember it being bloody or anything.|`|SvVbZfjQaa	as far as remember its not bloody but some killing is there.

She has been living in a tent by herself because her mother ,who was the only living parent she had, recently died in a car accident. She decided to live with her grandfather on her Dad's side but the house they wished to live in was being remodeled, so the girl (Tohru) had to find somewhere else to live in for a while. After school (back to the day she met the two cousins) a rock slide hit the tent and destroyed it. Tohru also got sick that day and so one of the cousins took care of her while the other decided to see if he could get any of Tohru's possessions that might have been unharmed from the rock slide. The two cousins then offer her to live with them for a while until her grandfather's house is down with the remodeling and have her pay rent by being the "housekeeper". After a while another one of their cousin appears and Tohru learns about their family secret.  The story laters goes on how Tohru meets the rest of the family and attempts to break the curse.<br>  <br>  About manga and anime releases:<br>  There are a total of 23 manga books. 22 have been released already in English in the U.S and one is being released this month I think. The anime is worth watching though so you can compare the two. Hopefully that helped you some.
EvxVrGPQaa	It's the same as with Harry Potter. A whole lot of people have read the book and are curious about the movie. Together with a very young cast of actors that a lot of people already know from previous movies. And there you go..|`|2ADABqY5aa	Everyone is so obsessed with Twilight because vampires and romance are the 'in' for this decade things, and the simple fact that a saga of books and the movies contain both vampires and romance is enough to make people think "Oh, wow- that's never been done before! It's, like, so totally amazing!" when in fact it isn't. Give it about another four or five years, and people will start obsessing over werewolves.<br>  Besides, the guy who plays Edward is supposed to be really cute, but I don't think he is- I reckon he looks like someone just started to randomly hack chunks out of a brick of clay.|`|7vPRN4Rraa	If you read the books you would understand.

But it was my first instinct that Taylor was, is, and should be Jacob, and that the books would be best served by the actor who is emotionally right for the part. I think that fans of Twilight the book and the movie will be surprised by the Jacob Black that Taylor will bring to the screen in New Moon; and I'm looking forward to working with him and the rest of the cast in realizing the film.<br>  <br>  very best<br>  <br>  Chris Weitz'<br>  <br>  I'd just like to add that I was very much a part of this decision. My first priority was always what was best for New Moon—what was going to give us the best possible movie. I'm truly thrilled that Taylor was the one who proved to the director, to Summit, and to me that he is the best possible Jacob we could have. And I'm very much looking forward to seeing what he's going to bring to Jacob's character this year.<br>  <br>  -Steph"<br>  <br>  So they've obviously chosen Taylor Lautner to again play Jacob Black. Good choice!|`|Yh7GOkZHaa	Dakota Fanning is defintely playing Jane<br>  Taylor is going to play Jacob <br>  and im pretty sure all the Cullens and Bella are going to be the same actors.|`|55np4yGuaa	not sure, but check out this contest for a chance to appear in the movie.<br>  <a href="http://twilightthemovie.com/?roi=echo4-5030062713-4271657-a58778f342af12f48845f26372fa4074&" rel="nofollow">http://twilightthemovie.com/?roi=echo4-5...</a>|`|Z3G87w1daa	yes same acctresses but jacob maybe different<br>  and they are casting know|`|HnXeMwJcaa	i dont know if they ever will lol|`|paP4Sl1Baa	They have but they haven't released any information about the cast, except Dakota Fanning is FOR SURE going to play the role of Jane.

If you're thinking about throwing a Twilight viewing party, the weekend of the 20th would be a safe bet.
pyHF4eYJaa	Well, first of all you may be wrong. Astrology might not be BS. But even if it is BS, it still has a point. What is the social, cultural, or psychological purpose of astrology? What purpose does is it serve for people other than the stated purposes?|`|7rrNvFK7aa	Astrology can be pointless depending on the person doing the reading. If the person is good at astrology and they are able to offer guideline that may work, why consider them pointless ?<br>  Try them and if nothing comes of it, then I totally agree. They are ointless. Just because a person says that such and such thing is bad doesn't mean it is just because he or she doesn't like it.<br>  make your own conlcusions abut at least, try it and then comment.|`|FLeHvtcAaa	Because people who read that stuff seem to want to think there's an almighty explanation for why **** happens to them all the time.  Basically their life sucks and they need to know why, in my opinion.|`|CBmizuGwaa	...It's like watching "Willey Coyote" trying to catch the Roadrunner...   (look closely at any printed material associated with astrology... it says: "for entertainments purposes only")|`|gZQN3c7naa	yaa... astrology is really pointless as every person has own opinion<br>  eg. some one who is poor and the astrologer says money's rain is there so the poor will not float in money na...????<br>  soo|`|cku5S9WLaa	If you think its bull, don't waste your time. I'm sure there are plenty of other things you could be doing rather than complaining. No one is forcing you into anything.|`|6NZeItMAaa	I don't beleive in daily horoscopes but I beleive that our astrological sign has a big influence on our characters.<br>  <br>  after a little practice the careful observer can calculate with almost un-erring fidelity the domains of his friends and acquaintances by their general con-duct and habits. The people who be-long in the fiery triplicity, for instance, are as different from those who belong in the watery triplicity as fire is different from water; the air people are entirely unlike the earth folks, and so on.<br>  <br>  When a marked difference really exists between two persons born the same day, the intelligent observer and student will im-mediately set about comparing the environ-ments, always remembering that education is a most potent force in the evolution of the race. Take the hard-working washer-woman, for instance, whose life from birth has been a struggle for the bare necessities of life, and the educated and protected wife and mother, who were born under the same sign. They may not appear to have any traits in common, but if the mat-ter is looked into they will be found alike in   fundamental   characteristics.   <br>  <br>    Take those, again, who are on the same plane of social and intellectual life. One may show the selfishness or the quick temper that belongs to her sign; the other may appear quite thoughtless of self and as gentle as a summer breeze. The last has probably conquered the disagreeable and hinder-ing qualities, while the former has allowed them to conquer her.<br>  <br>  If radical differences do really obtain, they can be explained by the govern-ing planets; but these differences, com-paratively speaking, are few.|`|6Au5FIYWaa	You must learn what astrology truly is before you cast a judgement on it.|`|531f08d2bae7afb19dbace61520eb62caa	Astrology is based on a bigoted belief that we are programed like a computer the day we are born. No one has control of this and there is no evidence that it is true. This also make it a form of bigotry akin to racism and sexism. Take away the natural stereotyping that is astrology and the concept falls apart.<br>  <br>  Free will makes astrology completely pointless.<br>  <br>  If it's not science, it's superstition.|`|32P3hG0Laa	You mean just because YOU believe something, you don't understand why everyone doesn't agree with you? Wow. You have a great career ahead of you in diplomacy. <br>  <br>  Why do people listen to anything? Because it makes sense to them. I've been a professional astrologer for 20+ years. I had read many complete astrological birth charts for many clients and I have managed to help them get a handle on their lives, make decisions about what to do, weather difficult periods and relax and enjoy good times.<br>  <br>  I agree, the horoscopes you read in the newspapers & magazines & online are garbage. But getting a complete personalized astrological chart reading, using your personal birth day, year, time and place is a different thing altogether.<br>  <br>  I understand you may have come to the conclusions you have because you know so little about what astrology actually is. Try not to condemn things without examining them. It will serve you well in life.|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	It's brainwashing....<br>  naH, but i need a better understanding of it...|`|SlhdAZzpaa	its just guide..

S4VVE0onaa	best thing is to use wikipedia it explains it all|`|4b20f1516c0014a204a6974df7d09a78aa	Hi<br>  I remember having this video on the cd single.  To me it was about how to the outside she was this perfect happy person, but once she was through the door she was arguing with her other half.  It was full of emotion and the bath sceene was a little like giving up, and then all the drama surrounding her being ruched to hospital and all the paparazzi around her.  There was all this drama trying to save her and everything else, but in between was her in the white shirt totally calm and relaxed watching.  Like she was letting go.  It always seemed a very defeated song, and like she was giving up and not wanting to put up the front to the paparazzi anymore.  A dear friend of mine committed suicide around this song was released, and for some reason the song stuck in my mind.<br>  Good luck!|`|DftC5DQ1aa	Here you go! Good luck ;). I broke it down into the song and the video, use whichever you want.<br>  <br>  THE SONG: This it is about a girl who wants it all to work out - she wants everyone to like her, but realizes the world isn't fair. Not everyone is going to like you, and even though someone might make you mad, he could be the true one to you. It's more then she can handle, she is so sorry for everything she might put the guy through and she is "sorry if her weakness caused pain." (Britney's just been through the Justin Timberlake situation.... )<br>  <br>  <br>  THE VIDEO (sorry it's a long post):<br>  <br>  Britney and her boyfriend are traveling in the limo to the Las Vegas hotel where they are going to stay. Britney tries to get his attention in the car but he's stressed and there's clearly a lot of tension between them already. As they get out they're swamped by the paparazzi. Britney battles her way through with her body guards, almost losing her balance and screaming out in pain at one point (it seems as though some of the photographers are trying to tear her hat from her head to get better pictures as she's covering her face... in the struggle her head gets hit by a camera, but you have to be quick to notice it), whilst her boyfriend looses his temper and lashes out at the photographers, hurling magazines (significantly, with Britney on the cover and intrusive tabloid stories about the couple) at them and fighting his way through - and the photographers capture his outburst. As they enter the hotel, they're both still clearly shaken and Britney screams at her boyfriend for his outburst, whilst he storms about kicking boxes and knocking things over. In the hotel room, he goes to hug her to calm her down but she's still so angry with him and pushes him away. Frusterated, he lashes out again and slams a vase against the wall - and Britney has to shield her face from the shattered glass! She goes off into the bathroom and hurls a glass of water at her reflection in the mirror. As she gets into the bath, she notices that her head is bleeding from the back (this injury could have been caused in the scuffle with photographers or by the smashed vase that narrowly missed face). As blood pours, she looses consciousness and slips under water.... Then she has an out-of-body experience and her spirit is seen running down a white corridor towards 'the light', almost like she's given up on herself and wants to release of death. She also sees doctors battling to save her life - and later sees them giving up as she dies... However, in the same hospital, she watches over a woman who is giving birth to another baby girl. Scenes switch back-and-forth telling the whole tragic story, as we see her boyfriend desperately trying to revive his love's lifeless body - and we see the shamelessness of the ruthless photographers and autograph hunters trying to capture Britney's dying moments as she's carried off into an ambulance. In the end, we see the woman proudly watching over her new baby girl. Years later, we see Britney waking up in the bathtub smiling. She's been reincarnated as the baby girl and is happy. Her life is peaceful and she's happy with her new life. Although it's a tragic story, one way or another Britney lives again; and it's a happy ending that took a tragedy to get there. I love the story and the concept. It's a very unique way of looking at things, the tragedy that ended happily as Britney's spirit is now living a life she's completely at ease with. It's a beautiful sentiment...

Cucumbers trump sweet pickles.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ....Infact, everything trumps sweet pickles.|`|2bfde9659efa5b0ae5d12aab6a92051eaa	Cucumbers are better because it's fresh and new.|`|ENbpJigmaa	pickles are way better! Cucumbers have no taste|`|xk845oILaa	i like cucumbers more!|`|AbB3zdYwaa	CUCUMBERS!!<br>  <br>  But it depends on wether you bought them or grown them.<br>  <br>  When me and my mom started a garden with squash. tomatos (were eaten by little blind devils called moles, but my grandma got three big bushles), cucumbers, peppers ( didn't grow, but my grandma has a green thumd for peppers), peas ( didn't grow), strawberries ( didn't grow), watermelon (didn't grow, but my grandma got a lot of them= perfect summer!) and etc. <br>  <br>  Any way, when the first cucumbers cam up, my family noticed that it taste sweeter than the store bought.<br>  <br>  Plus, cucumbers make make your skin soft.<br>  :)|`|1ls1RVXGaa	cucumbers hands down... they're way funnier...i can think of three good jokes with cucumbers; pickles, only one.|`|uuK5lYsjaa	um depends on what you plan on using them for.|`|LhEoVly0aa	i like both but it depends what you are having them with lol.
B4ORpmS9aa	X-Men:God saves,Man kills<br>  <br>  Great PIc of you too.|`|lzDPzDjoaa	It depends on what you mean by graphic novels . . .<br>  I buy a ton, but they're ALL Japanese-style manga, which are those backwards comic books that count as graphic novels in some bookstores and libraries.<br>  If that's something that you would like to try reading, some of my recommendations (I'm a 14-year-old-girl) would be these:<br>  Azumanga Daioh<br>  Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch<br>  Yotsuba&!<br>  Kitchen Princess<br>  Translucent<br>  Tokyo mew Mew<br>  A Little snow fairy Sugar<br>  Fate/Stay Night<br>  Death Note . . .<br>  And just about any other manga that looks good to you<br>  If manga wasn't what you were talking about, sorry!  I just wanted to help and give some recommendations!  ^__^  Good luck finding something you will enjoy, and Happy Reading!|`|SSXxbmiFaa	I'm 14 and I really liked Johnny the Homicidal Maniac and Squee, but they are not really like the other ones you mentioned.

She's nuts.|`|hepo1ICcaa	what more can she say about cayley? shes obsessed with haley because she wants to see a conclusion to this whole ordeal. also with the family because they changed their story and choose to support their daughter who most people think killed their granddaughter. the parents seemed to indicate they knew haley did something wrong in the beginning but are now standing by her|`|6In638rbaa	It's starting to irritate me, someone needs to put her in check.|`|KFSGsB52aa	yeah i agree. i love her but i was thinking the same thing everyday its casey and i was like they solved it. OMG!
6In638rbaa	Although we do not know the specifics of what is going on. I do believe that she should have shown women all over the world that it's ok to leave an abusive relationship. You can come out of it stronger and more stable but I guess Rihanna has her own issues to deal with.|`|UKPYoPKuaa	Yes, because its so soon. He would have to bend over backward & go to anger managment before I'd even see him again. No matter how much you love a guy you have to have dignity.|`|hoGpOrOUaa	I agree with you and what's so sad about this whole situation is that alot of people are still supporting CB. They are justifying his actions and refusing to believe what happened, despite that awful picture shown of Rihanna and the police report which gave a detailed and horrific discription of how Chris beat her up. <br>  <br>  What people need to remember is that there is a cycle with woman beaters.<br>  If a child has been exposed to domestic violence, sadly, they are more likely to be woman beaters themselves and Chris WAS exposed to domestic violence.<br>  <br>  -Another bad sign is when the woman isolates herself from family and friends.<br>  I'm not sure about friends, but i do know that Rihannas family are not able to get contact with her and she has apparently changed her email.<br>  That was a dumb thing for her to do, because now if it happened again... who will she turn too?<br>  <br>  I also believe that this isn't the first time this has happened. It has been reported by Rihannas friends that they've seen bruises on her before.|`|FiGN6iVxaa	chris brown and rihanna are a mach made in heaven they are so cute toghther and most importantly they are in lovee...they even have maching tatooss....i know that if rihanna is ready to marry him its fine  because u dnt know chris brown i dnt know hiim none of us do annd she does so if she decides to marry him its becasue she knows he is not like that and that  hee is really uper sweet ...she loves himm anf he loves herr..isnt that enough??|`|kfSIl93gaa	I don't know about being stupid, but it is very unwise.<br>  <br>  Chris Brown has shown no remorse because obviously, Rihanna hasn't given him a reason to be sorry.<br>  <br>  It seems as if Chris Brown is thinking he's all that and a bag of chips.<br>  <br>  And since Rihanna has gone back with him so quickly, mark my words, it will happen again.<br>  <br>  Because a man who loves a woman never abuses her.  Ever.|`|KFSGsB52aa	yes she is stupid! she can get someone better whys she going back to his ***?

AA10560773	I personally don't see anything wrong with it. I am pro-CHOICE.|`|K0iFV73Gaa	Don't hate this is just my blief so I'll be honest with you. I believe through my religion that life starts at the moment of conseption. Therefor saying hat a woman is killing her own child. I also belied hat it's wrong because their are families out their that would love to have that child and the woman didn't even give the child a chance at life. You have your beliefs and I respect those these are just mine.|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	It's not right! That your taking away a life of a bby that could of been born, but than again some people have to do what they have to do......|`|luwBPdE8aa	It's not right to kill people over it, but what's wrong with not getting pregnant if you don't want a baby?|`|ZkDjl5I8aa	I don't see a problem with it.<br>  Having a baby could interfere with their job or they might be too young.<br>  Why let it be born, to put it into adoption or to have problems with their family because their mother is too young?<br>  Abortion is people's choice.<br>  They say 'your basically killing someone!'<br>  Well, they obviously have a reason to 'kill' the baby, shouldn't those people be crying over people who got killed for no reason at all?<br>  <br>  EDIT: For the people who are saying 'how would you like it if your mother aborted you?' For a start, he wouldn't even know he was aborted, mainly cause HE WOULDN'T BE HERE. Second, if they can understand whats going on, that doesn't make a difference. He/she is inside the mothers womb and we won't know their thoughts wether we like it or not.<br>  As I said, the people who abort have good reasons. All of you people saying abortion is bad, you are willing to let a child be born into a young, irresponsible family, or to be put into adoption and won't know their parents.<br>  I think that letting a child NOT be aborted if the mother is young, or will interfere with their job, or just isn't ready, is completely irresponsible and sicker than aborting.|`|QuokZhuqaa	Because it's horrible. It's like your killing someone without getting in trouble. You could of had a child but you chose to kill it. I could get if someone had to get rid of their baby because of rape but to just get rid of it because were not to responsible!?!?!??! It makes me mad. Abortion shouldn't even be a choice unless if it was for rape. There's other options.|`|oWLO6SiKaa	People (not me) think of it as murder because you are putting an end to a potential life. I however, think that is pretty stupid. You could argue that you are putting an end to many lives every time you dont get pregnant and your period (or potential fetus juice) goes down the drain.|`|UTZ2Lor4aa	I see it as legal murder, i mean think of i this way, the child didn't ask to be created and yet it's still being killed.<br>  <br>  But i wouldn't argue over it, everyone has their own veiws on it, and i value people's opinions.|`|yuiXfQqbaa	because its killing a child that is about to be born. how would you like it if u were about to be born and someone aborted u? its not nice. how do u know that this foetus or embryo cant feel anything?|`|oWHplAzwaa	What's right about it?|`|kGkUG0fKaa	Do me a favor, do a Benjamin Button for me! Go deage yourself then stuff yourself back up your mom' twat but keep in mind that you will remember your life when you were, you know already born, then wind back to about 3 months in the womb, look at your body, your hands, feet, how you are developing. listen to your own heart beat, then..wait....just wait. <br>  <br>  <br>  All of sudden, you're being forced out and all that life you felt is leaving you. it's weird, you can't hear your heartbeat anymore........<br>  <br>  So whats wrong with that?<br>  <br>  have you heard of partial birth abortions? That one is murder no matter how look at it, look it up then tell me whats right about that?<br>  <br>  in all I am PROCHOICE but it isn't my choice! DO WHAT YOU WILL WITH YOUR BODY!|`|EAuMJrs4aa	nothing as long as its not for gratuatous reasons, if theres a good reason then abortion is fine some people seem to do it for the sake of it<br>  <br>  and urm ya know i should have a say if its my child should i not?

oSXgtqYCaa	Hi! One of my classmates at music school did the following:<br>  <br>  1) he worked hard on his scales every day, and<br>  <br>  2) he spent a half hour every day forcing himself to read through a few pages of music without stopping...and he used a metrenome. At first he had to go slowly, but as he learned to read better, he was able to play more notes and faster. The key is to look at the key and time signatures first, then begin to play without stopping, even if it's slow. <br>  <br>  Take some music that is a little easier than what you normally work on, and practice sight-reading every day for a little bit. Try not to look at your hands while reading. Just keep going no matter how many notes you miss. If you want, you can go back and try a second time at the end. You will improve!|`|72a29394374017ab0f3283babed0be66aa	It just takes lots of practice. It is very worthwhile to learn. Some say it is harmful to know how to read. That's a big pile of nonsense.|`|sc4BtGxGaa	Please check the completed questions - I have responded to this numerous times, and I think I got BA for at least one of them.|`|AA12376180	You want to get better so you can perform for a ceratin someone? Hmmm ..... What's her name?<br>  <br>  Kindclarinetist gave some good advice. Let me add, before attempting to sight read anything, look at the music first. You must understand everything on the page. You wil not have time to figure out what note that is with all of those ledger lines. Figure out all those questionable areas before beginning.

AA11359184	I guess u haven't seen many otherwise u won't ask.  The creativity is to steal someone's work, twist according to Indian taste and still call it original at the awards ceremony.<br>  Gajni = Memento<br>  Kaante = Heat + Reservoir Dogs<br>  Sate pe Sata = Seven Brides and Seven Grooms<br>  Musafir = U-turn<br>  Zinda = The Boy<br>  and even the songs, dialogues and sets are copied.  <br>  <br>  Now now, not that Bollywood is like this. All the other *ollywoods around the world keep on copying each other's work. Even among themselves, shamelessly.  But it's fun nonetheless.|`|aaEcboFSaa	Well because some Hollywood movies are so good that they should be shown to other countries. <br>  But in a way that is fitting to the Indian Culture... <br>  It's flattering actually. =]<br>   =]|`|rkIzOGXYaa	well, i agree.many of the bollywood movies are so identical to their hollywood counterparts that legal case can be filed up(people at hollywood don't bother abt it though).<br>  <br>  i guess the reason is that the only thing Indian filmmakers can think of is the vilain carrying away the actress and then actor doing the rest of whats very obvious!..so when they need a new story , either it has to be from a book or hollywood.|`|YfgZV4I9aa	No. of unbeaten romantic indian films available.

1UOIoOzKaa	They dress like that cause they think they look good. And I think some of them are really pretty! And yeah they often look the same but so do Chavs and stuff. All we live for now is trends! So I guess just leave them be =]|`|QAQHJFI9aa	AND they think they invented every freaking thing. I was watching some video of interviews at Warped Tour about what people wore there, and some scene-looking chick claimed that she invented the headband across the forehead thing. I was like, "as if every other teenager hasn't done that before." <br>  <br>  They think they're so hot because people think scene style is awesome and unique and cool, but it's just a fleeting trend and it'll end in a while. I dislike it because it's too unnatural; yes some scene kids can look unique with their hair or makeup, but they put in so much effort into it that it's just tiresome. I prefer an effortless uniqueness. I agree that they all look the same, but don't we all?|`|OJXfV529aa	They think theyre unique, but theyre really not. Because EVERYONE is now trying to go scene.<br>  Its ridiculous and I agree with you, im sick of it.|`|iuwLHT2Taa	Let them do whatever they wanna do, grandma|`|kVxharmraa	I hope u dont take this the wrong way but every person fits into a certain group: Preppy, emo, scene, unquie, nerdy etc. Even though someone is unquie he/she still fits into a catogory. I personally dont care about if other ppl think they are hot or whatever because its not my bizness and if I were u i would just worry about your self. I have one question for you. By scene's thinking they are hot does that affect you in any way? Honestly if it affects u maybe u are paying to much attention to those type of ppl. hope i helped.

ETqZU5D9aa	Nothing wrong with that. My sister watches anime and she's awesome! lol, that's just like assuming only boys should play video games. I mean, I don't look like a gamer but I love them anyway. Just do what you like and stop worrying bout what other people think :D|`|O2sPbNbZaa	In no way whatsoever is it weird for girls to watch and like anime. A lot of the anime haters who would make fun of you for that have probably never watched it themselves (except for maybe sailor moon or something when they were little). What would you consider to be the anime type of girl? Really, anyone can watch whatever kind of show they want.|`|qCDT4zacaa	Oh, not at all. I'm always being told that i'm very attractive, & I take care of myself just as any girl should. I'm also a major anime addict, & a game freak.

Many of the regs on here are girls, and I know a ton of girls who watch anime.|`|BVf2eAWnaa	No, I don't think that is weird at all, but then again I am already watching anime :)|`|xyqHa5UEaa	no  its not...we girls can do anything we want lol<br>  <br>  lol yea i watch naruto shippuden until it started to get gay|`|P6xuhlgTaa	This questions have lot of sense especially looking the occidental way of thinking. people usually think mangas and animes which usually are called like this cause they are animations of mangas are for youngsters and for boys.<br>  But thats mostly wrong when you look more in oriental culture<br>  2 mangakas(authors) on 3 are women and girls have always been the first marketing target when a storyline is made for manga and animés whatever his genre. That's cause they are the firsts to buy them, subscribe for manga magazine and even vote for their preferences. <br>  <br>  Jump(a shonen magazine),others magazines statistic and mangas sold copys show it quite well<br>  Girls used to buy 90 to 95% of shojos and joseis and even 60% of shonens mangas.Also there is lot more shojos/joseis than shonen seinen and a shojo will sell lot more copies in general. Boys rarely go have a look in specific girls manga genre while girls used to love boyish genre mangas.Thats why you ll find bishonens(cute youngs boys character) even in shonens<br>  A mangaka that write a shonen without thinking about girls have no ways to suceed when votes are coming, meaning his serialisation can be stopped and he reduce his chance to turn his story into an animé.<br>  <br>  Mangas are very differents than comics and you have all possibles genres involved and some are very specific for girls and even adults women like joseis(for women in active life so 25+ years).<br>  Inuyasha is clearly for girls dealing with fantasy, aventure,light shojo and light shonen genres mixed. <br>  Have a look to extremist genres to see the difference of cultural thinking ; An occidental will think yaois/shonen ai are for gays when they can't be a realistic valuable cash target in numbers and these mangas are in fact exclusively bought by school girls and drawns by mature women^^: 2 boys in love is double chance to have one of the 2 thats is your genre and you can't see the possible girl of the story as a competitor<br>  <br>  If you want to learn more in an entertaining and fun way about manga and animé world, have a look about "Bakuman" the new manga of Death Note's mangaka.You can find it on most of online manga sites. Its about 2 boys trying to get edit in Jump, the first magazine for boys mangas, with a shonen and learnings about this world with their errors <br>  They lost junior competition and didn't get serialised cause they did an intelligent/battle manga without thinking about girls. <br>  They just lose the biggest population to vote, subscribe and buy this boy magazine .they only get  3rd with one of the best story just cause of this and find themselves reject by the magazine^^<br>  <br>  In final it's weirder for a boy to spend money in a manga or a dvd animé than for a girl looking worldwide editors statistics except in Us where comic education, authors stories and heroes types have trick a little the way to see this stories supports.Europeans girls have already take the lead upon boys since 2005 in cash spent and now the shojos zone is larger than the shonen one in stores. Youngster monthly cash isn't extensible and boys prefer spent it more in games and hi tech products.<br>  But that will change with time and your daughter will force you to buy her the future new "Fruit basket"|`|lug14gZZaa	there is nothing weird about it. I really dont look like a manga/anime person but i read manga and watch anime (probably my fav is fruits basket and Kiki's Delivery Service =]) my bestie friend is in love with anime and stuff but she really doesnt care if people make fun of her. lik you i also think stuff lik that (sometimes. ok most of the time) but also like some other people i dont go walking around in a cosplay and i dont care mangas everywhere i go (unless its school and i am really bored in class). so ya you shouldnt be ashamed of what people think|`|RXKGSNtqaa	I don't see any problem with it. I mean, I'm a die-hard anime fan myself, but I don't walk around looking like some freak cosplay and I don't carry manga/anime DVDs with me wherever I go. It's the whole stereotype of girls who like anime - they're either 'losers' or 'nerds'.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it, there's absolutely nothing wrong with liking anime. At least you've got one more interest the world does not appreciate.<br>  <br>  Honestly, what's so bad about anime anyway? People tend to associate people who like them with perverts and weird asian guys game 24/7, do all sorts of weird programming, and have no life. And having a girl liking anime is unthinkable. America should really change its viewpoints. And come to think of it, the whole world should stop looking down on anime.|`|N5Xc8WNraa	What is the anime "type" of girl? <br>  <br>  I watch anime alll the time, I live and breath anime.<br>  <br>  Bleach rocks, I love watching/reading that.<br>  <br>  Plus, I watch waaaaaay worse stuff, the my bro refers to as "boy" anime, which is completely stupid.<br>  <br>  Naruto got stupid, not gay. Nothing wrong with being gay. Sorry I hate when people use that word like that.|`|o3JO2Tq8aa	It's not weird at all.  Everyone has their hobbies and things they collect and enjoy.  <br>  <br>  There are many people that like anime, but do not necessarily look like a "standard anime fan".  I'm a good example.  :)|`|IjgkyIvhaa	3x3 Eyes :<br>  <a href="http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/1145.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/1145.html</a><br>  <br>  Ranma 1/2:<br>  <a href="http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/4887.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ttcomic.com/manga/4887.html</a>|`|SvVbZfjQaa	Of course not!!! most of the animes are better than cartoons. also u get flexibility in the plot with lots of different genres. also it is better than watching drama soaps|`|m40Hh4a1aa	that sounds totally like me-.- hahahhaaa<br>  its SOOOOOOOOOOOOO not weird.|`|KyOP56Xsaa	heyy, <br>  <br>  no, not weird at all and if people say you are tell them its none of their beezwax and you enjoy it,i mean its much more interesting than soaps. <br>  I'm a girl too and i like anime, no-one's ever made fun of me cos of that and if they do it just means they have bad taste and unique not weird. <br>  So carry on watching your anime, there's nothing wron at all, . =]<br>  <br>  After all there's quite a lot of people who watches anime and i'm not only talking about Japan. <br>  ~x~|`|PDJjy0bPaa	No it's not weird<br>  <br>  I watch Naruto and the Shippuden episodes (yeh it did get pretty lame).  But I'm not the stereotypical kind of anime watcher.  I couldn't tell you that such-and-such happened in episode 174 or something like that lol.  I just watch the show because it's good.|`|AA11111233	Not weird at all.  Some of the more famous anime shows, like Sailor Moon, are actually geared towards girls.  I don't think it's on anymore, buit if you type in Sailor Moon on YouTube, I'm sure you can find tons of stuff.  Also, I see tons of questions on here from likely girls, asking about romantic anime movies, so I'm sure you can check that out, too.  Other shows, like Bakugan, can be geared towards both boys and girls, because the main cast of characters is half and half.|`|HUdCBaJ0aa	Nope i look nothing like anime type but i still watch it. its want you like so its not weird and i felt the same way before i met some people like me they dont look like they would even know what anime is but they love it .|`|VM8wgfnBaa	It is totally not weird for girls to like anime cause there are a lot of girls that like anime like me for example I LOVE anime but u should really get into it u will probably like it! Trust me! :)|`|7hpXsYOCaa	Its not weird as long as you don't over do it and become an otaku(obsessive interests particularly anime and manga)

She's not financially dependent, and its not dangerous for her to leave as it is in many cases.<br>  <br>  On some level if she stays...she is sending the message that she agrees with his abusive ways. <br>  <br>  A victim will find another abuser, or become an abuser. The abuser will find another victim. <br>  <br>  So...IMHO they both should get a grip before one of them or both winds up dead.|`|AA10206525	Yes because reports say he is being investigated for other domestic violence situations which means it wasn't a first time offence and it is likely that he will do it again|`|Mrkchaemaa	yes i do and you know what she must like it because she got back with him. the next time he beats the **** out of her nobody should even pay her any mind.|`|nr68wEdLaa	defiantly. once a beater always a beater! and shes stupid for going back to him!

CRDl9nffaa	A bit for your normal non-falsetto range yes, with dedication and - guided - practice. But you won't increase it by a huge amount.<br>  <br>  I think it's possible to increase your effective falsetto range by a fair amount, effectively by taking control of the squeaking instead of sounding like somebody's jabbed you with a sharp pencil.<br>  <br>  But for both of these to work in two months you really need one-to-one guidance. Pay for some vocal lessons or sweet talk a  music teacher or musician/singer into giving you some time. And don't ever strain. It will shrink your range instead of stretching it.|`|4214bf7582b128803ab1a8a0abb3daf6aa	Vocal exercises , scales etc. will help but I don't know how much it will increase your range and it will take a long long time. Don't push your voice. Go to a singing teacher and have a test to find out what voice you have, alto ,soprano etc. and then just work on improving your tone etc etc and maybe range extension will be a part of that.

Many bad, violent things happen to people throughout the novel, even in the first chapter.

The movie is mostly true to the novel and it is rated R.

They are very fond of beautiful things in nature and art, and among them are to be found excellent art critics, artists, and writers.

They sometimes show a pecul-iar obstinacy, which is mistaken for will, and which the parents foolishly talk of breaking. One might better break the neck of a Pisces child than attempt to break his will. <br>  <br>  His stubbornness is usually the result of shame, which owes its origin to real delicacy and sensitive-ness, and which has been brought to the front by a mistake in government.

This is due to the fact that you can learn things quickly and without much effort. At times, you show that you are endowed with brilliant attainments, you are far-seeing, you are charitable and kind and hospitable. However, you are advised to think in terms of strength and act in terms of strength so that you can really achieve whatever you want to show. Though you are an excellent person but when anger overtakes you, you are irritable, quickly roused, easily annoyed and devoid of patience. The great thing for you to do on these occasions is to practice the art of mastering your own actions. Make up your mind to be strong and cultivate such qualities as determination. You are somewhat over-sensitive and there are times when you are put out needlessly. But your displeasure does not show itself in the form of a squabble. Disharmony is a thing you avoid at all costs. May be, you nurse a grievance, but this is something that others are never allowed to sense. You keep it strictly to yourself<br>  You have, above all, a facility for putting thoughts into eloquent words. Thus, you would do admirably as a journalist, a lecturer or even as a traveller salesman. Never would you be at a loss for something to say. This quality would fit you for a teacher also. But, when your impatient moods overtake you, you would fare badly. In almost any occupation requiring quick thinking, you will succeed very well. But, it must not be monotonous work or you will prove an utter failure. You like change and variety, so that any job which takes you up and down the country or to some far-flung outpost, will be suitable for you. You will fare better as your own master than when working for somebody else. You want to come and go when you like and, to be able to do this, you must be your own master. more info please write to me shanoomathur@yahoo.co.in|`|9azX3N4Laa	Wow your son is going make lots of money because he has two planets in the second house, this is the house of Taurus, the house of money and possessions. His Sun in Gemini and Venus in Gemini are in the second house. Not only that but his rising is in Taurus which rules over the entire birth chart. His Moon and Mercury is in Taurus in the first house. He will always think about money its always on his mind. He will make a least 6 figures year. Theres no need to push the issue these things will come naturally, its in his natural energy. Moon in Taurus says that you feel materially secure, Mercury in Taurus says you think of ways to make money. Oprah also has two planets in her 2nd house you know. So really this kid has 4 planets that deal with money and possessions and his ruling planet which Taurus is a money planet. If thats not enough he has his Midheaven in Capricorn. The Midheaven is in its natural sign when its capricorn. Thats the house of career and public image. That means he takes his career seriously and is responsbile.

956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	The show was named one of the five worst new television shows in TelevisionWeek’s semiannual Critics Poll. <br>  <br>  Crusoe was initially promoted as a regular TV show but, after the first few episodes aired (with poor ratings), the network listed it as a "high-action, fast-paced, thirteen-part series." NBC hasn't announced any plans to continue Crusoe past the 13 episodes.
kxLgxuE2aa	0.o<br>  I dunno.<br>  But I gotta watch that episode.|`|5RqvVmKaaa	CSI is great show but I stopped watching it - because there are so many great shows on the tv now and I've not got time to watch them all. Yes, by the way, CSI NY and CSI Miami are great shows too. <br>  Thus, I decided to stick with NCIS - at least there are not multiple spin offs from NCIS - at least not yet! Spin offs actually turn me off in the end. See Star Trek and Star Gate for where spin offs also tend to not just get lesser ratings but also put people off watching the original main shows.|`|SxaxLK02aa	that's what i heard....things are going to be real intense....|`|1gTy1XqXaa	No idea.<br>  I love Greg....he better not have his career ended.<br>  <br>  <br>  This kinda reminds me of CSI:NY series 4 finale..<br>  <br>  =[|`|eNl8GhPUaa	maybe he taints evidence. don't know. but if they off one more character i'm gonna quit watching.

2qVOjNvhaa	NCIS is currently in season 6.  There are 8 new episodes left to air for this season.  NCIS (current season) is on CBS on Tuesdays at 8:00 pm et/pt.<br>  <br>  CBS has not announced it's 2009-2010 schedule, however given how well the show is doing in the ratings we can assume with reasonable confidence that the show will be renewed.  Assuming it is renewed then season 7 would begin this fall.

cy7freI8aa	Your guitar probably sounds a lot brighter and a little louder. Don't worry about it, you have to break strings in. In less than a week they will sound 'normal'.<br>  <br>  Guitar strings deaden over time due to build-up of dead skin, dirt, etc. Brand new strings have nothing on them to dull the sound that's why they sound so odd to you.|`|VCzsfVM5aa	I like to give new strings a gentle stretching while tuning,  It will need some time to get the new strings to stretch and hold a tune,  also if you went with a lighter gauge, adjusting the pickup heights can give you some better tone, that is if electric.

4f53edbce16f4673f58a9dcccc9dfddfaa	I wouldn't say the goth scene is prejudice free.  There seems to be a higher level of acceptance of people overall in it, but of course there are some people within the scene who are prejudiced to some extent or another.<br>  Anyway, addressing The Cramps, I've only heard a few of their songs and honestly am not really that into them, so I can't speak specifically on why their EP is called that, but there's other uses of Nazi related things by goth and goth-related bands, so it simply could be just used to stir up some kind of reaction, not that they were really supporters of Nazis.  I mean, take Siouxsie Sioux for example.  She wore an armband with a swastika and I believe it's more just for the aesthetic effect and shock.  She wasn't like espousing a political view or anything.  Or also, although not goth, within neofolk there's a lot of Nazi connection.  Death in June has a lot of Nazi related stuff in their music, and I think some people take that as them being seriously Nazi, but from what I heard it's just more an interest in it, not the political view of the band.  I mean, the singer of Death in June is gay, so I very much doubt he's prejudiced in general.  <br>  So like I said, I don't know too much about The Cramps, but I'm guessing Nazibilly Werewolfen has more to do with image or shock or an simply an interest than it being their political views.

m4PtEEDNaa	...any one of the scenes, where Clint's character interacts with his barber...<br>  <br>  ...the scene where Clint's character, and the barber character, teaches the kid how to engage 'man' talk, and the lead-in for the 'job interview' scene...<br>  <br>  ...the hilariously hateful and spiteful cross-eyeballing and commentary between Clint's character, and the old woman next door...<br>  <br>  ...the 'confession' scene, where the young priest was expecting Clint's character to confess some heinious sins, and was taken aback, when Clint related only the most minor of transgretions...<br>  <br>  ...the 'self-sacrifice' scene, where you think that Clint is going to recklessly try to blow away those hoodlums, but ends up getting blown away, himself....in front of witnesses, which leads to the outright arrest of the hoodlums...<br>  <br>  ...the ending relevation, whereby the kid gets Clint's character's Gran Torino, when Clint's character passes away, leading into the pre-credit shot of the kid, driving off down the road, and to his future...to the  heart-felt lyrics of that 'Gran Tornio' song...<br>  <br>  Note: the 'get off my lawn' scene is a good one, as well; however, after having seen that scene so many times, in repeated viewings of the film's trailer, it has become, for lack of a better word, commonplace, and has quickly taken it's place in the lexicon of Clint Eastwood movie dialogue, along side such classic lines as "Go Ahead...Make My Day" and "A Man's Gotta Know His Limitations"...<br>  <br>  Personal Note: The varied critics out there, who are giving this film some well-deserved positive reviews, and yet are calling this movie "Grumpy Old Dirty Harry" are being somewhat unfair, in this respect.

d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	As far as similar 'driving' stories- One day A few years back I was driving to work early in the morning. It was winter so the roads were icy. Well, as I was driving  a bunch of birds that were in the road all flew up at once so I swerved to miss them. Swerving caused me to lose control of the car since it was icy, and I fish tailed all over the road before I finally regained control of my car. Thankfully, I was the only car on the road. I looked in my rear view mirror to see if the birds were still hanging around.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ...There were no birds. It was a big pile of leaves that got blown up by a big gust  of wind.<br>  <br>  Thankfully it was early enough that no other cars were around to witness that embarrassing blunder.|`|eaf82079d386f1be514388360f3d4ae2aa	i was driving<br>  and there were 2 ****** turtles on the road<br>  like 10 miles apart<br>  i'm like<br>  wtf i have never seen turtles on a road<br>  why today there are 2?|`|594sWJ3Taa	nah|`|YkI63LFZaa	i barely missed a dead boar...bad a$$|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Had three deer run out in front of me at 8:40pm last week.

2a9jRZGRaa	A Daytime Affair<br>  <br>  A woman was having a daytime affair while her husband was at work. One wet and lusty day she was in bed with her boyfriend when, to her horror, she heard her husband's car pull into the driveway. <br>  <br>  "Oh my - Hurry! Grab your clothes and jump out the window. My husband's home early!" "I can't jump out the window ~ It's raining out there!" "If my husband catches us in here, he'll kill us both!" she replied. He's got a hot temper and a gun, so the rain is the least of your problems!"<br>  <br>  So the boyfriend scoots out of bed, grabs his clothes and jumps out the window! As he ran down the street in the pouring rain, he quickly discovered he had run right into the middle of the town's annual marathon, so he started running along beside the others, about 300 of them.<br>  <br>  Being naked, with his clothes tucked under his arm, he tried to blend in as best he could. After a little while a small group of runners who had been watching him with some curiosity, jogged closer. "Do you always run in the nude?" one asked. "Oh yes!" he replied, gasping for air. "It feels so wonderfully free!"<br>  <br>  Another runner moved alongside him. "Do you always run carrying your clothes with you under your arm?" "Oh , yes" our friend answered breathlessly. "That way I can get dressed right at the end of the run and get in my car to go home!<br>  <br>  Then a third runner cast his eyes a little lower and queried, " Do you always wear a condom when you run? "<br>  <br>  "Nope........ . just when it's raining".|`|POqwp3Fiaa	There was an old man who always rode his bike to his brother's house every weekend. It took him 2 hours and he alway's made it by there by 2PM. <br>  <br>  One day he tried to make it in 1 hour. Collapsing on a hill from exhaustion, while sitting there, a Corvette pulls up and asks him if he needs a ride. The man looks at his watch and sees he would be late if not, but there is already a passenger, so he asks how?<br>  <br>  "No problem," says the man in the corvette, "I've got a rope in the back and we'll tie your bike to the back bumper and you can ride." <br>  <br>  The man says, "Ok!"<br>  <br>  They take off and the driver yells back, "Just yell BEEP BEEP if I'm going to fast." No problem the man thinks. They come to an Intersection and a Ferrari pulls up, the man's eye's widen in fright.<br>  <br>  Sure enough, the light changes and THEY'RE OFF! Anyway, the guy made it to his brothers on time and the Vette lost. <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, at the local police dept... "Hey guys the weirdest thing just happened to me.

Each man must collect a different fruit as to that of the other two. Once you have done this, return to me, and I will tell you what to do."<br>  <br>  So the men run out and began to search for any fruit. The first man returns after a while with 10 apples. The Chief grinned wickedly and said, "Now you must take those 10 apples and shove them up your *** without making any facial expression or flinching. If you fail to do so, I will kill you!"<br>  <br>  The poor man gets up to number 8 and then screams, as the pain was so intense. The King killed him right then and there, and returned to see the second man coming back with 10 strawberries. The second man got his instructions, too, and was up to the 10th strawberry, when all of a sudden, for no apparent reason, he begins laughing hysterically. So the King killed him, too, just as he did with the first man.<br>  <br>  The first man and the second man meet up in Heaven, and the first man asks, "Why did you laugh? You were on your last strawberry, and you could have gotten away!"<br>  <br>  The second man said with a little smile, "Yeah, I know, but just as I got to the 10th, I saw the last guy walking up with his arms full of pineapples!"<br>  <br>  <br>  2) There were three little girls, the first went up to her mother and said "Mummy, why am I called Rose?"<br>  <br>  The mother replied, "Because when you were born a Rose fell on your head."<br>  <br>  The second girl said, "Mummy, why am I called Daisy?"<br>  <br>  And the mother replied, "Because when you were born a daisy fell on your head."<br>  <br>  The third girl said, "Aabbubbbababuaabuba"<br>  <br>  The mother replied, "Shut up Fridge"<br>  <br>  LOLLL|`|FQi1qZhpaa	What Do You Call 100 Nuns In A Shop?<br>  <br>  Virgin Megastore|`|onwVYZ9Aaa	yes thanks|`|miAboZnMaa	Hilarious Things to Do in An Elevator<br>  Crack open your briefcase or purse, peek inside and ask, “Got enough air in there?<br>  Stand silently and motionless in the corner, facing the wall, without getting off.<br>  When arriving at your floor, grunt and strain to yank the doors open, then act embarrassed when they open by themselves.<br>  Greet everyone getting on the elevator with a warm handshake and ask them to call you Admiral.<br>  Lean against the button panel.<br>  Stare at another passenger for awhile, then announce in horror, “You’re one of THEM” and back away slowly.<br>  Wear a puppet on your hand and use it to talk to the other passengers.<br>  Say “Ding” at each floor.<br>  Bring a chair along.<br>  Make explosion noises when anyone presses a button.<br>  Stare, grinning at another passenger for awhile, and then announce, “I have new socks on.”<br>  Try to make personal calls on the emergency phone.<br>  When there’s only one other person in the elevator, tap them on the shoulder and then pretend it wasn’t you.<br>  Push the buttons and pretend they give you a shock.

l0BN70vKaa	One of the keys is to have patience because some people get so pissed so easy that the disagreement gets worst. <br>  Another is to talk to the person that you having the disagreement don't yell or scream at them!<br>  Try working it out and making sure to understand their side too!<br>  <br>  Good LUCK!|`|ou7gpgRpaa	I punch him in the facee and have sex with his mom and his girlfriend.|`|sOpIMeJSaa	i tell my friends parents all their dirty secrets. then i post nude picture of them on the internet, then i go hide where they can't find me.|`|nZ4cOSDZaa	try and work it out in a mature way|`|4MVIJvbiaa	We always work out in the mature way.|`|aTzcqC4Naa	in a mature way, i hope.|`|M8wexR5Haa	were just like whatev and move on|`|SH2ysn6faa	we argue then we handle it in a mature way|`|hpu4s84Waa	me and my bestfriend work it out in a mature way, but then sometimes we will go ask someone else who they think is right.<br>  but the mature way is always the safest way for everybody.|`|FjqJs7gMaa	what ever problem you have wit 1 person handle it wit 1 person. but if you guys cant agree then agree to disagree. and smoke a L it past already.|`|rscHoVntaa	Depends on which friend. Usually I'll tell them why I'm mad, sometimes accusingly, and if they can give a good reason, i'll accept it. I'm usually the first one to apologize.|`|SeqyHojCaa	Usually I try to handle it maturely, but I don't often receive maturity back.|`|uzySXITWaa	well everyones different.. but you should handle it in a mature way.|`|LsoCSNHbaa	of course in the mature way. its always better|`|EM1unTflaa	Handle it a mature way.|`|4ZiQ7epIaa	i throw cheese at their head... XD|`|hWd4dXwEaa	we play super smash bros brawl so that way we cant hurt each other :)|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I don't get vindictive - that's a waste of my time and energy (and emotionally it wears me out).  Sometimes I just choose to move on without that person as a friend if it's a major disagreement.  Life is too short and you need to surround yourself with good people.|`|M8f4BorPaa	in a mature way.|`|iFTa9FqZaa	typically try to work it out, but every now and then there is a 'friend' that just isn't worth it anymore|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I'm not vindictive, it's a waste of energy.

izlHkPmVaa	I watched the whole series and I thought that the plot stayed on course the whole time.|`|Zkw93uUyaa	When i watched inuyasha the plot was fine they may have had a couple of filler episodes but besides that it was just fine|`|SvVbZfjQaa	Initial episodes of Inuyasha are very interesting till episodes 100-110. as the mangaka hadnt finished the manga so the anime story differs from there but the manga is gr8 and is completed u can read it here just search it<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mangatraders.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangatraders.com/</a>|`|Z0Wnh4QEaa	it has a great plot, just alot of filler episodes.
1KkMINS7aa	Ren first confronts his uncle at the end of episode 20, then at the beginning of 21 we see their fight, and resulting capture. Then Ren and Jun are first shown locked up at the end of 21, but I think most of their dungeon scenes are in 22.

0muvYszmaa	In a way they are because<br>  if you do something good your eyes are all awake but slouchy<br>  if you do something bad your eyes are wide open and teary<br>  if you are scared you are stuck in a gaze and normally unable to move<br>  there are plenty of others but it is true...|`|Lj2mo4ooaa	Yes, you can tell a great deal by looking into someone's eyes.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	There are times when you can read a person by the look in their eyes...so maybe|`|UNFlbMzpaa	No|`|7lPqA7H1aa	No.|`|Emk4xuTuaa	I believe that they are, because I can usually read what is in a persons eyes. Just what I believe.|`|85YtzzKraa	Well I guess you could say that because when a guy is attracted to or if he likes a girl then his pupils dilate! And vice vera!|`|KGppArcfaa	No, all I ever see in peoples eyes are pupils and little lines, I have never seen a soul yet|`|zDJVWlscaa	They're also fun to poke.|`|HEzyvbDvaa	Indeed it is and so is my heart without them i would be lost..|`|RyYV3aXlaa	what happens to the blind ? wow that's so cold..|`|ou7gpgRpaa	Not if you don't have windex!|`|zvAfMgf3aa	yes of course|`|G0Bk1Piwaa	Yes! The eyes are often called with some justification,"The windows of the soul,' as they can send many different non-verbal signals. For reading body language this is quite useful as looking at people's eyes are a normal part of communication.(Whilst gazing at other parts of the body can be seen as rather rude).|`|FjqJs7gMaa	Yes Lil One, that's i can tell if your lying. So were shades every you go. and when your interested in a man pull your shades down for a second then take it away by turning around. He will do the rest.?|`|GrmIVttXaa	apparently not. because too many idiots voted for the kenyan born muslim who is in the house...and no soul wanted communism/socialism..unless you are a loser.|`|2gYrChKDaa	i dont think it is. <br>  i think it is your heart|`|EM1unTflaa	I don't know. I guess.|`|4ZiQ7epIaa	i think so xD|`|PyYYWqnUaa	lol|`|hKVh1EIcaa	no the heart is
29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Aside from her celebrity she became an ambassador for Unicef and traveled throughout Africa and impoverished countries aiding in humanitarian issues such as starvation, drought, etc. She was amazing. She did so much to give back to the world. Although she will always be remembered as an acting icon her work for Unicef is awe inspiring.|`|HQKuzxulaa	She was beautiful and adorable, she had class and style and she was elegant to an extreme. There'll never be another one like her.

NthdRZafaa	i think they could. i believe they IT has a song out called "bush knocked down the towers" and that is pretty political. so with IT's powerful lyrics mixed with JMT, i think that would make a very good track|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	They could definitely do a violent track together. I'm sure Tech would love to actually work with a producer for once.|`|xb3RjkV2aa	I don't think Technique likes JMT that much. Apparently his secret track with Diabolic on "Dance with the devil" was actually a diss on JMT, just a rumour though.<br>  <br>  Tech does rap about politics, what are you talking about? Lol, most of his songs are a diss to the Illuminati and World leaders :)

HBUbDnnyaa	Leah's part isn't really major til Eclipse and I don't even think it'll be that big. All the girls listed are good but each has a downfall I mean like Leah ClearWater is an Indian she isn't Hmong like Brenda. I know the nationalities may look similar but not that similar and Vanessa is nothing like Leah and she isnt a good actor. I heard on an Filipina chanel that Latsamy had never had such a big acting job and they were worried that maybe she couldn't do it, especially since much other big names auditioned for the part. But Leah may not be in New Moon. So the question is who will be her in Eclipse lol|`|AwSfJhZCaa	She may not even be in New Moon as there is only one time in the book that she actually appears(she's mentioned once or twice but Bella sees her only at the spaghetti party at Jake's) so they might not even have her in New Moon.|`|lnmrIFBTaa	Vanessa or Brenda probably Vanessa.|`|Yh7GOkZHaa	I hope Vanessa Hudgens doesnt do it, but I heard that America Ferrera wants to be Leah.|`|SaAQpxLJaa	vanessa sucks and the other 2 idk i'd probably say vanessa or latsamy|`|IoNxcFH6aa	Vanessa is hot|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	none of them are native so none of them should be playing a native. how about using a REAL native actress for the part? there are many. time hollywood stops ignoring us. <br>  you would never think to use someone who could pass as black in a black role right? why the double standard?|`|iOW2aLeGaa	iv heard that there not putting leah in it either.<br>  But if they do i realy really dont want vanessa in it lol.<br>  I think Brenda song<br>  xx

awzXuJMDaa	“Why did the chicken cross the road?”<br>  <br>  BARACK OBAMA:<br>  The chicken crossed the road because it was time for a CHANGE! The chicken wanted CHANGE! And HOPE! It looked HOPEFUL!<br>  <br>  JOHN McCAIN:<br>  My friends, that chicken crossed the road because he recognized the need to engage in cooperation and dialogue with all the chickens on the other side of the road.<br>  <br>  HILLARY CLINTON:<br>  When I was First Lady, I personally helped that little chicken to cross the road. This experience makes me uniquely qualified to ensure — right from Day One! — that every chicken in this country gets the chance it deserves to cross the road. But then, this really isn’t about me, although I clearly remember having to dodge enemy fire as Chelsea and I tried to cross the road.<br>  <br>  DR. PHIL:<br>  The problem we have here is that this chicken won’t realize that he must first deal with the problem on ‘THIS’ side of the road before it goes after the problem on the ‘OTHER SIDE’ of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he’s acting by not taking on his ‘CURRENT’ problems before adding ‘NEW’ problems.<br>  <br>  OPRAH:<br>  Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross this road so bad. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I’m going to give this chicken a car so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.<br>  <br>  GEORGE W. BUSH:<br>  We don’t really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road, or not. The chicken is either against us, or for us. There is no middle ground here.<br>  <br>  COLIN POWELL:<br>  Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road… .<br>  <br>  JOHN KERRY:<br>  Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken’s intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it.<br>  <br>  NANCY GRACE:<br>  That chicken crossed the road because he’s GUILTY! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks.<br>  <br>  PAT BUCHANAN:<br>  To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.<br>  <br>  MARTHA STEWART:<br>  No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer’s Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information.<br>  <br>  DR SEUSS:<br>  Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I’ve not been told.<br>  <br>  ERNEST HEMINGWAY:<br>  To die in the rain. Alone.<br>  <br>  RUSH LIMBAUGH:<br>  Because the chicken was gay! Can’t you people see the plain truth?’ That’s why they call it the ‘other side.’ Yes, my friends, that chicken is gay. And if you eat that chicken, you will become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out this abomination that the liberal media white washes with seemingly harmless phrases like ‘the other side. That chicken should not be crossing the road. It’s as plain and as simple as that.<br>  <br>  GRANDPA:<br>  In my day we didn’t ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough.<br>  <br>  BARBARA WALTERS:<br>  Isn’t that intewesting? In a few moments, we will be wistening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heart warming story of how it experienced a sewious case of molting, and went on to accompwish its wife wong dweam of cwossing the woad.<br>  <br>  ARISTOTLE:<br>  It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.<br>  <br>  JOHN LENNON:<br>  Imagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together, in peace.<br>  <br>  BILL GATES:<br>  I have just released eChicken2007, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your check book. Internet Explorer is an integral part of the Chicken. This new platform is much more stable and will never cra…#@&&^(C% reboot.<br>  <br>  ALBERT EINSTEIN:<br>  Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken?<br>  <br>  BILL CLINTON:<br>  I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What is your definition of chicken?<br>  <br>  AL GORE:<br>  I invented the chicken!<br>  <br>  COLONEL SANDERS:<br>  Did I miss one?<br>  <br>  DICK CHENEY:<br>  Where’s my gun?<br>  <br>  AL SHARPTON:<br>  Why are all the chickens white? We need some black chickens.<br>  <br>  REVEREND JEREMIAH WRIGHT:<br>  Damn that chicken. Does that make me unpatriotic?|`|aCZFvjV1aa	This chicken must be attracted to traffic lights or something :S Or maybe this chicken has a mind of a dodo and followed the watermelon...Or possibly it was just a suicidal chicken...who knows!?|`|AbB3zdYwaa	To get away from that Chickfala phyco path<br>  <br>  =D<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Brad Pitt!<br>  <br>  I know I'd cross the road for a peice of that!|`|kiefexLwaa	so he didnt miss the moooooovie. no wait, that was the cow...|`|Bd4cGbEXaa	to get to the other side|`|5dc44f1c97d196e64cd52bb0686a1abbaa	this question AGAIN? who cares!|`|M3kPrjXWaa	Prove to a possum,it can be done.|`|rcEq136naa	To get to the other side :D|`|WSIZKAQcaa	to go to KFC|`|GTja6ouWaa	Too dream of a better world where chickens can cross roads and not be questioned of their motives.|`|POqwp3Fiaa	Because Miley Cyrus wasn't available...?|`|594sWJ3Taa	to lay an egg or to get to the other side|`|doHNEvf8aa	TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE!|`|AA11625446	To get away from Cornel Sanders
