2a188c848f43236acb5e544e37f25a88aa	I like 1800petmeds shampoo.  It's an oatmeal shampoo that doesn't wash off flea treatments like Frontline or Advantage, and it doesn't have any perfumes.  It leaves my dog's coat soft and fresh smelling.  Also, she has sensitive skin on her belly and it seems to be soothing for her.    The cost is about $7 for an 18oz. bottle.  I buy two at a time to save on shipping.  Shipping cost is worth not having to make a trip to the store.|`|230de8c8ef5f153f11aae5f1a15af8d6aa	******DOG shampoo!!!!!!********    NO conditioner!!!

One I love is called triple play.  I get it from Petsmart I its made by cardinal.  Another great shampoo, but its expensiv e is hylight its a white bottle with green lable runnign down the side of the bottle.  That one is great for sensitive skin or allergies.  I buy my conditioner online from Jeffers pet.  I get the huge jug of cocounut smell. I love it.

90fd6688b8cbf6f61a55e9d603c7d24eaa	Depends on what type of tick it is.  If they little harmless bush ticks - you must get the whole tick out. Use your nails to press down into the skin around the tick, so you can "pinch" it out head and all.  If it is a paralysis tick, it may be a better idea to take your cat to the vet, he may need some meds as well    Good luck|`|AA11896821	I smother ticks with Vaseline. They then can't breathe and let go of the area. I then pick it up and kill it with tweezers. Good luck. You might get your yard sprayed if you are able.|`|9d0749e39bca81dad37e989c00f68ce9aa	Use tweezers, grab it as close to the skin as possible then twist. Flush it down the toilet. Clean the wound.    If that grosses you out then you can pour alcohol on it and it might pull out on its own.|`|bda548d04636cba0cc48efe4bfdbb21baa	Take you thumb and first finger and pinch it right at the skin and pull it out.   It is very important to get the head of the tick.   It is hard to do that.   After you pull it out, take your finger and go over the area real good.  If you feel something still there, get a pair of tweezers and pull the head out.|`|2be37fb0a8ec70a08cda72b57866a719aa	Well just get some tweezers and pull it off, then maybe put something like alcohol on the spot where it came off if you want to|`|7a565fb6a20376a65061df1d94d8efc2aa	if you have a good flea spray, then spray the tick and it will let go. if you don't want to do that, then you get some tweezers and pull the it at the head and then flush it down the toilet. (its VERY important to pull it at the head, because if you don't, then the head will stay in your cat and just grow its body back.)|`|53575753b5002686013d9e904c435e4aaa	You can pick it off with tweezers but if you dont have any then try to pick it off with your finger nails. After you pick it off you need to burn it.|`|ba4e3dac1254bb12670a9e3bab294b6aaa	pretty much the same way you would get a tick off anything else...very carefully.    (METHOD 1)  tweezer it at the base of the head (as close to the skin/flesh as possible)  turn clockwise slowly while pulling out carefully    (METHOD 2)  put petroleum jelly or any other sticky substance on that will be slow to run off (If you are lucky, this will suffocate the tick until it lets go and removes itself for air.)|`|0134bd4edf59968038f99ecfc6ba800eaa	The best way i've found to get ticks to back out is to put a heat supply to it. This takes two people to get it right the first time. If you can wrap the cat in a towel and still get to the tick, that's great. put on a glove, clip a little hair off at the site. Then find a small stiff piece of wire and heat the wire hot. Stick that heat to the tick with your help mate holding the cat firmly. That tick will back out, mouth ,head, and body. Here in Georgia we get ticks with "Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever". We always check our skin out after a day in the woods.|`|3e4929f781d931f54ea944d525cdc70faa	Get a cotten ball and put alchol or proxside on it it may sting so hissing is normal. dabbing the wet cotten ball on the tick loosen it up. take  apair of twisers ahn pull the tick out then flush it. if you dont have twisers use a thin cloth or tishue.

If you can, you might want to check out a breeder.

A common budgie shouldn't cost you more than 25$, but if i were you, I'd spend the extra money on a hand-raised bird, versus parent-raised. Budgies bite.  And it freaking hurts.|`|AA12210496	maybe you can find a non chain pet store, the one near me is a much better store that petco or petsmart will ever be.|`|454c95cd0a515ed1956bd5b039e602edaa	No pet store is good.

5c43980ca367e1bb58fe9e120a8a159faa	Yep. Cooking oil would work best, as it's probably the least toxic. Your cat will probably try and lick it off afterwards. Make sure you're a bathroom so as to not get it all over the place, and be ready to clean up a mess when your cat gets free.|`|5598bd1170afaaf3f964f480815cc0a6aa	Call the vet and ask them what they think will remove the glue.     You can try a bit of oil to see if that doesn't help remove the glue.     I don't believe glue mouse traps have poison in them. I  believe they work by glueing the mouse into the trap and they stay there until they die.  You can double check the package to be sure about that though.|`|85bda04ac924a4b02420215418c17befaa	I would also get to the vet because the glue can probably harm her/him if he/she tries to lick it off.  In the mean time, I would try some warm water.  Also, check the label on the trap. If it says to call poison control for a person, I would do the same for your cat!|`|AA10205049	Check with a local grooming salon.  Most should have a tar/sap remover product that is quite effective in removing sticky stuff.

8deea5ebb4438a155f8fd9495b5af684aa	Oops!  You are not Indian? Sorry for the "inside" references.  I was talking about Krishna in his form of being a cowherd which is symbolic of being a great teacher and sustainer to us.  You mean an actual "member" like a mother-in-law?  Not like on the books as a "member" but greatly honored--sometimes more than some of the human "members", to be honest, unfortunately.  Definitely will not get an arranged marriage.  In Hindu culture (remember that India is a composite of many cultures, though "Hindu" is the most predominant), there is always a rational, quite reasonable basis for what others might call a "superstition" or "strange habit".  In the case of cows, not is it only with the Story about Shiva and Parvati (and Nandi who is a bull and one of Shiva's sons), but they are profoundly symbolic of the relationship of Krishna to us and the idea of the interplay of forces that are good for us and that give us life and raise us to be better, and our willingness to participate with those forces to show our appreciation and to strengthen the expression of those forces in our lives.  For more info on that, read Bagavad Gita, Gita Govinda, and read anything about Krishna (but stay away from ISKCON, a cult that is not Hindu by any standards and thus not a clear source of info on Krishna), on Hindunet.org, etc., then you will begin to intuit the rich symbology, poetry, and faith surrounding the "mystery" of the sacred cow.  A lot of people think it's crazy to stop traffic to let a cow or two pass, not use them for food in a country with many food problems, etc., but in India the strange things are the most beneficial--if only in terms of psychological nurturing--and thus of greater importance and meaning than a Western-style quick fix or easy traffic.  India is not just another country--it is quite literally another planet, and when in Rome, enjoy the scenery as much as you can...|`|3122ae6f8b98a3cf8f31941e30e7d8deaa	cow we has a god. don,t kill and don,t eat. only serve and love|`|b4cf53cf10c9e94d57ff0b543500aeacaa	my grand dad had some cows in our town in our ancestrol house.

As in every religion there is a reason why cows were reverd sacred. thousand of years ago when Indians were meat eaters like all other countries. In severe famines ,to prevent people from killing the cow (for food)which had multiple uses , smart leaders declared it  a sacred animal not to be killed. later influences of religions like buddhism and jainism reinforced vegetarianism. Respect for animals has exsisted since time immemorial. our scriptures talk of feeding all animals birds dogs and specially the sacred cow. Though in towns the trend of feeding cows is still prevelent ,as its considered a good deed , their conditions are very bad. dairy owners set them free to feed on roads where they are hit by cars or by vegetable vendors..on whose food they might feed. they are given injections to produce more milk which are harmful to them. food given in plastic bags leads to their cancer and death. people who consider them sacred should do something for their welfare.  in short , cows are considered sacred in India, people feed them , truck drivers avoid hiting them (though they are not so considertae about dogs) etc..|`|AA12245576	I like cows :)|`|BKPRoap9aa	According to Hindu Relegion, in India, Cow is sacred.

Shiva married Parvati. Parvati's father's head was cut and his head needed a replacement/transplantation and it was a cow that offered its head. Hence, cow is sacred. That was relegious. From moral point of view, a cow gives milk, from which yhou get butter, cheese, curd, buttermilk etc. Cows urine and **** have medicinal values. Cow is a farmers friend for ploughing. Even after the death of a cow, its skin is useful. For all these benefits, man keeps a cow with him for days and enjoys the benefits rather than killing and having it for a meal for just one day, its like the story of a farmer who killed the duck because that gave a golden duck one day. He thought if the duck can give a golden egg each day, what will happen if he kills it and takes all the eggs from it and to his effect of greed, there was nothing but a dead duck, when he cut its stomach. Nice to know you being interested in our relegion and facts that you want to learn, good going, all the best, take care.|`|862cb78b94cca04adf56b61f27695206aa	the cow is a domestic animal. it is very sacred in india. that is becoz the cow is known as the ultimate mother. people wonder why only the cow?? well think about it, if a human gives birth to a baby, and somehow cannot give it its own milk, the cow always gives it. indians dont eat cow....the cows are an important source of milk . the cows are not treated a family members, but like godsent angels.|`|86P5Bgfvaa	we indians respect all animals, but the cow is the most respected animal of all.|`|AA11750081	Gees, GROW UP already.....

21c6d542a24b57f03cabb1677776d51aaa	I think one of the best things you could do is to check outs some books at your public library on training a parakeet and do some googling on the net to see what you can find.  I'm sure they can be trained but you may need the book/instructions in front of you.|`|1MSNuCwhaa	I tought one of my birds to fly back into its cage, but it took a really long time and it was an accident.|`|4de4d91147854dc1591e3ae7e4e5546eaa	Yes there are ways to train a parakeet. My parakeet is 8 months old and knows how to step-up, shake hands, turn around, and give kisses.    The first thing you need to do is gain their trust.     This book is a great book and taught me all I know about training my parakeet:    Parakeet: Your Happy Healthy Pet by Julie Rach Mancini    You can get it at Borders or www.amazon.com    I did learn a new technique while training my lovebird though. You put them in the bathtub (if its wings are clipped).     In the book it explain that holding the bird close to your heart calms them. While you are doing this you need to talk to them in a soothing voice and maybe even sing a soft song to them.     When you are teaching the bird step-up sometime it helps to push gently on their belly right above their feet to get them to lift their feet up onto your finger while saying "step-up".    This website is how I got the idea on how to teach him how to turn around and shake hands. Most of these tricks are more extreme and this is a different type of bird, but the site is still neat.    http://www.myspace.com/my_friend_aj|`|pm0AzP4zaa	yes you can train a parakeet ,  i have a bird that ive had for 2 weeks. i taught him to wave in that time.  if you really want to teach your bird tricks to make it easier get its wings cliped. safer for the bird and it will before more dependent on you and its easier to train tricks ect.    catch|`|AY46Q8JYaa	Parakeet training takes a lot of time, and a lot of paitence.

Here's some info that might help you decide.  How to grade your dog's food: Start with a grade of 100:     1) For every listing of "by-product", subtract 10 points   2) For every non-specific animal source ("meat" or "poultry", meat, meal or fat) reference, subtract 10 points   3) If the food contains BHA, BHT, or ethoxyquin, subtract 10 points   4) For every grain "mill run" or non-specific grain source, subtract 5 points   5) If the same grain ingredient is used 2 or more times in the first five ingredients (I.e. "ground brown rice", "brewers rice", "rice flour" are all the same grain), subtract 5 points   6) If the protein sources are not meat meal and there are less than 2 meats in the top 3 ingredients, subtract 3 points   7) If it contains any artificial colorants, subtract 3 points   8 ) If it contains ground corn or whole grain corn, subtract 3points   9) If corn is listed in the top 5 ingredients, subtract 2 more points   10) If the food contains any animal fat other than fish oil, subtract 2 points   11) If lamb is the only animal protein source (unless your dog is allergic to other protein sources), subtract 2 points   12) If it contains soy or soybeans, subtract 2 points   13) If it contains wheat (unless you know that your dog is not allergic to wheat), subtract 2 points   14) If it contains beef (unless you know that your dog is not allergic to beef), subtract 1 point   15) If it contains salt, subtract 1 point     Extra Credit:   1) If any of the meat sources are organic, add 5 points   2) If the food is endorsed by any major breed group or nutritionist, add 5 points   3) If the food is baked not extruded, add 5 points   4) If the food contains probiotics, add 3 points   5) If the food contains fruit, add 3 points   6) If the food contains vegetables (NOT corn or other grains), add 3 points   7) If the animal sources are hormone-free and antibiotic-free, add 2 points   8 ) If the food contains barley, add 2 points   9) If the food contains flax seed oil (not just the seeds), add 2 points   10) If the food contains oats or oatmeal, add 1 point   11) If the food contains sunflower oil, add 1 point   12) For every different specific animal protein source (other than the   first one; count "chicken" and "chicken meal" as only one protein   source, but "chicken" and "" as 2 different sources), add 1 point   13) If it contains glucosamine and chondroitin, add 1 point   14) If the vegetables have been tested for pesticides and are   pesticide-free, add 1 point     Score:   94-100+ = A 86-93 = B 78-85 = C 70-77 = D 69 and below = F     Here are some foods that have already been scored.

There are some very highly recommended dog foods out though that I have been told they use saw dust as a filler in there.

EDIT: Some foods to avoid..Cheap low quality foods,  Pedigree, Purina(Especially Dog Chow, I mean look at the name!) No name, Super saver, Old roy, Alpo, Kibbles n Bits. Then there are the high price but not so high quality foods like...  Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin/Techni-Cal.    Foods like Nutro and Nutrience are inbetweeners because they do have some ok foods and they arent super low quality, or super high price..

I even used to eed Nutro.    Most dogfoods are made out of diseased and rotting animal carcuses, that arte unfilt for human consption.     There are good brands of dog foods you can get, however, nowadays.     Some are: Innova, Wellness, Natural Balance, Solid Gold, Prairie, and Aunt Jennie's.    All can be bought at specialty dog food stores. Natural Balance you can get at Petsmart.    Stay away from all the popluare brands you see on TV, and most of the ones sold at petsmart.    Stay away from brands such as Purina, Iams, Hills Science Diet, Eukanuba, Kibbles and bits...ect.     NOTHING good for your dog in those!!!!!    Table or so called *people* food is much healthier for them than that!!!!    I suggest going to amazon.com and buying the book *Foods that pets die for.*(It will tell yo what those so called Natural and balanced dog foods are really made of, as well as how they came to be.    Good luck!|`|8d2d6600ad3faf4f129ba81e7917098eaa	The best food that you can buy is an all natural, premium food.  Nutro, Pedigree, Dog Chow are not "Premium" Foods.  It's good that you're checking into this because by feeding your dog the best food that you can possibly afford, will save you money as your dog ages.      I recommend Natural Balance or Solid Gold and feeding dry as well as canned.

4de4d91147854dc1591e3ae7e4e5546eaa	Yes you can. There would be no need to quarantine it since you just got it yesterday.     However the reason he could be lonely is just because you did just take him away from a whole flock. You should give him time.    I have a parakeet as well and he is alone and is very much bonded to me. He gives me kisses. He can shake hands and he knows how to turn around all on command.     If you get another bird it is just going to be bonded to that bird and not you. Also, do you have a large enough cage for two parakeets?     Your parakeet will seem down for a while until he is used to his new environment. Mine took a long time before he was like he is today. He was just 3 months old when I got him. So he was just a baby and didn't know how to do much. Now he plays all day long and loves me so much that he preens me too.|`|4cf35c900baf2aa599f838360f31396eaa	If your only reasoning is that he seems lonely, you need to do more reading.    Birds are social, but they are great pets if they bond to you.  Give your bird time to settle in, play with it's toys, and bond to you.  Train it.  Play with it.  If you still think it is lonely 6 months from now, then talk to your parents about getting another bird.    If you get another bird, you will STILL need a full other cage set up.  They may not get along and can cause serious injury to each other fighting.      Also, if you managed to get a male and female and the happened to sucessfully breed you could run into other problems.  The birds in the store right now are probably from the same breeder and possibly the same parents.  You would have a whole other set of problems at that point.    Make sure that you are feeding your budgie a good diet.  After seed conversion, it should be eating 80% pellets, 15% healthy fresh foods, 5% seeds and treats.    They DO NOT need grit!  They shell their seeds so they do not need it in their diet.  In fact, it can kill them.    Make sure that you have 3-4 different types of toys in the cage for him to play with.  Rotate new toys in on a regular basis, every couple of weeks or when one is destroyed.      Let your bird out daily.  Give it time to bond with you.  Talk to it, let it ride on your shoulder, train it to do simple tricks.    Make sure that you keep it's wings clipped for saftey.  Do not take it outside unless it is in a cage or on a leash.  Make sure that it can bathe weekly if not daily.

The best thing to do is to purchase a bird of the same sex. if you were planing on breeding them you should find a bird some wear ells just to makes sure that the two don't have genetic relations.|`|381d83afcad5cc80b96dedfb0eedf83daa	Yeah sure go ahead buy another from the same store I't doesn't matter. If you get him a friend of course the birds won't be much of a close pet to you because they will be paying attention to eachother. Parakeets a noisy though. Have fun.|`|RhqljZpeaa	I heard that the way that you can tell if it is a boy or a girl is by their noses.  If it is blue or green then it is a boy.  If it is a girl it will have a little bit of brown on their nose.  If you wanna get one because he is lonely you can choose a  boy for a friend or a girl for a mate.|`|7a1a97b05947f9e6367106facb3184c1aa	Why not?  The only concern is if you want to breed them but don't want them to be related.  They won't breed if there is no nest box in their cage.  Best wishes.
AA12245576	I already have a sitter for my little critters... she's called a school teacher. She seems to like to babysit them when i feed them in class. Funny though.... they always seem to come back to us two weeks later and dead.|`|877129f9afb83690c3e31ae56d885b3baa	talk in english!!!!!  no tama's don't need a sitter!!!!!|`|8dc4d383bc1ea016bda19c07cbff6645aa	check your spelling, first of all. But no. Tomagotchis dont need a sitter. just turn them off smarty pants.
oFMb33X8aa	It does not mean that the kitten wont survive, but out of the kittens it will have the hardest time.   Lots of times there is what we call the "runt" of the litter, I have raised sooooo many kittens (friends, neighbors, familily bring to me when they find sick or very young kittens that arent doing so well)  Sometimes if the litter is big (usually 7+) there will be one or two that are weaker and have a harder time latching on to the mothers nipple or get pushed away by the stronger ones.   It is a good idea to keep a close eye on things.   Also sometimes if there is something wrong with the kitten the mother will sometimes separate the kitten from the rest, and yes unfortuneately sometimes will not allow it to feed, and in extreme cases, even kill the kitten herself.  When the kittens are still very young the basically sleep and eat, later they start moving around more, exploring.   How young is this kitten? is its eyes open yet?  Compared to the other kittens, is it as active?  If you are really worried and the kitten seems to be doing poorly with no improvement (dont wait to long if the are under 2 weeks of age a day or two can mean the difference between life and death) there are things that you can do to help the poor thing out..    1)  Go to local grocery/department store in the pet section they have formula made for small kittens, "mothers helper" is a common one.   You can get this in liquid form or powder, I always use the powder because its easier for me and lasts longer and I usually end up with a few kittens every year to nurse back to health.  There is directions on the carton/can of how to mix it with water    2) Buy the bottle for kittens and put the formula in that to feed it, do not feed it upside down just put it on your lap or area that is safe and have it be on all four legs or basically in that position, raise its head a lil to be able to get the bottle in its mouth (sometimes they dont want to open so you go in from the side of the mouth until it gets a grip on the nipple, it may take a few tries because at first some kittens doesnt really realize what the bottle is.  When feeding it (depending on the amount of suction the kitten has) if the nipple or bottle starts to collapse, sort of tilt the nipple to the side for a second to release suction pressure then put back in its mouth)      If the kitten is real young (under 2 weeks)  It is a good thing to feed it every 2 hours (if the mother isnt feeding it at all) Or if the mother is feeding it but it is not getting as much milk as the others you can offer it a bottle a couple times a day and see how it goes.       Sometimes you come across kittens that are to weak to reallly get ahold of the nipple and suck, in that case an eyedropper worked wonders for me.   Make sure you give the right amount of formula, on the back of the can mothers helper or whatever brand of formula you choose there will be directions to how much to give the kitten.    If the mother refused to care for the kitten at all, and the kitten is very young, feed every 2 hours, and also (I know this sounds gross but it helps the poor little thing) after every feeding get a cottonball or tissue damp with warm water and wipe its private area, this stimulates the kitten to go to the bathroom, the mother does this naturally by licking her kittens down there)   So if the mother is refusing, just wipe gently down there for about 10-20 seconds to help stimulate it to use the bathroom.   The first time the vet told me to do this I couldnt believe it, but it worked!      After about 4-5 weeks the kittens chances improve a good deal, each week adds greatly to its chances, the first 7-8 weeks is the tough time, if it survives after that it has a really great chance    *NOTE* if you ever see any kitten have this yellowish thin diarrea take to the vet immediately it has a viral infection and or parasite and they usually prescribe amoxicil for kittens in liquid form, left untreated, they usually die.    Hope this helps, it has worked for me for over 85 kittens  (I have been doing this every since I was 10 =)|`|gOZ79L5Waa	It's pretty normal to have a smaller kitten in a litter. I you are really worried about it though you can go to walmart or a petstore or a vet and buy those little bottles and formula they make for baby animals. The kittens won't drink 24 hours a day, because the mother needs to go eat and use the litterbox, etc. but they do spend a lot of time nursing.|`|34a57c291f9c1ba416922a9cadc97d48aa	Its probably just the runt of the litter and they usually do ok and survive , but if you dont see it drinking at all, then step in and bottle feed it, you can get special cat formula from vets etc...|`|647e8a48ad9fe5f5763a7ce619d1e9ffaa	Yes,their is a way to feed it give it a bottle with milk in it.|`|66e8976b6d841286e506d4ec5394ee46aa	If the litter is 8 or less, and the kitten is feeding, it should be OK.  If you want to try supplemental feeding, a pet store can sell you formula and a bottle, but in most cases, this is not necessary.     Kittens sleep more than anything else for the first few weeks.  They will wake up and feed, play for a few minutes, then go back to sleep.  This is normal.  It is also normal for one to be a bit smaller than the others.  Just provide a clean, warm "nest" for them, and feed the mother well.  She will take care of the kittens.|`|AA10354950	Hello- You can use an eyedropper to feed with. Most stores have milk for kittens in the cat food aisle. When I got Moonie he weighed 1oz. Then you can feed your kitty baby food with a spoon until theyre about 6 weeks old. I had to put him to sleep yesterday,after 11 years of faithful devotion. Warm the milk a little bit & feed every 4-6 hours. I wish you the best of times.

Take them to a vet. May need some allergy shot or some prednisone. My shih tzu is very prone to allergies. She has to get a allergy shot at least every month and the dogs could have allergies. It could be flea allergies. It only takes one flea bite. It's actually the saliva they are allergic too. or could be food allergy. Could be a lot of different allergies. Best to take to the vet and get it taken care of. My shih tzu's allergies got so bad once she scratched till she was raw. So please take her to the vet. Godwilling it's just a simple allergy. They will need a skin scrape to find out exactly if it's a skin allergy or even a skin parasite. Good Luck!!|`|Q1CJGlUOaa	its normal for dogs to scratch and bite, but if its becoming a problem where its causing hair loss or physically making them uncomfortable, talk to your vet. They may have a skin condition.|`|tbw5ND12aa	Absent the fleas and ticks, I would recommend a complete check by the vet as your best approach.  They may have a skin condition that is not evident by just looking. They may have developed an allergy of some sort (just as people can) that causes itching.  Good luck.|`|t46lboAMaa	Some dogs have skin issues. First and foremost if you have any ( even just a few) fleas, get rid of them. Allergies to the environment. Just like people do. Also, a dogs skin is not PH balanced for using human shampoo on. Always use dog shampoo. There is a dog skin medication called sulfadene ( medication & shampoo.) that might help.You can also give dogs small amounts of liquid benedryl for itching. You might speak with a vet. They might offer other alternatives.|`|nx3oHvGcaa	They are probably suicidal!!!!! You should take them to a counciler and have them take to him. That's what I would do.

4de4d91147854dc1591e3ae7e4e5546eaa	I agree that they can have flight time together. My lovebird and parakeet have spend all their out of the cage time together. If I let one out they call to the other one till it comes out.     As long as the birds do not fight or bother one another I do not see a problem with it at all.    The adoption shelter where I got my lovebird even had a Quaker and a parakeet that had to go together because they loved each other. The Quaker knew how to say parakeet's name and would tell it to come here. The birds would go to each others cage and play with toys together. It was the cutest thing.|`|bcca81e3a01eecd371f088c347c05a2aaa	Oh, definitely. While in the cage, you're not always around, which is the purpose of the cage - so they don't get hurt when you can't watch them. Also, when you leave them alone, they could fight in the cage and that can result in death, as well since it's an enclosed space with little "get away from me" space as nature would have, it's riskier.    However, when supervision is involved, I allow all of my birds to interact out of the cage as long as they're behaving. It's great for them because it's social time, free time, time to exercise, and you know they're safe because you're right there with them and watching them.|`|qyS3hc1Zaa	i think they will be fine together i've seen tiels and parakeets share a cage|`|j1Lg22TKaa	what is the most bauitifull bird in the world?|`|fad6c79100222b0b4ae048c370866c9aaa	Not sure on that.  All the budgies we had had their flight time in our house and the canaries were never tame enough to be let out to socialise.  Most of the smaller parrot types I have seen share a cage with budgies with only a few incidences of hen pecking taking place(those were usually the older or more fragile that were removed after such incidences).

nawVCebbaa	"Crusty white stuff" around the nostrils could be one of three things:    1. The skin around the nostrils is starting to peel off.  2.  If you do not rinse your veggies that you get your iggy, it could be a large amount of excess salt that he is blowing out of his nose.  A little bit is pretty normal, but too much salt can cause that problem.  3. Your iggy may have a respiratory problem.  Is he bubbling out of his nose?  If he is eating OK, then this is a least likely problem, but be wary if you begin to notice him eating less and less.  Make sure his envrionment is properly heated.|`|H27auq9Eaa	he is probly shedding around his nose my pet bearded dragon does it all the time.

Iguana will expell undigested salts and other minerals from there nostrils if their body all ready has enough.  However it can also be a respiratory infection.  I would have him checked out by a vet to be on the safe side.      As for the bulging bump.  As long as it is there only after he eats and isn't only always there I wouldn't worry about it.  That would just be him digesting food he just ate.  Iguana's will stuff themselves but when you take him to the vet mention that too..it can't hurt for him to have a full check up.

XixM4H5naa	I have used the 3581 and its excellent.     If your fishes are habituated of getting fed with 2 different types of food, then 3582 is better, but over all, all Eheim are great and I am sticking with this brand for 3 years now.    Nemo|`|8c8d63e519757bfe63547efcc4acc5efaa	It kind of depends on how many fishes and wat type of fishes do u have. If u have a fish that need variety types of food, then u should get the twin feeder. But if u have a fish that only need one type of food, then u should get the 3581 to save money. The three or four times doesn't matter much since most fishes are recommended to eat only 2 or 3 times per day|`|yfQvlIiFaa	i would go with the twin feeder it alows you to feed your fish 2 diferent foods in one day giving them some what of a choice, but it is alot more money and you can only feed your fish 3 times a day while the 3581 can feed your fish up to 4 times a day and it keeps fish food dry and prevents spoilage.

SoPpLXjraa	beh nella lista del ministero dei cani pericolosi il dobermann, non  presente! la mia  buonissima, affettuosissima.. Il vero problema sono questi superlativi!! E' TROPPO affettuosa  TROPPO ossessiva perch vuole SEMPRE stare attaccata a me e famiglia! E' un continuo seguire chiunque di noi si muova in casa, rubare pantofole, bottiglie vuote, ecc... Questo  il vero problema del dobermann! E' superattivo,  troppo appiccicoso,  troppo entusiasta della vita e di tutto cio' che lo circonda! visto cosi', singolarmente, fa ridere.

A partire da un insieme eterogeneo di cani, quest'uomo and man mano a "costruire" gli antenati del futuro Dobermann. In seguito, il suo lavoro venne proseguito dai futuri fondatori del Dobermann Verein (club di razza tedesco), che imposero la loro "creazione" negli anni Trenta, dapprima in Europa e poi anche negli Stati Uniti.  il Dobermann ha fatto il suo ingresso nel nostro secolo nelle vesti di cane dei servizi d'ordine. Se questa immagine  allorigine della sua notoriet altrettanto si pu dire per la sua plastica corporale, che fa oggi di lui un cane che unisce perfettamente eleganza e potenza . In questi ultimi vent'anni, la Germania, che rimane detentrice dello standard e paese di origine della razza, si  vista togliere Lo scettro di mano dagli allevatori olandesi e italiani, che hanno prodotto soggetti di ottima qualit Sono stati privilegiati soggetti atti al lavoro ma eleganti e fieri, come prescrive lo standard.  il Dobermann, in particolare il maschio,  inscrivibile in un quadrato. Fondamentalmente socievole e pacifico, deve tuttavia essere un guardiano efficace e coraggioso, dal carattere forte e sicuro   Il Dobermann  un cane di taglia media, forte e muscoloso. Malgrado la sua "sostanza", si distingue per una silhouette ricca di eleganza e distinzione.   Deve avere tutte le qualit del cane da compagnia, da guardia, da difesa e di famiglia..    secondo me,  solo molto territoriale e ligio alla volont del padrone...se il padrone  una testa di cavolo...sappiamo quli sono i risultati!  ciao|`|d596c10a591320fcbbe9d5563324550eaa	S!|`|f70a1c09a068c6d2079a3dd12321da00aa	i padroni sn pericolosi!  a me  capitato ke un carlino fra un p me stacca un dito! scusami e........... i cani nn sn affatto pericolosi!|`|295eba96857c42be4420e5891f7af6a6aa	Sono pericolosi i padroni perch non li sanno tenere, perch spesso li prendono solo perch "fa moda" ..... in realt appena commette un gesto di troppo sono pronti a farlo sopprimere!|`|k5LxSGgIaa	Le mie esperienze con i doberman sono sempre state positive.

Sometimes nutrient blocks or mouse food lacks some essential nutrients. I feed by mice apples and mango so they get their intake of Vitamin C but i prefer to use the natural stuff rather than supplements. If you have a good petshop near you they should make their own mix and usually this has it's own mix with all the essentials. Careful with mixes though as some mice pick and choose and leave some of the good stuff behind. Just make sure whatever you are feeding them doesn't have too much corn as that's just ruffage that will fill the mice but isn't all that good for them. I don't think B12 supplements are necessary unless the mice are exhibiting signs of B12 lack.|`|bjcf1Up9aa	There shouldnt be any bad affects.

4de4d91147854dc1591e3ae7e4e5546eaa	As you know from owning a lovebird they can be aggressive. So having them in the same cage is a no.    If you have out of the cage time with your birds let them be out together with close supervision.    I also have a parakeet and a lovebird. They LOVE each other. They chirp to one another all day long. They can't wait till I get them out of their cages so they can be together. They play with all the out of the cage toys together. They feed each other and preen one another. They also get some one nippy and you have to watch.    My parakeet has also tried to squeeze out of the cage to get to my lovebird. I was sick and I didn't want to handle my birds or have them out of the cage so they were upset that they could not get to one another so my parakeet figured that he would fix that by trying to squeeze out.    If you have never had your lovebird out try it with him alone. Of course make sure their wings are clipped or you may never be able to stop a fight.     What I was told to do was put a bird in a clean bathtub (not just cleaned with cleaners, but a clean tub). He then has to trust you to get out. Treats work well with that also. My lovebird also loves being held close to my chest and being talked/sang to softly. It has a very calming effect on him.     With my parakeet, he was just an easy trainer. I just handled him so much that he got used to me and could trust me.     With your birds I would not ever put them in the same cage. I have tried that with mine and it causes them to become territoral. That is their space and their space only. Just work on the out of the cage time. Your lovebird is curious of your parakeet and does want to play with him and see him.    Try giving your bird some new things to play with. I know my love bird loves plastic straws (cheap entertainment). Another thing with my lovebird is that he likes little things that he can carry with him like foot toys (you can find them at Petco). So if you do not want to put them together entertain him somehow. I bought what is called a Kozy Konner for my lovebird and he loves it. You get a color close to your bird and they snuggle with it and think it is another bird. So maybe that might take the focus off of the parakeet. You can also get that at Petco or PetsMart.    If I were you I would get them out of the cage together and see what they do. My parakeet is actually meaner to my lovebird. So you never know. Just try it and be ready to intervene. My birds are the best of buds now. Maybe yours can be too. It is the cutest thing ever when they play together, so just try it.|`|b0cc4dc9fb76a8ba638773bdc9a7518caa	the exact thing happened to my sister in law. she has two keets and one lovebird, well she finally let the lovebird into the keets cage and although the lovebird didn't hurt anyone, one of the keets fell in love with the lovebird and started attacking the other keet as well as my sister in law. and then the lovebird who is very hand tame, tried to bite her when she tried to take him out.(both keets are males and lovebird is female) my lovebird likes to go in my keets cage, and play with them some times but i only allow it while im there watching and for short periods of time, my lovie now has a mate and they are all friends, but i still supervise their playtime together.   p.s: my lovies are the sweetes, nicest birds. not aggresive at all.|`|8bd04e8539a619f76b97bd995b60dbb3aa	Lovebirds are by nature curious and aggressive birds.      Undoubtedly he is curious about the other birds, and wants to investigate them closer.  However, because of their tendency towards aggression, you should NOT put them in the same cage.      You are quite correct he could seriously injure or even kill a parakeet, and it would only take one bite to do it.     You can offer them carefully supervised time together on a playgym for birds. Take is slow, no maore than 5 minutes at a time at first.  Watch him carefully for signs of aggression, and don't leave them alone together even for a second.  If all goes well, you can increase their supervised time together slowly until they spend perhaps 20-30 minutes together.    Lovebirds are very active birds who enjoy challenges. Provide lots of stimulating toys with moving parts and things he can chew and shred to help him relieve some of his pent up energy.      You may also want to consider a different cage for him, if he succeded in getting his head stuck once, he'll do it again.  And if he were to do that at night or while you were gone, he could hang himslef before you find him.    He'll probably never stop showing interest in the other birds, but with your careful supervision and attention, he just might make friends with them.    Gale|`|HwZaonVYaa	Sounds like you have a real casanova ! Sounds like he wants a friend to be with but don't try to put them together, one or the other could bite faster than you could react. If the tame? parakeet will come out of his cage on your hand , take him to the Lovebird cage to see casanova, from outside the bars ! { alittle hint..if you clip the wings the parakeet and Lovebird will tend to be easier to tame, when they know they can't fly and no, it's not cruel ! A frieghtened bird can fly into a window or mirror and breaks it's neck. } And you don't know if the Lovebird is a male or female so you wouldn't know if it wanted a guy or girl friend. With parakeets you can at least tell the difference. Proceed carefully.|`|ONLzkkILaa	Your lovebird must be curios.He might not seen them up close and wants to.Sens his aggressive you shouldn't put them together.

ApSySHPvaa	Come tutti gli animali muniti di un manto peloso, anche i cani sono soggetti ai cambi di stagione, cosicch 2 volte all'anno (prima dell'estate e prima dell'inverno) mutano il pelo.  Quello che viene sostituito in realt  il sottopelo (che si presenta come una specie di laniccio grigiastro). Alcuni cani ne perdono in quantit industriale e sarebbe consigliabile aiutarli nello smaltire il pelo in eccesso spazzolandoli giornalmente con le apposite spazzoline. Un metodo per evitare di trovarsi la casa invasa dal laniccio  quello di tosarli, ma ovviamente non con tutti i tipi di cane  possibile questa pratica (vi immaginate un terranova tosato?) :-))|`|81761d1e0330474578b20f116fe9c383aa	Muta stagionale per la crescita del pelo estivo....|`|f70a1c09a068c6d2079a3dd12321da00aa	xk penso ke stanno cambiando il pelo??|`|9fc2cccafdfda83b517f96a762212349aa	Si chiama muta stagionale.

Ma questo per... lo dovrai fare seriamente, molti ragazzi alla fine lasciano il proprio animale ai genitori e non se ne occupano pi anche dopo un'infinit di promesse, quindi, se tu ti senti di occuparti veramente di lui allora non credo che ai tuoi dispiacer prendertene uno!!

9vziaT7jaa	You're doing all you can right now with what you have.  Trouble is it's very difficult without an incubator to keep the right temp. which has to be between 99 and 99.5 constantly. Also they need to be turned a minimum of 3 times/day.  Even if it got cold for a few hours, it can still be alive and continue to grow.  Hope you can find someone with an incubator or a wildlife rehabber.  Also check with your local vet or avian vet to see if they know someone with an incubator that could take it.|`|fMd5xjHAaa	You are doing all that can be done, but without and incubator it's doubtfull it will hatch. you will ned to turn it frequantly and you may be lucky and hatch it out if it was very close to hatching when you found it.    If you are lucky and it hatches you are faced with another problem--is it a seed eating, fruit eating or insect eating bird, what will you feed the chick? If you feed it the wrong food formular because you don't know what sort of bird it is you can kill it. It's sometimes difficult to tell what sort of bird a tiny chick belongs too.|`|TkqY6dZ6aa	the method you are using to heat the egg is how birds are hatched with birth defect. you can not apply uneven heat to an egg and expect it to incubate properly.  Please just throw the egg away.  The baby is either dead or its just an egg. If you eat anything with chicken egg then this egg isnt any different.|`|aw0jtlnNaa	the bird is most likely to be dead. Could have been there for days, even if it wasnt there long, as soon as it goes cold, the bird dies. Upto you if you want to carry on trying,u never know it could hatch. Hopefully it does. Good luck|`|y5UqBPBBaa	place it back in the nest if you can find a nest near where you found it if not and it hatches be prepared to feed it
5IoIhn44aa	Di tutte e due le cose.  Da una parte ci sono padroni che non sanno trattare nel giusto modo i loro animali, rispettando la loro natura.  Dall'altra ci sono razze che troppo spesso vengono create considerando il solo lato estetico senza considerazione ne per la salute degli animali (vedi i problemi respiratori di alcune razze), ne i cambiamenti a livello di comportamento (essendo l'organismo un sistema integrato di parti non si pu pretendere di cambiare il colore degli occhi di una razza senza influire ad es sulla sua predisposizione all'aggressivit... - un esempio- ).  In tutti i casi di aggressione ci sono sempre, da una parte un approccio sbagliato da parte della vittima o di qualcuno vicino nei confronti dell'animale, e dall'altra un animale che mette in mostra display comportamentali (come l'attacco al viso o alla gola) che sarebbe meglio non selezionare o tenere in considerazione quando si mette una nuova razza sul mercato.  Ciao    x chi dice, come Ollydolly, Erica, Lime, Hembra, che  colpa dei padroni andassero a vedere dove i cani (che sono Carnivori, famiglia Canidae) attaccano le vittime. Valga per loro la considerazione fatta Rosalita e anche da qualcun altro: non si pu allevare una tigre o un leone, per quanto amore tu gli possa dare, e pensare che non manifestino comportamenti che rispecchiano la loro natura. Il cane discende dal lupo, non bisogna mai dimenticarlo.  (e per inciso io amo gli animali, sono Biologo, ma ho studiato anche Etologia...)|`|VVKJdTTBaa	secondo me dipende molto da come sono allevati...|`|czA68SUTaa	 colpa dei padroni...i cuccioli sono some delle pagine bianche da scrivere...a seconda di qualle ke vi viene scritto il cucciolo reagisce...e cos fara x il resto della sua vita!|`|yf0IU0FJaa	credo prorpio che siano i padroni ad avere tutta la colpa dei comportamenti dei sloro cani!non esistono cani violenti, cattivi o "mangia-bambini", esistono persone che non sanno come si educano i cani e che molto spesso li piacchiano! poveri cani, che colpa ne hanno loro?|`|1500nrzGaa	per me c'entra soprattutto il modo in cui si alleva un cane non credo che i cani siano cattivi di natura anzi...forse a volte sono pi pericolosi gli uomini che gli animali|`|40bOEFjFaa	Credo che la maggior parte dei casi, sia colpa dei padroni che non sanno allevare il proprio cucciolo.Loro sono come di bambini hanno bisogno di una buona educazione. Non dimentichiamo per che ci sono cani, come i molossoidi che sono molto partcolari, in quanto sono aggressivi di natura.|`|eVyGzWHkaa	io ho sempre pensato che alcune persone sono totalmente stupide e da qui ecco il cane aggressivo.  La gente non si rende conto che se le razze vengono catalogate un motivo ci sar...perch il cocker  cane da compagnia mentre il pitbull da difesa? Non troverete mai un Rotwailer nella sezione seguci....ci sar un perch no?  Quando si sceglie un cane si pensa solo all'estetica dell'animale,certo  pi figo girare con un pitbull anzich con un barboncino, senza pensare che se si prende un cane da difesa bisogna avere la competenza e le capacit di tirarlo su come si deve, visto che queste razze oltre ad essere intelligentissimi e dolci hanno una naturale (o artefatta dal'uomo)propensione a difendere il loro territorio o il loro padrone in maniera a volte spropositata se non gli vengono insegnati i limiti ai quali sottostare. Quindi bisognerebbe capire a priori se si  in grado di avere il controllo di certi cani, se si  capaci di far seguire delle regole altrimenti bisognerebbe prendere un pesciolino rosso e non causare danni alle persone! La razza che io adoro  il Rotwailer ma non ne ho mai avuti perch so di non essere adatta e di non sapermi imporre come capobranco quindi ho solo cani da compagnia per evitare cos di rovinare un cane cos meraviglioso solo per accontentare i miei gusti estetici... quello che dovrebbero fare in molti secondo me.|`|fd51f0ad60921943088528be1586a2a4aa	io credo di pi ai padroni pericolosi.|`|9c3b67b6a39513398bb9626af7dc1c82aa	la colpa  sempre dei padroni.la gente non ha la benche minima consapevolezza che le sue azione vengono sempre interpretate dal cane.oggi ero fuori con il mio cucciolone che sta  iniziando a conoscere altri cani giocava tranquillo con loro finche arriva una signora con un labrador (can docilissimo) lui fa per annusare il mio cane e la "genia" inizia a tirarlo per il guinzaglio...vuoi per il dolore che gli ha provocato vuoi perche lo strattonamento lo ha interpretato come se avrebbe trovato un pericolo se avesse continuato ad avvicinarsi al mio cane..insomma,ha iniziato a ringhiare e se non fossi intervenuta acchiappando il mio gli avrebbe morso.|`|sfVfNwMhaa	Certo  anche colpa dei padroni (alcuni sono veramente dei delinquenti) ma sono convinta che alcune razze siano particolarmente pericolose e non andrebbero tenute tranquillamente in giardino come fossero dei cocker....  E smettiamola con questo buonismo di considerare i cani come fossero persone! Sono animali e come tali (giustamente) hanno i loro istinti, non possono ragionare con la logica!!!  E' come se pretendesimo di tenere cuccioli di tigre o di leone nel giardino di casa! Non possiamo aspettarci che si comportino come dei gattini. Anche se li alleviamo con tutto l'amore di cui siamo capaci restano sempre dei felini pericolosi.  E' lo stesso con i cani. Alcune razze sono pericolose a prescindere. Anche se sono allevati con amore.|`|FwmcrNj0aa	i cani devono andare in giro con la museruola!!!|`|406a7959d41514c6e3edcec5ca1390c1aa	dietro al cane pericoloso c' un padrone che lo ha allevato per esserlo|`|Uk4sDb5Iaa	secondo me la colpa  della moda se una razza  molto richiesta arrivano animali dal estero mal selezionati e malati che vengono tolti dalle madri quando hanno un giorno e con problemi di carattere se poi ci si aggiunge un proprietario inesperto  ancora peggio.
4PCRX4sUaa	don't waste your money getting this strange cat fixed: if s/he has already started spraying then it has become a learned habit and will continue even after s/he becomes spayed or neutered (some of the misunderstandings about cats and spraying-both male and females can spray, also, fixing them won't stop them if they've already started) besides-it might be someone's pet and you just don't know it!  I would try buying some of the scented repellent sprays from your local pet store...they hate the smell of vinegar and of oranges; hope this helps!|`|N6AlMfJgaa	get him neutered|`|JrnXCy49aa	If it's a stray, there are two options. You can either take the animal in yourself and have it fixed, or you can call Animal Shelter, but until it is fixed, there's no stopping it, I'm afraid.|`|BMzzpaEDaa	Take him/her to a local animal shelter and get him/her neutered/spayed.|`|JJiwMVpPaa	at garden stores they sell pecan shells and some mixture that smells strange but not in a bad way sorta like peppermint... the pecan shells are very pretty. trust me it works|`|bOFqwmAZaa	You should get it fixed because that's the only way it'll stop.|`|IQD3DTbGaa	Nuetered is one way. Another way that is very effective is the water bottle. You know, the kinds with the knozzle that spray out a light mist. Everytime you see him spray, squirt him. Eventually he'll release that to stop getting water sprayed on him, he needs to stop marking his terriotry. This however takes awhile.|`|Vxbywa0maa	Cats also hate the smell of moth balls, but this is a big open area (or appears by description) Maybe you could get some orange spray or orange deodorizer. The smell should make him not want to go there if it doesn't dissipate too soon.|`|be9cc9ed0ae71a8ec822717130b0b6f8aa	get a tattle tale alarm every time an animal pees it send of an alarm you can buy them a pets-mart|`|AA10512580	I agree, you need to get the cat nuetered or spayed in order to stop this.  Spring time is the worse.  Cats are the most in heat during this time.
92fa731fe37a4b568b5a116f268c2a35aa	Cat scratches are fixable but you will need a colour matched from a swatch of leather.    LTT do a colour matching service and send instructions for dealing with cat scratches ( a specific technique is required).|`|gH4NNyBZaa	hmmm...  i don't think it could be fixed.  was it that bad?|`|AA10901357	my couch asks me the same thing...|`|7c454077f04dbfc38ec1ac370b195188aa	Do a google search for Leather Repair Kit and you'll find your remedy.  All you need to do is match up the color and apply.  I remember a liquid repair kit "as seen on TV" a while back where you put the stuff on..covered it and ironed and it completely fixed it leaving no signs of damage at all.  It supposedly even fixed tears and cuts all the way thru. But there are all kinds of kits to fix leather.  Even in auto parts stores to fix car seat leather!

Your dog is not a fish.|`|fqiwCpx9aa	take your dog around the house on a leash show them the house as you would anyone else.|`|jvNzSneGaa	I have had alot of experience in this considering all the animals i have and not just dogs.     I used to live in Pennsylvania but i recently moved many states over. My animals were all crated and i know they hated it but the got used to it. When we got there all the animals were getting into fights because they were unsure of the area. What i did was give them some space away from me and anyone else in the house. They looked around sniffed around and they relaxed. I also put toys and everything out and just tried to get them used to it.    The best advice i can give you is to try to give him or her some space. Set up a play area or just throw toys all around, if your dog falls asleep it is a good sign because they are relaxed. If your dog does not eat or drink it is not and you will have to try something else.    I hope this helps, and if you need anymore help with what to do with your dog let me know!

A volte non hanno un bricciolo di testa e di cuore verso i loro amici a quattro zampe.  Loro non c'entrano nulla e quindi non e' giusto in estate l'asciarli soli.  Se prorpio bisogna arrivare a questo punto allora e' innutile prendersi un animale in casa.  Io devo trovare qualcuno che  mi curi il mio caro  coniglietto nano. L'hanno scorso ero in vacanza con lui ,ma questanno non me lo posso portare.  sentiro' i miei se me lo tengono per due setimane.  Ho letto una storia che qualcuno a scitto qui di un povero cagnolino che fino a poco prima delle vacanze tutti gli volevano bene e poi lo hanno lasciato solo.   aprorpio come dicevi tu.

Your old enough to use the phone, look up Dog obedience schools or self train the dog yourself. All it takes is a commitment.|`|1vAmd3Diaa	nope , as long as you let them know how is the bose you good to go|`|cmlXEKoiaa	i have a german shepherd right now... he is 5 months old. and i can't say if it's hard or not.. i guess seeing him learn so fast is relieving and fun.. i think having any breed would just be the same, it's about the commitment in training and stuff.    based on my exp. GERMAN SHEPHERDS  ---learns fast  ---very gentle, likes licking my hand  ---are good companion(get ready, cause he will follow you around! haha) it's very cute... if you want it that way  ---very active(prepare to accumulate his energy everyday by walking or any exercise)  ---loves to impress their owner(by doing commands)  ---likes being touch(socialization is the secret)  ---needs work(in the farm, herding, if in the city... buy him a dog backpack to carry your things.. hehe, that would be enough replacement)    to cut it short... he is intelligent and loves being with his owner or any companion.. don't live him alone too much without anyone to see.. their simly cute and compassionate... great dogs.

c86dbc2b36eaa731e183bf99872a73f2aa	I would say to get a scratching post for this cat. Spray catnip spray on it, put a few treats on the very top of the post. Show the cat the post, and guide him up to the treats. That way, you are showing him how to dig on the post. As far as the wallpaper goes, ugh! There are repellents that are sold in pet stores. They come in different brands but are just about all of the same. Spray the repellent around the areas where kitty is scratching the walls. It will keep him away as the scent is something that will deter him from going there. The repellents have to be sprayed every 24 hours or they lose their scent and it won't work. Get a spray bottle and fill it with water, put the nozzle on stream and squirt the cat in the face when you see it going for the walls. Cats hate water in the face. It might be a good idea to keep the door to that room closed at all times so kitty can't get in there any more. If you go with a post, put it in a different room.    Hope this helps!|`|GAybqLiSaa	a scratching post should do, my kitten's breeder had a leather couch for years untouched with like dozens of cats/kittens everywhere and she said the scratching post solved it|`|cca354c45210c070973887c85f9adec1aa	use a pet deterrent spray|`|kvusmgG7aa	It's their basic instinct to scratch , to mark their territory and the polish their claws .

Do some research yourself, go to dog sites, do searches on temperament, shedding, size, look at prices if that's a factor.     these are choices you have to make, the dog is going to live with you, not me, there are a lot of beautiful dogs out there that I wouldn't own for one reason or another. .

AA11736483	Yes, you're right, ringworm is not actually a worm, but a fungus growth, kind of like athletes foot or yeast infection like some women get.

RXI8ImdIaa	Have you taken her to the vet? There are some diagnostics tests to run, to see if something is wrong with her health. Often times with cats and dogs, the only symptoms will be behavioral. Kitty can't tell you she has a kidney infection or whatever, she just gets mean.    If it's really just behavioral, they can prescribe anti-depressants. You can also get pheromone diffusers (kinda like glade plug ins) that are supposed to help calm them down. Don't jump straight to the diffusers without talking to a vet though, because I'll bet she is actually sick.|`|4S6V4sb4aa	I'm not sure about females but i do know if you get a male neutered he will chill out..|`|MkE2kO1iaa	If it is a boy cat many boy cats are aggressive while they are young, then they will mellow out as they get older.

k5KuYkkKaa	This is part of an article from the site below.    You certainly don't want them to be eaten by the mother or father hamster, which can and does happen. So you need to take some action, or rather inaction to prevent this. I say inaction because the single most imprtant factor in your hamster parents not eating the babies is for you not to "contaminate" them with your human scent. Particularly if it is the parent hamsters first litter, when they get very anxious and protective and would rather eat the babies than leave them to the fate of a perceived predator i.e. you!  http://hubpages.com/hub/Your-Hamster-Jus...|`|yAlyAt8Zaa	No. If the mother of the baby hamster sees this, then she will take the baby somewhere in the cage that you cant get to. Then she will pic up the baby hamster with her mouth. This will lead to the mother EATING the baby. Just let the little baby be until it gets about 8 weeks. This way you are sure nothing will happen.     I hope this was what you were looking for!|`|UtYOwE4Laa	it depends on how old they are. i really wouldn't do it.|`|m3iPgBWFaa	don't hold them yet they r too little!!!! wait until they get older.... better safe then sorry!|`|IA5SuFkdaa	all mother animals will always be protective about their young, i wouldnt hold it just yet and i would put babies the mom tries to eat in a different cage just to be safe|`|w4ZY0MKWaa	no don't hold them or the mother will disown them|`|WCFp0ODKaa	I would not hold the baby the hamster may trust u but usually animal instincts will override trust in time such being a new parent|`|gdY0yPiAaa	wait a couple of days|`|wUaMEwSsaa	just wait... no matter how bad u wanna hold them  it is for there safety. dont risk there life  because u dont need to  =]|`|FXe5Lv9eaa	Wait until they grow a little. Their immune system is down, and they could catch a cold from you. Do not hold them yet.|`|OaniQuqpaa	why the hell would the mom hamster eat the baby one that you hold|`|fGwZMglGaa	She probably doesn't like being put in her ball because she will not like being seperated from her babies. Don't put her in her ball. Hold it up to the cage and see if she climbs into it. She doesn't want you holding her because she doesn't know where you are taking her or what you are going to do with the babies. Let herstay with them and don't try to hold her.  You can start holding the babies when they eat for themselves because then they no longer rely on their mother. Some people say you can hold them before that but better safe than sorry!  Good luck with the aorable hamsters. I know how you feel wanting to hold them my rabbit just had babies and they are 2 weeks old now with all this fluffy fur and sticky up ears and theyre so titchy!|`|nQLtGEEgaa	U should b able ta hold them, but b careful!!

Wait a few weeks or a month until the babies get bigger. Because mom hamsters can get pretty territorial. So, if you hold her baby, she might get mad and eat it. so just wait a little while.
X1LlP5KPaa	NO.  Rats will kill other rodents.  They are omnivores and naturally feel inclines to attack other animals smaller than themselves.      Oh, here goes again: And by the way, both rats and gerbils are social creatures.  Your rat NEEDS another rat friend.  They are miserable alone.  It does not matter how many hours a day you spend with it, if it is alone, it will not be happy.  Gerbils also need a companion just not as desperately as your poor rat.  They are naturally group animals as well.  Please do research on animals before you get them.    And again:  If you did not know this, then please be aware that you need to spend at least an hour a day with your rat in a rat-safe room for it to run around and actually enjoy itself not cooped up in a cage (this is not optional).  Rats need to be fed fresh fruits, vegetables, and grains daily (not pet store food, it is absolutely terrible for them).  They need to be housed in a large, wire, multilevel cage.  http://www.rattycorner.com/odds/calc.sht...

I mean LITERALLY, what do YOU think?     Different scent + Different scent = Fighting!

jpqt4KEhaa	Well I wouldn't say that she doesn't think you are the leader but its pretty close. If she respected you are a leader she would keep up with you with her head just about at your shoulder she will lag a little and when you stop she will get ahead but she should adjust quickly. I would say that the ear pinning isn't really a lack of respect because you are asking her to trot and she doesn't want to so she is going to show that in some was but the head tossing is what concerns me.   I would spend some time on a lunge lind making her feet move and if you have the option use a round pen to establish that when you say feet move that means they move no matter what with no attitude.    Although I am going to say that the one exception to all of this is if she horse hasn't had much training a green horse they will show attitude until they learn better.    A few ways that they will show that they respect you are that they will trust you in every situation. Here is a video of my horse she is 8 and was unbroke when I got her as a 6 year old she didn't even no how to lead. Toward the end is out liberty work and as you can see she is always focused on me. What you cant hear or see in the video is that my husband was behind the pen with a bull dozer fixing a drainage problem and building behind us has stuff being tossed out as my friend was cleaning out the tack room.      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iOIZ1wrW...    To test how much your horse thinks of you as the boss set up obsticles like cones and back her throught them, get a giant ball and ask her to back into it walk into it. Hang a old ripped up tarp up in on on the gates and ask her to walk through it many times until she does it slowly and controled, lunge her through water, make a bridge or a deack and ask her to hop on and off it when you say.  Hope that helps|`|NApGmuHdaa	As what other people have said she may be made but she also might be trying to play with you (as horses do with each other in the paddock) which means she may see you as a friend not as the leader. She does trust you because she follows you around and if she didn't like you she would not want to be round you e.g. she would head in the other direction.     A horse that shows respect would keep its distance from the owner/ its leader it would not try and play with the leader because the leader is in charge and it would not want to annoy it. (unless the horse is very stupid!!!) I don't think your pony really sees you as a leader, I think it sees you as a friend - a playmate. This is lovely but yes unfortunately it can get dangerous as your pony is way stronger than you and could potentially hurt you whilst trying to play. Also if your horse sees you as a leader they would listen to commands and when you stop they will stop a few feet behind you to keep their distance and then you can approach them not the other way around.     Oh and your pony is so cute!!!!!!!!!|`|IMPvzBk1aa	The main indicator of respect is that the horse never enters your space uninvited.  This means that even in the pasture, but also when being led, or anywhere else, the horse comes no closer to you than about 3 to 4 feet away.  My horses are led on at least 3 feet of lead, and stay that distance away from me.  If I stop, they stop.  If I change direction, they will back up and turn if that is what they have to do to stay out of my space.  If I walk toward them, they will back away.  This is one of the first things I train a horse as a foundation for respect, and establishing my place as the leader in the pecking order.|`|FX8bCgoyaa	pinning ears back mean aggressive her ears were pinned way back it also looked like she wanted to bite you by stretching out her neck and just trying to chase you away.    EDIT: You will know when your horse respects you if she doesn't try to walk ahead of you while leading her, never shows signs of aggressive behavior and respecting your space there are more to.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	She definitely knows your the boss. Her ears pinned and her throwing her head are ways of her showing shes mad and maybe a bit agressive but she still knows whose boss. Her following you is definitely a sign that she sees you as the pack leader. A horse knows your the boss when they listen and dont act up. Lowering their head and licking are also signs of submission.|`|Pn9tPYKbaa	ears pinned back is a sign of anger. you prolly did something out of the middle of nowhere that you didnt know about and made her mad. her doing that thing with her head, also mad. you running was showing her she was the leader of the herd, and you were part of HER heard, when you should be the leader.  my horse moves out of the way for me out of a sign of respect. she trust me. your horse does not see you as the leader right now. some things you can do are when you ride her, if she does one thing you dont want her to do, you correct it,so she doesnt think she is leading you.  you are the leader, remember that. show them some respect, and they will show you some. hope i helped. BTW, her shaking her head and chasing was not out of respet or trust, it was her showing you she is the leader, when you should be showing her you are the leader|`|suTye2m2aa	If you are interested in doing more ground work and learning to have a good relationship with you're horse, I STRONGLY suggest looking into Parelli training. Learning what they call "the seven games" to play with your horse was the best thing I ever did with my horse.   Just go to their website or check out a book about Parelli training. Trust me, you will love it. You don't have to spend a bunch of money either, all you really need is a lunge line and maybe what they call a 'carrot stick'. You'll learn all sorts of ways to get your horse to respect you and to really bond and strengthen your relationship. It's alot of fun.     Hope I helped. :)
Uy9xmYCvaa	Well, I was going to Volleyball practice when my mom pulled over and told me to try to grab a turtle on the road. There was a car getting close so my mom told me to stay back, the first car missed the turtle and so did the second car, but the third car purposely hit the poor turtle. The reason I say purposely is because the turtle was in a place that could have easily been missed.  I remember hearing the shell pop and crying, I also remember being really mad at that driver.  Now I did go through a horrible death yesterday, My angel fish named Dark Tiger died     ~AtA~|`|Xrvutzmdaa	yea my bird died in my hands it was intense and sad i cried|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Yes, I've witnessed many of my pet birds die.  The last one I saw die was my zebra finch Hudson.  He was laying in his cage and stretched out his legs and stopped breathing.  His death was unexpected and very sad.  I buried him near my birdfeeder in my yard.  I thought that would be a nice spot for him.      Crows are very intelligent birds.  Actually, all birds are very smart.  There is no such thing as a "bird brain" or stupid bird.|`|1d3e58ddc48d93186e5cebea8662a948aa	Yes, small  birds have crashed in my windows and a couple of them have died in my hands. I say a little mantra (according to my beliefs) and deposit their bodies in a safe place, away from cats or dogs. Also, a dog of mine died many years ago right in front of my, and I had to put down to sleep my beloved 13-yr old cat just a couple of weeks ago. She died in my arms, with my husband right beside me. While the anesthesics used for putting her down were taking effect, we told her everything was fine, she was only going to a nice place, so she shouldn't be afraid.  All life is precious, and animals deserve a safe and quiet death, just as much as  you or me.|`|7L0PFTXKaa	Yes.  I watched a man die.  There was a terrible accident--and the father died.  I heard the daughter's screams and cries--I still do hear them in my dreams.  I still see the father's dead body, and the daughter being pulled away from him by the paramedics.    It's something I never want to forget, but it's something that I never want to see again.|`|2bZMxMitaa	I had two budgies that were very old and they were a bonded pair which basically meant they were in love. Gwen and Buddie. Gwen died and I walked over to the cage and saw her laying there dead and then all of a sudden Buddie dropped dead and as he fell off his perch his wing came outward and landed over her, like she was in his arm..Well, wing, rather.  It was the most romantic/tragic thing I ever saw...And it made me wonder if humans could love each other like that. If we could love our mate forever and stay in love. I mean, I see old married couples that fight all the time never hug each other. just makes me abit sad.|`|M9KUiTOAaa	I had a little pet dog that was hit by a car and he died in my arms on the way to the vet hospital..this is a very sad subject..|`|2HbnKuffaa	That's really sad. I have gone through that, too. Once with my grandfather when I was around 8. He was suffering from three different types of cancer, and they only managed to catch two in time. It was the most horrifying thing I have ever had to witness, even 11 years later. He couldn't move or speak or anything.    I did watch a bird die, too. It had an injured wing and so I picked it up, hoping to call a vet or something. It died in my arms. :( Birds are very prone to heart attacks.|`|4SQx8smEaa	Last week I watched my rat take his last breath, I was petting him and making him feel comfortable 1 minutes before he died, then I decided to give him space since he was attempting to crawl into is little house. It is the worst thing to ever have to watch.  And a few years ago my kitten Egypt was running wildly around the house so I picked her up and she started have a seizure she practically died in my arms.    I am all teared up right now|`|EcKLqBnCaa	I've seen my cat die. She was probably only 2 years old at the time. I had to take her to an animal shelter because I couldn't afford to take care of her anymore. I had the car window open a bit because it was hot, and she climbed out of my arms and jumped out. When my mom pulled over, I ran to her. She was alive, but wobbling around like she was dizzy. I picked her up and took her back to the truck. The poor girl died in my arms, I guess she got a concussion since nothing on her looked broken. Whenever I think about this day, I can't help but cry. She was a wonderful cat.|`|c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	Well, I've seen lots of bugs die in my life.

It was sad.|`|ecf159d9c2d48432e189d0cac81882e2aa	A very special horse in my life, the horse I learned to ride on in fact, died right in front of me. She was actually put to sleep on October 18, 2008. It's still extremely hard for me, she was part of my life for a very long time.     My riding instructor, and the owner of the barn I keep my horses at was out of town and I went to feed the horses that morning and I could tell something was wrong with her. I was there from around 7:30am to 5:30pm with the vet and a close friend who also learned to ride on her - finally the vet said she ruptured something and the best thing was to put her down because of her age. :(
B6zl0AJDaa	I started my horses going bridleless by after a usual work, "throwing" my horse away (leaving reins on horn) and then teaching the horse to work off just my legs and weight.  Once they got that down pat at a walk then I moved them on to the other gaits and by the time I finish, they can work with just a rein around their necks at all gaits.  This is VERY valuable when selling a horse.|`|cGRyDCpQaa	When you ride a horse bridleless (without a halter as well) you control the horse with your body aids. How to correctly teach a horse how to respond well to those aids is way too long/complex to type out on here right now, but any well trained riding horse should know them - whether in a bridle or not.    Yikes. That's why I watermark my horse pictures.    + You can watermark pictures in editing programs such as paint shop pro and photoshop. Google has a lot of tutorials on them.|`|eXDDODfHaa	we sometimes we do but we tie a lead rope around the halter.   but we dont go on long rides.  its more like just leting them eat.  sometimes i get on them and just sit on them when they are eating.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Hmmm...shes definitely not for sale. And how the H*LL did people get them pics?    What craigslist was it?      EDIT***  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!    EDIT** THANKS!|`|jpqt4KEhaa	Well I use a shoe string around the neck as my balance helper, because when ever I do bridless I am usually bareback. It comes from mostly having a great bond and your horse reading your seat and body language. If I stop riding meaning sit hard in my seat my horse stops, I also use voice commands, But only walk trot whoa back and canter not like right left. Backing is the hardest thing to get with out any head gear because you have no way of pulling them into the first step but if you go the same body language and words each time with a bridle they pick it up rather quickly. I use cones and try to see how much control I have by getting my horse to go through a pattern with out any head gear.     I don't think that when people say Bridless riding they mean that they have a halter on or are out in the pasture sittong on the horse I mean I guess they could but I think that they mean going through two or more gaits with out head gear of anykind.|`|rsp33Aysaa	you definetly have to have a strong bond, or at least a horse who responds well to other ques.  Riding bridleless would be actually riding, like doing changes of gait or direction, not just sitting on your horse in a field.|`|VmZKZjP1aa	It's not really a good idea to go trail riding bridelless. Even the best trained horse spooks or can be stubborn. Most "bridelless" is for in an arena for specialty show.     But it's a good skill for your horse to have. I teach my horses leg leading. You start by every time you turn you put pressure with the outside leg. (if your turning right, you put pressure with your left leg). Then stopping you teach them by voice commands. Most people who compete in reining do this. If you are consistent and do it EVERY time, they will pick up on it. I had one who was really good at it, but I still kept reins on him.     Good luck|`|EQ2eS4CBaa	Ok, I ride my horse bridle less, and she loves it, of course i've known her since she was two, but that doesn't matter. You have to gain your horse's trust. It's not just about going out there and sitting on your horse, it's about making your horse move with you. Having your horse move when you move, ever hear that song.... When i Move You Move? Good exp. Bridle less riding is all about balance. If you want your horse to turn right, exaggerate your right movement in the saddle, lean with your horse when you turn them. Same if you want them to back up, you lean back, but exaggerate your movements, then, from a bridle, go to a halter pretty, soon they won't need anything but you on them to move.|`|pS8A05NTaa	i taught my mustang to ride bridle less. all i used were leg signals until she responded mostly to them, then gradually stopped using the bridle    she was also really good tempered. when she needed correction, i used the mane|`|USt4MZSBaa	well i have seen it done before, you remove the bridal and hold on the mane to steer.

8EyDsAt6aa	It's definitely not okay to give your guinea pigs grass outside because you never know what kind of bacteria, fungus, mites, microscopic bugs mite be crawling all over it. I recommend Oxbro Western Timothy Hay because they love it and its what most vets recommend anyway. I normally get the biggest bag they have at pets mart. Its like 40 oz and lasts a week and a half to 2 weeks for both of my piggies and i just give them two huge handfuls of it 3 times a day. Its about 10.99 at petsmart. and if you buy a bag of it every 2 weeks its worth it for the health and life of your guinea pig. If you cant afford it then you should seriously reconsider having a guinea pig in the first place if you cant afford to feed it the right food.|`|SzfSeqplaa	I think it is allright. You can search for pet food and you will see all the rates online.|`|xQtnTKCAaa	my friend had guinea pigs and during the day they put the top part of the cage outside so that they can eat the grass. they have never gotten sick. just make sure there is no pesticide stuff i guess.|`|66jX06Onaa	We used to grow grass in the house for our guinea pigs - it was fun in the winter months in Michigan (but it takes quite a while to grow a crop of grass) We never gave them timothy hay.    If you want to get grass from outside, it's okay but ONLY if you are sure it doesn't have fertilizer on it! They really like the clover that grows in with the grass too.|`|Bm9x9ydxaa	I'm sure there is nothing wrong with them eating grass.|`|3sB49YNnaa	You can feed grass, as long as it is pesticide free and clean from animal residue, in addition to BUT NOT as a substitute for grass hay.    You do not need to feed timothy, any good clean grass hay (except fescue) is fine.  You do not need to get it from a pet store or in a bag.  It is MUCH cheaper from a feed store.  Pet stores charge what the traffic will bear, which is a fair bit since most people are feeding one or 2 animals and figure "what the heck"  Feed stores have to price their goods so that people with lots of animals will buy their stuff.  Lots of them sell a small, very compressed bale which you can open and store in a big (clean, new) garbage can or leaf and lawn bags.  We buy 100 lb bails of Coastal Bermuda but that would be overkill for you :-)|`|1bRRODd2aa	Absolutely, fresh greens are MUCH better for your Guinea Pig than any hay.    Make sure the grass is freshly cut, even better let your Guinea Pig eat it straight off the stalks...    One point, make sure that the grass is pesticide, chemical and pollutant free.  Remember that winter grass has almost no nutritional value.  Always provide your Guinea Pig with hay at night.|`|ayuXh7ZLaa	Yes, it is fine as long as the grass is well after its been planted and it isn't near the road our places like that.|`|8NQyi9W2aa	I don't know but I think it's ok. Just make sure you clean it first.|`|XGOtQp6zaa	timothy hay does not cost alot. u can also get him alfalfa. if you feed him regular grass he might get really sick
SytfXV6Haa	An important thing you left out is whether or not you have others cats or animals in the home. If it's just humans you want to make sure that you have a room or a part of a room set up for the new cat so that it feels comfortable and homey to him. A new cat will eventually want to explore its new surroundings, but it may be fearful or scared of the new change in environment. You'll want to make sure that you are also spending time with him in this room/spot playing with him and allowing him to explore you on his terms. Don't force it to do something or it will add on to its fear of the new surroundings As soon as the kitty is comfortable with you and the house you can start to spread things out and incorporate him throughout the house. Like extra litter boxes, toys, food bowls.     If you already have other cats you should keep them seperated at first. Again, make a room/spot just for this new cat so that it will feel comfortable and that something is his. But make sure it's in a spot that the other cats can't gang up or bother it. You'll need to slowly introduce the new cat to the older cat(s). This can first be done by having the cats sniff each other under the door to your room. Eventually you can also do this by having one cat in a cat carrier and having the new one explore around the carrier. This will help both cats to get to know the others scents, sounds and visual appearance. You should also feed them in separate bowls, and if possible, have separate litter boxes. As the cats come to recognize each other you can work on having their food bowls in the same room and eventually side by side.|`|nvWvOyl6aa	as long as you dont have any other animals, then just leave her around so she can discover your house and sniff around and get fammilier with... oh and make sure you let her/him know where her food, water and litter box is.    hope this helped|`|Vc7DrBXxaa	well, first off, u should (if u have other pets) keeps ur other pets away from the new cat. also u should never pay more attention to ur new cat cuz ur other pets may become jelous and who knows wat may happen 2 ur cat then...bum-bum-buuuuum!|`|XWAC1ohfaa	at her own pace, just show her food and litter, then as long as there isn;t any other animals it shouldn't take more then a few hours really.... my new kitten was within hours and there is 2 other cats here|`|5kjYFb9Taa	You just got to set them free in the house and let her roam around.

I have said for years that it is not much better (for animals) than dog or rooster fighting, yet those are outlawed & fought against strongly.

The horse must pass the vets the morning before the race to prove that they are physically sound (you can't even soak their legs in ice beforehand anymore).  They are also blood and urine tested at the completion of the race if they win or have their number drawn.  Thoroughbreds are not allowed to race with any drugs in their system (penicillin alone voids a horse for thirty days of racing).  My horses ran because they loved it and it was in their blood.  Training and racing a horse that can not win is simply flushing money down the toilet.  The whip is used to give commands when there are no riders' legs to do so (did you know that a racehorse will change leads if you tap them on the shoulder?)  The jockeys are heavily fined for inappropriate use of it.    Please look more carefully into what you are saying before you continue.|`|AA10072754	i dont see whats wrong with the racing itself.  Unlike greyhound racing...these horses do get to go back to a ranch instead of getting automatically put to sleep after they retire|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	"Unlike greyhound racing...these horses do get to go back to a ranch instead of getting automatically put to sleep after they retire "    There is where you are wrong. Horses, like greyhounds in some parts are put to sleep once an injury occurs where there will not be a profit from the horse. It isn't the horses you hear Nationally winning titles for the Derby. It is localized or even statewide horses that are not too well publicized who do go to auction, where a good chunk of the crowed is buying to sell to slaughter. They are masked as what the OP said to help cover up any injury the horse has. Horses are given a "B calm" on some occasion.    Horse racing is a profit. To which has its own world of crime and inhumane events.     There is good jockys, there is good trainers. There is good facilities to take the horses after retirement of age 4-6 years of age. I have my mare who is race track blood line and a TB who is a retired TB at the age of 4 with blown knee's and respitory problems.     However, there is not always a happy ending to every race track horse. Yet again, there is some who do.    So, look carefully of what you are getting into and investigate further. Just going by "he said" or so doesn't give the full picture. You have to witness abuse and witness horses being abused in any sort of way.|`|434f308c3063deeecbf8c9fd06930e2eaa	Thoroughbred racing is a sport as nearly as cruel as greyhound racing. Horses aren't put down - many end up getting sold for pet food, getting abused, and ending up with injuries that require euthanasia (if Barbaro wasn't on national TV, they've have shot him on the spot).   Since people have brought it up: if you can't afford to adopt an ex-racing thoroughbred, please consider bringing an ex-racing greyhound into your home. They're sweet, housebroken, and some of the most low-key dogs I have ever known.

They've all been super friendly.    My opinion is that, in general, boxers have it in them to be wonderful, easy going family dogs, but, without strong leadership, lots of training and a TON of exercise, also have the potential to run your life.  Come to think of it, you could probably say the same thing of many many breeds.    So, bottom line, you will get out of your dog what you put into him/her.|`|ec34db7661779c6275eb85cdc10ef4cdaa	their okay but fiesty|`|5aba238df18dc4015a7ce3e3a10dd5a1aa	I think boxers are great dogs.

M9KUiTOAaa	Canaries make wonderful pets, they come in a wide range of colors, like yellow, red, orange, veriegated, some have funny hairdo's all are beautiful to look at. There are different kinds of singers, the most common and I think the most beautiful singer of all is the american singer. Make sure you get a male..because it is rare that you find a female that can sing. They eat canary seed mixes with plenty of niger and rape seed in it, they also need all sorts of fruit and vegetables and hard boiled eggs or some sort of eggs food mix or supplement is good for them.  They need a cuttle bone, although mine won't touch theirs, so I scrape it off and mix it in with their egg food.   They love a good bath about twice a week and are funny to watch.   They do like to scatter their seeds, so buy deep seed cups.  I do this thing with mine...that when he chirps I try to chirp right back to him the same way...he does it again and I try to repeat it back again...this goes on for a while until he breaks out into song and I cannot keep up with him anymore. It makes me smile and I feel like we have had some kind of communication.  I give mine some open flight time, where I turn off all ceiling fans and cover all the mirrors and windows and put away all the pets and just let them have free range of my room, they really enjoy that.  I don't think that I mentioned their singing yet... That's the best part....There is nothing like it in the whole wide world! No other bird, tame or in the wild sounds like this....It is absolutely amazing...They don't screech or get loud like other birds do, They just sing...they sing their little hearts out...It is a awesome sound...  I really hope that you do get a canary, they are a great choice and one that I think you will not regret.  By the way....did I mention their singing? lol...worth mentioning again..  They also like to hear your voice and are very curious when you are close to their cage. They are always busy doing something, so there is always something to watch...  Good luck, and I hope you find your little treasure!|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Male canaries are excellent singers and pleasant to watch flying in their cages.  Female canaries don't sing.  Canaries can live up to 20 years if well-cared for.  You can easily keep a single canary.  Canaries don't ususally like to be handled.  They are usually shy, timid birds.  The yellow canary is the most common, but red factors are next in popularity.  Canaries need the largest cage possible (minimum size is 12" x 12" x 15"), spacing between bars shouldn't be more than 1/2 inch.  Canaries are hardy and are best kept at room temperature.  Canaries need at least 12 hours of sleep, so keep the cage covered at night.  Canaries like a variety of foods, including canary seed, fruits and vegetables (apples, bananas, pears, corn, squash, cucumber, broccoli.)  They also like hard-boiled eggs.  They need a cuttlebone or mineral block for calcium.  They also need clean, fresh water every day.  Some signs of a healthy canary are clear, bright eyes, active and flying around, eats throughout the day, clean, smooth feathers, normal droppings.  Signs of illness include sleeping alot, not eating, not singing, sitting at the bottom of the cage, sneezing, fluffed up appearance (they do this to conserve body heat).  If your canary is ill, you need to take it to the vet.      Here is a website that further explains the different species of canaries:  http://www.avianweb.com/canariesspecies....|`|WebaFPgsaa	I breed canaries and they are really good pets.   If you want stories or facts, then I could tell you some:)   -You can train your canary to stand on your finger. I am training my canary so I can hold it when it is out of the cage. Whenever I put my finger to its chest, it will hop on my finger. It will stay there for about 2-20 minuts (depending on its mood) and then it will fly back towards it's cage. although it is difficult to do and takes a lot of time, It is worth it in the end  -they love eggs, lettuce, fruit, broccoli  -They sing A lot whenever the sun is out but they still sing a bit without it.  -They go to sleep when it's dark  -They come in different colours but the Original colour is yellow  -You need to clip their nails if they get too long you can get them clipped at the vet or do it yourself.  -Their singing is Absolutely beautiful  There is many facts about them and that is just a few  Hope you enjoy your canary!|`|614tYbzxaa	I have 2 canaries sylvester and tweet they are very EASY to look after.

y7igESfUaa	She might have a bladder infection or UTI (urinary tract infection). It is one of the most common ailments that effect cats (especially if they don't get enough water in their diet). Two of the symptoms include trying to pee but not a lot coming out and peeing in new and unusual spots, both that you mentioned. I would definitely bring her to the vet. A UTI often gets painful due to the formulation of crystals. Good luck to you.|`|CPxmHjx4aa	take her to the vet..she could have crystalization blocking it so she cant urinate properly or she could have an infection..  either way she needs to see a vet as both of these could cause alot of pain, other problems and could even result in death..|`|WqGxGJkbaa	VET NOW - your cat has cystitis and this can be life threatening if left too long.  Try to get her to drink as much as possible whilst you are waiting to get her to the vet.|`|V7pXzNKNaa	My cat does that sometimes, but unfortunately, it's not just a few drops, ha.  It could be an infection, or it could just be that she's claiming territory. Is her litter box clean? If not, clean it! I wouldn't want to use the toilet if there were remaining "substances" in there.  If you're really concerned, take her to the vet.
x7tsarblaa	There are about three possible reasons:    1. She may have a urinary tract infection   2. She may be marking her territory in order to entice a male cat  3. She may be throwing a tantrum    The first is a medical issue. In order to cross out this condition, please take your cat to the vet and inform them that she has never had this problem before and its a new issue. The fact that she is not fixed could also contribute to a urinary tract infection (bacteria that is being built up in the vuvla), she is frequently going into heat.    The other two are behavioral problems. The fact that she has not mated is making her frustrated, thus causing her to urinate in order to entice a male suitor. If she is not fixed or mated, she will continue this behavior. Also, if she is not meeting the appropriate attention or is stressed out, she may throw a tantrum by urinating on the floor. To ease the stress, I recommend acquiring FELIWAY. It is a pheromone diffuser that eases a cat's nerves, thus resulting in a calmer, stress free cat. Do keep in mind that a heat cycle can be quite stressful. My male cat used to be stressed and frustrated out of his mind since he was season and was not being mated, he even began spraying on everything. I eventually fixed him and all of these behaviors stopped at once. The Feliway reduced the behavior to a certain extent, but fixing it stopped it completely. I do not want to tell you to fix her, but I do advice it. Good luck with everything.     p.s. Make sure to buy a urine enzyme remover in order to remove the smell of the urine that may entice her to urinate in the same area again.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	Peeing outside the litter box is often a sign of a physical problem like a Urinary tract infection.  You  should have your cat checked by a vet to rule out any medical problems before you try anything else.|`|zeTGmB3faa	You need to do two things immediately.

It could be a UTI...take her to the vet and see.  If the cat can still smell it, she will continue to go potty there.|`|9NDL5YQJaa	Either she has a urinary tract infection or it is because she is in heat.  She is probably frustrated from not getting any cat love and taking out her frustration on your floor.  I would get her fixed if you want to avoid the problem.  Also get her checked for the possible UTI.|`|DXzI2jrEaa	The first thing to do is get her to a vet. There's a very good chance that she has a urinary tract infection. If so, your vet will give you an antibiotic for her that will take care of the problem quickly. Ask for a liquid because it's easy to to give to the cat.    If she gets a clean bill of health, the next thing to do is to determine what is upsetting her. Did you buy a new litter box? Did you change your brand of litter? Is there a new pet in the house? Lots of things can cause a cat to stress.    The next step is to treat and clean any thing she has peed on. Go to a pet supply store and buy a product like Nature's Miracle which breaks down the enzymes and odor caused by the urine. This will prevent her from being attracted back to the same spots.    Finally, to get her back in the litter box, buy a bottle of  Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat Ultra Litter Attractant. This is a finely ground herb mix that is sprinkled over clean cat litter. One container treats 100 lbs. of litter, it works like magic, and it only costs about $13.99 for a 20 oz. bottle. It also comes with a great brochure with all kinds of information about cats and litter box problems.     I hope you will consider having her spayed as soon as possible.  Besides the distress she (and you) may feel when she is in heat, spaying helps lower the risk of mammarian cancer and uterine disease in cats.    Good luck to you!|`|ktdpOM8Maa	Yes, it could be a urinary tract infection...    However, animals are attracted to places they've gone before, so (and I mean no offense here) if you haven't thoroughly cleaned with bleach or an alternative, she may be smelling herself and feeling like it's ok to go there over and over again.     Just a thought.|`|NUzxjOLLaa	CUZZ IT FEELZ LIKE IT GOSH IM GONNA GET THE BEST ANSWER VOTE FO' ME!!!|`|sBdcBpsZaa	well how old is the cat? if its not a year old yet then u better train it 2 us the litter box, First get a cat box and put litter in it then pick up the cat and put him/her in the cat box and make sure the cat stays in there 4 a few minutes.and i know this b/c i am a EXPERT when it comes 2 animals just about...

4XUC1iKMaa	hi,   if you are a first time bird owner i would start of small with something like a budgie or a cocktiel. i will explain a bit about both.      budgies: budgies make wonderful companions once tame. they come in every colour that you can possibly think of except for orange, red, or completely black.  they should be hand fed because they are not naturally tame. they don't need a lot of room or attention. though you should spend at least 1 hour with them a day. and that is just the bare minimum. they also become very attached to their human owners and once attached they will stay boned for life. there life span is from 10 - 13 years. but in some rare cases some have been known to live up to 15 years. a budgie who spends a life time in the cage will only live about half of their potential life span. so be sure to take the bird out at least once a day.       also budgies are prone to obesity so try to give them foods with little or no food coloring and just a little fat. give them lots of fruits and veggies such as frozen peas or corn, strawberries, cucumber, blueberries, mango, pasta with no sauce of any type or salt on it, and cooked rice with nothing on it.      cockatiels: they are larger than a budgie but are not to big. they are very dependent on their owners and make excellent companions. there life span is from 10 - 20 years. but in captivity they will probably only live the most of 15 years. they need lots of attention and become very tempermental if not given a lot of attenion. they should be give a medium sized cage. they do not need to much room but they still need room. some people fnd their chirp to be annoying because of how loud it can be. but then there are those cockateils that don't have a loud chirp at all. they also need a balanced diet of seeds, pellets, fruits and veggies. they can have all of the same things a budgie can have. i find that big hits with cockatiels are grapes, apples and rice.       some things that you will need to do for your bird is give him a bath once a week and twice during molting season. you will need to change their water at leat 2 times a day and their food as needed. you will need to change the bottum of the cage once a day. and you cn line the bottum of the cage with paper towels or news paper. any way i hope that this has helped but if you have any further questions or concerns please feel free to email me at lizzie10157@yahoo.com|`|JMZkaf1jaa	Male cockatiels are great talkers and very social with us humans.  You teach him all kinds of things.  I would start with a small bird like a cockatiel first.  Birds can be very expensive, especially the larger birds.  Hope this helps.|`|yHVwgkMNaa	A quaker is not always a good first bird. They are very intelligent and can be manipulative.    A cockatiel is a good choice, and is very common.    However I'd like to recommend a great parrot that is not anywhere near as popular as other parrots: the lineolated parakeet. For some odd reason, it is considered a parakeet, but like budgies/parakeets, it is actually a parrot.    They are small, very playful, and one of the (if not THE) most docile and sweet species of pet birds there is.    I highly recommend checking out this website/forum which has a ton of info and many great people willing to offer advice:  http://www.lineolatedparakeet.net/forums|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Parakeets or cockatiels make great first birds.

hKVOw1Sjaa	Cats must have a very high protein diet and l  can assure you bread is a filler only and of no value at all.Eggs are fine but not every day and only the yolk.Yes they are cow milk intolerant although look for non-lactose milk it is avail at most supermarkeets or health shops.A kitten loves this and must be fed this as it needs to grow.They are carnivores as you know very well not vegetarians and will perish if you continue the way you are going and l do not mean to be nasty saying this but have seen a few cases where peope have put cats on a veg diet and they die,we could not save them.OKDepending how strict a vegetarian you are do yu object to fish?Cats will kill for this so either fresh and steam or do in microwave briefly not raw and no bones.Sardines are fine but not in tomato juice Cat dry food does come in ttuna or fish variety so that will ease your conscience  as they  need this a good brand of dry food as well and also they need water avail all the time.One of my friend is a vegetarian and  she has no issue feeding her cats canned food of whatever as she is not eating it the animal is.You have to weigh up what is best for your kittens and although you do not want to lower your ethics and animal is not you  so you do not have to handle meat there are loads of canned food of fish platter,sardines,tuna etc.A kittnen will even have a little porridge with non-lactose milk and if you cannot find it and are wiling to pay for kitten milk this is identical to non-lactose but in my Country the non lactose is much cheaperl am not going to go into vet terms as what a cat needs as you neeed a straight to the point answer and l an a vet nurse plus l occasionaly breed siamese and when have time show 2.My main hobby is as a registered dog breeder so although l love cats of all varieties and we have all sorts of issues at my work one of the worsti the people who fail to understand that unlike dogs a kiten/cat MUST have a really high proteein diet.Good luck and hope l have helpeed in a small way.Any questions e-mail me l will always answer..By the way what a super person you are adopting 2 stray kittens not many people would but dump them at a shelter so full marks to you for kindness and asking what to do.You get star for the day for this.|`|R5LuKSUXaa	cats need meat!

Nature made them to be obligate carnivores - they have no choice in the matter.  The best bet is to either take them to a shelter, or get them real cat food.  The diet you are feeding them now isn't what they need to survive.  Milk especially may give them the runs, which will kill a kitten.|`|MqYfsYd0aa	um, cat food?  if you're very against even getting them cat food with meat, check with the local pet speciality stores, or even the organic markets to see if they have any meat-less cat food...|`|spbqfjvbaa	Kitten food, please!  They usually have kiten food at most major supermarkets, organic shops, feed & supply stores, etc.      Cats are lactose intolerate to cow's milk.  Bread is of no nutritional value, just a filler.  Eggs, although a protein source, doesn't have a protien that cats need in their diet called taurine.  Cats need taurine (an essential amino acid found in animla protein) in their diet to live.  Seriously.  And the only way they get taurine is through meat.  Cats are true carnivores & need meat (animal protien) to live.    So, please find these cute little carnivores some kitten food!  Don''t give them cow's (or any other type) of milk.
RloOJ43haa	If the pony otherwise fits your needs and is a good mount for you, I'd try no to worry about it too hard. I'm 5'8" and I used to ride a 15.2hh Arab (not quite as big a size difference as you have). I think a lot of people worry about 'fit' too much. A good rider on a good horse can almost always find a way to work together. After all Teddy O'Connor was 14.1. Karen O'Connor is not a tall person like you are, but she's not short either. Try considering it a riding challenge. It's harder to stay in the middle of a small horse than a big horse.|`|8cikAYp3aa	15H is fine for your size.   I'm 6'2 and rode a 14.2 mare for years.  Bigger is not always better but in todays world people especially young people are pushed to think they need 16 or even 17 hands to "fit".   If your instructor often asks you to lengthen your leathers odds are your riding short, have been growing and not re adjusting.  For people with long legs, put the first knuckle or even finger tips on the buckle and measure the stirups to your armpit.  riding longer is going to feel odd at first but you will get used to it and you will learn to soften your leg so it lays against this side of your horse.  Depending on how long your leg is cues may come from your calf or lower leg rather then your heel.  This is fine and acceptable.    try riding longer, and see,  the horse might still suit you without you really knowing it.  Unless all you really are after is a new mount and then nothing will ever make him feel right again to you.|`|eXDDODfHaa	a 15hh horse is a good size for people that are like 5"5 and around that age.    so ur height realy doesnt matter.|`|I55JNnvpaa	only 14.2 hands and lower is a pony, so technally its a horse. and by your weight, I say your fine. your tall, but I think if you showed us a picture, we would tell you better|`|3YHZUuhyaa	15hh is not a pony, it's a horse. We can't really tell if you're too tall for the horse without seeing a picture. could you post one?     I have a 15hh horse and I'm about 5'6". If the horse can carry your weight, there's nothing to worry about. You're definitely not too heavy for it. I wouldn't worry about it. Be happy you have that one =D I sure would LOVE to have a 16hh-16.2hh horse but right now we just can't afford it. Even if I do outgrow my 15hh horse, i could NEVER imaging selling him. He's my baby.     Here's some pics of me and my horse so you can have a comparison    http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm40/...  http://i292.photobucket.com/albums/mm40/...    good luck! =D|`|2tnXJmfkaa	I have kind of the same problem. Im 14 also and im 5"5, i have a arab cross pony that is 12.3! so when you say your horse is 15 hh i dont think you should worry. If you love this pony and you think she is the right one for you then keep her nothing is stopping you the height really isnt that big an issue. However it is VERY hard to get the right pony for you. before i got my pony i took out 3 horses on loan and however hard it was to give them back i knew they wernt the right ones for me. If the height thing is such a big deal for you then i think your pony might not be the right one for you. But then again i dont have a clue how you are with your horse x) Connemara is quite a strong breed anyway so i wouldnt worry. But if this is an issue for you just say to your parents i dont think my horse is working out as i think i have grown out of him/her. Im sure they will understand and be glad you told them so they wont have to spend money on something your not enjoying =]    hope this helps (:  sorry if i rambled on a bit x)|`|pS8A05NTaa	try to end the lease and look for a larger pony. talk to your parents, they might agree with you!|`|NApGmuHdaa	Ask your instructor if you are truly to big for the pony or if you are just not used to the position of the stirrups your instructor wants you in. You are not to heavy for the pony so don't in the slightest worry about that. The economy is going down at the moment so you do not want to give your parents something to worry about, or you for that matter.     You could stop the lease and find a friend who would share a horse. You each pay for half the horse you own half the horse she pays half the expenses and so do you. This may work and you will get the benefit of riding cheaply!! You could also try working at a place for horses as a groom or stable hand and the owner then usually lets you ride and sometimes even show horses until you or your parents can afford a different one.    Good luck|`|bqbrKFeUaa	I would just ask your trainer in private if she thinks your to big, ponies can carry a lot of weight and i think if you were to big the trainer would tell you or your parents right away.|`|sbB0TpGXaa	Whoa! 5' 9" and 110 lbs?  If that wasn't a type-o then you need to remeasure.    Not happening.  The weight is fine for the horse.  So is the height.  But the two don't go together.|`|it3Bh2wEaa	It's not a matter if the horse is actually to small. It's more of, are you comfortable and balanced? If you feel yourself becoming off balanced easier and are no longer comfortable, sit on a taller horse, and see if their is a difference. As far as you're legs feeling in the wrong position, ask your tainer. If she has yet to say anything about it, they're probably just fine. It's very hard to advance your skills in riding if you're constantly feeling too big on the horse and offbalanced. It's all about how you feel when siting on the horse. Does it feel right to YOU?|`|6DCQsdyuaa	You are a little big for this horse. 110lbs is ok, but you are a little too tall for him. You should be able to find a bigger horse (around 16.2hh-17+hh) that will be in your price range. Bigger is not always more expensive in the horse world. I know how you feel. Even though I am your age and 4'11'' I have ridden 11.2hh ponies and felt ridicilous. You won't be a burden to your parents if you just tell them how you feel, but first you should probably reaserch to find a horse that's a good height, and within you price range and ability.     ask your instructor to let you know if there are any horses up for lease, or sale that she thinks would be good for you. She or he should be able to help you find the perfect match!  Good luck!! =)

The leg won't heal on its own, and will only get worse if it goes untreated.  Eventually, she will die.  She may be pregnant.  Egg carrying birds do tend to eat more.  She will have a bulge down by her tummy if she is carrying eggs.  Your parakeet needs to be kept warm and well-nourished.|`|614tYbzxaa	of course if she has broken her foot take her to a vet its an obvious thing to do|`|TSQxwlbraa	take her to the vet
Yr4eBnXlaa	Since he's so young, I would advise getting him checked by an good avian vet (certified, if available).  You want to rule out medically trigger plucking first.  Come plucking can be triggered by itchiness, which can be caused by various ailments such as:  liver disease/dysfunction, kidney dysfunction, allergic reactions to peanuts or sunflower seeds, etc.    Only after making absolutely certain that he's perfectly health and get all the nutrition he requires (quality pellets, seeds, fresh produce, grains), can you assume that this is a behavioural issue.     Plucking due to boredom is common among parrots that spend a lot of time alone while their human companion is away at work, etc.  They need lots of stimulating sights, sounds, textures, puzzles, and foraging experiences to fill their day.  Wild parrots spend 50% of their waking lives just finding food.  Without that to fill their time, "house parrots" have way too much time to fill with other activities.      Foraging toys provide necessary, and useful "work" for captive parrots.  There are many good foraging toys and devices on the market.  Google search:  "foraging toys, parrot"  to find an online store near you that has a good selection of interesting and challenging foraging toys for your bird.      You can implement foraging now, while you are exploring medical causes for your bird's plucking.  Making the transition to only using foraging toys to feed your bird should be done carefully.  Load the toys, and install them gradually while continuing to provide food in bowls.  Many parrots will ignore their bowls entirely once they understand how to use the foraging devices.  At that point you can remove the bowls.  However, you will still need bowls for offering the fresh foods he needs.    There is a DVD on the market called "Captive Foraging" and it's well worth it, giving the viewer examples of introducing foraging to birds that have never had the experience before.  It's available at many online retailers including:      http://www.birdsupplies.com/Captive-Fora...  http://www.birdbrains.ca/en/products/for...  http://www.amazon.com/CAPTIVE-FORAGING-D...    Chewing and preening toys can also keep your bird's beak busy.  Small chunks of soft woods, like pine, birch, or alder will keep your bird's ever-growing beak in trim condition.  Vegetable-dyed leather and cotton rope will provide other chewing challenges that are safe for him.  Sterile feathers (like peacock tail feathers) and butcher's cord make excellent preening toys (when using string or cotton cord, make sure the pieces are very short, like pom-pom toys.)  Simple toys are always preferred to anything that's too big or complex, and can be made at home, so a lot of money is not necessary to keep your bird entertained.    Here a DIY site:  http://www.cheepparrottoysntips.com/toyi...    For general "company" and to provide your Grey with the sounds of other parrots, you can play the "Bird Sitter DVD" available from the same retailers as the "Captive Foraging" DVD.  It's a looping video of captive parrots in an aviary setting, eating, preening, allopreening, displaying, calling, etc.  My Grey seems to enjoy this every day.  The "other birds" have become part of the flock, and it relaxes him.      http://www.birdieboutique.com/birdsitter...    When you are at your vet's office, ask about the feather regrowth.  Normally, feathers will come back unless the follicle is severely damaged, but even then they will sometimes come back but will be a weaker feather.  Since your bird is still so young, I doubt that he has damaged the follicles badly.    Feathers will regrow quite quickly if the feather has actually been pulled, but most birds chew the shaft until the feather drops off, leaving a small piece of quill in the follicle.  New feathers won't grow until the quill is "moulted" during the normal moult cycle.  Greys generally start their first moult close to their first birthday (hatch date), so he may not have new feathers for quite a while.  Your vet can advise you on this after a close examination of your bird's plucked areas.    I hope things work out for you two.  Best wishes.|`|LkdZPgvjaa	If the bird keeps plucking over a long period of time, no, the damaged feathers will not grow back.  He is plucking his feathers out for some reason but it could be the reason is gone but plucking now it's a habit.  Does he get a bath at least 2x/week?  What about the air quality he lives in... is there smoke, cooking fumes or grease that might have gotten on him?  Is there enough moisture in the air as sometimes a humidifier will  help. A bird's skin can get dry and itchy just like ours does in the sun.  Speaking of which, is he getting any sun?  UVB and full spectrum lights are crutial to a bird's health  It might be that he's bored - does he sit in a cage all day by himself? Does he have toys to play with?  Does he have "family" and feel as if he's a part of yours -   that he's loved?  Many times it's been found many birds pluck their own feathers out because their diet is not good enough. Does he get a variety of fresh foods every day or just a little piece of something thrown in with seeds, nuts and grains the main part of his diet?  If you want his feathers to improve, you have to give him an environment that facilitates this.  You have to find out why he started plucking in the first place.  Make changes one by one and see if there is some improvement.  Hopefully he's young enough where you can help him to grow his feathers, not just sit around and wish for it. Each year, all of the feathers will 'molt' out and be replaced with new ones.  This can take from 4 or 5 mos. to a full year and is different for every species of bird (a baby cockatiel can lose his entire tail but it will be replaced in maybe 2 or 3 wks.) and I think plumage regrowth for Af. Grey's is a lot slower = like I already said - anywhere from 4 or so months to a full year, depending on how badly damaged the quills or skin has become.  This is a very complex problem, different reason for different birds, and has no easy, textbook answer.  Try the diet 1st off though.  Give him more variety and lots of fresh fruits/veggies every day as well as mineral blocks &/or cuttlebone for calcium.|`|JMZkaf1jaa	It is called molting and he will go through molts a couple of times a year.  Yes, they will grow new ones.  As the new ones are ready to come in, he will pluck at the old one to get it out.  Do not help him, he knows what he is doing.  What you can do for him, is make sure he gets more protein during this time cause his feathers are pure protein and he will need more protein during this time.  Boiled chicken is good.  Also, millet is a good source of protein.  He will be cranky at times while he goes through this process and he needs more rest from working so hard at removing his feathers.  There is no time limit as to when they will grow in, but feeding him more protein may help the process go faster. Also, make sure you are misting him as that also helps with this process.  Misting should only be 2-3 times a week. Hope this helps.

Salt is bad for them; her feet should be rinsed off in clear water every time she comes in from outside and has been exposed to salt.  If she won't wear booties, I don't have any other ideas - but I do think she needs to be seen by a vet because her rawness could be something besides ice and salt.  You must be very careful about putting creames of any kind on your dog because they will likely lick them off and could become sick.

dvxClOM9aa	In halter class the judge looks for balance in your horse and the build. If your horse is overweight, showing fat where muscle should be, yes you'll be docked for it.  When you first enter the ring you need to line up with the judge. You horse should be straight from the judge. Set your horse up and have your toes pointed at a 45 degree angle towards the left front hoof. Look at the judge and he/she should nod their head when they are ready for you to come forward. Once they do, walk towards the judge make sure you're standing up straight as you're walking, smiling, and look at the judge. && while walking your horse should STILL be lined up with the judge. Once you get to the judge, square your horse up. Don't take too long doing that. The judge will then move around your horse, which this part gets tricky for some people.  When you have your horse squared up pretend there is a line going down the back of the horse and one about where the withers go so you have 4 squares.  When the judge is on the right side of the horse, by the head. you need to be on the left side of the horse, when the judge passes that line by the withers you need to step across in be on the left side of the horse ((you should always be presenting your horse, so have the 45 degree angle and when you step across there should be a 3 step process doing it.)) when the judge crosses the line going down it's back ((which will be the center of the butt)) you then cross back to the left side of the horse, and when the judge crosses the next line by the withers on the left side move back to the right side.. then when the judge gets back to the front center of the horse go back to where you started.. which should be the left side.. NEVER be in the same square as the judge.. the judge will then ask you to trot away to the line.. When trotting away make sure you look back at the judge and trot all the way to the line.  and when you're lined up make sure you're always showing your horse, the judge is always watching you.     I know this is long and it was kind of hard to explain, but I've been in 4-H for 10 years and I am now a 4-H leader, so I hope this helps. Any other ?'s just ask!   - - oh && it depends on the breed of the horse too.. I always showed quarter horses and paints..|`|RZPLec5Eaa	Halter. Is simple. Square up (that's what QH's do...what breed are you doing?) at the 1st cone. The judge will nod when she/he's ready for you. You nod back. Walk straight to the judge. She will move and you trot past her. Then you go to line up and do the quadrents. If she's on the one side you be on the other, that kid of deal.|`|suTye2m2aa	Please let us know what kind of showing you are doing?

GhsdPFdaaa	First off, congrats. =] It's a great sport to get in to.     Now, as far as what you'll need: If you are going to a riding stable you should only need to bring boots, a helmet, and a treat for the horse you are going to be riding. Now the last thing isn't necessary, I just like to. As far as your boots, most people recommend that you have a show with a heel that is at least 1/2". I wouldn't really recommend one much bigger then that because in a worst case scenario it could be dangerous. As for your helmet, make sure you have it adjusted for you before your lesson. I'm not sure if you are going to be taking riding lessons at a barn or just learning at a friends house but you will need to ride jeans and a long sleeved shirt. Depending on what discipline you will be riding you can also wear those stretchy pants.     I wouldn't recommend buying a horse until you know that  you are seriously interested. First off it is a big commitment. You have to have somewhere to house the horse, somewhere to purchase and store hay and feed, and your horse will also need vet and farrier visits. Do you have a way for paying of all of this? It is a big expense for your parents if you aren't serious about riding. So for your first year or so I would recommend just riding a lesson horse or a friends horse.|`|iRVqqHcQaa	well it all really depends on the style of riding you prefer, western or english? since this is your first time i highly suggest western riding to aquire your "sea legs" as my boss lady refers to it :-) i dont really see were you would exactly need gloves...... breeches if u choose english  is the style. as to getting a horse of your own i tell you DO NOT GET ONE. sorry if i sound rude at all but you are a beggining rider and i have been in your shoes. you need to learn things like the proper feeding, shoeing, blaketing and what to do incase of collick ( a digestive problem that occurs in crazy weather or if the horse doesnt get enough water) that and in the case of the crappy economy horses are very expensive......Xp so congrats on the lessons and good luck i hope the best for you!!!|`|7IAcCmLwaa	well you have to wear long pants preferably jeans (so ur leg doesnt slide all around with sweat pants on). the boots should have a heel, but not a very big heel at all. you should get chaps if u are goin to b riding alot because they prevent ur legs from getting rubbed on the saddle.     So u know somewhat of wat ur doin:    TACKING UP:    grooming:    -u first start with a circular brush with big "teeth" called a curry comb ( http://www.morrisequitation.co.uk/images... )          -with this brush u brush it in a circular motion.  -then u use a soft bristled brush, this brush has a softer feel to it than the hard brush. ( http://www.frogpool.com/prod-2871.jpg )          -with this brush u brush them in the direction of their fur.  -then u use a hard/stiff bristled brush                                          http://www.justforponies.com/tailtamerwh... )         -again with this brush u groom them in the direction of their fur  -the last thing u groom with is a hoof pick(have someone help you with this)   ( http://www.uksaddlery.com/usrimage/hoof%... )           -with this u have to first face their butt                 -then u run ur had down their leg                -they should then pick up their foot                 - then u hold their hoof and pick the dirt out AROUND there frog (the triangluar part under there hoof: http://www.flickr.com/photos/chris-favor...   -becus their frog is very sensitive    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6cSRE_tD...    then u put the tack on...(have ur instructor explain that)    there are 3 most important things u need to know:  -to keep the stirrup on the ball of ur foot and to keep ur heels down.  -to sit up straight   -and to look where U want to go.    to walk on: lighten ur seat and sqeeze ur legs    to trot(like a jog): squeeze ur legs at the walk         -when u first start out trotting just sit it. then after u get use to it try posting. Posting is when you rise and sit with ur ponys outside leg (leg closest to the wall/fence)     to hold the reins:   -first put ur pinky on the bottom of the reins  -then put ur other fingers on top except for ur thumb  -last u wrap ur thumb around the reins   kind of like this:  http://www.bloog.ca/bloog-images/uploads...    to turn:  -pull the rein in the direction u want to go (pull right rein, go right) (pull left rein, go left)  -pull the rein to ur hip  -Remember to look where u want to go    to stop from a walk:  -sit deeply  -stop ur legs from moving  -pull back on ur reins    to stop from a trot:  -depending on the instructor u can either:          -sit ur trot and then tug on ur reins          -or slow ur posting and then tug on ur reins.    ***I hope you enjoy urself***      here are some horse videos:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2zh7BesS...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_ib5t27T...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3STHNZFJr...|`|O49CiL1waa	if i were you i would rent a horse, for now.some riding equiment you will need is a helment,a saddle,saddle pads,horse boots and boots for you and you might need a riding coach they will help you alot|`|0v1ecp2Jaa	Do not buy a horse if you've never ridden before. Especially if no one in your family has had experience with a horses before. A horse is not like a dog, there is so much that goes into taking care of a horse. I just got my horse two years ago and I have been ridding for 14 years. I still think that its so much to handle and I'm so glad my mom used to have horses cause she helps me out so much. My horses board is really expensive. I pay $450 a month for that alone. All the money I make I end up using on her vet costs (which can be SO expensive sometimes) or board. Having a horse takes up a lot of time too, she needs to be exercised everyday. Its hard to leave for vacations because you always need to make sure someone will ride her and take care of her.  I would recommend just ridding for maybe a year to see how you like it and to understand horses more. You can also lease a horse at the barn that you're at.    As far as ridding equipment goes, you really do not need all the fancy gizmo's and gadgets. I always ride in under armour leggings, with short chaps. gloves are not necessary. I wouldn't go and spend all the money on ridding attire, what if you don't like it? Never ride without your helmet. I guarantee that at some point you will fall off. It has happened to us all, and you will be so grateful for that helmet. The barn will have everything the horse will need. (saddle, saddle pad, girth, bridal, ect.) I wouldn't buy that stuff untill you're actually serious about ridding or you have your own horse cause you need the right saddle size to fit the type of horse. If you don't own your own horse or if you don't ride the same size horse everytime the saddle wouldn't fit right and hurt the horse and then you wouldn't be able to use it. Right now, a saddle would be a total waste of money.|`|wYBU1B1qaa	Sounds like everyone has covered what to wear...just listen to them about jeans or long pants, boots with a heal--this is to prevent your foot from going through the stirrup which if you fell off, could be a disaster, and a HELMET!!  When you get into the saddle for the first time, remember to relax!  Relax everything...your legs hips and your shoulders.  Sometimes falls happen because the rider is too tense.  Also, the horse can sense that too and horses are prey animals.  He will wonder why you're tense which will make him tense up--can be trouble.  Don't yank on the reins...assuming you're on a propery trained horse, think soft hands.  He should stop and turn with little pressure.  Remember too, this is a horse.  Rub his neck when he does well and tell him he's a good boy (or girl if it's a mare).  Please make sure the person who owns the horses know you are a brand new rider and an older, schooling horse is what you need to ride.  This info is just a tiny little tip of the iceberg when it comes to horseback riding.  Take lessons with someone who will teach you not only how to ride, but also how to act around horses, take care of horses such as grooming, groundwork.  Just leading a horse around on a leadrope properly is something you need to learn.  I hope you enjoy it....it's something that you can have fun with for many, many years to come!  Good luck!|`|uKDGtBHgaa	don't listen to them about the jeans. every trainer i have benn with has said that jeans look more professional, this may sound weird but its true. ive benn ridine for 10 years, scince i was 2! and i am very sucessful. those facts about jeans are not true.|`|0RLrs7Ajaa	You are buying proper boots aren't you, or boots with a heel... or anything apart from wellington boots. just you're not ment to wear them now when riding. lol, just thought I'd let you know incase you were buying them :). Have a good time!!!|`|rTSwouqXaa	The best advice I ever got about riding in general was from one of the worlds best rough stock riding coaches.    Keep a leg on each side and your mind in the middle.    You do that and everything will be fine.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	Riding shirt, pants, boots, helmet, gloves. I would definitely rent a horse and don't buy one until a lot lot lot of experience. Make sure where you rent from can supply you with reins, saddle, pad, and if they don't you will also have to purchase that. Good luck you'll love it.|`|QdQcAHqaaa	You will need either riding jodhpurs, chaps to go over jeans, or half chaps, which slide over the boot and come up to the knee. Obviously chaps only work with short boots.    As far as buying a horse...give it a year and then talk about buying. Jumping into something as huge as owning a horse when you haven't even started yet is not wise.  A good stable will have many types of horses to suit your needs as your skills evolve.  If you do decide to buy, don't forget that horses also get put up for adoption and are in ride-able condition.     Best luck to you! I've ridden for ten years and am still in love!|`|RPTwjyjIaa	You should try riding for a while before you start to buy a lot of stuff. When I did lessons my trainer had helmets that people could use and you do not necessarily need gloves. She also had boots but they were donated and used so much by different people they were uncomfortable. Try finding someone who is selling an old pair of theirs that is still in good condition (and they will already be broken in). Try doing ridding lessons for a while (like at least a year) and then if you still like it you can look into leasing a horse or keep doing lessons with your trainers horse. That is fine to. I have seen a lot of people put a lot of money (boots, saddle, helmet, gloves, clothes, etc) into horses and then decided that horses are not for them, or it is not the right time, or something came up, and they sold all their stuff for only half what they paid. Just have fun and enjoy horse back lessons for now. If you do decide to get into horses more there will always be time latter to buy stuff.|`|Pn9tPYKbaa	dont beat ur horse lol. just thought that might be the first thing i said:) when you have ur horse, remeber, they respond to everything you do, everything!!:) it was very easy for me to learn how to ride a horse. when i got my first horse, i was so happy. i learned to gallope the next day:) and then within a week i got the courage to jump over logs on are trials:)  when you ride bareback, make sure yout heels are down, and dont sqeeze with ur thighs, its easyer to just sit there limp, move with the horse, when she horse trots, bounce up and down with it, with you gallope, sway back and forth with ur horse. never pull back to hard on the riegns, or else it will cause the horse to act up, and that is no fun:) and if ur horse does something wrong, dont get off. then she will think if she does that, you will get off, stay on and slap her[not to hard] when you get bucked off, dont cry about it and refuse to get back on, cowgirl up and hop on that horse. show it who is boss, that you are the leader of the herd. make ur horse respect you, and trust you. any other questions, just email me:)|`|3rt8oKIzaa	I think that you have it all covered. When you are more into it, I would suggest riding clothes. I think that you picked a great hobby. :)|`|6DCQsdyuaa	ok first of all you clearly know nothing about horses! sorry to sound mean. I have been riding for 8 years and I am your age and still have not bought a horse yet. I have leased many but not untill I was able to walk, trot, and canter without stirrups, two point, and jump crossrails (which took 3 years to acheive this level of mastery in the sport.) Horseback riding is not like any other  sport, and you should not buy or lease untill you have been riding for 3+ years. If you jump into buying, then you will not be able to treat the horse appropriately. Buy a velvet helmet, paddock boots, half chaps, and jodpuhrs if you plan on continueing riding. Once you start showing (which won't be for a long time) you need to buy gloves to match your boots and saddle.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	Do NOT buy your own horse unless you know what you're doing. a lot of people think they're ready to buy a horse so they just find one that looks pretty, and buy it!   I recommend that you take lessons for at least a year (at LEAST) before you think about buying a horse.   An inexperienced horse person buying they're own horse is dangerous unless the horse is extremely bombproof.    If you do decide to buy your own horse, i would take lessons on it for quite awhile before you decide to ride on your own.   Horses are A LOT of work but they can be a fantastic experience for anybody if the people know what they're doing.    Just some suggestions. I hope you have fun horseback riding! It really is FUN!    I hope this helps! good luck! =D|`|VmZKZjP1aa	Take some lessons. I bet you can find some relatively cheap in your area. Maybe even work for them at the stable, mucking, feeding, etc. Which will help you to just be around horses.     Then if you've had lessons, you can know what kind of riding you are comfortable with (English, Western, etc). I think western is a little easier to start out in (but I'm biased :) )    Other than lessons, I would just spend as much time around horses as you can. Learn how they move, act, what they like, etc.     I wouldn't buy a horse anyway, until you are comfortable riding and know what kind you like and the tack you'll need, and (like you said) have the money for them.     Good luck. Horses are the best form of fun!|`|jpqt4KEhaa	When I was 11 I wanted a horse of my very own so bad but my parents weren't going to let me until I Knew how much responsibility it was. So when I was 13 I went to a local stable and offered them my my services for free. I talked to the manager and said that I really want a horse and I want to know how much work they are. Well the first stable turned me down flat, as did the second. But the third was a smaller one now quite as snooty and they said that would be great to basically I work as an understudy stable hand for a year. After the first month or two of working, cleaning and mucking and tending to the horses, my mom said she was would purchase me lessons 1 time per week as long as i kept my school and work up. So I learned to ride at the same stable. and I would have been purchasing one of the horse for sale in the stable but we moved.     I would suggest this for you find a place that where you can learn the responsibility and what you need and then get some lessons and if you don't like it in the end you are not committed to anything.     First horses are rough sometimes you don't know what you are getting in to My first horse was sold to me as a 15 year old and turned out to be 30 and have arthritis, and was on butte when I rode him so he wouldn't show any signs. I kept him for two years but his food has to be watered with hot boiling water so he could eat it, and he took about three hours to eat, before we could let him out the pasture, and then if I rode him I would have to put liniment on his legs for hours and i couldn't ride him agian for a few days. It taught me how not fun horses can be, they are alot of work.     So if you do decide that buying a horse is for you get a person from a local stable of someone with alot oof horse experiance to go with you to find the right one. Or you might end up with a 30 year old.|`|pS8A05NTaa	i would look around for a stables that offers lessons and take some  that might open doors for a lease or borrow a horse  that way you know what you're getting into|`|USt4MZSBaa	i am 14 too and horseback riding is such a great hobby i love it. will you ride english or western?? i ride english and its awesome. keep your heels down so you can balance properly. if you fall it's not a big deal, just get back on and keep riding. keep your hands steady, keep your back straight. :)|`|NwhrZt9Saa	I am new to horseback riding and starting in the spring also! You don't need anything other than that. In less you wanted to get riding pants(breeches). But it may be better to wait a while so you don't waste money if you don't like it. Good luck!|`|q9Dg8BdFaa	A nice helmet that fits properly. They have sizes small,medium,and large. I never rode with glooves. But it would be nice to get them if you start showing! Boots,yes with a heel. NO FLAT ONES!  You dont need to rent a horse until you can properly take care of one. I have a horse and have been riding for 5 years and I havent even had mine a year yet! Lots and lots of learning. And ready,and OBSERVING! Listen carefully to your instructor and always do what he/she says. However, if you feel uncomfortable on a horse or you feel as if something was wrong. TELL YOUR INSTRUCTOR!!! I was thrown off my first day of cantering because my instructor didnt listen to be. It wasnt me saddle I rode with insted it was way bigger than what i rode with and the stirrups were to long. But he didnt listen and because of that, i was slung into a gate! Horse rideing can be fun, be difficult at the same time. Practice defenatley makes perfect and you well NEVER get it perfect on the first try.  So dont get frustrated if you cant do something.|`|mW7mBOAcaa	You should make sure you like to ride before you buy your own horse.You can buy some boots and a helmet, but until you're showing it's OK to ride in jeans.You may need your own tack and grooming stuff, too.|`|EQ2eS4CBaa	Ok, advice, make sure you are comfortable with your horse. You will need a helmet for sure, don't worry about gloves and boots, you can ride in tennis shoes, and jeans, I don't have any riding apparel like you see in movies, and i get along GREAT. Read lots of books. Have a teacher go to www.iowaaeaonline.org an order you two books     1.) The Horse Encyclopedia    2.) The basic Guide to Equestrian      I am a very experienced horse person, but I am reading these too.
qw9ZjAlDaa	It depends on the saddle.  If it's a well made saddle, I like them.  I have a Stubben with them and really like them because they help keep my leg in the right place.  But I've also ridden in cheap saddles with them and they are annoying and in the say and push your leg out of place.    I know that's a wishy-washy answer but it's the truth!|`|RloOJ43haa	I really prefer having knee rolls. I find that they help you keep your lower leg much more secure. And when your base of support is secure, you are secure.|`|jhgKFJJzaa	in my opinion i think it helps cos in some way it helps get your legs in the right position!|`|z3Z7AQWPaa	I have ridden in saddles with and without them. And either way it doesn't really effect how I ride. When you have knee blocks it makes you feel a little more secure but that's about it. But your security should com from your heels and consequently your inner thigh and calf...not the saddle.|`|Mu1vMc7Maa	my saddle has velcro knee blocks. its really handy. i ride without mine on because my saddle has a lot of extra "saddle" infront of my leg and the knee blocks push my leg back even further then the build of the saddle does. its a Santa Cruz. (canadian saddlery) i love it, but its not good if you are trying to perfect leg position. though it worked fine when i was told to ride with all knee....|`|AA11353999	Hate them! Don't believe they are useful, just a crutch. Personally, I wouldn't put much stock in who ever told you that - that you must have knee blocks on your saddle to go over 3'6".     Good legs that are solid underneath you when you're in 2 point- yes.   And if you're not jumping for your horse (ahead of his/her motion) or getting left behind at the jump (behind the motion)- then yes, you're ready to go up.    I don't believe in having my students use any 'special' equipement for them to ride better or jump higher. Sooner or later you'll be without that stuff and have to do it on your own- but I'm 'old school' (lol). Better to learn how to do it without the extra stuff and save yourself some money as well!|`|Pn4nFohiaa	love them,
l3zdxJREaa	Pull the tail after exercise cos the pores are open and hairs come out easier.  1-Get your pulling comb and wind 3 or 4 strands around the comb. (ONLY pull from the sides of the tail cos otherwise the tail ends up looking thin and messy!!)  2-Pull the hair out really quickly in a downward motion.  3-Repeat until you've pulled as much as you want!  This just thins the tail. If you want it shorter your gonna have to cut the end.  hope this helps:)|`|f101IPi1aa	why would you pull a horses tail...most of the time a thicker tail helps makes the horse proportionate...I think you have it wrong..you pull the mane and I would ask someone to show you and not just do it yourself although its not hard but some horses dont like it.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	Most people don't pull their horses tails. Why would you want a thin tail anways? Just keep in natural xD|`|QpElKY8Kaa	Groom the tail free of tangles.    Starting with the longest hairs, take 2or 3 hairs.    Holding them at the bottom with one hand, slide your fingers up to the root end and give a quick, sharp pull.  (like plucking eyebrows)    Don't dawdle around, you'll only irritate the horse    Smooth the hars back into place and again take the longest 2 or 3 and holding from the bottom, slide up the hair to the root end and snap them out.      Repeat, repeat, repeat.    Check your length and shape often.      You may have to do this over a period of days as this may or may not make the tail sore.  Your horse will let you know. . .  = )|`|RloOJ43haa	Magic pretty much has the technique. I think that tail pulling hurts more than mane pulling, so you can only do a little at a time. The only discipline I know where people really trim the tail is dressage. They bang the tail near the fetlocks and will trim the sides of the tail only with clippers so that is lays down better between the buttocks.|`|6GehblM3aa	You don't pull a tail, you bang it (cut off the bottom a bit to shorted it).|`|7cm4dZVaaa	I dont' think anyone does that anymore.  Long, full tails seem to be the norm.  BUT, if you want to do it, you do it just like a mane.  Grab a small amount of the too long/too think hair, push back the the other hair and pull. To thin it, do a little on one side, and a little on the other side to keep it balanced, to shorten, pull the longest hair.  Most ppl do just cut it across the botton, though.|`|iz03uvV4aa	Yes - as the first poster said you dont "pull" a tail like you pull a mane. You Bang a tail. keeping is clean and trimming.  There are also special "cuts" you can do but ideally the best thing to do is to bang a tail - trim, keep clean and well groomed.  Thats the healthiest thing for a tail of any kind.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	You pull the tail using a very similar technique to pulling the mane. Using a pulling comb, start at the top of the dock and work your way down on each side of the tail. Ideally you would only pull a "bushy" tail and you are trying to make the tail look neater and more cared for. You want to pull out the hairs that are sticking out onto the horse's haunches (hard to describe, but if you look at your horse's tail you will know what I'm trying to say!). For a neat, finished look you can then bang the tail (recomended for eventers, jumpers, and dressage - NOT hunters). Working with a dry, detangled tail pull it steadily downwards until you have the entire tail in your hand. Lift the ends and with sharp scissors snip straight across. Shake the tail out, collect it again, and snip off any stray hairs. A banged tail should end just above or below fetlock level (depending on your preference and discipline - jumpers commonly have shorter tails while dressage horses have longer). A well trimmed/banged tail can make the horse look just as sharp as a pulled mane.|`|PEPWFGNGaa	You only do it at the top.  Here's an article about it for you    http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/horse-car...      Edit> Trolls again Pssssshhhhhht|`|pS8A05NTaa	i've never heard of pulling the tail before
wF52XMxAaa	Where are you, and what humidity does she experience?  Amazons commonly have problems in dry climates.  If that's the problem, a humidifier should fix it.    If she's not in a dry climate, see a vet.  If all her skin is too dry, there's something wrong.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Your parrot sounds like he has extremely dry skin.  Rubbing some Vitamin E oil on the feet can help.  It may be a normal condition if your house is very dry.  You may want to use a humidifier to moisten up your house, as well as reduce the amount of dry skin on the parrot's body.   If that doesn't work, then I'd suggest a visit to the vet.|`|v6coHbIeaa	You can see all the answer you got ,Take it to the vet.|`|AA11325614	take her/he to the vet|`|LkdZPgvjaa	Keep your creams and lotions to yourself.  It may be that one of those concoctions irritated the bird's feet even more.  If you put anything on those toes, use a natural aloe vera.  A bird's feet are reptilian and are supposed to be dry, but if you're sure your bird's feet are not the way it should be, and her skin is also dry, there is an aloe vera solution that can be given to her orally - and it's not commercially bottled for us to drink - it's specifically for animals - I don't remember but maybe exclusively for birds.  And it's expensive. I've heard tho' it does great things for skin and plumage.  Vitamin E is a miracle for our skin and I've used it on my birds with no problem but just double check with an avian vet if you decide to use it.  Remember too that what is on the feet, if the bird feels irritated, goes right in the beak and is ingested and please, please, please remember... this is a bird, not a little human child.  Don't use the stuff you use on yourself on your bird!  Stick to natural remedies and always check with an avian vet or licensed bird groomer if you're not sure of something.  In fact, I would take her to a good bird groomer - Instead of a vet -  and ask them about your bird's feet.  They'll know if it's a dietary thing or maybe something she steps in, or if after all, it may be completely normal and You are the one that needs to stop putting your facial stuff on your bird!|`|AA11174528	I remember reading somewhere that when a parrot has feet like that it means that they're dehydrated. Most birds won't drink dirty water (I have to wash my parrot's water dish everyday).   I give them extra water and cover their feet in galaxal base (not sure if that's how you spell it but whatever). I don't know if it's both or one but something works
qw9ZjAlDaa	My horse had some nasty cuts on his legs last year and got some proud flesh associated with them and I found this stuff called Equaide that worked AWESOME.  You put it on every other day or so and wrap it (they include all the stuff you need)...it works like a charm, very worth the money.    Let me find the link for you...    http://www.equaide.com/|`|IMPvzBk1aa	I'm posting an article that explains what proud flesh is all about.  The SMZ is an antibiotic and antiprotozoal medication to prevent infection while the proud flesh is treated.  Call your vet for any instructions on what to do while whatever the treatment she prescribed (hopefully not a caustic) is having its effect.  Proud flesh should only be treated with veterinary supervision.  It is highly vascular tissue, and is often removed surgically, which is usually the best treatment option.  Please call your vet for clarification and follow his/her advice, and not what you get from the internet.    http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.aspx...|`|bqbrKFeUaa	I would just call the vet and ask her all these questions. Sorry but not a lot of people on here are going to know what they are doing they might think they do but they don't. Just call and ask the vet will be happy to help.|`|RloOJ43haa	I thought your cousin was a vet. Why don't you call her?|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Do everything your vet told you to do and do not do anything they didn't tell you to do. Proud flesh can be very tricky to treat... the SMZ's are basically an antibitoic medication -- they will prevent infection and help the healing process. If you notice that the proud flesh is growing, call your vet immediately and have him/her come back out for a second look. Otherwise treat it as you where instructed.|`|sbB0TpGXaa	You scrub the scab off daily with clean water (no soap) and then coat with the wound powder.|`|N2jvxYPcaa	OH MY I JUST HAVE TO REPLY!  To the person who wants you to buy hair bleach, dilute it and then pour directly onto the horse's wound !!!!!AAARRRGGGGG!!!! I wonder why you would have to restrain or twitch the horse?!!!! Maybe we should grab that person, give them a large open wound, and then apply a diluted bleach solution onto their cut every day.  This sort of advice is exactly the reason why you should NOT ask people on Yahoo answers, or even local friends, how to treat wounds! People are crazy. Just because its an old wives tale does not mean it's effective. I have an old British vet book, and if you saw the cures for sick animals you would be amazed - they were feeding sick horses lard mixed with animal hair and caustic products, because they didn't know any better, they didn't have antibiotics, they didn't understand how bacteria and viruses grew and spread, they didn't understand how to prevent contamination, etc. They were doing the best they could, but they still weren't doing what helped. Alot of people's advice is no different - they honestly think they're helping, but they don't have a basic understanding of wound care, healing, etc.  Phone your vet and talk to her. It isn't unusual that people are overwhelmed when they hear health care instructions. Ask her your question when she has a moment or two to talk to you. Ask every question you can think of - make yourself a note so you can remember them when you talk. She will give you good advice.  As for picking off the scab every few days, once again, this isn't normally good advice. Yes, some types of wounds require "debriding" to rid the wound of thick debris. But this is done either surgically, by an experienced vet, or chemically, with certain types of medications applied to exactly the right location.   I also want to encourage you that you have done the right thing so far. You rescued a pony that needs you. You called the vet out. You now are asking people for advice. Just be careful that you continue on the right path - and be careful what advice you take.  I have to admit this is as close to a rant as I've ever had on Yahoo answers - I just can't believe some people's answers.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	Just leave it alone and make sure it's clean. My horse injured himself and he had proud flesh on his leg. I just waited and it eventually went away. My trainer said that if it didn't go away, she could just cut it out but thankfully she didn't have to.     I had some antibiotic ointment (that was the name of it..i just got it at the grocery store xD) and I just put that on the wounds.     Don't worry, your horse will be fine!    Good luck! =D|`|iz03uvV4aa	If your vet just said to apply the pounder - just do that. You shouldnt mess around with proud flesh as it will just continuously get bigger and you may just cause further infection. Keep it clean and just do as your vet has recommended and if in the first week or two you feel like there is no progress or for some odd reason it gets worse, it never hurts to just call and ask your vet :)  But I wouldnt ever recommend peeling any scab off and especially cutting off any proud flesh.  Prous flesh is really no big deal. It will heal istself in time - just do as your vet said and keep a close eye on it.    Good Luck :)|`|XHHkBkwOaa	some people may want to knock my idea but i got this from a 60 woman who has been breeding arabs for most of her life time and uses this all the time when you have over 300 arabians you don't want to be messing around with expensive products      got o the store and get some bleach HAIR BLEACH not the blue powdered stuff i mean blonde hair dye box with the bottle in it    take the bottle out DONT ADD THE COLOUR IN         get another container poor almost all of it into another container     now fill the bottle up with water till the top   restrain your horse NEED AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE UNLESS YOU HAVE A CRUSHER    have some white gauze please use gloves squirt the bleach directly onto and on the cut then get the gauze and wipe it clean of all the gunk     DO THIS DAILY NOTE::::: KEEP YOUR HORSE IN AN EASY TO CATCH PLACE !!!!    you may need a twitch depends on the horse    get some medical tape place a piece of gauze over the top and tape both ends this stops flys and other insects getting in and also helps to take the dry gunk off the wound as it will stick to the gauze...|`|rXI7CUXiaa	The most important thing is to keep it clean. It will need to breath and drain so you shouldn't wrap it and clean it atleast 2x's a day. If you can clean it more, feel free to. If you use hose water to clean it out, make sure to use some peroxide after and pat dry with a clean cloth. Sometimes the water can have microspocic organisims that may be an irritant. My vet gave me something called Azium (not sure if I spelled that correctly) In warmer months, after cleaning/drying you can also put meat tenderizer on it (it will keep the flies away)|`|b8vjXmnfaa	Keep doing what the vet told you to do. Call her in a few days if you are still worried. The worst that can happen is that you or the vet will have to cut it off. Cutting it off does not hurt them for there are no nerve endings there, but it is very bloody. My aunt was a vet tech and had to cut it off for her horse.|`|0nos1iXlaa	Haven't had to deal with proud flesh is some years, but if I recall we used something called "white's solution" I believe it was.  Got it from the vet.      To the person who is talking about hair color......You say you got this "tip" from some 60 yr. old gal?  Why would you need to do that?  I saw your answer in another question & under sources you stated 14 yrs. Equine Vet.....Now if you are an equine vet why do you need "tips" from other folks?  Also, your grammar & spelling do not scream VETERINARIAN......  Just curious....|`|WSO5K0wvaa	my vet gave me panalog and it worked great! I had to put it on daily and it is not cheap, but it was worth it.|`|ejj2N3uaaa	My horse just had an injury with terrible proud flesh this past fall...it was a pain to deal with, but it's barely there now.    In his case, it started with what seemed like a superficial cut--no lameness, swelling, etc. It was a long cut on his foreleg (running the length of his cannon bone) but the top and bottom of it healed up normally and quickly. The middle, however, soon expanded so that it was probably 3-4 inches wide instead of a half inch wide (which is what it started as). It swelled so that it looked like a baseball was in his cannon bone (very odd) and he had proud flesh coming out of it.     He was also on SMZs (an antibiotic) to prevent infection. We wrapped the injury to keep pressure on the proud flesh and prevent it from "growing" (it was disgusting and stuck out a good bit if not wrapped...if you unwrapped it and left it for fifteen minutes, it'd expand twice its size). The vet recommended that we use Red Jel on it as well.    Then we left it unwrapped for a very short period of time while I was cleaning his stall one day (I was going to rewrap/treat him after I finished) and he somehow scraped the proud flesh off. It bled terribly, but the injury was now even with his leg (well, the swollen leg...ha). There wasn't any proud flesh sticking out. The vet came back out and said that it actually wasn't a bad thing that he had done that--he'd basically done for himself what the vet would've done (removed the proud flesh), just slightly more messy. ha.    At that point, we started using a product called Underwoods Horse Medicine on it. This stuff is incredible. The Red Jel, Corona, Preparation H (the vet had recommended that as well), etc. was keeping it from getting worse, I guess, but it still wasn't healing up (even though the proud flesh was gone). We'd spray the Underwoods (underwoodhorsemedicine.com, I think) every day and apply baking soda over it. With that stuff, you don't wrap it--it forms its own "crust" over the wound. It literally started healing immediately (and this was after several months of no progress with everything else).    To further promote that stuff, my sister's horse went through a fence back in October and ripped all of the skin off above her knee. It was about as wide as my hand and extended around the front and both sides of her leg. She tore through some of the muscle as well. It was absolutely disgusting (and I watched the entire thing happen). We wrapped it and treated it according to the vet's instructions for weeks and saw no progress, even though she wasn't getting worse (and no proud flesh). The wrapping started to irritate her skin, so we decided to try the Underwoods so we wouldn't have to wrap. It was another miracle--she's nearly completely healed now, we didn't have to keep wrapping, and the "crust" that forms protects it just as well as wrapping does (without irritating the rest of her leg).     I'd ask your vet, though, to be more specific about what she recommended. If you are interested in using another product instead, ask her--she may be able to help.
qw9ZjAlDaa	Bauchers do NOT create more poll pressure.  The only way they are really different from a regular snaffle is that they are more stable in the horse's mouth.  This can be good or bad, depending on the horse.  Some horses feel trapped by not being able to adjust to/with the bit...some horses like the stability.    If your problem is your horse leaning/pulling on you, I would suggest the waterford.  I would necessarily go to the baucher form of it for the reason suggested above (he may feel trapped) but just start out with a regular waterford, probably with a D ring cheekpiece.    Ideally you want to use training to get your horse to get off your hands, not just use a bit as a shortcut, but I know that's often easier said than done.  As long as you have light hands and aren't pulling on his face, I think a waterford would be the best bet for your situation.    P.S.  Waterfords aren't allowed in all competitions, so keep that in mind.
TngHVcVXaa	i had 2 guiney pigs too but we fed them hay as a treat not an everyday thing and they turned out just fine and healthy too!  they lived to be 7 years old each!!!!|`|ayuXh7ZLaa	Hay is just a normal treat for guinea pigs and is healthy.  You can feed it to them everyday, but only up to 3 large servings.  If you have a non pesticide backyard/garden you can take grass from there, asl long as its green and healthy.|`|kGwMj5kcaa	They are supposed to get more than just hay everyday. They are supposed to get grains, vegetables, and hay everyday. I also have two (almost 2 year and 4 month old) They don't eat nearly that much. I give them two hands of timothy hay a day, 2 hands of grains, variety of vegetables and once in a while a little of an apple. They also like alfalfa. This makes them gain weight, so don't give them a lot. Oh and get used to buying hay and stuff cause they are two of them just not one. They eat double!    Best of luck with the guinea pigs!|`|OhpbLfdraa	MAY BE THEY LIKE IT A LOT BUT THEY DONT NEED IT EVERY DAY AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET USED TO NOT HAVINGIT EVERYDAY SO IT CAN LAST|`|MpVQE8tnaa	You can also feed them pellets too|`|JGq9rKBOaa	Buy a bale. Check local feed stores.    I get a bale of timothy hay for about 6 dollars - which is less than a bag at Petco.      If you don't know of any feed stores near you, you can order in bulk online, which is cheaper than buying the little bags from the store.     http://www.oxbowanimalhealth.com/product...   Oxbow also sells very good pellets, which are better than most brands in pet stores, so you could save a lot of money and get a better product by ordering your hay and pellets from them.     Same goes for Kleenmama's hay and pellets  http://www.kmshayloft.com/    They definitely need lots of fresh hay every day, but if you get it from the right place, it won't be too expensive.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	Well they need to have food everyday.. So you could get them something else like pellets.. and then go off and one feeding them pellets and hays.. I have 3 guinea pigs(4,2,1) and they don't nearly eat that much..|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	Timothy hay is mandatory for the health of their digestive  system. It also helps them with their teeth. there is innumerable nutrients  that they get from the hay. Once they have it all the time they spot gorging on it they must be really needing it so are over eating. they do however eat a lot of hay, if you have a pet you can figure out how to met its needs. Maybe you will need to get a paper route or something but their health comes first.|`|mxrlZEweaa	According to Dr. Curt Nakamura, an exotic vet specialist at Adobe Animal Hospital in Los Altos, California, grass hay is an important part of a cavy's diet:    "One of the most important items in the guinea pig diet is grass hay, which should be fed in unlimited quantities to both adults and baby guinea pigs. It is important to provide an unlimited source of hay because pellets do not provide enough long fiber to keep their intestines in good working order. The long fibers stimulate muscle contraction of the intestines to improve and maintain gut motility (to prevent gastrointestinal obstruction). Chewing hay is also important. Like rabbits, the molars in guinea pigs are constantly growing and must be ground down by chewing. Constant chewing on hay promotes healthy and normal wear on their molars. Treats and chew sticks are not efficient at wearing the teeth.|`|VW9fVQouaa	ok same with my guinea pig... ur gonna have to give them a reasonable amount of hay if u have two piggies i would give them ehhh two big hand fulls. and wat ur gonna do is ur gonna give them that amount of hay in the morning before u go to school and then at night before u go to bed.  yes yes i know seems kinda harsh but then this way ur guinea pig will learn a routine of wen and wat time they get their hay!  but ur gonna wanna feed them in that routine everyday. guinea pigs are my life and i would do almost anything for my piggie!  
X1LlP5KPaa	They won't suffocate from living in a tank but rats are extremely prone to respiratory illness and it will probably give them respiratory infections and severely shorten their lifespan.  The ventilation is too poor.  Get them a wire cage with multiple levels.  Check a rat cage calculator such as http://www.rattycorner.com/odds/calc.sht... to see if the cage you intend to buy is big enough.  And, I assume you have never had rats before, do a TON of research about rats.  They are high maintenance pets that require a great deal of work to live happy and healthy lives.  They need to be let out of their cage to run around a rat-safe room for at least an hour a day.  They need to be fed fresh fruits, vegetables, and grains daily.  Please join goosemoose.com, a rat forum, for any questions you have and please DO RESEARCH.  If you have any qualms at all about how much time you are going to be able to spend on them, then do not get rats.  Get a hamster.    -And you should tell your friend that rats should never be kept alone.|`|4hDP0Xqaaa	Yes I would get the cage instead of the tank mostly because cages have way better air ventilation than tanks do.  Getting a cage would also be better for your rats health because since air ventilation is bad in tanks, the ammonia from their urine can really build up and cause your rats to get a respitory disease.    Also if you get a cage, your rats can climb on the bars and reach different levels in it if it has them.|`|6W4ZWOetaa	A tank is a horrible idea for pet rats.      The reason why is because their pee has a lot of ammonia in it.  Rats have delicate respiratory systems, and when the ammonia builds up and can't ventilate well they can get infections, and may die.  I know that sounds awful, but it's true.    Also, tanks are usually way to small for your rats to get enough exercise.  You should get a cage that has a few floors with ladders for running around.    One other thing is that rats really like to interact with you, and the outside world.  A cage lets them do that much more easily.      Just think about it, would you rather be in a cage with free flowing breezes and lots of room and ladders to run up and down, or would you rather be in a hot stuffy tank that smells really horrible and has nowhere to climb?      Also, what kind of bedding did he buy?  Since the woman at the pet store obviously has no clue how to take care of rats... make sure that it's either carefresh bedding, or aspen that has no aromatic oils.  Pine and Cedar are TERRIBLE for your rattie's lungs.|`|WKA3mmBQaa	Never keep rats in a cage and NEVER trust what a person at the pet store has to say!! Even if they act like they know what they are talking about, they probably think it is true. A tank wouldn't suffocate them, but rats need ventalation and the tank could cause an infection that could be deadly. I suggest buying a Martin's Cage.|`|2FoMlJnLaa	Unless you vacuum seal the top and duct tape the lid closed...    they should live.|`|g9DWi0DKaa	as long as it has some type of air holes dont worry but if it dosent u need a new cadge|`|CRRlESW0aa	Tank|`|oGVWdnHraa	They can live in tanks, just as long as they have a wire lid so there is pleanty of ventialtion :) Tanks are also easier to clean than cages, so that is one benefit of them :)    I personally prefer wire cages because you can hang stuff on the sides and off the roof :)|`|q2AsDnjpaa	Either will work fine. You may need to have a mesh top so that it will allow air to circulate.|`|LydL7EN6aa	cages are better for ventilation, def go get a cage... does ur bf still have the reciept? let him know nicely so he doesnt feel bad... lol tell him you did your research so he cant argue with it|`|gTXUcd1maa	Yeah terrible idea. Don't even try it. Get a cage with a plastic bottom.Good luckk!!|`|ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	The only air that they will get is from above.  They won't suffocate as long as you don't seal the top of put something on the top, other than the screen to keep him in.  If it were me, I would get a cage so he gets air from all sides.|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	Glass or metal tank and how big is the opening. Keep the cage option until you see if they get comfortable with the tank. Talk with some people at the local humane society about what would best for the rats.      Happy Birthday and enjoy your new pets!|`|8HDjHBceaa	make sure to keep the cover off !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       anything else ?  I hope you never breed.|`|K97esxDsaa	I don't think they'd suffocate, but I don't think a tank could provide enough space for rats.    Rats should have a fairly large space, both vertically and horizontally. I don't think a glass aquarium could provide a suitable environment.    You can get a nice big cage with 2-3 levels that will be better for the rat and far easier to clean for under $50 if you shop around.|`|ci4G6W0Waa	yes why would put a rat in a tank its not a fish its suppose to be in a cage not in a tank|`|2opWeKQBaa	I don't think that'll be hurtful to them at all. just make sure they get plenty of fresh air. since it's glass, and thats how pet stores house them... i don't see why it's a problem. They can't climb glass. But you should get things for them to climb on. and if you think they are gonna get out, then get a wire mesh lid ;p
PSyVB2UDaa	I have a hammy named Chewie, and i taught her to go places in her cage on command. I did this by saying the name of the place when she went there. for example: if i wanted her to go on her ramp thing when she went there naturally i said "go to the ramp Chewie" and so on. i also taught her to shake her paw by holding a sunflower seed up and then when she tried to get it i got one paw and put it on my finger. I hope i helped!

kjW1fmmPaa	Call the vet (no charge for calling them for advice) and ask if they could give you some sort of payment plan, if you can give $50 or something in advance and pay the rest within time.      Or, if need be, bring your pets to the humane society/ASPCA.  They may be able to help you out for a cheaper price, but if you still cannot afford it, then you could sign ownership of the animals over to the care of the ASPCA, who would then proceed with the euthanization or treatment, after examination.    Good luck, I know these are trying times and I am glad you are not going to let your animals suffer just because of your own financial issues.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	I just had to put my 14 yr cat down. I know the pain. How sad to have so many at one time. I'll bet even money could'nt save them if they are old. It would be kinder to let them "go home". (My term for heaven). Here in Upstate NY it costs about $40 for an office visit and around $10 or 15 to put them to sleep. And you say it is $175 for each??? Holy crap! I never heard it costing that much. Are you sure???  Can you go to a small nearby town and pay less??? Good luck. And if you can afford it, do get a great book called COLD NOSES AT THE PEARLY GATES. There is a one and a two. I recommed the FIRST one!

bFzu835Aaa	It's up to the birds individual personalities, NOT if they're male/female. The same is true for any species. I personally only have one grey, but a friend has 3. 2 are female, one is a male, they all get along. Don't go by gender for any bird getting along questions. It's all personality of the individual birds.
VMY7No0eaa	no what you are discribing is crystal or URINARY TACT INFECTION.  GET SOME cranberry pills and give them 3 in one day  or put some lemon drops into the water (about 3or4)    You may HAVE TO take him to the vet ... because the UTI will kill him.  and is VERY painful!   they will put a cathiter up his __ and drain the blatter then give you some antibiotics.  You will need to change food too  change to one that says "good for urinary tract health) 9 lives has one.|`|nvWvOyl6aa	yes, she might have prostate problems and since she is infected, don't let her use the same litter box as your other 2 cats because they might get the same disease. put her a separate litter box until you take her to the vet and until she get better.    hope this helped!|`|BBZj7m0kaa	TAKE HIM TO A VET IMMEDIATELY SOS.

XJ9oSR2daa	I pay $75 typically for mine, so your in the ballpark.    I fully believe in chiropractic work and use it on my show mule reguarly for a shoulder issue after a collar injury driving.    Right now, i have an accupressurist coming to help me with that mule and his 1/2 sister that was just diagnosed with pedal osteitis.. we are still doing the pads and shoes and she isn't lame right now, just trying to prevent it degrading as much as I can.      I do maintence accupressure points on my guys right now and they preform so much better, I can definately tell when they need it.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Sorry to hear about the fire, that is terrible! =( My horse has had multiple chiropractic appointments. $81 is quite reasonable. The best advice I have to offer is get to know the person who will be working on your horse before you let them actually start their work. Have them explain exactly what they will be doing, what changes you should expect, what you should look for, etc. Ask if there is anything you can do yourself (such as stretching exercises). Also ask (as tactfully as possible) what their credentials are. Are they certified? Do they work in the area at any other farms you might know? Chiropractic work can do wonders for your horse but in the wrong hands, it can be very harmful. I didn't question the first chiropractor who came out to do my guy and he was lame for a week afterwards. Needless to say, I didn't call her back! Good luck. You're horse is going to feel very pampered. =)|`|ZTCspx5saa	I am a horse fan and was wondering what is a  chiropractic app? I am so sorry about the barn fire|`|Hexqwm58aa	from waht i human chiro.s cost it seems like a good deal to me. horses are generally more expensive. generally human appoiintments can range any were from $34-$106, so $81 for a horse doesnt seem too bad.    i give my horse mini chiropractic "appiontments" myself. when seems sore in his withers and in lion area, i take a spur and run it down his back. it works well actually...|`|EQvAbyvcaa	yes, that is really inexpensive.
GdBG4PGYaa	No, it has no affect on humans.     It is just a minty flavored plant to humans. To cats this is what they live for! It makes them roll around, meow, and be really affectionate! :)      Hope I helped!|`|RXI8ImdIaa	No , it has no effect on humans.|`|OaQWUfNoaa	No. Catnip has no affect on humans. It is a plant in the Mint family. And it only affects some cats- some will play with it and it will make them act like a kitten/high, others will just eat it and some will completely ignore it. It just depends on the genetics.|`|PCsW0gbPaa	It can have an effect on humans if smoked in high doses.  But it's nothing to write home about.  It's one of the ingredients they use in the "legal herb" stuff that you may have seen advertised.|`|GChSvLtIaa	No! Stop getting high peroid - one day it wont work and you will still be hooked and a slave.|`|HvOJ182qaa	i doubt it....    your question takes me back to when my dad picked up a packet of cat nip drops id left on the kitchen shelf, and he actually ate about 5 of them!

y7igESfUaa	Try high quality foods like Merrick, Wellness, Innova, Natural Balance, Solid Gold, etc. The better quality the ingredients, the more gets digested (and used) and less comes out as waste. Stay away from foods like Fancy Feast, 9Lives, Whiskas, Friskies, etc. These foods are lower quality and more will come out as waste (and she will have to eat more to get the nutrients that she needs). However, usually a diet high in protein (which a cat needs) causes smelly poop in the box. Either way, good luck to you.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Try a high-quality food free of by-products and glutens.  Smelly poops are usually a sign that something isn't getting digested well, and if her food's got either of those two fillers in it, that may be your source.  Fish is another possibility as well.  Try her on a basic but top-notch chicken based food like Wellness, Innova, Natural Balance, or Merrick, and see if that doesn't make a difference.|`|HMgRFOhqaa	Good cat-litter, and good dry food, (not canned) be persistent, your the boss...|`|Gj47yTKvaa	antifreeze    Kidding|`|qv7T6MJ2aa	I highly recommend EVO canned!

There's a store locator on all of their websites.     You could also feed raw but you need to do a lot of research on it. Raw food creates odorless cat poop.

Just remember to introduce the new food slowly to avoid digestive upsets.    It wouldn't hurt to have a fecal analysis done to rule out parasites.    It's actually great that you're going with canned food - it's easier to digest so usually produces less smelly poo anyway.|`|AA11767019	Stop smelly poops by feeding an all-raw diet to your cat.

However I have noticed when i give my cat a can of wet catfood (as a treat I give him one can a week) his poopy stinks more.  you are suppose to feed cats dry catfood. its way healthier for them. && i noticed the poop stinks less when his primary food is dry.  Arm and hammer clumping cat litter ROCKS. I live in a small apartment, and it cuts the odor down A LOT. GOOD LUCK.|`|a9Syspyiaa	The really bad smells are usually from unabsorbed fats.  Try to find a brand with lower fat content.  Also, you could try dry food, but never switch brands immediately, let her have both for a few days so she gets used to it.    No matter what you do, it will not be a pleasant scent.  I recommend turning on a vent then either changing the litter box or covering it with a handful of clean litter.
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    Before we all jump to conclusions, is this a Syrian (Teddy Bear, Golden, Honey Bear, Panda) or a dwarf hamster?      If it's a dwarf it CANNOT be wet tail (the dwarfs are a different genera and species than the Syrians so they're genetically immune) although it could still be something else.Wet tail generally looks like diarrhea - not pus.     I'm going to ask you a few questions and if you can answer them by sending me an email through YA or update your question here, I'll watchlist your question, OK?    1.  What color is the "pus" Is it greenish/brown, or is it yellowy/white?  2. If he's rocking, he could be in shock.  Does he appear to be in pain or freaked out?  3. Have you seen him eat, drink, pee or poo since you put him back in his cage?    This really *doesn't* sound like wet tail to me.  Sometimes hamster pee, especially in males is milky yellow in color and it's not noticeable in the cage as much as it would be on another surface.     But just in case here are the signs of wet tail (I'm not a vet - so I want to give you all the possibilities): I do think your hamster is in shock though so whether it's wet tail or not, he'll need some major TLC :)    1. Greenish/brown liquid poo, not just under the tail, but ALL over the back end of the hamster.  2. Hunched, painful looking walking - like a scrunched up accordion  3. Dehydration - sunken eyes, loose skin.    If you think that this is the case, do NOT buy the pet store medications, they kill more hamsters than the wet tail itself does because they're broad spectrum antibiotics and kill ALL the bacteria, good or bad, in your hamster.    If it's wet tail, you need a vet - the sooner the better.    In the meantime you need to keep your hamster hydrated - here's how:    1. Get a baby syringe or eyedropper.    2. Buy some pedialyte.  If you can't find that, grab some honey.    3. Mix the pedialyte 50/50 with water.  If you're using honey, add a tiny bit to the water until it's just sweet to the taste.    4. Drip this slowly into your hamster's mouth.  Don't force it or you could push the liquid into its lungs - very bad.    5. If the hamster responds to this - you'll need to do it every couple hours - you can move on to the next step.    6. Get some pea & ham baby food. It's best because it has 2 proteins, starch and some simple sugars.    7. Mix it with water until it's a thin consistency that you can draw easily into the dropper/syringe.     8. Again, drip this into the hamster's mouth, and don't force it.    The hamster may actually lick the water and/or food mixtures off the syringe/dropper.  This is good.    This will not CURE the wet tail, you need the proper medication from the vet, but dehydration ends up killing more hamsters with wet tail or just regular diarrhea because they lose so much water.    Remember, I'll be watching for updates, but it would be best if you could send me a msg directly with the information so I'll see it faster :)    I'll do anything I can to help you :)    Daisy|`|LGDpt4jUaa	Take him to the vet. My hamster died of wet tail and i gave him the drops. It didnt do anything and he ended up dying anyway. So your best chance is to take him to the vet.|`|cDz6jxxnaa	It`s possible he has wet tail. which is a very serious disease. You might want to take him to the vet ASAP cuz wet tail will kill a hamster within 24-48 of symptoms being noticed|`|COMOAbB3aa	I know exactly what you are talking about. It is a serious hamster disease and kills them in a matter of days. They have some medicine at the pet store for only like 7 dollars. Since your hamster has it you put about 4 drops in the dropper that comes with it and put it into your hamsters mouth and feed it to her. After your hamster overcomes wet tail[the disease] you should look up on the internet or get a book on what to do after the hamster gets it. Afterwards they need special treatment.|`|sjrDRS65aa	IT looked at ur face|`|MZ3EgGOpaa	wow courtney, bitchy *** response.. i think you should get him to a vet asap :) goodluck
XurYYreBaa	If the 2 girls are getting along that well, it should be ok to leave them together.  The same thing happened to us a few years ago & since we didn't know any different, we left our 2 does together.  The non-pregnant doe actually behaved like an "auntie" to the babies, even pulling them back to the nest box when they wanted to explore.  Keep an eye on them though, in case the mama rat becomes nervous or irritable, which I've heard *can* happen.  Keep the are around the cage as stress-free as possible, provide lots of good food, fresh water & extra nesting material.  It's usually fine to handle the pups right away.  I began handling ours within 24 hrs & they knew me by the time their eyes opened (around 2 weeks of age).  Good luck.|`|yAlyAt8Zaa	I wouldnt. There could be a disease that comes with the pregnancy. I would take the other rat out. Also, if the other rat tries to go just a little near the other rat, she mite fight with the other rat, just to protect her babies. This COULD lead to death!!!    Hope this was what you were looking for!|`|TTs6GBBUaa	Since they've been together for a long time you should leave her in there. They wont fight the non-pregnant rat will help take care of the mom's litter when she has to go get food/ water etc. she will act like a nanny. Also about introduceing then to your older rats. They shouldnt fight if you let them play together in the bath tub for about an hour or so then put them in the cage with them. Also before you put them in the cage together clean it really well first. By the way There is no disease that spreads through prengancy if one has a disease the other will have it anyway from liveing with her it's whole life.  Where do you live? If you live in S.A texas I'll take in the pregnant female for you.|`|X1LlP5KPaa	You need to get a closed in pregnancy cage like an aquarium.  That is the only time I would ever recommend getting an aquarium for rats.  The babies are so tiny that they can slip through pretty much any wire cages.  And leave the buddy in the old cage or quarantine and intro her to your other rats.  Having another rat in the cage will stress our your new mom rat.  They probably won't fight or anything, but you want to keep the baby-raising as stress-free as possible.|`|IzRk1mZQaa	I would separate them as well.  Buddy might get tense with all the activity and eat the babies, and there is always a chance of disease.|`|XliM2cWaaa	I'm not sure what you should do with the other rat, but don't leave it in the same cage with the mother and babies, once it has given birth. It may eat the babies.
xGmbEzOZaa	Each individual bird is different. Some sun conures are louder than nanday conures, and vice-versa.     However, I know many people who think that sun conures are a bit louder.|`|v6coHbIeaa	sun,|`|xXeLkkqqaa	I would say Sun is.|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	Since you are considering 2 of the noisier conures you might also consider a gold capped conure. I have a gold capped and a nanday . I heard a sun a few times and I would say it is louder and more persistant than a nanday. Mine only lets out a few shrieks a day. He is going on 24 years and I have had him for 19.    EDIT----Yes there are ways to teach your bird not to scream. The first rule is if you will only have a free hour or two to socialize with your bird ,don't smother it with 8 hours of attention when you first get it and then suddenly drop it to 1 hour a day.That will lead to screaming for sure. Get yourself a few books ,do some research and you'll be fine.|`|1tOr2qLAaa	I have always heard that a Sun Conure is the loudest. I think people get them because they are so pretty, and then end up being sorry or buy ear plugs.  I have a Nanaday, who for the most part is very quiet, if she sees someone walking up the walkway she squawks and around 3:00p.m. too. I just cover her for a bit and she is quiet. When I had her at my other house, she was in the sun room and was always quiet because she only looked out in the back yard. I don't think socializing is going to help, I think the Sun is just naturally a little louder and more often.
f728e94b65d843c5fb54f38880df0092aa	We love our beagle mix -   he stays at home alone from 8:30 a.m. until 6:p.m. every day - he doesn't have accidents, etc. (although sometimes he knocks over the garbage) - he is a very happy dog and suggest beagles.  They are very friendly and loving.  Beagles are pack animals and they do like company (getting 2 would be best) - after you have them for a while they will think of you as part of their pack.    When you do get home, plan on long walks - they need their exercise.|`|d0a6ff0af5c6f40dd145ae8604ecfaacaa	I would suggest not. Beagles require a lot of social activity, and can be very destructive if they are left alone. This applies to all dogs, but some breeds are worse than others. I have an 8-month old mix breed puppy (poodle and American Eskimo) that I have to leave while at work, but I also have three cats to keep her company and that seems to be okay. She hasn't damaged anything in the house (other than some minor chewing on the living room carpet), and she seems pretty happy. If you can have only one dog and have to leave it alone, I'd suggest adopting an adult dog.|`|86e5af1e3ecd8e843ceaec78bb2640ffaa	Beagles can be wonderful house pets or hunting dogs.   12 hours is a long time if you  keep him in a crate, if this   is what you plan on doing , get someone to let him out to potty   a couple of times a day when nobody is home or consider a    doggie care center.  Otherwise it's unfair to the dog.  all dogs   need exercise and human companionship as well as food & water.|`|AA10223685	If you like hunting get a beagle...|`|5945ff65c862c03506285b091c7ed537aa	why dont you ask a vet about it?|`|163b70ebc48c821931eed11f6e2b5c53aa	you better of getting  a cat you silly twatt|`|7a970d3de7c508c11aad515aa8e52a67aa	NO.  beagles need alot of attention.  i have 2.  they are too intelligent for their own good.  and very emotional|`|AA10702864	NO all dogs need lots of attention and love but up to 6 hours is fine|`|5a9402f23078ae2a76528126f0b74f56aa	um... I don't know, what I would do is go to the library and et some books on Beagles and read up to see of those kind of dogs need a lot of attention. But I'd get an adult cause if your gone that long every day the puppy wll feel neglected and that's not good...I wouldn't even get an animal if your gone that long. Even f it is an adult it will be very lonly and get depresed.|`|e2afa6ecfa7eac50398c3255b69581d7aa	IT DEPENDS ON HOW LONG YOU PLAN TO HAVE HIM IN A KENNEL IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE ONE.  IF YOU USE A KENNEL YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE YOUR DOG IN IT FOR MORE THAN 4 HOURS ANYTHING OVER 4 IS IN-HUMANE.  BEAGLES ARE GENERALLY A HIGH ENERGY BREED THEY NEED LOTS OF EXERCISE EITHER THROUGH PLAY OR WALKING.  IF THEY DON'T GET ENOUGH EXERCISE THEY MAY HOWL AT ALL HOURS OF THE DAY AND NIGHT AND POSSIBLY DISTURB YOUR NEIGHBORS DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE. IF YOU DO GET ONE AND CHOOSE TO USE A KENNEL ALWAYS MAKE SURE HE HAS PLENTY OF FOOD AND WATER.  A FEW TOYS WOULDN'T HURT EITHER.  MAKE SURE IF HE IS OUTDOORS THAT HE WON'T BE EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND IF HE IS INSIDE MAKE SURE HE WON'T BE RIGHT BY A HEAT SOURCE WHERE HE COULD GET TOO WARM OR BURN HIS NOSE TRYING TO SNIFF THE HEAT SOURCE.  ALSO, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT:  MAKE SURE YOU KEEP HIS KENNEL CLEAN NO MATTER WHERE YOU HAVE IT.|`|efaba9fe806cad043a546602b0dbd759aa	you probably shouldnt because my dog is always arouond me and when i go to school she starts whinning as i go out the door
AA11853631	I don't know about calming the shepherd down since yorkies are pretty hyper, but the 2 dogs should get along well together. At first, you need to really watch them closely, supervise their play until they get used to each other and make sure the shepherd is not too rough with it.|`|86e5af1e3ecd8e843ceaec78bb2640ffaa	i would supervise them at all times. A big dog may hurt a   dog that small but not necessarily on purpose but because of  the size difference. As for calming her down i doubt it. Exercise   that big dog, a tired dog is a good dog.|`|AA11622449	yeah but at first it might take a while to settle them down..|`|834b8cb7b50e2e6cd40ba88691bb9fb4aa	Ye, they just have to get to know eachothert first. keep your eye on them, and goodluck.|`|15eb93374707509967abb0e095acb1cfaa	Yes the size of the dogs does'nt matter. Just introduce them slowly and give them time. They could very well end up being the best of friends.|`|AA12054456	getting another dog (regardless of size) is not the solution to calm your existing dog down, but if introduced properly, they should get along well together.|`|e2545f31ed8facb706c34a6b81793f94aa	I don't know if the Yorkie will calm down your German Shepherd any, but they should definitely get along.  Each of my big dogs get along with my parent's Shih-Tzu and in-law's Mini-Schnauzers just fine.  Keep your eye on them at first to make sure the shepherd isn't being aggressive.  good luck!
27d2fe79dd9df7b907483b0eb75c1a39aa	In most likely hood it is like that for good.  I have a friend with a husky that has one ear down now.  Its really rather cute|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Does he scratch at his ears or shake his head a lot?  He may have had a haematoma (blood blister) in his ear.    There's not much you can do except wait and see if it comes back up.  Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.  A haematoma can damage the ear so it won't stand properly.|`|4563238ee83df0abccd3ccf3e39ce11eaa	The dog's ear could be permanently damaged, but to make sure the VET would tell you better and may be able to do something about it.|`|c95e01313149f778813f0c7944193b55aa	yes|`|944c894f7e550a8c436f7d19c9019056aa	With up eared dogs, if the ear is played with too much as a pup it will not stand up. If it is injured in any way and flops over it will not stand back up.  Good luck.|`|f464a569517bd592a904db90e83e43c0aa	Ask your vet.  If it was a hematoma (swelling from ear trauma), it probably won't stand up the way it did before.|`|9b02824b1c7571f992f9dae76205e367aa	I've seen people attach playing cards to dog's ears in order to support the weak cartilage and help them stand up straight. From what I hear it works. I had a Dog with one floppy ear and one that stood up, and I thought it was the cutest thing, so I left it.|`|6b38a010227d5aa3484fe7a9290da767aa	I'd ask the vet on an expert opinon on this, but you should tape a peice of cardboard or something flat to it's ear to make it stand up.

AA10072754	They are a small, longhair dog with a small muzzel.  They have somewhat triangle ears that are down but may look floppy if you keep the fur long.  A tzu's fur should be soft and not thin.  The fur will grow down to the ground if not clipped and can be hard to handle.  In some cases they will have missing teeth that are noticalbe (not born with).    The shih tzu has a range of personalities.  No two dogs are alike.  Some like to bounce around while others are 100% lap dog.   All are quite outgoing.    The get along with dogs that get along with them.  Also with other pets.    UPKEEP:  here's what kills people    Unless you want to brush that fur every day which can take up to 30 mins per dog, regular grooming is a must.  I had mine shaved every 2 months and even then...his fur still got quite long.      eyes need whiping every other day or so.  Because they have big huge eyes....stuff often flies in them.    I would suggest cleaning the teeth too.    I dont know if this is true but...with the tzus I had....they did not take well to some dog foods.  Actually natural food worked the best for them.  It seems their digestive system is sensitive.|`|2044c80b753587e33e0a0e8b35f03b88aa	I have one. Here is a link to go see her. She is the sweetest, smartest dog. I love her to pieces. I have 6 dogs.

She is the most loving, sweet, and trusting dog I have ever been around.  Her name is Gizmo because she looks like the "nice" gremlin from the mid-80's movie Gremlins.  She is black and white  with the characteristic flat face and turned up nose.  When she sits and looks at you, her tongue sticks out a little.  She can be quite funny.  Remember, though - dogs are like children.  Each is different from the other.  Therefore, a dog you get may not be like Giz.    I have had interesting and intelligent poodles before but the one I currently have is a big doofus.  He's silly and dumb but I love him just the same.  That's my Taz.  The point is that dogs are the proverbial chocolates in the box.  They can be something totally different from what you expect.

What if you don't show AKC?  What if you have a rare breed that is not AKC recognized?  What if you have a dog that cannot be shown due to an injury?    It does not make a bit of difference if your dog is 14 with a heart condition, your dog will need to be S/N.  The animal rights groups and misguided do-gooders pushing this crap couldn't CARE LESS if your dog dies on the operating table.  They just want to stop breeding, ALL breeding as a step towards ending all animal ownership    Make dog breeding next to impossible and then wonder why they have a problem with sick, smuggled Mexican puppies.  Idiots.|`|AA10072754	Some cities have already passed that law and you can keep an unaltered show dog if you have proof of kennel club registration, show history, and you pay extra for a license to own them unaltered.

I feel all animals, if not being used for breeding use should be altered.|`|b9c24dbbcab2b414fec9d168d925b5acaa	I totally agree we should do something|`|AA11356387	no|`|c5f855e896d53d558bc3bf92c7230666aa	i agree with Baa Baa Blac.
W0ZQQK4taa	Hi Mutt! Yes, it should be fine, I was thinking about partially raw feeding Chuckles and doing that, but the raw in the morning.    Tell Tiger 'hi' for me!|`|26PPwzrWaa	Yes. You just want to wait 12 hours to feed raw.|`|OFpl236faa	I think that possible doing it just some days could confuse his system, might not affect him but something to be aware of. So if you are considering this, I would do it every morning just so it's consistent. Or is there a way to make his raw portion the night before? I know a lot of people who will make meals ahead for their dogs while traveling. Just a thought.|`|TWfDAYK4aa	I have fed a raw/kibble mix in the past and my dogs did fine on it.  They got 1 lbs raw with a half cup kibble.    I would think he would be okay with it.  If you have been feeding strictly raw for a while now, he might have a little loose stool, but shouldn't be too big a problem.  As for the preparing of the raw, why not prepare it ahead of time.  My one friend prepares a week's worth, and freezes what she would need for towards the end of the week, just to be sure it is still okay for consumption.  But, TOW and Wellness are good quality foods, so I don't think it should be a big problem.|`|e9i7RBrbaa	Blue wilderness states that there as close to the raw diet then any other brand they just add nutrients the dog needs. try blue wilderness.|`|AVBbj2QBaa	of course i have 2 german Shepperd's 2 pit bulls it wont hurt him at all...............|`|eTsCJYALaa	I used to feed my dog raw and we would order pints of meat/veggie mixes from a raw dog food company for this same reason. Just scoop it out and you are good to go. You could make this yourself and put it in the freezer and only thaw out what you need.|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	I, personally, would prefer to do it the other way around, raw in mornings, because as you know, kibble digests pretty slowly.    If I were in that predicament-- I would just fast my dog the breakfast-- and feed him both the breakfast and the dinner portion all at once in the evenings.|`|KxjUim7yaa	If you have to, i don't see why it wouldn't work. That is good kibble. I usually prepare my dogs food, but it is an involved process and I can't do it while traveling. I test tried a good kibble and the acceptance was good.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	when feeding raw you dont HAVE to feed twice a day
yoaWcfGvaa	By the time you notice a guinea pig is pregnant, it is likely that she will give birth soon.  If you have any other guinea pigs, they need to be separated as soon as possible.  Your guinea pig will give a distinctive groan when she is going into labor - even if you've never heard it before, when you hear it you'll know exactly what it means. Wait by her cage while she gives birth in case you need to intervene, but don't intervene unnecessarily. Labor is often short - when you hear the groan, the first baby may have already arrived.    Animals have an instinctive knowledge of what to do when the babies arrive, so you probably wont need to intervene - but stand by just in case. The mother will nip each amniotic sac, allowing the baby to breathe air, and then she will lick the baby clean. But if two babies arrive close together, she can only tend to one of them, and that is when you may need to step in.    * If the baby is still inside the sac, nip the sac with your fingernails, and free the baby's head.  * If it is breathing and moving, leave it for the mother. If it is not breathing or moving, pick it up, and holding it at arms length with its head away from you, spin around once. The force should free any blockages from its throat, and start it breathing.  * When all the babies are breathing and moving, put them back with the mother, for her to clean and to bond with.    Guinea pig babies should be furry and should be able to walk about with their eyes open within the hour - if not, something may be wrong, and you should take them to a vet. They don't require any special food, and it's fine if they eat the adult guinea pig food. Make sure fresh water is available, as the new mother will need to drink more than usual to make milk.    Remove males from mother as young as three weeks. The female babies can stay with the mother into adulthood, or be re-homed at around seven weeks.|`|ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	Blue, I did not have anything to do with your guinea pig being pregnant. If the babies look like me, it's just a coincidence, honest!    Brightest Blessings,  Raji the Green Witch|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	You really need to pay special care to the mom to be and make sure that she has a perfect diet and vitamins in her water, and make sure you change it every day so it does not lose its strength. Pretty much just like a human she needs to be kept calm fed well, always have plenty of water and she should do just fine.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	The second answer was terrific.     I'll just add one or two things.     Her pregnancy will last anywhere from 59 to 73 days. The usual litter will consist of 2-4 babies.     They will nurse from their mother, but can be capable of nibbling at solid food like moistened pellets within 2 days.     The nursing will continue for about 3 weeks, then the babies will eat their "adult" food.|`|IzRk1mZQaa	As soon as they get big enough to stop nursing, separate boys and girls, call a pet store to see if they want some guinea pigs cheap, and in the meantime, keep the cage really clean.  They are very small and pink and easy to miss during a cleaning.  Make sure mama pig has plenty of fresh water and food - have fun!!
lyocWukKaa	Try using spell check and maybe I could answer your question.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	Dog will see a seizure as a sign of weakness and attack. It doesn't matter the breed, many types of dog breeds will attack a seizing dog.  That said, an attack by a pitt is a bit more serious than an attack by a terrier.   Is your other dog on medication for the seizures? What breed/size is the other dog? Do they get along fine when there are no seizures happening? I think, from your door scratching explanation that they don't.  You should think about re-homing one of your dogs. I'm sorry, you could try an animal trainer... and stronger meds to control the seizures, but to be honest i don't think this is happening "only" during seizures. Good luck.|`|Lv8WlCPTaa	No offense, but pitt bulls are one of the species of dogs I hate, along with Australian Cattle Dogs.  They were bred to attack other dogs, and that behavior is even in their name Pitt Bull.  They were like bulls in a dog fighting pitt.|`|W02kTOqmaa	pit bulls were bred to be fighting dogs. As sweet as they are, you can't escape the instincts that were bred in to them. Although they are incredibly friendly to humans, pits are very animal aggressive because they were bred to be fighting dogs. If not raised with other animals from they time they are puppies, then they very rarely get along. And even if they are they can still attack. You should look at rehoming one of the dogs. It may be hard, but better that then your pit killing the other dog.    Pits do best in single animal homes|`|GLsCVPCuaa	just a note: apbt did not get their name because they "were bred to fight like bulls in the pitt" or whatever GUERILLA said...totally wrong|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	American Pit Bull Terriers WERE bred to be dog aggressive-- this is something that usually shows itself in this breed.    Some dogs can, and do get along (like my 3 American Pit Bull Terriers) but others just can't... it varies.    You should consider rehoming the pit into a family where he'll be the only dog, or struggle the rest of their lives trying to keep them separated and safe.|`|lB732Tiyaa	I think of pits like any other dog. They are smart and can be well trained. It's all about the way that the dog is raised and socialized. As for the attacking - it could be fear. I would consult an animal behaviorist to see if they could help.|`|6qAq5LrUaa	he might sence there is something wrong with your other dog and it scares him|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	So your pit attacks the other dog when he has seizures. Maybe its because your pit doesn't know what to make of the other dog having a seizure, it probably freaks him out when he sees the other dog move strangely during the seizure. So hes probably just reacting, because he is unsure of whats going on with the other dog. If your pit bull is fine, all around, with the other dog, beside the seizures, then i don't think this is an aggressive dominant situation. I think like i said, your pit bull is reacting to something he doesn't understand. But if this is a case where the pit bull is developing this fixation on attacking the other dog, maybe it would be appropriate to re home the pit bull, and find another buddy, more compatible with the other dog.|`|AztYCjc7aa	Pits are great dogs, I own a beautiful female Pitbull/Chow Chow mix and contrary to popular belief gentle with the right owner, however most pits can be dog agressive. however if he is only attacking during your dogs seizures it suggests that you need to become a better pack leader and NOT allow it. I would consult a behaviorist before I tried anything else. Remember your dog may not take kindly to being shown what is not acceptable behavior and may not give up dominance or bad behaviors easily this is why I would call a professional to evalute the dog.|`|LdBt4ZWvaa	he may think that your other dog's seizures are hurting you or he doesnt understand what is happening to him, so he is trying to protect you. he may find the other dog a threat to you. you have to remember that pit bulls are guard dogs. If you tell him its ok when the other dog has seizures, he may losen up a bit. Good Luck!
ZSWmOkE6aa	just keep on misting and make sure that there is something in the cage for him to rub up against. also, it should take about a week or two to get through the shedding process.|`|xggSASTwaa	well the shed could take awhile but i dont think you really need to worry about anything while they shed, they do it all the time and its an instinct. Heat rocks are great for snakes in tanks! my old BOA loved his heat rock and i never had a prob with his shedding. He did it like 2 a month.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Humidity is good at 60-75% during shed. When your snake's eyes clear up, it will cast away it's old skin within 48 hours. Have an object like a piece of reptile wood in your snake's cage so he can rub up against it effectively. Mist with warm water.|`|r8ETcmHMaa	Keep the humidity in the 70's. You could be a tshirt or damp paper towels over the top of the cage to keep the humidity in so you don't have to consistently be misting. Also once you see the snake eyes go clear again you could gave it a bath with luke warm water for 15 mins. I don't do this but it does help if your snake has trouble shedding. Good luck.
VmZKZjP1aa	Are you talking about the movie? If so, which horse? The one Gilbert rides looks like a Thoroughbred.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	I don't remember any horses in that book...
i3JLRH3Gaa	No I don't thinks that's normal you could try asking him why. But maby he was playing a game i that case it is totaly fine!|`|PSyVB2UDaa	My hamster normally changes her sleeping spot every i want to say 2 days. it's really normal. ok?|`|6W4ZWOetaa	I'm sure he's just fine.  Ratties don't always like to sleep together.  :)  Have fun with your ratties!|`|VxhknQjEaa	Maybe, they just wanted to sleep somewhere else.|`|kGwMj5kcaa	Maybe they didn't want to sleep with each other. Maybe they wanted there space. But I wouldn't worry about it. My guineas do that all the time and they are fine!
vwC7klVVaa	To add to pomi momi list there is Buffy and emmy both bouvier des flandres , Lucy pit bull, Tony chihuahua, Beauty german shepherd, Lucca blacklab/pyrenees x, Rakim pit bull, Sabrina pit bull.|`|IGXE3aDraa	I could try but I think a lot of them are mixes|`|b60b6e8062f11f6cf697468a2c93558aaa	Well just from watching some of his episodes and the ones he has used on the show;    Daddy - Pitbull  Popeye - Pitbull  Minnie - Chihuahua mix  Curly - Greyhound/lab mix  Rupert - Schipperke  Zoey - Cockapoo  Melissa - Mix  Susie - Pitbull/Pointer  Apollo - Rottweiler  Pepito - Pitbull  Sheeba - Schipperke mix  Junior - Pitbull  Rex - Yellow Lab  Dottie - Staffordshire Terrier  Sid - French Bulldog  Minnie - Chihuahua mix  Coco - Chihuahua  Chinese Crested - Louis    Don't know what the rest of them are, sorry...|`|CzeKDSpwaa	No....I can't    BUT    I absolutely adore Daddy!

I love Cesar...I am in love hmmm    P.s  Can YOU name the breed of every dog in his pack?  :o)|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I never watch it. He has like 30 dogs doesn't he.|`|KFu7596Paa	he has loads   pitbulls and too many i cant name     ol hes got a chinese crested     he as alot of cross breeds     but my faveroute is daddy beauyfull pit|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Nope. Can't stand watching that programme.|`|JOz2Zl26aa	i think i could name alot of the dogs in the pack some i couldn't cause there mixed|`|7b4cd4909e3fddb3fc14d5677ec83183aa	hi, he has so many, and many o fthem look like they are a cross breed, but someone here seems to no. I must say i have chihuahuas and never seen them in his pack, i must be watching the wrong shows.  Good for him for helping all those dogs.  Lets face it some are very badly behavioured and yes if he didnt help them, i dont think they would still be alive.   I have a lot of respect for people who help those in need, great show, great man.  Must take him ages to feed and walk them, i have 9 chis and 3 poms and that takes me a while lol.
P1LkXSBLaa	its alright. she will be okay she will  just smell like a baby which is cute since she is your baby =)    but next time dont put anthing on her,   when she is completley dry she will smell   like the soap you put on her.|`|TZDQI6v4aa	May be she is not dry right!  Some breeds have an undercoat ans a top coat so it can be hard to tell if the dog is completely dry!  Other breeds just have a single coat which makes it easier to confirm when dry......Putting baby powder on a dog is not good as it can breath the powder & cause health issues  I would take the dog to a grooming parlor & then you will be sure all is well|`|6cD9Ig2oaa	Yes that's fine. Baby powder isn't going to her her. Just make sure those areas are completely dry, otherwise you'll have a clumpy mess...eeek|`|GfG4PfjMaa	Most dogs smell like dogs when they get wet....especially, when they get wet.  They smell like what they are....Dogs.    Do not put powder on the dog, it may clog their pores, get into their eyes when they scratch themselves, instead op for buying a better dog shampoo and a good conditioner this ought to reduce the smell quite a bit.|`|L2Gi2tPmaa	No you don't need to add baby powder.  When she is completely dry, that smell will go away.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	NO don't do that.  When she dries, she will smell better but she will always smell like a dog since she is one. You can doggie cologne & use that.(no ppl perfume)|`|3zv2bbolaa	If she is damp, it will clump up and will need to be brushed out later, but other than that, it is fine.     Lots of show breeders use corn starch and chalk on dogs to clean their white areas. They brush and blow it it out thoroughly afterwards so it doesn't break the coat and dry the skin.|`|RPTwjyjIaa	No the baby powder will clump when it contacts your puppies damp fur. If you want the smell to go away quicker you can try blow drying but start slow, and on low so you do not scare her. My dog is so good now I can blow dry him on high. You can also buy good doggy shampoo that smells good and is good for them for next time. Good Luck.|`|xggSASTwaa	yea its ok, some dogs have allergies but thats the same as humans and allergies. If you use dawn it helps with the smell, i like to use herbal essence to help with the smell. also there is a spray you can get that will help as well.|`|BVwDoV81aa	NO never put B_A_B_Y powder on a dog...ever..     The clue is on the bottle !|`|AA12322387	Don't put anything that isn't made for a dog on a dog.

Dogs bark at the door because they know when they hear that sound, someone new is coming into the house.  They do it out of excitement.    Ellen Farrah - You are so right!  I had a chihuahua once.  He was vicious and my pit wasn't!|`|6qAq5LrUaa	my pits always do so does my moms lab i think the more protective/loyal dogs do it the most|`|br1Ixdxkaa	i have a poodle mix and she didn't bark at all until she was 6 months.  Now, she barks when she hears a door close, birds chirping, and the doorbell, it's annoying now, but at first i wanted her to bark.  Enjoy it while it lasts.    get a bigger dog|`|BzU2SRvsaa	I have a boxer and he is an excellent guard dog. He went to obedience classes so he would know when to lay off though.|`|7rx3sdehaa	As stated prior, dogs that are known for being guard dogs are fantastic for what you are looking for. Although, if you simply want a dog to bark by noise and not entirely be a guard dog - then there are many choices for you. For instance, the infamous barkers themselves - the Pomeranian, are lovely for just yelping and barking for sometimes no valid reason. Also, even dogs such as the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog (the breed I work with) will bark like crazy whenever they see a person (this includes any noises).     Simply do research, that is the best way to find a breed that suits your lifestyle and your needs! Good luck!|`|hxBwRt09aa	I've not known a breed or mix that does not bark at the door, though an occasional individual dog may not. Is your shih tzu young? Puppies don't begin to bark until they reach that stage in their maturity. Sometimes very calm dogs will not bark.|`|oGVWdnHraa	Wow a Shih Tzu that doesnt bark, thats a new one lol......|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Some dogs have to be trained to bark. Mine automatically go into a sit about 3 feet from the door. I have this little trick, I use hand signals, If its a stranger I give the signal to bark. That gets rid of that problem
aCqSF87Raa	I would also post it in the photo section  -  even if they aren't interested in dogs, any photographer would be able to pick out emotions from a photo and nitpick things (light, composition, etc.) It IS their field of expertise!    Anyways; personally i think the photo is very cute!     From a photographers standpoint; The brown nose and eyes drawn the eye (my eye, your eye, etc) to the dog - if the nose/eyes were, say, blue or lighter colored they wouldn't really be a focal point and your eyes would just wander and not focus on anything (since the colors are all similarly light.)    The head tilt shows inquisitiveness. The snow covering the dog suggests the dog was playing or having some fun. The background is out of focus but the dog is perfectly in focus and clear, so you focus on the dog. The head is pretty much dead center.    Very nicely done! I love to use my own dog as a model, but she won't stay still enough.|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	cant really figure it out, but i like ur dog very nice, n u r right bout getting more response in here lol|`|mfXDUkRYaa	He's very sweet!    His eyes are mesmerising.|`|KxjUim7yaa	The dog has a hurt and puzzled look in it's face like someone he loves threw a snowball in his face.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	he looks like an angel  lol    my dog Bella looks like that when we play in the snow|`|6VFh61jhaa	I see a dog that looks kindo of bewildered and confused. Maybe someone is laughing at it becaus eof the snow, and hes wondering why. He has a bright look in his eyes and is really cute.    So what is the story behind the picture?|`|I2WkoJgPaa	A fuzzy raccoon (sp?)|`|1Enh1OKLaa	well this may not be the right answer BUT my dog looks at me like that when he's playing in the snow.  All i see in those eyes is unconditional love and thanks for being my human no matter how silly you look with that camera. there are dogs out there that have to live in the bad weather but this little guy looks happy to just be with his/her human. THATS what i see.|`|RyU2o8Tqaa	a curious mind at work|`|PM23RDycaa	"Put the camera down and GET ME OUTTA HERE!" First thing that came to mind.    *rolls eyes at blunt*    ADD: The pic reminded me of the fact I had to dig bruno - neighbor's mastiff out of the snow bank in our back yard the other day and had the same look on his face pretty much.    Curiosity comes to mind as well, kid of like when wild animals usually juveniles find the rock cameras and realize something isn't quite normal about said rock.|`|oGVWdnHraa	Blunt Object, that dog isnt a mutt, it is a border collie    In that picture I see curiosty, wonder, beauty, playfull-ness (couldnt think of a better word lol)    The thing that sticks out the most for me is the line of snow down the middle of the dogs face and the way it continues the markings around the dogs muzzle :)|`|vPde97E2aa	Snowy mutt. So?|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	Seems like he's saying, "Ok, you took the picture. Can we go play fetch now?"     *copies Raven and rolls eyes at blunt* :P|`|BVwDoV81aa	I see stars, gweat big stars all around me, flashing lights, everythings gone white, where am I     ?|`|xYsCC5UXaa	What sticks out most: the eyes.  Not only are they gorgeous, but they look like they have so much thought and curiosity behind them.  What comes to mind with the entire picture is:;  "Mommy, I made a cocoon, can we play fetch now?"  The eyes really appeal to me, though.  I can see adoration, curiosity, and playfulness there; but so much more seems to be beneath that.    He's a gorgeous dog.  Reminds me of my SW. =]  Cheers for that.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	He looks as though in the middle of playing he stopped because he was curious about what you were doing? Are you asking us to do your homework?

cCNj40fEaa	I would change her food, try giving her good fresh boiled chicken and rice instead of commercial food, she might have a 'sensitive' stomach    also you should try to get not so commercial food, the stuff they sell at the supermarkets is not good!!! it might be cheaper but in the long run, if you feed her cheap food from the store, you'll have to pay a lot of vet bills... change to more natural food, even if more expensive, it will keep your puppy healthy!    here some sites that might help you finding good food for her, in meantime you should feed her just what you'd eat for a stomach ache, cooked chicken, some oatmeal and maybe even rice porridge    http://www.naturapet.com/search/?animal=...  http://www.wellnesspetfood.com/dog_index...       the most important part is to NOT let her dehydrate!! it's good that she's drinking water, but if she stops drinking water you can force her to drink water with a dropper or a syringe (without the needle of course!!)     here a website with advice on healthy dog feeding!    http://www.ehow.com/how_2028899_treat-do...    also, if she keeps on being sick, don't hesitate on taking her to the Vet, even if expensive, it can be a harder thing that she has and not just an upset stomach!!    Good luck and hope your puppy recovers soon!|`|b4NcFBhraa	It could be the food brand, some dog food gives diarhea or other problems in the digestive. I'd tell us what brand of food you're using.

ADD:  well,if she was fine on the food befroe, you can try to change the food, or take her to a vet for a check-up.(I vote for the vet appointment).        .|`|QDFj9JPfaa	...here's the advise...   take the dog to the VET !!!!!!!|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	need more info- what r u feeding her, soft, hard kibble, table food, grain like bread n stuff like that isnt good for them|`|JOz2Zl26aa	better safe then sorry take her to the vet with puppy's u never know  they could be fine one second and almost dying the next|`|w1HbcbZuaa	well my chiwawa had the same thing and shes a puppy we just waited a couple a days and it passed just feed her can food it might just pass give ur dog a couple a days|`|HtHFHfDKaa	I had a neighbor with two sick puppies once and they both had diarrhea they told me it was just a cold bug and for it to take it's course. The puppies were sick for 2 weeks|`|lB732Tiyaa	How long ago was it that you had the dog de-wormed? If it was recent that's probably what was causing it. If not, I would take her in because she is still young and susceptible to viruses.|`|WVAKlcZNaa	call your vet and ask them what to do and follow their directions carefully!|`|oZsABHovaa	its definitly the food are u giving it adult food? cause its a puppy and it needs puppy food lol|`|WLvGFqAwaa	Call the vet's office with your question, they will usualy help over the phone without charging anything.|`|4vfDveiZaa	It might be that she is reacting to her puppy food, some puppies tummies are more sensitive than others. The diarrhea may pass if you just hang in there, but if you notice a worsening of symptoms or weight loss definitely take her in. Good luck, hope she feels better!|`|SzwG7scCaa	Are there worms in it?  Puppies get worms if they arent treated. If so, get a wormer from your local pet supply.  How long has it been going on?  Diareah happens, and is not usually serious unless it continues and the dog gets dehydrated.  Did she eat something she shouldnt have?  Have you changed her food recently?  Is she stressed or upset?  As long as she is eating and drinking normally, give it a day and see if she regulates.|`|hIxQTwK3aa	i really think your puppy should go to the vet but don't worry your puppy would be ok|`|br0BbJfcaa	Just call the vet, if they are a good vet then at least talk to you for 5 mins over phone and give you some advice on what to do. If you're vet is closed look up a emergency vet to talk to at night time.|`|bIFkehwzaa	you should take her to the vet for a check up. it is always recomened that when you get a new dog that they are checked out by a vet. you can try to slowly change the food to a better qyality food|`|cPTB57WMaa	I think so|`|hneetSf2aa	Its the type of food or it could be worms...i think ya need to take your puppy to the vet..or give the puppy to someone who will take care of it|`|QVP8zSuWaa	She needs to go to the vet.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Any time a puppy has diarrhea, you need to consult a vet. Especially a small dog like a Chi. If you don't want to bring her in, at least call - they shouldn't charge for a call and MOST vets will give you suggestions to try at home (unless they believe it is an emergency.)    My dog went through the same thing and it turned out to be her food - first it was too rich, then she didn't like the kibbles (too big) and i thought the brand was crappy, then we finally found one she liked and was good for her.     But she was shooting like crazy for a while and the vet had us switch food immediately (only do this at advice of a vet, food changes in general should be gradual) and add rice and chicken/beef (all plain and boiled) to her diet for a while. We also had to give Kaopectate (dosage is different for each dog, so call to ask before giving.)    Eventually it cleared up.|`|uEczwc5vaa	My dog has gotten diarrhea a couple times before.  There really is no medicine for that puppy that's cheap, so just let him/her let it all out.  He/her should just let it all out until his body gets clean on the inside.  It will stop eventually   Hope your puppy feels better!  In the future, make sure you know what it is eating, so you can help :)
IzRk1mZQaa	The four front teeth of rodents are constantly growing, which is why they have the need to chew so much.  If there are more teeth involved, are her gums red or swollen?  Is the animal still eating without incident?  Obviously you need to get more to chew on other than the cage!! Whereever you buy food there is going to be all kinds of chew treats for her that won't break her teeth, just wear them down.|`|03mcfpADaa	Hi  Ive never had any problems concerning hamsters and there teeth, my hamsters were ok, if you find she is having problems eating and chewing things, just to be sure there is nothing drastically wrong I would check with your vet, hamsters normally file there teeth down on chews and gnawing blocks and cages often.  don't worry to much about her chewing the cage you wont get her to do anything different, my hamsters used to do it all the time and never had any problems.  the vet is the only option if her teeth are damaged.    hope this helps.|`|wFPnYWZiaa	they do chew down their teeth often but if it is a drstic break i would bring her in to a vet it could effect how she eats|`|6kEeonfoaa	Okay go to a vet to see what they think. A broken tooth makes it hard for it to eat. The vet will tell you what you should do.
va8xvhthaa	Oh, what a cute hamster!  I have a robo hamster myself!!! It's a female, and I haven't chosen a name for her yet.

wFPnYWZiaa	go to care.com you can post and people resond that live in your area|`|6cD9Ig2oaa	check your local veterinarians. I know that mine has a board and I've seen fliers fro just what you're asking for! If not, one of the vet techs may be willing to do so.....I would start there and then maybe just search the internet, hopefully you find what you need! Good Luck!|`|xggSASTwaa	where are you located?
JOz2Zl26aa	no cause im guessing ur still hurting over the other dogs death and the new dog will pick up on that and he'll see it as a sign of weakness and that could start alot of unwanted behavior so in my opinion wait a couple of months|`|PM23RDycaa	I would give it some more time before putting the effort into looking for a new dog to join the family.|`|gzxvPse7aa	Sorry about your dog. I've been through the same type of scenario and I know how hard it must be for you right now. When mine died I was asking the same question, but when I finally decided to get a new one, the joys of having it greatly outweighed the pains of the death and of what could come in the future. I say go for it, maybe find a breed that isn't as subject to health problems as others so that you can be more sure about the dog's future. Good Luck!|`|DBIgAIBZaa	Not yet. Give it some good time first.|`|5PsKGss7aa	Think about it some more, really its up to you if you feel as though you are ready for another.  Sorry for your loss.|`|fmHHcFd5aa	depends. if your not ready give yourself time to heal. its hard and if you get one before your ready it wont be the same and it wont work out. wait till you are completely over it then move on. my mom just lost her puppy and hasnt replaced him. that was almost a year ago. Shes still not ready. of course she has her other puppy but its not the same.|`|iGlmAHVZaa	You will always suffer a little bit when you get a dog. Because they will never live for ever. But I would get another.|`|ff9kxHHqaa	yes.get a puppy if you start with a puppy he will be easier to train.|`|TlHwwnmBaa	You should probably wait a few months before you get another one. Make sure the new dog is a little different to the first one. A diff colour or breed. Or you will be constantly thinking of the first dog who died.|`|TZDQI6v4aa	Some people need the companionship of a dog straight away.  Its not a bad thing Nothing can replace your dog but there could be a pup out there just waiting to help you fill the gap in your life No matter what we do we cannot keep our 4 leg companions forever although we all wish we could You go for it if you feel it is right for you|`|WqmnQNp6aa	Mark, the reason you are experiencing such heartache is because you have been fortunate enough to have received the unconditional love and loyal companionship of a pet.  Your dog loved you without judging you and was always glad to see you when you can home.  I am so sorry for your loss.    As for getting a new pet:  Do you have the time right now needed for house training, etc?    Can you make the commitment to provide for the needs of a new animal for the next 10 plus years? (not about to head off for college, etc)    If the circumstances are all positive for welcoming a new dog, go ahead.  The only thing I ask is that you look into adopting a dog from a shelter or from a breed-specific rescue society.  The next great love of your life might be there, just waiting to melt your heart with his warm, brown eyes.|`|HigxGZbYaa	Not right away. Give yourself time to mourn.    After a few months, if you feel like getting another dog, go ahead. But only when you're ready.    It may be a good idea to choose a dog that doesn't look like your previous one. In any case, remember that you're not trying to find an identical replacement for your previous dog, and you shouldn't expect the new one to act the same or be the same as the one you said goodbye to. Appreciate the new dog for its own personality.    Loss of a pet is very painful. I still cry sometimes about dogs that I've had to put down years ago. Pets come into our lives for a while, and then they're gone. It's never easy to say goodbye.    But pets provide so much love and companionship that it's inevitable that we'll want to bring another pet into our lives at some point! Just take it slow.|`|PuGYgTDJaa	i would too but i wouldn't get one so soon i would wait a year or so but that is just my opinion i mean i would need a lot of time to get over when my dog dies that is what happened with my dog buddy we had to put him to sleep because of cancer but that was 2 years ago and the hurt is still there but the pain doesn't hurt as bad but now i had just gotten another dog about a week ago and is still a pup it's a golden retriever and it's name is Dee Dee but anyway i was just trying to prove a point and i would let the hurt ease a little first|`|ahjOfnIIaa	Hey Mark, just from personal experience......you are not in the right emotional frame of mind to get another one just yet, you JUST lost your best friend and I think are just wanting something to fill that hole. Not to replace him, but to fill that void that you feel from his absence. It's kinda like being on the rebound from a breakup. Over time once you realize that the new puppy is not your old one, you may come to resent the dog or yourself because you miss your old dog so much. It would probably be best if you give yourself time to grieve his loss first, then when and if you are ready, go for it..there are so many beautiful little dogs out there in need of some TLC. And in time, if that's what you decide to do, you will be ready to accept the new one into your life fully...and you will be happier....hope this helps :) Good luck and take care of yourself, it's not easy, but you will heal and learn in time that unfortunatly it is a difficult part of life, but you will come to appreciate the time you have with them more because of it. Here's a tip: Don't think of it as he's dead and gone forever, think of it as he was a blessing in your life that added a special something, and you WILL miss him, but maybe someday another little dog will be there to add something just as special......All good things...Take care Mark =)|`|rku9gmgVaa	if your ready to move on and accept that your dog is in a better place then go  for it!|`|ekpzJn2Jaa	Wait 2 months.

His name has ranged from Mr. Binx, to Honey Bunny, to Foo Foo B, to Little B, so and and for forth.  There are probably 20 different names.

K5IOSGXAaa	He is either biting you because he is afraid of something you are doing or he is going into "overload" by playing too vigorously. You can tell when your parrot is going to bite by checking out the pupils in their eyes, when they get really small they are going to bite, it means they are excited about something and is a good sign to watch out for. Meanwhile, be gentle around your amazon, move slowly, spend time and talk to him. If he bites you while you are handling him or lashes out at you, make him "step up" onto your hand. You have to show him you aren't going to hurt him but at the same time that you are in control. It takes time and patience. Plus, you are always going to get bit at times, it is just the price we pay for having parrots. Learn to watch his eyes and you will have a head's up.
px27V5N9aa	Don't know, don't have a pic to look at confo.   What are your plans with the colt?  He might reach 16 hands.    Is he solid or paint?    If you plan on using him in show, yeah, $800 would work.  If you are just using for trail and to have as a bud...nope.  for $800 you can get a grown horse broke and ready to go.    EDIT:  Hard to tell by the pics but...if you can find out her registered name, the Dam it would help.  You can compare that other colt to the one you want to buy.  I LOVE the legs on Peppered Diamond.  That one is going to be nice in dressage or in jumping.  I don't like Peppered Prince.  He looks coon footed and tiny hooves.    Two Times Peppered Storm is just...blah! ick    So..find out the dams name and you can get an idea by the other three.  I just can't tell by that small pic.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	... anyone can ride him?  WHY are they riding a foal?  That is a sure-fire way to give the poor thing arthritis before it turns ten.  I hope I misunderstood what the seller said...    The stallion and mare both have no record, neither is proven and career-broodmares are basically horses that are too crazy to ride.  Why would you want a baby from a mare they can't even ride?  They own both parents which also usually means they just had two horses lying around and bred them just because they can, not because the two would produce a good foal.    If he allows his feet to be handled and leads well that would be a good start on his training though.      I think no, in this economy you can find much better for this price.    Also, unless you are an experienced trainer don't get a baby they are very difficult to train.  Might as well get a 3-year-old so you can start working with it right away, or better yet get an older horse that's already broke.  For $800 you can probably find one in this economy.|`|IhjFjoKDaa	I'm sure he's a gorgeous little guy - if I were you though I'd think twice about the $800 price tag. This year is going to be even worse than last year in the horse market. I'm sure he's nice but as a paint cross he's not worth the $800.     I picked up a full sound, already saddled Off the Track TB for $150 last week. She's athletic, papered, already used to being groomed/ bathed/ clipped/ trailered and I'm just re-training her for eventing. She's obviously already got the forward movement figured out so we're learning right now how to get on the bit and starting jumps.    I wouldn't pay 800 for an untrained horse in this market.|`|XL62syrCaa	Dont get a foal for your first time training on your own. Get a 2 year old that has the basics down.  Train a few "older" horses before you get a baby.     His bloodlines DEF aren't worth $800. Nothing special. I just sold a 2008 colt (Un-gelded, with registration with good bloodlines) for $250. You can find a good 2 or 3 year old STARTED for that much (I also sold a 3 year old BS paint mare with 120 days of training on her for $500.)    His offspring aren't that great. So either they are breeding to so so mares or hes not that great of a stallion.     usually you can tell the height of the baby by his parents. He won't outgrow them by THAT much (He might reach 16hh) You don't breed two 15hh horses together and come out with a 17hh horse (2 +2 doesnt equal 5)    That and the seller tends to be going off on how perfect he is. I am always leary of that. Has he ever had a vet check done period? Vaccinations? Is there anything he does have a problem with (most horses have at least ONE problem especially at that age.     It would be a pass for me|`|wSc7ZdBCaa	You have received some really great advice so far.  Pictures are not a guarantee of anything "solid". You need to do the necessary homework. Someone with knowledge and experience needs to "look" your choice(s) over. What "schooling" have you had at training for dressage and jumping? Are you qualified to train and ready to put in the long hard hours of work required to train a "weanling colt"?  There are some serious questions that need to be addressed (as others have stated). Word of mouth is not anything you can "take to the bank"!  Documentation, validation and recommendations from the experts is what you want before investing in any horse flesh. The price/cost would be dependent on the foregoing and the market value in your location.   Wishing you the important wisdom to do your research, be honest with yourself about what you can and want to handle, and the successful decision in order for you to have a happy relationship with the right horse.|`|KyHiCSKeaa	I don't show...but...for $800 and that background (and his looks) he sounds like a great deal.|`|mKWwz1uUaa	It would depend on a vet exam, pics are needed to make sure he's got good conformation, it's hard to say, but for me in (my area) it's high, and without pics to  at least look over there really is no way to know.  No vaccinations history, farrier care?, wormings?, what type of feed is he on, he's a year old and she's not sure he's dropped? Hum have a few questions as you can tell, can you post pics?  Need more info to help correctly.  His temperment sounds fair, for a baby:)|`|VmZKZjP1aa	Depends on his conformation, vet check and what you are planning on using him for.   Overall, I would say he sounds good, but if you can I'd at least get a vet check.     Good luck|`|Nuh3T1cDaa	The stallion seems ok.  I don't get too fussed over people saying how nice their stallion is because almost all stallions with proper training and handling will be very nice and gentle and laid back.   If the yearling in the picture is the one you're looking at then he's not bad.   But... IMHO I think you should pass for two reasons.  1st he's over priced and should have been gelded last fall.  2nd new trainers often mess up their first colt that they train.  You'd be better off taking a free 2 or 3 or 4 year old and working with them.  Then sell or give away the horse when you think you've taught them all you can and get another one.  The only way to become a trainer is to train LOTS of horses.  But, if you're in love with this one there doesn't seem to be a reason not to buy except that you can find one just as nice but cheaper and cheaper isn't everything.|`|pS8A05NTaa	OMG gorgeous. go for it!!!!!!!!|`|MtmpOqZ7aa	Well it sounds like you have recieved lots of good advice so far. I am not too concerned about him not being gelded yet. My colt is almost 9 months old and I am still waiting on him to completetly drop so that he can be gelded.    "He has never needed a vet." Well, what does that mean? All horses need a vet even if it is just for his vaccines which he really should have recieved.     Foals often are alot like their dams.  We have a broodmare at our barn that is a flighty TB.  She thows beautiful paint foals (always had fillys except for the past two), but both of the colts are more spooky than my weanling.  This could also be due to the fact that the owner never really did much work with them.    It is doubtful that he will outgrow his parents.  Typically a horse will fall between sire and dam in height.  Gelding early as opposed to waiting *may* get you a tad bit more in height.     I would like to know more about what he can do.  Just because he is young doesnt mean he shouldnt know a lot of the basics.  My colt was cross-tied before he was weaned.    Of course he would need to be vetted to rule out any problems.  Personally I would not spend $800 on him.  Neither the sire or the dam has a proven show record or fantastic bloodlines to warrent the price which makes me think his price tag is due to his color.    Others have already said you can get another horse that is comparable or even better than this colt for much cheaper.  When it comes down to it, it's your money so none of us can really tell you what to do.    Also, you say this is your first time training a horse which is fine, my colt is my first as well. How long have you been working with horses? Do you have the skill and experience to do a baby justice? Do you have someone with more experience that you can turn to when you need help?
Um8osMNuaa	They tend to feather pluck due to boredom, if you need to leave him alone then try leaving the TV on or playing music, my Bob loves to watch TV.  When they are preening and can't get their feathers to lay flat it can stress them and cause them to pluck them out, you should spray him a couple of times a week with warm water in a misting bottle, this helps with preening, only do it when it's warm so that he doesn't get a chill.  Seed isn't a good food for a parrot, pellet feed provides the nutrients and vitamins that they need, a small amount of seed is fine but it shouldn't be their main source of food.  l feed pellet feed, a little seed, and fresh fruit and veg daily, he also likes monkey nuts as a treat. He also eats whatever l eat, he loves pizza, any of our food is fine, as long as it doesn't contain salt or sugar, variety is good for them.  Once they start feather plucking it can turn into an habit, you need to try and stop it before it does develop into a bad habit.|`|IxuMTGd4aa	Hi    NO! This is not normal in the least, unless the bird is molting! Her are a few ways to get him to stop plucking TOOKEN FROM MY WEBSITE:    Feather plucking is a very common problem with birds, I think it is too common. Birds would pluck their feathers for multiple of reasons, such as stress, depression, and the most common reason, not enough stimulation.     You can stop this by spending more time with your AG and giving it more toys to stop him/her from being too bored and not having enough stimulation. You can also get another bird, but I do not advise this because the older bird will spend more time and attention to the new bird.    YourAG may be stressed because you left or something is bothering it. Is everything turned off at night like computers, television, or radios? Your AG could have been stressed because it didn't have enough sleep. They may have been stressed because something happened or something frightened it, or you got it a new toy or brand of bird food and/or treats, or other things.     I would switch EVERYTHING back to what it was when they didn't pluck their feathers, and this may stop its extremely bad habit.    Depression is very common with birds, too. There are multiple ways to stop this. One is to get a new bird or toys, get medication from your Avian vet/specialist which I do NOT recommend because this could easily kill your birds, or another safer and easier way is to spend a lot more time with your bird.    --------------------------------------...     If you do decide to get medication for your bird, these are the best ways that I have found to give it to them:    * Feed it to the bird with a syringe. I have found this works best with younger AGs, and with older birds it is harder to do. But do NOT force feed it! This can choke your AG, or get the medication in its nostrils or eyes, which probably isn't the best thing.    * Put the medication (in powder or liquid form) in the African Grey's water. The bird will drink it, no harm done. Just make sure the bird doesn't bathe in it or else it can cause damage to the feathers.    * Put it in the bird's food. This could be in powder, seed, treat, or any form that won't make the food nasty. This, from my point of view, is perfectly safe.|`|Ayn7tpXKaa	A really good resource would be to join the Grey Forums community, many seasoned African Grey owners that can help you out a lot more than on here.    http://www.greyforums.net    I'd agree with someone else who mentioned boredom.  I have a 2 yr. old C.A.G and he isn't kept inside his cage all day, not locked in.  He has a ladder that he can wander around for walks, a play top on his cage, a ton of toys.    Check out the toy situation.  Does he have enough?  Too many?  Either one isn't good.  If you can't afford more toys, move the ones he already has around.    Sounds like you're feeding him well, but here's a link to a really extensive list.    http://www.greyforums.net/forums/bird-fo...
c10vvTbGaa	Don't listen to that Matt guy. He doesn't know what he's talking about; there's not just a saddle difference. Let's get this straight:    ENGLISH: Lighter saddle, no horn, iron stirrups, uses a girth instead of a cinch to attach saddle, does jumping, post trotting, much more complicated bridle. If I may, English is somewhat more 'prissy' than Western. I love it anyway though. You do have more control. Another thing is the pants; you can wear jodhpurs or jeans. And the boots. You have to get paddock boots and I also have half-chaps that go up to my knees. These aren't needed, but they help once you've gotten to a certain level of riding.    WESTERN: Heavier saddle, has a horn, leather stirrups, uses a cinch instead of a girth to attach saddle, does more trail riding, cow work, rodeo-type stuff. The bridle is extremely simple. It is much more relaxed than English, but I feel as if I have less control. I have tried both and have stayed with English. You also only wear jeans with Western; and the boots are just the cowboy boots you see at Cavender's and Drysdales.    Hope it helps! I've done all this too!|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	The two main differences is the equipment you need and how you ride your horse.  The gaits are different speeds, and some have different names:  Jog/Trot, Canter/Lope, Extended canter/gallop.  You have western riding styles working cattle, speed events (gymkhana), reining.  English style riding would include dressage, hunter-jumper, fox hunting, polo.  In both styles you can jump, trail riding. (To name a few of each). Equipment-wise, your tack is all different: saddle, bridle, etc.    You can still wear your jodphurs in a Billy Cook, and you can wear your levis in a Stubben.|`|Xa0ndGNjaa	The type of saddle used is the main defference. A western saddle has a horn on the front of it.    Western riding is more suited for long trail rides while English riding is more suited for agility. It really depends on what your planning on doing.|`|SzwG7scCaa	I think you mean "English" and "Western".. The simplest difference is that Its a different saddle and reigning techniquies.  Which you choose depends on what you want to do, and what sort of horse you are riding.  (Not to mention the horses training.)  You wont find a calf roper riding an english saddle, and you wont find anyone who would choose a western saddle for jumping crossrails.|`|njSyZh0Aaa	Personall I like both    English is more for jumping,racing,dressage and such and such    Western is more pleasure riding, riding with friends barrel racing,trail riding which I love to do.........    If you want to just have a horse that you can connect with not do fancy jumpiong just one you can gallop along pleasurably then definitely go western... If you wanna show jump or whatever go english|`|YOfRm3U5aa	English- jumping, dressage, cross country, eventing, hunters, trails.  Western- barrels, polls, ranch work, etc.    go to http://www.youngrider.com and subscribe to the magazine. It has English and western riding lessons!    Or order USPC (united states pony club) manual levels. They have english riding tidbits.|`|DPegPYRPaa	Saddles, Bridles, the way you carry yourself, They way you hold the reins.  Western is more kick back relax and have fun and you basically neck rein.   English is more uptight, dress right, hold the reins in both hands type thing. I prefer western.|`|wBhorI6paa	Did you mean english? If you did its mostly the moves,clothes and saddles. I would recommend western for begginers but english is more fun for me.|`|qjjmsNCxaa	One is done in the east and one is done in the west hope this helps.|`|rTSwouqXaa	The largest difference comes from their origins. English riding was for the Lords, Nobles and well to do people in Europe. Western riding developed from the work required on large cattle ranches in the Western United States.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	Of course they obvious difference is the tack and activities available. But what I think is the most different is the culture in each group. Take is from someone who bobs back and forth between both circles.|`|F0nRMmmlaa	Well lets try English and Western! Thats ok though :) I would recommend English :)|`|NwhrZt9Saa	different saddles, clothing, western is more laid back, and english is more structured. I am still learning to, but i am pretty sure there are more things to learn in english. I haven't started riding yet. But i am going to do english because the closest western riding barn is like an hour and a half away.
iOI2RT6maa	I used to have two of them, both males, and in the same cage.    At first they didn't get along that well, but after a while they were good company for each other, and 'talked' to each other.    In english!    No they didn't hold a conversation,  it was more like.    ;Hello'  'How are you'  'Fine, i'm fine/  'thank you.    That's the extent it was, but it was pretty cool to hear them =p
AA11082932	normal,,cats will loose their whiskers like you do with your eyelashes..When they grow too long they will fall out or the cat itself will pull them out.. Don't worry unless your cat has no whiskers..because they use them to judge the whether they can fit into a hole and also helps with balance..|`|f4531b5e137327c8a5e6a1daa06a71ffaa	Never heard of that with cats, just mice|`|c3621bfd2b0cecaf9b6d6e5a39d51af3aa	it's natural
XePzTCAGaa	Lunge him before you ride him just to see how hyper he will be. Have someone more experienced ride him first at a canter and then you ride him with someone on the more controlled pony next to you. He might see that the other horses is calm and controlled and might slow down and be calm.|`|04QDV97kaa	I would suggest lunging him one of your big pastures if you need to.   Don't get on him if you are scared and nervous. He would be able to tell and it may make him more jumpy than he would be otherwise.  Ask for someone to be there when you do ride him. It wouldn't be good to need help and not have any. I always say it's better to have the help and not need it. :)  Hope this helps!  Lucy|`|bqbrKFeUaa	I think you should have your trainer come out and take him for a spin just ot clear things up and make sure everything is good to go.|`|8cikAYp3aa	make the first canter of the spring uphill if you can.  Horses are more inclined to canter, not buck and to be reasonable uphill.  Also  I wouldnt wait till spring.  Get a friend, and take your new boy and your old steady boy out for a bit of a trail ride.  Walk. slow trots, and a few short canters.  He should behave better with a steady partner along|`|ZTCspx5saa	have a friend trainer or parent etc. ask them to lunge you. It helped me alout to get back recovering from my fall. If you have a good seat you are in awsome shape. good luck. hope i helped|`|iiNAJfGCaa	If you are this concerned, lounge him before you ride. Make him canter both directions. He's probably going to act a little silly but at least he'll get his running out of his system out on the lounge line. When you feel that he's behaving himself hop on and, only after he is being quiet at the walk and trot, ask for a canter on a circle. That way if he starts to speed up you can easily control him and bring him back down to a trot. If he behaves himself then you might not have to lounge him the next time -- the first canter after a long break is always the hardest.|`|rXI7CUXiaa	It sounds like this wil be your first spring with this horse. I would definitely hand walk him to an arena or a open area and lunge him daily for a few days. Then I would bit/saddle him up and lunge him for a week or so and then ride. Just let him get on the bit and carry himself before you go out. He has to get all the kinks out and loosen up (mind and body) before he will work and listen.|`|4KY26xQqaa	BITE THE BULLET GIRL!  I know however daunting a scary it may be you gotta do it. I find it help if you have someone there watching you or it would be real good if they could lunge you round with you on him.  I would wait till the ground softens down before you do this though!
pnDZcQKpaa	before you load him on the trailer, lunge him for a little bit. get his energy out, so he'll be safe to ride, even in a new place. make sure you have all your stuff, so that you won't have to go back and forth. when you get there, ride him for a while and jump him a little bit. ride like you usually do at home, and RELAX. that's the most important thing; if you're tense, he's tense. he an feel it through your hands, seat, and legs. when you're relaxed, he'll be too.  also, bath him the day before the show. if the show barn has a shower stall, ask if you could use it. once you're done, throw a cooler on him and wrap him front (and back, if you want) legs, so that he's not sore before the show day. it'll also help keep his legs clean.  you'll want to get to the barn on show day by 6:30 or 7. if you braid, get there earlier. lunge him in the morning again, but don't overdo it if you're doing lots of classes. then, if he's dirty, groom him, tack up, get yourself ready, last minute show sheen spray and its show time!  good luck :)|`|db9ce3362907a136acac0610fae4357eaa	Your first show can be an intimidating experience, just realize it will totally be a learning experience for you and your horse.  Don't expect too much and go with the whole intention of just having fun.  As for what to do when you go, make sure you get there early with plenty of time to work in the arena you will be showing in.  Most horses typically need to be worked more in new places to keep their attention and the extra work will help calm your nerves.  I do not ride my horse the day before the show but lunge him instead, as I can always get too intense and end up just fighting with him as nothing ever seems perfect enough for me.  Remember, just relax and have fun, you will be fine.  As for cleaning a mostly white horse, have no idea as I have never owned one.  Good luck.|`|Hexqwm58aa	from what you siad it doesnt sound like he spooks alot. so thats good.  but just to make sure, you need to desensitze him.    Clint Anderson has ALOT of teqneiqes to desensitize your horse. i would suggest looking at one of his books. he is western, but it applies to all styles of ridding. you can find his books at feed places, tack shops and pretty mcuh anywere you buy horse stuff.|`|XHHkBkwOaa	for a white horse or properly named light grey     stains on legs = chalk (use chalk rub it on his legs to make then look really white    you can also paint his hooves black to make them stand out (if he has nice feet)    also have you heard of nappi san??? this works well on their tails!!     make sure you don't leave it on his tail for too long or let it touch his   skin too much.    ALSO WORKING YOUR HORSE EG****LUNGING  IN THE AREA OR CLOSE TO THE AREA HE WILL BE WOKRED/SHOWN IN HE WILL NATURALLY GET USED TO THE NOISE AND SOUNDS AND GENERALLY BECOME MORE RELAXED     MAKE SURE YOU GIVE YOU AND YOUR HORSE PLENTY OF TIME TO RELAX AT THE SHOW AND LUNGE YOUR HORSE BEFORE YOU TACK HIM OR RIDE HIM  =)  (just incase he gets worked up to a sweat)|`|RloOJ43haa	Are there any other shows in your area before then? I think it's a good idea to take a newbie to a show without actually entering it the first time. He can have the experience of trailering off site, seeing strange horses and people, and lots of hubbub without the pressure of having to perform. You can just walk him or ride him around the show grounds and maybe in the warm up ring. It's almost  like a dress rehearsal for a show. So, if you can do this once or twice before your big show, he will have a much better chance of staying calm.|`|cQu2dqDkaa	I know how you feel, i was peeing my pants the day before my first show. what I would do is just take your horse to the show, don't do any class. Just walk him around, and ride him in the warm up arena or when you get a chance. You can see how your horse does with the new environment, and know what to expect next time. This is also really good because it gives tyou a chance to see what the classes are like and what to expect.|`|a1iykYO6aa	Don't worry! When i took my horse to my first gymkana i made sure to keep him happy. try to occupy him and yourself from getting to nervous. i don't show horses (sorry) but try to not be too stressed because as you know this will only freak him out. just stay calm :)      good luck ******

Your birds may like them, but no, it isn't good for them, at all! Here is the reason why:    Fruits are too sugary, and if you mix them with the veggies, they become sugary, too. Plus, the fruits are too acidic and all that acid leaks onto the vegetables, which is way to much acidic and sugary things in one serving.    No matter what your budgies like, go with what is more healthier for them, it is a lot better in the long run.|`|Q5B0RVoCaa	i don't know
gjD8pndjaa	"nice cute and friendly" are all subjective terms, two of which depend on training more than breed traits.    Many small dogs have pretty high energy levels.  Almost all terriers, papillons, poodles, corgis, spitz breeds.    Another thing I'd suggest, since many small dogs are prone to health concerns such as luxating patella (which would make exercise a bad idea) is to find a breeder that genetically tests their dogs for the condition.    Avoid dogs with pushed in faces (pekingese, pugs, boston terriers), since they have a tendency for breathing problems (not the best for heavy exercise)    If you're looking for a breed with a lot of energy, JRTs are right up your alley|`|xQtnTKCAaa	i have a standard poodle (she is pretty big) and she loves to snuggle up on my lap and go on long walks. if you dont want a big dog you could always get a miniature poodle?|`|LVDoQ1Kaaa	i agree boston terriers mine is 2 years old and it's not it's just mine its they dont shed much they love to lay by you and they follow you and are really obedient and cute. they are smart and have great personality's chiwawas are to barky and too small and lazy at times also the bostons live to about 16 years each a great   and they normally die of old age not heath problems but don't get a pug when there older they shed a ton and have a lot of heath problem and poodles have to be brushed too often i know this because all the targets had them as a logo and look cute|`|OFpl236faa	I would check out petfinder.com or your local shelter and get a dog around a year or two old.

rlvrgwWvaa	1.) Two rabbits aren't really that much more difficult to take care of, and a rabbit will get really lonely if they're alone. I suggest two, but you have to make sure the rabbits like each other before you put them in the same cage. Some shelters will let you and your rabbits visit the rabbits before you take them home. But when they're old enough, get them spayed/neutered. Your two rabbits will turn into 8!    2.) She may be depressed. Does she show any interest in life? Does she eat, drink, and clean herself? If she doesn't, she may be lonely. Play with her.    3.) Never too soon to start litterbox training. Put some litter in a regular plastic cat pan. The recycled cardboard kind should be good. You can get it at most pet stores. Also put some alfalfa hay in there. It will encourage her to poop in there, plus rabbits need a constant and unlimited supply of hay. When she gets to be older, switch to timothy hay. She should get the point soon.    4.) As said, put alfalfa hay in the litterbox. Plus, wood chips may not be the greatest idea. They're messy and make cleaning more difficult. Just get an old towel and spread it on her cage floor. If you want to get a small cardboard box and put even more hay in the corner, she'd like that.    5.) She can be picked up, but only if you know the safe way to do it. Put your right hand under her shoulders, and your left hand under her butt. Use your left hand to press her to your right arm. Pick her up. Then hold her to your stomach with her eyes covered. She'll feel really safe this way, and won't try to kick and injure her self. Just a note, rabbits should have at least a half hour of out of cage time a day.    6.) Best diet for a baby:Diet for Rabbits 6 Weeks to Adulthood    Always present:      ?  Fresh water       ?  Alfalfa hay (avoid mold - mold on hay causes sclerosis of the liver, leading to death)       ?  Alfalfa pellets    Daily:      ?  One papaya tablet once or twice a day.      ?  Vegetables in small amounts beginning at 8 weeks of age -           introduce these one at a time for three days before introducing another    Got that list from a very good rabbit website.    7.) Just keep her cage in the same place. It should be in an area where you spend time every day, but not too much time, like in the living room or a bedroom. There might be too much noise and they like to sleep.     8.) Nah, she may never. Just if her teeth are getting too long, then take her to a vet to get em trimmed. Plus if you want, put a small stuffed animal in there with her. But if she is chewing on it, take it out. Ingesting stuffing can kill her.|`|oGVWdnHraa	1. 2 bunnies is a great idea, if you are willing to desex both of them :) Same sex couples will often fight, and opposite sex couples breed like crazy, both of which are not healthy for buns. Also, female buns which do not get desexed have an 80% chance of contracting reproductive cancers by 5 years old! Males which arent desexed often spray and mount everything in sight.    2. She is probably still scared as she is in a new environment away from her family :)    3. Its never too soon to start litter training, but young rabbits are harder to train than older, when the rabbit gets to around 6 months old, it should be evident how well she will be litter trained :)    4. It doesnt really matter :)    5. No, its not to old to start handling her in that way, the sooner the better :)    6. Veggies should not be fed to rabbits until they are 6 months of age because at the age she is at now, he digestive system is not developed enough and feeding veggies can cause (fatal) stomach upsets.    7. Yes you should keep her in one spot until she is used to her surroundings :) Theres no point in putting unnecessary stress on her :)    8. Nah you shouldnt be worried unless it is a long term thing, but as long as she is eating her hay, she will be fine as the hay helps to keep the teeth down also :) (but always have wood chews available)     :)|`|xQtnTKCAaa	1. taking care of two is just as easy and its a great idea. it will keep your bunny from being lonely.     2. you said you had her for 3 days so shes probably just a little nervous.     3. litterbox is fine and its good to teach them at a young age    4. i dont think so but you can put it in a dish if your worried.    5. yes its good to teach them when they are young. also she should get used to be picked up.    6. not too young    7. let her get used to her surroundings, wait about a week or two.    8. some animals chew more than others so dont be worried.|`|AA11441276	1. i bought one ... how easy is it to take care of 2 and is 2 bunnies a good idea?    Bunny's are high matnenice. You should feed baby bunnies about twice a day. Give them timothy hay as a treat.   Two bunnies might be a good idea as long as they're the same sex. I'm sure you don't want multiple amounts of bunnies after awhile. :]    2. she sits in the corner of her cage for hours on end not moving ... why is this?  Resting...My bunny does it to. She's nocturnal. She sleeps during the day and runs around at night. Make sure the bunnies get enough exercise so they're tired at night and they actually sleep, or else they might keep you up.    3. i put a litter box where she poops the most, is it too soon?  nope! do it as soon as possible. Im not too fond of the litter box. Because if its not cleaned often enough, the bunny will be sitting in it's own pee and poop which will end up stinking up the bunny. And you can't give bunnies baths. :/ so if this happens just wipe the bunny down with a unscented baby wipe.    4. the timothy grass is not elevated off the wood chips ... should it be?  ?    5. is she too old to be taken out of her cage by hand, picked up, or to be put back? ( i do this to teach her how to exit and enter her cage)  No.    6. i started feeding her carrots and parsley along with her regular diet, is this too young?  don't feed her TOO many. start her out with a TAD bit. then you can slowly feed her a little bit more each week.    7. is it a bad idea to move her around in different locations? should i keep her in one spot of the house (i.e. my room) to let her get use to the surroundings?  Yeah, let her get use to her surroundings in the spot you're planning on keeping her.    8. she is not chewing on wood yet, should i be worried?  My bunnie's six weeks and she chews on it all the time. She might be. You just haven't noticed. If her teeth start getting too long take her to the vet.    Hope this is help to you!|`|cf6512509cb5d4c7f759c763983128acaa	Ok there is no need to worry so much about your new bunny.  Rabbits are fairly easy to take care of.  You just have to clean the cage once a week and feed and water it daily.  Now if you decide to get a second bunny.  You will need a second cage for a while.  You can't just put them together because they can fight with each other.  You want to slowly introduce them to each other and let them be together a little bit each day til you think they are ready to be together all the time.  I am sure two bunnies won't be too hard to take care of.  I know one rabbit isn't hard to take care of at all.  As for the rabbit sitting in the corner of the cage for hours on end it is normal.  Rabbits can sit there for long periods of time and just stare.  Our rabbit likes to stare at the wall as if it is fascinating.  I think they are just checking out their surroundings.   No I do not think it is too soon for a litter box.  Its a good idea to put one where she poops most if you want to train her.  I wouldn't worry about the timothy grass not being elevated off the wood chips.  That really is no big deal.  As long as it has something in its cage to poop and pee in that is safe for rabbits then you are fine.  Rabbits are never too old to be taken out of a cage.  In fact you should take your rabbit out of the cage at least once a day or however often you want to so that it may get some exercise.  Rabbits like to hop about and explore.  It is ok to feed your rabbits carrots and parsely.  Rabbits love carrots and I think its ok to feed it that when you want.  It won't hurt the rabbit at all.  Let the rabbit hop where it wants to,.  You do not have to keep it in one spot or room.  If you let it hop around it will eventually get use to its surroundings.  You will know this when it starts marking everything as its territory.  You do not need to be worried if she is not chewing on wood yet.  It will start chewing when it gets a little older and quite a bit.  It chews when its bored and to file its teeth down.  Chewing is something the rabbit will do when it wants to or needs to.  Good luck with your rabbit and I hope you enjoy her.  Rabbits are lots of fun.
IMPvzBk1aa	I've never heard of broken in at the poll, versus broken at the poll, which is the way I understand your question. There is controversy over classic breaking at the poll, with the poll being the highest point and the flexion occurring at the poll joint, versus the commonly seen (these days) flexion at the 3rd cervical vertebra, with the poll positioned lower than that vertebra.  I don't know if your question has something to do with that.  The head being on the vertical is associated with flexion at the poll and the horse working correctly on the bit.  When flexion occurs behind the poll, rather than at the poll,  it is considered to reflect backward energy and not represent the forward energy necessary to be correctly on the bit.  Maybe that's what you're referring to.....broken at the poll being at the joint of the skull and 1st vertebra , and not broken at the poll being the flexion at the 3rd cervical vertebra?    ADD....when a horse's head is "on the vertical" it is positioned with the face on a vertical line.  This is the purpose of advancing to a curb bit in dressage, or the spade in western performance.  It encourages a horse to "break at the poll" and position the head in this way, for the lightest, most indiscernable signals to be effective.|`|RloOJ43haa	Mulereiner is correct as usual. I just want to say that it's 'poll' not 'pole.'|`|XHHkBkwOaa	if a horse is broken at the pole its head will naturally form into an S shape and bend from just behind its ears and carry its head higher      if its broken from the wither which most western pleasure horses are the have an elongated neck and have it stretched right out head sorta drooped    wither is the highest point on the horses back        GAHHH WOOPS I GUESS I PICKED UP ON HER TYPO LOL      poll|`|XJ9oSR2daa	Breaking at the poll is when the horse tips his chin towards his chest.

GdBG4PGYaa	Ask the person that owns that property kind if you could go on their land for a few minutes. If you can't ask the person, then just go over and look at the tree.     Try giving the kitten some food. Get a little bit of cooked chicken, no sauce or anything. If you don't have chicken, then get a bit of cheese. Really any human food (besides chocolate) will work. :)    Then go over and set the food (have it in "large" amounts so that the kitten thinks its worth coming out/down for) on the ground and walk away. Then watch.      If the kitten is stuck in the tree, try bribing it with food, then reach up and try to grab him/her by the scruff of the neck. If the head isn't available, then try and get the chest. This works better. Then take the kitten, give him the piece of food, and bring him home.      If you get in trouble for "trespassing" tell the people you were saving a little kitten. You also tried to ask for permission to go on their land.        I hope I helped! Good luck! :D      P.S. Not to be rude, but a three week old kitten would not be that far away from his mom, or in a tree. Maybe a very small six week old kitten. Sorry if I sounded rude, I am really not trying to be. :)|`|OaQWUfNoaa	Is the kitten alone or does s/he have any litter-mates in the trunk? If it is alone it may have wandered in there, or the mother cat may be moving the litter there- or, and this is the worst case scenario, someone may have dumped the poor little thing. Try to keep checking on it to see if it is becoming distressed. Maybe you could try to reach in and gently lift the kitten out. If the kitten is clean and doesn't seem hungry, it would be apparent that the mother cat is nearby- perhaps hunting or afraid by your presence near her baby. Try to keep a watch to see if a cat comes to the trunk.    If you think the little kitten may be cold or you are sure s/he has been abandoned by its mother or dumped by someone, put an old towel of blanket in with it to help keep it warm until you can call someone to rescue it- like the RSPCA or similar (if you cannot get him/her out yourself).|`|IzRk1mZQaa	I hope I'm reading the question right.  If the cat is up in a tree, its probably a little older than three weeks, not that it matters.  Maybe your presence is scaring the mother away.  If you disappeared for a while, maybe mama cat would come and care for her kitten.  If not, find a can of tuna in oil, or sardines, its not good for the kitten to eat a lot of, but the stinky smell will be too tempting for the kitten!!  Maybe in your garage, or maybe a neighbor, has a humane trap?  If not, borrow one from animal control tomorrow, they will do that, and if theres no other beasties that can get in the tree trunk, hopefully the kitten will be okay for 24 hours.  Worse comes to worse, call animal control now, and tell them you have reason to believe the kitten might be  injured - they will come sometime tonight.|`|C1Cobi1taa	is it alone? or is it's mom with him? cause you might want to leave him be if you think he is getting food from his mom. and check with your neighbor to see if he had a cat have kittens, maybe it belongs to him. if he says that its not his, call a local cat rescue group and have them come get him and any others. do this soon! cause he might not be getting food and things can go downhill really fast! good luck!|`|TM2uTrfXaa	Do you have any tuna to coax the little one down? a ladder perhaps? I know it may sound crazy but the fire dept can get it down. or if you have a spca open or policeman may they have a bar with a loop on it to get hard to reach pets with or aggressive dogs. Hope this helps. Little ones are scared easily. so that may be why its not voluntarily coming down. good luck...
GdBG4PGYaa	When she comes to the door hovering by it, clap loudly in her face, spray her with a spray bottle and yell really loud. She will probably run away in terror. Once she runs away immediately stop what you are doing and pet her.    She will eventually learn that the door is an annoying, and scary place to be, and stay away from it.      If you want a more fast acting way get a loud bell, and attach it to your door. When people come in, it will ding so other people know somebody is coming in. Everybody who lives there needs to know that when they come in, they have to be ready to catch or block the cat.       I hope I helped! Good luck, hope it all works out! :)|`|VMY7No0eaa	when going in... FIRST PUT YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR... this makes them back up  I would take a glass of water... and when she comes near the door POUR it on her.  SHE won't like that and believe me it will end the dash|`|f1fd9f1cf1a58e760d7ffd75daa60953aa	if you can invest in a fence so she can get fresh air|`|XWAC1ohfaa	there are things called skat mats (not sure of the spelling) but you use them on spots where your cat keeps jumping on the counter or around your christmas tree is where i found them soooooo useful  but i am almost certain that you could put it in a doorway... is there a slight gap between the door and threshold? and they are not expensive and would make you have piece of mind (i have 3 cats all indoor so scared they will get out and someone will hurt them)  oh and try not to catch by the tail you can dislocate thier tails and back and cause some big problems|`|NIq7BoA7aa	put butter on her nose, its an old wives tale but it can't hurt.  Supposed to make them think the new house is home instead of trying to go to old home.|`|iYzmnIsJaa	Get a screen door.    Leash train your cat.  It has to be done slowly.  Check out websites, you tube, books from the library on cat training.  That way you can safely take your cat out every once in a while.  And that will satisfy her a little.    Play with her a lot.  Put a cat tree  near a window.  Get her a scratching post.  Put a special cat bed in a sunny room next to a window, away from the front door and maybe she'll start hanging out there more.    Have a basket of cat toys near the front door so that someone can always pick up a toy and toss it far into another room for her to chase --- leaving the person time to safely get out of the door.    Shake a can of coins to startle her away from the door.|`|8IqPiXZlaa	Is she in heat? I know alot of cats try to escape when they are in heat.....just a thought|`|b0smHWbIaa	I had a similar problem with the 7 year old cat that was given to me a few months ago.  She kept wanting to jump out the window of my house.  I was concerned with her safety and didn't want to let her out, but I began to feel bad by keeping her locked up, so what I do now is this:  I let her out in the evenings about 15 minutes before it gets completely dark, and before I feed her.  That way she leaves the house hungry and doesn't leave for too long because it's too dark and she wants to come back and eat.  This works *every time*.  Something that my uncle used to do:  He conditioned his cat to the sound of a fork hitting the can of tuna fish right before he fed the cat, so when the cat left the house, my uncle went outside with a fork and a can, made the sound for a few moments and the cat came running back.  My point with these possible solutions is that maybe you should let your cat out every once in a while.  The more you avoid it, the more your cat will want to escape and when she does, she'll probably make the most out of it by staying out for as long as she can.  I don't know how adventurous she is, but if she considers your house a home, she'll return.  After I started doing what I described first, my cat doesn't whine so much to be let out and she returns after 15 to 30 minutes.  If 30 minutes have gone by already, I open the container of dry food outside the window, or a can of food, and she races back inside.  It works great.
GdBG4PGYaa	DAYTIME:    Spray her with the spray bottle when she gets up there. Say a loud, "No!" and put her on the ground. Make a loud noise when she gets up there. Crumple up aluminum foil and then spread it out on the countertops. Cats don't like this because it makes annoying noises, and it has a weird feeling. Put something on your counters that falls when your cat jumps up. That way, she falls with it. Make sure it isn't to heavy though.       NIGHT TIME:  Buy a large kennel, and put your cat in it at night or put her in your room.       Hope I helped!      P.S. Doing the first things I told you about (DAYTIME), will help your cat learn that getting on countertops is BAD. :)|`|LxBwmRTlaa	My Cat used to do that alot. I bought a small spraying bottle, filled it up with water and would spray my Cat  saying "NO!" to scare her off furniture and also when she  would start scratching the furniture. It actually worked!|`|FmIAKDJLaa	Cats arent really trainable...|`|XWAC1ohfaa	skat mats, i used them during christams to keep the cats from climbing the tree... and on the counters where they jumped up the most and they don't try anywhere on the counter  its a small pad that slighty zaps them and scares them   doesn't hurt though|`|4ThRaoBOaa	This may sound like i am talking about a dog but you could TRY training her but i would  have to say buy a kennel. you would only need a small one and that way it would not be aloud to jump on the furniture! trust me it really works!
RloOJ43haa	KWPN is the registry for Dutch Warmbloods in Holland. I don't know the Dutch words, but I know the K stands for royal and the others mean something like Dutch Horse Registry of the Netherlands. So, horses registered with the KWPN that are in North America were registered in Holland and them imported. Horses that are listed as "Dutch Warmblood" were probably bred in North America from stock that had already been imported. They should be registered with the KWPN-NA which is the North American auxillary of the KWPN. It used to be known as the NAWPN.    EDIT - or it could be people using two different terms for the same thing.|`|58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	The KWPN, or Koninklijk Warmbloed Paardenstamboek Nederland (Royal Warmblood Studbook of the Netherlands) is the Dutch breeding organization for jumping and dressage horses, harness horses and Gelder horses. The KWPN has over 28,000 members in the Netherlands. Performance, durability and appealing conformation are the most important factors on which the international success of the Dutch warmblood horse is based.    A rigorous selection system and continuous evaluation of breeding stock, as well as a high-tech research, statistical, and records department bring the latest developments in science and technology to bear on the improvement of the Dutch horses. In addition, the long horse-breeding history and agricultural heritage of the Dutch, bring generations of nearly in-born expertise to the production of top quality Dutch horses. The main tools in the ongoing evolution and improvement of the Dutch horse are the Keurings, or inspections which are held in the Netherlands and in North America every year, at which horses are evaluated and rewarded according to their quality and fulfillment of the Breeding Goal. This system includes a very rigorous selection and testing system for breeding stallions - one of the most selective and rigorous in the world.    Unlike some warmblood registries, Dutch horses are not branded as foals based on the fact that they are "registered". Instead, in order to be branded, they must be presented for Studbook Inspection at the age of three or older. If they are of sufficient quality they are inscribed in the Studbook, and can be branded. Studbook horses are then eligible for awards or predicates assigned according to the quality of the individual, and the quality and success of the offspring. The special predicates include "star" for horses of especially good quality, "keur" for star mares who perform a good performance test and show a good offspring, "preferent" for mares who have produced particularly good offspring, and "prestatie" for mares who have produced offspring that have been especially successful in sport.     The Dutch Warmblood is long-legged but substantial with a smooth topline and dry, expressive head. They are built level to uphill in a rectangular frame. A number of traits are desirable in both directions, such as "long lines" or a rectangular frame, "balanced proportions" and attractiveness. The requirements for the two types differ in the desired interior qualities, but also in form. The exact outline of the Dutch Warmblood varies depending on the pedigree.    Since the turn of the millennium, Dutch Warmblood breeding has shifted from breeding a "riding horse" to further specialization into dressage type and jumper type horses. To protect against losing canter quality in the dressage horse and conformation, gaits and rideability in the jumper type, genetic material continues to be freely exchanged between the two types. Specialization depends on the abilities of the horse. As such, any horse NOT registered with the KWPN, claimed to be a Dutch warmblood, actually isn't considered correct.|`|AKhwa8Ixaa	I'm going to try not to confuse you with my answer...BUT the truth is they are AND are not the same horse.    How they ARE the same horse is because yes they originated from the same country and, infact, they are the same "breed".    Where they differ is in their DISTINCTION: KWPN's are APPROVED by the KWPN registery and are usually keured (inspected) and/ or placed in the registeries stud/ mare books.      Dutch WB is just the breed... this horse may or may not be approved for KWPN registeration or Warmblood breeding.  The horse might be approved for registration but might never have been inspected or approved by the registration for use in breeding.  The horse may even be a cross bred with another warmblood breed (that's un approved by that registry aka: the KWPN) or may have even been a product of a KWPN approved parent crossed with a non-warmblood breed.    I hope this answers your question in simplicity.|`|SzW9GmRsaa	What Greg said!  [Royal] Warmbloed [Somethingboek] Nederland.    KWPN are "proper" Dutch WBs.
03CZvXGNaa	get Advantage, it works great. it kills all the fleas in the house. if you can't afford it, ask someone to help you out. ask a friend, or a vet, or the humane society for a treatment. if you have to give up the cat, she won't get put down for having fleas, they will treat her and find her a home. if you don't think you can provide her the life she deserves, don't feel too guilty about giving her up.|`|eTsCJYALaa	The Humane Society will not put her down for having fleas.

Then go round the full house and spray everyhting she touches and keep her in the toilet as to not let the fleas spread and multiply again, Then once u have got the house sprayed go in and drench her in flea tretament and keep her in the toilet put her tray in there and her food for a coule of days.  Then lastly once u have done all this get a good flea treatment that works ongoing one for eg is frontline and it goes between the shoulder blades (cant mind wat its called) ask vets, and if she gets out do not let her out untill the fleas have cleared and she has a whole lot of frontline on and most importantly spray her with fronline or another flea treatment every sngle week and soon the fleas will be gone Hiip Hipp HORRAYYYY!!!!!!LOL  goodlick and best wishes, it looks harder than it is!|`|PcZxrsXAaa	did you get flea medication?, go to the Vet? or do water tourture ( bath ) to drown em out!!! :)|`|MqYfsYd0aa	even if you take the cat to the vet for a flea bath, or do anything to try and get rid of the fleas on the cat... it doesn't get rid of all the fleas around the cat.    giving away the cat, won't solve your flea problem.  cleaning the cat, carpets, and surrounding areas will.|`|6GIp6pM3aa	Bathe her in dawn dish soap, give her a 1 month flea treatment vacuum and clean your house thoroughly, make sure to throw away the vacuum cleaner bag and that should get rid of the fleas.

K0uTjeWiaa	You decide with the right info        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Remember that nature created cats to be obligate carnivores - that means that their bodies were made to eat meat, not grains.  Corn is added to cat foods because it's a cheap filler, not because it's healthy for our cats.  Same thing with by-products - that isn't meat, it's all the scrap "parts" that have been deemed unfit for human consumption.  It's such tasty things as beaks, hides, tendons, intestines, diseased meat, and the scrapings from the slaughterhouse floor and machinery.  Certainly not what you want to feed your cat!  Find a cat food free of corn and by-products, and you'll be ensuring your cats are eating a healthy diet.  Go to the pet store, and actually read the labels of what you are planning on feeding them.  The better quality foods cost more than the cheap ones, but remember that even for us humans, proper food costs more than junk food - what's better for us, a nice piece of chicken or a hot dog?|`|a29qiNkvaa	You know I just did this!

960pO2oHaa	you know, kitties def have a mind of their own.......i'd say, give her space, and time....don't pick her up (even tho i kno when u pick her up ur being loving), but give her her space. let her be. eventually she'll "adopt" you. meaning, she'll start coming up to you and stuff. you just have to let her do it on her terms.    you know she's healthy and well, that's good. now, just step away for a bit. trust me, you're not doing anything wrong, cat's just need to come to stuff on their own terms. and once they do, they're yours for life! giving her space lets her know it's all about her and not you. this helps her to trust and love.     i'm glad u've taken her to the vet, and i'm glad u're doing good by her. now, all that's required is patience. lil baby. she'll be just fine. just let her know you're there and back off. when she's comfy enough, she'll come to you.     bless u both!|`|TBPzDU2vaa	Just a thought .. did this also happen with the vet?

She might grow out of it, or she may continue to feel this way.    There's nothing wrong with a cat not liking to be picked up, and there are plenty of cats who are perfectly friendly but would prefer not to be handled.    If you continue to handle the kitten when it clearly objects, however, it's likely to associate being picked up with discomfort. If the cat doesn't want to be handled, just leave it alone.|`|oU1yUxwwaa	i have a cat too. i got her when she was a kitten. I started off really slow because she use to always run when i got close to her so i started off slowly with her. I first started with petting her all the time and making her feel very comfortable. i didn't make any sudden movements around her and finally i started sitting on the floor with her and holding her in my lap and then finally now i can pick her up and walk around with her and pretty much do anything i want without her being scared or trying to get away. start of with just petting her|`|i88MbPB3aa	Try to pick it up and just sit in your lap and rub it if it stays in your lap its working she will then stop crying as much the more she comfortable to you|`|USt4MZSBaa	she could have pain or swelling in her muscles or on her skin where you pet her|`|q8lFhmE8aa	If she starts losing her appetite, I'd have her tested for Infectious Feline Peritonitis (FIP). Our kitten contracted it (after our full-grown cat did) and couldn't stand to be held either because she was so full of pus in her abdominal area that she had trouble breathing. If your cat has it, go ahead and have her put to sleep because it will cost you a fortune in vet bills and meds to keep her alive with any decent quality of life for any length of time.|`|NIq7BoA7aa	sit down put her on your lap, hold her by the scruf of her neck, like her mom would when carrying her from place to place.  while holding her by the scruff, just calmly talk to her and pet her gently with your other hand.  give her a treat then let her go.  repeat every day|`|AA10920648	I'm glad that you took this precious baby to the vets and that she's physically fine.  Personally if she were my baby  I'd lay next to her  talk & even sing gently to her and eventually try an arm loosely around her.     This may take a week to a month. Eventually she should let you pick her up.  Remember she is a scared baby girl.    Keep in mind that each cat has his or her own personality, likes, dislikes Fears and passions.   How boring it would be if all cats were alike.    Best Wishes to You and Your,Little Girl  Louise|`|cS8DCOzKaa	Umm....toughie! I would call the vet. She may just have a bruise or something from being so "spunky"

AA11736483	An infection will make a cat feel lousy and not want to play much. Some antibiotics, although they can help with the uri, have their own sets of side effects, so it is not unusual that your cat is sleeping a lot. Just keep a close eye on him and contact the vet is there are any other changes in his behavior or habits.|`|BBZj7m0kaa	he is weak, that is the reason he his sleeping so much.
y6T6zMegaa	your budgie might be sick. Are it's feather's fluffed up? If they are and your budgie is always sleeping it might be sick. But it could also be sad too, do you usually take it out to play? My lovebirds are usually always chirping because i take them out frequently.|`|Mq2TICVmaa	Don't play the videos, because its like showing a video of kids playing and having fun to a kid with a broken leg. Is it a small cage that you can move to another room for a few hours? The change of scenery might do him good. Give him a treat of something, maybe a bit of apple or some cuttlefish.|`|9vhXo9Pkaa	yes maybe hes having a bad day

bFzu835Aaa	It's normal for all puppies to sleep a lot. If it's extremely excessive or she's hard to wake, you might need to check a few things.     Sometimes people forget that a small breed puppy needs to eat multiple times a day. If she's not getting the nutrients to turn into energy, she's going to be pooped when her reserves run out ( which will be quickly since she's a pup and a little dog which really runs up the metabolism). If it's not that, I suggest taking her to the vet (as she should have been when you first got her) and have the vet check a few things.|`|Js9t1OCJaa	its normal for all puppies to sleep.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Its normal for any breed of puppy to sleep a lot.  Just like a human child they're growing a lot!    Puppies will always seem to have have wild bursts of energy follow by a crash snooze
R0WgaUdgaa	I have something similar to this one for my 3 girls:  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...  Hope this helps a little.|`|q0Dg8a1haa	I don't get why these people who are saying it's not big enough for two is. Most rat books I've read say that the minimum for two is 24" by 14". Anyhoo, I think it would be fine, considering it's a ferret cage to start, though if you are concerned about them being cramped, maybe you can buy one of those ferret nation cages, or maybe even find a way to add on to your original cage. Good luck with your rats ;)|`|TTs6GBBUaa	Don't listen to AC they wont kill each other if you do things right.    First of all- No that cage isn't even big enough for two rats. Try to get something that is the same length and width but about a foot taller.    Secondly- When you introduce them introduce them in a neutral space like a bath tub so they wont fight over territory. Do that once a day for a week make sure to supervise them if everything goes well then clean your big cage VERY well and let the youngster into the cage with your bigger rats. MAKE SURE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THEM!! It's ok for small fights to break loose but if it gets too violent or one is screaming(not just squeaking) then take the new member out. Also if you see deep wounds accruing on any of them take the new member out and introduce them in the tub for another week.|`|4uI0dF0zaa	DONT PUT THEM TOGETHER THEY WILL KILL EACH OTHER!!!!!!! TRUST ME!!!!!!|`|IFGSOd16aa	cant see the pic :(|`|6W4ZWOetaa	I agree that cage isn't even big enough for two.  Maybe you shouldn't get a third rat right now... especially if you're travelling back and forth.
1BbnyTfBaa	An RFID chip  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microchip_i...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFID  holds a number.  When someone scans the chip, they get that number.  They call the chip maker and the chip maker looks up which vet bought that number.  They tell the vet.  The vet looks in his records and finds your name and calls you.  If you registered your chip, the chip maker will call you instead of calling the vet.    You should:  1.  Call the vet who implanted the chip (no matter how far away) and make sure that they have your name, address, and phone and that they can link it to your chip.  2.  Call the animal shelters that cover the area where your dog was lost.  Tell them what happened, what he looks like, and that he has a chip.  3.  Call the animal control officer who covers the area where your dog was lost and give him the same info as you give the animal shelters.  4.  Put up signs and walk around the neighborhood calling him.  Animals usually travel less than one mile after they are lost.  (I once found a cat that had been lost for many months and it was only 1-1/2 mile from home.)    Good luck!|`|dc82fe490b4d19e3c38b3691578d98a3aa	Ok so this is what I would do.  I would let your local vet know whats going on.  Call and go over with a picture of your dog.  Post signs around your neighborhood and even further that your dog is missing and that he is a sick dog and needs his medication. Say that is has a nervous disorder or something and that he needs to be returned because of that.  If someone picks your dog up and wants to pass it up for theirs and sees these signs they will most likely go to the vet and try to get the meds themselves.  The vet will then scan the dog and BANG! you get your dog back.  Also notify animal shelters and what not, but don't let anyone know that your dog is micro-chipped except for the vet and animal shelter.|`|u4WU01EXaa	Did you say that you adopted the dog? if the chip was there when you got it, it could still be registered under the previous owners details.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	First off, you should be out tacking up flyers to lamp posts. Preferably with a photo of your dog and of course your contact info.  Next, contact local shelters, and the one vet.  Thirdly, place an ad in the lost & found section of the local newspaper.  The flyers will work the best though. I hope you get your little one back and I bet he'll come home on his own after doing a little exploring.  When you get him back make sure he is always wearing a collar that has a tag with your phone   on it. And if he isn't neutered please do it, dogs with all their boy parts will wander off at the slightest whiff of a female in heat.|`|oGVWdnHraa	The chip does not act like a GPS, and it is only effective if you got the chip registered, it is worth calling the vet in the next township because the dog catcher or some one else may have picked him up and taken him there :)|`|3zv2bbolaa	If you did not register your dog and chip number at the time it was implanted, they won't have any way of linking the dog to you. There are no commercially available GPS tracking chips for dogs at this time. There are some GPS enabled collars, but these are easily broken or removed.|`|fmHHcFd5aa	if its a homeagain chip its not so much a gps its more or less if someone finds it and they scan it your info will pop up. You can call around to all the vets that are local and even the one in a diff. township. They can put ads up of the lost pet and if its scanned and it has your number on the info they will call and tell you where they have the pet. you cant just track them down like a gps no. theres no way of pinpointing them or more people would locate a lost pet. its just a chip that has your info.|`|eTsCJYALaa	I work at a shelter and we scan all the stray dogs we receive for microchips. When the number comes up we call the chip registry and locate the owner. As long as the person has the same contact info that they provided when the dog was chipped then we can locate them. Call the police department and find out where the Animal Control Officer brings the dogs he finds roaming or call your local shelter.|`|aCqSF87Raa	I would call that vet, it wouldn't be useless - alert them just in case your dog made it that far (or was picked up by someone and brought in.) I would also start posting photos and calling all vets withing a few hours drive of you (in case the dog was taken out of the area.) Visit any local shelters and talk with your neighbors to let them know.    The chip more than likely is just a device that acts as an ID tag - a vet or shelter worker would scan it, pop the number in a computer, then your ID info would come up. Some do have GPS (i THINK) but those are usually specially requested and you would KNOW for sure if you had one (your registration paper work would tell you as well.)    I would keep the chip between you and the vet and/or shelter - if your dog was stolen and you broadcasted it, whoever took the dog may avoid places that scan for them. If you keep it "secret" then they may slip up and go to a vet in the area (if you call all vets you can find, they will be on the lookout so to speak..)|`|nAdCT2lzaa	Thats what the chip is for...|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	yea what trick said|`|xggSASTwaa	yes they do but you must find out where the chip came from in order to track the dog. you must have some paperwork for the dog right?|`|Mq2TICVmaa	Contact the local pound or dogs home and ask them for assistance. You could still try the vet, just ask what they think you should do.|`|qGKANnYoaa	the chip does not act as a gps but simply records your information|`|JOz2Zl26aa	first of all did u register the chip alot of people think the chip automatically knows where u live|`|rNdun1V7aa	i believe the chip that is implanted in animals does not work like a gps, it is just scan-able, and the owners info will come up. someone will have to find him, turn him in to a vet or shelter, then they would have to contact you. they will don't worry :) call around asap and put flyers up to help.|`|OFpl236faa	The chip has your info on it, so if it is up to date and your dog is taken to a vet or shelter, they will be able to contact you. I would make some flyers up, call the vet and local shelter and give them a description of your dog. Also go and drive around and look for your doggie. Good luck in your search!|`|0d3c41aa4dace05f52b3aab76ed56c40aa	why did you put a Pringle in your dog?|`|icOWU8lBaa	no all those chips do is record the owner and the id info and keep it safe, if he is picked up anywhere they can scan that chip and get the info and contact you to come get him, but its not a gps|`|60FT7Pzcaa	Calling the vet is the best option. They have the info on the registry for the chip and how to track him. Good luck!|`|SkA6nfzraa	u shud have known it b4 u lost yurdog.. but sorry 4 yur pain|`|GfG4PfjMaa	You didn't say who put the chip into the dog, my first response would be to go to where ever that facility is located or call them and ask what best to do.    Additionally alert the police.  Most dogs run around for a bit and they instinctively find their way home, you didnt say how you lost him, if he ran off or if you left him tied somewhere and he got away.    Good luck in finding him.  If he is gone for more that a day or so, it's likely someone took him in.      If he hasn't come back by tomorrow, I would put notices up in the community, just to let people know to be on the look out for him.|`|YBNfljJYaa	ya its like a gps it tracks your dog.so if you dont know how to use it go to a vet and ask them thats what i did and they showed me how to use it.|`|Xc9KZ4Fxaa	You need to contact the vet that inserted the microchip to find out what kind of microchip was inserted. However, that would not help you. The microchip is only discovered in the dog if someone finds the dog and it is taken somewhere where it can be scanned for the microchip. At that time, all the dog's information will show up on the scanner.|`|hBHA006haa	If a pound or animal shelter find you dog, they have a scanner. They will scan you pet's body for the chip. The scanner will then have the serial number of you pet's micro chip. They will enter the number into the computer, and your Information will appear. They will give you a phone call and if you say yes it is your dog they will bring them back safe and sound! ;D    You should probably put up fliers though, since you live so far.\    Hope I helped.  xoxo Maddie
5PsKGss7aa	Frontline works wonders for fleas & ticks(all our 7 use it & works like a charm), so as long your vet says its ok for your dog and if you follow the directions, then it should be fine.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Maybe - according to the co. you wait 48hr before or after applying to bathe.  You also have to use a pet shampoo w/o any soap or detergent cuz it will remove the spot-on treatment. You will need to vacuum well daily & remove from the home. Treat again in 30days.(spot on)|`|rIQXNxn5aa	Thats fine but don't do that too often. And for baths, try Flea shampoo, it smells pretty good too. i'm pretty sure it's Frontline, so it's good.|`|wFPnYWZiaa	we just got a new dog who had fleas and he rid them quickly after just 2 flea baths and some medication she should be fine brush her every day and try getting a flea comb to get the dead fleas out a rinse out with water no soap bath is always helpful to|`|SEvhwIXQaa	Do you keep your dog in the house with you?  (Or apartment?)  If so, you definitely need to use a "bug bomb" in your house.  Go to Home Depot or ACE Hardware.  Ask for a bug bomb and they will know what you mean.  Follow the directions carefully and DO NOT leave your dog in the house while you use the bug bomb.  Bug bombs are the only way to get rid of fleas in your house.  If you get rid of them off your dog and they are still in the house, they will go back on your dog.  And you.  Good luck.|`|6cD9Ig2oaa	I use frontline all the time as preventative measure and never had a problem. I understand that you NEEDED to bath her! If your vet said it was fine, it probably is....  Frontline will kill what's on her and prevent others from jumping on (unless something freaky happened and the bath counteracted it) so you SHOULDN'T have a re-infection.....  ugh...I hate fleas....good luck!|`|vzHVprfDaa	I don't know if frontline works. But, If it doesn't work, try Advantix.
gjD8pndjaa	Thats pretty typical teenage puppy behavior.    She might calm down slightly when she's mature, but some dogs are more active that others|`|syT3XUAraa	Ahhhh! The dreaded puppy stage! I went through the exact same thing with my dog. She will eventually slow down as she matures, but if you want peace now, then I would recommend spaying her. That usually halts them in their tracks. She will be healthier, and the only thing you'll have to worry about then is under-activeness. Good luck!|`|PM23RDycaa	Puppy stage combined with owning a do with beagle genes. She's not going to calm down until she matures and has some training.|`|oGVWdnHraa	At least not for another year, she is still very young so is still going to have a lot of energy, spaying her may get some of her energy down, and training should help you redirect it :)|`|mfXDUkRYaa	That will be the Beagle in her!    Try tiring her out mentally. The Beagle part of her was bred for hunting by scent. You could try hiding some treats around the room and get her to find them. If this is easy for her you could try it with different things and try it outside. Use your imagination and make it fun!|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	shes a pup so dont expect it to change for at lease another 6 months|`|6jem21vhaa	I have a 3 year old puggle so I can say this with all honesty.      Never.      Puggles are basically puppies for life.  They love to play, they are always hyper, and they never calm down.  They are energy 24/7.  I like to describe Kobe (our puggle) as having the craziness of a pug, with the energy of a beagle.  They are a lot of fun, but that's the kind of insanity you are in for with this breed.    Hope you like having a crazy dog.  :)
lhOd2hvXaa	A change in toilet habits in an adult dog is indeed cause for worry.  An increase in fluid intake is also cause for worry.  I'd recommend a trip to the veterinarian for a complete workup.    Good Luck!|`|jazKtgENaa	Clearly there is something wrong you need to take him to the vet.|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	check ur self b4 checking the dog, has ur routine changed?|`|KxjUim7yaa	Excessive pee and drinking is a bad sign. Please have the vet check him. Use Nature's Miracle on the carpet spots.|`|JOz2Zl26aa	has a new dog moved into the neighbor hood if so he could be marking his home or if its a female that has gone into heat (that's if he's not neutered) he could be saying hey im right here stop on over  for some a lil somethin somethin|`|aCqSF87Raa	If anything has changed in her routine, that could affect behavior. The sudden increase in drinking suggests maybe something medical is bothering him - have a vet check him over.     If nothing is medically wrong, i would just revert to potty training basics - monitor food and water intake (NEVER limit a dog's water unless told by a veterinarian... dogs can dehydrate very easily), bring him outside after eating/drinking/playing/napping, keep him on a leash when you bring him out and BE SURE he goes, clean up all pee spots with proper cleaner, do not let him out of your sight in the house, watch for potty signs.    I would also go back to basic obedience and start over. More treats for proper behavior and obeyed commands, start small and work your way up. Don't get frustrated or your dog will notice and that may affect his behavior.    Any time a dogs behavior drastically changes, have a vet look the dog over for medical problems. Then evaluate your life and see if anything has changed - new people, people leaving, new house, different surroundings (redecorating), etc.|`|9h95rnHPaa	Take him to the vet. It could be a health issue or something else.|`|niOtGNdMaa	Your dog must be bored    Obviously you have to have a right time for him to eat, so then you can get accustomed at what time he goes to the bathroom    He should never be allowed on the carpet again, for the carpet feels good on his paws.    Take him outside more often, maybe every three hours for the first week, and make a schedule to see what time he is actually doing his business    Water should also be limited, so you can control the peeing. What breed is he? Look at best quantity and how often for a particular breed.    Well I hope I was some use to you ^_^|`|TsguawO9aa	A change in the amount of water intake can indicate a kidney or bladder problem in dogs and cats....he does need to see a vet, it sounds like in his own "uncomfortable" way he's trying to let you know somethings wrong. Serious get this checked before it does some permanent damage.|`|wFPnYWZiaa	The same thing is going on with our lab. As he got older he stopped listening and barks constantly just for attention or for no reason. Sometimes the going on the carpet can be a sign they want attention. Try scolding for bad behavior and reward him when he goes outside to potty or when he sits and does things you like.|`|6cD9Ig2oaa	there could be.....a vet might not be a bad idea    what about his routine? or attention? sometimes my old dog would act out if he was mad at me.   What has changed in your household? because a strange behavior change doesn't just happen just because, there is a reason....|`|TZDQI6v4aa	Seems like "Snoodle" & you know each other well. Drinking lots of water is a clear sign he needs to go to your vet for a check.  I recon you will find your answer there Good Luck|`|GfG4PfjMaa	Your dog is getting older, lazy and is behaving out.  You have to go back to the initial training and if Snoodle's isn't catching on, redo elementary cage training until he catches on again.    Cage training is Snoodles stays in the cage all day until he needs to eat and go out and if he gets behaved again he can come out of the cage.    He will cry.|`|f7OusW9zaa	I would have him evaluated by a Vet. They will probably need to run some blood work on him. Could be diabetes or kidney disease (not saying these are the only reasons, just a couple of possibilities). Both of these will cause the water intake increase. Also will make him feel badly enough that he might have an accident in the house when he wouldn't normally. He may be distracted by pain or is uncomfortable, and that is why he is not paying attention to you.

871f0e15f0d49545f27f78f43647edd3aa	If there is swelling, you need to take the cat to the vet.  He might have cellulitis or an infection that could cause blood poisoning.  He may need to have the infection drained and the vet will prescribe antibiotics.  Or, like you said it is broken.  It was nice of you to help this cat, don't let him down now.  He needs to go to the vet.  If you wait, the infection will get worse and more expensive.  An after hours vet charges about $100 just for an appointment, but it depends, you will have to call and ask how much they charge.  You could leave a message at a regular hours vet's and you may get a less costly emergency appointment charge and an appointment tomorrow or the next day.  My vet charges $25.00 for appointments made with less than 24 hour notice.  The cat is no longer a stray; it is your responsibility since you have owned it.  I think if you feed an animal for 3 three days, it becomes yours legally.  Your all this cat has.  You will worry yourself to death if you let it go on pain.  Find a vet that takes a credit card or something.  And try to save for these types of emergencies or take the cat to the pound if you can't afford to care for it.|`|RyU2o8Tqaa	sound like he has an abscess from another cats bite.. he needs a shot of antibiotics.. and some pills.. around $150|`|s80ED7Ygaa	Go..NOW!|`|eeiNlnqRaa	call ur vet and explain what is happening and that you dont have the money right now. most vets will take care of your cat first and then once he is ok set up a payment plan.

SytfXV6Haa	As all small pets, rabbits are very good at hiding their illnesses and by the time you recognize a sign of illness it may be too late. Rabbits are prone to gastrointestinal stasis (GI Stasis). Although the size of the string and the amount is important, to be safe I would bring your rabbit in to see a vet that specializes in small pets (especially if the vet specializes in rabbits. Look for ones that say they are an exotic pet vet. A small animal/pet vet is usually cats and dogs). You could also see if you can ask an exotic pet vet to give you their opinion on the phone on whether or not this warrants a vet visit. Definitely keep an eye on your rabbit in the meantime to make sure that it isn't exhibiting any signs of illness.|`|H4Dqfepiaa	It depends on how much it was... because of her age, though, I wouldn't take any chances and get her to a rabbit specialist immediately, if you do not know of one go to this website to find one near you:    www.rabbit.org/vets    I'm pretty sure it sounds like she'll be able to digest it, providing that she didn't have more than 2 inches of it. Either way you should get a rabbit specialist to see her :)

5I7MZjHuaa	1. Rabbits need hay for the well-being of their gastrointestinal system (guts)  Pellets are not needed, and most rabbits are better off without them.  For more diet info... http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/diet....    2. Toys!!       *  Paper Bags and Cardboard boxes for crawling inside, scratching, and chewing. Bunnies like them much more when there are at least two entry points into the boxes. Chris Rosenzweig has some  Great Tips on Building Bunny Box Toys      * Cardboard concrete forms for burrowing      * Cardboard roll from paper towels or toilet paper      * Untreated wicker baskets or boxes full of: shredded paper, junk mail, magazines, straw, or other organic materials for digging      * Yellow Pages for shredding      * Cat toys: Batta balls, and other cat toys that roll or can be tossed      * Parrot toys that can be tossed, or hung from the top of the cage and chewed or hit      * Baby toys: hard plastic (not teething) toys like rattles and keys, things that can be tossed      * Children's or birds' mobiles for hitting      * "Lazy cat lodge" (cardboard box with ramps and windows) to climb in and chew on. Also, kitty condos, tubes, tunnels, and trees      * Nudge and roll toys like large rubber balls, empty Quaker Oat boxes and small tins      * "Busy Bunny" toys      * Plastic Rainbow slinkies      * Toys with ramps and lookouts for climbing and viewing the world      * Dried out pine cones      * Jungle gym type toys from Toys R Us      * A (straw) whisk broom      * A hand towel for bunching and scooting      * Untreated wood, twigs and logs that have been aged for at least 3 months. Apple tree branches can be eaten fresh off the tree. Stay away from: cherry, peach, apricot, plum and redwood, which are all poisonous.      * Untreated sea grass or maize mats from Pier One or Cost Plus      * Things to jump up on (they like to be in high places)      * Colorful, hard plastic caps from laundry detergent and softener bottles. They have great edges for picking up with their teeth, make a nice "ponk" sound when they collide, and the grip ridges molded into the plastic make a neat "rachety" sound when rabbits digs at the cap. The caps are nice for human-stacks-on-floor and bun-knocks-down kind of games. Note: Be sure not to choose caps from caustic material bottles (e.g.drain uncloggers, bathroom cleaner bottles) since a residue of the cleaner might remain no matter how much washing off you do.     Take a read of... http://www.rabbit.org/journal/3-6/chew-s...  http://www.rabbit.org/journal/3-6/play-e...    3. It sounds too hot for the rabbit. Rabbits can't cope with much heat. If your must keep him in the heat, give him things to cool down on. A very good thing many rabbit lovers do is.. Get an empty bottle, fill it with water, freeze it and then give it to bunny, as something nice and cool to lean against.     http://www.rabbit.org/ is a fantastic website for rabbit care|`|rR5nIklWaa	ok 1st u need to get rabbit food pellets  thats  there main diet  and occasionally they can have carrots but not too much because it will give them the shits  nothing else  NO LETTUCE  IKD about toys but i  used to walk my bunny  with a chuwawa harnesss and leash out in back yard  and he can eat grass  he loved hooping around in snow too  they can stand the cold thats why they have such a thick coat and i live in pa so we get snow  he loved it its the heat u have to worry about  i was  gone 4 a week and my boyfreind mom killed my bunny  she had it outside under a tree  with no water in hot *** weather and  they need a fan or bring inside in summer unlessts cool out|`|xR5mCcD8aa	Your bunny will need pellets but for right now you can feed him lettuce,carrots,apple,banana.They love playing with toilet paper rolls and love chewing on cardboard.Please give him lots of shade and lots of water.|`|dpgPsVnaaa	1. buy pellets .. and grass (timothy)    2. toilet paper roles and tissue boxes    3  make sure outdoors have shade ... rabbits love fans|`|qRvEFP9Jaa	yaaaaa wat he said!!!!! lol|`|R3glUmwHaa	1.  You should get pellets, and they should have timothy hay too    2.  They like toys.  You could buy some toys from a pet store or Walmart.  Mine used to like these blocks that we brought him and there were these food wheel things that we clipped to the side of his cage that he liked to play with sometimes.    3.  don't know
n4pNNcGfaa	Dogs do sleep a lot, but she shouldn't be sleeping all the time.  Perhaps it's boredom.  She should learn how to entertain herself with her own toys when you aren't available to play.    You could try hiding her food instead of giving it to her in a bowl.  Dogs tend to think that's a great game and it exercises their minds.  Try a stuffed kong, or buster cube.
D1beU6MPaa	They don't need a search warrant to go into anybody's yard. And if the dog has a scratch that is concerning the authorities, I would rather pay a vet bill than court costs. The authorities must think it needs attention or they would not make that kind of statement. It could get infected, and it is probably more serious than even you know about. I would not hesitate to take the dog to the vet.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	oh come on---If the authorities are involved  it is more than a little cut. They wouldn't be there if it was just a little scratch.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	well if he was told so...then he needs to do it.|`|5PsKGss7aa	there must be something wrong with the "Scratch" if authorities stepped in.  He should just go and get it checked out at the vet.  Also,if the dog was just roaming aroundor was visible from the road,they more then likely didnt even go on his property.      ADD:  I really doubt they are doing this to just get his dog to become "Police" dogs or whatever.          .|`|Lalr2Jayaa	First, you can get the authorities for not having a warrant unless the dog was in plain sight. As for the cut, it really depends on how deep it is and whether or not it appears infected. Usually though, I'd guess no. Common sense and observation should answer the question more appropriatly.|`|WtljrYZpaa	Is it really a little scratch, or something more serious? My dogs go rabbit chasing and are always covered in small scratches- I treat them with salt water and keep an eye on them, anything more and they go straight to the vet. Why doesnt your friend see a vet in any case, just to keep everyone happy?|`|TWfDAYK4aa	Ordinarily, I would say treat it at home,assuming it is a very small scratch that can be treated at home,  but since the authorities are involved, I really don't see how your friend has any other choice but to take the dog to a vet for medical care.  He will need that proof of vet care, the receipt, in case the authorities really do come back and decide to pursue it.|`|lnZexIzmaa	Well I think that he should have a vet check it out. If they didnt have a search warrant then he could sue them if he wants to, well you could in CT.|`|f7OusW9zaa	Not all injuries require a vet. If he does indeed only have a small scratch, just cleaning it and putting some triple antibiotic ointment for on it a few days will probably fix it (and of course watching it so it doesn't get infected).    But... since the authorities have gotten involved, I don't think he has a choice but to take the dog to the vet or face charges against him.
Kntsw4Hdaa	Take your kitty to the vet.  Sometimes physical or mental illnesses can cause cats to meow that frequently.|`|RVbxTmLaaa	He is homesick, he has been with your parents for 14 years, he is not used to his new surroundings.|`|niMim3jNaa	Well I know this sounds absolutely awful, but, possibly a shock collar? One made especially for cats. We go to a very reputable vet and that was his suggestion for our small dogs. Also, try spraying with vinegar instead of just water. It won't harm the cat at all, but eventually it should get the hint that each time it makes that noise, it gets a very yucky, unpleasant liquid in it's face. Hope this helps!    Also, congrats on having an affectionate cat! They are usually all so standoff-ish.
gU34xa9vaa	With your baby daughter due so soon, there must be a lot of anticipation and excitement in your house, and your cat is picking up on this and wondering what it will mean to him.He's attention seeking,so if you could spend as much time as possible making a fuss of him before the baby arrives, making him feel secure and still loved and wanted, the phase will probably pass. It could be that he did it accidentally the first time and once that happens,even though you'll have cleaned the place, he will still smell it and need to 'refresh' it. Wash the place he does it,with biological washing liquid in hot water as that removes every last trace of any smell. When the baby arrives, try to set some time aside for your cat, maybe when she's asleep.It will be lovely for your little girl to grow up with a pet in the house.  Good luck, I hope all goes well for you.|`|y2ywR3X9aa	is there any chance that in all the excitement of the upcoming baby that the designated pooper scooper (should not be you) is not cleaning the box as often? we did that and our cat let us know by pooping beside the litter box.also if it is not changed as often the litter can be damp and they dont like that and wont scratch around in it or step in it. cats are funny that way.they will lick their own butt but wont touch damp cat litter.go figure|`|OH3oIPgqaa	He notices a different change in you. Try to calm him down. Then, once he does, he/she will stop.|`|5Uo1rzX8aa	Cats tend to be very clingy to a mom when they are pregnant, it is their nature to protect them. The cat could feel that if she poops in the litter box she is too far away from the mom and some harm could happen. Put the cat in the litter box every once in a while til he poops, so he will know its ok.|`|fA42bQHraa	Cat attract cat litter (in the source) gets them in the box.    If it's a behavioral/emotional issue (he's showing his displeasure with you), it won't work, but it's something to try.|`|cgm0vsdoaa	If he is acting like this because he's upset or clingy or anxious, try to reassure him that things are fine, pay him a lot of attention. Also something that might help - chech around at local vet clinics and big name pet stores, or even the internet if you can't find any there, for some type of calming room spray or air diffuser thing:  http://www.drsfostersmith.com/pic/articl...  more specifically these seem like they might be a good idea:  http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/pr...
djmqoFSTaa	I'm betting it's dehydration...horses just don't drink enough water sometimes in the winter.      You can do like you are...and giving her a "wet" mash.  You can also add beetpulp or some kind of pellets...**I use alfalfa pellets and rice bran pellets**  I also DO NOT drain the water off.    You could add a heater to her water...making it not so cold for the horse to drink.    You can also add salt to her mash...causing the horse to be more thirsty and drink more.  I would use a tablespoon a day.    I also add salt to the hay flakes.  I use the salt to prevent mold because I live in a rainy area...I sprinkle it between hay bales...but the horses still ingest the salt along with the hay...and drink more.|`|z90jPBMLaa	Make sure she always has water and start adding Corn oil to her feed in the PM and keep up with the Barn. Don't Water down the Bran to much. Just put enough water to get it all damp. Corn Oil will help reduce the risk of colic. add about 1/4 cup of oil to the feed. also wet down her hay.|`|H2gwQac6aa	i know the feeling, i had an old full loan horse, he was prone to colic! its a nasty ilness and it really affects the horse, not to mention you!  the best way to prevent it is to have plenty of water, also keep food portions the same or if you want to change make gradual changes, if your horse is turned out in a field with grass not too long, if the grass is very long only turnout for a short amount of time.  the best way to try and cure gas cholic is not to panic, simply put a head collar on your horse and walk her for a while, the walking releases the trapped gasses in the stomach.  also make sure she is warm enough.  i hope this helps you, good luck in the future :D xx|`|AA10726599	Banamine is fine to help with the pain UNTIL a vet can get there. My vet always gives mineral oil even in minor colics. He sometimes has to give IV fluids if they are dehydrated. I think I would find a new vet.|`|ynxdbEyPaa	I've had horses for years.  Currently I care for a mare that is 29 and suffers colic which has become impactions frequently.  Between the Vet and myself, we give her bran mash mixed with mineral oil and warm water every other day.  We are in the Lake Sunapee are of NH.  This has reduced this problem quite well.  My Vet allows for me to have Banamine paste on hand and I give a half dose if she the minute she doesn't want to eat. By the way she has a free feed salt block and heated water.  Sometimes they just don't drink enough.  The Vet calls her my "fair weather horse".  Good luck.|`|qw9ZjAlDaa	My first thought too was that she isn't getting enough water.  I second everything black bunny suggested but also wanted to add the idea of giving her electrolytes to encourage drinking.  That way you KNOW the horse is getting that salt.  (They come in lots of forms but if you get them in tubes like wormer you can pretty much guarantee your horse is ingesting it).    You can also soak your hay.  The water will leach the nutrients out so feed the hay AND the water it was soaked in--just put it all in a big bucket and give it to the horse.|`|sKZbK6Y5aa	Get yourself a heated bucket. She probably is not getting enough water.  We have heated buckets for our horses and they drink ALOT in the wintertime,just as much as summer.  Plus if she has a tooth that is bothering her she is not going to drink cold water, it will bother her too much.  Also hay your horse first, water  and then grain .  then check the water again.  be careful if she isnt getting enough water she could possibly choke.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	You can add electrolytes into the grain to make your horse thirstier.  If she drinks more she will colic less hopefully.  Probiotics can also boost the digestive system so she will colic less.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Hours of walking is never advised and will exhaust and further stress your horse, especially if she is dehydrated.  I would stop feeding bran....It can cause gas, inflammation, and colic.  It has been researched extensively, so this is not just my personal opinion....it is a proven fact.  Add water to her regular feed so you don't disturb her already compromised intestinal function. I would also gradually quit feeding grain and give her more hay 24/7 to balance the bacteria in her gut.  Colic can be the result of an ongoing process that develops over days. I would not assume that this is over, since the cause has not been determined.  Medicating with Banamine without doing anything to diagnose or treat the cause is not helping your horse.  I would call a different vet since the one you have is not acting according to what is current and accepted practice in treating colic.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	It sounds like they are not doing well in this cold hard winter then, also they're older. My white arabian died two years ago he was 21 and got colic he is gone now, but I'm sorry I can't be of more help, I guess I would just keep doing what the vet says.|`|AA11570905	There are supplements you can give this time of year to encourage horses to drink more water.  This is a very common cold weather problem.  There is no grass so horses must eat dry hay, yet the weather is cold so they don't feel like drinking water as much....not enough water intake plus dry diet of hay equals colic.    http://www.valleyvet.com/ct_detail.html?...  or  http://www.valleyvet.com/ct_detail.html?...|`|T7QN2IzGaa	If you need her to drink there are supplements and additives for water. Quench is what it might be called.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	http://www.ehow.com/how_2067857_treat-co...
TNOQk3Fjaa	My cat licks belly naked. Its sometimes caused by stress but their is medication for it. I am sorry I dont remember the medication name my vet gave me. As a start have your vet give your cat a cortizone shot until the medication kicks in.
TTLIp8Beaa	well, i originally started riding english at age 4. when i was 12 i fell off my horse over a jump and sprained my neck. when the time came for me to get back on a horse i was terrified of jumping. so i decided to ride western for a bit. i totally loved it and continued with western for 2 1/2 years. it was great fun and i won several western pleasure classes but eventually i got the jumping bug again and switched back to english. sometimes i still ride western, but not often. it's not very common where i live so i mostly just do trails and whatnot. its fun, but i take english more seriously.    hope this helps!|`|eXDDODfHaa	western
IMPvzBk1aa	Are you sure it isn't just the skin twitching to shoo biting insects away?  It would help if you give a more detailed description of the nature of the twitching.    ADD....I don't know what would be causing twitching isolated to that one area, but if it were my horse I would be on the phone to my vet to discuss it. The location will be a clue to where a lesion or other cause is stemming from.|`|XL62syrCaa	You need to get a vet out ASAP. It could be a neurological problem (IE seizures) or any number of problems. Call the vet NOW. If it is something serious then the sooner its found the sooner it can be treated. If its not then better safe then sorry.

Ive never seen this so id say call your vet just to make sure. It could be life or death...who knows =/ Good luck!
wSc7ZdBCaa	You've got some good suggestions so far.   Depending on the length of drive way you need to cross there is also:  "ice carpet runners". This is supposed to "adhere" to the ice (used by elderly facilities at entrances, etc.) and makes a solid surface to walk across. It would need to be put down and picked up after each use. I have also seen remnants priced very cheaply that have rubber backing, I would think they might also work. Again, you'd need to put down and pickup between uses (and kept in a dry place).  The use of salt and sand will work. Let the salt do it's "job" before adding the sand and taking the horse across. You will need to examine the path each time you plan on using it. (Adding more as needed.) You'll need to continue doing this every time you have new snow/ice.     "I" always felt better knowing the horses has some form of shelter during the winter. I realized that they could probably handle the weather (like the "wild horses"  who have survived forever!), but why test their "strength and stamina"  if it's not absolutely necessary?     Hope "we've" helped you with your need to save your horse unnecessary stress and possible injury.  P.S. After you have FIXED the path and when you first try to cross the path with the nervous horse try having the favorite treat (carrot pcs, apple, etc.). Hold out a few treats as you start out. Speak, sing or whistle to provide distraction and calming. You'll know what will work the best with your horse.   Wishing you great success and an early spring! ;)|`|eXDDODfHaa	horses can live outside. they have coats that keep them worm  is there grass near by?  walk her in the grass because its not slippery|`|pS8A05NTaa	salt the pavement a little while before you put her out    the way it sounds, it's going to take a lot of salt|`|EqTh6LRPaa	I too live in Tennessee and I am feeling your pain!  I would leave mine up in the barn until we thaw out. I too wouldnt want any injuries so maybe consider leaving her inside until this artic air passes. It will be over soon. But as others have stated you can buy de-icing salt from walmart, lowes, home depot, ect to de-ice walkways|`|bXcmhRUOaa	I agree with Banks.  We've also had some serious ice here in PA, and I've kept my horses inside because it is just too dangerous to put them out.  I'd rather they get a little stir crazy than break a leg, or slip and fall and not be able to get up.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	We salt whenever an ice storm is predicted and getting started before it freezes solid.  But once the ice is formed, you can still combine salting with breaking the ice up using a tool (I can't think of the name) that looks like a shovel, but is made to chop up the ice.  The tool only works well if you salt first.  If your horse has shoes, you can have either borium or studs put on, or have them removed (best). We always keep plenty of salt on hand for these storms, since where I live, it occurs frequently.  Hopefully you can find salt down there where it isn't needed that often.  You can also lay manure on your path and hope it freezes into the ice to create some traction.    here is an article on managing horses in icy conditions.................  http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx...|`|px27V5N9aa	There are a few things you can do.    1.  Spread old shavings with manure along for her to walk on.  Make a path for the both of you.  This is what I had done in New Hampshire.    2.  Spread Kitty Litter or Sand to make a safe walk way.  You can pick bags of sand up at Home Depot/Lowes, etc.  Kiddy play sand.  Kitty litter will make a clay like mess..warning! :)    3.  I don't suggest salt as it's a drying agent to the hooves but in this instance I'd do it then spread sand.|`|XL62syrCaa	You might want to either keep her outside 24/7 (it wont hurt her. Her coat is made to keep her warm. It has a layer of insulation) or keep her inside until the ice thaws a little. I would suggest the first one. She wont get cold and if you are worried about it put a warm blanket on when its really snowy to keep her from getting wet. Thats what i would do. horses fare just fine in the cold and snow and ice.|`|AA10776535	I do what buckingfun suggested, old manure and shavings...hey and you are recycling.  This works well in muddy areas, my corrals turn into for the lack of a better term...a clay like, slippery ice skating rink.  A add this and my horses are not standing in mud, nor slipping everywhere.  My neighbors without horse come steal from my pile for their driveways.  Believe me this works, i have tried other things and this was the best way to deal with this.  Sand can help mixed with it too.  I wouldn't use kitty litter or salt.  Plus this is free girl :)|`|sbB0TpGXaa	Throw wood ashes on top the ice and she will stop sliding.  Try it! It works wonders!    Other things that can be used if you can't get any wood ashes are....    1.  salt such as rock salt or even table or canning salt but those can get expensive for large areas.    2.  Kitty litter -- the hard clay kind.  (In fact in the winter I try to keep a container with me so that if I get stuck I can throw some under the tires for added traction to get out.    3.  sand    4.  sawdust    In fact virtually anything that can be lightly strewn over the ice so that the horse's hooves don't slide.    Spread only a light covering.  No need to try to make it a quarter inch thick.  Just a dusting will be fine.  I have even used bed shavings in a pinch.|`|8cikAYp3aa	my old barn turned into a ice rink anytime is snowed.  We tossed sand, gravel,, kitty litter, wood stove pine pellets or pet safe salt out nearly daily... Put the salt out after you take her out, it will melt off the drive for the return trip.  Also.. laying a small tarp across the drive way at night will make it easier to remove the ice/snow in the morning.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Put some ice melt (rock salt) on your driveway, like a lot of it where you walk your horse. Maybe you could find some boots for her with rubber grips on the bottom like these:    http://www.horseloverz.com/Old-Mac-Hoof-...    http://www.horseloverz.com/Old-Mac-S-Hor...|`|NwhrZt9Saa	well, I live in new england and it is always really icey(did i spell that wrong?) We usually put salts on it. That wouldn't really prevent it, but it melts it. You can buy it in a big bag at a gas station, walmart, hardware store, and here even in the supermarket. I don't really know how you could calm him down though, sorry. Hope this helps!|`|tc2I7k3yaa	i have the same problem here at the minute with my horse! haha.  either keep him in all day just til the ice and snow clear.. or do what i do...  take a kettle or bucket full of warm/hot water and pour it out on the path you which to take your horse! it will melt the ice hence she wont want to rush and wont slip [:  it works!|`|7e0MOQFWaa	i wont be too elaborate because everyone has pretty much used my ideas up, but try to melt it with boiling water or shovel the snow to the sides BEFORE it gets icy or get some hoof rubber grips...|`|VmZKZjP1aa	I have these same problems    1. Make sure you always shovel a path across your driveway about 4-5 ft wide. Then put down some "ice Melt" to melt the ice. It may take several coats before all the ice is gone. Here's a link to some:  http://www.amazon.com/Keep-Green-KIG40-S...  It's in almost every store where I live.  Note: Salt is a drying agent for hooves but if it's just on your driveway and she's only on it to cross--she will not get enough on her hooves to matter. You could try sand.   Hot water will help melt it temporarily..the only problem is hot water will eventually freeze, and make a more slick surface. It couldn't hurt to try  2. Take her shoes off. Horses won't slip around as much if they are barefoot  3. Is there any way you can go the long route. I have to take mine across my driveway occasionally. If the snow is not too deep I will take them the long way across our grass and through some bushes. They don't prefer it, but it's better than them slipping.   4. Leave her in the pasture as much as possible. Then she won't be cooped up in the barn so much and have so much energy and freak out.     I hope this helps. If all else fails you could look into some horse easy boots. I know they make boots made with metal studs to help with ice. But this would be an expensive investment. Here's a link: http://www.easycareinc.com/Other_Product...  Scroll down to the "boot studs" info.     Good luck
yhgRaBPXaa	I had to put my dog down 4 years ago. He developed a rare disease that the vet did not know much about. After spending every dime I had on experimental drugs, the vet told me it was time to put him down. I was by myself that day and couldnt bear to see him put down. I said my goodbye and left him there. I have regretted that decision to this day. I wish I would have stayed with him even though it would have been a lot to bear. I have never been able to stop thinking about him being alone. I cried for weeks, and the only thing that helped was getting a new puppy. I love my new dog so much, but I will always mourn the loss of my old buddy.  I'm sorry you hae to go through this. Its really hard.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	Biting lip as I recall holding my Dobermann Becca in my arms while she was put to sleep.    From the moment the breeder entrusted her to my care, until the moment I had to hold her in my arms while she was put to sleep because of DCM, she was my responsibility to care for, I did it gladly & I hope I lived up to my end of the bargain in her eyes.    It is undeniably hard for the humans, but very quick & peaceful for the dog.    Two of my much loved Dobermanns died in 2007, so I can appreciate how difficult this time must be for your family. However hard it is, in time the years spent together are the lasting memories.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	It is so hard- like pronouncing a death sentence on your child, but you know it's the right thing to do and so you do it.  It's not that bad- our vets and vet techs are awesome and they have helped me through two so far as well as the untimely death of another dog.  They let us say our goodbyes and hold them as they pass and they give me kleenexes while I bawl my eyes out.  I actually had one ask me if I was OK to drive after the first one!  Anyway, it's very difficult, but when it's the right time you know you have to do it for your friend.  I am sorry this is happening- it's one of the most unfortunate parts of being a pet owner.|`|vGtM2F5Caa	IM SORRY   that has never happened to mee but thats just sad|`|gXBPLitzaa	Well i got a great dane when i was 2 or 3 & had it untill i was about 10 or 11 & it was in really bad health so we had to put her down my mom didnt make me go to school because i wanted to be there & it was valentines day worst one ever! but i just laid with her until we had to go to the vets & we staid when they did it. I hated watching it but i wanted to be there & she actually died on me, I hated it & cried forever! & refused to leave her but i had to. It was sad but i just keep thinking about how much pain she had been in befor & thought that it was the best thing to do & eventually i was fine. But i still miss that dog & will never be able to forget that day.   Hope this helps.  Sorry about your dog. :(  Good luck!|`|RPTwjyjIaa	I had a cat once who started having seizures and went down hill very fast. He was loosing weight, his coat was dull, and he had a look in his eyes. We decided it was time to let him go. We stayed in the room with him and it was very peaceful. It was a lot quicker than I thought it was though so make sure you have your goodbyes said before they start the procedures. We still miss him but know we did the right thing. And do not worry about that being the picture that sticks in your mind because there are so many other happy memories that that last one will not outweigh them. I know it is a difficult decision and I am so sorry that this is happening. I know we would all like our animals to pass away peacefully in their sleep of old age, but sometimes this is just not possible. Sometimes we have to be strong for them. In time the pain will dull and you will be left with the happy memories.|`|VeDJa0m9aa	Just went thru the same options with our four-legged family member. We stayed with her at the vet's for awhile...alone. We praised her for what she meant to us all those years. But then we realized that the look she gave us weeks before this was a look of...'please, I'm hurting. Can you do anything for me?' Then the look she gave us that last day was one of forgiveness. It sounds odd, but that is what we interpretted. Then we left the room to let the vet do what needed to be done. The vet even fought back tears. That was months ago, and we still are not over it. We did store all her toys and dishes away knowing they will be used again once we find that 'other' special four-legged family member. Not sure if any of this helps. Just to let you know we know how you feel sadly for you. It almost makes you wonder what it would be like if we could do this to people that are dying and wish they could die in the same way.|`|iMOePEWlaa	i recomend staying with your animal. i study animal behavor and have owned many animals. my grandma and i had a dog that was 2 mounths younger than me(i lived with her for many years). his name was Flag,he was my best friend,when i was 14 his health started to rapedly decline,his back legs all the sudden stoped working. he was in pain,and i hated it.     we took him to the vet and he told us that Flag had an unusualy large heart and he was suprised that he had made it that long. the vet told us that there was nothign he could do for Flag exsept give him somethign to nubm the pain and then put him ut of his missory.    i refused to leave my bestfriends side,i grabed a chair and proped it up so i could crawl upon the table beside him(he was a corgy,and i am very pateet). i curled myself around him and sang to him as i did evrynight when we went to bed. he spent his last moments falling asleep in my arms as he did evrynight for as long as i cold remember.     while unbearibly sad,i feel i did the right thing. i am in my 20's now and i work in a non profit animal shelter while atending school studing animal behavor. i know many vets,and evry single on e of then says that when an animal is put down it is always easyer for the animal for the family to be there. so they dont have to be alone. many animals when alone will fight the affects of the drug they use to calm the animals and sometimes go into panic. while when there humans are there they are much more at ease and pase peacefully.    while i realize this is up to you and your family ,i recomend staying with your pet. he was there for you,be there for him. i am very sorry you are goig thrww this.|`|4ba573d10043e0b2f1d30e9ba0bb3383aa	I've never experienced this and I am not looking forward to it at all with my first dog however, I am a euthanasia technician and I can tell you that at any decent facility (you can also ask a local shelter to perform the procedure) you are the boss of this event. At the vet they may use an IV catheter before injecting the drug and this helps to ensure that the vein doesn't burst and that all the drug gets into the bloodstream successfully. It really is up to you if you want to be in the room with your dog or not. I've seen some not able to and just drop off the dog and some wouldn't dream of leaving their pet to be alone. It really depends on the type of person you are and there is no right or wrong answer to that. The procedure is quite painless and quick. It's like holding your dog as she just falls asleep in your arms but you should know that some, not all, pets will have a bowel movement at the very end and it is perfectly normal. You can have her favorite toy or blankie with her as well.  I am so sorry to hear you are going through such a tough time but things will be better for her if you feel she is suffering.  My thoughts are with you.|`|GHQyH4pMaa	It's really hard to deal with. I had a dog for 16 years that I had to put to sleep on May 9th, last year. It was really hard. I cried for days. She had had a stroke overnight and that morning she was dilirious, so I took her to the vet and she started having seizures. I didn't go watch them put her to sleep, because I had already seen enough of her suffer. So, they took her back and brought her back in a box and I peeked in before we buried her, which was horrible. It just took my breath away seeing her not respond to me. I suggest you put your dog to sleep before it gets too bad off and I don't suggest watching the procedure happen. I said I'd never get another dog, but 3 weeks later, I just happened to see an add for some puppies just like my old dog and I went and got one. She reminds me so much of my first dog, Katie. I made sure and put 2 of Katie's toys in her box, before we buried her. I wish I would have known and I would have ordered a nice dog casket for her, but it was out of nowhere, so all we had was the box and we went to PetSmart for a gravestone and buried her in my mom's backyard. Maybe you could get this stuff arranged and then do it. It will be hard, but you will get through it. The dog won't suffer in heaven.|`|usxaNpqoaa	YEs it is hard but it is best to be there with both your mum and dog and you can always remember all animals go to heaven no matter what i promise you =)  Good Luck and all the best|`|UlBryfIoaa	I think it is the most painful thing ever to watch your dogs last minutes slip away from their eyes. No matter how bad it hurts, it would be awful if you didn't spend those last few minutes of life with her. She gave you 12 years you owe it to her. And as for afterwords, bury her in a special place and place a picture of you and her in the grave. It hard but when I lost my dog I went and got a puppy the next day. You new dog will never replace your old dog but it will take your mind off of the hurt. Good luck and I am really sorry about your dog.|`|AA12109804	I'm so sorry, my dog is a german sheppherd and she's 11, she's aging fast too and I know her time is coming and I'm thinking the same thing as you.  I love her so much I won't be able to do it.  But I guess if it comes down to it, stay with your dog, let him or her know how much you love them.  Omg, I don't know, this is so hard.  I'm sorry I'm not much help but I just wanted to let you know that I know how you feel, and it's certainly not a good feeling at all.    After reading blue-eyed-girl's answer, my eyes started to water up.  Dog's are definitely your best rriend.  But I do think you need to be with your dog at that time.  Read this link, warning, it's very sad.|`|aHoeG6f5aa	Definately a horrible thing to go through.  Ours was a cat.  She was 15, and we had to put her down.  My family said bye to her at the house.  I was the only one who went to the animal hospital.  I went in the room with her while they put her down.  I had her since I could remember.  I wanted to be with her to the end.  I took her home and buried her.    Yes, it is horrible, but at the same time there is a sense of relief that you have taken your dog's pain away.  Everyone is different, but for me it was nice to see the peace on her face as she passed on.  It's not painful at all.  I cried A LOT.  We'd has her since I was 5, so I didn't remember life without her.  I still miss her, but the pain has gone away.  You will go through the grieving process.  But you will get through it.  Just remember you dog had a nice long life, and gave you lots of love.  Now, it's the most loving thing you can do for her to relieve her pain.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	My deepest sympathy. I have to say how proud it is to read how you handled this situation so far.I wouldn't recommend being in the room with the dog when they do it. You can however have your dog cremated and put in an urn to keep. There is also the option that you can put the dog in a pet cemetery. Having a plaque done is also something nice. I planted a tree in my yard in honour of my pet. I don't think its something you can ever get over. It will come in waves and hit you at moments you don't anticipate. Know that your dog lived a full wonderful life and you did try to save her will help with the pain. Talk about her, cry about her. Everyone needs to grieve. I know the feeling you are going through and it chokes me as I type. Some shelters have meetings dealing with bereavement for free and may have a pet mausoleum/garden. I would advise looking into it if its too hard to deal.|`|b6NhNXWMaa	Well, yes this is something that is very hard to deal with, and for me the pain has never completely gone away. But, it is something you do deal with and move on with your life. I just like to think of the good times with my dog. Our dog also had cancer, we had it removed and it gave us a few more years with her. One day she just wouldn't get up or eat or anything so as a family we decided to take her to the vet. They took her back without us and put the iv/needle thing in her arm, so we didn't see it happen and then we came in and all spent time in the room with her and said our goodbyes and my dad, myself and my little sister stayed with her while they put her to sleep. I held her as much as I could with her on the table while they did it. Then my dad paid the extra to have her cremated alone. We got her ashes and we decided to spread the ashes over the forest where she was born and grew up. I am still yet to do this but we kept a little of the ashes and I am going to have them put on a necklace somehow for my sister and myself. I am sharing my story with you because this is the best way possible I think that things could have gone with the situation. It still hurts to think about it but I know she is in puppy heaven running around with no pain in her hips or anywhere else. I also take comfort in the fact that I got to be there for her through it all and say a proper goodbye. It has been about 7 years and I still miss her but love to think about all the fun I had with her for 15 years growing up with her. =) I am sorry about your puppy and I wish you luck in figuring out what is the best thing for you and your family to do...|`|76nTvO4iaa	It's not horrible death for your dog - they go to sleep.    I hold my dogs while the vet gives them the shot.  I usually cry while I'm petting and kissing my dog and telling them how much I love them while they're going to sleep for the last time.  For me, to do it any other way would be abandoning my dog on their final journey.    I take the body with me and take it home so my remaining dogs know their buddy is gone.  After that, I take the dog to be cremated and keep the ashes on the mantle with a picture of the departed dog next to it.    Then I'm depressed and sad for a month or so over the loss of a precious, beloved pet.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	I have had to be responsible for attending a lot of endings, and it never gets easier. It is always a sad thing. Have two people go, so there is a driver who is not crying. I prefer to hold my animals head and talk to it. That way they are less frightened. Sometimes U can feel their spirit leave the body and sometimes U can not. My favorite way is to have the vet come out to the car, as it is less traumatic for the dog, but not many vets will do this. U have to have a good vet that U trust. The vet has to know that the dog in question will not bite.  The best way is to give two shots -- the first is a tranquilizer, the second the final does. It is a calm and peaceful way. The only bad thing is if the vet wants to shave a part of the front leg for finding a vein. That is kind of spooky for the dog. If U cut or trim the fur yourself at home or apply water to separate the fur, that is best.    I hope this helps U. Better a peaceful death than pain and suffering. Good luck. U have my sympathy.|`|FewhKlx9aa	I think this is one of the hardest decision to make as I have had to do it too many times..I have always stayed and held them till their last breath.It seems they are more comfortable and I think they know it's the end..I never get over it and think of it often as they are my babies and gave me so much..I also have them cremated to bring home with me.I also take a clipping of their hair and frame that with their picture and next to the pic is their favorite toy..If your dog is ready you willl know,less active ,can't get around,diarrhea,w/n eat or drink.I'm sorry it is so hard to know it's the end, just remember all the good times.It eases with time|`|vPde97E2aa	sigh............I've had to euthanize MANY dogs.    It's MY responsibility & I do *NOT* dump em off & leave .I hold them & speak to them.    It is NOT pleasant...it's a DUTY one accepts when dealing w/animals.!
5PsKGss7aa	that is a very sad story..  people are just so horrible.  It really sucks that they arent going to be caught..  its people like that who shouldnt even be allowed to be by dogs/cats/any animals....  Ive had a couple cases to of ungratefull bastards..  I rescued a dog that he was obviously dumped (we are sure he was dumped)there the night before (because we would have seen him the day before as we drive through that road a lot).. he was skinny, malnourished, wet from the rain a little earlier and was staying in a mongoose hole (we had to chase him down a bit and he went and tried to hide in the whole.  this is him the night we rescued him:  http://i146.photobucket.com/albums/r259/...  http://i146.photobucket.com/albums/r259/...    this is him now about 4 months later:  http://i146.photobucket.com/albums/r259/...  http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...  http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...  He has a crooked tooth,he has bowed legs (no way to fix that)& he has a limp from an old break that didnt heal right..he doesnt like car rides too much(we think its because he thinks we are going to dump him), and when we lift things up a certain way and he's around, he jumps away like we are going to hurt him or something (but he's gotten to a point now that he jumps a little and doesnt run away,so he's gotten better from that).    Another case just happened this past halloween, this small dog  http://s146.photobucket.com/albums/r259/...  was walking along this family of trick or treaters, obviously scared, and one of the bigger guys just turned around and kicked him, i just gasped, my mom went up and said "What the f***!", the guy just looked at her as she was grabbing up the dog, and my mom gave him stink eye and he just turned around back to the group(that had children). But then its strange, we held him overnight, no one claimed him, but my aunt said she was 90% sure that the house she showed us after is wehere the dog came from, and wouldnt you know it, the dumba** guy was in the garage..  so after we gave Buddy(thats his name now) to HS, we adopted him after there was no owner that came forward(we knew who he was though but we had no proof of the matter so didnt say anything) & after he got neutred there..  He was  not that social but we have been working with him that he now accepts all his new doggy brothers & sisters and kitty brothers & sisters lol..  and its obvious that he has been abused, but we are slowing working through that..  him now:  http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...  http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...|`|AyOM41obaa	thats just sick....|`|msAh2tItaa	i totally agree a few years ago a friend of mine almost ran over 4 tiny 4 week old kittens in the middle of the road thankfully he stopped at the last minute and ended up taking them all home with him only 2 survived but at least they didnt all die. i cant understand how people can be so mean to a poor defenceless animal its like people who dump animals. why they could just take them and leave them at the local pound at least they would get fed and watered and have a small chance at getting adopted its far better than a straight death sentence and if they do end up getting put down it will be humanely not starving to death or getting hit by a car. i dont like kill shelters but they are a better alternative to being thrown out like garbage. i hate it when ppl just dump animals on the side of the road i have gotten several good animals due to those people that would have been easily adoptable in shelters or easily given away to a good home where people would take care of them. right now i have a friend who just took in 3 dachounds one of which was pregnant  and had 3 puppies shortly after she got them that someone dumped near where she works. they are all purebred and could have easily been found good homes i cant understand why the person who dumped them would not try to find them homes. I guess they are just lazy and figure they can just take them while they are out and drop them on some corner and someone will take them in but putting them in a bag is just plain cruel i would have your friend call the police and see if they can get prints off the bag they were in so the person who did that can be prosecuted|`|PM23RDycaa	The same way they used to dump puppies and kittens in bags and in the rivers.. They just don't care and are too lazy to get their animals fixed.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	AWFUL!!!    I rescued my "Amber" from a cardboard box.

About a month ago I drove up to a house to get some information. the house was for sale. When I drove to the back of the house, there was a small dog tied to a tree with no food or water. That night it was cold and raining. I sent my sons to the house and told them if lights were on, to come home. But if there were no lights on, bring the little dog home with them. They brought him home. He was so obviously malnourished. The next morning I called my vet to see if they could see him. They told me I would have to call animal control. That is what I did. For three days they tried to find the owner. They never did. After ten days, I adopted him. He will never have to spend a night out in the cold again. If I were a judge, I would throw people like that and the ones that put puppies on the highway, under the jail|`|9Y56hQRlaa	How dare they!!! (i'm a member to the ASPCA!!!)

I agree, it is absolutely heartbreaking that someone thought that this was the best solution for being rid of a "problem". Horrific comes to mind. Not to justify what they did, but what would have happened if they took them to the humane society? Would they have been euthanized? Who knows? My first reaction was to shoot them or throw a rope over a tree branch and lynch them.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	I don't know, but this sort of thing happens too often.

I have 2 rescue dogs that were dumped.  Unfortunately, the people who dumped them also threw out their collars with tags attached.  When we researched them, we found out they were adopted from a local animal shelter as puppies and then when they became older and harder to manage, they carried them to the country and left them.  However, they are now with me after a very crappy letter to the adoptees regarding the treatment of the animals they supposedly "saved."|`|gXBPLitzaa	Thats terrible those kinds of ppl make me sick.  I mean if you really dont want them you can do something else with them other then that! Thats terrible. If i knew the person who did that i would deff have to give a good punch!

Kinda like when ppl tourture animals or how kids hurt cats on hallowen. ppl are just heartless & sick.|`|YLYAo2zmaa	I found 3 lab mix puppies in a box on the side of a back road in the August heat several years ago, there was a coffee can of kibble in with them but no water, they were horribly dehydrated and starved, I mean their tongues were starting to curl up, and every bone in their bodies showed. I lost the little male that night and the girls turned out to be so beautiful and loving. I rehomed them after several months of rehab to an animal services officer in another state. They are doing wonderfully and are "example" dogs. I was offered a job at that shelter because of their success. It is a happy ending to an awful crime.|`|eDySIDPQaa	People with no heart does these kind of things, and I wish they would get caught...it happens too often.....the poor little babies.....

Biggest rip off I've seen besides the so called Allergenic cats or Ashera cats.
C1eHfhrHaa	nope 11 weeks is a great age to get a puppy.  he will be hyper- they are both dogs that are bred to walk all day in the field, so the pup will need plenty of exercise, obedience training, and you will want to crate train it because labs are notorious for being chewers and destroyers of furniture and shoes.  It sounds like a great pup.  Good luck!|`|zSOnXtiQaa	8 weeks is the youngest you can/should adopt a puppy but 11 weeks is a good age. Have you observed the litter? Each dog will have its own personality and temperament but both breeds are general friendly, happy and silly.|`|NKRJQLIXaa	labs and goldens are very a like in temperament. both can be overly friendly/excited around people but generally, great dogs! get a ball ready (retrievers).|`|nGjMvGYqaa	Generally, lab/retrievers have wonderful, friendly, happy personalities. They are excellent dogs. But, dogs really depend on their owners. A dog is only as good as his owner trains him to be. 11 weeks is a good age to adopt at. You will need to begin training immediately. Adopting is a good thing. You are most likely saving one of these pups' lives. Labs and retrievers are known for having great personalities- they are really great family pets. Good luck!|`|hhWDHmfyaa	We have one.  This is the world's greatest breed - when they are 24 months old and you understand the value of exercise.  You have quite a lot of work and energy on your hands and need quite a budget for chew toys and training now.    From the golden - you get an absolute devotion to children.  From the lab - you get an absolute focus on 'chase the ball/swim for the ball'.  The combination is pure heart covered with fur.    At this age, training is critical.  Now, and even more so as they grow, it is important to understand the direct tie between those amazing and awesome lab/golden personalities and daily RUNNING exercise.  This lot will ony turn into a behavior problem with a quick potty walk twice a day.  They can live in a small apartment as they like to snuggle and sleep - but they do need a solid hour a day of strenous exercise.    Good luckand enjoy the devotion and humor they will bring to your lives.|`|n8jrLDblaa	11 weeks is not too young to purchase a pup.    As far as temperament goes, that is determined by genetics. The fact that the dog is a mixed breed means it can favor either size standard-wise, so best to research both standards and assume the dog posesses the best and worst qualities of both breeds.
xxSGhywoaa	I was once told by a person that they refuse to go into a shelter because it's like buying from goodwill!    I've never in my life felt so much rage and hatred.|`|PM23RDycaa	Adopting is not for everyone - pure and simple truth.    REPUTABLE breeders are not part of the problem. They take their animal back for the entirety of their lives. They work with their breed rescues. They don't breed without a FULL waiting list    Irresponsible owners, Abusive owners, impulsive buyers, puppymills who get raided and then flood the shelters rescues and fosters with THOUSANDS of dogs and bybs however ARE the problem.    ADD: I can also count on both hands how many people I know who wanted to adopt FIRST off but got so fed up with the hoops some of these well meaning shelters and rescue put them through that they went to breeders instead.    Sometimes they set themselves up to fail by not taking things on a case by case basis rather than sticking to a strict and inflexible set of requirements.|`|vPde97E2aa	NO,THEY ARE *NOT*!!!    *I* don't want a pound-hound.  The people who want my top-quality dogs don't.  *I* didn't make those mutts.  *I* didn't DUMP em!  *I* am NOT responsible.    MY dogs are my EDUCATED *CHOICE*!  Do NOT tell me what to buy or breed.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	They are not what I need in a dog.    And anyways, the problem is not too many puppies, it's too many people who buy dogs without committing to them, and dump them in the pound when they're "too much trouble".|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	Rather than have a go at the decent people who responsibly and ethically breed dogs and those who buy dogs from these responsible and ethical breeders why don't you put your efforts into those people who breed cross-breds, designer breeds and low quality purebreds with potentieal health issues.  As well as those who buy these cross breeds, designer breeds and low quality purebreds and then dump then because they are too big, too small, sick, poorly trained with behavioural issues, etc, etc.    Responsible breeders and owners did not cause the problem of unwanted dogs being dumped in animal shelters so why should we be victimised as a result.     Put the blame squarely where it belongs and take action against those low lifes.    Also, to answer your question.  Most shelter dogs do not suit my needs.|`|2l7lbcJWaa	No they're not. Thats why they're in the pound. hahaha    I'm just kidding I just wanted to see how many thumbs downs i could get from all the shelter fanatics. I have a pitbull/mix from a shelter and she's the best dog I've ever had|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Not if you like to show in conformation and are looking for an excellent dog of a specific breed.  I have both- dogs and cats that have been adopted and pure bred dogs.  I love them all equally, but I can't wait to have the b**** that has it all- conformation, temperament, and health, and to bring more DDBs into the world that have those qualities to be owned by people who are knowledgeable about the breed and who love to show and compete with them.  You won't get me to say that responsible breeding is bad.  Puppymillers, BYBs, absolutely, but there is a place for responsible breeding.|`|Gnhgfx4naa	Ive made myself a goal in life and that is "When I have enough money to take good care of them then for sure I'm adopting a dog!" I hate the fact that they die for no reason as well. It truly sucks.|`|iXijnCxOaa	Because I cannot find what I need in a dog from a shelter.  Because I do not want to buy someone else's problem dog when I can start with a dog with no ingrained issues.  Because I do not want to deal with the health or temperment issues getting a dog from ANYWHERE but a responsible breeder can result in.  Because my TIME is worth money and wasting my time on a dog who develops a health issue and is then unable to work (resulting in someone who doesn't have the working dog they need to assist them) is cost prohibitive.  Because *I* didn't create the issue.    I've rescued far more dogs than I will ever produce ~ I have no issues with shelter/rescue dogs WHEN they suit the purpose.  I require well-bred, guaranteed dogs for the work I do.    Edit: My email is open.  Anyone desiring to have a conversation with me is perfectly welcome to email me.  Or, alternately, they can ASK their own question and invite me via email to answer it - realizing that I do not have access at all times... but will answer in the evening when I've seen my personal email.|`|KoaNr1x5aa	Because some of us want purebreds, with the bloodlines that make the breed the best it can be and generally you wont find them at the pound, now dont get me wrong pound puppies deserve a good life as well but I myself want purebreds|`|cd731a89d8c493e5a2e82406e38dcdb2aa	For the first part of your question.... when I get a dog, I want to know the lineage, health and longevity behind what I am considering.     As for the 2nd part of your question...  Obviously the breeder that produced them are the ones that are not good enough. If they'd take back pups or dogs that they are responsible for there wouldn't be a problem. Someone looking for a spayed/neutered companion dog, yes, rescues & shelters are a good place to start.|`|VaYjl71Laa	Reputable breeders keep breeds going strong (something they desperately need with all the moron "breeders" who ask questions on here).  BYB's are worthless creatures who deserve to suffer through months and months of physical and mental pain.      Actually pound dogs are very desirable.  My breeder has 14 dogs, 10 gsd's and 4 shelter dogs.|`|sMBuotwZaa	I have been on Both sides of the fence with this. My fiance and I have 3 dogs.  1 who is a rescue and 2 who are purebreds from Responsible breeders.    While I love my mutt, I can tell you that she will probably be our last rescue dog (with the exception of maybe a breed specific rescue).    She is a sweet dog, she is best described as a Boxer/Greyhound/Lab mix.  While she is nice, and gentle...she is also unpredictable. Her temperament has changed a lot since we have gotten her (part of it was Rehab from being beaten as a small pup), and we don't know how that will develop as she ages.  Also she is a large dog, so has the potential for problems such as Bloat and hip displaysia.  We have know way of knowing how her hips and elbows are going to age. So thats a crap shoot.  We love her, but worry about what her future could hold.    Our other 2 dogs come from reputable breeders, who test their breeders for genetic defects before breeding them, as well as breed for temperament.  We know our dachshund doesn't have any history of Epilepsy, or back defects in his bloodline. He was bred away from those traits.  We also know that with our aussie, both parents had exceptional Temperaments, and both parents had Excellent hip and elbow scores, so his chances of being structurally sound are much better.  There is a peace of mind knowing that.    Also... the drives, and personalities of our purebreds better suit our needs, and what we are active in.      We would NEVER get rid of our mutt, we love her far to much and she really is a great dog.  But we will be more choosy next time.    Its not that shelter dogs aren't good enough, thats not always the case.  Its just that people want more of an understanding of what they are going to get when they get a dog, and in that case a Well bred purebred is the way to go.    There are people out there who are suited to rescue shelter dogs, and give them the perfect life and homes, and bless those people for doing that.  Because I know from experience (one I would never change) that this isn't the case for everyone.|`|AyOM41obaa	ur right and never buy from petsmart look y..      http://www.petsmartcruelty.com/|`|PbESvbu6aa	You asked the perfect question. People should be doing what I did this morning my girl scout troop donated blankets and towels to a non kill animal rescue, cat food and dog food and other items they needed it and we need to support non kill animals rescues.|`|RKOzbNLdaa	It depends on the dog, some of them are in the pound because there owners didnt want them or the couldn't keep them. While other dogs are there because they needed some jail time LOL. So I think most of the time dogs from the dog pound are just fine, but people don't adopt them because they want puppies or pure breeds.|`|NKRJQLIXaa	Some people want a dog as a puppy, so they wont be worry about their past and raise them up to be the way they want. Or just the fact that puppies are cute.    A lot of the dogs are at the shelter because they cause a problem(s) to the past owner.. Problems can be minor and easily  be fixed/worked with. Some are harder like aggression, biting, excessive barking.    Although, some dogs are just there because of the simple fact that someone decided they dont want a dog anymore, cant afford them (lost job, huge vet bill, etc.), lost their homes and moved to a place that cant have dogs, or someone lost their dog and didnt do a good job searching for them.    There are plenty of young puppies at the shelter. What do people/breeders do when they breed puppies that doesnt sell? You guess!!! I didnt get one from the shelter because its a big pain in the *** for me. Got to show permission from landlord, got to have everyone in the household come to look at dog, house screening,  going back and forth with the risk of the dog you want getting adopted already, etc.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	as someone who has an adopted dog as well as breeder dogs i don't think that phrase is fair. every dog needs love but a shelter dog is not for everyone just like a dog is not for everyone. yes it's great to save a life. it gives them a second chance and makes you feel good about yourself but there are a lot more factors that come into it vs getting a 'fresh face cute cuddly puppy'. most people view puppies as cute clean slates. shelter dogs come with their own baggage and some shake it off quicker and easier than others. it requires a different kind of patience than just a regular dog.     it's up to a person to make up their own mind about it. would i encourage someone who just wants a companion to look into a shelter dog if for no other reason than to see what's out there, you bet. but would i hound them about it. no that's their choice.     many people reference it to demanding you not have your own children but you adopt so there are no longer any homeless children. granted homeless children aren't put to sleep but that's how many people feel about being hounded about going to a shelter.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Most of the time people don't realize that dogs at shelters are just as good, if not better, than dogs from breeders or anywhere else.  They also don't realize the fate of most pet store puppies is the pound, shelters, etc once people tire of them.  They also don't think you can get a purebred at a shelter or rescue.
9NDL5YQJaa	Good luck.  My brother's small dog(Snoodle) has come to my place and my cat and her didn't get along to well.  The dog was curious, cat wanted to defend his established territory.  But, we did try a process we saw on the internet and when I watched the dog a couple days they seemed to be more tolerant after we tried it.    Step 1- put the cat in a cat carrier or dog carrier case and place near the center of a room.    Step 2- Make sure the dog is in a calm state.  Bring the dog close to the cage.  Then let the dog sniff the cat on their own terms.      Step 3- Next, calm the dog down, put the dog in the cage and let the cat sniff the dog on his own terms.    After that, my cat and brother's dog were at least more tolerant of eachother.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	attacks for no reason? goes for the eyes?  no offense, but, DUH!    a dog being in her house, is the reason for her attack. they go for the eyes, and nose, on a frontal attack, because the dog leads with his nose. fangs and claws are used when they jump on the back, because the dog cant reach them.    other then separating for a few weeks, then introduce slowly, i dont know what you can do.    look at the bright side, im sure the guy is a loser that is sleeping with your best friend right now, and as soon as you find out, you will leave anyway.|`|bNOj7Up9aa	Feliway will not work on dogs.  Did you move into his apartment? The cat may think of it as her territory if so. She is also probably scared out of her mind.  You can give her time to cool down, maybe keep them separate for a while.  It jsut takes time and patience.  Clip her nails too.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Your dogs are NOT in danger... she is just teaching them who the ALFA is in the house.  You need to support her... don't allow your dogs that hyper dashing around...this would also scare a child.  If your apt is small possibly getting a house with a yard would be better.  Feliway doesn't work with a dog.  Let the animals work it out...
1888bff8ef07d4859fd7c43b635cd7f4aa	Sure, I do it often.|`|AA10625395	Of course you can and really you should.    Adopting a cat is a big step.  You want to know a lot about these wonderful pets and what better way?  Maybe in visiting, you will find the exact feline friend you want, and then you will be glad you looked around .    Remember that adopting a cat means that you keep him or her for the rest of their life.  The cat will love you and become family to you, so make a lifetime commityment to your new pet, because that is what they do.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	That's a very good idea - and you can fill out an adoption application while you are there.  Very few shelters do "on the spot" adoptions anyway.  By having your adoption application all approved and ready to go, you'll be able to go and pick out your cat when you are ready.|`|jxIYuFBXaa	of course you can!|`|spbqfjvbaa	Yes.  The cats will love it.  Make sure you tell the shelter workers you're not there to adopt, just to look around.    Even better, why don't you volunteer at a shelter?  That way, you get to browse & play with cats, plus you're helping out, too!|`|AA10859773	Don't forget that you can probably also surf "kitty porn" online!    For example:  http://www.wihumane.org/animals/cats.asp...    Find the sites for your local shelters and have fun browsing!|`|I5pUxwPbaa	definately, they want to make sure each person is capable of caring for the animals so they won't pressure you to adopt if you are not ready|`|ab682b6840784d29891281987e3e32b2aa	Yeah some places allow you to. Some places are more strict on who they let into the shelter (as in you have to be interested).     I good idea would be to volunteer there until you're ready. That will give you an awesome idea of what cat you might like.|`|kycCzUVGaa	Of course you can but prepare to have your heart ripped out. Better to find places where cat loving people are taking care of strays. They are all over the place. I am one of them. I will get you a cat already spayed/neutered shots and if you ever want or have to abandon it I will take it back. You won't get that deal from a shelter.|`|Au4gWgEiaa	There's no problem with that!  Don't be surprised if you walk out with a new furry friend though!!|`|eM0K2ejwaa	I would first decide what breed you want first. Even though all cats are cool some cats are not for everyone. take a look at these:  http://www.listsergeant.com/blog/top-10-...
6qAq5LrUaa	my lab hated hard wood floors so we lined them with small carpets like a trail then started taken out every other one so he had to walk on the floor a little after a whilt we took them all up and he leared the floor wasnt going to kill him and then he was fine...good luck!!|`|gdvCvWrLaa	I have a white English and mine does the same thing.  they do this because dogs like to be in control and they can't be when they are slipping and sliding. I would suggest putting rugs down in your home. This helps with my dog.|`|iVQULHqYaa	Wooden floors are hygienic unfortunately lots of dogs are worried about walking on slippery floors. When your two year old gets older, he too will have a problem. Get some cheap carpets runners which your youngest dog will walk on. Both of the dogs will prefer this.|`|yhgRaBPXaa	I saw that on the dog whisperer. The dog had slipped on the new floor and hurt himself. Ceasar just kept walking the dog over and over again on the floor til he became confident|`|8a388a5ebde8e1afd4da3560460f83a8aa	"He slides and stumbles"  thats your answer. not sure how you can fix that... put runners down?|`|H3J6bN0Yaa	He'll feel very vulnerable on that type of floor and he might have slipped and frightened himself which will put him off. Wood floors aren't ideal for dogs to walk on as they are always slipping and can injure themselves. You might have to run a rug through the middle of the room.
p3OIPNNKaa	Your local animal shelters may have one.  I assume you are looking for a wein/lab mix because the AKC only recognizes yellow, black and chocolate.  Therefore the only way you can have a grey/charcoAl lab is if one had Genetic Drift per the Theory of Evolution.  This would be a genetic mutation in which the chromosome for color changed to grey/charcoal.  But since you live in the bible belt, evolution doesn't exist so the above doesn't apply to you.  Perhaps buying a yellow lab and alot of hair coloring may work.|`|ti8L5zryaa	They will not be Labs, but a cross, so save your money  and check with shelters. Only unethical people will deliberately breed crossbreeds and then charge a large amount of money for them.|`|Chxoncy7aa	Labs come in Black, Chocolate and yellow.|`|AA10029366	Unethical crooks breed "silver" Labs.

Any breeder that has that color, does not  breed purebred labs, and that would make them BYB's.      Poster- I think you are missing the point- there are NO BREEDERS of silver labs.  ONLY BYB's and Millers.    If you want a good purebred lab check out www.akc.org  It will tell you what a good lab is, and will give you direction to find a breeder in Houston area.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Well, the AKC only recognizes 3 colors and they are black, chocolate, and yellow.

RloOJ43haa	Dropping feed while eating can be a sign that there is a tooth problem, but it is not always a sign that there is a tooth problem. You did the right thing getting the dentist to look, and if she says his teeth are fine then they probably are. Some horses are just pigs!|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	It is probably just that he is in a hurry to eat. One of my horses is a very messy eater and she has the dentist regularly and there is nothing wrong with her teeth! P.S.

They are messy eaters and I just can't seem to teach them to chew with their mouths closed. So rude. JK. I think most horses drop food out while their chewing.

wF52XMxAaa	Blacket is a section of Edinburgh.  Putting it over a hamers cage - whatever kind of bird a hamer is - would probably cause the people there to panic rather than fall asleep.    Hamsters, on the other hand, are nocturnal, so they're more likely to sleep in daylight than in the dark.
25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	as long as they are not stuck in one room, they move to where ever it is cooler.  put a table next to a window so they can lie in the breeze, if you have cement floor under carpet, pull up a section so they can sleep on the cement. a garage or basement is perfect.  you can try a fan, but it cant be close.  and lots of fresh clean water.|`|VMY7No0eaa	MAKE SURE TO HAVE THEM spayed and neutered so they won't have kittens.  and then just make sure they have water at all times and food.
LkdZPgvjaa	You should never "grab" a bird.  This will instill a fear of human hands in the bird.  You might have read a book about training birds and saved you and your bird a lot of time and trouble as it looks as if you will have to undo what you've already done by "grabbing".  What you want is for the bird to come to you, to want to be with you, and will step on your finger because the bird knows you are it's leader and it will do what the leader says.  You need to communicate this to the bird - this is what is known as 'training'.  First off, clip the bird's wings so that he can still land but not gain any altitude.  Secondly, you and the bird need to start trusting - sit with him, talk to him, let him know you love him but what ever you do - do not grab him anymore.  This is going to take a long time to get his trust back. Sit with him in a small room - like a bathroom, talk to him, give him a chance to see your index finger and your hand without it closing in on him. When you get to the point to where he will let you put your finger near his feet, close to his lower front, gently press your finger to just above his feet and say 'Step up'.  You might add "Please" as you want him to come to you but you don't want to give him orders, just a request and adding "Please" will also change your own attitude.  You get what you give.  Show him some respect and he might do the same to you.|`|OWXI806qaa	What she said.  It worked with my parakeet.|`|dO0cb4yBaa	Check into clicker training. You can find a lot of information on Google. Just search for "Clicker Training Birds". It's easy to learn, it works very well and is used by a lot of professional animal trainers. Check out the sources below for a list of Clicker Training articles, Clicker Training books and Clicker Training Links|`|x7tsarblaa	Have patience. I think by getting your bird used to transitioning from her perch to a perch on your hand will slowly transition her in being removed from her cage. In other words, this removable perch will serve as an extension of your hand. Each time say step up and gently place the perch a little below its chest to signal for your bird to grab hold of the perch. Do this once a day and then graduate to a couple of times a day, then slowly remove the perch and try your hand, if the bird refuses continue with the perch until your bird feels comfortable. I did this with my cockatiel and it worked wonders. It took about a week, until my bird would voluntarily step up on my hand. But then again, some birds get adjusted easier than others, so just have patience. good luck.|`|xR5mCcD8aa	When your parakeet is calm and out of her cage take a handful of seed.Sit there until she comes on to your hand do that several times and eventually she will get used to it, Once she gets use to it you can start petting her on the head very gently.when she is back in the cage you put your hand in very slowly and start rubbing her belly and say step up. Once you do that she has three choices fall back(she will try to avoid that), fly away, or step up. do that several times daily. eventually she will get the hang of it.
bseGACNXaa	I've never had husky, but I know they can be quite a handful.  The Dog Whisperer has a lot of good ideas on how to get dogs with issues to turn into wonderful pets.  I have also seen the neighbors use the face halter on dogs that turns their heads when they try to pull them while going for a walk.      You probably need to read a book on Huskies.  There may be a reason why you always see them tied up individually and not just together in a kennel like hounds.  They might like to run off and fight.  I'm certain that you will have to constantly show that you are pack leader or your Husky will try to take over.|`|d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	The animal shelter where you adopted the dog may have free training.

If you don't know how, there are books and videos. All you need is you, your dog and a leash. Coming is easy by calling and offering a small treat. Most of the commands can be reinforced with praise when she gets it right and a treat. Ignore her mistakes. Negative reinforcement doesn't work.|`|zSOnXtiQaa	There are all kinds of great training websites. Just google the command you are trying to conquer and you will find tons of helpful info.

Not that it is impossible but it would take a lot more effort. Take small steps and reward and praise all appropriate behaviors. If you need help, find a professional trainer in your area.    One caveat: Do NOT rush this. You do not want to confuse/traumatize any dog let alone one that has been neglected for so long.    As far as other dogs goes, try introducing her to male, neutered dogs slowly, while rewarding acceptable behaviors. You might find it better that she not interact with other dogs. Every dog is different, and hopefully you can still make something of this one.|`|PDx6wlPQaa	Hi, this may sound naff but have you ever watched dog whisperer Cesar Milan?

C1eHfhrHaa	Some dogs aren't fully housebroken until one year old.  COnfine her to the room you are in, so if you see her about to eliminate you can stop her. Other than that, I am not sure. It might be related to UTIs, but if she can hold it in her crate, it doesn't make sense that she would pee that often on the carpet.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Corgis are adorable, but can be stubborn. The crate is good, but some dogs will mess in their crates. Since U R spending so much time taking her out (which is good) U need to train her to potty on command. This scan only be done on a leash properly. It won't take long with treats. Once they start peeing in the house it is hard to break them of this because they go by smell so much. Cleaning where she has had accidents is important.   The urinary tract infections were a set back. I cook for our dogs daily because i am not sure I trust commercial dog food formulas. Besides the big dog food companies kill a lot of dogs to test their formulas. Yuck.  U ask how come she waits so long in the crate? Because dogs do not want to soil the den or nest. As soon as she is out of the crate she feels that it is OK to relive herself. Be patient -- U R doing most of the correct things. Just need more potty training outside with verbal cues and praise.  Oatmeal, rice and millet are all good bases for dog food, and then U add your own cooked veggies, vitamins, seaweeds, oils.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Sounds like bad behavior and she needs to go out right away as soon as you open her crate and get a leash on her before she has a chance to start running around the house..If she holds it all night and does'nt mess the crate then she just needs to be retrained..Scolding her won't work but as soon as you catch her pick her up and get her outside to finish..She'll catch on|`|AA12322387	Assuming the UTI is gone, be sure to clean your floor to get the smell out.  Many times animals will continue to go in places if they can still smell it.
wXh4QpaYaa	Yeah, that's not good. He is showing aggressive behavior because something is making him uncomfortable.    Honestly, I'm not sure what to do about this, other than get an experienced trainer. Our Bostons don't do this. Since we've had them, I think that I have heard them bark three times.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	U do not say how old? This is not really acceptable behavior in any pet. U need to go to dog school and read some books. I like Cesar Milan's books and tapes/CD|`|vPde97E2aa	"NORMAL"???   Sure,for ANY dog owned by the weak & brainless who refuse to TRAIN /DISCIPLINE their spoiled rotten beasts!|`|ktdpOM8Maa	It sounds like he's trying to exhibit fear. Typically rolling on his back would display submission, but because he's growling, he's telling you to back off, because he's afraid.     You should try to praise him with a small treat every time he allows you to pet him without growling, and ignore him if you go to touch him and he growls. He'll get the message very soon that you won't tolerate his bad attitude, and you mean him no harm.|`|iMOePEWlaa	breed has nothing to do with it,it is part of his personality. but as long as he is not biting or lunging at someone he is not a danger.   some dogs just growl for the hell of it. my shelty growls and wags his tail at the same time. he also douse this other sound,while it sounds very much like a growl to most people,my family and Those who are around him alot can tell the difference,we call it "humming" or "hrumphing".   he may just be telling you he doesn't want to be pet at that moment,maby he gets grumpy.    there is however another reason this could be,if he dous it more often at a particular aira of his body it is possible that he has an enlarged organ or some sort of tumor. keep an eye on him,i hope this is not the case but it is possible.    i wish you the best of luck and i hope i have been helpfull|`|Cr0TWTSLaa	sounds like he needs a spanking...      just kidding. contact petsmart trainers and let them train your dog for  you. thats what i did to my dog.|`|nGjMvGYqaa	No, this really is not acceptable behavior. Sometimes when dogs are in pain they growl. Perhaps you should take him to the vet. He may have something like a toothache or arthritis. If you take him to the vet and nothing is wrong you will want to begin some behavior modification training. Ask your vet for more advice on this subject.|`|vtYRw2yWaa	A Boston Terrier's a tiny dog, and plenty of small dogs are scared of new people if only because it's intimidating. If they're scared, it makes sense to react that way. Try sitting down, staying closer to his level.    http://www.sweetsearch.com/search.html?q...|`|H3J6bN0Yaa	Seek professional advice as this problem could escalate if not handled correctly. It sounds as though he is rolling over in submission and then warning you to leave him alone. It's important if he is signalling to you to leave him alone, that you do that otherwise he may have to indicate even more obviously that he is unhappy and bite.  Once a dog bites in these circumstances it is hard to teach them not to once it becomes a successful strategy for them. You need to be shown in a practical way how to handle this. Don't use punishment - it might make you feel better but he will feel worse. When he rolls over on his back this isn't an invitation to stroke him otherwise he wouldn't growl or show his teeth.  He is showing normal dog behaviour (unacceptable to humans) which you must learn to read better otherwise it won't improve and it will get worse. Another dog would read his signals and back off when he displayed this behaviour. Please don't let anyone tell you he is dominant and to punish this dog.  A vet could tell you if he has a mental problem.|`|ti8L5zryaa	This is not normal for any breed.  It looks like your Boston is taking over and trying to be the boss.  Hopefully you will not let him do this, or you will have a dangerous dog and a potential liability.  Contact your vet for a checkup and then get him into obedience school and follow their advice.  I would never accept this behavior.
wF52XMxAaa	It's PTFE non-stick coatings that are so terribly toxic to birds (and people, too - just not as much).  In theory, silicone is safe.  It's a polymerized siloxane - a long-chain molecule with a repeating Si-O backbone.  Even if it melts, it won't give off fumes.  But there are other groups attached to the silicons in the chain, and some of these can be toxic when heated.  In practice, it depends what the manufacturer mixes in.  At this point, many people say their silicone bakeware stinks when they heat it - and those fumes are harmful to birds (and people).  If it doesn't stink, it's probably fine.  How you can tell which are which without trying them is beyond me, so I don't have any.  I'll wait for them to work the bugs (or fumes) out.|`|IxuMTGd4aa	Hi    No, it is not. The fumes (when cooking) have toxins in them, that when your birds inhale it, they get poisoned and in most cases, if not treated quickly and expertly, kills the bird.
25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	sure, but the dog might eat him.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Depends upon the dog and the dog's owner. If it is used to meeting kittens then ok, it will only smell and perhaps lick the kitten. Other than that I'd say proceed with great caution.|`|0I9Fm00Naa	yes he can , he is going to be quite curious at first but once he gets to know the kitten he will except it as part of the family, It's also easier to introduce a kitten or a puppy to an older animal, Animal instinct has a tendency to be able to tell when the other animal is in the infant stage. The same goes for an older cat being introduced to a puppy , They will grow up being best of friends.|`|ilaAcjGvaa	under constant supervision at first, yes.  this also depends on your dogs personality.  my dog was a very friendly yellow lab and loved the cat at first sight. it was the cat who had to get used to my doggy :)|`|YdJgrgvdaa	of course, as long as your dog is used to cats it should all be fine. My dog has grown up with cats, and whenever we get a new cat he always meets them nearly straight away, he sometimes is a bit boisterous but the cat will put the dog in his place.   Good luck.|`|cyAJvGQcaa	yes if the dog is calm but you will have to keep an eye on them for a bit.|`|AA12322387	A very calm dog that is used to cats with constant supervision, yes.|`|8OoKYHN7aa	i do not think you should let your 8 week old kitten meet a dog because i think she/he would be to young, my cat was about a year or a year and a half when i got my dog and he was not happy at frist but he was ok after a while. So wait till your cat is a little old  P.S I hope it all works out for you and your new kitten|`|UlBryfIoaa	I got an 8 week old kitten last year and we already had 3 rat terrier dogs. Now the cat thinks he is a dog. When he was a baby he would chase after and wrestle with the dogs, and still does it. If you are going to have dogs around your cat, do it young. Otherwise they will fear them as they get older. Good luck!|`|3fQ1eIMqaa	it depends about the dog, but when my cats had kittens  they met my dog as soon as they were able to walk and there all fine now x x|`|jDuSXZETaa	yes you can.i have 2 dogs and we got a kitten and introduced them.the kitten may be funny at 1st but will get used to it eventually.my cat now cuddles up to both my dogs.
Da69ulcraa	UGH UGH UGH! That's just what we need! Designer dogs, my cousin has a "teacup" yorkie x Chihuahua, the poor thing weighs not even two pounds at 2 1/2 yrs! It's disgusting! DAMN YOU BACKYARD BREEDERS!!!!!!!!!!|`|gwUMipsUaa	Back Yard Breeders and Puppy Mills unite!    Probably the only good thing...barf...is they say this.."Not recognized as a purebred, Tinkerbulls combine many of the bulls into one dog.".    They admit it's not a purebred.|`|PM23RDycaa	*takes a drink*    And as for how I feel about designer dogs    Unless they are made by prada, gucci, versaci or helmut lang they are NOT designer anythings. Mutts and runts that's it|`|Chxoncy7aa	What is wrong with people....|`|0SHAY9TQaa	I need a barf bag too..........ahhhhhh    I HATE breeders, who breed 'designer dogs.' And, I mean it, I hate them.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Are U asking about Miniature American Bull Terriers? They have been around a looooong time. How long did U think it would take before they got crossed with whatever?  People have gone nuts with cross breeding and designer breeding. I guess these humans are bored with life. Too bad they can't channel their energy into recycling or something.   Maybe U could join a local humane society and work on educational programs for school kids, That's where to start -- the adults are a lost cause.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Dang you Kayla, now I have to figure out how to clean the keypad. This crap isn't' going away is it?     This is one Pit that should be banned    I'm just waiting for a teaweiller.    Addition: MNM1088 did you really have to show a mini Rottie, Life as I know it will never be the same I am going to cry|`|C1eHfhrHaa	I threw up a little in my mouth.  WTF?|`|afPzgCSHaa	wow..|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	That's not a miniature pitbull, that's just a pitbull whos weight falls in under the small side of the scale (30-60 lbs usually)|`|AA10029366	I find it *nearly impossible* to believe that someone who is supposedly a veterinarian could rescue an obviously physically unhealthy dog...and then decide to breed it.    That is probably the most unethical thing I've seen in a very long time.    She was due to whelp in Summer 2008 (according to the site)...I wonder if the litter killed her...?|`|Rva0ocMOaa	That is absolutely ridiculous! I honestly don't even know what to say to that... it is ridiculous. "designer breeds" are out of control.|`|qEOJzbJraa	I hate BYB's and Puppymillers.    But, I will say this, it is not the worst of the worst. I have seen worse believe me this doesn't even touch the 15 foot yard line. The worst site I have seen so far trying to pass off mutts as a "pit bulls", is Mugelstons Pit Bull Farm. There dogs are over the top and are indeed Mastiff/Bulldog mixes rather than any APBT. The dogs on there site are not even close to standards but are far beyond that.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	This isn't even a "designer breed".  It is just a name given to their one runt b""h.  No way of knowing if her small size is even inheritable.  But, of couse if the mother is abnormally small, then all of her offspring, no matter what they are bred to (must be regular size males since she is the first mini bull),. are going to be small too   Why are people so stupid to believe this stuff.    Legit:  like the dogs (mutts) hate the names & people who breed them.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	Omfg    This is insane  Its like the teacup bulldog I saw    I hate the designer mutt trend  Its harmful and pointless  Its more of a fashion statement|`|AyOM41obaa	tinkerbulls hmmm...i think i like them i have a normal pitbull myself|`|wCDAYGd0aa	wow that's the stupidest thing I have ever seen|`|nGjMvGYqaa	Oh good lord. This is terrible! There is such a problem with pit bulls right now. With all of the breed prejudice that is occuring in the world right now with pit bulls, you would have to be a terribly irresponsible and heartless person to bring a new breed of pit into the world that is not even pure. Designer dogs are a horrible idea. Its pure irresponsibility. These people should be banned! Not the pit bulls!|`|DIjL6Tuvaa	I think designer dogs are a bit silly. I'm all for people loving mixed breed dogs; go down to a shelter and pick up a lovable mutt. However, when people buy "designer" dogs, they seem to have the misconception that only the good traits of either dog breed will emerge and none of the bad.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Theyre cute, but wow. When will it stop. Pretty soon there will be no "purebred" dogs. As for "designer dogs" aka mutts, its just a way for people to sell them for more money. I personally HATE that term and cant believe they actually sell for that much. I have a min pin and a boxer mix (or should I say designer dog, lol). I love them both, but I believe the integrity of purebreds is being harmed.    Oh yeah, and look at this: Its a mini rottweiler AKA "carlin pinscher"    http://breeders.dogbreedinfo.com/index.p...|`|AA11782255	how do i feel about designer dogs? sad.     i think that there should be restrictions put on all dog breeding until the homeless animal population goes way down.     WHY breed or buy while shelter pets die?  are shelter pets not good enough?|`|K8t1lPXsaa	i find it stupid to miniaturize the breed any further considering there is already the staffie. and what good will it do? people trying to make a quick buck and more ill bred bullys that can add to their already bad rap?     i believe everyone truly has a love for their own breed of owned dogs because that's why they got them. and we wouldn't have any of those breeds if it weren't for well planned and thorough mixed breeding but almost all of these new designer breeds are just playing off of cuteness to make money off of gullible people who want a small or cuddly looking dog. but it's ALWAYS the dogs who suffer|`|mfXDUkRYaa	I don't see how this person, as a "veterinarian" and "responsible breeder" can have a brain between his ears. Aren't there enough "Tinkerbulls" around already, being put down in shelters?|`|VaYjl71Laa	and i thought I was not going to drink tonight.    Legit:  I think the people who breed designer dogs are ALMOST as retarded as those who buy them.  Honestly, I tell these morons if they feel like pissing away good cash to give me 1/2 the cost of the dog and ill eventually buy a new car.

n4pNNcGfaa	You can use Nature's Miracle to clean up the mess.  It's an enzymatic cleaner that will break down the urine and feces so there is no odor left.  When you clean up with non-enzymatic products a slight odor is left behind that the dog can detect.  Covering it with the perfumey smell of some cleaners won't fool the dog's nose.    There are products you can buy to keep dogs off lawns, but they will not work inside the home.  So if you're looking for some sort of repellent to stop them from urinating it 1) isn't available and 2) wouldn't work anyway.  You'd have to douse the whole house or they'd just move to an untreated area.    The only real solution is to re-house-train the dogs.  The enzyme cleaning will assist with the retraining but cannot cure it by itself.
1dG0XlWNaa	Which of the dogs is newer in the household? I'm wondering if the Lhasa gets more snuggles, lap time, attention in general. That would make me jealous!  It's hard to have your shepherd mix sit on your lap!   What sexes are they? An altered (neutered) male and female would probably get along best; two of same sex can fight for first place.    Good for you for asking for help!  The collie/shepherd mix is probably really smart. The dog needs work and exercise. Think of yourself sitting for 5 hours in a bus that doesn't stop. That's how an energetic dog feels if not worked enough.  Best wishes.|`|nGjMvGYqaa	This is a socialization problem. How old are your dogs?   You need to begin the socialization process as early as possible. Jealousy issues can lead to aggression which is a very bad thing. If you dogs are young, you can work with them and train them to mellow out a little. If your dogs are older, you may want to seek some professional help from a trainer or a behaviorist.
