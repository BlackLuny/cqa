zpwFnRekaa	lanimirc a fo syad (Days of a Criminal) : "Nihilist apologetics"<br>  Nihilist apologetics? Nihilists are a lot of things, but apologetic is not one of them.<br>  Thanks for this thread, its interesting.<br>  <br>  Its really not surprising that Christians fail to understand the atheist mentality; if they could understand it, they'd be one. You can not believe in the impossible once you know better.|`|b1PvVoB0aa	Atheism is about the rejection of religion, Christianity in particular. Of course there are no rituals or anything like that.<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that we are saved by faith, not works. "Good" and "bad" do not determine salvation.<br>  <br>  My personal experiences with atheists have not been good. I have dealt with all sorts of people, like Muslims, New Agers, and the like. However, the atheists are the only ones that have been openly hostile to my beliefs. I have witnessed rants, ridicule, and poor arguments from these "rational and free-thinking" people. I long to talk with a intelligent and respectful atheist.|`|hl0t1sIMaa	Hmm, I see them as people who are continually trying to deny God, but I don`t think any less of the people themselves. Christians are meant to love EVERYONE, including Atheists. So, if there are Christians being unkind to them, the Christians are doing wrong.<br>  They can certainly be fine people, but without God, the Bible states they`re still going to hell, even though God doesn`t want them to. I personally also don`t like that. I don`t want them to go to hell! I would rather that they get a second chance.<br>  <br>  <br>  To, `Worship God or die`, what happened to `love you enemies?`|`|Jyxi74x0aa	I used to be one. Rituals and ceremonies? You kidding? Well, I attended church when I was an atheist, and a few wedding ceremonies. But that has nothing to do with atheism does it.<br>  <br>  Yes, I do believe atheists deserve hell. Just like I deserve it. We all fall short of God's perfect standard. Good thing we have an escape option.|`|i4CHWGfQaa	Dear Loved One,<br>  <br>  Speaking as a man who has faith in Jesus Christ, and considers God to have the final say in all matters. I say, it is not important what I think or don't think about atheist or atheism!<br>  <br>  I don't concern myself with other religions or religious beliefs. I read the Word of God and believe when God instructs us to obey Him then that is what we are to do!<br>  <br>  If God tells us to do something and we don't, and we are so disobedient to His will, then we should not expect anything from Him.<br>  <br>  Those who are alive in the flesh and have a relationship with God are Spiritually alive, and they will have eternal life when their flesh dies and the Spirit lives in Eternity.<br>  <br>  <br>  God Blesses Us Always, Believe it and Receive It!<br>  In Jesus Christ's name, Amen!  <')))><|`|VY5Scj9zaa	i think God will understand and forgive <br>  i hope God will understand and forgive|`|AA11225745	Atheism is disbelief in God (I was agnostic almost atheist for almost 23ys, I recently gave my life to Christ.) I dont think that they attend any type of ceremony or rituals. "Upstanding" is admirable, but just because you are not a murder, rapist, or the worst of the worst (who by the way if they give their life to Christ and walk away from their sins will enter the kingdom of Heaven) does not mean that you are upstanding. Do not be deceived or conformed to this world we must understand that (Romans 3:22 ) righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference. God is not "human" He does not operate on human standards. This is not about bad vs good this is about right and wrong and as previously mentioned righteousness from God comes through FAITH in Jesus, and only God is righteous in making the sinner righteous. Before giving my life to God I was "upstanding" but I also told white lies, I was also fornicating and cursed I made choices in my life that was going to send me straight to hell. Love, I dont think that it is right that people make the CHOICE to go to hell, when Jesus came here and died for our sins in order for us not to go to hell. <br>  <br>  Some of us because we are human think that Jesus was man-made etc, but what they dont understand is that 1. He is not 2. He did not come to condemn the world but to save us(John 3:17). He dont care about what you did what you thought He just wants us to have faith in Him that our sins are forgiven, He came to make us right not good but right. Simply ask Him into your heart and you are saved. Nothing religious about it.<br>  <br>  God lives and He is coming back|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	Having been an atheist, I would say that a lot of it is out of anger, frustration, disappointment and a fair amount of ego.  <br>  But I think their belief is sincere.  They really don't believe there is a God.  I think once in a while they still have doubts about who Jesus was and why He was so different than anyone else.  And an occasional nagging thought like "what if I'm wrong?".  <br>  <br>  I think that if a person wants nothing to do with God in this life, they won't suddenly love God in the next.  And God will not force them into an eternity where He is always being worshipped.  But, unfortunately, since every good thing we know comes from God, and when they go to a place where God does not visit and self rules, yes they will be in hell.  <br>  <br>  But I also know that God promises that anybody who seeks Him will find Him when they seek with their whole heart.  I know it's true because it happened to me.|`|0a14Mg2kaa	christians are irrational...just look at these answers!|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Rituals and ceremonies? Well, first they purge themselves of all emotion and sentimentalism, and replace it with pure logic, to make them so smart.

Isaiah 64:6<br>  <br>  Atheism is the belief that their is no God.  The Bible says that "the fool has said in his heart there is no God"<br>  <br>  This must be resolved by them.  they are not my enemy anymore than anyone else.  We are to treat everyone with love and whenever possible to live peacably with all men.<br>  <br>  As it says above, it doesn't matter how "good" you think you are, you're measuring yourself against other humans.  God measures you against Him. You will never meet God's standards.  That is why salvation is a gift of grace.|`|tW86bOMNaa	As an atheist, it's always been a puzzle to me why Christians should have *any* great concern about *my* faith (or lack of it) let alone the dude who has ten firearms, or whatever it was.

u1BX2aw0aa	For the first question... I have read some of the bible before and I just can't sink my head into the crap that it's feeding you guys and I don't know how you can believe that someone lived for 500 some years and then died when most people are barely reaching 80 right now and before it was a miracle if you lived to 40.

St john the devine described fire breathing horses with breast plates not tanks...<br>  <br>  SORRY TO SATURATE YOUR FIREWORKS IN URNINE... but jesus tells people in multiple places to follow the old testamant to make sure they are called first into heavan....<br>  1) “For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.”  (Matthew 5:18-19 RSV)  Clearly the Old Testament is to be abided by until the end of human existence itself.  None other then Jesus said so.<br>  <br>  2) All of the vicious Old Testament laws will be binding forever.  "It is easier for Heaven and Earth to pass away than for the smallest part of the letter of the law to become invalid."  (Luke 16:17 NAB)<br>  <br>  3) Jesus strongly approves of the law and the prophets.  He hasn’t the slightest objection to the cruelties of the Old Testament.  "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.  I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.  Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place."  (Matthew 5:17 NAB)<br>  <br>  3b) "All scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for refutation, for correction, and for training in righteousness..."  (2 Timothy 3:16 NAB)<br>  <br>  3c) "Know this first of all, that there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God." (2 Peter 20-21 NAB)<br>  <br>  4) Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient children according to Old Testament law.  Mark.7:9-13  "Whoever curses father or mother shall die"  (Mark 7:10 NAB)<br>  <br>  5) Jesus is criticized by the Pharisees for not washing his hands before eating.  He defends himself by attacking them for not killing disobedient children according to the commandment: “He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.”  (Matthew 15:4-7)<br>  <br>  6) Jesus has a punishment even worse than his father concerning adultery: God said the act of adultery was punishable by death. Jesus says looking with lust is the same thing and you should gouge your eye out, better a part, than the whole.  The punishment under Jesus is an eternity in Hell.  (Matthew 5:27)<br>  <br>  7) Peter says that all slaves should “be subject to [their] masters with all fear,” to the bad and cruel as well as the “good and gentle.”  This is merely an echo of the same slavery commands in the Old Testament. 1 Peter 2:18<br>  <br>  8) “Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law" (John7:19) and “For the law was given by Moses,..." (John 1:17).<br>  <br>  9) “...the scripture cannot be broken.” --Jesus Christ, John 10:35 <br>  <br>  FOLLOW THE OLD TESTAMENT!!!<br>  <br>  EDIT AGAIN (i should be getting more points for this):  "Yet when Jesus said to follow the OT law I think He means to try to be as good as a human as possible" underlines I THINK... we have now moved to the blatant realm of opinion and personal interprettion (as if werent already there), whatever you think bares almost no relavance to the actual bible... you might also 'think' that the animal sacrifices are metaphorical... they are not. Two things happen here A) Old testament vengeful god gives lots of stupid commands B) Jesus tells you  "Know this first of all, that there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God." (2 Peter 20-21 NAB) basically all scripture was written by god and you should obey it. that is pretty final.<br>  <br>   Another thing about the whole tanks issue tanks hardly 'spit fire' they usually fire shells, there is of course muzzle flash and there are flame throwing tanks (altogether more rare) but tanks spit bombs not fire.... Horses are still used in wars today as well...<br>  <br>  More on the idea of a loving god... God can do anything.... God loves us very much... god can end our suffering instantly because he does not this means that he A) Does not love us B) can not do anything<br>  <br>  More condoning of slavery in the bible Peter says that all slaves should “be subject to [their] masters with all fear,” to the bad and cruel as well as the “good and gentle.”  This is merely an echo of the same slavery commands in the Old Testament. 1 Peter 2:18<br>  <br>  On the flying spagetti monster... i think you missed the point on this one, FSM has equal evidence than the evidence for god... so it would be sane to say that there is equal chance of each existing...|`|6978689d5750d49479f02abe1bc6a8e8aa	Please read all if you want to respond.  I don't like responses like "I didn't read the whole thing . . . you're just wrong . . . sorry"  <br>  <br>  (Note also the proper use of the ellipsis [ . . .]; it's three dots, not two).<br>    <br>  Anyway, you've got to be kidding me.  The Book of Revelation is supposed to have been written in the late 1st Century.  Horses were used in warfare even as late as World War II.  That is nearly two thousand years that horses were used in warfare after John wrote.  Yet you claim that "The horses are clearly participating in some kind of war. Since this war has yet to happen, we know they can't be actual horses."  Why could he not have been describing some future war that still used horses, even if the horses John describes are clearly not real horses?<br>  <br>  Further, although you admit that John's language is metaphoric, symbolic, you jump to the conclusion that the only possible thing these lion-headed, fire-spouting horses could be representing is tanks.  John describes a number of highly fanciful creatures in his writings, all of which have, over the intervening centuries, been interpreted as "actually" representing something else.  Your interpretation could be correct, although I don't really see how that fits with the horses having the heads of lions, or why he wouldn't have described them as fire-spewing chariots, rather than horses.  But at any rate yours isn't the only possible interpretation.  Perhaps they're just fanciful creatures, as often appear in stories.  The point is this passage doesn't prove anything, except that the writer had a vivid imagination.<br>  <br>  Now, as to your "fallacies."  First, no one that I know of has ever claimed that "cavemen" wrote the Bible.  "Primitive" doesn't necessarily mean even prehistoric, let alone paleolithic.  It simply means that these men were unsophisticated and pre-scientific.  And by the way, "cavemen" didn't have the "knowledge of a monkey," at least not the Neandethals, the Cro-Magnon, Homo Habilis, and the like.<br>  <br>  Second, of course we know that the tooth fairy, Zeus, and the Flying Spaghetti Monster are the creations of men.  That is precisely the point.  The FSM, in particular, was created precisely to critique the inconsistencies of the various religious systems.  "Prove to me that God doesn't exist, " the believers cry.  Okay, forget about the FSM.  Prove to me that Zeus, Ahura-Mazda, or Dionysus don't exist, gods which many millions of people over the centuries have believed in.  Even better, prove to me that Vishnu doesn't exist, a god that  some one billion people believe in right now, today.  The FSM may not have a Holy Book but Hinduism certainly does, and Hinduism predates Christianity by at least a thousand years.<br>  <br>  Finally, you claim that God "allows" Satan to wreak havoc.  Do you actually think that is a reasonable explanation?  Why does He "allow" this to happen?  Don't you think that human beings would have enough to deal with -- fragile, fallible, weak human beings -- without having to deal with the attacks of some Hell-spawned demon?  How nice that those innocent, starving children will be taken up to Heaven.  I'm quite sure such knowledge would be great comfort to them as they die the long, agonizing death of starvation, their distended bellies and feeble cries apparently beyond the immediate consideration of the all-loving God.  And what happens to those poor children who have the misfortunes of being eleven, or twelve, or sixteen when they die of starvation.  Do they, assuming they were unlucky enough to be born into a non-Christian society, then end up in Hell?  If not, what does happen to them?  Your comments leave this question unanswered.<br>  <br>  I, too, am one of those atheists who have read the Bible.  I was raised a Christian, but as I grew older and learned more, I could no longer reconcile my early beliefs with what I knew about the world, and about history, science, comparative religion, etc.  I eventually came around essentially to the position of the 5th-Century BC Greek philosopher Epicurus:  Either God wants to eliminate evil and cannot, or He is able to eliminate evil and does not wish to.  If He wants to and can't He is impotent.  If He can and doesn't want to He is wicked.  If He can do it and wants to do it, then why is there evil.  If He is unable and/or unwilling to do it, why call Him God?  You should try reading the Bible with an open mind, as you admonish the Unbelievers to do, instead of from the standpoint of belief, or at least in the state of mind you would adopt if you were to read the Koran or the Mahabaratha.|`|FYFyQVZfaa	Shut up, you Christians are so full of sh*t.<br>  There IS no God. <br>  You actually believe an invisible being is REAL?

tx4bRDrXaa	I was raised by my grandmother who taught me to read as soon as I could talk.The textbook being the Bible.She taught me to respect and love all religions ,preachers and the clergy.<br>  <br>  She seen to it that I always got to church on Sunday,no matter what.I visited every Church in our city, was taught different Doctrines.I was baptized in the Baptist Church after one month's attendence I was pressured most of all by the preacher and my friends,and needless to say I was scared to death.My family told me it was my descision but I had a lot of peer pressure and went ahead with it ,But I was very discouraged when I saw my same friends who wanted me to be baptized ,wanting me to party,get drunk,smoke and curse with them.<br>  <br>  I was only 12 years old ,but I felt like it was a waste of time nothing had changed and I was really serious and wanted something better.I later married and attended the Baptist Church,The Holiness Church ,Church of God you name it. Then I started studying the Bible with Jehovah's Wittnesses,I was 18 at the time and they asked me where did I get my Bible knowledge and I told them my story.<br>  <br>  Even though I knew the scriptures I did not understand them.It was difficult for them to come to my home and study because I lived so far away from everything.But they studied with me for 9 years.I wanted to make the right descision .My family and I  were baptized,and have been Wittnesses for 35 years and have only one regret,and that is I didn't learn the truth from the Bible sooner.<br>  <br>  So if you are interested in Spiritual things ,Study all religions,but the Bible is what really is the touchstone. Read different translations and pray to God that he will help you to find the real truth from his word.<br>  <br>  Psalm 83:18  ,john 13,34,35  John 10:11,12 Psalm 83:18<br>  <br>  Matthew 24:14 Matthew 28:19,20 Proverbs 2:1-14<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to convert you,just answer your question we just present the Bible and it's teachings and let you make the descision.John 8:32<br>  <br>  God does not want those who are coerced but he wants those to serve him out of love for him.|`|0a14Mg2kaa	i was raised christian but then I embraced rational thought, I am now an atheist.|`|i0OVwfcyaa	Raised in a Methodist/Catholic household, but I never bought it.

But yet there are thousands of female Preachers, pastors, evangelist, etc. Proof once again that we only follow the parts of the Bible that we choose to accept. <br>  Simply put; God created men and women with separate but viable, needed roles. Without these roles as a form of guideline we do not know how to fulfill our roles as members of God's Church. Without a loving, caring obedient wife we do not as men know how to act that way towards Christ as members of his Body (Church). Without men protecting, teaching and providing for our wives we do not know how to watch for, expect and and receive these gifts form Christs Church. God created men and women to serve a specific function that we now ignore. It's not nor has it ever been to make women "less then men". Its what was designed by the Loving Creator. It is simply a tool to be used to learn ones place in God's Family. <br>  Hope this helps and bring on the thumbs down for not backing up the feminist agenda...<br>  EDIT: Interesting view TRUTH QUEST, one that I share with you... but, do you know where that "small flock" is today?|`|18fc9de117862836945750b962545465aa	Read the story in context, Paul is answering according to the law. <br>  Personally, I compare what the apostles said to what Jesus said, it seems these other guys had to make it hard and complicated where Jesus said, my load is light, my work is easy.|`|Re3k96THaa	It's completely saying that the woman is a gender less then men.|`|vL8JErXNaa	St Paul was a nut.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Probably, in part, because some believing wives have unbelieving husbands.<br>  <br>  If u think that's controversial, mention Oneness!<br>  Some ppl hate the truth.|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	First you have to know what "The Church" is. It is not the false Christianity that God identifies as  "Mystery Babylon, The Mother of all Harlots".<br>  <br>  That is Catholicism (Mother) and Protestantism (harlots).<br>  <br>  God true Church is referred to as a "small flock" and they "keep the Commandments".<br>  <br>  Yes, that scripture does apply to the True Church as does ALL of scripture.
zPfgFXU5aa	The delusion is only going to affect Nonbelievers who don't want to hear the truth about God because they love their own self-will, even though it leaves them empty inside. They would rather be in control of their own lives than deal with what the holiness of God requires of them. <br>  <br>  <br>  God does not immediately send them a delusion if they don't embrace the gospel the first time they hear it. God is just and he waits until they have rejected him so completely that there is no returning from there so he first gives them chance after chance to believe.<br>  <br>  He sends people to witness to them, he cause his word to be spoken to them, he does everything he can to attract their attention and show them his truth.<br>  <br>  When it is certain that their minds are already made up, they have rejected God and nothing will ever make them change their minds, repent and be saved, God gives them what they want and lets them believe in a lie. <br>  <br>  And because those people have rejected God so completely that they are beyond redemption, he will keep them deceived so that they will get exactly what they have coming to them on the day of judgement.<br>  <br>  The Bible doesn't say what the deception will be but whatever it is it allows Satan to bind them and cloud their minds. Possibly the deception is that they will believe the antichrist is the real jesus or it might just be that they will be deceived by a false gospel preached by a false church.<br>  <br>  The point is that only people who are so lost that there is no turning around are going to fall under the spell of this strong delusion and it's purpose is to ensure that justice is dished out to the guilty.|`|b164e8d4d76ceb0d7f6bd403bdc7ecd8aa	Perhaps god is the ultimate delusion.|`|YI8V5e36aa	a divine god does not get mad or demand worship|`|uLYlQMs3aa	Because of 1 Thessalonians 5:21-22 "Prove all things, Hold fast to that which is good; Abstain from the appearance of all evil"<br>  Most Christians Don't prove anything. Most can't prove half of what they follow and observe. When someone does take the time to show them they don't care. You can suggest good reading to help them and they will still ignore it. We willing go separate from Gods way and then complain when someone else ignores his rules a little differently. The point is it's no wonder that atheist laugh at "christians", most have no idea what to believe or what to not believe. Its sickening. God has already sent the strong delusions into the world its why so many religions exist under the single banner of "christianity". I could sit here and easily defeat each denomination on the grounds of the Sabbath and the Holy Days of God alone. So I hope this helps you in understanding why God would. Its to test the resolve, faith and diligence of his followers. For if our heart does not  truly belong to God, if his Holy Spirit is not actively working in our everyday lives.. Strong delusions will lead us away.<br>  Good Luck|`|vSlG3ayiaa	It says right there in 2 Thessalonians why he does it.  He does it because they did not receive the love of the truth.|`|LJlaHLQdaa	this is the test:<br>  <br>  "To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them" (Isa. 8:20). The people of God are directed to the Scriptures as their safeguard against the influence of false teachers and the delusive power of spirits of darkness. Satan employs every possible device to prevent men from obtaining a knowledge of the Bible; for its plain utterances reveal his deceptions. At every revival of God's work the prince of evil is aroused to more intense activity; he is now putting forth his utmost efforts for a final struggle against Christ and His followers. The last great delusion is soon to open before us. Antichrist is to perform his marvelous works in our sight. So closely will the counterfeit resemble the true that it will be impossible to distinguish between them except by the Holy Scriptures. By their testimony every statement and every miracle must be tested.<br>  <br>     Those who have not made thorough work of repentance under the light God has been pleased to give to his people since that time, will not see things clearly, and will be ready to call the messages God sends, a delusion.<br>  <br>       "We should be the last people on the earth to indulge in the slightest degree the spirit of persecution against those who are bearing the message of God to the world. This is the most terrible feature of unchristlikeness. Sometime it will be seen in its true bearing, with all the burden of woe that has resulted from it."|`|kTaa8ejpaa	They will have had plenty of opportunities in their lives to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour.  The age of the gentile is drawing to a close and when it does, those not raptured, will find it darn near impossible to come to Christ and if they do, it will mean their beheading.<br>  <br>  They will be swayed by a smooth talker, someone of Obama's ilk.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	People who persistently refuse to cooperate with God's grace and his plan have no right to expect God to put up with their nonsense, forever.<br>  <br>  Once that point is reached, God just might leave them to deal with their issues on their own, and that's when things tend to get scary (in a "road to perdition" sort of way).|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	The answer to your question is found IN verse 10.<br>  They have already rejected Jesus, so God will send delusion so they cannot believe. <br>  <br>  "because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved." ..."And for this reason..."  It's pretty clear in the passage itself.|`|yB0nVXfWaa	More and more, God is going to make it very obvious who are the sheep and who are the goats and the issue is : truth.  It is not love, as so many preachers today would have us believe, it is still the old thing, the truth - in fact, the Gospel truth.  You see, you have to receive and believe the truth in order to be saved and, once saved, you have to continue in it.  It is good to walk in love, but it is believing the truth that saves you.<br>  <br>  This is what the Reformers died for and nothing has changed, but nowadays there are a lot of people who like to hear that less than ever.  And, within the Church, too, for in our times there has never been such an onslaught on biblical truth - from 'within' - as I see it now.  I have a few years clocked up, so I can speak with a bit of 'perspective' on this matter.  <br>  <br>  And what happens when people desert biblical truth? - they perish.  For, after they have believed 'the (big) lie' they fall into evil practices, because the new doctrines which come in are impure.  God will let such do according to their choices - he will take forth the pure out of the impure - so that all may see, in these last days.  <br>  <br>  So, when Christians say that what you believe doesn't matter, you just need love;<br>  when they say that there is truth in all religions;<br>  when they say that all roads lead to God;<br>  when they say that God would be unjust to condemn good people;<br>  when they say that we must build 'links' with our catholic brethren;<br>  links with the Muslims and those of other faiths;<br>  and even those with no faith at all;<br>  that we must be 'inclusive' and 'not judge'<br>  that we must serve more and not argue about points of faith, <br>  that we must build 'the kingdom' right here and now;<br>  that we must practice 'spiritual disciplines' from eastern sources,<br>  that we must go into mysticism, labyrinths, 'dark places', light candles, burn incense, bring back icons, get back into 'Lent', 'centering prayer' and try 'novatian exercises' - is that true?  Is that the true Gospel, or is it 'another' (Gal.1:6-10).<br>  <br>  Not only that, when Christians of this sort also have among them people who speak like Doctor Ruth from the pulpit, drawing in young people with perverse talk;<br>  people who 'love Jesus but don't like the Church';<br>  people who 'want to destroy Christianity...' (and replace it with?);<br>  people who speak of not being 'Christians' but 'Christ-followers';<br>  whose 'new missiology' means advising foreign new converts to 'just add Jesus' to their current worship;<br>  who speak against 'fundamentalists' and 'end-timers' as those who are 'holding society back', whom God (= they) will 'deal with';<br>  who laugh at Bible believers and call them 'traditionalists';<br>  who call the doctrine of Atonement 'slaughterhouse Christianity' and a 'vile doctrine' and the God behind it 'not the God they believe in'<br>  <br>  - Christians who are, in effect 'reimagining Christianity' so that the Gospel is no longer preached anymore and the doctrine taught bears no relation to the doctrine Christianity has lived and died for for nigh on 2,000 years.<br>  <br>  Is this not, I would suggest, the very 'lie' which was spoken of, and the very 'strong delusion' which is prophesied?<br>  <br>  This is the Emerging Church - coming to a church near you very soon, if it hasn't emerged there already.  Yes, I think we have it now, in our time.<br>  <br>  Now, you seem to be enamoured of Obama - and I agree, he is very charismatic and extremely gifted in oratory, a very clever and able man.  But - just a word - aren't these the very abilities which antichrist will have, when he comes?  I am not saying that Obama is the A., just that you should beware of the charismatic and look below the surface.<br>  <br>  Who gave Obama's inaugural address? - was it not pastor Rick Warren, the 'Purpose-Driven' worldwide bestseller?  Look at him, who his friends are, who he 'recommends' in his books, and you will see, not just what he says he believes, but actually what he DOES believe.  Now, I am not wishing to personally attack the man, nor the President, but all I am saying is that these two folk are not in the 'traditional', 'fundamentalist', 'bible-believing' camp, but belong rather to the 'Emerging Church' camp.  <br>  <br>  This movement has big bucks and megapolitics on its side and this, I believe, is the apostate movement, going worldwide, which is prophesied should come immediately before the Bible says it's 'bye-bye' for the true Church and 'hello' for the antichrist - as in II Thess. 2:3.  Yes, a worldwide apostasy (not a worldwide revival), and this movement is showing every sign of exactly fitting the bill, so keep looking up, folks!

Also how can someone be a Christian if there are no other religions to compare christianity to?  It would just not exist.|`|nCjkx8qPaa	Constructive opposition is healthy.

79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	>He can create anything he wants including a completely subserviant worshipper, why would he need us to do it?<br>  <br>  According to most christians, it's because what he values isn't worship itself, but worship given freely and through the conscious choice of the worshippers.<br>  <br>  Of course, this only pushes the question farther back. Namely, if God is TRULY omnipotent, why couldn't he also create a worshipper who is guaranteed to be totally devoted to him AND has free will? If as many christians claim God is outside not just the physics of our universe but its very logic as well, this should not be beyond his ability. In general, though, christians don't like thinking in deep enough terms to come up with answers to stuff like this.<br>  <br>  >Christians, why would God require a blood sacrifice (Jesus) to absolve us of original sin when he could have just forgiven us without any kind of requirement?<br>  <br>  Actually, it's not about forgiveness. The idea in christianity is that no sin is allowed to enter Heaven, and in order for us to enter Heaven despite having original sin in our blood, we need to have some sin-free blood sacrificed for us, which can only be the blood of Jesus because being the son of God and not of man he was the only sin-free person available. In christianity, God loves all of us, and he forgives all of us, but we still cannot enter Heaven without having that sin-free blood sacrificed for us.<br>  <br>  Again, this just pushes the question farther back: Why did God create Heaven that way in the first place? A christian would probably answer this by saying that the very idea of Heaven is to be the best possible place, and so it must be free of sin. But in that case, why did God create a set of rules by which the best possible place is a place that has a nature mutually contradictory with a human being in it? For the matter of that, how can Heaven even BE the best possible place if it is of a nature that humans cannot be in it without Jesus's sacrifice? Wouldn't a truly BEST place be just as good as Heaven AND allow everyone in? Again, though, christians will usually turn off their brains when faced with these sorts of questions, and answer by simply avoiding the question and talking about how God is so loving and Jesus's sacrifice is so wonderful and so on.<br>  <br>  >Why would the revelations of an omnicient being be scientifically, historically, or logically inaccurate?<br>  <br>  Maybe if he wanted them to be?<br>  <br>  Of course, that brings up the question of why an omnipotent being (and apparently an all-loving one at that) would have any reason to lie to us.|`|AA11019941	If u realy read all these religion book speacilly Quran then u must know all the answers .

I can't give you one answer that will explain all the others. So, think about asking one at a time. <br>  <br>  I have a question for you, Have you ever sat down and thought about what you would do if you were God dealing with these people,and you can't just make a robot and make life easy? <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like you distrust God because the world isn't perfect.  If that's true then when you read the Bible,didn't you see what happened in the beginning with Adam and Eve and how they choose evil, and scroll down a few years and see how we are still choosing evil today?  <br>  <br>  So, my answer to your questions is;  Would you really want God to make us immortal in the current world we live in?  How long do you want to live in fear and suffering from the crazies and destruction in this world?  I mean just think if we couldn't die.  If I have aids or cancer, am deformed or maimed in some way, or suffer at the hands of another human being and I was doomed to live this way forever.....No Thanks. <br>  <br>  I'm so thankful that God has a solution and is big on giving second chances, so I can at least have the chance to go back and reclaim Eden for myself this time.|`|7cLYgf2raa	I will keep this simple so maybe you can grasp it.You have a child. You give your son his own house. You sign the house over, title deed and all. You have made laws of ownership. Your son invites some very bad people in to live with him.Do you violate your own ownership laws to force your son to do right?<br>      Or do you make a suggestion that your son give you power of attorney over his house so you, who is overwhelmingly powerful over those bad people, can rush in and kick the bums out.Or do you just knock your son in the head and take over against his will?<br>       Now your son, joins with the bad people and actually commits crimes against others. Now he is defiled with sin.That has to be paid.

I believe in my definition of "God," which is the Cosmos and its universal laws, its eternal source. It is not in the slightest humanish and has no human characteristics. It has never co-authored a book and has no interest in our religions and myths. It neither judges nor intervenes. It possesses intelligence of a sort, beyond our own, and a kind of latent consciousness, but not in any human way. God simply IS. It simply exists, and we are a part of it. God is the source "star" of eternity from which we are the starstuff. As fragments of this force passing through physical forms, we exist and we exercise free will within universal laws.

God is a powerful Spiritual Energy generating power through activity and at times slumbering and recharging his energy resources. Love empowers him, hate dimishes his force of power.<br>  <br>  The murder of the Christ was caused by the uprising of the mob, the state, the monarchy and the church against Jesus engineered by Satan his coveter, stalker and rival. The damage limitation exercise dismissed his death as a sacrifice to exonerate the establishment. The prevalent evil killed Jesus. None have met God. All testimonies are of the voice of his conscience, and are but allegorical accounts. <br>  <br>  The sins of the fathers are visited upon the child as his actions and what he plants grow to be avenged upon his child. It is a testimony and law for would be sinners to consider long term consequences of their actions. This cycle of vengeance is unending until one acknowledges the sin, repents and takes steps to address and compensate for the error of judgment causing mankind to remain in the web of deceit and duality, death and rebirth the recurring groundhog day.<br>  <br>  You have a son you know will grow and demand his freedom and free will. You have limited governance and control of your world, yet you produced a child to live within it. Tomorrow your son will mature and venture out into the world with the guidance and counsel you have instilled into him. If he chooses to dismiss your advice then there is little you can do but assist in remedy. It is a right your son and mankind demand and receive. Is it what we consciously ordained, what they demanded or what is a force of procreative habit of living?<br>  <br>  If the child errs because of a lack of parenting, or peer pressure, or bad company and counsel the parent advised the child against, then the parents are disinclined to intervene when mishaps arise. It is unfortunately sods law. God is not entirely dissimilar in his judgments.<br>  <br>  Revelations are testimonies and witness accounts based upon the partial understanding of those who write them. All scriptural testimony must have sound premise and be based upon reason than a quest to conceal disclosure of circumstance and misadventure by the initial participles. One error of the primal God in mortal form haunts him for an eternity. The demons having learnt of people governance seek to retain ‘’God’’ simply to validate their own existence. Few care about Gods world or interests.<br>  <br>  The negative forces nurture hate, look around you, they literally plant the seeds of discontent and hatred, warfare and battling to profit from the divisions and strife caused. The people are as sheep and equally as malleable and corruptible. Many great Saints and Prophets have died trying to save humanity from entrapment, to no avail. In the dawn of the age of Aquarius, of enlightenment, we will see peace and global unity. Amen.|`|PWankIUpaa	Sir , <br>  Many of us have answered your questions !

His need to create comes from who he is and is not infringed by his omni- whatever.  It's possible that it infringes on His perfection, but that is debatable.<br>  <br>  He rested because it was Good.  He didn't need to do anything more.<br>  <br>  Your next questions have to do with original sin.  It is my belief that everyone is born perfect, but when they reach an age of accountability and sin they are therefore punishable by y death.  It isn't that blood is needed, it's death that is necessary.  The blood is just a picture of the life that is given.<br>  <br>  God has allowed humans to have free will.  Yes, this is a limitation God has placed on His omnipotence.  It means that by His own volition He is not all powerful.<br>  <br>  Your next paragraph is the problem of pain which is a big one in Christian theology.  I know of 5 or six respected christian theologians that have wrestled with the subject in lengthy books.  Namely C.S. Lewis, Henri Nuowen, Phillip Yancy, Ravi Zechariah, etc.  There isn't enough space here for the arguments.  If you want to E-mail me I will try and help.<br>  <br>  Even empirical evidence isn't trust worthy.  Sight, Hearing, smell, and touch have been proven to be not 100% reliable.  Existence itself is subject to definition and therefore questions.   The reality of absolute truth is the only thing we can hope we have, and then it isn't definate that our truth is absolute. <br>  <br>  On some level God does "need" as you said if he didn't need why would he have created.|`|SbN2cXE5aa	All your questions have sound biblical answers to them.  The verse that comes to mind for me is, "don't cast your pearls before swine", the point being, would you really care? Would solid answers (which you already have probably heard but reject) turn you to Christ? <br>  If you were a true seeker then you would find these out on your own instead of trying to show that Christians are wrong.  If you would like to email me because you are a seeker, I will be glad to help answer your questions.  I am glad that you are on here and you hear the truth on here, someday the seeds may bear fruit in your life, at least I pray.|`|UKzO3vqCaa	The laws of human nature do not apply to God, since God is not human. Often, God is described as having human characteristics, which only limits the understanding of all that God is.<br>  God is more than what humans can ever comprehend and it benefits us to understand that, rather than trying to figure out why "he" has allowed things that we see as abominations.|`|bVJDV6QPaa	Why does he require anything of us?  Yes,  when you love someone, you want them to be happy and you would do whatever was reasonable to make them happy.   It is same idea with God.  I mean  him asking us to follow two commandments, which is to love Him and to love our neighbor are really two commandments which help us understand the basics of love, which is to feel connected to all of humanity.  If He created all of humanity, just like a good parent, He would want us to get along with each other.  <br>  <br>  Why would God need to rest?  The truth is that Gd never rest.  That is apart of the very definition of God.  The Sabbath was given for humanity, not the other way around.  We are to rest on the seventh day, whatever day that is that we decide for ourselves.  The NT specifies do not worry what day what day you practice the Sabbath, just give yourself rest.   Also, Jesus said that if your ox falls into a ditch, would you not work to get it out of the ditch.  He says rest but that we are to still do good works.  Doing good works on the Sabbath is not against the Sabbath.  <br>  <br>  Can being an Atheist stop God?  Actually everyone is an Atheist before they come to believe.  This is just a starting point, not a means to an end.  Once you start to question God with Why this and why that, you are on your way to a journey that only God can complete.<br>  <br>  Why starving children if a God?  Actually, Christ warns us that there would be famine, wars, and suffering as long as we are in this world.  What we are promised in the New Jerusalem is no more crying, lying and dying.  Believing in God does not mean people do not suffer.  Actually it is quite the opposite.  For even Christ said that if the world hates Him, then how much more will it hate those who believe?   Believing in God means that through our trials, we can be comforted by knowing that this is temporary, that God cares for us and will see us through this life.<br>  <br>  God's plan and our plan?  Truthfully, Job said it best when he said that everything under the sun is meaningless in the book of Eccesiastic.  He postulates that we are to serve God, and this is our sole purpose.   Once our plans are aligned with God's plan, then you really do not have worry about who you are because you focus is on who God is and you do not have to worry about what to do because your focus is on God can and is doing.<br>  <br>  God requirements from a mortal perspective?  God really in a since does not have but two commandments, to love Him and to love each other,  His wish is for us to connect, for all His children to be loving, the ideal parents wish. But actually, it is written that even the rocks will cry out His praises if not one in humanity does.  <br>  <br>  Inaccuracies?  Why four gospels? The four gospels are a testament of the accuracy of the truth.  Though not all the gospels were canonized, they all give a testament of the truth of Christ Jesus being the Son of God.  The bible in and of itself is a testimony to the salvation of humanity.  It tells of the how God reveals Himself to all of humanity throughout the ages.  If you want a straight timeline with no mistakes after 300 years then you will not get in the bible, to be inspired to just that, this is an inspired account of the salvation of humanity.  It is just as if I met Jesus, my account would be different than your account of meeting Jesus.  Does it mean we did not encounter Him, if I met Him on Tuesday and you met Him on Wednesday.  I have read the inaccuracies list and it is long but it does not change the salvation account.  <br>  <br>  You can agree to disagree with, as a regular on R&S, I am use to it.|`|goC3X1Reaa	Now I know you don't want any scripture in this but I felt the need to cite what I was saying. Here goes!<br>  <br>  God doesn't require anything of us. He doesn't need us to worship him. Example verses:<br>  <br>  {To Allah belong all things in heaven and earth: verily Allah is He (that is) free of all wants, worthy of all praise.}* (Luqman 31:26)<br>  <br>  {O mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah is Rich [Free of all wants and needs], Worthy of all praise.}* (Fatir 35:15)<br>  <br>  With regards to why he would create us, the angles asked him that question in chapter 2 verse 30.<br>  <br>  They said: “Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood?- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy (name)?” He said: “I know what ye know not.” <br>  <br>  In my religion God has created totally subservient worshipers (the angels), which is why they asked Him why he would create human beings when they (angels) are always praising and worshiping Him.<br>  <br>  The angles highlight that human beings would be mischief makers on earth, but if you read on, you will see that God shows the angels that human beings are intellectual beings that are able to make choices, and as a result have morals.<br>  <br>  The voluntary worship of human beings is more valuable than the automatic worship of angels. So a worshiping human is better than a worshiping angel to God.<br>  <br>  You are right. God is inexhaustible. An example verse:<br>  <br>  {Allah is He besides Whom there is no god, the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsisting by Whom all subsist; slumber does not overtake Him nor sleep; whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth is His; who is he that can intercede with Him but by His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot comprehend anything out of His knowledge except what He pleases, His knowledge extends over the heavens and the earth, and the preservation of them both tires Him not, and He is the Most High, the Great.}* (Al-Baqarah 2:255)  <br>  <br>  In Islam Jesus never died for anyone's sins. Every person is responsible for their own sin. <br>  <br>  “No person earns any (sin) except against himself (only), and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”(6:164)<br>  <br>  This also means there is no such thing as the original sin where we inherited the sin of Adam and Eve (peace be upon them). The sin of Adam and Eve was their sin alone, and when they repented god forgave them.<br>  <br>  {Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful.} Al-Baqarah 2:37<br>  <br>  The repentance made is mentioned in 7:23<br>  <br>  {Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be among the losers.}<br>  <br>  The rest of your questions are answered in this lecture by Dr. Jeffery Lang (part 1-17).

I do have some trouble accepting the truth of those qualities mentioned.  Does god have power over the entire universe?  Does he know everything that happens in the universe?  Is he perfectly good?  As human beings, I don't think we really know the answers.  But nature seems to provide a clue.  All that can be said is that he is a higher being, and can do anything that he desires to do.|`|uLYlQMs3aa	All I can say my friend is read Matthew 7:6 "... Neither cast your pearls before swine..."<br>  You do not seek answers to your questions you seek argument to satiate your thirst for anti-govermental feelings. Atheism is the basis of anarchy. It stems from refusal to except a power that is above you. You seek to denounce God in hopes to make yourself feel better. Your understanding is based of of doctrinal mistruths. <br>  How many times must we see conventional Christianity fall prey to its own shortcomings due to its lack of Biblical understanding. Constantly they speak of that which they do not understand and wonder why so much controversy and error constantly is thrown back at them. If I had to put a number on it I'd say at least 80% of their beliefs are disproved by the very book they claim to get them from. This problem is what gives credence to your arguments. They provide their own fuel to the funeral pyre you are trying to roast them on!!<br>  I refuse to answer your questions until you seek to answer them yourself. <br>  I could suggest something to read that will answer your questions. But you are not interested in seeking truth just seeking arguments. <br>  So good luck and have a great life. One day you will get it, I know that.|`|w2GG8Z99aa	I, myself, do NOT hold true to quite a few 'traditional' christian beliefs and/or viewpoints and I am a Christian.

Don't wanna anger the majority (wink!). In reply to your statement, "Please, no answers like "It's a sin to question God", I do not see a thing wrong with questioning God. *Several* individuals in the Bible did just that, and besides, God is NOT intimidated by our questions to or of him!|`|gM7VuCM4aa	Your questions are not new, the very same questions have been asked by humans for centuries. The answers are many but never fully resolve anything. I think it is because we as humans don't have the capacity to fully understand. Maybe that is the reason for human life, to evolve into more spiritual beings so that we may understand the greatness of a Higher Power. Human beings are spiritual, that is a part of the human psyche, that's been proven. We have a mind, a body and a spirit. <br>  <br>  One thing I think for sure is that we are really all connected and until we realize that as a species war will continue. One of my favorite quotes is by Thich Nhat Hanh--"We are here to awaken from the illusion of our separateness." Maybe that is the answer.<br>  One God, one money value, one Nation, when all are created equal and treated equal. Lol...I never said it was possible, I'm just wondering if somehow that is part of the answer. Another favorite quote is from a Stephen King movie called, The Mist. The quote goes something like, "Humans are fundamentally an insane species, you put two or more in a room together and eventually they're taking up sides to fight one another." Maybe the human species can never fully understand any of your questions until we can evolve past WAR.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	you wont ever stop asking as there can be no actual conclusive answers to your query|`|WjRqYf6naa	*yawn* It's bad enough when people Google two pages of text in an answer, but it's really inexcusable in a question.|`|NFK3A68oaa	These questions show genuine thought, more space and time than YA will allow answers to.

That is why there is free will.    You have a son, would you of rather him been a robot or to love you unconditionally and by his own heart and soul.   Why is God any different then us as we all crave and want to be loved.    <br>  <br>  Suffering in the world?  how is that God's fault.  God gave us enough food to feed the world but man and greed is why there is still hunger, thirst, poverty, etc.    What do you do to help the less fortunate or just complain and blame God?<br>  <br>  Time:  Man put the world on a timetable not God.    7 days could have been 7 seconds or 7 billion years.  <br>  <br>  Religions?  All created by man which is why they are all flawed.   God said come together not form hundreds of different religions then judge others and kill in his name.  <br>  <br>  Blasphemy/rules:  You know them and you know the consequences.   The world we live in today also has rules, laws, regulations and consequences if you breaks those rules, you suffer the consequences.    So what is the difference?  <br>  <br>  A much different time back then and as for why Jesus-I guess that is a question only God could answer.   But, how much love he must have to be able to offer his only son, as you said it yourself you could never do it.<br>  <br>   Atheists try REALLY hard not to stand for anything... they will often proclaim that atheism isn't a belief... that is completely false. But they are trying to have nothing to defend. If they can just attack attack attack without having to offer any real cohesive alternative they will appear very wise. <br>   Atheists think that this universe either always existed, or made itself from nothing. I would like to see them look at atheism with the type of skepticism they throw at Christianity. It would reveal that the way to examine the world is to look for truth not to try your hardest to not believe anything (even though they have beliefs, they just kid themselves about it so that they don't have to defend anything against their own illogical standards)
uLYlQMs3aa	Simple one must be guilty of the very charge that Evolutionist accuse Christians of... Brain washing. They are taught and retaught that evolution is true and right.

Unsure... its full off doubt. Why? They can not prove it. They accept it on faith just as religious people accept their beliefs on faith. <br>  So in my humble and honest opinion, they ar ethe dumbest smart people around.

For instance if the sun moon and earth were a mere fraction off the distance that there is between them now then the earth would not exist in its form - It's hard for me to  believe that the big bang could precisely position the sun moon and earth..it seems that there is a bigger brain out there than us.

People today are taught the theory of species evolution as if it were an established fact - but they are frequently not taught about the bible in the same way.  So, for most (nearly all, I suspect), it is merely a matter of indoctrination.<br>  <br>  For those who believe in the theory of species evolution yet do not take everything they are taught at face value, it is simply a matter of what you trust.  Those who believe in species evolution trust the evidence supporting that theory more than they trust the evidence supporting the bible, or at least they feel that evidence supports the theory of species evolution (as a whole) much more strongly than evidence supports the bible (as a whole).  In other words, from a practical, logical standpoint, the theory of species evolution seems more likely to be accurate than the entire bible.<br>  <br>  Regardless, those who believe in the theory of species evolution *instead* of the bible have chosen to place their faith in an unproven scientific theory.  The history of popular scientific theories should be a mandatory class in all high schools.  If it were, there wouldn't be too many believers in the theory of species evolution - or most other scientific theories, for that matter.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|0hQyClksaa	onejotte...contrary to most of the unfounded opinions in the answers you've been given, Darwinism was disproven in the sixties with the advent of the science of genetics.  Once this happened, chosen men of "science" who didn't want to be accountable to God chose to fandango scientific terminology and . . . wha-la . . . the Synthetic theory of evolution was born.<br>  <br>  Just like it's predisessor, it has little to go on as far as scientific facts are concerned...the unlearned and brainwashed are those who chose to believe in it.  What those, such as Ernst Mayr and others have done, is to replace proven and demonstratable scientific facts with assumptions and untestable philosophical guidelines.  therefore, the theory of evolution is a dead theory, void of any coherent and intelligent ideas.  Only assumptions now taught to us as facts......but they are only assumptions, and the last 150 years has been enough time to prove that those assumptions are false.<br>  <br>  As for those who are telling you that scripture has no facts, they are unlearned and know nothing about what they would like us to think they know.  The entire bible has been demonstrated to be both scientifically and historically accurate (obviously except for those areas that are written as apocolyptic in nature).  Archoelogists have demonstrated that practically every major person recorded in scripture was a real individual, as well as every city and province named.....they have even unearthed the charred remains of Sodom and Gomorra.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is:  because they choose not to.|`|VMH0mm3maa	You shouldn't believe either.

Every group that ever existed on Earth has been sent a prophet by God to teach them about the oneness of God and to tell them to do good  and refrain from evil in order to be saved from hell and be given a place in heaven. We are only told the names of some of these prophets - Abraham, Moses, Noah, etc. <br>  <br>  Around One thousand 427 years ago, God sent down the last and final messenget, the Prophet Mohammad, peace be upon him. The difference between Mohammad and the prophets/messengers that were sent before him is that every prophet before was sent only to a certain group of people whereas Mohammad was sent as a prophet to the whole world. <br>  <br>  The Quran is a book sent by God to all of mankind:<br>  <br>  "This (revelation) is a means of insight for mankind, and a guidance and grace unto people who are endowed with inner certainty." <br>  45:20<br>  <br>  "Say: "O ye men!

Here is a parable set forth! listen to it! Those on whom, besides Allah, ye call, cannot create (even) a fly, if they all met together for the purpose! and if the fly should snatch away anything from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. Feeble are those who petition and those whom they petition!"<br>  22:73<br>  <br>  "O men! Call to mind the grace of Allah unto you! is there a creator, other than Allah, to give you sustenance from heaven or earth? There is no god but He: how then are ye deluded away from the Truth?"<br>  35:3<br>  <br>  "O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things)."<br>  49:13<br>  <br>  Is it true as per Quran? I'm not sure what you're asking, but if you're asking whether the religion is followed exactly as it should be, as it was set out to be in the Quran, then no, it is not followed correctly throughout most of the world. Bernard Lewis, the renowned historian/writer, is once known to have said: "Islam is the best religion, Muslims are the worst followers." <br>  In this day and age, there is nothing I could agree with more. To give us some credit though, there are some very knowledgeable and incredibly wise people who are trying to change this by educating some of the appalingly uneducated (both what the Western world calls the "extremists" and the "modernists/reformists"). Also, this is not as easy it seems and as some people seem to think it is. The Quran is in some cases ambigous, leaving the Muslims to work out what they think it means. And as we all know, there is nothing that one can get everyone to agree on. Even the most obvious of statements, "water is wet" for instance, will bring forth a barrage of ridicule and criticism from the skeptics. <br>  <br>  And of course there are those, the scum of society, who use Islam (any religion really, but Islam is being used more and more) to do wrong. What is one to do about it? What CAN one do about it really aside from trying to educate the world one person at a time. We do this with the hope that one day the sensible people on this earth will come together and say, "Enough! We've had enough of your lies and hypocrisy, no more are we going to put up with senseless attacks, either verbal or physical, on each other, no more are we going to stand by and watch innocent people suffer." <br>  It might never happen, but who has ever been able to live without hope? InshAllah, (If God wills) we will succeed. :)<br>  Peace|`|AA10792837	I dont understand what u r asking exactly?|`|AA12294821	no its not true .we dont know when this world will be over<br>  we know only some signs that indicates that world will be over soon<br>  but that doesnt mean its 1500 ,it can be more than.<br>  i think its already more than 1500 years|`|562186536239af45ecf590244924d98baa	No|`|AA11908600	No.  It is that the Prophet accomblished the culmination of the fulfilment of the Islam in its totality.

Oviamente que hay hombres que mismo con todos estos adelantos no pasan por mujeres sobre todo los trans alemanes que geneticamente son grandes, en realidad la gente no cree que un trans es creible pues solo ve en la calle a los que por su genetica no quedan bien, yo que soy fotografo , trabaje con una modelo, guapisima, que con el tiempo se hizo un poco amiga, entonces me dijo que fue hombre antes. Si van a Tailandia, veran que un 20% de las prostitutas en la zona roja de Bankok son trans y se ven muy mujeres, bueno los trans cobran mas que las autenticas...

ba43f273f730ad296258d821001f750aaa	El Shabat<br>  Shabat es una voz hebrea que significa “descanso”. Comienza el viernes a la caída del sol y concluye al anochecer del sábado. <br>  Este día los judíos han de abstenerse de ejecutar cualquier trabajo, tal como sembrar, arar, hornear, coser, encender o extinguir fuego y generar cualquier tipo de electricidad.<br>  El sábado se destina al estudio y a la instrucción religiosa, con el fin de satisfacer las necesidades espirituales. Por esta razón, el shabat es un acto profundo que representa la liberación de las preocupaciones rutinarias, la tranquilidad, la alegría y la elevación espiritual.<br>  <br>  <br>  Pésaj<br>  La pascua judía o Pésaj comienza durante el mes de Nisá (abril-mayo) y coincide con el inicio de la primavera.

En ese periodo se festeja Rosh Hashaná, o a?o Nuevo judío y es un momento dedicado a la reflexión.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yom Kipur<br>  Yom Kipur se celebra en el mes Tishei (Septiembre-Octubre); es una de las fechas más sagradas del calendario judío, ya que celebra el Día del Perdón, de la penitencia y de la purificación espiritual.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sucot y Simjat Torá<br>  La recolección de los frutos en el desierto se evoca también en el mes Tishrei, en la fiesta de los tabernáculos o Sucot. Ocho días después, se completa el ciclo anual de la lectura del Torá; este festejo es llamado Simjat Torá y significa “alegría” o “regocijo de la Torá” ambas fechas también son celebradas con alegría reverente.<br>  <br>  <br>  Janucá<br>  En el mes de Kislev (Noviembre-Diciembre), Janucá conmemora la emancipación de los judíos frente al rey Antíoco que intentaba destruir su religión y forzarlos a adoptar la fe griega.<br>  <br>  <br>  Purim y Lag Baomer<br>  Purim se presenta en el mes de Adar (Febrero-Marzo), y es una fiesta de regocijo en al que se expresa alegría por el rescate de los judíos en Persia.

Se mataba en nombre de los intereses del momento utilizando frases como "adelante Dios lo quiere". Aún hoy algunas religiones tienen corrientes que apoyan las guerras y la violencia. Movimientos violentistas como el  kuk kuk klan tienen bases religiosas, incluso apoyadas por siniestros personajes que hasta tienen influencia en la política. La utilización del nombre de Dios para cometer todo tipo de aberraciones no es nada nuevo.

Entonces elaboro ese plan de entregar a jesus para armar como una revolucion y asi poder tomar el reino, pero su plan no le resulto y pues ya sabemos lo ke paso.<br>  <br>  Esta información la puedes obtener de los evangelios apócrifos.

No hay quien no tenga algo que esconder. Se ha tergiversado el mensaje a tal punto de que se ha perdido  la capacidad de identificar al enemigo de la iglesia. Antes luchábamos contra la mundanalidad, el amor al lujo, la vanidad de la vida y hoy se predica que esos son las bendiciones que debemos alcanzar. Los pastores son admirados por sus automóviles lujosos , sus mansiones ostentosas. <br>  Creo que la actitud de este payaso es la burla mas grotesca que nos merecemos  por haber desviado el mensaje de Cristo tras la corriente del mundo.Los pastores  se han convertido en una caricatura de los ministerios de Cristo.

No debemos atemorizarnos, si has creido y recibido a Jesucristo como tu Senor y Salvador, entregandole tu vida, eres salvo.  Y como dice la Biblia "Aunque ande en valle de sombra o de muerte no temere mal alguno, porque Tu estaras conmigo" Salmo 23.

Someone who is more worried about your beliefs than your personal happiness isn't going to be able to give you a fulfilling relationship. Relationships are based on mutual respect and it sounds like he's refusing to respect your beliefs the way you respect his.<br>  <br>  There's not really a point to trying to change him, but i'd very seriously reconsider the whole relationship. I see it as the same thing as one person constantly nagging their skinny girlfriend to lose weight because he's "worried" she's getting fat. There IS no problem with you, it's his distorted world view that's getting in the way.<br>  <br>  And as for all the people here quoting bible verses: she's an ATHEIST, that means she doesn't validate your source material.

If he's the sort of Christian who worries about people going to hell, he can't in all conscience stop pestering you to go to church and get saved.  It's perfectly possible for atheists and Christians to live happily together, but in the case of this kind of Christianity something will have to give.  What's more, it's likely he'll be feeling the pressure, perhaps from his pastor, to dump you.  You could always try converting him - get him to read "Beyond Born Again", by the wonderful Robert Price, still a great Bible scholar but very much a post-Christian these days.  I don't know why I'm telling you this, I'm a Christian myself, but I'd rather you had a happy relationship than the constant battles about religion which you are likely to have unless either you start going to church or he stops.|`|RermzbWgaa	He is simply loving you.

1yTKXZdZaa	Bueno, Brasil es bastante liberal en este aspecto, pero Colombia esta adelantado una constitución gay bastante liberal y adelantada, a pesar del machismo reinante. Desde la primera reforma a la constitución ,los derechos individuales se respetan mas. Para un ejemplo, antes de la reforma de la constitución, el ejercito tenia derecho a entrar a punta pies a un bar, o a una barra y arrestar a todos allí.

La pobreza es también un gran problema de cultura, ense?anza y costumbre a través de generaciones. No soy para nada racista por el contrario, pero antes ense?emosle como hacer para no volver a caer en la pobreza, si no es por una causa mayor.

Si las personas que menos dinero tienen en el mundo tuvieran 1000 dólares, entonces se consideraría pobre a todo el que tuviera 1000 dólares o menos. <br>  <br>  Lo contrario también se cumple, hace 60 a?os sólo los ricos tenían automóviles, ahora mucha más gente tiene, por lo que ya tener automovil no es ser rico. Los automóviles baratos de ahora, además, son muchos mejores que los más caros de hace 50 a?os (tienen aire, dirección hidráulica, mejor aceleración, ahorran más combustible...)<br>  <br>  El mundo avanza y el nivel de vida de la gente avanza con él, de modo que lo que antes eran privilegios ahora son parte de la vida ordinaria, (el teléfono, la televisión, el agua potable, refrigerar los alimentos). Pero siempre hay gente que tienen un peor nivel de vida que los demás, a esos se les considera pobres. Si no, compara el ingreso y el nivel de vida de un pobre en Suiza con el de un pobre en México. Lo que en México es clase media, allá es ser pobre.<br>  <br>  Por eso NO SE PUEDE erradicar la pobreza, salvo que todos tuviéramos lo mismo, lo cuál no sólo no es justo, sino que es impracticable, porque siempre habrá personas más hábiles y trabajadoras que otras, que puedan producir más riqueza para ellos mismos. Lo que sí se puede es garantizarles a todos los pobres un nivel de vida digno, acceso a servicios médicos, educación y la posibilidad de ganarse su sustento, además de su lugar en la sociedad, donde no sean marginados. De esta forma ya ser pobre no importaría mucho.

Tiene por lo menos observando e interviniendo en la humanidad cerca de 8000 anos(sino un poco mas) La percepción Divina teológica esta por encima del bien o del mal. No es la iglesia o el diablo lo que determina lo bueno o lo malo, es el conocimiento primario o la conciencia como muchos le llaman lo que te redarguye de lo malo y te felicita por lo bueno  que hagas. Tu decides el efecto sobre tu vida de lo bueno o lo malo. Ese es el verdadero negocio que tienes que  administrar, ni la iglesia , ni satán deciden por ti; tu determinas a que lado te inclinas, al bien o al mal. No existe punto intermedio. Esto es precisamente lo que llamamos libertad de escojer; tu decides a que lado inclinas la balanza de tu vida. Dejen de culpar a Dios, a la iglesia aun al diablo; cuando gozamos de verdadera libertad para escojer(libre albedrío) Afrontemos nuestras desiciones y seamos concientes de las consecuencias de nuestros actos; nadie abogara por nosotros si nosotros no necesitamos  o no queremos ayuda.

Los de esas iglesias no hacen más que hablar de Satanás y su método para logar (según ellos) la santidad, consiste en buscar en todas las cosas al diablo, de modo que así puedan evitarlo, pero no se dan cuenta que más bien se comportan como unas personas obsesionados con Satanás. En lugar de que buscar a Jesucristo en sus vidas no hacen más que buscar a Satanás.<br>  <br>  Esa pregunta me recuerda a lo que decían los faríseos de Jesús cuando este sacaba a los demonios de las personas poseídas. Eso me da que pensar que tú crees que Satanás es tan poderoso, tan poderoso que puede destruir a la Iglesia que Jesús fundó en los apóstoles.

No matter what, we *must* believe in something, or we have nothing to live for on the morrow.  Nothing to get up out of bed for.  If we have nothing to believe in, we have nothing to care about.  If we have nothing to care about, we will (probably very slowly and very painfully) whither away.  Do I need to "justify" that belief before I get out of bed every morning???<br>  <br>  No.  I just need to believe.  In *something*.  So, either believe there "is" a "God", or there "isn't".  And *believe* that for the day.  Tomorrow you can believe something else if you want.  That's the beauty of human evolution, eh.  ;)  To believe is to be alive, in the here and now, facing reality as you know it, and being true to yourself.  We are not, as human beings, asked to do anymore than that.  Just show up and suit up.<br>  <br>  Without belief, we perish.  <br>  <br>  But we do not need "justification" to stay alive.<br>  <br>  I am Pagan (but not Wiccan) btw.|`|rsdBnRKSaa	OMG HAVNT U RED TEH BIBLE!

It's really wuite interesting, because you have no need for God. Everything seems to be going your way. . . you probably could even say that you live a well ordered life, doing the things you want to do pretty much when you want to. I'll bet its' fun. <br>  <br>  But the truth is that those people such as yourself that have no desire to come to God , and don't need him, he doesn't want either. He doesn't care about you. I'm not just telling you something to bug you, I don't even know you, but those that need God are actually better off. <br>  <br>  So the reason why you have it so good is because God doesn't care enough to tribulate you, and look, you don't care either.

El caso es que aún hoy en el siglo XXI muchos pueblos y personas continuan con esa tradición, el hecho de pensar que todos ser vivo tiene alma se llama "animismo" inclusive se aplica a objetos no vivos como por ejemplo imágenes de santos o recuerdos familiares como fotos, o acaso ?no le dan nombre a objetos como automóviles?, conozco varias amistades que le dan nombre a sus autos no sólo a sus perros o mascotas y cuando se refieren a ellos lo dicen como si hablaran de una persona. El caso es que el alma de seres vivos o no vivos existe si tú crees que existe, todo depende de tus ideas o religión, o  ?quién puede demostrar que el alma existe?, ?quién puede demostrar que el alma no existe?.<br>  Cómo decía San Agustín cuando le argumentaban que la Verdad no existe: "Si es verdad que la Verdad no existe luego entonces la Verdad existe"|`|Y6QGasagaa	Los animales sienten, todo ser viviente siente pero no todos pueden expresar su sentimiento.-creo que si tienen alma pero al morir el cuerpo tambien muere su alma|`|jHKlULDMaa	Asi es, todo ser vivo tiene alma, las plantas tienen alma vegetal,  los animales (incluido el ser humano) tenemos alma animal, pero solamente los seres humanos tenemos espíritu.|`|GKScd5FLaa	No solamente los hombres y los animales.<br>  Dice Dios;<br>  Todas las almas son mias.asi de hombres como de animales."<br>  Biblico.|`|1sOkZC2oaa	No, para mí.<br>  Todavía se discute la cuestión del alma, en el campo de la Electroneurología.<br>  Jakob, Carrillo y Moyano -s XX- se ocuparon mucho del tema y se refirieron a la diferenciación entre "vida" y "psiquismo".<br>  El ejemplo sería que, si bien una cebolla existe, se puede ver sobre una mesa y tocarse, no tiene contenido mental.<br>  Cuando Aristóles quería fundar la Biología, aunó criterios para simplificar e incluyó entre los seres vivos, a los animales y a las plantas. <br>  Y su teoría fue esgrimida por científicos y religiosos, que la fueron acomodando a sus necesidades.<br>  Eso no iguala en alma, ni en capacidades, a todas las especies.<br>  Los seres superiores se diferencian del resto, por tener una mayor capacidad de adaptación (que los ha hecho evolucionar y perpetuarse a través de millones de a?os), contenidos mentales, raciocinio y vínculos afectivos muy desarrollados.<br>  Esto no se advierte en los animales, ni en las plantas, ni en las bacterias.|`|M3V39s13aa	si todo ser viviente tiene alma en lo unico en que varia es la conceptualidad abstracta en cada uno, un alma encarnada en una planta no tiene el pensamiento abstracto que un alma encarnada en un organismo como en el de nosotros, tenemos el pensamiento mas desarrollado|`|YFUbhBxRaa	no creo, pero con eso de que de repente sale cada cosa dudalo que halla alguna religion, o alguna corriente que diga que si|`|cRUBIROHaa	SI, TODO SER VIVO TIENE ALMA PORQUE FUE CREADO POR DIOS, TODO TIENE UNA INTELIGENCIA SUPERIOR QUE HACE QUE SE MUEVA, SE ALIMENTE, VIBRE EN COLOR, EN COMUNIDAD CON SUS SEMEJANTES.

LO MISMO QUE UN ARBOL, QUE CUANDO HAY UN INCENDIO, POR EJEMPLO, BUSCA ALGUN RASTRO DE LUZ PARA QUE SALGA ALGUN BROTE NUEVO.<br>  SI, YO SE QUE DIOS CREO CADA CRIATURA Y LE DIO ALMA E INTELIGENCIA. TODO ES PERFECTO.|`|xzjUMP4Maa	Hola! Alma solo tienen los hombres y mujeres, los demás seres vivientes solo tienen vida física, no espiritual que es la forma en que como seres humanos nos comunicamos con Dios, y es el espíritu el que al morir se queda en nuestro cuerpo mientras que el alma se desprende del mismo para presentarse ante Dios como un libro abierto en el que se han escrito nuestros actos y a través de los cuales el Se?or nos juzgará.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

I am not Christian, and therefore do not worship the Christian God, or read the Christian texts or live a Christian lifestyle, but I have this strange feeling with the bible. Have you ever read a part of it, and had it not tie in with something else, or have you ever had a question about the bible that you couldn't find the answer to in the bible? It's hard, and I've never found anything in the bible that can't be backed up by another event written in it. It's either the world's best written book, or true, because the questions brought up from it always seem to have the answer within it.|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	I don't think it is so much exaggerated as misinterpreted by Christians. Only by studying the history of the earth both in human activity and geographically can one get the full picture. For instance the flood appears to be 'over the top' but in every society there is a story about the flood...and scientist geologists have found evidence that this massive flood happened. Look up 'The black sea flood' on the web and read the reviews and studies.  Apparently it happened when early man had begun to spread out  and  not only caused many to perish but also scattered men across the earth - which is probably why so many cultures have this story that has come down through the generations.  It says in the bible that the whole world was flooded - in essence I think that it would have appeared to many that the world they knew was flooded as it was a massive Tsunami like event.  It is always a good idea to read the bible in the era and context in which it is written. Also it was so called men of learning who decided what went into the new testement.  Mary Magdelene for instance wrote a book that was never put into the bible - women were not considered suitable to be in a place of leadership - yet in may places in the new testemant Paul gives credit to women who prophesied and also ran their little groups of Christians.  If you broaden you studies I think you will be amazed and pleasantly surprised at what you can find out.  It is believed that Moses - being raised as an Egyption would have been taught to read and write and therefore able to leave a record of his time.  Lots of exciting stuff out there if you search for it.  Also look up where Abraham came from..it's now part of Iraq. Bless you in your search.|`|AxQmd4flaa	Your claim about God doing miracles for you is about as exaggerated and untrue as the Bible is. <br>  <br>  But you wont admit that, will you?|`|6jAVElX7aa	what do you mean you are a christian?  Like attending church regularly, giving lip service, but your heart is far from the Lord?  christian means to follow christ and following Christ means following Him to the cross, where He gave His life to bear the wrath of God for us sinners. Try to read the Bible with asking the Lord to open your mind and heart to His Word in a humble spirit|`|FvoxgjbJaa	I believe in the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church, founded by Jesus Christ when He said: <br>  <br>  "And I say to thee: That thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be bound also in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven."<br>  <br>  Further Christ said:<br>  <br>  "He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me."<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church is the owner of the Holy Bible.

Everybody believes in it.<br>  <br>  <br>  If God exists, what can possibly be exaggerated?|`|1TYZDRUqaa	No.|`|s5XNGbOMaa	Much of the translation from the original Hebrew in the Old Testament into the Bible we know today is incredibly skewed -and in many cases- grossly exaggerated. A majority of the ancient text has holes, or is almost completely destroyed. One question we must ask is: who compiled our modern Bible, and what motivations did they have to compile it the way they did. Why were certain books left out over others? Man compiled the Bible, and Man is imperfect and have many alterior motives. I do not trust it to be entirely the word of God.|`|oi6eHkPzaa	I wrestled with this question myself, when i was younger. I should tell you i am a hopeful agnostic, but i hope you won't hold it against me? In the end, the bible contains a great deal of good advice, and alot of, frankly, spurious fantasising. Remember, when it was written, people still believed that the earth was flat. Many things have changed, and it was written by normal people like you and i. I just try to take the parts which basically advise you to be a decent, kind person and stick to that. Btw, good on you for thinking for yourself:) God is different for everyone, there is no right or wrong, and surely a benevolent God would understand this?|`|uQHHVI8Zaa	nope, not untrue not exaggerated.<br>  <br>  the Bible is the Truth, everything is True.<br>  <br>  + it seems hard to believe to you, cuz WE ARE just human, Jesus is SO much more than that, WE cant perform those miracles soo we take it as fake sometimes because we aren't able to do or perform miracles or anything that Jesus has done.|`|zD0lCK5Kaa	Yes I believe in the Bible. Everything that God had written for man are in the Bible. It is a complete book that God had made for man whose life He has to complete at the second coming of His Son Jesus Christ any day and hour within our times. You have to believe it to be true. It is your protection against Satan whose purpose is to blind your mind not to see the truth and the joy of being with God. It is not exaggerated. You can take its prophecies into history. If you believe in God you have to believe in His words.|`|d5KW3h0Iaa	yes because more then once I have opened up the bible to no certain page and just read and after finishing reading I have been comforted and found the answer I was looking for.|`|LQsh261waa	Yes it is all true, Jesus believed so as well."Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth".John 17:17|`|JjoBtLjbaa	The Bible is undoubtedly fictitious.|`|0VbAMZccaa	NO<br>  <br>  do you believe in harry potter, the boogie man, freddy cougar, or a time travel machine???|`|jOwH96wKaa	Do you believe that Lord of the Rings is evidence for middle earth?|`|zefFTf8Aaa	no. our minds limit our understanding.   as a Catholic, I believe 100% of the bible.|`|tuOe65Pcaa	The problem is that according to the Christians: The Bible is word of God.|`|a7Zu52jFaa	I have seen it around before - yes, I think the Bible exists.|`|AsBgZDhVaa	NO!|`|WR8eKYzfaa	No.|`|7ko9czaaaa	how can you say you beleave in god and not the bible, that is his book it tells us about him.|`|iS5LwpY5aa	No, I've never seen one and I don't think it exists.|`|RLuKYc2laa	I believe everything in the bible.<br>  <br>  Check out this website:   <a href="http://www.goodseed.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodseed.com/</a> <br>  <br>  Also, "The case for a creator" by Lee Strobel is a good book.|`|PafAZ66Haa	I believe in the bible but alot of it was the stylistic, figurative language style of writing. if you really want to know do some research|`|4lG5zBc5aa	Yes, I do believe there is a book called the Bible.

(una manera de protegerse es mantener una pareja estable).<br>  En el caso de las mujeres, también implica realizarse los estudios médicos correspondientes.<br>  También se debe tener en cuenta el tipo de prácticas sexuales realizadas. El preservativo evita el contagio de enfermedades de transmisión sexual, como por ejemplo, el sida (vía penetración), pero mucha gente no sabe que practicar sexo oral a una persona infectada, también te infecta.<br>  Espero haberme explicado.|`|1cac3c86004a3531466c894a4b461a02aa	El preservativo es una. una educación idónea, un matrimonio, un menor sexo desordenado e impulsivo o desenfrenado son parte de la realidad de esta temática, en donde opino la madurez es esencial, ya que la vida no solo debe centrarse en lo que se siente, en impulsos...el sexo es más que eso....|`|dxODiUIVaa	no se limita a eso pero si es una parte muy importante, el uso del condón es indispensable incluso en parejas establecidas porque uno nunca sabe, tu puedes creer que tu pareja te es muy fiel pero, y que tal si no es asi?????????|`|faf6838c32f007a9fc6ad7d199438d78aa	porsupuesto que no se limita a usar condon pero sin duda es un buen comienzo|`|4e75d3135d7ad22a0eb99eb24e54b036aa	Si, no solo es usar condon, es serle fiel a tu pareja, y tambien cuidarse con otros tipos de anticonceptivos, en la actualidad existen muchos y cada quien puede elegir cual es el k mejor le conviene.|`|5JdBZf5Uaa	No, no solo se limita a eso, el sexo es un don que se disfruta plenamente cuando está sustentado en un compromiso :El matrimonio<br>  <br>  sexo con condon pero sin compromiso es vivir tu sexualidad como la viven algunos animales p.e. los perros, aunque creo que ellos razonan mejor su comportamiento que los humanos, ya que no tienen la capacidad de presumir de cantidades, desempe?os, o destruir reputaciones!<br>  <br>  Hasta luego|`|5le71TLHaa	no solo es usar condon...es tener valores, responsabilidad, sobre todo amar a uno mismo para poder amar a tu pareja,respetar nuestro cuerpo..son muchas cosas|`|AXztx5pCaa	La sexualidad no es solo acostarse, también el sexo oral, darse un beso, ... es una relación sexual en el que puede haber transmisión.

Hay un refrán que dice; nunca te acostarás sin saber una cosa más y yo,  no sabía que a los gays les ocurría lo mismo, no pueden tener una amistad sana sin tirar los trastos.

Algunas sectas anulan a sus adeptos, otras los manipulan (para bien o mal), otras incluso los destruyen.<br>  <br>  Por ejemplo, en el caso de los Testigos de Jehová la mayoría de sus miembros se mantienen controlados por los dogmas y directrices que envían sus líderes representados por la Sociedad Watchtower (empresa editorial que redacta y publica las doctrinas que los TJ estudian y distribuyen a través de los millones de ejemplares de sus revistas que se imprimen todos los meses).<br>  <br>  Mucha de esta información los lleva a excluirse socialmente, los ilusiona con perspectivas de gratificación cercana -casi inmediata- de un paraíso prometido en la Tierra, lo que los lleva a estar dispuestos a dar la vida o dejar morir a sus hijos en caso de que sus creencias y las circunstancias se lo exigan (como en el caso de las transfusiones de sangre).<br>  <br>  ?Será beneficioso todo eso?<br>  <br>  Si deseas tener una opinión acerca de lo que son las sectas y sus técnicas de manipulación, te recomiendo visites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.about-sects-and-cults.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.about-sects-and-cults.org</a><br>  (Sitio en espa?ol, muy interesante)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sectas.cmact.com/salida/salida_03.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sectas.cmact.com/salida/salida_03...</a><br>  (Síntomas que permiten detectar a una secta)<br>  <br>  Para diferenciarse de las personas los TJ evitan todo trato social con quienes no pertenezcan al movimiento, excepto para predicarles. <br>  <br>  Siguen estrictamente las instrucciones que les entrega un grupo formado por alrededor de 10 a 12 miembros autonombrados, que se les denomina Cuerpo Gobernante. Esta obediencia estricta, so pena de excomunión, se debe a que Jesucristo los habría escogido desde 1918. Por lo tanto, para un TJ desobedecer al Cuerpo Gobernante es como desobedecer a Jesucristo.<br>  <br>  Entre las normas que siguen y que corresponden a mandatos de este Cuerpo Gobernante están:<br>  <br>  - Informar la cantidad de horas predicadas y las publicaciones dejadas a las personas.<br>  - No celebrar cumplea?os <br>  - No celebrar día de la madre, del padre, de los abuelos, de los amigos<br>  - No hacer brindis<br>  - No tener amistades fuera de los TJ<br>  - No utilizar barba<br>  - Que los jóvenes no vayan a la Universidad<br>  - No aceptar transfusiones de sangre, ni para los adultos ni para los ni?os. Hoy se han abierto a que algunos acepten fracciones de la sangre en una cirugía. Incluso en Bulgaria aceptaron no sancionar religiosamente (excomulgar) a quien reciba una transfusión completa, lo que les permitió operar legalmente como entidad religiosa.<br>  - Etc.<br>  <br>  Es muy probable que frente a una nueva norma de este Cuerpo Gobernante ningún TJ sienta el valor de contradecirla públicamente por la amenaza de excomunión.<br>  <br>  Esta excomunión implica que la persona pierda todo contacto social con quienes fueron sus amigos, familiares y conocidos que participen con los TJ. En la práctica, si la persona está poco preparada y no tiene más amistades fuera del grupo (como se les ha instruido) puede terminar alienado y requerirá indispensablemen apoyo psicológico profesional para rehacer su vida.<br>  <br>  Hay que destacar como aspecto positivo que muchos TJ llevan vidas decentes, algunos son bien preparados, sin embargo están dominados (muchos sin darse cuenta) por los intereses de la Sociedad Watchtower (quien edita las revistas y libros de los TJ).<br>  <br>  Como se ha se?alado en otras consultas, esta empresa editorial imprime importantes volúmenes de material escrito en diversos idiomas. Dichas publicaciones son financiadas por los propios TJ con aportes voluntarios, además se pide a las personas visitadas que financien a la Watchtower con sus propios aportes. Las economías de escala que permite la producción masiva hace que el costo de los artículos impresos sea ínfimo y los aportes más que financian a la Editorial.<br>  <br>  De hecho, lo anterior les permite la compra de grandes imprentas, muchos inmuebles alrededor del mundo (los que son pagados por los propios TJ con créditos blandos) y financiar a sus representantes (han invertido en este último ítem alrededor de MMUS$ 100 en el último a?o, según sus propias declaraciones).<br>  <br>  Lo anterior se traduce, para un TJ común y corriente, que todos los meses están con "campa?as" "ofertas" de distintas publicaciones, deben informar permanentemente su "actividad" (cuántas horas "predicaron", cuántos libros y revistas dejaron a las personas, cuántos conversos están haciendo, cuántas veces les visitan). Si no entregan sus reportes se les comienza a considerar como poco espirituales y se menozcaba su dignidad (recientemente se abrieron a que las personas mayores y enfermas entreguen un reporte de 15 minutos dedicados a hablar con otros). Algunos han sufrido depresiones y stress (debido a que también deben atender a sus familias y empleos).<br>  <br>  Además, se les "sugiere" a los jóvenes que no estudien carreras de nivel superior (por ej. universitarias), sino más bien se dediquen a trabajar en sus imprentas o construyendo iglesias (Salones) de manera voluntaria a favor de la Sociedad Watchtower. El problema es que cuando ese joven decide casarse probablemente quede fuera del mercado laboral por no tener preparación suficiente. <br>  <br>  Al mismo tiempo, a los matrimonios jóvenes les "sugieren" que no tengan hijos para que se dediquen a la "predicación" o a construir salones.<br>  <br>  Muchos que no toman estas decisiones pueden llegar a ser considerados como "poco espirituales" o incluso como "materialistas". Todo lo anterior, menozcaba la dignidad y la autoestima de muchos de ellos, y los que se acomodan a este esquema no entienden sus pensamientos depresivos, pese a lo cual están dispuestos a hacer este trabajo voluntario en busca de una buena relación con Dios y por cierto, la salvación.<br>  <br>  ?Los TJ ense?arán cosas falsas o verdaderas? ?Los Tj serán una secta? ?Qué tiene que ver esto con lo que predicó Jesucristo y sus apóstoles?

(Hechos 7:51-53; 1 Tesalonicenses 4:8; compárese con Isaías 30:1,2) Una persona puede hipócritamente "tratar con enga?o" al espíritu santo por medio del cual Cristo dirige a la congregación, pero aquellos que "ponen a prueba" su poder de esta manera escogen un proceder desastroso. (Hechos 5:1-11; contrátese con Romanos 9:1) La oposición y la rebelión deliberada contra la manifestación evidente del espíritu de Dios puede significar blasfemia contra ese espíritu, un pecado imperdonable.

If you are saying that  because the bible says it's wrong does that mean homosexuals can't be Christians. Than you are mistaken Homosexuals are as loved by god as much as we are. God excepts the greedy into heaven does he not the verse that says it is wrong also mentions greedy people does that mean we should have laws banning greedy people from having money? Homosexuals can follow Christ just like you or I can. Or they can be Jewish. Or Muslim. It is not their choice to be homosexual the majority of the time. It is some thing you are born with.

Una de ellas cuenta que *gringo* habría surgido del sistema de se?ales de los trenes ingleses, cuando éstos fueron instalados en México, en particular, de la luz verde, que indicaba que el paso estaba abierto: **green go** (verde, ir).<br>  Sin embargo, *gringo* es una antigua palabra espa?ola. Veamos cómo la define el diccionario académico (1884):<br>  <br>  Gringo - Voz usada familiarmente. Vale tanto como griego en esta frase: hablar en gringo. Hacerlo en un lenguaje ininteligible.<br>  <br>  Antiguamente existía la costumbre de mencionar las locuciones latinas junto con su forma en griego, hasta que en cierta época la Iglesia católica determinó que la comprensión del griego no era necesaria para la erudición católica. A partir de ese momento, fue considerado un idioma extra?o y, como tal, se convirtió en símbolo de cualquier habla incomprensible.<br>  <br>  En el diccionario de Esteban de Terreros (1765-83) se explica que ?gringos llaman en Málaga a los extranjeros, que tienen cierta especie de acento, que los priva de una locución fácil y natural castellana, y en Madrid dan el mismo nombre con particularidad a los irlandeses?.<br>  En América el vocablo se popularizó con variantes: en México es usado casi exclusivamente para referirse a los estadounidenses; en la Argentina se aplicó en la primera mitad del siglo xx a los italianos, aunque actualmente se tiende a usarlo para denominar también a los norteamericanos.<br>  Según Corominas, la alteración fonética de “griego” a “gringo” se habría procesado en dos tiempos: primero, de *griego* a *grigo*, una reducción normal en castellano y más tarde, de *grigo* a *gr|`|61BpCTu3aa	Varias versiones sobre el origen del término, el cual ya se usaba desde 1600-1700 para los angloparlantes del norte y que hoy son EEUU y culminan con la popularización de dicho término en las guerras entre estadounidenses y mexicanos que terminaron con la independencia de Texas primero y la anexión de gran parte del territorio mexicano por los Estados Unidos, luego. Esas versiones provienen de:<br>  <br>  La Batalla de El álamo, Texas en 1836, los mexicanos les gritaban GREENS GO (verdes, váyanse) debido a que el ejército estadounidense vestía uniforme verde , Green Go! (gringo) se quedó en el lenguaje mexicano. <br>  Durante la guerra México-estadounidense de 1845-1847 los soldados estadounidenses que invadieron México, cantaban una canción llamada "verdes crecen las lilas" en inglés 'Green Grow the Lilacs' de allí proviene la palabra gringo como una deformación de esa oración. <br>  Los batallones de Estados Unidos se identificaban por medio de colores. Así pues, existía el batallón "blue", el "red", el "green", etc. En el campo de batalla el comandante del batallón verde gritaba "GREEN GO", "GREEN GO", "GREEN GO", exigiendo a su batallón que avanzara. Los mexicanos imitaron burlonamente el grito del comandante y le dieron el sobrenombre de "GRINGO" a sus enemigos. <br>  Otra teoría similar es que los batallones se identificaban con colores y el "green" era el designado para la frontera con méxico. Los batallones no se llamaban simplemente "red" o "blue" sino "red coats" o "blue coats" (casacas rojas, casacas azules) y en el caso de los q más se conocían en méxico (los verdes) "green coats". Los mexicanos como burla en vez de pronunciar "grin couts" decían "grin gos" o "grin gous".<br>  También se dice que varios vaqueros y ganaderos estadounidenses buscan un mejor pasto verde para su ganado vacuno y caballar y cruzaban la frontera en dirección a México y decían a los lugare?os del lugar donde había pasto verde (green Grass) para su ganado pero algunos mexicanos burlonamente le decían gringos. <br>  Al sudoeste de la zona de Texas, un poblado vecino a la planta nuclear de Durenville, sufrio la contaminaciòn de las napas subterranes de abastecimineto de agua de pozo, debido a esto, y al posteriormente ingerir esta agua contaminada, los habitantes sufrieron una leve coloracion en la piel de color verde. Estas personas "coloreadas" sufrieron la discriminacion interna de los mismos habitantes con los que convivian. Las paredes eran escritas con mensajes del tipo: "Gente verde no queremos" ("We don`t want green people") o "Verdes vayanse de este lugar" ("Greens goes to other place"). De esta ultima la abreviaciòn "Green goes" (foneticamente gringos). A causa de esta discriminaciòn a la gente de color verde, John Michael Sherman, T.G.G o T.Gs ("The great green") para los pobladores verdes, se organizò junto con otros vecinos en la "Federaciòn para la proteccion de los derechos verdes" ("Greens rights protection federation)".|`|8gILt1lvaa	simon, no me acuerdo cual, pero les decian gringos por qe gritaban asi  green gooooo!!<br>  <br>  osea se qe es una mamada , pero suena logiko jajajaa

aBllCVGxaa	Colaboración de Juan M. Ballesteros <br>  25 de Diciembre<br>  y las fiestas paganas <br>  El día de Navidad es el 25 de diciembre, cuando se conmemora el Nacimiento de Jesucristo en Belén según los evangelios de San Mateo y San Lucas. Después de la Pascua de Resurrección es la fiesta más importante del a?o eclesiástico. <br>  <br>  Como los evangelios no mencionan fechas, no es seguro que Jesús naciera ese día. De hecho, el día de Navidad no fue oficialmente reconocido hasta el a?o 345, cuando por influencia de San Juan Crisóstomo y San Gregorio Nacianzeno se proclamó el 25 de diciembre como fecha de la Natividad. <br>  <br>  De esta manera seguía la política de la Iglesia primitiva de absorber en lugar de reprimir los ritos paganos existentes, que desde los primeros tiempos habían celebrado el solsticio de invierno y la llegada de la primavera. <br>  <br>  La fiesta pagana más estrechamente asociada con la nueva Navidad era el Saturnal romano, el 19 de diciembre, en honor de Saturno, dios de la agricultura, que se celebraba durante siete días de bulliciosas diversiones y banquetes. <br>  <br>   Al mismo tiempo, se celebraba en el Norte de Europa una fiesta de invierno similar, conocida como Yule, en la que se quemaban grandes troncos adornados con ramas y cintas en honor de los dioses para conseguir que el Sol brillara con más fuerza. <br>  <br>  <br>  Edad Media,<br>  nacimientos y villancicos <br>  Una vez incorporados estos elementos, la Iglesia a?adió posteriormente en la Edad Media el nacimiento y los villancicos a sus costumbres. En esta época, los banquetes eran el punto culminante de las celebraciones. Todo esto tuvo un abrupto final en Gran Breta?a cuando, en 1552, los puritanos prohibieron la Navidad. Aunque la Navidad volvió a Inglaterra en 1660 con Carlos II, los rituales desaparecieron hasta la época victoriana. <br>  <br>  <br>  La Navidad, tal como la conocemos hoy, es una creación del siglo XIX. El árbol de navidad, originario de zonas germanas, se extendió por otras áreas de Europa y América. Los villancicos fueron recuperados y se compusieron muchos nuevos (la costumbre de cantar villancicos, aunque de antiguos orígenes, procede fundamentalmente del siglo XIX). Las tarjetas de navidad no empezaron a utilizarse hasta la década de 1870, aunque la primera de ellas se imprimió en Londres en 1846. <br>  <br>  Santa Claus y<br>  el Espíritu de Navidad <br>  La familiar imagen de Santa Claus, con el trineo, los renos y las bolsas con juguetes, es una invención estadounidense de estos a?os, aunque la leyenda de Papá Noel sea antigua y compleja, y proceda en parte de San Nicolás y una jovial figura medieval, el espíritu de navidad. En Rusia lleva tradicionalmente un cochinillo rosa bajo el brazo. <br>  Navidad<br>  hoy día <br>  Actualmente, la Navidad es tiempo de gran actividad comercial e intercambio de regalos, reuniones y comidas familiares. <br>  En Occidente se celebra la Misa del gallo en iglesias y catedrales. En los países de América Latina, de arraigada tradición católica, se celebra especialmente la Nochebuena (24 de diciembre) con una cena familiar para la que se elaboran una diversidad de platos, postres y bebidas tradicionales. <br>  <br>  También se acostumbra asistir a la Misa del gallo y celebrar con cohetes y fuegos artificiales. <br>    <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Lo que dicen las enciclopedias<br>  enviado por Concepción Garay S.<br>  La palabra "navidad" es una contracción de "natividad", que significa natalicio. Esta fiesta hizo su aparición en la Iglesia Católica y de allí se extendió al protestantismo y al resto del mundo.<br>  <br>  Ahora bien, de donde la recibió la Iglesia Católica? No fue de las ense?anzas del Nuevo Testamento. No fue de la Biblia ni de los apóstoles quienes habían sido instruidos personalmente por Jesucristo. La Navidad se introdujo en la Iglesia durante el siglo cuarto, proveniente del paganismo.<br>  <br>  Puesto que la celebración de la Navidad fue introducida en el mundo por la Iglesia Católica Romana y no tiene otra autoridad que la de ella misma, veamos lo que dice al respecto la Enciclopedia Católica (edicion de 1911): "La Navidad no estaba incluida entre las primeras festividades de la Iglesia... los<br>  primeros indicios de ella provienen de Egipto... Las costumbres paganas relacionadas con el principio de enero se centraron en la fiesta de la Navidad.<br>  <br>  En la misma enciclopedia, bajo "Día Natal", encontramos que Orígenes, uno de los padres de la Iglesia, reconoció la siguiente verdad: "...No vemos en<br>  las Escrituras que nadie haya guardado una fiesta ni celebrado un gran banquete el día de su natalicio. Solo los pecadores (como Faaraon y Herodes) celebraban con gran regocijo el día en que nacieron en este mundo". <br>  <br>  . La Pascua, instituida por<br>  autoridad bíblica en el Nuevo Testamento, es una conmemoración de la muerte de Cristo. En el siglo quinto, la Iglesia Occidental dio orden de que fuese celebrada para siempre, en el mismo día de la antigua festividad romana en honor del nacimiento del sol, ya que no se conocía la fecha exacta del nacimiento de Cristo".<br>  <br>  Estas autoridades históricas demuestran que durante los primeros dos o tres siglos de nuestra era, los cristianos no celebraban la Navidad. Esta fiesta fue introducida en la Iglesia Romana en el siglo cuarto de nuestra era y no fue hasta el siglo quinto que la establecieron oficialmente como fiesta cristiana.<br>  <br>  Cualquier enciclopedia u otra autoridad nos puede confirmar el hecho de que Cristo no nació un 25 de diciembre. La enciclopedia Católica lo dice claramente.<br>  <br>  La fecha exacta del nacimiento de Jesucristo es totalmente desconocida. Las sagradas escrituras no revelan este acontecimiento.<br>  <br>  La nueva enciclopedia de conocimiento religioso, de Schaff-Herzog, lo explica claramente en su artículo sobre la Navidad: "No puede determinarse con precisión hasta que punto la fecha de de esta festividad dependió de la pagana Brumalia (25 de diciembre), que seguía a la Saturnalia (17-24) de diciembre y conmemoraba el día más corto del a?o y el nuevo sol.<br>  <br>  Para más referencias podrías recopilar más datos en la Enciclopedia Británica, edición 11, volumen 19, páginas 648-649 acerca del origen de San Nicolás. También en Biblioteca Sacra, volumen 12, páginas 153-155 referente a la tradición de intercambio de regalos, característico de la Saturnalia.<br>  <br>  Por el momento es todo en lo que puedo colaborar, de todas formas escríbeme y te contestaré con mucho gusto.<br>  <br>  Concepción Garay S.|`|6Rjr1dIzaa	.La navidad tiene su orígenes en las festividades romanas de las llamadas "saturninas romanas"en honor a Saturno y el sol,ya que los romanos se convirtieron a cristianos en el 325 E.C el entonces emperador Constantino ordenó que todos su seguidos se convirtieran al cristianismo y cambiase sus fiestas por las cristianas,de hay surgierón la nueva fecha del nacimiento de cristo colocando estas en el 24 de diciembre como la lo conocemos,pero su orígenes no son cristianas sino mas bien paganos como se puede demostrar con la historia.

Algunas culturas creían que el dios del sol nació el 21 de diciembre, el día más corto del a?o, y que los días se hacían más largos a medida que el dios se hacía más viejo. En otras culturas se creía que el dios del sol murió ese día, sólo para volver a otro ciclo.<br>  <br>  Los romanos celebraban el 25 de diciembre la fiesta del "Natalis Solis Invicti" o "Nacimiento del Sol invicto". Asociada al nacimiento de Apolo. El 25 de diciembre fue considerado como día del solsticio de invierno, y que los romanos llamaron bruma; cuando Julio César introdujo su calendario en el a?o 45 a.C., el 25 de diciembre debió ubicarse entre el 21 y 22 de diciembre de nuestro Calendario Gregoriano. <br>  De esta fiesta, los primeros cristianos tomaron la idea del 25 de diciembre como fecha del nacimiento de Jesucristo. <br>  <br>  Otro festival romano llamado Saturnalia, en honor a Saturno, duraba cerca de siete días e incluía el solsticio de invierno. Por esta celebración los romanos posponían todos los negocios y guerras, había intercambio de regalos, y liberaban temporalmente a sus esclavos. Tales tradiciones se asemejan a las actuales tradiciones de Navidad y se utilizan para establecer un acoplamiento entre los dos días de fiesta.<br>  <br>  Según la Enciclopedia Católica, la Navidad no está incluida en la lista de festividades cristianas de Ireneo ni en la lista de Tertuliano acerca del mismo tema, las cuales son las listas más antiguas que se conocen. Orígenes, incluso se opuso a celebrar los nacimientos diciendo:<br>  "No vemos en las Escrituras que nadie haya guardado una fiesta ni celebrado un gran banquete el día de su natalicio. Solo los pecadores (como el Faraón y Herodes) celebraban con gran regocijo el día en que nacieron en este mundo".<br>  <br>  La evidencia más temprana de la preocupación por la fecha de la Navidad se encuentra en Alejandría, cerca del a?o 200 de nuestra era, cuando Clemente de Alejandría indica que ciertos teólogos egipcios “muy curiosos” asignan no sólo el a?o sino también el día real del nacimiento de Cristo como 25 pachon (20 de mayo) en el vigésimo octavo a?o de Augusto. Desde 221, en la obra Chronographiai, Sexto Julio Africano popularizó el 25 de diciembre como la fecha del nacimiento de Jesús. Para la época del Concilio de Nicea en 325, la Iglesia Alejandrina ya había fijado el Díes nativitatis et epifaníae.<br>  <br>  El papa Julio I pidió en el 350 que el nacimiento de Cristo fuera celebrado el 25 de diciembre, lo cual fue decretado por el papa Liberio en 354.|`|hRNpFuufaa	Pienso yo (y no solo yo) que el origen está en las Vacanales romanas, es lógico pensar que cuando el imperio acató la religión cristiana se adaptaran las fiestas, pero no creo que esto le reste importancia ni haga de las navidades una ridiculez. <br>  <br>  Nuestra cultura es compleja y mixta y nuestras costumbres son mezcla de todas las civilizaciones que nos preceden...según como lo quieras ver, no creo que este origen pagano reste dignidad a estas fiestas, incluso si no eres religioso, puedes verlo como una cuestión de costumbres.|`|opuGWWNEaa	El origen de la Navidad con mayúscula, no es sino el nacimiento de Jesús, de Dios que se hizo hombre y el cual se entregó, padeció, murió y resucitó por nosotros.

Why do we give Dawah to non-believers? arent we helping them by giving Dawah to them?<br>  <br>  3) Why did Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) help his Jewish neighbour, and what about the countless other stories about Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)'s kindness and tolerance for non muslims? Helping Kafirs or misguided people understand Islam by soft-spoken kindness, love and generosity is Sunnah BTW.

As commonly conceived, He has both the will and the means to realize human salvation, but does so only for those whom He and the angels decide are worthy of everlasting life in heaven. This conditional concept of salvation is dominant, but has a wide variety of theological interpretations ranging from universal salvation (ie. near-absolute salvation) to quite narrow and particular concepts —such that tend to assert a "one true path [to salvation]."<br>  <br>  The purpose of salvation is also debated (cf. purpose of life), but in general most theologians agree that God wants human salvation because He regards human beings as his children, and as such loves them. Because human existence on Earth is "[given] to sin" (John 8:34), salvation also has connotations that deal with the liberation of human beings from sin, and therefore also the inevitable suffering associated with the punishment of sin (ie. "the wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23).<br>  <br>  The means of salvation are not well defined or understood. The soul, typically described as "the essence of a [human] being," is thought to be transcendent and thus indicates a substantive link between human existence in a mortal human body, and eternal life as an angel. Whether the soul becomes an angel by nature, or requires an action by God is also not clearly defined in either scripture or commentary.<br>  <br>  The theological study of salvation is called soteriology: it covers the means by which salvation is effected or achieved, and its results or effects. Salvation may also be called "deliverance", as in "being delivered" or saved, or "redemption," as in being redeemed or healed [of sin].|`|aGRJ6MPdaa	You can't earn it, but you can lose it. Salvation is a free gift. You can accept it, and then return it, just like any other gift. It doesn't "stick" to you once you accept it, and no one can force you to accept a gift. If it was forced, then it wouldn't be a gift! <br>  <br>  God gave us free will, and that means that we can accept His gift, but then later discard it. The choice is OURS, individually.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Can a Believer "Lose" His Salvation?<br>  <br>  Or Stated More Accurately, Can He Forfeit It?<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  "Has God indeed said...Those on the rocky soil are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no firm root; they believe for a while, and in time of temptation fall away."? (Luke 8:13)<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Summary<br>  <br>  the scripture clearly teaches BOTH the sovereignty of God AND the free will of men.  To deny this is irrational, and must be caused by something other than reason based on scriptural precepts.<br>  <br>  The scriptural position is that a person who is saved can forfeit that salvation.  The bible teaches those at highest risk of forfeiting their salvation are those who are newly saved, and those who continue on in known disobedience, after being born again.<br>  <br>  The elect are those whom God chose, whom God foresaw would both trust in His Son AND who would endure or persevere in the faith given them until the end of their physical life, or the return of Jesus.<br>  <br>  Those whose hearts are seeking the Lord with all that is in them, should have no concern about "losing" their salvation.  Nor should they have any concern about forfeiting their salvation.  <br>  <br>  Salvation cannot be lost, but it can be forfeited - this is the nature of covenants in the bible.  The bible no where guarantee's someone that salvation once received cannot be turned away from or forfeited by the individual that possesses it.<br>  <br>  Receiving salvation involves man's will, and not works.  Forfeiting salvation involves man's will, and not works.   In the same way the Lord did not force His salvation on anyone, He neither forces anyone to remain in the covenant.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jesusfamilies.org/Articles/ForfeitSalvation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jesusfamilies.org/Articles/Fo...</a>|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	You can obtain it by turning your life over to Jesus and accept His free gift of salvation.

Because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be haughty, but fear.  For if God did not spare the natural branches, He may not spare you either.  Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in His goodness.

You need milk, not solid food! 13Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. 14But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.<br>  <br>      1Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death,[a] and of faith in God, 2instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. 3And God permitting, we will do so.<br>  <br>      4It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, 5who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age, 6if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance, because[b]to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.<br>  <br>      7Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God. 8But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned.<br>  <br>      9Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are confident of better things in your case—things that accompany salvation. 10God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them. 11We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to make your hope sure. 12We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.<br>  <br>  EDIT: And Read James 2:14-26<br>  <br>  Faith and Deeds<br>  <br>      14What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? 15Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. 16If one of you says to him, "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? 17In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.<br>  <br>      18But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds."<br>        Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.<br>  <br>      19You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.<br>  <br>      20You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless[d]? 21Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? 22You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. 23And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,"[e] and he was called God's friend. 24You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.<br>  <br>      25In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? 26As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.|`|PafAZ66Haa	you cannot earn salvation but you must know jesus. you also cannot lose this salvation.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	No and yes.|`|DDYIrSKOaa	Nope|`|AA11989753	"IT IS FINISHED."

At the time of Salvation we are SEALED BY GOD.  Can you  'unseal yourself'? God said that HE would seal us until the day of redemption!  We cannot undo what God has already done! Jesus also told Nicodemus that one must be born of water <br>  (natural birth /flesh) and the spirit(being quickened by God/born again/ made alive in Christ)  to enter into heaven. Jesus said that which is born of flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Just as we need to be born physically from the womb to live here, we have to be REBORN of the Spirit of God to live eternally in heaven. Without the "quickening" of the spirit of God which makes your spirit pass from death to life, you ARE DEAD.  There is nothing about your spirit to take it UP!

Genetic studies indicate most of the Ancient Egyptian mummies are Arab Semitic White, followed by a small amount of Nubians-people of Kemit-Sudanese and some Nilotics, Black/Arab mix-most experts consider this mix to be the Hamites,the Berbers and Moors are essentially Arabs with 8-15% Black heritage, and a smaller amount of Indo European Aryan Whites(Iranians/Persians, Greeks, Romans, Turks) and Asiatics(both Oriental and non Oriental).The population break down of Ancient Egypt has remained the same as present day Egypt-65% Arab Semitic White, 30% Black(mostly Nubian, some Nilotic), Black/Arab mix, and 5% all other ethnicities.The Ancient Egyptians in their "Book of the Gates" (see link) clearly delineated themselves from the Black Nubians See the following links for more information: <br>    <br>  <a href="http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpress.com/2008/07/22/the-faces-of-ancient-egypt/" rel="nofollow">http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpre...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/enbp/pbs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/enbp/pbs.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_africa/v032/32.1keita.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Gates" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Gat...</a><br>  <br>  In the Ancient Egyptian "Book of the Gates"-the dark brown Ancient Egyptians very clearly DELINEATE themselves from the black, Black Nubians.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wally_mo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/wally_mo/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catchpenny.org/race.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catchpenny.org/race.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/RaceOfAncientEgypt.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/R...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/12/13/where-the-ancient-egyptians-black-or-white/" rel="nofollow">http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE: Afro centrists attempt to portray the Nubians as the Ancient Egyptians against scientific evidence, including DNA testing(haploid) and anthropological measurements of the mummies.This link from above shows the genetic proof -the Hamitic theory is outdated and proven wrong by DNA testing(haploid):<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_africa/v032/32.1keita.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_...</a><br>  <br>  Arabs are classified as Caucasian, although most are swarthy and have the same coloration as many of the Southern Indo European Aryan Whites-Iranians/Persians, Greeks, Southern Italians, Southern Germans, and the Tamilils of India(very dark brown).Arabs also get much darker in Egypt's climate.Many of the Egyptian murals show many different peoples with different facial features and skin coloration because of the mix as described above.

The indigenous peoples of Maghreb(generally applied to all of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, but in older Arabic usage pertained only to the area of the three countries between the high ranges of the Atlas Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea) are classified as Aboriginal Caucasoid(White/appearing White).Currently, a full 1/3 of Africa(North) is Arab Semitic White as well as smaller amounts of Jews(Semitic White,closely related to the Arabs) and Indo European Aryan Whites and even smaller amounts of other ethnicities.|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	What makes you think that they weren't black? why doesn't any question the Ancient Nigerians or the Ancient Ghanaians or Ethiopians, no one questions whether or not they were black.

In all cases the New World Translation uses “Sheol” for the Hebrew word she’ohl′. The Greek Septuagint generally renders she’ohl′ as hai′des.<br>  The derivation of the Hebrew word she’ohl′ is uncertain. According to one derivation, it means the “place of inquiry”; according to another, the “hollow place” or “resting-place”; according to still another, “the place that asks for and demands all without distinction of persons.” It is in the earth and is always associated with the dead, and plainly means the common grave of mankind, gravedom, or the earthly (not sea) region of the dead. In contrast, the Hebrew word qe′ver means an individual grave or burial place.—Ge 23:4, 6, 9, 20.<br>  The Ten Occurrences of Hades<br>  “Hades,” perhaps meaning “the unseen place,” occurs ten times in the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures, namely, in Mt 11:23; 16:18; Lu 10:15; 16:23; Ac 2:27, 31; Re 1:18; 6:8; 20:13, 14.<br>  In Ac 2:27, Peter’s quotation of Ps 16:10 shows Hades is the equivalent of Sheol and is applied to the common grave of mankind (in contrast with the Greek word ta′phos, an individual grave). The Latin word corresponding to Hades is in·fer′nus (sometimes in′fe·rus). It means “that which lies beneath; the lower region,” and well applies to the grave. It is thus a fitting approximation of the Greek and Hebrew terms.<br>  In the inspired Scriptures these words are associated with death and the dead, not with life and the living. (Re 20:13) In themselves the words “Sheol” and “Hades” contain no thought or hint of pleasure or pain.|`|sGojEWOxaa	You should not be confused, you should understand that there are two sides to God, He is a God of judgement and a God mercy.<br>  <br>  Malachi 3:5-6 (King James Version)<br>  <br>   5And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts. <br>  <br>   6For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.<br>  <br>  Many people today only want to hear and believe information about the merciful side of God, they ONLY want to learn about His love.<br>  He is very loving and merciful and kind, but He is also just.  His Word is what will judge us, and we do not live according to His Word, we will be cast into the lake of fire.<br>  It's only one way or the other, either you live for God, and serve Him with all of your heart, soul, mind and stregnth and your name is written in the lambs book of life, or not.<br>  <br>  Revelation 20:15<br>  And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.<br>  <br>  Revelation 21:8<br>  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.<br>  <br>  John 12:48<br>  He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.|`|td6WXhv4aa	The Lord does not want anyone to suffer the souls on this earth have fallen in a lower state of consciousness dominated by their carnal and linear minds, they no longer know God’s law.

It is not in the Bible so anyone who tells these things is wrong and just trying to scare people. There are references to torment but mostly not quite in the way we think of it.<br>  <br>  The Revelation passages are about a vision in which death was also depicted as riding on a horse. So I think we can safely say it is symbolic, as I believe is the lake of fire.<br>  <br>  What was the case was that the RC Church used these sort of verses to instill fear into its congregations. Do JW's and Mormons also believe these to be literal? I think so.<br>  <br>  What Scripture is trying to impress upon people is just how seriously the LORD God takes wilful disobedience towards Him. What we are told is that those who probably should have known better will be judged unworthy of the kingdom. They will watch others go in and be shut out themselves. After that eternal death.<br>  So when we look at these passages we must take them as a warning not, I believe, a literal lake.<br>  <br>  Revelation 19<br>  20 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. <br>   <br>  Revelation 20:10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.  <br>  14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.  <br>  15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

dmTVbpcWaa	Pardon the paste..however.<br>    Paul wrote the Corinthian Christians about partaking unworthily because?a problem had arisen in the congregation in regard to the Lord’s Evening Meal. Some did not respect its sacredness. They brought their supper with them and ate it before or during the meeting. Often they ate and drank to excess. This made them drowsy and dulled their senses. By not being mentally and spiritually alert, they could “not discern the body” and thus became “guilty respecting the body and the blood of the Lord.” Meanwhile, those who had no supper were hungry and also became distracted. Virtually none of them were in a condition to partake of the emblems with appreciation and full realization of the seriousness of the occasion—that the celebration was in memory of the Lord’s death. This resulted in judgment against them, for they were showing disrespect, even contempt, for it.—1?Corinthians 11:27-34.<br>                                Discernment Needed<br>  Some have partaken of the Memorial emblems although, later, they realized that they should not have done so. Those who rightfully partake of the Memorial emblems have been chosen by God and have the testimony of God’s spirit to that effect. (Romans 8:15-17; 2?Corinthians 1:21, 22) It is not their personal decision or determination that makes them worthy. God has limited the number of those who will rule with Christ in the heavens to 144,000, a relatively small number compared with all those benefiting from Christ’s ransom. (Revelation 14:1,?3) The selection began in Jesus’ day, so it follows that today there are only few partakers. And as death overtakes some of them, that number should decrease.<br>  Why might one wrongly partake of the emblems? It may be due to previous religious views—that all the faithful go to heaven. Or it may be because of ambition or selfishness—a feeling that one is more deserving than others—and a desire for prominence. Perhaps it is the result of strong emotions arising from severe problems or a tragedy that makes one lose interest in life on earth. It may also be because of a close friendship with someone who has the heavenly calling. All of us need to remember that the decision is solely God’s, not ours. (Romans 9:16) So if a person, “after scrutiny,” finds that he really should not have been partaking of the emblems, he should now refrain.—1?Corinthians 11:28.|`|c898150558ddb7ef0e50782e0a5d05b4aa	Jesus revealed that the opportunity to go to heaven did not open up until John the Baptist introduced Christ to the world. <br>  <br>  Matthew 11:11 reads: "Truly I say to you people, among those born of women there has not been raised up a greater than John the Baptist; but a person that is a lesser one in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he is. But from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of the heavens is the goal toward which men press, and those pressing forward are seizing it. For all the Prophets and the Law, prophesied until John."<br>  <br>  If John was the greatest prophet of God, as Jesus said, and yet he is lesser than the least one in the kingdom, then that means John is not in the ruling kingdom. And since, according to Christ, no one before John entered the kingdom, then it is evident that neither has Abraham entered the kingdom, as many wrongly suppose.<br>  <br>  At Ephesians 1:10 Paul made reference to God gathering the things on the earth as well as the things in heaven and making both groups subject to Christ. <br>  <br>  That speaks to those who are not part of the body of Christ but who have the hope of everlasting life on earth.|`|AA10276327	I'm not a JW, but I'd suspect that their answer may lie in the implications of I Cor. 11:29 ("For if he does not recognize the meaning of the Lord's body when he eats the bread and drinks from the cup, he brings judgment on himself as he eats and drinks..") <br>  <br>  The reasoning being, that only a believer , that is one who is "going to heaven" will recognize the meaning of the sacrament." Thus, all others should refrain from it.|`|CcHUacLPaa	The majority of JWs are not "anointed" but are members of another flock. That flock is the ones that will inhabit this earth once the Devil and his demons and all evil is removed from this Planet. The whole world has been saved by Jesus. It is not a matter of acceptance, it is a matter of fact."For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world through him. Eternal life on a paridise earth with perfect conditions is a good thing. How would you like to be in heaven and help God with his 144,000? Well if you wish too go ahead and take the communion. Let God deside if your application is accepted. I am sure Rev kip will get his chance. Everyone who claims they know God but is hating his brother is a liar. God is love. Their are many paths towards God and many rooms to enter. If you spend your time trying to knock the Muslims or the Jew or Buddists or even the lowly JWs who are passing God's message of love around then you may be bloodguilty. Why? Because God's light came into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light, for their actions were evil. All who do evil hate the light and refuse to go near it for fear their sins will be exposed. But those who do what is right come to the light so others can see that they are doing what God wants."|`|DtlQawvgaa	No place in the Bible is communion restricted to only the 144,000, as the Witnesses teach. This is a fabrication of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. The fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses do not take communion is a demonstration that they are not in the body of Christ and do not have a covenant relationship with Christ. The Lord's Supper is meant for the body of believers in the true and living God who have been redeemed by the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord's Supper is not for those who are outside the camp of Christ. Since the great majority of the Jehovah's Witnesses do not take communion, this is a testimony against them.<br>  <br>  There is no mention of limiting communion to anyone except that they examine themselves and rightly discern that the elements represent Christ's sacrifice, not a mere meal to satisfy hunger.<br>  <br>  "But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 29For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he does not judge the body rightly," (1 Cor. 11:28-29, NASB). <br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|KGJGqFalaa	Who partook when Jesus instituted the Lord's Evening Meal shortly before he died?  Eleven faithful followers with whom Jesus made a covenant.  (Luke 22:29)  They were all persons who were being invited to share with Christ in his heavenly Kingdom. (John 14:2,3).   All who partake of the bread and wine today should also be persons whom Christ brings into that "covenant for a kingdom."<br>  <br>  How many are there that partake?

At least in recent years the Archbishop of Canterbury has been understanding enough to allow Catholics to celebrate an annual mass in most of the important pre-reformation shrines.

Including those not of the religion a building is designated.|`|FpMS47sXaa	Maybe so, but then Christians would have to give back the Pagan Temples they turned into churches. <br>  <br>  The "Rock" In Jerusalem sits on a sight that was once a Pagan Temple.<br>  <br>  Something tells me neither Christians NOR Muslims will be giving that back.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  My answer is just as valid. You expect a CEO to give back a church to Christians, but you are not willing to do that same "Christian thing" for others.<br>  Why a double standard?!?
q7z7Ni3Daa	It's generally easier for a British person to adopt a Standard American accent than for an American to adopt a British accent, even RP English, which is like our Standard. I'm being very specific because I am only talking about that accent, not the more commonly spoken accents of the US.<br>  <br>  I think this is true because British exposure to American accents is a lot more common from a young age than American exposure to British accents. Just turn on a TV in either country, flip through the channels, and you'll see my point. It's easier to imitate what you hear more, especially if you heard it as a child. <br>  <br>  Personally, I once shared a cab ride with a guy from Liverpool and entertained him with my attempts to copy his accent. He pronounced me a failure and said I sounded more like a South African. =) <br>  <br>  Of course, I'm giving a general answer and the question depends on the individual.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|LDVBKMiSaa	Well punjabi girl i have to say that i really dont know!<br>  <br>  Nahh americans think they can but they REALLY cant<br>  Iv only ever been to vancouver soz<br>  <br>  EDIT: it wasnt until wales gained partial independence from london that london was the capital of britian so i guess your friend may be stuck in the 18th century.

But at the same token, I also think that its just as easy for an american to speak with a british accent. Once you live in a region of the world where they use an accent of ur first language, u may adapt it a little and just begin to speak some words with that accent. after all you're always around people with accents you eventually pick it up. But for canadians, they already speak with a more closer accent to british than american have so its expecially for canidans to speak with a british one and viceversa for britts.|`|qIgzwUp9aa	American accents are easy to put on by British, as are Canadian accents, (you just literally go up a tone at the end of every sentence!)<br>  Americans are actually crap at English, Scottish and Irish accents, they think they can do it, but they do a proper stereotypical accent that irritates the heck out of us!! :(<br>  grrrr, a message to the americans out there, no-one says pip-pip and tally-ho, and no-one ever has<br>  we dont all speak like the queen and say "one enjoys rugby" or anything stupid like that!<br>  honestly, its really annoying when people say that.<br>  also, Britain has many different accents, Highland/lowland Scottish, Northern and Southern Irish, Yorkshire, Cockney, jordy, etc not just one.<br>  Thats like saying everyone speaks like a New Yorker, when clearly in Texas the accent is TOTALLY different.<br>  and, while im educating you :P, there is no capital of "Britain", it is different to England as it includes Scotland, N.

Around 397AD at the council of Carthage, the church decided "officially" what was to go into the bible. <br>  3) Nothing in the bible can TRULY contradict what the Catholic church believes fro 2 reasons.  1) We essentially gave the world the bible, we know best what went into it and how to interpret it  2) Other religions don't believe in "infallible interpretation, so they don't believe any one person has authority to say 1 person is right and 1 person is wrong, at best all they can have is a TIE,  the Cahtolic church interprets things 1 way, the other person, differently - TIE.<br>  4) The Catholic church has scripture to back up everything we believe,.. even Purgatory, Intercession of the Saints (AKA Praying to Mary) Confession, etc. <br>  5) Catholics represent a distinct culture, one which goes back thousands of years, which is often times MUCH different then the Western World.<br>  6) The Vatican is its own nation, the smallest in the world. Has its own seat on the UN Council. <br>  7) Most other Churches rely solely on the bible.. this is fine, NOW, 1600 years later, when bibles are free and most of the Western world can READ.  But they have abandoned the beliefs from before the bible existed, what the early christians in the 1st century believed. - This is a huge historical issue and a major inconsistency.<br>  8) The Catholic church is the largest Private provider of Health Care and Education in the world. - Most of the people it helps can't even fully pay for their services.  40,000 hospitals 100,000 social services facilities. <br>  Catholic Charities.org which is but 1 of the charities, helped an estimated 80million people in over 100 countries worldwide last year. 7,498 Catholic Schools, or roughly 15% of all students in the US. -- Many people TALK about doing God's work..

The Catholic Church is a communion of 23 sui juris particular churches. Among these are the Western Rite (Latin Rite) and Eastern Catholic Churches comprising 2,782 dioceses. The Church's highest earthly authority in matters of faith, morality and Church governance is the pope, currently Benedict XVI who holds supreme authority over the Church in concert with the College of Bishops, of which he is the head. The community is made up of an ordained ministry and the laity; members of either group may belong to organized religious communities.<br>  <br>  The Church defines its mission as spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ, administering the sacraments and exercising charity. It operates social programs and institutions throughout the world, including schools, universities, hospitals, missions and shelters, as well as organizations such as Catholic Relief Services, Caritas Internationalis and Catholic Charities that help the poor, families, the elderly and the sick.<br>  <br>  Through apostolic succession, the Church believes itself to be the continuation of the Christian community founded by Jesus in his consecration of Saint Peter, a view shared by many historians. It has defined its doctrines through various ecumenical councils, following the example set by the first Apostles in the Council of Jerusalem. On the basis of promises made by Jesus to his apostles, described in the Gospels, the Church believes that it is guided by the Holy Spirit and so protected from falling into doctrinal error.<br>  <br>  Catholic beliefs are based on the Bible and on traditions handed down from the time of the Apostles, which are interpreted by a teaching authority. Those beliefs are summarized in the Nicene Creed and formally detailed in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Formal Catholic worship, termed the liturgy, is regulated by Church authority. The Eucharist, one of seven Church sacraments and the key part of every Catholic Mass or Eastern Catholic Divine Liturgy, is the center of Catholic worship.<br>  <br>  With a history spanning almost two thousand years, the Church is one of the world's oldest institutions, and has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilization since at least the 4th century. In the 11th century, a major split (the Great Schism) occurred between Eastern and Western Christianity, largely as a result of disagreements over papal primacy. The Eastern Orthodox churches became a separate entity from the Catholic Church in the resulting schism. Eastern Churches who remained in or later re-established communion with the Bishop of Rome, the Pope, form the Eastern Catholic churches. In the 16th century, partly in response to the Protestant schism, the Church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal, known as the Counter-Reformation.<br>  <br>  Although the Church maintains that it is the "one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church" founded by Jesus Christ, where one can find the fullness of the means of salvation, it acknowledges that the Holy Spirit can make use of other Christian communities to bring people to salvation. It believes that it is called by the Holy Spirit to work for unity among all Christians, a movement known as ecumenism. Modern challenges facing the Church include the rise of secularism and opposition to its stances on abortion, euthanasia and contraception.|`|vMf7pL9Aaa	An excellent site that you should look at is <a href="http://olrl.org/" rel="nofollow">http://olrl.org/</a><br>  <br>  an a book that ever Catholic should read is  <br>  <br>  Tradition and the Church<br>  By: Msgr.

I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things.

I was once on the same boat you are on now, and once I started to learn about my faith, it felt like many doors were opened for me. Sometimes I even consider majoring in religion and philosophy....<br>  Anyways, first off, please don't listen to anyone who disregards Catholicism. Those type of questions have honestly made me stronger in my faith! <br>  It is difficult to state the Catholic Doctrine in one answer, so I recommend that you read the Catechism of the Catholic Faith, all our beliefs are listed in there. The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Catholicism is also a good book. The Bible would be handy too, of course!<br>  If possible, you should attend religion education classes, I have learned a lot from those, now that I have actually started to pay attention haha.<br>  <br>  The Nicene Creed is basically a summary of what us Catholics believe:<br>  <br>  We believe in God, the Father, the Almighty,<br>  maker of heaven and earth,<br>  and all that is seen and unseen.<br>  <br>  We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,<br>  the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father,<br>  God from God, Light from Light,<br>  true God from true God,<br>  begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father.<br>  Through him all things were made.<br>  For us men and for our salvation<br>  he came down from heaven:<br>  by the power of the Holy Spirit<br>  he was born of the Virgin Mary,<br>  and became man.<br>  For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;<br>  he suffered, died, and was buried.<br>  On the third day he rose again<br>  in fulfillment of the Scriptures;<br>  he ascended into heaven<br>  and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br>  He will come again in glory<br>  to judge the living and the dead,<br>  and His kingdom will have no end.<br>  <br>  We believe in the Holy Spirit,<br>  the Lord, the giver of life,<br>  who proceeds from the Father and the Son.<br>  With the Father and the Son<br>  he is worshiped and glorified.<br>  He has spoken through the Prophets.<br>  <br>  We believe in one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.<br>  We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.<br>  We look for the resurrection of the dead,<br>  and the life of the world to come.<br>  <br>  Amen!<br>  <br>  <br>  This is also a good site:<br>  <a href="http://www.catholic.org/prayers/beliefs.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.org/prayers/beliefs....</a><br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to ask questions, that is how we learn!<br>  And if have any more questions, please feel free to e-mail me.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qyoXSdPCaa	Preface from Understanding Roman Catholicism<br>  by Rick Jones<br>  <br>  As a child growing up in a Roman Catholic home, I often wondered about the practices of the Catholic church. One example is "eating meat on Fridays." During my childhood years, this was a sin that would send you to hell. Then one day the church declared that it was now okay. Questions popped into my young mind like: "Did God change His mind?" "If so, why?" I asked myself, "Why was it sinful to eat meat on Fridays, but not on any other day?" I wondered, "How did God in heaven get word down to man that this practice no longer bothered Him?" I thought about the millions of people who had died and gone to hell for committing this sin, and asked myself: "Now that it's no longer a sin, will God release them from hell and bring them to heaven and apologize?"<br>  <br>  Let me ask you... do you have questions about what your church teaches? If so, this book can help. Keep in mind, someday you will stand before God, and you won't be able to say, "See my priest... he takes care of my spiritual matters." You will give an account of your own life.<br>  <br>  1. The catechism is the official source for all Roman Catholic doctrine. No one can deny that it contains the actual teachings of the Roman Catholic church. <br>  <br>  2. Published in 1994, this is the first new catechism in over 400 years. Therefore you can be assured that you are reading the current teachings of the Roman Catholic church, not what it may have taught three hundred years ago. <br>  <br>  In this book, we will examine 37 of the most critical Roman Catholic doctrines, then let the facts speak for themselves. <br>  <br>  You will not find personal opinions or philosophies presented here. This is strictly a declaration of true Roman Catholic doctrine and how those doctrines compare with the Bible. You must draw your own conclusions and make your own decisions. <br>  <br>  Neither is this a book of judgment or condemnation. Its sole purpose is to help you better understand Catholic doctrine so you will be prepared when you stand before God for judgment, as we all must do after death: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chick.com/reading/books/160/160cont.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.chick.com/reading/books/160/1...</a>|`|JoDpDj8Uaa	The easiest way to go about finding out about your religion is to go to your nearest Catholic Church and talk to a priest.  He would have a much clearer view of what makes a person Catholic than any person on this website (...who isn't a priest, nun, or other religious vocation). Reading the Bible is always a good option. :)|`|mG3jxCBBaa	Welcome back to Catholicism. Please listen to the users "Catholic Defender" and Galactic Emperor, they Seem to know what they talk about, however do not listen to People like heaven bound, he/she/it is very ignorant and stubborn, calling Catholicism a Cult.|`|HjPxEupWaa	Your family is abit like mine, but welcome!<br>  <br>  Many don't believe the Catholic Church is Christ's true Church, but it is.<br>  <br>  Jesus Christs promised that He would protect His church,that the gates of hell would not prevail against it, and it would last every day in every century until the end of time ,and with no one single days gap MT 16:18, 28:20, Eph 3:21, 5:23 .<br>  <br>  Catholicism believes in the sanctifying role of the Church through the 7 Sacraments as prescribed by Christ. Except perhaps for the Orthodox Church, there's no other christian church that prescribe grace as required by Christ, "whose sins you forgive shall be forgiven, eat my flesh and drink My Blood for eternal life", "What you bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven."<br>  You see the Church was given divine power through Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  But the best thing would be to visit Catholic.com. That's the site for Catholic Answers. Many of the things people criticize about Catholicism get addressed there...graven images -- our statues are not of false gods, but God and Jesus, and saints. We do not worship saints or Mary, we only worship God. But we do talk to them. They're not Dead, unless you don't really believe in everlasting life. So much more...all clarifed by people who actually know the truth.<br>  <br>  Jesus’ Church is called catholic ("universal" in Greek) because it is his gift to all people. He told his apostles to go throughout the world and make disciples of "all nations" (Matt. 28:19–20). For 2,000 years the Catholic Church has carried out this mission, preaching the good news that Christ died for all men and that he wants all of us to be members of his universal family (Gal. 3:28).

I've been a Roman Catholic my entire life and I intend being one forever.  I myself, am not a absolute every sunday going Catholic but I do believe and I do practice 95% of the Catholic ways.  Just to being, as of Wednesday, we're in the time of Lent.  Lent is 40 days before Easter.  As Catholics, usually the Church tells us to give up something or do something consciously in respect for the Lord that died for us around this time.  I'm actually working on being an even more personable and accepting person with all that I come into contact with.  In other words, I want to not judge people the second I meet them or because of where they come from.  I also want to try to pray more and go to Church a little more than just easter and christmas and some times in between. So that's my lenten promise because I do not believe that just giving up my favorite snack like chocolate makes me closer to God, just my opinion.  I was actually upset at the whole Catholic Religion on Ash Wednesday because the priest at my prayer service was not the nicest person and told us that if we really dont care about Ash Wednesday and giving up something that we don't love God and Jesus. I don't agree with him and it made me very upset at my religion, but Im over that now and its not a big deal. I know I love God and I don't need some person that I don't even know tell me that.<br>  <br>  I recommend you read the Bible, plain and simple, nothing will tell u more about ur faith than God's words Himself/Themselves.  But don't simply just read the stories but the actual things that Jesus said and ways of Catholicism first, once you understand ur religion a little bit better, then go into the stories in them like Esau and Jacob.<br>  <br>  I've been going to Catholic School since I was in Nursery School. I still decided to continue it in High School today.  It doesn't mean I'm a God Fearing Freak, its not as some people think it is, Its just school but in many aspects we include our religion and God in it.  Which is not such a bad thing now is it. ;)<br>  <br>  Try going to Church and talk with the Priest afterwards, He'd be glad to speak with you i'm sure.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.  Just pray and you will find some of your answers.  And it doesn't have to be the "Our Father," you can actually talk to God.  Ask God to guide you on your road to finding Him in your Religion.  You will find out much more than you ever think.  Wikipedia is also a good source for written stuff....Also Just pray for those less fortunate than you once in a while and you can also ask God to help you in whatever you do.  It never hurts to know that someone up there is looking out for your best interests.  Trust me, I would NOT be where I am today with our prayer and God's Help.  I have gone to places and done things that I never dreamed I could go do and things I could do.  Its unexplainable but it just it.  Also, don't try to understand everything exactly to the point and by the letter of what you read.  Catholicism is experience with the help of the written Word. You embrace your religion by making it a part of your life and just knowing that God is with you.  God is who He is.  DOn't try to understand ALL about HIm and the religion because we are also the religion. Just know that somethings done all have thorough explanations, they just are.<br>  <br>  Like a few nights ago, when I was hating on my religion, I said to my older sister "you know its just so overrated how the priests wear these immaculate clothing and the rules of the religion are so old and I dont believe all of the stories..." and she simply told me "Its tradition. This is what Catholicism is. That is how the priests dress, its nothing to be upset about, its tradition." And that touched me because I saw that I should stop hating on my religion and thinking that its stuck in a time because it was created thousands of years ago and they just keep many things a part of it because its in respect to how it started and it just is that way, nothing more, nothing else about it.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!

OZAxA6J5aa	Hmm, you sound human. Really, no one can be perfect. And it doesn't really matter how bad you are, God will forgive you. Just ask Him for forgiveness!! Jesus died on the cross to pay the price for your sins. He took the punishment for all your lies. You've been given a free ticket into heaven.<br>  <br>  God doesn't always answer our prayers like we want Him to. And the more frivolous a request is, the more likely He is to say no. But keep praying. Pray he'll make you into a better person, that prayer He will certainly answer with a yes!! (Of course, God doesn't normally answer prayers right away. You'll still have to work hard at being good, but know that you are condemned to hell when you mess up.)|`|rTplTuEdaa	You have to ask God to forgive you and mean it,  and you can not keep on sinning,  the thought of Hell should help anyone to walk<br>    with Jesus in this life so we will not go to Hell,,get serious  with<br>    God and you will make it just fine,,the road to Heaven is not hard<br>    to walk because we have Jesus leading the way.|`|6jAVElX7aa	The bible states that if you believe in your heart that Christ is Lord and Saviour, and confess with your mouth that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	hell isn't real...so forget about hell...and just live life|`|AA11308688	Don't worry neither place exists.

I know that I am going to the pearly white gates one day because of this. :)<br>  <br>  This is called "The Roman Road." These verses are found in the Bible and will deliver you into Christ's arms.  <br>  <br>   Romans 3:23  "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."<br>  <br>  We all have sin in our hearts. We all were born with sin. You say you can't keep promises - you are a sinner!! Everyone is. Even as a Christian, I make promises and break them. It is human nature.<br>  We were born under the power of sin's control.<br>  <br>  - Admit that you are a sinner.<br>  <br>   Romans 6:23a  "...The wages of sin is death..."<br>  <br>  Sin has an ending.  It results in death.  We all face physical death, which is a result of sin.  But a worse death is spiritual death that alienates us from God, and will last for all eternity.  The Bible teaches that there is a place called the Lake of Fire where lost people will be in torment forever.   It is the place where people who are spiritually dead will remain.<br>  <br>  - Understand that you deserve death for your sin.<br>  <br>   Romans 6:23b  "...But the gift of God is eternal<br>  life through Jesus Christ our Lord."<br>  <br>  Salvation is a free gift from God to you!  You can't<br>  earn this gift, but you must reach out and receive it.<br>  <br>  - Ask God to forgive you and save you.<br>  <br>   Romans 5:8,  "God demonstrates His own love for us, in<br>  that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us!"<br>  <br>  When Jesus died on the cross He paid sin's penalty. He paid the price for all sin, and when He took all the sins of the world on Himself on the cross, He bought us out of slavery to sin and death! The only condition is that we believe in Him and what He has done for us, understanding that  we are now joined with Him, and that He is our life.  He did all this because He loved us and gave Himself for us!<br>  <br>  - Give your life to God... His love poured out in Jesus on the cross is your only hope to have forgiveness and change.  His love bought you out of being a slave to sin.  His love is what saves you --  not religion, or church membership.  God loves you!<br>  <br>   Romans 10:13  "Whoever will call on the name of the Lord  will be saved!"<br>  <br>  - Call out to God in the name of Jesus!<br>  <br>   <br>  Romans 10:9,10  "...If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, you shall be saved; for with the heart man believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting  in salvation."<br>  <br>  - If you know that God is knocking on your heart's door,<br>  ask Him to come into your heart. <br>  <br>  <br>  And that is it; you are a child of God. Just tell Jesus that you need Him to save you; that you want to stop walking your own way and give your life to him. He will forgive you and you will live with him in heaven forever!!! and one of the best parts is, you get to experience a relationship on earth with the CREATOR of the UNIVERSE!! How awesome is that?!?!?!!?<br>  <br>  I will definitely be praying for you. If you have anymore questions, please find a Bible and go to these verses and read the stuff around them and ask God to open your eyes to what he wants you to hear. Then, get involved with a church. I HIGHLY recommend Baptist, they can help you and encourage you with your walk with Christ.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Read these verses then pray real seriously asking for forgiveness and for Jesus to be your Lord and Savior.  <br>  <br>  Salvation:<br>  <br>  As it is written, there is none righteous, not even one….  Romans 3:10<br>  <br>  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans 6:23<br>  <br>  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16.<br>  <br>  Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him and sup with him and he with me. Revelation 3:20<br>  <br>  As many as received him, to them he gave the power to become children of God, even to them that believe on his name. John 1:12<br>  <br>  Repent therefore, and be converted that your sins may be blotted out and that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord. Acts 3:19<br>  <br>  …that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that <br>  God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.  Rom. 10:9<br>  <br>  If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. II Corinthians 5:17<br>  <br>  <br>  Spend time in the word and in prayer and give up foolish things.  Turn off the TV and entertainment stuff unless you want to listen to Christian praise music.  This is serious.  Take time out for the Lord and don't spend time with bad friends.  Make honest friends who have integrity, don't cheat in school, don't use bad language, etc.  You know.  God be with you.<br>  <br>  Marcia|`|Johiu2cwaa	Ask her nicely.

AawRCyVQaa	read your last question a couple times. please.<br>  <br>  First, you should take everything with a grain of salt, and nothing is set in stone until it actually happens. the tarot is a VERY fine instument for prophecy, but you should only follow the advice or instruction if you believe it is right.  As with anything a second opinion is golden, even a third or fourth.  But when you do go in for another, or request another,  Don't give any informations out, and do not answer any questions. It's called fishing, and you are giving info, that a fraud willl use back. Usually, no question should be needed, and if any it should be general. In my opinion the less information you spill, the more you will get out of a reading that is truly genuine, because you aren't suggesting anything in the first place.|`|CSysSbnlaa	Well, it sounds like the second psychic was just faking it and got freaked when you mentioned the first psychic. You can trust some of those who claim to be psychic. You might want to make sure they're accurate. They should be able to claim examples. For one, I'm setting up my own site to prove I'm accurate, it's slow since I'm busy, though. That's one way a psychic can prove they're accurate. You can trust some of them but not all. The fakes just want to feel like they know everything. I'd make sure. Good luck!<br>  ~Midnightrose

Xcri5qeTaa	I am, but it is not for fear of God, but for fear of woman.<br>  <br>  JK I just always was monogamous.|`|houWY7qvaa	What?<br>  God is aware of anyone who is weak with human desires.  Some people can hold back and others cannot.  If you are asking in a spiritual sense then you would know that God intended individuals to have sex, and after the multitude of people filled the earth, it was expected that you take someone to be your husband or wife and no one else, out of respect for the love that the two of you have for each other.  If this isn't possible, the union should not have been.  Having problems withholding from sex for spiritual reasons, or other are normal and understandable to God as long as you are sincere about feeling any guilt in the first place.  Those who are a slave to sex usually have too much time on their hands.  And unclean sex, fornicating, adultery and the like is from the beast.    I'm not judging, I'm just commenting on what is allegedly expected of you spiritually or not spiritual at all.

q6H2ru3waa	Yes Jesus is worthy to be praised, we are the ones who are not worthy, it is because of His unmerited Grace that we are saved in the first place, and Yes we do serve Him in many ways with love in our hearts for others,  and preaching and teaching The Good News of Jesus Christ, helping feed the poor, cloth the naked,  housing the homeless, doing good things and glorifying God, we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us, we could not do these things without the power of God (Holy Spirit) that dwells on the inside of us. The Father, Son (Jesus) and Holy Ghost are One.  In order to for you to comprehend read 2 Timothy 2:15-16; Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 16) But shun profane and vain babblings (worthless talk) : for they will increase unto more ungodliness.  When you doubt The true Word of God,  you will become confused and this can cause you to loose you faith.|`|97d2a2d9ef8fc8e73e2d9c8436cd4609aa	The questions you have posed are easily explained if you accept understand the triune nature of God.<br>  Look at this analogy:  God is like H2O.  H2O can be encountered as a solid (ice), liquid (water) or gas (steam).  Each has different forms, each reacts with its environment differently and is perceived by us in different ways and has different uses.  But in all cases and at all times, it is still H2O.<br>  In all your references, I did not see you reference the Gospel John chapter 1.  This is where you find your answer most clearly explained.  In the first chapter of John, we learn that the Word is God.  We also learn that the Word took on flesh and came to dwell with men.<br>  Jesus Christ is the Word.  So yes, Jesus is God.<br>  Try another analogy:  I am a single person.  But at the same time, I am a father to my kids, husband to my wife and engineer in my profession.  I am manifested in three forms all at the same time.  I take a different role in each form.  Yet all the time I am one person.<br>  So yes, we do serve Him and He is worthy of worship and praise.
r8rykCkGaa	He never contradicts Jesus Christ.  He was a very strong true follower of Jesus.  The reason he talks differently is for two reasons:  he's called for a different spectrum of the spiritual renewal.  He's dealing with things that Jesus didn't exactlly deal with, or on a different level.  The Spirit works where it's needed.  The devil thinks of new ways to attack the believers, so the Holy Spirit has to guide us in different ways.  Paul's personality was not the same as Jesus either.  We are all individuals.<br>  <br>  He never contradicted Jesus.|`|d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	According to your bible, Jesus elevated the status of women to equality with men. The first person the "risen Christ" spoke to was a woman, whom he told to go tell his disciples that he was "risen." This is an illustration representing Jesus' directive to women (as well as men) to go teach "the gospel" of his "resurrection." The apostles, being men, didn't believe her, for which Jesus later chastised them. Paul, on the other hand, was a misogynist and tried to put women back as subordinates, without equal rights. Paul blathered a lot about his own opinions, as an embittered and guilt-ridden old man given to seizures under which he claimed to have odd delusions. In this day and age Paul would be recognized as mentally ill, which he apparently was.<br>  <br>  If a person believes in Jesus, he should realize how very, very strange it is that Jesus foretold all kinds of things about his "second coming" but never, not once, ever, talked about a guy who would come along in a couple of decades - someone he never met - who would have the authority to speak for him. As a matter of fact, Jesus repeatedly warned that others would in fact come and claim to speak for him, but they would be liars, and would "deceive even the very elect." I think on this prediction Jesus was spot on, because Paul did just that. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately Paul also essentially created what would become the New Testament: he wrote the vast majority of it himself, and took possession of, edited and rewrote the books purported to be by those who had actually known Jesus in the flesh. The New Testament is Paul's baby, but from a factual historical standpoint it's clearly based in pagan roots -- *not* Jewish roots. True Christianity would be a branch of Judaism rather than something entirely different, as it became after Paul gave it a pagan makeover. <br>  <br>  Even a fragment of common sense should tell believers that if Paul had been a legitimate representative of Jesus, Jesus would have said so while he was still very much alive. Do you ever wonder why he spent several years dedicated to teaching his followers how to preach his message when suddenly he does an about face after death and digs up some stranger (with delusions) to show up out of the blue and claim to speak for him? Or why he didn't tell Peter "On this rock I build my church, but only until a bald-headed stranger none of us ever even met comes along and takes over"? <br>  <br>  Jesus's message originally had been fundamentally Jewish, but Paul changed all that. He modified Jesus' teachings to fit in with the pagan religions of Greece and Rome, which corrupted the original Christianity into something Jesus would not have condoned or even recognized. <br>  <br>  Paul corrupted Jesus' teachings from "Follow me, do as I do, and strive to be perfect" into "I am God's whipping boy, sent to save your souls, so just believe I died for your sins and you'll get to heaven." A sad and sick corruption of the truth.|`|AQBow7Glaa	It wouldn't do any good to answer this question--anything can be rationalized away.<br>  <br>  Also Paul is the one who made a bunch of rules that said "do this" and "don't do that."  Jesus had more of a soft sell, so his pronouncements can always be written off with the excuse, "he didn't really say not to do that."<br>  <br>  But Paul told people not to do a bunch of things--don't get married, don't have long hair if you're a man, don't allow women to preach or have their heads uncovered in church, don't be gay--that Jesus just never mentioned. So in that sense, Paul made up a bunch of rules that people still follow and that are not confirmed by anything Jesus said.|`|8jhACvtlaa	Yeah, no answers.  I didn't think there would be any.....

DtlQawvgaa	Very fair! Here is the explanation and history of this cults dangerous doctrine!<br>  <br>  Acts 15:19-21,28 is the Scripture the JW cult typically point to as the reason they refuse to accept blood donations. <br>  <br>  Acts 15:20 says, "Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood." <br>  <br>  It is clear from the context that the instructions were against eating / drinking blood, not blood transfusions. Blood transfusions were not even possible in Bible times, so there is no possibility that this Scripture could be referring to blood transfusions. There were many pagan religious practices that involved eating and drinking blood and/or strangling an animal to keep more of its blood in its meat. <br>  <br>  The Scriptures and all people recognize the difference between eating or drinking something as a food for nourishment or pleasure, as compared to taking the same thing for medical treatment (see 1 Tim. 5:23).<br>  <br>  After Russell's death in 1916, Joseph Franklin Rutherford succeeded Russell as president of the Watchtower organization. Under his administration Jehovah’s Witnesses depicted uses of blood as heroic and the Lord’s work.<br>  <br>  In 1925, blood transfusion was mentioned in an issue of Golden Age. It reported on Mr. B. W. Tibble who donated blood on forty-five separate occasions. The article highlighted his refusal of payment for donating, and the honor accordingly bestowed upon him by Order of the king.<br>  <br>  In 1927 the Watchtower organization addressed blood, stating, “God told Noah that every living creature… must not eat the blood…”.<br>  <br>  In 1931 this was expounded by the Watchtower organization teaching “that it was not the eating of the blood that God objected to, but it was bringing the blood of the beast in contact with the blood of man.” At this time the Watchtower organization taught that human blood was sacred and that it was wrong to contaminate human blood with animal blood.<br>  <br>  In 1940 while discussing interesting medical news, the Watchtower organization reported on a woman who accidentally shot herself with a revolver in her heart and survived a major surgical procedure during which an attending physician donated a quart of his own blood for transfusion.<br>  <br>  After Rutherford’s death in 1942, the Watchtower organization (under Nathan Homer Knorr’s administration) wrote in 1944, “the stranger was forbidden to eat or drink blood, whether by transfusion or by the mouth” and that this applied “in a spiritual way to the consecrated persons of good-will today, otherwise known as “Jonadabs” of the Lord’s “other sheep.””<br>  <br>  In 1945, the application of the doctrine on blood was expanded to prohibit blood transfusions of whole blood, whether allogeneic or autologous. While the prohibition didn't specify any punitive measures for accepting a transfusion, by January 1961 it became a disfellowshipping offence to conscientiously accept a blood transfusion. This represented an admitted shift toward increased strictness by the Watchtower organization imposing additional obligation upon the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses. As part of this doctrinal shift, the Watchtower organization warned that accepting a blood transfusion could prevent them from living eternally in God's new world.<br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|EJHhCDcaaa	Forbidding blood transfusions is an example of legalistic Western minds formulating doctrine without an understanding of the native spirit behind ancient Eastern Biblical texts. A blood transfusion is not the same as eating blood. For one, blood transfusions do not involve digesting blood. Secondly, blood transfusions do not result in the death of the donor. Biblical commands on blood, such as given to Noah at Genesis 9:4 was that the blood was to be poured out of a slaughtered animal. Blood law was given to show repect for life during the ritual of killing for food. <br>  <br>  It is pertinent that Jew's are allowed to have blood transfusions. Strict Orthodox Jews soak meat in water, salt it, then drain it in order to draw out all the blood. Yet no Jewish groups forbid blood transfusions. (Likewise, Muslims forbidden to drink blood are allowed transfusions as a life saving procedure.) This is because Jewish kosher probation's are waived in regards to life-saving medical use. Sustaining life overrules the Mosaic Law; a principle referred to as pikuach nefesh. <br>  <br>  Jesus showed that Christians are to follow this principle when he healed and harvested on the Sabbath. He used David as an example to show that that acts of mercy, such as saving a life, are more important than strict adherence to regulation. Consider the following: <br>  Matthew 12:11 "Who will be the man among YOU that has one sheep and, if this falls into a pit on the sabbath, will not get hold of it and lift it out? All considered, of how much more worth is a man than a sheep!" <br>  <br>  Mark 3:4-5 "Next he said to them: "Is it lawful on the sabbath to do a good deed or to do a bad deed, to save or to kill a soul?" But they kept silent. And after looking around upon them with indignation, being thoroughly grieved at the insensibility of their hearts, he said to the man: "Stretch out your hand." And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored." - see also Luke 6:7-10 <br>  <br>  "According to pikuach nefesh a person must do everything in their power to save the life of another, even donate bodily organs. Ovaday Yosef, the former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel, ruled that one may donate an organ to a person in critical need, so long as it does not put the donor's life at risk. It is also permissible to travel on Shabbat to save a person's life. Maimonides declared that a Jew should take the individual, even if a gentile is present, in order to encourage "compassion, loving-kindness and peace in the world" (Mishneh Torah, 2:3). The laws of the Sabbath may be suspended to provide any necessary medical care to a critically ill individual or to an individual in the likelihood of danger to life." Pikuach Nefesh, Ariel Scheib (April 22 2007) (<a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/pikuach_nefesh.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsou...</a> <br>  As respect for life is the most important issue for a Bible student, blood should be transfused in life-and-death situations. This raises the question, "is a blood transfusion ever necessary to sustain life?" <br>  <br>  Blood transfusions are essential at times to sustain life. There is merit in not taking blood in many medical situations, just as there is merit in not taking antibiotics for every illness. Just as antibiotics have been harmfully over prescribed so has the use of blood. However, antibiotics are essential in certain life and death situations, as is blood. Non-blood volume expanders, are as yet not able to substitute for the oxygen carrying capabilities of red blood cells. When red blood cell count becomes low your organs suffocate and die from lack of oxygen; in this situation survival demands a blood transfusion.<br>  <br>  With the stance that the Witnesses take, are they "blood guilty"?  Many Jehovah's Witnesses have died needlessly to protect an ideal or concept that is unbiblical.  This organization has taken their interpretation of the bible to an extreme as to cause the needless deaths of it's members.  Jesus would have done it and would have done it on the Sabbath to save a life.  This is the lesson of Matthew 12, it is more important to save a life then to keep  strict adherence to regulation of Mosaic Law.<br>  <br>  Are they a deadly cult since they push this unbiblical doctrine that kills it's members?  Only God can Judge that and he will!!|`|yz6qXwUiaa	How absurd!  As deadly as those who approve of abortion? or at least don't expel any members guilty of it?  Or those who encourage their children to go off to war and fight and die for their country?<br>  <br>  Get over yourself.  You KNOW the answer to this one.  I doubt if you have EVER known a witness who died for lack of a blood transfusion.  ON the contrary, Medicine is SAFER and more effective for ALL because Jehovah's Witnesses have taken the stand that it is better to obey GOD than to think we are smarter than he is.  He gave us a command and we obey it.  To bad more in the world don't obey God first in their lives.  There would be no war (and the millions who die in wars), There would be no abortions and the 10s of millions who die every year due to THAT.  There would be no AIDS due to its spread by sexual immorality and by blood transfusions.  There would not be a LOT of the things that cause death, drugs, and smoking and sexually transmitted disease.

And, again, why is this? Because the Watchtower Society actually knows this claim to be false.<br>  <br>  Statistics already in the Society's files show refusing blood to be many times more dangerous than taking it. <br>  <br>  This same Watchtower article quotes a doctor favorable to JWs to the effect that significant costs and possible side effects make blood transfusions not worth it. But he admits that foregoing transfusions adds "0.5% to 1.5% mortality to the overall operative risk." That averages out to 1%, or 1 out of 100, of JWs dying for refusing blood in routine operations. That percentage might seem small, but applied to 5 million active JWs, or 13 million Kingdom Hall attenders<br>  <br>  In addition, to prove that the WTS at that time was fully aware that the risks far outweighed the benefits of refusing a blood transfusion, the November 22, 1993 Awake! article titled "Jehovah's Witnesses and the Medical Profession Cooperate" quoted from an academic paper delivered at the University of Paris. And, in that very paper, which Awake! conveniently and deceitfully chose not to quote, there was a statistic that stated that there was approximately "...one death for every 13,000 bottles of blood transfused." The academic paper was called "Blood, Sin, and Death: Jehovah's Witnesses and the American Patients' Rights Movement," by Dr. Charles H. Baron, professor of law at the Boston College Law School, presented at the Colloquium "Sang et Droit."<br>  <br>  So, the Watchtower Society knew from information at that time in its own files that transfusions cause approximately only one death for every thirteen thousand bottles of blood transfused; which, of course, is much, much better odds than the 1 out of 100 JWs dying from refusing blood! Yet, the WTS falsified this by spuriously presenting refusal as safer than acceptance.<br>  <br>  Of course, now they are more than gladly willing to continue to propagate the statistics about any risk of accepting a blood transfusion, including this uncovered one about the one in thirteen thousand bottles used back from 1993, as found in the citation referenced by answerer Chris S; but not a stitch of evidence about the risks of refusal.

mrMkKFqNaa	Sure they do.  I find it interesting that so-called JWs deny this fact when it is in black and white...in their own publications!<br>  <br>  See, for example, 7/15/1961 WT, p. 431: "From a study of God's Word one appreciates that Jehovah does not dispense his dynamic energy through just any organization that chooses to label itself religious. Neither does God deal with individuals independently of HIS OWN WIFELY ORGANIZATION, THE "MOTHER" OF ALL THOSE DEDICATED TO GOD." (caps added for emphasis)<br>  <br>  5/1/1957 WT, p. 274: "If we are to walk in the light of truth we must recognize not only Jehovah God as our Father but HIS ORGANIZATION AS OUR MOTHER." (caps added for emphasis)<br>  <br>  7/15/1983 WT, p. 22: "In order to face up to these violent days, we need the tender guidance of Jehovah’s motherly organization."<br>  <br>  And in 1986, the WT carried this analogy even further, describing God as our Grandfather!  See Worldwide Security Under the Prince of Peace, p. 169: "In such a way the heavenly Father of Jesus Christ will become the heavenly Grandfather of the restored human family. For this reason the human family will enter into a new relationship with the Creator of heaven and earth."<br>  <br>  Has there been "new light" on this matter?  If so, please provide evidence.|`|HziXc5Ovaa	No. And such analysis in your thinking is incorrect.

(WT 7/15/83 pg 22 para 4).<br>  <br>  "In thus showing deep respect for your earthly parents you lay the foundation for a proper relationship with our heavenly Father Jehovah God and his motherly organization. If you are obedient to your human parents, “this is well-pleasing in the Lord” because it is in harmony with his will." (WT 9/15/66 pg 572)<br>  <br>  Maybe you need to do more research into what your organization really teaches, Chris S...|`|FK3lCrUaaa	Yes they do, and any JW who denies this is either misinformed or outright lying.<br>  <br>  "In this way Paul identifies Jehovah's wife as His invisible universal organization, the mother of Christ and of his joint heirs". (Watchtower of May 1, 1957, page 275)<br>  <br>  Briefly, here is the Watchtower's view: They entitled their article (in the issue mentioned above) "Show Respect for Jehovah's Organization". The lead scripture was Proverbs 6, 20:23 (RS).<br>  <br>  "My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching. For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life".<br>  <br>  The article stated, "If we are to walk in the light of truth we must recognize not only Jehovah' God as our Father but his organization as our mother". They then went on to apply the fifth commandment to themselves! "Honor your father and your mother.." as being Jehovah God and the Watchtower organization! Since they consider themselves prophets, they also misapplied the scriptures on Elisha to themselves. They concluded by saying, "Today, also, God requires and exacts from his children obedience, honor and respect. These must be rendered not only to the living God himself, but to his wifely organization as well".<br>  <br>  Now we come to the crux of the matter, under the subheading, "Identifying the Mother Organization". they shockingly said, "The real mother of Christians is not and can not be an earthly organization". They quoted Galations 4:26, "The Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother". Jumping to Isaiah 54:5,6, (and using their ever-present dots to remove the parts that don't fit,) they said:<br>  <br>  "Thy Maker is thy husband; Jehovah of hosts is his name; and the Holy One of Israel is thy Redeemer;....For Jehovah hath called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit." In this way Paul identifies Jehovah's wife as His invisible universal organization, the mother of Christ and of his joint heirs".<br>  <br>  Pardon? They got all that from Isaiah's words to the literal nation of Israel! Somehow they blame Paul for inventing their doctrine! Nevertheless, they state their doctrine, that Jehovah's wife is their "invisible universal organization, the mother of Christ and of his joint heirs". So they do, indeed claim, to be "the mother of Christ". Shocking!<br>  <br>  EDIT:>> Chris, just where is the rubbish in Nina's question? has the above ever been refuted as a belief of the WT religion? If so, I've not seen it printed anywhere.|`|juJv9K4Daa	Don't know anything about Jehovah Witnesses.  I heard they have a disbelief in Christ Jesus.  <br>  <br>  And, just so I can comment.

The Watchtower organization has placed itself between the Christians and the Christ.  <br>  <br>  Jesus said "I am the way, the truth, and the life."  The Watchtower doesn't disagree with this statement, but the Watchtower ADDS to this statement by means of its doctrine that the only way to salvation is by being a member of the JW/Watchtower organization.<br>  <br>  So, the Watchtower leadership (much like the Catholic Pope or the LDS President) inserts itself in between the Christ and the Christian, thus usurping some of the devotion that rightly belongs to Him.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	Technically speaking ~ yes.<br>  <br>  Their faith is misplaced, and misplaced faith is a form of idolatry.

Paul warned of people of his day following after false teachers, that they could "shipwreck" their faith.  In the book of Galatians, he warns there will be those bringing in false gospels, and to be on the lookout for them.  Jesus taught there would be false prophets and even those who claim to have seen Him (again) when He did not really appear.<br>  <br>  We are to know what sound biblical doctrine is so that we can disern the difference when false teachers (of which there are many these days) try and peddle false doctrines, so we can stay away from them.|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	No human being has the ability, even less the authority to do so.

It is important, and biblically founded, that we all must determine (that is, test) whether a person is speaking the truth of God.<br>  * Test prophets: 1 John 4:1, Deuteronomy 13, 18, Matthew 7:15<br>  * Test apostles: Revelation 2:2<br>  * Test ministers: Titus 1<br>  * Test yourself: 2 Corinthians 13:5<br>  * Test people, in general: Matthew 7:16, Ephesians 5:11, 1 Corinthians 10:20, 2 Corinthians 6:14, 1 John 1:7, 2:4<br>  <br>  Yes, God expects us to test and determine if others are true or not.

Paul's letter to the Galatians directly addresses the sufficiency of Christ to those who embrace ritual and law as way to be right before God.  He called them "cursed" who thought Jesus plus Jewish rituals equaled justification.  Jesus is enough and those who taught another gospel were to be "accursed."<br>  <br>  John addressed the importance of the divinity of Jesus in his epistles.  Jesus's role as Messiah or The Christ was key, but also that he was fully God and fully human.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

If they say that they are absolutely sure, then they are wrong because their own statement is an absolute. If they are not 100 percent sure, then there is a chance that they are wrong and they are risking their eternal salvation by trusting in a wrong belief. God tells us that there is an objective, absolute truth that is not subject to man’s interpretations or whims, on which we can base our eternity. That truth is the Word of God (John 17:7).|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Nope. Not even the idea that there are no absolute truths is absolute ^_^.<br>  <br>  They could exist for all we know.

If there are no absolute truths, then truth itself is subjective, and that means chaos.<br>  <br>  Which is to say that nothing is constant. We NEED consistency in areas such as science and mathematics.<br>  <br>  But, can we FIND an absolute truth? I'd have to say that because human beings are limited, we can get 99.99999% of an absolute truth, but I don't think we can ever grasp all of it.|`|vOuSZnKxaa	Yes, there is absolute truth.<br>  <br>  You can believe something that is not truth, if you have faith that it IS truth; the mere fact that you ACCEPT something as truth, however, doesn't mean it is truth.<br>  <br>  You can BELIEVE anything; you can KNOW only Truth.  <br>  <br>  Knowledge is superior to Belief any day.|`|Kbry7CnOaa	There is always absolute truth, but it is always tainted by the how the human perceives it both physically and mentally....|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Jesus is the absolute truth.<br>  <br>   John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.|`|JjoBtLjbaa	Okay lets say you have a bag of marbles<br>  <br>  There are 7 purple marbles and 3 polka-dot (green and blue) marbles<br>  <br>  Which one if you had to pick would you think would come out?|`|KmnbjZIdaa	Yes, there is absolute truth; whatever is in the mind of God is truth.|`|2h8tqOeFaa	That's where logic's comes in and tells us there is absolute truth..|`|AA11502346	Yes, and that absolute truth is Jesus Christ.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	JESUS is the Truth!  :) <br>  <br>  The Bible is the absolute Word of God.

I think religious people can still be very intelligent and rational in other areas so just because they are theists doesn't mean they aren't capable of intelligence and rational thought in other areas of life. You have to form an opinion on the individual not stereotypes of a group. I don't think religion is something people arrive at rationally though. I think its about psychology, cultural and childhood conditioning, and emotions. So I don't think its a decision based on logic. In all my personal seeking, conversations with theists, and observation this is consistently born out. There is no good conclusive evidence for theistic beliefs, we don't usually go ahead an hold positive beliefs where there is such an absence of reason or evidence for the belief.|`|GahpE5U2aa	I don't really care what someone chooses to believe in.<br>  <br>  The keyword here is BELIEVE in.

It put it in the place it ought to be and got it out of the mesmerized equilibrium where you were supposed to accept it without knowing what it was all about and how it came about in the first place.  Knowing how the books were put together and by who and when really helped avoid the more traditional acceptances that didnt even know what the word bible really was in the first place.

First, since the person does not perceive a need for religion, convince them they do by telling them they are born evil, and deserve eternal torment, which they will absolutely get.<br>  <br>  After you've convinced them, that's when you sell them on the solution, your religion, which will not only save them from the torture they deserve in the afterlife for just having been born, but will reward them greatly in the afterlife if they submit to the religion.|`|X548yCR6aa	Untainted.|`|Ma10Exocaa	Lucky|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	There is no validity of which to be aware, so I'd call them by their name.|`|8Zey1ntAaa	A heathen maybe?<br>    Heathen - an irreligious, uncultured, or uncivilized person.<br>  <br>  Mind control cults do not teach the truth, not matter how much you want it to be.

sfTPrMFpaa	à mon avis, la victoire d'Obama est un pas en avant. Bush et son administration ont créé beaucoup de problèmes lors de cette présidence. Ils ont à leur tableau le ralentissement économique, deux guerres, et 8 ans avec peu d'amélioration à la société.<br>  <br>  Je sais qu'Obama ne peut pas régler les problèmes économiques avec un coup de baguette magique mais au moins il prend des mesures positives. Aussi, il a l'intention de finir la guerre en Irak, et il se concentrera sur faire la paix en Afganistan.<br>  <br>  Il est évident qu'il y a beaucoup de problèmes devant Obama et en réalité seul l'avenir nous dira s'il peut les surmonter. <br>  <br>  (only the future will tell us if he can overcome them)

Sounds scary.<br>  <br>  I like the idea of warm evangelism. Nobody is an island. Sharing what you have with people of different beliefs is part of being human. Thinking through new ideas keeps the brain active. Use it or lose it. Presuming the friendship is genuine then in worldly terms it is a win win situation.<br>  <br>  Going too far would be taking away a person's choice to say no. Then it would be a cult and not a church anyway.|`|RyhluHk3aa	Why do you make the witnessing or testifying of Christ sound like a conspiracy?? IF someone asks me about my beliefs, I will tell them. If they do not want to hear it, so be it.<br>  "Proselytize" is a poor choice in terms, as when a Gentile became a proselyte Jew, they LIVED as the Jews LIVED. For Christians, it is not the way that you LIVE that matters, but rather that you BELIEVE in the finished work of Christ on the cross.

He has know-ledge of everything, whether perceptible or imperceptible. He is the Beneficent, the Merciful. He is Allah, besides whom there is no god, the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One, the Giver of peace, the Keeper of faith, the Supreme, the Mighty one, the All powerful and the Majestic. Exalted be He above what they associate with Him. He is Allah, the Creator, the Originator, the Fashioner. His are the most beautiful names. All that is in the heavens and the earth gives glory to Him. He is the Mighty, the Wise". (Surah al?Hashr, 59:22 ? 24).<br>  <br>  "His are the most beautiful names". <br>  <br>  The main feature of the names and the attributes of Allah has been mentioned in this verse. The highest degree of every virtue and every excellence belongs to Allah. For example, power and ability to do things is a good quality. Allah is the most powerful and the most efficient and can do anything.<br>  <br>  The Qur'an says: "Surely Allah can do all things". (Surah al?Ankabut, 29:20).<br>  <br>  Knowledge is a virtue. Allah has the highest degree of knowledge. "Allah is aware of all things ". (Surah al?Tawbah, 9:115).<br>  "He is the Knower of the invisible and the visible. . . ". (Surah al?R'ad, 13:9).<br>  Sagacity is another virtue. The holy Qur'an says: "Allah is Knower, Wise" . (Surahal?Mumtahanah, 60:10). Kindness to others is a good quality. Allah is "the Bene-ficent, the Merciful". "He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy". (Surah al?Hamd, 1:3; Surah Yusuf, 12:64).<br>  Hence you are at liberty to call Him by any of these most beautiful names: "Call Him Allah or Rahman (Beneficent).<br>  <br>  It is the same whichever you call. His are the most beautiful names" . (Surahal?Isra, 17:110). "Allah bas the beautiful names. Invoke Him by them, and keep away from those who prevent them. They shall soon be repaid for what they do ". (Surah al?A'raf, 7:180).<br>  <br>  Allah is Independent<br>  <br>  As Allah has the highest degree of every kind of virtue and perfection, He is naturally free from every fault, defect and deficiency. A number of the Qur'anic verses, extolling Allah, emphasize this aspect of His glory.<br>  The Qur'an declares Allah to be free from every kind of deficiency and need. It regards this freedom as an important principle of the cognizance of Allah, by means of which a number of doctrinal and ideological deviations which have taken birth regarding Allah may be detected.<br>  'Musa said to his people: If you and all those who are on the earth prove to be ungrateful, Allah does not at all need your thanks. He is Laudable" . (SurahIbrahim, 14:8).<br>  Man should remember that because of Allah not being in want of anything, He is not in need of our faith, worship and obedience. If He wants us to be faithful and obedient, that is for our own benefit and not for His. If the whole world becomes unbeliever, that cannot do Him the least harm.<br>  Not being subject to any need, Allah is free from the limitations of time and space. He is above them. A being who occupies space, naturally needs it to exist, and one who is confined to time, can exist only under certain conditions at a particular time. A being not time?bound can always exist and is not dependent upon the special conditions of time.<br>  <br>  Allah is All?knowing<br>  <br>  The Creator of the world knows everything. So far as we are concerned there are two kinds of things in the universe viz. open and hidden, perceptible and imperceptible. <br>  However Allah is aware of both of them. On principle there is nothing unknown to Him. Nothing is hidden from Him. "He is the Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Supreme the Most High". (Surah al?Ra'd, 13:9).<br>  `Nothing in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah ". (Surah Ale Imran, 3: 5). He is aware of the minutest details. He knows all that we do. "Surely Allah knows all that you do" . (Surahal?Nahl, 16:91).<br>   <br>  <br>  Allah is All?powerful<br>  <br>  He controls everything and can do anything. "Surely Allah can do everything". (Surah al?Baqarah, 2:20).<br>  He is so powerful and dominating that whenever He wants a thing to come into existence or wants something to be done, He simply says: "Be!" and immediately it will `be'. The Qur'an says: "His command, when He decrees a thing, is to say to it: `Be' and it is". (Surah Yasin, 36:82).<br>  <br>  Will and Volition of Allah<br>  <br>  Normally all beings endowed with intelligence and power can achieve all or at least a part of what they intend. They at least try to fulfill their desires. When we knowingly plan to achieve our object we say that "we are determined to accomplish such and such task". Hence, determination consists of an intentional and strong will which is effective in the achievement of our desire.<br>  <br>  Out of all the multifarious things existing in this world, the animals or at least the advanced animals are more or less endowed with this quality that when they feel an urge, they try knowingly to fulfill what they want. Out of all the animals known to us man has the most developed will-power. That is why knowledge has a more creative role in his life than in the life of other animals. Anyhow, he apparently does not exercise his will while performing many acts. His circulatory, respiratory and digestive system and his big and small glands which produce the necessary chemicals, all work without the aid of his will.<br>  <br>  There is no doubt that all these systems are connected with the nervous system, and modern physiology has been able to discover for each of them a centre of command in some part of the brain, still every act having some connec-tion with brain cannot be called intentional and deliberate.<br>  It has been reported that some persons consequent on certain exercises and long practice have been able to control the circulation of their blood. Even if such reports be true, they can at best be described as exceptional cases.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, the field of the activity of man's will is after all limited. For example, so far his will has not been able to influence the rotatory system of the heavenly bodies. We also see that every human being has some hereditary traits in the selection of which his conscious will has no part to play. Hence, the influence of human will and volition is after all limited. That is why it often happens that man intends to do a thing, but he does not succeed, or certain factors beyond his control prevent the fulfillment of his many desires. But Allah who is All?knowing and All?powerful, accomplishes all that He wants. "Surely, Your Lord does what He pleases". (Surah Hud, 11:107). "Only Allah can bring punishment on you, if He will, and you cannot frustrate His plan ". (Sura Hud, 11:3 3) .<br>  <br>  His will rules over the whole world, but that is not the case with that of others. "Allah will judge with fairness, and those whom they invoke besides Him can judge nothing". (Surah Mu'min, 40:20). All others whosoever and whatsoever they may be, move within a limited framework decreed for them by Allah, who has destined everything. `Allah has set a measure for everything ". (Surah al?Talaq, 65: 3 etc.)<br>  <br>  This is the universal law which applies to man also. As such his power is limited, but still he can choose his way of life within the framework ordained for him. Allah wants him to use his discretion and determine his future, whether good or bad, himself. Anyhow, even within this framework man, or for that matter any other being, should not consider himself to be in possession of absolute power. If Allah wants, He can make his efforts ineffectual. There are many cases in which He frustrated the efforts of some conceited individuals or groups against all their expecta-tions to remind them and others that even within their own sphere of power they should never be oblivious of the Divine power which controls everything.<br>  <br>  The Qur'an mentions several examples of such a situation. The Surah al?Qalam, 68:17 ? 3 2 illustrate this point. "We have tried them as We tried the owners of the garden when they vowed that they would pluck its fruit next morning. But they made no exception for the will of Allah. As a result a visitation from your Lord visited their garden while they were sleeping. And in the morning it was as if it bad been plucked. They called out to one another in the morning saying: Rush to your garden if you want to pluck the fruit. So they set out, saying to each other in low tones: No poor shall enter the garden today without your permission. They set out early determined to stop the poor. When they saw the garden, they exclaimed: Surely we were wrong. In fact we have been ruined. The best among them said: Did I not tell you: Why do you not glorify Allah? Then they said: Gloried be our Lord. No doubt we have been wrong?doers. Then they began to blame one another. They said: Alas for us! Surely we were outrageous. We hope that our Lord will give us better garden in its place. To our Lord we humbly turn".|`|LjsRfaskaa	Get a lobotomy. :)<br>  <br>  Practicing Shaman... quantum phsyics rocks.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	There is no convincing.

It is equally hard to disprove the existance of God. The existence of God is determined by your definition of God. Is God like a father watching and guiding his children? Is he merely a supreme being from another older world who created this one. If man has reached a point in our relatively short history  were we understand the basic building blocks of all life, then could it be possible that a far older soiciety from another galaxy reached a point in their existance that they could create and manipulate life on our world? Or is God omnipitent over the whole universe. God could be defined as the first cause of the big bang/universe. It is widely accepted by scientist that the universe is expanding. Scientist have also demonstrated that the universe must have been smaller as you go back in time. If you go completely back to the beginning of the universe. It was a singularity point. What no one knows is what "caused" the first event. Was it God or is this first event by definition God. The creater of everything. Many have tried to define who/what God is. These are the basic teachings of all religions. Do not confuse the opinions of other long since dead people about what God is with the possibility that God does exist. The simple truth is life does exist and is complexe and wonderful.

This is simply because God is not a physical object. Any physical object is subject to your five senses. In simple terms, you can see, hear, smell, touch or taste a physical object. This is not possible in the case of God, as He (swt) is a Transcendental Being [existing on a level beyond our sensual perception].<br>  <br>  There are people who argue that the only form of knowledge available to humans is experiential knowledge or experimental knowledge, gained primarily by the use of outer senses. This led to the belief that human beings are constituted in such a way that the knowledge of reality is always unavailable to them; and so it resulted in a renewal of attention to the everyday world of appearances. The knowledge of here and now became the only object of human knowledge and concern. Thus from this point of view, the project of seeking knowledge of reality behind appearances must be abandoned, because it is beyond the scope of human understanding.<br>  <br>  Now think: Can’t there be a way of “being” [existing], that is not susceptible of being perceived by the limited capabilities of humans through their defective senses?<br>  <br>  I hope that the implications of the two expressions I used above [‘limited capabilities’ and ‘defective senses’] are evident to any thinking person. The claim that something does not exist, because you haven’t seen or heard it, etc. is untenable. When we consider the limitations of our sensual perception and of our reasoning powers, it is not necessary that we understand everything. We can speak meaningfully about everything simply on the basis of our perception. So to speak of “proof” with regard to a Transcendental Being becomes irrelevant.<br>  <br>  What we can do is to point out facts which lead to a constant and inescapable awareness of the presence of God. It is clear that logically we cannot rule out the possibility of more things existing than can be perceived by our senses or can be arrived at by our reasoning. As for Man, there are two dimensions to his existence: One of matter and the other of spirit.<br>  <br>  Reduced merely to the level of material existence, Man becomes a machine, or a mere animal at best. But think of a machine that rebels against being a machine; or of an animal that refuses to be an animal. That is what man is! What is it that makes him rebellious, angry, disappointed, frightened or hopeful? What is his dimension that gives him his imagination, his artistic genius, his creative urge? Why does he have nightmares and sweet dreams?<br>  <br>  It is not matter that does it; evidently it is his spirit that makes him so different from animals. So to base our knowledge of the world and our philosophy of life simply on the material side of our existence to the complete exclusion of the spiritual dimension, is undoubtedly faulty. The strength of Islam as a philosophy and as a way of life is that it does not separate man’s material life from spiritual life, and that it seeks a balance between the two dimensions of human existence.<br>  <br>  We should understand that human spirit is a reality incommensurable with material realities, and that it owes its existence only to God. Thus dear brother, if we ponder over the phenomena of the world around us and over the complexities of our own existence, we are bound to conclude that God is the Reality behind all appearances. The Holy Qur’an says in Surah 2, verse 164, the meaning of the following:<br>  <br>      *{Behold! in the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of the night and the day; in the sailing of the ships through the ocean for the profit of mankind; in the rain which God Sends down from the skies, and the life which He gives therewith to an earth that is dead; in the beasts of all kinds that He scatters through the earth; in the change of the winds, and the clouds which they Trail like their slaves between the sky and the earth;- [Here] indeed are signs for a people that are wise.}*<br>  <br>  That is to say the external signs we see in the universe should necessarily lead a wise person to the Ultimate Reality behind it all. And that is how we arrive at the realization that Allah Almighty is the Moving Power behind all life and all existence.<br>  <br>  And Allah knows best.|`|KNQsNbeqaa	There is no proof that God exists.

dz5Og81Qaa	yes|`|pOTigVYPaa	Two registrations are mentioned in the Christian Greek Scriptures as taking place after Judea came under subjection to Rome.  Concerning the first of these we read:  "Now in those days (c. 2 B.C.E.) a decree went forth from Caesar Augustus for all the inhabited earth to be registered; (this first registration took place when Quirinius was governor of Syria;) and all people went traveling to be registered, each one to his own city." (Luke 2: 1-3)  Bible critics have said that the only census taken while Publius Sulpicius Quirinius was governor of Syria was about 6 C.E., which event sparked a rebellion by Judas the Galilean and the Zealots.  This was really the second registration under Quirinius, for inscriptions discovered at and near Antioch revealed that some years earlier Quirinius had served as the emperor's legate in Syria.  Concerning this, the Dictionnaire du Nouveau Testament in Crampon's French Bible (1939 ed., p. 360) says: "The scholarly researches of Zumpt and of Mommsen place beyond doubt that Quirinius was twice governor of Syria."  So historian and Bible writer Luke was correct when he said concerning the registration at the time of Jesus' birth: "This first registration took place when Quirinius was governor of Syria," distinguishing it from the second, which occurred later under the same Quirinius and to which Gamaliel makes reference as reported by Luke at Acts 5:37.|`|bf4d6ed6e4b432f59cf0635119a73f15aa	Let's see now: Quirinius was Roman, and Herod was Jewish.<br>  Different nationalities, and different government functions, though both appointed by the occupying Roman authorities.<br>  This is like saying that Jesus' "trial" was somehow reported incorrectly because he went before two different authorities: Pilot and Herod.<br>  <br>  There are many legitimate incongruities in the synoptic Gospels -- pick on those.

He has found a coin with the name of Quirinus on it in very small writing, or what we call micrographic letters. This places him as proconsul of Syria and Cilicia from 11 B.C. until after the death of Herod. It means that there were apparently two Quiriniuses. It's not uncommon to have lots of people with the same Roman names, so there's no reason to doubt that there two people by the name of Quiriniuses. The census would have taken place under the reign of the earlier Quirinius. Given the cycle of a census every fourteen years, that would work out quite well.<br>  <br>  I found that Sir William Ramsey, the late archaeologist and professor at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities in England, had come up with a similar theory. He concluded from various inscriptions that while there was only one Quirinius, he ruled Syria on two separate occasions, which would cover the time period  of the earlier census. Other scholars have pointed out that Luke's text can be translated, "This census took place 'before' Quirinius was governing Syria," which would also resolve the problem.|`|4OEOxOmPaa	Here are all the contradictions<br>  <br>  <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/index....</a>|`|50Q3KD4raa	i have no religious beliefs but in fairness it was written a fair few years after the said events themselves took place so you would expect a few mistakes wouldnt you?|`|rIvp1BToaa	possible  they got the dating  wrong  but  then yes  I guess so,|`|WalnRzfGaa	Dayna- what would be the point of taking a census and not recording it? how would you take a census without writing something down about it?<br>  <br>  Jesus was not born on Dec. 25th  Jesus was not born in the year 1 A.D.|`|FpMS47sXaa	You are 100% correct.<br>  <br>  And, the Romans were notorious for record keeping - just like the Egyptians - which btw - never recorded a mass exodus of Hebrew slaves.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	It's generally held except among Bible worshipers that the Nativity stories in "Matthew" and "Luke" were fabricated from whole cloth.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean that Jesus didn't exist or that his message isn't important, only that these writers were not the perfect little saints religion has made them out to be.|`|AA12203324	Well, about that sort-of-ish time.

Como resultado de las prácticas satanistas de los Druidas, muerte, enfermedades y destrucción  sobrevino a los celtas. Es por eso que cada 31 de octubre celebraban una fiesta en honor al dios diabólico SAMHAIN, se?or de los muertos, con una noche de terror que comenzaba a la media noche la cual llamaron HALLOWEEN, palabra que surge del “ALL HALLOW`S E′ENDING”(la víspera de todos los santos).<br>  <br>  Los Druidas creían que durante esa noche en particular; los espíritus de los muertos que estaban confinados a habitar en cuerpos de animales como pago por sus malas obras regresaban a visitar a sus parientes vivos, para hacerles un truco (treat), arrojándolos un hechizo maligno que le causara da?o...Para protegerse de ellos se disfrazan, pero si su disfraz de piel de animal no había adquirido el suficiente poder para enga?ar a los espíritus o si por alguna razón se olvidaban disfrazarse había otra forma de salvarse de ellos haciendo un trato (trick) con ellos proveyéndoles comida. En muchos casos satanás y sus demonios mataban a alguno de ellos. Durante la celebración los sacerdotes o sacerdotisas renegaban esa noche públicamente de la fe cristiana y del Dios verdadero, entrando en pacto con satanás,sacrificando un animal ***** y terminando la fiesta en una orgía sexual.<br>  <br>  Es oficialmente fiesta de los satanistas, ocultistas y adoradores de satanás como el comienzo de un nuevo a?o para el ejercicio de la brujería. Los rituales generalmente terminaban en perversiones heterosexuales, prácticas hechiceras y sacrificios de ni?os, las  que beben la sangre de sus victimas y comen su carne para obtener mas poder diabólico en sus hechicerías y brujerías.<br>  <br>  Anthony LaVey, autor de “la biblia satánica”y sumo sacerdote de la iglesia de Satanás, dice:"El día más importante para los seguidores del maligno es el del HALLOWEEN. En esta noche los poderes satánicos ocultos y de brujería están a su nivel de potencia más alto, y que cualquier brujo que haya tenido dificultad con un hechizo o maldición puede tener éxito el 31 de octubre”. El nabo, de cuyo interior surgía una vela encendida, era usado por los Druidas como una linterna cuando iban de casa en casa por la noche creyendo que el espíritu familiar que estaba vagando por la tierra habitaba en el nabo era “jock” y al llegar a América cambio a “jack” quien vive en la linterna, así como los nabos no eran conocidos se les constituyó a de la  calabaza muy conocida en América.<br>  <br>  Dorren Irving, que fue la bruja que gobernaba sobre Europa Occidental e Inglaterra y se?ora del sumo sacerdote de satanás, es ahora Cristiana y llena del Espíritu Santo de Dios dice: "Si los cristianos tuvieran idea de lo  que es en realidad Hallowen, no se atreverían ni tan siquiera a mencionar la palabra delante de sus hijos”.<br>  <br>  Las figuras de HALLOWEEN tienen un significado, que tiene mucha relación con el ocultismo:<br>  <br>  LOS COLORES:<br>  <br>  NARANJA simboliza el color de las velas usadas para la ceremonia de los difuntos.<br>  <br>  EL *****, color del manto con el cual se cubre el féretro en la ceremonia.<br>  <br>  LA CALABAZA: de color naranja, con una vela al centro, simboliza un alma condenada a vagar por la tierra como un fantasma<br>  <br>  BRUJA(o) witch en inglés, que deriva de la palabra wiccan que significa persona que practica encantamiento. Mujer o hombre que tiene pacto con satanás.(Diccionario Océano Uno)<br>  <br>  LAS ESCOBAS: Usadas durante las ceremonias para convertir las fuerzas del orgasmo sexual en una fuerza poderosa.<br>  <br>  LOA GATOS ******: Representan la encarnación de almas humanas.<br>  <br>  Salta a la vista que todo lo que rodea al Halloween como murciélagos, fantasmas, esqueletos, brujas, telas de ara?as, y todo lo que representa a la muerte, el temor, el miedo, el terror, las tinieblas, etc. no tiene nada constructivo para nuestros hijos y ante un análisis superficial, es evidente la connotación negativa para nuestros hijos. El diablo quiere hacernos creer que es una mera fiesta infantil, para de esta manera hacernos festejar indirectamente de una fiesta dedicada a él, para el no hay juegos, le es suficiente que participemos, después él se encarga del resto.Todo lo que rodea a HALLOWEEN esta relacionado con el ocultismo, hasta las mejores películas de terror se pasan por la televisión y en cine.<br>  <br>  ??????NO TE DEJES ENGA?AR!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Celebrar HALLOWEEN es quebrantar los principios de Dios.<br>  <br>  “Así ha dicho Dios, ?Por qué quebrantáis los mandamientos de Jehová?<br>  <br>  No os vendrá bien por ello,(porque por haber dejado a Jehová, él también os abandonara…” ( 2 Crónicas 24:20b)<br>  <br>  “No sea hallado en ti quien haga pasar a su hijo  o a su hija por  fuego, ni quien practique adivinación, ni agorero, ni hechicería, ni encantador, ni adivino, ni mago, ni quien consulte a los muertos. Por que es ABOMINACION para con Dios…” (Deuteronomio 18:10,11)<br>  <br>  Ahora que conoces  lo que es HALLOWEEN  te corresponde adoptar una nueva actitud frente a esta celebración.?NO PERMITAS QUE TUS HIJOS, (SOBRINOS,..etc) PARTICIPEN DE ESTA DIVERSION ENGA?OSA!<br>  <br>  “Y no participes en las obras infructuosas de las tinieblas, sino mas bien, reprenderlas.” (Efesios 5:11).<br>  <br>  Por ellos Dios  nos prohibe participar en ellas.No le creas a satanas. Sólo cree a Cristo el Dios Vivo y Verdadero.<br>  <br>  “…Para esto apareció Jesús para deshacer las obras del diablo” (1Juan 3:8)<br>  <br>  JESUCRISTO es la verdad y solo El podrá guiarte a conocer la verdad. Jesús dijo:<br>  <br>  “Y conoceréis la verdad y la verdad os hará libres…” (Juan 8:32)<br>  <br>  Por ello te invito a que lo conozcas y recibas como tu Se?or y Salvador Personal, si aun no lo conoces.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Repite esta oración:<br>  <br>  “Se?or Jesús, sé que soy pecador y te pido perdón por mis pecados, reconozco que moriste por mis pecados en la cruz del calvario  y al tercer día resucitaste de entre los muertos;<br>  <br>  Te acepto por fe como mi Se?or y Salvador, escribe mi nombre en el libro de la vida.

Then, when in the Ramadan of the same year this incident took place the news spread that the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had recited Surah An-Najm publicly in the assembly of the Quraish and the whole assembly, including the believers as well as the disbelievers, had fallen down in prostration with him. When the emigrants to Abyssinia heard this news they formed the impression that the disbelievers of Makkah had become Muslims. Thereupon, some of them returned to Makkah in the Shawwal of the 5th year of Prophethood, only to learn that the news was wrong and the conflict between Islam and disbelief was raging as furiously as before. Consequently, the second emigration to Abyssinia took place, in which many more people left Makkah.<br>  <br>  Thus, it becomes almost certain that this Surah was revealed in the Ramadan of 5th year of Prophethood.

0aN1xIxfaa	As a T.C., I offer this response in fear and trembling...!<br>  <br>  As I understand it, all humans who go to heaven will require glorified bodies to live there. That's even what Jesus required at his resurrection! Right now there are the souls of those under the altar in heaven, crying out to God, "How long..." and they are told to wait a while longer till the full number of them has been reached. At that point, they will all be clothed with glorified bodies in order to come with Christ down to the earth at His second coming. Then the graves of the saints will be opened and their mortal remains will arise, being transformed into glorious, heavenly bodies, to meet them in the air. "And so we will always be with the Lord" Paul concludes.<br>  <br>  The sub-division idea you introduce is hardly scriptural (or, if it is, could you please give the sources?) There is one faith, one hope, one calling, one baptism etc. Jesus said the little flock (Jewish believers) would have added to it a great crowd of other sheep not of that fold (Gentile believers), and they would become one flock under one shepherd. The Bible tells us enough to have faith to get us through to the point of Christ's second return and the awesome Day of Judgment that follows. We do not need to know what God's future plans for the earth are, nor how He will carry those plans out, nor who will do what. To be with Christ will be heaven. The location is insignificant. What God might, or might not do with regard to planet Earth is certainly in His will, but we do not need to know the details until such times as He chooses to divulge them to us.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Kind of got my doubts <br>  .<br>  Cause when Jesus sees the profit that He can make in the global market<br>  .<br>  After the people trashed it <br>  .<br>  Jesus will want ta stick around till the end <br>  .<br>  Ta get all He can out of His investment<br>  .|`|AA12193600	They will be sorely dissappointed when they discover the islamic fundamentalists have deflowered all the virgins.|`|d8zxbKduaa	The Bible doesn't really tell us, but it seems logical.

El ministro especificamente a la necesidad de cada uno, y lo hizo con acierto, porq solo de esta manera podia obtener el resultado deseado, q no era solamente "curar"  sino mas q eso, sembrar el reino de Dios en el corazon de c/persona  q con sus manos,  con sus palabras, o solo con una mirada, devolvia la salud.

Por lo general los sordos se desconciertan con facilidad, especialmente rodeados de una muchedumbre. Quizás Jesús nota la nerviosidad particular de este hombre. Por eso, compadeciéndose de él, lo aparta de la muchedumbre y trata con él en privado. Cuando están solos, Jesús indica lo que va a hacer. Pone los dedos en los oídos del hombre y, después de escupir, le toca la lengua. Entonces Jesús, mirando al cielo, suspira profundamente y dice: “Sé abierto”. Ahora el hombre puede oír, y puede hablar normalmente."(Marcos 7:31-37)<br>  <br>  él era tan compasivo con las personas que se fijaba en todos los detalles.

The trend that I see is a general disillusionment with the "business" face of organized religion. I've talked to a fairly significant number of people who emphasize the "organized" part when they talk about why they aren't "into" church and such, but then they qualify thier statement by saying that they are still "quietly spiritual" or something like that. <br>  <br>  Of course, within any given population, you are going to get those who want a "high intensity" spiritual experience, those who want a "low intenstity" one and a large majority in the middle. The seculariztion of public society I think has given an "easy out" to those on the lower end of the scale.<br>  <br>  Finally, I see this as a result not of society "growing up", but rather of becoming more childish - specifically more selfish. We are living an a society shaped by the "Me Generation" (I'm not sure you're old enough to remember the old ditty that got inserted between Saturday morning cartoons in the late 70s and early 80s: "You're the most important person in the world to you.") ANY system that asks the individual to think and act outside of self is going to be distasteful to that mindset including -- but not limited to -- religion. Most religions ask the beliver to do just that. Christianity in particular, with its calls to "turn the other cheek", "love your neighbor as yourself", "care for the poor and visit those in prison", etc. is NOT going to appeal to a "look out for Number One" mentality.<br>  <br>  It may in fact be a mark of intellectual honesty on the part of some people - not that they have "learned" that God is a fairy tale, but that they are willing to admit the requirement of being truly Christian is a hard one that they are not willing to take up.<br>  <br>  I also agree with "Wicked Warrior" above in that I think the sheer busyness of modern American society is part of the issue.   She calls it things that are more important; I'd call it a matter of priorities.  We have so much to do and so many distractions that something is going to fall by the wayside since despite our best efforts, there are still only 24 hours in a day.  Religion, especially for those for whom it was only a one hour a week committment and something they saw as merely an hour to sit through, is going to be an easy one to drop.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I see this trend paralleling the rise in discourtesy in our society. We are becoming less civil to each other in general. Religion used to provide an excellent moral training ground. Now are we supposed to rely on our failing public schools to instill a sense of civility in our young when they can barely manage math? I think it's too much to ask.<br>  <br>  You did ask for my thoughts ... :)|`|nEc0L0MRaa	If I had to guess they why of this, I would say because everywhere we turn, something is more important.  A lot of these things that are more important, contradict religious teachings.  The idea that it is more important to look a certain way than act a certain way.  <br>  <br>  Our inability to look at things from another point of view.  Personally I think the lack of a 3rd person point of view is a problem because in the past few generations, we have had less and less contact with animals.  Animals demand that you see things from their point of view, this teaches us to be more aware of others and as a result more respectful.  Horses weigh 1000lbs and move at 30mph with four chunks of iron on the ends of their feet.  You will respect them.<br>  <br>  Another reason is many people seem to look down on religious leaders.  Saying things like 'why don't you get a real job, you can't live off my money'  The job of a religious leader is to be well versed in their religion, and in many cases, other religions.  This person's job is to be an objective teacher, understanding, empathetic, and be available at all times of the day.  That is their job, it's a lot to handle, but Americans can be rather narrow minded and like to walk with blinders on.<br>  <br>  Wow that got long, sorry.<br>  <br>  Dance to the rhythm of Fire|`|angW1Lkfaa	Religions have become big business and people are finally catching on  to what is going on.

Those are all fancy ways of saying that my joints are misshapen and inflamed, and they, along with my muscles, are pretty painful.  <br>  <br>  What can being disabled for about another 40 years possibly teach me? Quite a bit, actually.<br>  <br>  First and foremost, I learned strength. One cannot know what one is made of until everything has been stripped away, and you are left with having to redefine yourself. <br>  <br>  Admittedly, that's a pretty scary thing, so add courage to the list of those things we have gained,  from that which we have lost.<br>  <br>  Next comes a hearty dose of appreciation. Why would I be thankful to have these diseases? Simple. I *don't* have cancer. Need I say more?<br>  <br>  Actually, appreciation goes much deeper than that. I learned to enjoy the smallest of things, and to never take anything for granted. Now that I can no longer sink into a warm bathtub filled with bubbles, I can look back and be thankful for the long, soaking baths I used to enjoy.<br>  <br>  It's the little things, Master B. They truly are what makes life worth living.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter that I can't do many of the things I once enjoyed. I'm still here, and I'm finding that, when I put my mind to it, I can accomplish all sorts of things I never would have given a second thought. So, let's add perseverance to the list.<br>  <br>  And patience. Can't forget that. I can no longer rush from here to there in pursuit of all I wish to do and accomplish. I am now forced to move slowly, and take time to smell the flowers.<br>  <br>  Which, in turn, brings me full-circle, and right back to appreciation of the little things.<br>  <br>  A good day to you, Master B.  Hope this was helpful.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADDED:<br>  <br>  I failed to answer your question. For the believers, I think they might feel that God hands out disabilities as a learning experience. Perhaps God knows best what it is we need, and how to reach our fullest potential. At least, that's my understanding. <br>  <br>  I don't know about any lesson plans their God might have, but I do know that only those who refuse to live and grow are disabled.

My name is Nick Vujicic and I'm 25 years old. I was born without arms or legs and given no medical reason for this condition. Faced with countless challenges and obstacles, God has given me the strength to surmount what others might call impossible. Along with that, the Lord has placed within me an unquenchable passion to share this same hope and genuine love that I’ve personally experienced with more than two million people all over the globe. <br>  <br>  Traveling extensively to over 19 nations, I've been extremely humbled by the continuous opportunities that the Lord has given me to share my testimony along with the hope that I have in Jesus with people in so many nations and situations. My greatest joy in this life is to introduce Jesus to those I meet and tell them of His great desire to get to know them personally by allowing Him to become their Lord and Savior. <br>  <br>  One of my favorite scriptures from the Bible is Psalm 139:17-18 that says, "How precious to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them! Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand.” <br>  <br>  God has used me to let people know in countless schools, churches, prisons, orphanages, hospitals, stadiums and in face-to-face encounters with individuals how very precious they are to God. Secondly, it’s my pleasure to assure them that God does have a plan for their lives that is purposeful. For God took my life, one that others might disregard as having any significance and filled me with His purpose and showed me His plans to move hearts and lives toward Him. Understanding this, though faced with struggles, you can overcome too. <br>  <br>  Be encouraged today as you read this promise from the Lord found in Jeremiah 29:11 of the Bible, "For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."|`|yPy4gFZ9aa	he obviously likes to torture...|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	First Reason: God Most High has made the garment of the body with which He has clothed man a manifestation of His art. He has made man to be a model on which He cuts, trims, alters and changes the garment of the body, thus displaying the manifestation of various of His Names. Just as the Name of Healer makes it necessary that illness should exist, so too the Name of Provider requires that hunger should exist. And so on...<br>  The Lord of All Dominion has disposal over His dominion as He wishes.<br>  Second Reason: It is by means of disasters and sicknesses that life is refined, perfected, strengthened and advanced; that it yields results, attains perfection and fulfils its own purpose. Life led monotonously on the couch of ease and comfort resembles not so much the pure good that is being, as the pure evil that is non-being; it tends in fact in that direction. <br>  Third Reason: This worldly realm is the field of testing, the abode of service. It is not the place of pleasure, reward, and requital. Considering, then, that it is the abode of service and place of worship, sicknesses and misfortunes-as long as they do not affect belief and are patiently endured-conform fully to service and worship, and even strengthen it. Since they make each hour’s worship equivalent to that of a day, one should offer thanks instead of complaining.|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	Yes, the sin curse is devastating mankind and the planet. But also, God has ordained suffering as a means of spiritual growth for us and to glorify Himself ultimately. God continually teaches His children that we remain dependent on Him, which we are. Man likes to think we don't need a God of any kind, or that He is a construct of the weak. But without His hand of mercy and long-suffering love towards the children of men being upon us day and night, we would then know what real suffering is all about, as will those who are seperated from His love and presence forever in the Great White Throne judgment.|`|yTAXDL5Jaa	oh please, some of us have disabilities other cannot see, liek me I am carryign around so much baggage from my childhood, if you could see it, you would look at me and say "WTFreak."

yAvTxh47aa	It's really common, because most things end up being made of polar molecules, and polar molecules will bounce around to form ordered structures- you can replicate snowflakes with compounds (and magnets) shaped like the H2O molecule with polar ends, and if you toss any molecule with a hydrophobic and hydrophillic end into water you get the same two shapes we see in the phospolipid bi-layer in our cells.|`|IYF4xSTdaa	you answered your own question...don't worry I do that to...yes the idea of order from disorder is impossible and is a matter of  perspective..|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	It is impossible.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ?|`|AA12193600	order from disorder is not only possible, it is commonplace.  The only thing that thermodynamics requires is that overall the disorder of a system must increase.  Plants for example can convert CO2 and H2O to sugar--a decrease in entropy. It requires energy to order things--in this case sunlight was the source of the energy.  Therefore one must consider the system to be the earth/sun system.  When one considers that--the increase in entropy in the sun producing the energy the plants used is far greater than the decrease in entropy the plants accomplished.  Overall the whole system increased in entropy.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	Its all a matter of focus, time scale, and perspective. On some levels in certain systems there is order but the order comes at a price of later chaos or disorder.

q7z7Ni3Daa	They may understand each other better, but it isn't related to how they speak. A non-native speaker, even if he or she is fluent and speaks English like a native, still has the opportunity to hear other non-native speakers more often. <br>  <br>  It's the hearing and getting accustomed to a variety of accents that helps them understand. It is not only for non-native speakers. Consider a Southerner who moves to Brooklyn or a person from Boston who moves to Mississippi. They will also have a hard time understanding for a while. Then, they will adapt. If those same people move again to a second place with a totally different accent, the time it takes them to adapt will be relatively less. <br>  <br>  The same goes for non-natives. The first time they hear accented English, it's hard to understand. After you talk to the 1000th person though, you pretty much know what the sounds mean when they are slightly different.<br>  <br>  =)|`|AA12152549	A thick accent does not mean that a person is not fluent in a language.

Pandavas win the war and got the kingdom and they ruled it for a long time. After that what happened to Arjuna and others? They were afraid of Kaliyuga and started walking towards the Northern side. On the way, they fell down one by one and died in the street...........What a shame!<br>  Everybody will have an end, no doubt. But why they were afraid of this Kali yuga? Is it not a name given to the Time? Again what is there to go towards the northern direction? Is this kali comes from the south? Why can't they stay in Hastinapura thinking that "let the Kalu Yuga come, what is wrong if we die. Our Body is Naswara (having an end) and not to worry about it. And Atma, the soul is eternal, nobody can harm it according to Krishna".<br>  Gita was not able to help Pandavas or Arjuna at their very essential time.

Is it justice?<br>  <br>  Here the opinion differs from person to person Logic is different versions.<br>  <br>  Take Ramayana also.How Rama Killed Vaali?<br>  <br>  Take the case of Kumbakarna and VIBHEESHANA. both are brothers of Ravana Both are indebted to Ravana as brothers and both know that<br>  Ravana is doing adharma. But what are their stands.Vibeeshana says that going to Rama alone is dharma,justice.Kumbakarna says that eventhough we know tht Ravana is unjust ,standing by them is brother darma food-shelter provider dharma.(Sorry I cannot bring wat I think in Tamil I am unable to bring it in Englsh So I tumble but anyhow I think you can understand my views.)<br>  <br>  So even great people are people in big posts they themselves have different versions about justice and dharma.Then ordinary men like me <br>  What we think we say correct what we wish is Justice what we do is Dharma.|`|J7KSKm54aa	Nice form.

Possibly that would be a first step before you question it. And, it was not written during our time. It says no where for people to go and eat children, God has no blood-he was never a human being. Jesus Christ was a human being, and Jesus is not God.

FOzN3xwzaa	Jesus came to save sinners.  We are all sinners. <br>  <br>  The only way to avoid hell, is by believing in Jesus for the forgiveness of your sins.  Believe now!<br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|aYY9dPVJaa	People today go to "hell" for not getting born again.

If your bf truly loves you, he will wait for you. If not, he will leave. If he leaves, you are better off, and you are CERTAINLY better off not marrying him.|`|HDbMh2YBaa	God will not send you to hell. You are forever in Christ once you believed. But God does not  promote sin. If you guys really love each other you should get married. Or even if you dont love each other that much, if you loved the Lord you would get married. I was in rebellion a long time and I was far away from the Lord. I married my wife knowing we didnt get along but that at least we would not fortnicate. And by faith I did it that perhaps we could grow together and please the Lord. Therefore you should push to get married soon to avoid sin. <br>  <br>  My life has been much better since I dont fortnicate every other day. It doesnt feel wrong after I have sex anymore. It is sanctified. It is a good feeling too. Knowing that God himself wont judge you wrong because you are doing right in his sight. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should spend lots and lots of time with him. Not too much but just enough to really get to know him. Really really know him. Then see how long it takes for you to beat each other's heads in. If it doesnt take long then you shouldnt get married. If it takes awhile then go for it. <br>  <br>  Marriage is more about forgiveness than anything. You will argue and have fights all the time. Both should learn how to apologize and forgive each other. It takes time. But get married and the Lord will not judge you. It will be  much better than continuing in sin. Sin leads to problems most times.|`|RTaimrg7aa	We'll congratulations sister you are a sinner.  I am too.  So is the rest of the world.

What just  happened before G-d says this? Moses complains to G-d and questions why He's doing the things he's doing.<br>  So what G-d in reality is saying to Moses is, "Look, Abraham didn't question my name [he didn't question me],no matter what happened, he was obedient, but you, with one hardship, one trouble already come complaining and willing to give up"<br>  <br>  So he's saying that he never had to explain or give reasons to Abraham but Moses is demanding it. That's what it means when it says that he didn't reveal to Abraham the way he did to Moses.
AA11139575	Stealing is a serious wrong and anyone doing this needs to face the consequences of this act. But the a consequence of stealing does not always have to be punishment. If what has been stolen is a minor thing, then some parents might choose to have the child to just apologize and then give back what was stolen.<br>  <br>   If it is a major thing like money, something expensive, valuable or what was vital for the person to not be without, or if this is a second offense, then punishment is called for. <br>  <br>  Now let's examine what happened with your child. This was the second time she stole. That  alone is grounds for punishment because she disobeyed your order not to steal again. Second, she stole money which is a serious thing to steal. That also calls for punishment. So, yes. You were right to punish her, given the circumstances. <br>  <br>  Try sharing some scriptures from the Bible that shows God's view of stealing and of those who disrespect authority. Exodus 20:15; 1 Corinthians 6:10 are good verses to share with her.|`|eXzUJbQJaa	Threatening and giving her a spanking, god that is awful, thats no way to deal to do with it. U really need to both sit down with and talk to her, and i mean talk to her NOT AT HER, ask her why she feels the need to take the money--is it because u aren't giving her pocket money (not to be urm rude or anything) or is it because she's seen her friends do it at school.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	Stealing is very serious, if she does it at 7, what is it going to be like as a teen, especially if she thinks all she has to do is apologize and she'll still get away with it?  Perhaps an object lesson is in order, and something important to her should disappear from her room.  If she asks about it, *shrug* "Gee sweetie, sorry to hear it's gone, maybe someone came into the house and stole it..." In any case, yeah, she needs to understand that her actions have consequences, if she steals beer from a store when she's 15, she could still be prosecuted for it, if she admits that she stole it, and the last thing you want is for her to get to that point in the first place. On another facet of it, how come she was afraid to ask for some spending money to go to town with her aunt?  Why did she feel she needed to steal it?  I'm not sure spanking is the best way, maybe confinement to her room / grounding for a set period of time, if she steals when she's older, she will be confined to a jail cell....|`|YuVSDBkzaa	Yes, she should still be punished because there are still consequences. When my daughter miss behaves, she is punished AND required to apologize. A little advice about children who steal; do EVERYTHING you can to nip this one in the butt because it will come back to haunt you!!! My sister has a problem with stealing (she is now 17 y/o) and it's a nightmare. She has lost three jobs because of it and everyone in the family has to keep their money and valuables hidden. It was a habit that started around the age of 5 and got much worse when she became a teenager. When she was younger, my mother would make her apologize to the entire family and the humiliation of it seemed to work...her stealing stopped for several years and then resurfaced when she was 12.<br>  <br>  Additional: I've decided with my daughter, if she gets caught steeling, she will have to repay the person back 7 times more. This was an idea from the Bible about the punishment for a person who steals.|`|wwdllMzYaa	ys, they have to learn consequences of actions<br>  you already seem to know the right thing to do<br>  <br>  any criminal can admit to their crime, but that doesnt make them stop it<br>  punishment does<br>  (not that im sugesting your daughter is a criminal, its just an example)|`|64d4893f2b5ad37e1908f80ec7b0c4c2aa	Spanking is barbaric and shows the parent's lack of control of the situation.<br>  <br>  Punishment is warranted even with an apology, depending on the infraction.

I never hit any of my children ever and not one ever stole.|`|ZSBZ83Dpaa	Since this was her second offense, since stealing is pretty serious, and since your husband had told that she would be spanked he was perfectly right to spank her. Evidently your daughter understood that she deserved this punishment. Hopefully her stinging butt will teach her a good lesson. You might have told her though that you appreciated her admitting what she did and that she would have been punished more severely if she had not.|`|ZleVRevVaa	Don't punish the child...|`|FWPSzFVhaa	This might sound crazy - but rather than hit her, try to use reverse psychology on her.   When she is not in her room, go in and take something you know she will look for - something that is a favorite item.    Then let her respond to it.   After she is upset enough, tell you that someone stole it from her.  Then let her digest that.   Then tell her you stole it from her.  Let her digest that and ask her how she feels each time.  Let her experience anger at you and hurt.   Then give it back and tell her you are sorry and ask her what she thinks about that. <br>  <br>  By doing this, you will reverse the action and allow her to safely experience what it is like to have someone steal from her.  Tell her that all those things she felt were the same things you felt when she stole from you.  Ask her if she wants mom and dad to hurt inside their hearts like that.  Tell her that being punished by the law or even mom and dad are not the worse parts of stealing.  Tell her that when she steals, she will have to go to sleep knowing that she made someone else's heart hurt.  And tell her that some people who make a habit of doing things like that to hurt others never sleep at night.
TjPwxbuJaa	Look, I am gay and I definitely had suicidal thoughts many years ago because of it. You see, my family had expectations of me, and I always wanted a family. I even got married.

I see my enemy come with blindfolded eyes and useless arms asking me for the blood of Jesus Christ and I won't give it to him, I ask of You, great Lord, to bring him to me subdued, conquered, at my feet, and discouraged, You have the power to conquer him if by the devil they try something against me, You won't allow it, if it were up to justice, he wouldn't win, if it were up to defenders, they will all deny him.

'But perhaps American.<br>  <br>  That is, you impress me as a United States American.<br>  <br>  Here I specify because everyone native to North, Central, and South America -- are in fact "Americans" -- all...<br>  <br>  'But 'that' is the way and dilemma of Americans [of the United States]; a mindset expressed in so stark a manner, so publicized over the course of so many years, and thus so direly felt and self-scrutinized more than any others of the western hemisphere and in particular in the USA that one has to just wonder how we all have not before imploded upon ourselves, that not only have we become citizens but as well like so many neutron stars devouring one another's gravities and spaces. <br>  <br>  Think about it: there is somewhat schizophrenic about the Americans of the United States; ever are they faced with an unceasing dilemma -- at the one moment running with the foxes and as quickly again hunting with the hounds.<br>  <br>  To be [U.S.A.] American is to be torn.  <br>  <br>  As to you being a racist, it is the following: Racism is like the punch that the figher does not see coming, which is the one that knocks him to the mat.  One cannot fancy racism in oneself as much as find oneself being caught doing a racist act, which heretofore he or she was wholly unconscious about.<br>  <br>  'Because racism is for the most part reflexive.  Multiply these many times among many people and the reflex grows to be thought completely normal -- that is, everybody does it!  <br>  <br>  We often do not know that we do not know.  Often is racism in the moment -- but not always does racism impress to others that way!  It is more subtle than one might expect because it is something that has not until a given moment and instance occurred that the normal is 'not' normal -- but instead simply taken for granted or agreed upon unconsciously [or consciously] so as normal.<br>  <br>  Tell me this.  In the year 2009, does it not strike anyone strange that on television broadcasts and cable, the overwhelming majority of actors, directors, producers, editors, and writers....are white?  'Or that in the U.S. American Legislative Branch, practically 100% of the U.S. Senators are white?  Or that well over 90% of all big businesses are owned, chaired, and managed by white people? 'Or that the whole of the legacies and histories of the USA are white?<br>  <br>  Even the manner in which we define cultures and ethnicities and races have been that which was designed by white people.  <br>  <br>  For example, there exists no such thing as a "light-complexioned" black person [ which falsehood derives from 18th Century racists, such as Thomas Jefferson, who set this sought of brainwashing machine in motion...  To wit: You cannot have a bone in your shoulder or skull, and be without the essential phosphorous or calcium that comprises bone -- and yet still expect the bone to remain to be bone without these two essentials.  It becomes something else without them.  What that would be we do not know, but surely no longer is it bone! <br>  <br>  If there is someone who is now light that was heretofore otherwise dark, then rest assured that he is not the one or the other, but rather both, or more, or neither.<br>  <br>  Technically, such categorizing as "light-complexioned" black persons has no truth or reality, but has become accepted as so; it has become "normal."  Somewhat a dumping ground...  If you can't figure it out, then categorize it as a "so and so" black person... or any category but white.  'Expediency.<br>  <br>  Pardon my use of black people as an example here.  But their circumstance has been such a dire example over the centuries...and we can draw the best sets of fallacies from the corruptions directed at this one ethnic grouping.<br>  [Even the grouping itself, however, is a white construction]<br>  <br>  'See how extreme this all is?<br>    <br>  Yet look at how many millions of people regardless of their respective races or ethnicities have bought in to this way of defining a human being, in particular in the United States -- which astounds many geneticists and general biologists even to this day.  <br>  <br>  As said above -- often, we do not know that we do not know.<br>  <br>  Now, these phenomena are too often thought easily explained away as but matters of causation, inertia; and that any challenge to this is thought still another demonstration by the so-called criers and "victims" and wise guys. <br>  <br>  Somehow such privilege does not yet strike those who possess these vantage points as strange.  But -- even to the coarsest observer this phenomenon should impress any sane being as totally strange and bizarre.    <br>  <br>  I tell you this.  If you 'are' racist -- you are not alone and do have the company of billions of other people.  You will be safe to say, however, that you 'are' a human being.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Look amigo I am white and I have an extreme dislike of "gangstas" be they black, white, asian or whoever. Where I live we say there are black people and (you figure it out) We have no problem with black people, hate (you figure it out). I agree with them, I have friends from all cultures. But I have no friends that are "gangstas", I have few people I don't like and that don't like me. But 100% of them are "gangsta" I think the term is changing to mean something else, I also think that we are starting to see an integration of our cultures. <br>  <br>  White people are not bad or even mean. Quite the contrary. You want to fit in and be friends do just that. Wear normal clothes that actually fit, and try to speak non slang English. Go and try it, and you will see that hey they aren't so bad. I have been to all 50 states and everywhere I go I find new friends of all colors and creeds. It is scary and the more you do it the more you will see the truth and the less you will be afraid. <br>  <br>  You are not racist, nor ignorant and don't let anyone tell you that. You realize you do not know, and seek to learn. That means you are part of the solution.

Also people swallowed every word she said, and this probably gave her the wrong kind of encouragement, resulting in her spouting a whole lot of Bilge. There were many more Occult groups, doing much more credible work, at the same time as her, such as the Golden Dawn, and a lot of their work, (especially Crowley's) still stands up today. Dion Fortune is probably the easiest to get your head around, (although her fiction, is a lot easier to understand than her theoretical work, and less prosaic in structure) and her offshoot Group, from the Golden Dawn, The Society of Inner Light, is still looked upon today as Valid and upstanding. (if outwardly a little Prissy)<br>  If you can overcome any preconceptions about what has been written Aleister Crowley, his work is probably the best and most Valid Spiritual writings, of the past 500yrs.

Never, ever, ever.<br>  <br>  But evolution is both a fact and a theory - just like gravity.<br>  <br>  Gravity is a fact: we can observe that matter attracts other matter in a manner proportionate to their masses and inversely proportionate to their distance. Gravity is also a theory: the theory is that there is a force called "gravity" which is responsible for this observed attraction.<br>  <br>  Evolution is a fact: we can observe populations of organisms change in their characteristics over time. And it is also a theory - the "Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection" - which takes this fact and explains how it happens (by natural selection).|`|AA11297267	Sorry, evolution *has* been proven.

Holding onto that myth in the face of such overwhelming evidence makes no sense of any kind.<br>  <br>  If you'd read and study some real science, you'd easily find all the evidence you need to see that evolution is a proven fact.

People who believe in evolution do not have to put faith in the science behind that theory. And there is a big difference between belief and faith. <br>  It is reasonable for me to believe an apple will fall to the ground when I drop it from my hand. It is reasonable because I have seen apples repeatedly fall to the ground when I drop them. I do not have to have faith the apple will fall. <br>  Faith is untested belief. Faith is what a person has to have in things that have no supporting evidence. I can believe in ghosts, God and the boogey man, but I have no evidence to support my belief. So, you don't really believe in ghost, God or the boogey man. You have faith in those things. <br>  And while the whole theory may not have been proven - insofar as we do not yet have fossilized remains of every single species of proto-humans to show a steady evolution of the species - there is more than enough scientific evidence to support the theory of evolution.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	Hardly.

There are no beliefs because the conclusions are backed up by objective evidence which all can examine.  Hence you will notice that scientists call evolution a theory, which is higher than what they call laws.  A scientific theory explains how things are the way they are.   Whereas laws are just predictable outcomes.<br>  <br>  Evolution, to date, has been supported by all the fossil record.  To date, there have been no evidence that contradicts it.  I would say that is a pretty good track record to be considered actually proven.  Scientists should disregard their own hopes, and form conclusions from the objective evidence.  <br>  <br>  Remember, truth is what it is, not what we hope it should be.|`|IR7e44yDaa	No, it's a scientific theory...|`|3CoHM0NJaa	In science, theories are accepted when the evidence clearly supports the theory.

When a man faithfully fulfills his role as head of his family, not only in discharging his obligations as breadwinner and provider of material needs, but also in caring for the spiritual needs of his family with loving and patient concern, he truly is a glory to God, the One in whose image and likeness he was created. (Gen. 1:26) He is also a blessing to his family, and certainly makes it a delight for the woman to fulfill her role as his helpmate and wife. In turn, by the wife’s recognizing her relationship to her husband, that he is her head, and by her honoring her head by faithful and loyal support of him, she becomes a glory to him.—1?Cor. 11:7.<br>  <br>   The woman can only be “man’s glory” as she holds her God-arranged relationship to the man, never by usurping the man’s headship. It is for this reason that circumstances may at times require the woman to wear a head covering. As we have seen in the previous issue of The Watchtower, Paul’s argument at First Corinthians chapter 11 on the need for a head covering is based on the principle of theocratic headship, which he stated at verse three: “The head of every man is the Christ [Jesus, not the congregation]; in turn the head of a woman is the man; in turn the head of the Christ is God.” So the head covering becomes necessary for a woman when she is performing some function or duty that normally should be performed by her husband or by a dedicated Christian man, and that she is performing in a temporary way or due to special circumstances. The important thing is not the head covering in itself, but the heart attitude and proper theocratic conscience of the woman wearing it. She appreciates that this is God’s arrangement, and wears the head covering primarily out of respect for Him and His theocratic arrangement of things as far as the sexes are concerned. A woman can have a good conscience in this matter only if, besides wearing the head covering at the appropriate time, she has a wholesome respect for the one whose headship is being honored thereby.|`|O9WVH9yhaa	No.  <br>  <br>  The head might be better off without a covering, so that you can connect to the universal life force through the top of your head.<br>  <br>  If you are to wear a covering, white is the color to go with, just for vibrational passage sake.<br>  <br>  Anyway.

VSDaQ9QOaa	Do you understand why you are confused? Its because no Church and<br>  no other people can tell you WHAT IS RIGHT OR BEST FOR YOU AND YOUR MATE.<br>  This is a very personal issue, personal between you, your mate and<br>  God himself.  God knows how you both feel about each other, and he<br>  knows what your intentions are.  In the eyes of God, do you really think you need the "marriage certificate" from the State in order for God<br>  to acknowledge your marriage to each other? <br>  <br>  Be together, be happy, and remember to keep God the Father as the<br>  head of your family.  Take care of each other - love, touch, help each<br>  other when times are hard or one of you is sick, do what you would<br>  do if you had the marriage certificate in your hand -  but use common<br>  sense:  if you are not ready to have a family, then wait to do that.<br>  God loves wisdom and common sense, so use them constantly.<br>  Keep private those things that only belong to you and your mate.<br>  IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE ALREADY MARRIED.  If you<br>  have any doubts about being together FOREVER, then ignore everything I've written; but if you are sure, then thank God for the one<br>  you love and keep the issue where it belongs - between you, your<br>  mate, and God.<br>  Remember that some Churches have a way of keeping people in<br>  bondage to guilt - YOU ARE FREE IN CHRIST and if any person or<br>  Church system is holding you in any kind of bondage to anything, then<br>  somebody is lying to you.  Do you know what God wants? He wants<br>  you to be happy.  Do you know what he wants you to offer up to him?<br>  Your love.  Not your guilt, not your worry, JUST YOUR LOVE.  <br>  So be happy, take care of the ones you love, and love and thank<br>  God for it.   All is well, God is on the Throne, and He is your heavenly<br>  Father - the closest relative you have.  He is not looking to condemn<br>  you for loving your partner.|`|aYY9dPVJaa	Intimacy is always best reserved for a commited relationship, like marriage. However, marriage is really designed for those who believe, and continue to believe for and in their marriage.<br>  Generally, maybe in 99 of 100 cases, it is best to wait until marriage to have sexually intimate contact, but it may be that this can be considered in a case by case manner.<br>  For the woman, having sexual relations outside of marriage can leave her very vulnerable to criticism and shame (concerning other peoples knowledge of it), and for the man, may cause him to actually feel less or even against his partner in some ways.<br>  I recommend discretion in these decisions, and count the cost and consider all the ramifications of what you are doing.

They have to do their jobs.  As for other people, they will tell you different answers depending on what they see right and wrong.  Myself, I'm 47 and I am a Catholic(Christian for people who still don't know) and I believe that if you're in a committed relationship and have been for a while, that it's okay to touch or even more.  We are just human beings and men expect a lot more today than they did before.  It's all about your conscience and how you feel about it.  As for the people who will judge you, they're sinning too since you shall not judge.  Just do what is right for you.  It doesn't make you an hypocrite because you don't follow everything the Church tells you to do.  I'm a sinner as well as all human beings in the world and I go to Church.  It help me since I need guidance in every aspect of my life.  Personally I don't believe in one night stands but some will tell you it's okay as long as you regret it.  They forget that you're not supposed to do it again if you regret.  I, for one, find that it is a lot more morally right to sleep with one person you love and loves you than to have one night just for the pleasure of it.
jnnIwdtyaa	Merry Meet,<br>  <br>  As per your question, a High Priestess is traditionally the physical representation of the Goddess in circle. She usually holds the status of 3rd degree in most Covens or Circles within Wicca, but this is not always the case.<br>  <br>  Commonly there are 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degrees within the Wiccan Coven or Circle. Though in today’s world Wicca is starting to have the additional 4th and 5th degrees! Most of the time a degree is awarded to a Priestess or Priest in a Coven or Circle depending upon skill, knowledge and ability. But again this is traditional, but you will come across groups with a person in a degree that really did not earn the degree based on skill, knowledge or ability. Those Priestesses and/or Priests usually attain there degree due to necessity or lack of local people who are skilled or knowledgeable. <br>  <br>  Basically, Wicca is an earth based religion focusing on nature as well as the Goddess and God.  Now according to today’s definition, Paganism is simple a belief system that does not follow main stream religions.

For our coven, there are only Initiates, Witches and the HP/HPS.  <br>  <br>  All Wiccans are Pagans, but not all Pagans are Wiccans.  Wicca is a single faith, essentially, with a great deal of variation depending upon the individual and the tradition the individual adheres to.  Paganism, however, is a far broader term encompassing dozens and dozens of different faiths and practices, and traditions, of which Wicca is merely one.  Most Pagans are nature-based, but beyond that, Pagans vary extremely broadly.  There are polytheistic faiths, pantheistic practices, anamistic practices, duo theistics, monotheists and even atheists which fit comfortably under the umbrella term of Pagan.|`|PRAd6MWwaa	she's basically one of the leaders of the coven, along with the high priest.<br>  not sure if there are others, i'm solitary.<br>  the difference is Paganism is an umbrella term for all the "earth based" religions.

There were the dietary laws and insular customs. Paul was upset when he saw others that would act differently around their fellow Jews, ignoring the gentiles when they were present.  Paul while in Jerusalem rebuked Peter for shunning the Gentiles by getting up from eating with Gentiles when a group of Jews came in. (See Gal. 2:11-14) This shows that even Peter, who have been used to take the Gospel to the Gentile Cornelious (Acts 10-11) did not fully understand or had not totally accepted the Gentiles as equal with the Jews in the churches. <br>   Conflict between the Jews and Gentiles began to emerge as the church at Antioch grew, and many Gentiles were saved. The Gentiles had no background in the Old Testament Levitical laws and their practice of eating meat sacrificed to idols and which contained blood greatly offended the Jews. The Jerusalem council of Acts 15, addressed the matter setting special guidelines for the Gentile believers which would not offend the Jews and bring unity.|`|h11oTtQraa	I'll see if I can answer this correctly:<br>  <br>  Jewish communities were around the Roman Empire. The Romans were quite tolerant of Jewish Tradition and Culture. The one day, a unknown Prophet named Jesus was going around proclaiming he is the son of God. Therefore, the jewish community was like. "No way, you false prophet, can you be the son of God"..They felt that this was an immediate threat with a person by the name of Jesus who had 12 followers. So, in this case, they knew no better and was scared that this guy was going to poison everyone's minds and lead them away from God. In so doing, Romans were annoyed by it because Jewish communities were unsettled and Romans didn't want deal with the crap. So eventually, the whole story goes that Jesus was betrayed and sent to the cross and dead..blah blah.<br>  <br>  <br>  NOW, the Christian religion becomes somewhat known around the Roman Empire. Small groups of believers start to take on the faith and like i said, Romans were pretty tolerant but what they didn't like was the organized way of their religion.

Jesus died on Wednesday afternoon, not Friday. Good Friday was adopted from a pagan holiday, like many of the Christian holidays today.

Christ died on Friday afternoon, Nisan 14, 33?C.E. His body was placed in a tomb before sunset of that day. Nisan 15 began that evening and ran until sundown of Saturday, the seventh and last day of the week. At that time Nisan 16 began and ran its course until sunset of what we call Sunday. Consequently, Jesus was dead and in the tomb for at least a period of time on Nisan 14, was entombed throughout the entire day of Nisan 15, and spent the nighttime hours of Nisan 16 in the tomb. When certain women came to the tomb on Sunday morning, he had already been resurrected.—Matthew 27:57-61; 28:1-7.<br>  Jesus was in the tomb for parts of three days.

KticTfYPaa	Wow thats a question and a half. In short no one JW or otherwise have a certain future. Jehovah reads hearts and also understands circumstances. What he does ask is that you exert yourself and do your best. Depending on what is going on in your life at this time that may not be as much as you may have done in the past.<br>  <br>  In regard to your second question Jehovah can maneuvre events to cause his will to pass BUT mankind has free will so your life choices are down to you. I can't be really specific as you have not told us what your problem is but please remember Ecclesiastes 9:11 says<br>  <br>  ?I returned to see under the sun that the swift do not have the race, nor the mighty ones the battle, nor do the wise also have the food, nor do the understanding ones also have the riches, nor do even those having knowledge have the favor; because time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all.<br>  <br>  We are not fated so If there is family illness etc it is not caused by God. <br>  <br>  I would suggest you make contact with you local congregation elders or whoever you studied with and they may be able to give you more specific help.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|FBrwlhPtaa	According to the JW's, you won't have a chance in Hell at Heaven. They believe only 144,000 JW's make it in. There are millions of JW's today. What do you think are your chances of getting in??<br>  <br>  I would suggest you convert to Christianity. EVERYONE gets a chance to enter Heaven. BTW, the 144,000 are the Jews God "marks" during the Great Tribulation!|`|c898150558ddb7ef0e50782e0a5d05b4aa	Correct, the symbolic mark of the beast is permanent and results in God's irreversible condemnation, it is not possible for anyone with the mark of the beast to ever repent and gain Jehovah's approval. Clearly, then, no one has the mark of the beast yet. Otherwise, it would be impossible for anyone who has ever supported the political system in the past to repent and receive salvation.<br>  <br>  Jehovah is the God of Justice. His judgments are not random. His judicial decision decrees the sentence of permanent death for everyone that worships the wild beast or its image after the point at which the beast revives and its image miraculously comes to life—because doing so at that time will demonstrate an unequivocal rejection of Christ as ruler.<br>  <br>  What that means is the Anglo-American head of the beast suffering the prophetic death-stroke does not occur until a future event rather then the previous WW1.

Which was manipulated by Bill Clinton and the 90's Congress...<br>  <br>  It STARTED in 1907 when Credit Default Swaps caused a recession and were made illegal... It continued in the 1990's when Bill Clinton and the 90's Congress made Credit Default Swaps LEGAL AGAIN... Even after they caused a Recession JUST LIKE THIS ONE.<br>  <br>  Then Wall Street got in to Speculation... That led to Speculating on Oil and THAT caused the price of petroleum to go through the roof... Which dragged down the rest of the nation by causing a spike in prices for ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING made with petroleum or shipped by truck, air, or sea...<br>  <br>  NOW this retard Obama is bringing back the Clinton White House to go on a spending spree to make things worse...

What we're seeing now is the failure of the Subprime Mortgage Market (AKA Subprime Mortgage Crisis), which was a direct result of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1995 (CRA1995) that was signed into law by President Bill Clinton.<br>  <br>  CRA1995 forced banks to use a point based system to determine the eligibility of applicants for home loans, with the three biggest points values coming from their area of residence, their race, and their income. <br>  <br>  The Community Reinvestment Act (or CRA, Pub.L. 95-128, title VIII, 91 Stat. 1147, 12 U.S.C. § 2901 et seq.) is a United States federal law designed to encourage commercial banks and savings associations to meet the needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.[1][2][3] The Act was intended to reduce discriminatory credit practices against such neighborhoods, a practice known as redlining.[4] The Act requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agencies to encourage regulated financial institutions to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered, consistent with safe and sound operation. (See full text of Act and current regulations.[1]) To enforce the statute, federal regulatory agencies examine banking institutions for CRA compliance, and take this information into consideration when approving applications for new bank branches or for mergers or acquisitions.[5]|`|eHfEh85zaa	not a full depression but most will not be satisfied unless a celebrity|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I think we will be in a major recession.. it will probably be at its height during 2009 and 2010.

787a1681b3bc0562d41e1707b178a8a5aa	Art and culture cannot be separated.  Art reflects culture, and a culture is partly defined by its art.<br>  <br>  Here is a definition I made for myself (not from the dictionary) when I was taking an introductory art class:<br>  <br>  "Art is the visual expression of the ideas, experiences, customs, products, or values of a society, an era or an individual.

It stands on The Mall, the processional route linking Buckingham Palace with Trafalgar Square.<br>  Costing two million pounds (2.9 million dollars, 2.3 million euros), it was paid for by the sale of coins marking her daughter Queen Elizabeth II's 80th birthday.<br>  "This particular sculpture is her national monument and shows her in majesty -- it's her as queen Elizabeth," said Jackson.<br>  The statue is flanked by two 11-foot (3.35-metre) long friezes by artist Paul Day.<br>  The first shows a wartime scene with the king and queen visiting bombed-out Londoners, with the second showing elements of her life as queen mother such as meeting veterans, at the races and with her corgi dogs.<br>  Day said: "She is with the king in one panel and is the widower queen mother in the other and depicted to a certain extent as the grandmother of the nation."|`|g4lLX3iaaa	Prince Charles did and it did not cost 2 million pounds either.The statue that is going to cost the 2 mil is of a huge horse to be place in Kent and the taxpayer is going to pay for that monstrosity.|`|ed658ab54221fdf8e76c9f6718308484aa	A complete waste of money whoever paid for it,,the money would have been better spent at Great Ormond street hospital,,life is for the living and not for statues of old ladies with bad teeth|`|AElFESKVaa	you did|`|ToztjpAsaa	Apparently the GBP 2 million that it cost was raised by sales of a commemorative GBP 5 coin issued for the Queen's 80th birthday.|`|fI967FOCaa	Prince Charles.

RermzbWgaa	Huh?<br>  <br>  I believe Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone) is a correct principle...but I have no idea what you are talking about.|`|ObLMLZ74aa	First?  I'd have to say Catholics.  The Protestants and Catholics have been fighting for a long, long time.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	The primary Catholic argument against sola scriptura is that the Bible does not explicitly teach sola scriptura. Catholics argue, “the Bible nowhere states that it is the ONLY authoritative guide for faith and practice.” While this is true, it fails to recognize a crucially important issue. We know that the Bible is the Word of God. The Bible declares itself to be God-breathed, inerrant, and authoritative. We also know that God does not change His mind or contradict Himself. So, while the Bible itself may not explicitly argue for “sola scriptura,” it most definitely does not allow for traditions that contradict its message. Sola scriptura is not as much of an argument against tradition as it is an argument against unbiblical, extra-biblical and/or anti-biblical doctrines. The only way to know for sure what God expects of us is to stay true to what we know He has revealed – the Bible. We can know, beyond the shadow of any doubt, that Scripture is true, authoritative, and reliable. The same cannot be said of tradition.|`|RGe6Et0Xaa	Having met thousands of them, I can't see them sending anyone to the camps.

XN0cYCATaa	Since Adam lived several hundred years, having lots of children was not a problem. The Genesis account does not tell us about the order of the births nor does it tell us how old they were. By having many children it is certainly possible that there were many women around. This would mean that Cain married either a sister or a niece or some other relation. Of course at this point, the question of inbreeding is raised. But it is not a problem early on in the human race because the genetic line was so pure.

pWkhW6daaa	Considero que si me paso lo que comentas y la verdad me alegra que me haya pasado. Pienso que no es nada malo ni fuera de lo normal. Creo que es el mismo proceso por el cuál Tomas al que llaman incrédulo paso, cuando no creyó sin ver a Jesús (Juan 20:24-29). Yo recupere la fe, buscando a fondo en la Biblia y pidiéndole a Dios que me mostrara claramente la Verdad. La Biblia dice hablando de la sed de buscar a Dios,. "Al que tiene, se le dará más; al que no tiene, hasta lo que cree tener se le quitará." Sigue buscando y encontrarás, pero si dejas de buscar hasta las ganas de buscar se te quitarán.

9xBvT9O3aa	huy esa es una situacion complicada y te lo digo por experiencia, yo me case con un catolico y a mi me criaron desde ni?a en el cristianismo, mi suegra es de las organizadoras del catequismo en la ciudad donde vive y mi mama es ministro de una iglesia cristiana. <br>  En primer lugar te digo que he sido muy feliz durante casi 8 a?os y si se puede tener un matrimonio con alguin de otra religion, es complicado por las familias ,pues en general tanto de un lado como del otro se desconocen las creencias de cada uno, y se tienen muchas creencias erroneas, que si los catolicos son borrachos y golpeadores, que si los cristianos se la pasan con la biblia en la mano y se intercambian a las esposas etc etc, cada quien da su punto de vista y opinan lo que desconocen, lo unico cierto es que si se quieren y estan dispuestos a aceptarse el uno al otro sin querer imponer sus creencias y respetandose mutuamente pues se puede llevar una vida en pareja saludable. Solamente que tienen que platicar mucho y ponerse de acuerdo en cosas que los demas dan por hecho sin pensarlas, por ejemplo en que van a hacer con los hijos en caso de que decidan tenerlos y les recomiendo qure lo platiquen antes de enseriarse y comprometerse a algo mas pues despues esos detalles si no se platican con tiempo y se toman acuerdos son puntos de constane conflicto.<br>  Yo tengo un hijo y mi esposo y yo decidimos ense?arle que hay un Dios que lo ama y lo cuaida independientemente de que religión tenga, en ocaciones lo llevamos al culto cristiano y en ocaciones a misa, y al contraio de lo que muchos puedan pensar el ni?o esta muy claro respecto a la religión de sus papas y a que el podra decidir cuando el sea grande sobre que religión tomar y nosotros lo respetaremos en esa desicion. Date tiempo para conocer la religión de tu novio y que el se de la oportunidad de conocer la tuya para que asi ninguno de los dos tenga problema a la hora de compartir con el otro eventos y situaciones religiosas que son importantes para todos. por ejemplo a tu novio no le gustaria asistir solo a la boda de su mejor amigo a la iglesia cristiana y a ti no te gustaria asistir sola al bautiso de tu sobrinito, solo por que no se pusieron de acuerdo en que hacer si esos casos se les peresentaban.<br>  Tener una relacion e dificil. pero creeme tener una relacion con alguien de otra religión es mucho mas dificil si no se esta muy conciente de la prefeencia del otro y se acepta y ama tal como es. al final de cuentas lo que digan los demas y las dos familia pues escuchenlos pero no les hagan demasiado caso solo a su corazón.<br>  Piensa bien si amas a esa persona tanto como para compaginarlo todo y si es asi pues adelante y hasle caso a tu corazon y a ser feliz en la vida que es lo importante.|`|DR2LJV2Eaa	El no debe casarse contigo.

Aqui no se trata de religiones por que el cristianismo no es una religion, solo se trata de vivir como Dios lo dice en su palabra, es cambiar de modo de vida.<br>  El hacerte cristiano no lleva a un rito o algo parecido para serlo, es solo que recibas a JESUCRISTO como tu UNICO SALVADOR, PERO UNICO EH!!!

d1badddc7b62c26e2772ebcabfb316d0aa	It depends on your reasons for learning a foreign language, and also where you live.  I studied German in high school, then got a bachelors degree in it, because I wanted to do something different from what most people do.  I've never regretted it, as it allowed me to spend my junior year of college studying in Germany, and now I speak, read and write a language none of my friends can.  The downside is that it's hard for me to find people to practice with.  I've also studied French (two semesters) and picked up quite a bit of Spanish just by living in Southern California, and I find both of those easier to learn than German.<br>  <br>  If you live in an area with many Spanish speakers, Spanish would be easiest to practice.  Be aware, however, that you will study academic Spanish in school, which is as different from everyday Spanish as academic English is different from how most of us actually speak.<br>  <br>  French is a good middle road--not as complicated to learn as German, not as "ordinary" as Spanish.  Again, however, your opportunities for practice may be limited.|`|lShJ6S8saa	well I'm wondering why everybody is saying "yeah take German it's so easy" I'm a native speaker and I honestly wouldn't want to learn it.. course we have some words that are similar toEnglishh but we have many irregular verbs and for every person (I, you, he, she and so on) we have a different form, for example: go=gehen<br>  ich gehe, du gehst, er/sie/es geht, wir gehen, ihr geht, sie gehen<br>  I also would learn French.. I don't like them :) in French a lot depends on the pronunciation. word change their meaning if you say it in the wrong way<br>  <br>  do it like me and take Spanish! I'm learning since september and I'm loving it! some of the word are very similar so english:<br>  to offer = ofrecer<br>  the page = la pagina<br>  the color = el color<br>  grammar isn't that hard, too<br>  <br>  Good luck with your chioce!|`|dOOQi5pKaa	it depends on your goal<br>  <br>  Spanish is the most practical for living in the US, it's 2nd most common to english<br>  <br>  i feel German is most similar grammatically and many words are very similar. i think it may be simpler (ie, Beer = Bier, pronounced the same way)<br>  <br>  and I would think French would be the biggest challenge, but would be best for someone who is interested in traveling to Europe and interested in "romantic" things ;)|`|C8QTGBYxaa	hi,<br>  depends where u live.

It also is a great qualification for college and also for jobs -- you are most likely to get a job if you can speak Spanish rather than French or another language.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|vbO5WD2Haa	Living in the US I would say Spanish.

It harms no life in the process and many of those properties can be used without using an embryo. <br>  <br>  For me, Michigan's law recently passed has one key clause in it that concerns me very deeply. It passed, but with a clause that no laws or changes can be made to restrict stem cell research, but there is no similar clause in the bill that passed that prevents changes to research that may not be ethical. So, let's say that the guidelines change to allow for testing to be done on older embryos (over 14 days), no laws can be placed on that research to restrict it.|`|SSsCOIrqaa	I guess it depends on whether women start conceiving and aborting babies so they can sell the embryos for "science".

That doesn't happen until we are older in many cases! Even a lot of 12 and 13 year olds don't understand that we shouldn't do stuff because it is just plain wrong - they understand that we shouldn't do things because we'll get in trouble. I don't know if the age of accountability is the same for everyone or if people all have their own unique age. There is speculation that it's 18 or 20 because of a passage in the Old Testament.

All will be raised to live a life correctly instructed by God of the right way to live.  God will pour out his spirit on ALL flesh (Joel 2:28, Acts 2:17).  And they will be judged upon their way of life, their willingness and effort in following God's Way (Revelation 20:12).<br>  <br>  Judgment is not like a court setting, where everyone stands before a bench receiving sentence.  God judges us on our actions.  Just as the saints are being judged in this life by their actions (1 Peter 4:17), so too will the rest of mankind be judged by its actions in living every day, but not before they are given the truth to live by.<br>  <br>  So, in the Judgment, babies, teens, children and adults, will be raised to life again, taught correctly the Bible and its truth and they will grow old in the truth.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 65:20 -- "No more shall an infant from there live but a few days, Nor an old man who has not fulfilled his days; For the child shall die one hundred years old, But the sinner being one hundred years old shall be accursed. <br>  <br>  From this Scripture (and a few others), it is believed that the "Judgment Day" will last about 100 years.<br>  <br>  And in that day, those who teach God's Word  (open the "Books" -- Revelation 20:12) will make themselves visible to humanity:<br>  Isaiah 30:20 -- And though the Lord gives you The bread of adversity and the water of affliction, Yet your teachers will not be moved into a corner anymore, But your eyes shall see your teachers. <br>  .|`|XpZumlkwaa	God knows about your child better than you.<br>  What do you really think God will do to your baby?<br>  Get into the Word more and learn of God.<br>  <br>  All parents should start teaching their children at least at the age of 12.<br>  The Bible always give us guide lines to follow when it comes to examples of Yeshua (Jesus).<br>  <br>  At 12, He already had a commited life.<br>  Luke 2: 41- (49)-52 .

Be warned you teenagers. Sin before 20!!!! What a load of crock.<br>  <br>  <br>  There seems to be no limit to the crock people will post about  religion.

God is called the "cardio-knower" because he can read the<br>  heart and mind; He knows each of his children and he knows which<br>  are old enough and able of mind to be accountable for their actions.<br>  God will Judge with fairness, and He will only pass Judgement on those who are able to be accountable.  Obviously, infants, toddlers,<br>  and even a person who is age 60 but who is not able to be accountable, WILL NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.  For example,<br>  if you are mentally retarded at the age of 60, you obviously cannot be<br>  held accountable when your mind is that of a 5-year old child.<br>  The important thing to understand is that God is fair, and He knows<br>  who is and who is not accountable.<br>  <br>  Next, it felt like I was being stabbed in the heart when I read the rest<br>  of your post that asks how God can judge your children if He takes them away before you are able to teach them.  THIS IS WHERE I<br>  HAVE TO EMPHASIZE TO YOU THAT GODS JUDGEMENT IS NOT<br>  BEING TAUGHT PROPERLY or according to the Scriptures.  This<br>  is why:<br>  <br>  You probably hear preachers and others stating that you had better get<br>  yourself saved before Christ returns, because if you don't, you'll be spending the rest of eternity in hell's horrible fires.  Do you know what<br>  God likens this hellfire and brimstone message to?  He states clearly<br>  that it reminds him of molech practice.  That was where they would make a huge bon-fire and then throw infants and very young children into the burning fire as a sacrifice.  God teaches us that when you <br>  suggest to someone that their heavenly Father will throw them into<br>  fire and burn them, its just like molech practice and HE HATES IT.<br>  God tells us that this idea of burning people NEVER ONCE ENTERED<br>  HIS MIND.  It is a thought of man, certainly not of God.<br>  <br>  So what DOES happen?   This is what the Manuscripts tell us:<br>  <br>  When Christ returns, He ushers in a 1000-yr period of teaching and disipline. At that time of His return, all of us, good and bad, ALL of us will be instantly changed back into our spiritual bodies:  but some will<br>  realize that although they are in their spiritual body, they still have a<br>  soul that is mortal (liable to die).   This 1000-yr teaching period is not<br>  a second chance, but only because God knows that there are a myriad of reasons a person cannot find real truth in the flesh, whether<br>  it be because of false teachings or some other reason.  Many of those<br>  who are being told they are headed for hell are actually headed for a<br>  classroom.  They will be TAUGHT, NOT BURNED.<br>  <br>  No person is judged until after this teaching period expires, and nobody will be in any kind of burning pit throughout that millenial period.  Even Satan himself, who has already been judged and found<br>  guilty, is not in a burning hell - he's at the throne of God being held<br>  by Michael.<br>  <br>  When the Great Judgement is completed, those who are found guilty,<br>  will follow Satan into the "Lake of Fire", which is able to destroy both the spiritual body and the soul. It will take only as long as it does to step into it, and be turned to ashes from within.  Even the memory of<br>  you would be gone, as if you never existed at all, which is why it is<br>  written that nobody will weep for you when you are gone.<br>  Then, and this is very important:  then, even the Lake of Fire itself<br>  is DONE AWAY WITH.  Nobody fries like bacon screaming and begging for mercy for all eternity: it is simply not written. There will be<br>  nothing in the eternity that offends, and that means NOTHING, naida,<br>  zip, ziltch, zero.  <br>  People do not understand what they are reading, esspecially idioms or<br>  figures of speech so commonly used in the Greek.  <br>  <br>  Am I saying that there is no eternal fires so we can get away with anything?  Hardly.  Judgement will be sure, and nobody will be getting<br>  away with anything.  But the truth of Gods Word is that either you make it to the eternity, or you don't because you will be GONE.<br>  <br>  Don't ever forget this one thing:  your children are not only yours, but<br>  they are God's also:  He does not want to see even one of his children<br>  lost.  If a child of yours dies before you can teach them, they are with<br>  the Father and they are being taught in a way that you could never have taught them, and so they are in better standing than you are,<br>  believe me.  Who would be the better teacher, you or Christ and the<br>  Angels?  "To be absent from the flesh, is to be present with the Lord".<br>  I understand your concern, because I've lost a daughter.  <br>  Those who are now with the Lord are fine, but they are hoping that<br>  you don't dwell on them, and instead work on those who are still here<br>  in the flesh.<br>  All is well, and Gods plan is moving forward perfectly.  Don't <br>  worry.

It is abundant and blessed. Nothing can harm it or destroy it. It is better to live by the Law of the Lord rather than in this world. God will destroy the world and everything in it. Then where will your fun be? It isnt fun to disobey the Lord. It only seems that way during it. Its like maybe having a threesome with two women(I havent had that but I can imagine). It probably feels like the greatest thing in the world, but in your heart you know its wrong. Or maybe it would be fun to go rob a bank for a billion dollars and escape to Mexico to live life happily ever after.

I don't consider it living by the law, I just consider it living in the manner in which God has set for us to having a happy and fulfilling life.  What I truly regret are those stupid things that I did.  What fun are hangovers.  Just plain having sex with whoever you pick up at a bar is really not as fulfilling as having someone in which you can truly be intimate with who's first responsibility is pleasing you and not using you for a quick lay.  I don't consider my life boring since I can actually enjoy life and not worry if I'm gonna wrap my car around a telephone pole on the way home from the nightclub.  I feel that those who live this lifestyle don't know what they are missing.|`|yzRHAWNhaa	Not all Christians started out like the Brady bunch you know.

That's like the Scripture states:<br>  <br>  M't:23:24: Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.<br>  <br>  But to each their own, Personally I want to spend eternity in paradise instead of Death Valley.<br>  <br>  Jos:24:15: And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD. ? ? ? ?|`|pLZlWmeZaa	No not really all that i have been taught to abstain from is for my own protection like waiting to have sex till I'm married saves me from much hurt with failed relationships and stds so no not really.

There are many things that could happen at those parties like getting arrested, getting in fights, or even getting shot. The bible is not just a book, it's the word, life. I feel that you are trying to understand us a little, but there are such things as cool and popular christians. But sex is so much more than just it's name. You share a bond with that person, it's sacred, it's supposed to be saved for marriage. That way you do not have to worry about getting any diseases, getting pregnant or getting someone pregnant. I've experienced some of the "worldly life"  you are talking about and it just does not compare to a christian life. Living a christian life is so much better. I don't have to worry about things, I can just give them to God. He takes care of my battles for me. God is not an evil being, and the bible doesn't have evil meanings. Where did you get that from??????  I just don't understand why some people think that. For me life a christian lifestyle is not and has never been a mistake. God loves all of us.|`|h53UJhqhaa	you can be cool and popular and still be a christian, it isn't an oxymoron. we just don't have fun by sleeping with random people. we still have fun with our other christian friends. so it really depends what your definition of fun is. <br>  being a christian is definitely not a mistake. i see alot of things go wrong in my non-christian friends lives, and i don't envy them in the least. even though they go out and have "fun" drinking, partying, etc. <br>  and the Bible isn't full of silly magical sayings. we believe that we go to heaven when we die if we live a life that is pleasing to God. and heaven is 100x better than anything on earth, so why not live a good life now, and be rewarded for eternity, than live a "fun" life of sex parties and go to hell and suffer for eternity?

Didnt you read about the parable of the choked seeds and the ones that we're dried up and so forth?|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The words of Paul in the Bible are not the word of Paul, but they are the Words of Jesus. <br>  <br>  That should answer your question.|`|kc1IBYMRaa	Paul's perversion of Jesus' message and the meaning of Jesus' life was largely due to his hatred of women and his ungratifiable lust for Timothy.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	No. He was a True Apostle & Saint, who led us all to Christ Our Lord.|`|houWY7qvaa	Paul was a man with weaknesses, like any of us but contributed to telling something of relevance in his writings or they wouldn't have been.  Not only do the verse or scripture tell something, but the writer's themselves have a story relevant to today, regarding themselves in relation to what is happening today with some.|`|FpMS47sXaa	Yes, he was.<br>  <br>  Funny how people pay no attention that his words are in direct contradiction to Jesus.<br>  <br>  Paul never knew Jesus. He claimed to have had a vision, but that was HIS claim. <br>  <br>  He very well could have lied, yet people will listen to someone that have never met, nor know anything about his person's character, nor does this person have any evidence or proof that he is an "apostle" of Jesus - but still his words have more value and merit than the words of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Sad, really when you think about it.
DtlQawvgaa	Like all non-Christian cults, the Jehovah's Witness organization distorts the essential doctrines of Christianity. It denies the deity of Christ, His physical resurrection, and salvation by grace. This alone makes it non-Christian. To support its erring doctrines, the Watchtower organization (which is the author and teacher of all official Jehovah's Witness theology), has even altered the Bible to make it agree with its changing and non-Christian teachings.<br>  <br>  Typical with cults that use the Bible to support its position is a host of interpretive errors:<br>  <br>  Taking verses out of their immediate context. <br>  Refusing to read verses in the entire biblical context. <br>  Inserting their theological presuppositions into the text. <br>  Altering the Biblical text to suit their needs. <br>  Latching onto one verse to interpret a host of others. <br>  Changing the meanings of words. <br>  Proclaiming some passages to be figurative when they contradict their doctrines. <br>  Adding to the Word of God. <br>  <br>  Additionally, the Jehovah's Witness organization requires of its members regular weekly attendance at their "Bible Study" meetings where they are repeatedly indoctrinated with anti-Christian teachings. This is done by reading the Watchtower magazine, following along with what it says, reading the questions it asks, and reciting the answers it gives. In other words, the Watchtower Organization carefully trains its members to let the Organization do their thinking for them. <br>  <br>  <br>  The Witnesses are told they will be persecuted when they go door to door teaching their doctrines. They are further told that this is simply the enemy fighting against God's organization because they are in "the truth." So, when someone disagrees with them, they are conditioned to reflect on what the Watchtower has told them. They then feel confirmed in being in God's true organization on earth (like all cults claim). They are strongly encouraged to have friends and acquaintances that are only JW?'s, thereby keeping outside examination to a minimum. They are told to shun those who leave their group, that way, there is no way to see why someone has left and no way to find out that they are in error from those who have found the truth in Christ. They are conditioned to shy away from any real biblically knowledgeable person. Critical examination of their doctrines is not encouraged by the Watchtower Organization.<br>  <br>  The Jehovah's Witnesses consider themselves to be Christians because they believe they are serving the true and living God. Like many cults, they think they are the only true church on earth. Yet, they deny the Trinity, the deity of Christ, the personhood of the Holy Spirit, Jesus' physical resurrection, and salvation by grace through faith.<br>  <br>  The Jehovah's Witnesses are discouraged from looking into Jehovah's Witness history or old Watchtower literature which is replete with contradictions, altered doctrines, and false prophecies. Instead, they are indoctrinated repeatedly against basic Christian doctrines (Trinity, deity of Christ, etc) and into the notion that they alone are the true servants of God and that all others are either in "Christendom" or simply unbelievers.<br>  <br>  Primarily, the Jehovah's Witness organization is a mind control organization that uses its people to pass out literature and send in "donations" to the headquarters in Brooklyn, New York.<br>  <br>  "Thus the Bible is an organizational book and belongs to the Christian congregation as an organization, not to individuals, regardless of how sincerely they may believe that they can interpret the Bible." The Watchtower, Oct. 1, 1967. p. 587.<br>  <br>  The Watchtower organization of the Jehovah's Witnesses is a non-Christian organization that uses its people to promulgate false doctrines, and collects "contributions" for distribution of a multitudinous amount of literature, and expand its grip into the lives of its members and their families.<br>  <br>  It is a non-Christian cult.<br>  <br>  God Bless!<br>  <br>  P.s.

They are globally united (not splintered off into different sects, divisions, or whatever) and each of their 100,000+ congregations teach the same thing the world over. <br>  <br>  They maintain the proper Christian stand as far as being neutral in political affairs and conflicts of the nations. They alone obediently follow Jesus' command from Matthew 28 to preach the good news of the kingdom and they do it over the entire world. They don't mingle their teachings and beliefs with false doctrines of men (i.e. trinity, hellfire, immortal soul).|`|bVHnNqzBaa	They are people just like you and I.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just because JW don't believe in the fire and brimstone hell that generic Christians use as THEIR "mind control," does not make them any less Christian.

I've never heard that and I hope I never do.|`|AA11569882	According to the bible when a person dies they simply sleep until judgement day, when everyone will rise up together to be judged.  So where on earth churches have got the idea of kids becoming angels and grandma's looking down from heaven - I don't know!|`|7oCpSkmxaa	I absolutely don't believe that. <br>  <br>  Logically speaking:  Why would a loving God take a person's child - that child may be the only one, or one of 2 or 3 - to make another angel when he's got myriads and myriads of angels in heaven already?<br>  <br>  Biblically speaking:  The Bible teaches that the hope of the dead is to be resurrected back to life on earth after Armageddon, not resurrection to heavenly life as a spirit.<br>  <br>  Clergy members of various religions do say that "God needed another angel" when children die.  I don't see anything comforting about it, and I can't fathom any logical reason why they do that, since it's honestly not a biblical teaching.|`|0l1ZairMaa	It is senseless and in no way comforting to tell such an ugly lie and paint such a hateful picture of God!<br>  <br>  Angels are NOT humans, they are spirit creatures created as such to accomplish Jehovah's will whatever that may be.

Like you said God does not need anymore angels and no one going to heaven will become an angel.(Revelation 20:4) And I saw thrones, and there were those who sat down on them, and power of judging was given them. Yes, I saw the souls of those executed with the ax for the witness they bore to Jesus and for speaking about God, and those who had worshiped neither the wild beast nor its image and who had not received the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand. And they came to life and ruled as kings with the Christ for a thousand years.<br>  <br>  They will serve as Kings and Judges nowhere in the Bible does it say that they will become an angel.(Revelation 5:11) And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, and the number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,<br>  <br>  That is over a million million angels .The truth is this (Hebrews 2:14) Therefore, since the “young children” are sharers of blood and flesh, he also similarly partook of the same things, that through his death he might bring to nothing the one having the means to cause death, that is, the Devil.The devil causes death he caused it in the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve and has been causing it ever since.Jesus sacrifice will give us back the life he took from us.(Romans 5:12) That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned—.(John 5:28-29) Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice 29?and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.<br>  <br>  In the end Jesus will destroy Satan forever.(Romans 16:20) For his part, the God who gives peace will crush Satan under YOUR feet shortly.

In fact, in the heavenly heirarchy, I believe we are superior, for whatever that's worth. <br>  <br>  God doesn't kill people. We live in a fallen world and as such we are all going to die.

Furthermore, God already created all of the angels He "needs".  Personally, though, I'd cut them some slack.  A funeral service is intended to comfort the bereaved, not present a lesson on theology.|`|Y5IUse1vaa	I think that this saying has been used to try and ease the pain that parents feel when their child has been taken from them.

At some point, folk need to think that they are helping in some way, maybe this is the best way that people imagine that they are easing the grieff...I agree that a decent God would not take something so precious away from us.

"Why would a loving God allow blah, blah, blah?" These thoughts are the result of bad theology, and when our bad theology doesn't  suffice in our time of need, we question God's love and His goodness.<br>  <br>  Proper theology necessitates that God is in control of all things ~ even the death of a child. As painful as that may be for those who have experienced it, they must trust God's decision as they look to Him for the strength to get through it.|`|5WIZowKOaa	The Bible says that only 144,000 (corulers with Christ) are going to heaven. They will rule over the great crowd here on earth. The Bible refers to the condition of the dead as "sleeping" and states that there is going to be a resurrection of the righteous and unrighteous during the 1000 yr reign. While Jesus was on earth, He performed 3 resurrections. This was to show what Gods Kingdom would accomplish on a larger scale after Armageddon when Gods original purpose for the earth is fully realized. Now you can see why the phrase you mention seems unfair. It is as it is not true. God is a God of love and doesn't and would never do such unjust things. The truth, Gods word, the Bible is really simple to understand. It was done in such a way that ALL people could easily understand it.

Tests for Witchcraft involved checking the body for the 'third nipple' which in reality was absolutely any abnormality that that person happened to have, a mole, a scar or anything. Pricking - if there was no pain then the victim was guilty. There didn't have to be proof other than what was in front of the witchfinder's eyes.<br>  <br>  What they wanted most of all was a confession and techniques used to get this were the above mentioned browbeating (ie shouting, mental abuse, verbal abuse etc) and sleep deprivation.<br>  <br>  Ducking the witch in the river, if she floated she was a witch and was then hanged (burning didn't happen as often as people think) if she sank and drowned then she was considered innocent.<br>  <br>  The prosecutions were very biased, there need be no more 'evidence' than a neighbour pointing the finger and alleging 'witch' and a mark found on the body. What the peasants said was taken at face value - however unlikey the story - and the 'trial' no more than a sham to make the killing 'legal'<br>  <br>  2) a Peasant could accuse his Master of being a Witch but it would be the foolish peasant who did. The feudal system was not the same as the slave system - a slave has one master and there are many masters. The Feudal system has one Lord of the Manor (and landowner) in the area and all the peasants in the area were totally beholden to him. He owned their houses, they had to farm his fields and maybe (for some women) work in the house in return. The Lords were in charge, if Witchcraft was alleged  then it would be the local Lord and the Magistrate and local Holy man (there is a name and I've forgotten it - sorry)  who would be doing the prosecuting (obviously neither would physically do the torture but would order it to be done, they would however be in charge in the 'courtroom') the only way that a Lord could successfully be convicted of Witchcraft was if he was already falling foul of the other Lords in the area and they were looking to get rid of  him by fair means or foul. The Feudal system was one thing but the Lords had a kind of system as well, there was a lot of politics - who supported who in the favour of the Monarchy and such, and it didn't pay for a Lord to fall into disfavour since there was a very real fear of being tried for Treason (a more likely accusation that witchcraft)<br>  <br>  3 - Absolutely no way. Never. The peasants were the lowest of the low, they could not legally own anything that wasn't actually for cooking or living. Not even a 'longdog' or hunting hound. They couldn't even go into certain areas on the Lord's land. Their houses (owned by the Lord of the Manor) had very little furniture, only the very bare necessities. They also were expected to know their place since punishment came down on them for things that we would call minor today. For instance 'looking' at a woman of breeding. Not touching their cap to someone in authority, LOOKING at someone in authority. There is no way that a Peasant would ever dare to accuse their Lord of Witchcraft and even less of them getting the land.

f0JLp4hFaa	Why is the evolution/creation or religion/science argument important?  What does it matter what people believe?<br>  <br>  It's a fair question.  It really only matters when the two come into contradiction.  When a fundamentalist Christian teaches children that Genesis is a scientifically factual account of how the world was formed, then the conflict arises. <br>  <br>  <br>  Why does it matter if a rock is 6,000 years old, or 300,000,000 years old?  It's still a rock.<br>  <br>  It is incredibly important because it is about how we know what we know.  Humans have this amazing gift of intellect that allows them to question themselves and the world around them, and to change their behavior or their environment.  This ability has made us phenomenally adaptable and the most successful species on the planet (if you don't count bacteria as a single species).  <br>  <br>  How do you know not to touch the hot cookpot without wearing an oven mitt?  <br>  1)  authority (your mother) tells you not to; and<br>  2)  it is supported by logic and evidence (you or someone you know has been burned).<br>  <br>  How do you know not to take the first price the used car salesman gives you for the 1998 Taurus?<br>  1)  authority (your father tells you never take the first offer); and<br>  2)  you research, gather evidence from multiple sources, and realize that $30,000 for a 1998 Taurus is too much.<br>  <br>  How do we know bacteria causes many ulcers?<br>  1)  NOT from authority - when the theory first came out, everyone thought stress caused ulcers;<br>  2)  following the evidence, two doctors determined that bacteria was a cause;<br>  3)  they did experiments, explained their findings, published papers;<br>  4)  other people repeated their experiments, got the same answers; and<br>  5)  the opinion of the authorities changed - the scientific community and the world accepted that bacteria can cause ulcers.<br>  <br>  Through this method, of asking questions, seeking answers in systematic ways that reduce the chances that we'll be fooled, either by our own biases or by others, we have progressed human understanding in so many fields.  From the spring of the keys in your keyboard to the fact that your children need never fear smallpox to the fact that women can vote, the steady advance of technology and society has been based on knowledge by constantly questioning our current assumptions and by drawing rational conclusions from the available evidence.<br>  <br>  How do we know the rock is 300,000,000 years old?<br>  1)  geologists tell us it is;<br>  2)  they show us multiple lines of supporting evidence including sedimentary studies, radiometric dating, fossil inclusion, etc.;<br>  3)  other geologists, who are professionally competitive and skeptical, agree with the evidence; and<br>  4)  each of us has the ability to learn the science and the evidence in detail if we wish.<br>  <br>  Why do some think the rock is only 6000 years old?<br>  1)  Authority - Archbishop Ussher and others have interpreted scripture to tell us Biblical Creation happened ~6000 years ago;<br>  <br>  That's it.  End of argument.  To question this is to doubt the Word of God.  To accept this belief, we must surrender to authority, with no chance of appeal, no chance of change.  Regardless of what the evidence tells us, we must just give in to this authority and hold back any questions, suppress any doubts, and ignore any evidence to the contrary.  Creationist geologist Kurt Wise puts it very clearly: "As I shared with my professors years ago when I was in college, if all the evidence in the universe turned against creationism, I would be the first to admit it, but I would still be a creationist because that is what the Word of God seems to indicate.  Here I must stand."   As Professor Wise says, the dogma of creationism forces him to put aside all his training and all the evidence, and deny the very intellect that sets humans apart from all other species.  How does this improve human understanding of anything?<br>  <br>  This kind of thinking is dangerous.  It hurts us economically, because scientific advancement is the greatest engine for prosperity there is.  And it hurts us socially, because improved social understanding between people can ONLY come through the questioning of bias, of tradition, of stereotypes and through embracing our similarities and our differences.<br>  <br>  Look at a similar example:<br>  <br>  Why must women wear burqa?<br>  1)  Authority - Fundamentalist interpretation of Purdah tradition<br>  <br>  Do the facts support the social benefits of the burqa?  We can't even ask that question - it doesn't matter, because the authority is unquestionable, just like Biblical inerrancy or papal infallibility.  <br>  <br>  When you allow a person or institution to declare itself beyond question and without error, you've created a form of monarchy, exactly what the United States was designed to avoid.  When you are forced to ignore the evidence, to deny logic, to be blind to things that are demonstrably true, you've surrendered your greatest gift - your intellect.<br>  <br>  So the age of the rock, the validity of evolution, the age, size and motion of the cosmos- all of these things are symbols of the battle over the meaning of truth, the use or denial of intellect, and the freedom to ask questions.  And what makes it even more important is that the battle is not being fought between leading thinkers in each field, it is being fought with and around our children, in public school boardrooms and classes.  It is being fought not with reason and rationality and logic, but with public relations and lawyers.<br>  <br>  If you surrender your intellect to the PR put out by organizations like Answers in Genesis, you are buying into the PR, into the hype.  You're essentially taking the used car salesman's first offer.<br>  <br>  Some of you may not think this is important.  Some may not even be bothered to read this.  But our collective intellect is the only resource capable of getting this world beyond its current problems, capable of reducing suffering, capable of navigating a safe, prosperous and healthy future from among the many unpleasant possibilities.  So yes, I think the topic of how we use that intellect is just about the most important thing we can discuss.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	I have no problem with science, hated it at school though lol CHEMISTRY eughh!|`|houWY7qvaa	Atheists and Christians are not hand in hand like religion and science and that is for the simple reason that they have opposing views of how humans were created.  No one that I know of cares if an atheist chooses not to believe, but they do care if an atheist sees fit to change a Christian.   I take some of what I said back, Some Christians believe that it is their duty to conform an atheist and some atheists believe it is their dire duty to make a mockery out of religion.  This is old and has been rehashed so many times that I am wondering why it is even allowed to be asked any more.   Science and Atheism does not go hand in hand either.  Just because one does not believe in God, does not mean that they believe in Science either.

Just like religions are not real. The bible etc, etc, and the Abrahemic faiths of judaism, christianity and islam are stories made up by males to assure their dominant roll in society as kleptocrates, using all the current agnotology possible (Ref. Jared Diamond's books) and Sam Harris' End of Faith. <br>  <br>  No, a man does not need a made up god to have courage, integrity, honesty, hope, love, respect, and most of all knowledge (epistology).<br>  Most men I have flown with are agnostic. Almost all of the PhD's I have done work with are agnostic and/or atheists. I think one's belief in a god-religion is inversely related to ones level of knowledge and higher education.

Instead I just live my own life, since you can't really control what people really think of you...That's not to say that if someone has some constructive criticism that I won't take their advice to heart, but I don't obsess about appearances.

However, Moral laws still apply to us today and even though ceremonial and civil laws don't apply there are still principles to be learned from them because they reveals the nature of how God is and what he wants and how he operates.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensatio...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.larkinestate.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.larkinestate.com/</a><br>  <br>  How to go to Heaven:<br>  <a href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/how_to_be_saved.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/how_to_be...</a><br>  <br>  God bless.|`|1c2adb2d5aad294a18068c79ec140867aa	Read all of the verses around it, it explains everything even the "unclean" part.

You can't put soap on a soul.  The "uncleanness" can only be washed away by time.  And "evening", sundown, simply designates the start of a new day.  So if it's already evening, then the unclean person has to wait until the following sundown.<br>  <br>  Because sex was required to make babies happen, it was considered a divine activity, under the control of God, so sex amounted to a sort of temporary, manageable blasphemy, a necessary evil.  The Christian attitude toward sex was more a disapproval of worldly, bodily pleasure, something to be avoided if at all possible. Since Jesus was expected back momentarily, this was not considered a problem for early Christians.  And Christianity never quite adapted when sex became a necessity again.  So, sex is still nasty, but there are several completely unrelated reasons why.|`|AA11008046	That was under Mosaic law.  It is a follow up to all kinds of discharge.

They were tested and tried a lot of them to try and deny their testimonies. A lot of those trials frankly were a bunch of low down dirty tricks.

He was at various times a Quaker, Baptist, Universalist, Restorationer, and Presbyterian. <br>   <br>  Mormon writers have acknowledged this instability:  “Martin Harris was an unaggressive, vacillating, easily influenced person.” (E. Cecil McGavin, The Historical Background for the Doctrine & Covenants, p. 23).<br>  <br>  LDS writer Richard Anderson wrote:  “The foregoing tendencies explain the spiritual wanderlust that afflicted the solitary witness at Kirtland.  In this period of his life he changed his religious position eight times,…Every affiliation of Martin Harris was with some Mormon group, except when he was affiliated with the Shaker belief,…” (Improvement Era, March 1969, pg 63)<br>  <br>  Martin joined the Shakers after leaving the Mormons. In a letter to Brigham Young, Mormon Phineas Young wrote:  “Martin Harris is a firm believer in Shakerism, says his testimony is greater than it was of the Book of Mormon” (Martin Harris – Witness and Benefactor to the Book of Mormon, Wayne C. Gunnell, BYU thesis, 1955, p. 52).  (The Shakers had their own book of scriptures supposedly given to Shaker founder Anna Lee by an angel; an event said to have been witnessed by over 500 people.)  Martin, when asked if he had actually seen the plates, responded that he saw the BOM plates with his “spiritual” eye.<br>  It is very interesting to note that in a revelation given in July of 1828, Martin Harris is called a “wicked man”:  “And when thou deliverest up that which God had given thee sight and power to translate, thou deliverest up that which was sacred into the hand of a wicked man.” (D&C, Sec. 3, verse 12)<br>  <br>  In another revelation given sometime later, Martin Harris is again called a wicked man:  “And for this cause I said that he is a wicked man, for he has sought to take away the things wherewith you have been entrusted; and he has also sought to destroy your gift.”  (D&C, Sec. 10, verse 6-7)<br>  <br>  The Mormons stated of Martin Harris, and a few other men within the pages of the church's official newspaper at the time, "a lying deceptive spirit attend them ... they are of their father, the devil ... The very countenance of Harris will show to every spiritual-minded person who sees him, that the wrath of God is upon him." [Latter-Day Saint's, Millennial Star, Vol 8 pp 124-128.]<br>  <br>  It is also very significant that Joseph Smith himself called into question the moral integrity of at least five of the eleven witnesses.  He wrote:  “Such characters as McLellin, John Whitmer, David Whitmer, Oliver Cowdery and Martin Harris, are too mean to mention; and we had liked to have forgotten them.”  (History of the Church, vol. 3, p. 232).  These men were later accused of being “united with a gang of counterfeiters, thieves, liars and blacklegs of the deepest dye, to deceive and defraud.” (Senate Document 189, 1841, p. 9).<br>  <br>  By 1847 not a single one of the surviving eleven witnesses (except those related to Joseph Smith) was part of the Mormon church.  Five of these witnesses joined The Church of Christ started by William McLellin; Oliver Cowdery indicated he was supportive of this group though he never joined (BYU Professor D. Michael Quinn, The Mormon Hierarchy, 1994, p. 188).  If these men were alive today, the LDS church would label them apostates.  They would be cut off from the LDS church and condemned to outer darkness, regardless of whether or not they still believed in the Book of Mormon.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	If I were trying to start up a new religion, Harris is exactly the kind of gullible fool I'd target.<br>  <br>  What do you think of his wife Lucy, who knew him best?

I know the book of mormon is historically true especially of the native americans. I believe Lehi & his wife&family left Jeruselum before it got destroyed 600 yrs before Jesus arrived. God said he put people on all parts of the earth. Does this mean he placed them there & quit communicating with them? No!   <br>  I am an LDS member & I do not believe in the book of mormon just because I am part of the church. Before I was baptized with the chur h this past december I atteneded off/on for 6 yrs  besides my baptist church before deciding to finally give up the baptist church & go to this one. What I like biblically about this church is they followed through what the disciples did in the book of Acts where other main stream churches fail to do after baptisim, which is the confirmation/ laying on hands, it is biblical. Also the LDS are not the ONLY  church/orginization that does this, many sabbath (saturday) churches of the church of God does so as well.<br>  Bless the witnesses/disciples of Jesus Christ who saw his ministry & his resurection & still believed carrying on his work, Godbless the latter day Joseph Smith carrying out Gods will & the witnesses seeing the angels.

Nevertheless, at least during the early years, Harris "seems to have repeatedly admitted the internal, subjective nature of his visionary experience."[22] The foreman in the Palmyra printing office that produced the first Book of Mormon said that Harris "used to practice a good deal of his characteristic jargon and 'seeing with the spiritual eye,' and the like." [23] John H. Gilbert, the typesetter for most of the book, said that he had asked Harris, "Martin, did you see those plates with your naked eyes?" According to Gilbert, Harris "looked down for an instant, raised his eyes up, and said, 'No, I saw them with a spiritual eye."[24] Two other Palmyra residents said that Harris told them that he had seen the plates with "the eye of faith" or "spiritual eyes." [25] In 1838, Harris is said to have told an Ohio congregation that "he never saw the plates with his natural eyes, only in vision or imagination."[26]A neighbor of Harris in Kirtland, Ohio, said that Harris "never claimed to have seen [the plates] with his natural eyes, only spiritual vision." [27]<br>  In March 1838, disillusioned church members said that Harris had publicly denied that neither he nor the other Witnesses to the Book of Mormon had ever seen or handled the golden plates—although he had not been present when Whitmer and Cowdery first claimed to have viewed them—and they claimed that Harris's recantation, made during a period of crisis in early Mormonism, induced five influential members, including three Apostles, to leave the Church.[28] Even at the end of his long life, Harris said that he had seen the plates in "a state of entrancement."[29] Nevertheless, in 1853, Harris told one David Dille that he had held the forty- to sixty-pound plates on his knee for "an hour-and-a-half" and handled the plates with his hands, "plate after plate."[30] Even later, Harris affirmed that he had seen the plates and the angel with his natural eyes: "Gentlemen," holding out his hand, "do you see that hand? Are you sure you see it? Or are your eyes playing you a trick or something? No. Well, as sure as you see my hand so sure did I see the Angel and the plates." [31] The following year Harris affirmed that "No man heard me in any way deny the truth of the Book of Mormon [or] the administration of the angel that showed me the plates."[32]"

pOTigVYPaa	The similarities are the global violence that plagues mankind today and the fact that in the days of Noah, people took no note of what was happening around them and continued life as usual, marrying, and being given in marriage, eating and drinking. (Matthew 24:37-39). 2 Peter 2:5 describes Noah not only as the builder of the Ark but also calls him a "preacher of righteousness."  So not only did Noah's contemporaries ignore the violence around them, but they also ignored the warning of the coming destruction that Noah preached to them as well.  The same will occur in this "time of the end."  People in general will downplay the violence and will also ignore the warning being given.|`|AA11188574	Noah was given a job to do because God has seen the world as something detestable and in need of a total cleansing. The wickedness was great and need to end. Noah followed the instructions built the ark and saved his life along with his family. He told the people that God was about to take action but no one took him seriously. It is just like today. God is about to bring an end to this wicked world. God has given His people the job of telling people what will happen but most do not take it seriously. Most people are not doing bad things but are just going about the normal things of the day.getting married, shopping, eating, drinking which is not bad. The problem is that most are not listening to the warning. Just like those in Noah's day had to get into the Ark in order to be saved again today God has given us the responsibility to find out what He wants us to do by studying the bible but most think that is silly, just as they thought it was silly that Noah was building this large ship UNTIL it started to rain. Do not wait, read your bible and see how God will preserve you and what you have to do to be saved like Noah and his family.|`|mrMkKFqNaa	Not too many.<br>  <br>  Let's see, are there any demons walking around in human bodies, having relations with human women, creating a hybrid race of Nephilim?

So, the story is in reality a myth based on a myth.  Jesus likewise was a mythcial character with no historical support for his existance.  So you are concerned about what one myth said about the other.  Kind of like being worried what Harry Potter had to say about Valdamont|`|xzkp7Pklaa	Jesus made this comparison because just like in Noah's day, people today are much too concerned with their personal lives and desires to appreciate spiritual things or to discern the URGENCY of the time period in which we live.  Noah and his relatively small family build a HUGE, GIGANTIC, ENORMOUS Arc from the bottom up with the conveniences of a Home Depot or Lowe's, and yet, its so interesting to me that nobody thought, "Wow, How in the world are they able to accomplish all of that by themselves?!  They must have God's supports...Maybe I should listen to what Noah is saying, because apparently something is motivating him and his family to be so different and accomplish so much."  But no one did this, at least not to an extent sufficient enough to motivate them to change, because ONLY Noah and his family survived.  Instead, people were too consumed with thier own lives and interest to be concerned with God, 'eating, drinking, marrying', and furthermore they mocked Noah for proclaiming his message.  Likewise today, people are doing the EXACT same thing.  Jehovah's Witnesses have carried out a preaching work that is 'Arc like' in its size and greatness, and yet most people never think of How Jehovah's Witnesses have carried out more preaching work than any other religion, even though they are one of the smallest Christian denominations.  Jehovah's Witnesses are carrying out Jesus command to preach and make disciples (Matt. 28:19,20) But who else is??  Instead people mock Jehovah's Witnesses and even try to hinder their work.  But just like Noah, Jehovah will protect and direct our work, because it is Jehovah's will that such a work be carried out.

I mean, if someone were to run across anyone (white, asian, black, etc) in the bad part of town, they are definitely not going to trust them, and probably switch to the other sidewalk. And unfortunately, blacks and many other minorities have always had a hard time making it in society, so they live in or close to the bad part of town.

9jxFpFTJaa	Well, some stories have survived thousands of years, from being passed down form generation to generation, carefully preserved and transcribed for the benefit of future peoples, like the Bible, and it's stories (whether you regard most of it as literal or figurative). <br>  <br>  Things like what you saw are best guesses about the history of mankind and how societies developed based on things like artifacts and fossils and bones which are dug up. Ultimately, it is unverifiable what life was like 10,000 years ago - at least, we can not accurately know. But archaeologists find artifacts which apparently they can date as existing between "this year and that year" and then make deductions about what life was like then. <br>  <br>  However, there are a lot of flaws in the methods they use for dating fossils, so it's hard to say even when some of these artifacts and fossils really existed. <br>  <br>  Here's a site which gives a brief overview of Carbon Dating - the most popular method for dating artifacts and remains. Hope this helps|`|zEoRcL91aa	Old artifacts show up embedded into rocks under the ground. Sometimes these artifacts gets churned up by farm ploughs and discovered. If you have an interest in those times here is a link for prehistoric temples on Malta:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://web.infinito.it/utenti/m/malta_mega_temples/" rel="nofollow">http://web.infinito.it/utenti/m/malta_me...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/malta/malta.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/malta...</a>|`|1IVEYMA9aa	Basically a bunch of people got together about 40 years ago and wrote our worlds history.

Usually we can look at tools, paintings(cave paintings), and other items from circa 10,000 years ago.  We cannot be certain, but we can give a logical guess.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	We don't.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Archeaology is the study of those ancient civilizations and by studying the artifacts left by those civilizations, we can formulate a reasonable hypothesis of what things were like...its a guess, yes, but it is a very educated guess.|`|RuOTJLyvaa	we have no idea exactly what happened 1000 years ago. History is sketchy at best, since no one is alive to remember it.|`|htQrkD8waa	most likely a combination of written records, the finding of artifacts and dating them-|`|bc1cdc0543b28607a5324cf5017d42daaa	We don't. I don't believe what they tell us but I feel that we just have to go by what they tell us.

Either way, people never realize they are wasting someone's time because to them, whatever they are doing seems important.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no..
AA12194228	That is an excellent question. There are many things Christians do that certainly belie their claim to be christian.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	They don't have to justify going to church.  The church is full of sinners, that I can guarantee you.|`|ZNRYqss9aa	They believe they are right and that God tell them to.|`|AA11058044	It's a religion built by misogynistic, wife-beating neolithic goat herders.  The Bible condones wife beating in several places, not to mention other abuses and atrocities towards women.<br>  <br>  I'm pleasantly surprised when a Christian man isn't a wife-beating thug.  It certainly isn't due to their religious upbringing.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	i think you mean how do they justify abusing their spouses?? church is fine but they arent learning anything...we cant know their thoughts..|`|CnqGu1Taaa	good question............a beater is a beater regardless of the Tag you place on them|`|o4UrRbTvaa	It's disgusting, but abusers have used the Bible to justify the beating of their wives for thousands of years, and many countries still do.  Look at the last line.  <br>  <br>  Genesis 3:16  To the woman He said, "I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; with pain you will give birth to children.  Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."<br>  <br>  Besides there are numerous verses where it states that the wives were just pieces of property (like slaves) and the husband has every right to beat or even kill them for their transgressions.  According to scholars, the status of women in the church was so degraded during the Middle Ages that men were exhorted from the pulpit to beat their wives and wives to kiss the rod that beat them. So, the curse God placed on all women after Adam & Eve's fall is the earliest example of the negative definition of women which makes them legitimate targets of antagonism.<br>  <br>  It's sickening.|`|zQyslfHKaa	Religion is not based on ration, so if a person has the ability to ignor all scientific information, and rely on faith, they are quite capable of doing incredibly immoral things and rely on faith in self to absolve them.<br>  <br>  Basically dishonesty with fact, allows for dishonesty with action.<br>  <br>  I saw it first hand, working for a mormon who was one of the top 70 counsel members in the LDS religion.  He was a very pious man who started every day with a group prayer in the office.  He called me the Heathen, because I was the only non mormon in the Utah office, he was joking and it didn't bother me.<br>  <br>  However, when one of our employees wives got Lukemia, he asked me to fire him, because her illness was driving up our insurance rates.  I was flawed, because up until then I viewed him as an honest man.  I refused of course, and told him I couldn't morally do it, and he tried to explain that the guy and his wife weren't under his mantle because they weren't mormons.  It was incredible and gave me an insight into religious belief, that I had never understood before.<br>  <br>  He completely believed he was doing a moral thing, even though it would have resulted in a horrific outcome for another human family.  In the end he did it anyway, and I quit.|`|AA10153636	They are fooling themselves..<br>  I had this argument with 2 (Christian) men that said there was a time when husbands should beat their wives to stop them from leaving.   <br>  They never did come around.   <br>  The Bible says "Husbands should love their wives as their own bodies"   Never saw a man that wanted to get beat up and when they did the beating didn't change their mind..  <br>  <br>  I know that some people do, but the wives need to tell the Pastor of the church and arrange to get out.   Beating or hitting on either side is not an option.   If you are that angry, then walk away and go for a walk or kick a post.|`|ij5Sv6staa	They are the ones who need to go to church...<br>  <br>  <br>  Matthew 9:12-14 <br>   12On hearing this, Jesus said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. 13But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	You know of this personally? I know you don't as your just wanting to sound so smart. And lastly if we were all perfect we would have no need for a Church or Savior.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	A man who beats his wife is not Christian, no matter how hard he tried to convince anyone of it.|`|a63qA8wzaa	OH MY GOD!!<br>  most the time the woman instigates it<br>  where do you come off judging others|`|SAceGS46aa	Religion doesn't = a good person.|`|dIA3GosTaa	Well, to be quite honest, men should not touch their wives in any manner that would hurt them. It is not Biblical and it most certainly is not moral. If you have a friend who is being beaten by a husband who goes to church then he is most likely trying to even things out. He probably has the mindset "if I do something bad, then going to church will make it okay." This is totally wrong. In the Bible it says that husbands should honor their wives and wives their husbands. That is about it and if you are being beaten by your husband and he still goes to church, encourage him to keep going to church but tell him that it does not justify the fact that he beats you.|`|k6x2lVLYaa	Those people who beat their wives are not true beleivers, And people who sin then don't repent and continue, are only going to church because they most likely want to have a 'good ego' about themselves and try to come off as holy men.<br>  <br>  <br>  =\<br>  <br>  I think religion is dumb, I beleive in god/creator with all my heart, but to me this is a spiritual thing, I try to obey the bible, etc. but I can not spend something like this, where I have to spend my entire day on.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  x|`|ehqLev79aa	How could he justify being a Man or a Good Person at all?<br>  <br>  If you or someone you know is having this problem you have a moral and legal obligation to do something about it.<br>  <br>  I hope that this was simply a hypothetical and you're really not in any harm.<br>  <br>  - GladToHelp|`|VxrsfAfyaa	I guess the same way atheists justify molesting their children.  I hope you are smart enough to see how ridiculous both of these statements sound.|`|EJMwqU3caa	I'm not justifiying that beating anyone is ok by any means, but we are ALL sinners, some just choose to sin in more serious ways.  Trust me - this man will get his judgement from the Lord.|`|vtafeEIJaa	Satan the Great....

0yTM98Odaa	Me too!  It's so ridiculous!  It's a very twisted concept and I don't understand how Christians actually say it is just and fair.  Also hell comes from paganism.<br>  <br>  And what is with people saying oh so and so saw it so it must be true!  Well what about all those people who have had near death experiences but saw nothing like a hell and saw a Heaven type place where all kinds of people went.  What about those who have had near death experiences and were told all religions are valid to God and all come from God!  Why don't they consider them, oh yeah because it ruins their hell concept!<br>  <br>  DARE- you can believe in God and not a hell, it's only really Christianity and Islam that have the concept of hell.  Some people believe in God but don't believe in afterlife.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Well, you are wrong.

It stopped me from making an off-the-cuff comment that wouldn't have helped.<br>  <br>  Accepting God's will on faith is often very difficult, especially for Christians who are above-average in IQ or some other measure of mental ability.  That is, the thinking person has to KNOW something - rather than just accept it on faith.  <br>  <br>  I've struggled with it for years, and for me, it comes down to a matter of limitations.<br>  <br>  Even if I think I'm the smartest guy in the world - I have my limits.  God doesn't.  There are some things that happen in this world that I can never understand.  God understands everything.  <br>  <br>  When we begin to understand our own limits, and God's limitlessness, we are close to learning to trust Him - instead of relying on ourselves.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the simplest way to put this - when you're struggling with something in your heart, and in your mind - is to force yourself to <br>  <br>  "Let go, and let God".<br>  <br>  It's hard to do - but it's never failed me.|`|n5DlXdsCaa	Every Christian goes through that some time or another - most go through it multiple times.

I am very open sexually and believe that two people in a relationship need to be on similar planes.  For instance, it would not do for my wife to be opposed to oral sex or some other variances.  She is not so we are really fully compatible, but if she had been, it would have been better to know before we married.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can comprimise, if you choose to with some forplay, etc, but if you are opposed and he is not then you may not be right for each other.  You are not wrong and neither is he, but hold different views. Now is the time to find out.  If you do not want sex before marriage, make it clear and if he is willing to wait, fine, but if he is not, that doesn't make him bad, it just means you both need to move on to another companion.|`|2Mug8KaBaa	You need to make it VERY clear what you want and expect from the relationship with regards to sex.

At the time that He was doing this, Saul of Tarsus was persecuting the Judaist sect that would one day become Christianity.  Paul - as Saul would later be known - was not named by Christ as an apostle.  Why his letters are identified as the "Epistles of Paul the Apostle" is beyond me.<br>  Now, if you want to call Paul a disciple and someone who gave everything of himself to spread the gospel, then I can understand where you're coming from.  I don't consider him to be an apostle, but I don't consider his contribution to the early faith to be "false" either.

jBYxEX8taa	To the first answerer; The Quran was written hundreds of years after the Bible.<br>  <br>  What I don't understand about the Muslim religion though, is that they define Jesus as merely a prophet, and not the Son of God. Yet, they refuse to accept what He said when He said He is the Son of God. So I'm just wondering if according to them, prophets are liars? Since Jesus claimed He is the Son of God. Rejecting that bit and accepting another seems odd. And if any Muslim could give me some insight to this I'd really appreciate it.|`|AA12203324	Your quote from 1 John specifies a prophetic test: that they acknowledge that Jesus Christ came "in the flesh".

The Lord your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul. It is the Lord your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him. That prophet or dreamer must be put to death, because he preached rebellion against the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; he has tried to turn you from the way the Lord your God commanded you to follow.

It still works today! The Christian idea that this whimsical God always listens to them is wishful hoping that the chances are just right that God will answer on the spot, or later on, or never! It is just like praying to a stick or a rock or any other more benevolent Heathen God and getting the SAME IDENTICAL RESULT!<br>  <br>  Romans 9:11-15  Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad–in order that God's purpose in election might stand: not by works but by him who calls–she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” Just as it is written: “Jacob* (*Israel) I loved, but Esau* (*Arabs) I hated.”  What then shall we say? IS GOD UNJUST? NOT AT ALL!* (*Saint Paul says so… because he is telling you he speaks for God!)  For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”* (*the Christian clergy preaches you all the opposite that God is “no respecter of persons” when the Bible writers made it clear that he very picky just for the heck of it! BTW, one of the reasons why Christians do not favor Palestinians at all unless they convert to Christianity is in this Bible story that is taught in Sunday School session not over the public media!  If the Palestinians convert to Christianity there is no guessing of what will happen. Christians favor for Israel will be put on hold! Except for Christians in America most Christians elsewhere don’t give a hoot about politics!) <br>  <br>   Malachi 1:4  (NIV) Edom* (*Esau = Arabs) may say, "Though we have been crushed, we will rebuild the ruins."  But this is what the LORD Almighty says: "They may build, but I will demolish. They will be called the Wicked Land, A PEOPLE ALWAYS UNDER THE WRATH OF THE LORD* (*How would you like to be one of them? No FREE WILL FOR YOU! NO Salvation, either! God doesn’t like you for ever just for the heck of it! AND GOD NEVER CHANGES!)<br>  <br>  Isaiah 45:7 (infallible King James Version) I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and CREATE EVIL: I the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, but God) do all these things.<br>  <br>  Job 42:11 (infallible King James Version) Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over ALL THE EVIL that the LORD* (*NOT SATAN, BUT GOD!) had brought upon him:* (*God had a plan to have ALL of Job’s children slaughtered, too! The heck with family love and affection…!!! Isn’t God so wonderful?! Life is so cheap in the Bible and Christians are forcing this kinda God on everybody!)<br>  <br>  When was the last time that a Christian credited God for any of his/her misfortune?

His list maintains the Septuagint order of books but contains only the Old Testament protocanonicals minus the Book of Esther. <br>    <br>  The Council of Laodicea, c. 360, produced a list of books similar to today's canon. This was one of the Church's earliest decisions on a canon. <br>    <br>  Pope Damasus, 366-384, in his Decree, listed the books of today's canon. <br>    <br>  The Council of Rome, 382, was the forum which prompted Pope Damasus' Decree. <br>    <br>  Bishop Exuperius of Toulouse wrote to Pope Innocent I in 405 requesting a list of canonical books. Pope Innocent listed the present canon. <br>    <br>  The Council of Hippo, a local north Africa council of bishops created the list of the Old and New Testament books in 393 which is the same as the Roman Catholic list today. <br>    <br>  The Council of Carthage, a local north Africa council of bishops created the same list of canonical books in 397. This is the council which many Protestant and Evangelical Christians take as the authority for the New Testament canon of books. The Old Testament canon from the same council is identical to Roman Catholic canon today. Another Council of Carthage in 419 offered the same list of canonical books. <br>    <br>  Since the Roman Catholic Church does not define truths unless errors abound on the matter, Roman Catholic Christians look to the Council of Florence, an ecumenical council in 1441 for the first definitive list of canonical books. <br>    <br>  The final infallible definition of canonical books for Roman Catholic Christians came from the Council of Trent in 1556 in the face of the errors of the Reformers who rejected seven Old Testament books from the canon of scripture to that time. <br>  There was no canon of scripture in the early Church; there was no Bible. The Bible is the book of the Church; she is not the Church of the Bible. It was the Church--her leadership, faithful people--guided by the authority of the Spirit of Truth which discovered the books inspired by God in their writing. The Church did not create the canon; she discerned the canon. Fixed canons of the Old and New Testaments, hence the Bible, were not known much before the end of the 2nd and early 3rd century.

He will be in touch with you soon"<br>  <br>  Avoiding them isn't really a good way to handle it.

AA11440601	The Catholic Church and many other Christians Churches follow the Biblical practice of Jesus Christ and the Jews in setting aside days where the entire Church fasts and prays as one in a attitude of constant renewal.<br>  <br>  By the solemn forty days of Lent the Church unites herself each year to the mystery of Jesus in the desert and in spiritual preparation for the celebration of His Passion, Death, and Resurrection.<br>  <br>  This season of penance is an intense moment of the Church's penitential practice and are particularly appropriate for spiritual exercises, penitential liturgies, pilgrimages as signs of penance, voluntary self-denial such as fasting and almsgiving, and charitable and missionary works.<br>  <br>  The Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches also observe the season of Lent. Many modern Protestant Churches consider the observation of Lent to be a choice, rather than an obligation.<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 1438:<br>  <a href="http://www.nccbuscc.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt2.shtml#1438" rel="nofollow">http://www.nccbuscc.org/catechism/text/p...</a><br>  <br>  For Lenten resources, see: <br>  ? <a href="http://www.usccb.org/lent/" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/lent/</a><br>  ? <a href="http://americancatholic.org/Features/Lent/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://americancatholic.org/Features/Len...</a><br>  ? <a href="http://americancatholic.org/Newsletters/CU/ac0205.asp" rel="nofollow">http://americancatholic.org/Newsletters/...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	It's a religious thing and lots of religions practice lent but only Catholics take it the most serious.|`|AA12203324	It's a religion thing, based on the general Bible idea that one needs arduous preparation (sometimes called a "desert experience") for spiritual progress.  Like Israel in the Sinai desert, or Judah in exile in Babylon, the ordeal of Jesus in the wilderness is used as the model for Lent. There are also a number of prophetic references to this type of spiritual cleansing, such as in Hosea and Ezekiel.<br>  <br>  Catholic and Orthodox churches have had some form of Lent since the practice was begun in the Middle Ages.  Some of the mainline Protestant churches have adopted it (Anglican, Lutheran, etc.), mainly because it focuses on personal reform rather than ecclesiastical intervention, but there is no hierarchical authority to impose it, so it is often up to individual congregations whether it is observed or not.|`|jard50Yiaa	Lent, in Christian tradition, is the period of the liturgical year leading up to Easter. Conventionally it is described as being forty days long, though different denominations calculate the forty days differently. In many denominations it is observed as a period of fasting and prayer, and this practice was virtually universal in Christendom until the Protestant Reformation. The forty days represent the time that, according to the Bible, Jesus spent in the desert before the beginning of his public ministry, where he endured temptation by Satan.<br>  <br>  The traditional purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer — through prayer, penitence, almsgiving and self-denial — for the annual commemoration during Holy Week of the Death and Resurrection of Jesus, which recalls the events linked to the Passion of Christ and culminates in Easter, the celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Just Christians, but every religion observes some sort of fasting period.

Further, researchers are working on and having a great deal of success in developing methods to harvest embryonic stem cells that do not harm the foetus.<br>  <br>  Military spending serves many political and economic and even sociological goods.  That it is not always used wisely does not void its benefits.<br>  <br>  Partial Birth Abortions are *NEVER* necessary for the well being of the mother.  A slip of the doctor's hand and the head is out, and the child is BORN instead of murdered.|`|Xcri5qeTaa	He didn't vote for partial-birth abortions. In fact, he's always voted against them.

I am sorry your religion convinces you that killing people in the present is more important than saving them in the future.<br>  <br>  Your faith causes you to describe horrific things that rarely happen in order to make a point about your hope for more horrific things.

It does NOT allow for partial birth abortions, nor does it overturn a previously established ban on it.<br>  <br>  EDIT--Reread what you wrote to me then get back to me about not demonizing anyone.  People aren't doing what YOU think they ought to do, so they are under demonic influence.  People aren't doing what YOU think they ought to do, so their reasoning is skewed.  You can't demonize someone any more than you do when you say they are under demonic influence. You demonize someone when you compare them to Hitler.  While we're on the subject of Hitler, you don't compare someone to Hitler unless you're doing it for shock value; you don't do it unless you're trying to stir up hate against the person you're comparing to Hitler.  So, you're not being honest when you deny demonizing anyone. <br>  <br>  Further: The rest of what you said to me only in my mind backs up what I said to you.  No one is giving partial birth abortions, and no one wants partial birth abortions. Read FOCA before you criticize it or anyone else.|`|hiCSVwchaa	I am so damn sick of people lying about stem cell research and abortion. <br>  <br>  First, the embryos used for stem cell research exist already, and will never be implanted in women.  They are the frozen embryos left over from fertility treatments, and if they aren't used for research, they will literally be thrown out.<br>  <br>  Second, hardly anybody ever has a partial birth abortion.  The only reason to have one is if the mother's life is in danger.  It is not used as any sort of birth control.  And the medical term is late term abortion.  "Partial birth abortion" is a term literally created by the religious right. <br>  <br>  Both of these things can be seen as making Americans safer, as the first will lead to cures for diseases, and the second will keep women from dying in childbirth.
AA11432517	Both. Any decision you make now will have no effect on the past, it will effect the future. However, you will have no basis on which to make a decision unless you consider what has already happened. You learn things as you go along in life which become things in your past, your memory, and your brain utilizes these things to conduct any kind of thinking, whether it be about the past or about the future. So both past and future are involved in decision-making.|`|oTwymgpIaa	That is a difficult question, sometimes we spend so much time determining the outcome of our actions we never act and thus forget to live. There can always be negative or positive results to any event or action, history doesn't always repeat itself and your future outcome could be much different than another persons when choosing the same coarse of actions. You should always consider the outcome based upon past and future, but never allow these things to alter your choices to such a degree that you take no action at all. ;-)|`|N8wNmQShaa	Well, sometimes the past is good when trying to make decisions that will effect the Future, however... the Future hasn't happend yet so it just depends.<br>  <br>  On certain things, such as... purchasing an item from the same place, if we know it was good in the past... it would effect our future decision and we most likely know we will be getting a good product.<br>  <br>  If we purchased something bad from a certain place, we most likely wont go back, so in a sense... it does effect our future.<br>  <br>  But... as far as "seeing the future" we cannot do that through the past. But people do say, History repeats itself.|`|G9xUwEopaa	Depends but I'd say more so the future. Unless a friend screwed you once pretty bad and your thinking about defending them. Look to the past how they screwed you.|`|Ex3XC0ayaa	It's never a good idea to step back into your past because you'll end up in the most cases in the same day to day cycle of life.When making long term decisions you should really look to your future and feel great about your whats a head of you...But that's just my opinion..:0)|`|pDd5jRxEaa	WELL ...logically speaking the future has yet to happen so .......... how can you make a decision based on an event that has not happened??<br>  <br>  Now if you are projecting future repercussions to your decision then you need to really think it long and hard ...deicions made on the spur of the moment tend to come back and bit the gluttus maximus!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Think!|`|9TeE1K3Eaa	Yes, they need to think how will my decision affect my future.  Also look to the past since we are doomed to repeat history.|`|dQcPV4Rqaa	WELL I GUESS SINCE THE FUTURE HASN'T HAPPENED YET, YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY MAKE ANY DECISONS ON THE FUTURE...HOW WOULD ON DO THAT??<br>  <br>  SO IT WOULD BE WISE TO LOOK TO THE PAST...SUPPOSEDLY THAT IS HOW WE LEARN..BY LOOKING AT THE MISTAKES MADE AND LEARNING FROM THEM..THE  HUMAN TENDENCY IS UNFORTUNATELY TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES OVER AND OVER... ISN'T THAT SAD?<br>  <br>  I THINK THAT OUR GOVERNMENT SHOULD FOLLOW THIS ADVICE TOO...IT MIGHT HAVE SAVED US A LOT OF GRIEF AND THE DOWNFALL OF OUR WHOLE ECONOMIC SYSTEM...|`|8f23a4206101dec944da03ad28d56bc5aa	They need to look to the future with an eye on the past.  Why?  Because the past teaches things that can affect the future.

No politicians will ever have the best interest of the people.    If Obama really wanted to make a change and tax the rich more, then why did he not lead by example?   Why don't he and his staff start paying for their own health insurance and gas etc etc etc.      True colors always surface.  He is the same as the rest, talks a good game to get the votes then ends up being the same as the rest.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	You mean like Bush did? Especially when he had the "revelation" from God to go to war in Iraq? Anything to fool the masses huh?<br>  <br>  I think I see what you mean, but there are many who claim to be religious, but really, what is being religious? -- and what set of standards are these so-called religious apes following?? Their own brand or truthful Bible standards from God's word, the Bible? Do they pray for guidance from God often, or do they just tell us [as in Bush] that they do, and get quirky revelations to go and commit mass murder in foreign nations?<br>  <br>  Obama, though he won't be able to undo all the damages set in place by his predecessors, he is at least trying to end this bloodshed, murderous, built-on-hoax of a war, eh? Obama is not perfect, but what president has? -- and they all have been of one race... what kind of evil is that??<br>  <br>  Before you speak, or post rather, think, think, think about what it is that you will be putting out for the public to see. It makes you look bad and uninformed, even critical and abusive and for what? Just because you don't like a first Black man being our president? <br>  <br>  Why didn't you point out all the misgivings including an unnecessary murderous war that Bush got us into. After Obama is trying to get us out. Pompous behind doughboy males have ruined quite a bit for our country and the damages are insurmountable, but all you can do is bash Obama who's barely been in office for a month.<br>  <br>  Can a politician be a true Christian at all anyway? I don't think so because what does Daniel 2:44 tell us about what Jesus will do at Armageddon to all these worldly governments and those mingling in them? They will be destroyed, crushed and a heavenly government will be put into place that will never be brought to ruin. Politicians are made up of imperfect men and women; some better than others, but ultimately all will not be able to undo the many damages set into place over the past many decades and centuries. Our best hope is in God and his Son. Most all politicians are corrupt also; they may try in the beginning, but it all becomes to easy when they "get into these positions of worldly power". Something changes -- IN ALL OF THEM. <br>  <br>  Bush screwed us for 8 years. Pull your behind up off your shoulders.|`|4405cb5dd585bee70aeaf6a964ff0b94aa	As long as he can do the job, I wouldn't care if he prayed to Quetzalcoatl.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	yes|`|OncdpDunaa	I hope with all my heart that he brings more spirituality and love into our nation.

God Bless|`|io7nHB3Oaa	He's also reversing the policy on stem cell research, so thankfully while he's playing lip service to religion he's at least being rational with his policies thus far.|`|b73d4eb6bf979588795fb3b329f48afaaa	When he let his religious faith make national policy decisions, then I'll worry.|`|VxrsfAfyaa	A prayer is not a religion.|`|fcF4uKA6aa	Not as much as Bush did|`|iZrNlSIJaa	He's doing it so the fanatics will shut up.|`|wukXoRCMaa	bush did the same thing|`|VhzhZP8jaa	Haha no! If you are fooled by his false display of religious concen, look again my friend. He is a political opportunist, much like McCain and he is getting as many people duped into thinking he is religious as he possibly can. Age- old political trick deary.<br>   As, a personal aside,If he cared about religion in the true sense of it, he would take a long look at his own deplorable religious track record and lack of commitment to anything morally solid and run and hide- that is, if he had the integrity to do so.|`|PyNjuiIUaa	He just overturned the ruling on stem cell research so he's not overly religious. He's got humans at the top of his priorities, not God or gods.|`|2bfbda31517a40fd64c290f16464ec40aa	I think that Obama was bringing too much religion into the White House, he would not be legalizing abortion.

1c3c1bf8b2165db543cc5709bc6b02c5aa	From a historical perspective:<br>  <br>  First of all, there is considerable evidence that the Norse pantheon only took on that form in reponse to the Vendel (pre-Norse) and Germanic tribes coming in contact with the Romans.  Since that only happened in the 1st century AD it can be safely said that the Norse god are NOT in fact older than the Christian God.  The Christians worship the same Creator God as the Jews and that can be strongly traced a good 2000 years before Christ.<br>  <br>  Second, the Norse first became aware of Christianity in the 8th century, the first conversions were in the 9th, Denmark became Christian in the 10th century, but Sweden not until the 12th.  However the fact that these Norse people were worshipping the Norse gods before they worshiped "The White Christ" does not say anything about the age of the gods themselves, only about the habits of a particular people group.  It's important (if one is going to be intellectually honest) not to confuse the two.|`|AA11849917	So, you say that before God created everything, these things existed?  Nonsense!  So, the Norse existed before God created them?  Where did you say you hid your brains?|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Creator trumps all !!!|`|4405cb5dd585bee70aeaf6a964ff0b94aa	Um... Not sure if you heard of the "Population Decides" argument yet. If all Gods do exist, all of them, the ones with the most followers are stronger than the others. When a deity has no followers, it will sleep until at least one returns to him. It's an old argument. I have to accept that my lord Anubis is considered weaker than Jehovah. I don't believe it, but I have to consider it.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	I suppose that they may use him as a sexual toy, with his baby blue eyes and long flowing hair.|`|aJLXBhoAaa	Nope the Christian God is supreme. The Norse and Loa gods are false gods.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no..<br>  <br>  you are thinking of myths..|`|g8EViy1Raa	Can anyone claiming these are false gods provide anything to back this up with?  Don't say 'because it says so in the bible' because it says in other religious texts that they are real gods too.  Why are you so arrogant to assume yours is the one true god?|`|bfP9vz9Naa	If the Norse Gods can push the Christian God around then the Christian God is not omnipotent and not worth worshiping.<br>  <br>  The Norse Gods are not older than the Christian God, the Christian God created the earth and was worshiped by Adam and Eve.|`|v80N4JB0aa	Well since humans created these gods, it is humans who control what they say and do<br>  <br>  Damn! Fireball admits god is a myth, we need to make a copy of this.|`|2671bdab4ecc3e9bb1c0c6539cea42f1aa	Never heard of these fake gods but let's be clear, there is only one TRUE God and he isn't controlled by anyone or anything.|`|C42YeDPuaa	The Flying Spaghetti Monster came before all.

YXGdwwTJaa	I do not know the detail, but they should be available on rocks and minerals somewhere.  Diamond is hard and so difficult to mark or destroy.  Opal rings should not be worn in water: it is alright to wash your hands, but take off an opal ring if you are washing up or keeping your hands in water for any length of time. The same applies to moonstone.  I am not sure but it cold be that water can get into the stone and it may fall out of its setting.  I lost a lovely moonstone from a special ring and never found it again.  With emerald, I would imagine that it would be sensible to treat this carefully.  It may stand up to water but do not try the diamond trick of rubbing it along glass, or bumping against a brick wall.|`|l9jtfrU4aa	A soft stone is a porous stone.

Their religion is the one that correctly interprets the real and only God. The others are "unfortunately" wrong and any "good Christian" should "help" them find the right path to God.<br>  Fortunately most Christians have accepted the separation of Church and State. this is not the case for Muslims, though.|`|VxrsfAfyaa	I have never discussed it with a Hindu.

Bible and Catechism are great ideas (although as an 11 year old I must admit I didn't read them much).<br>  <br>  I also remember thinking it would have been nice to have a nice set of rosaries like some of the other children had.

But in three years of teaching grade seven catechism, I always found children of that age more receptive to a necklass either a cross, crucifix, or I always had good results with anything depicting the Holy Spirit like a dove, or a tongue of fire. <br>    Make sure as their sponsor you stress the importance of "ASKING" God to send his Holy Spirit at their Confirmation (and after) and remind them if they ask they will receive.<br>                                                               Peace; D.D.|`|ahf98Vahaa	Would he appreciate a gold crucifix or cross, or maybe a leather bound Bible.

Jealous perhaps?<br>  <br>  Anyway the truth be told, the Queen does in fact still possess certain powers that would allow her to dissolve parliament and kick out the PM (although this would never happen due to the huge constitutional crisis that would result).<br>  <br>  Arguably her most important function is to act as a 'diplomat', being host to foreign dignitaries, making state visits - the thing is that the monarchy commands great respect abroad and that in itself is very useful.<br>  <br>  She is also the head of the commonwealth, providing a unifying figurehead for all nations involved. That and she is the supreme governor of the church of england and commander in chief of the armed forces (soldiers swear allegiance the the crown, not the government).<br>  <br>  Also, lets not forget the huge amount of charity work the monarchy performs, the queen is patron to many charities and organisations, giving a hell of a lot more than 95% of people in that regard.<br>  <br>  Lets not also forget the huge amount of revenue the monarchy generates through tourism. The monarchy costs each person in the UK 68p to keep per year.<br>  <br>  Im not a particularly pro-monarchy person (im not even fond of nationalism) but i detest moronic accusations thrown out by ignorant people who just think the queen sits around all day doing f*ck all. Its all brought on by jealousy - i wouldn't want her job.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To those who think that the UK becoming a republic is a good idea should really have a think about that. Theres a very good reason that we remain a constitutional monarchy - the queen acts as a check, a barrier to stop those in government from abusing constituitional powers - just look at nazi germany and hitlers consolidation of power - all legal, using their constitutional powers. Or you could even look closer to home with Cromwells republic - even they brought back the monarchy after they destroyed it to act as a check to stop britain from becoming a military dictatorship. Any country where the government has no such checks, corruption is higher. We have no less a democracy for having a queen than any republic and we are not, by any stretch of the imagination, "slaves" to the monarchy.|`|9e27b32bc3fee1168b70cd3e85c70c90aa	i watched something on that new channel "blighty" about the queen the other day. i was like you and wondered what she actually does, but this really opened my eyes. she actually does quite a lot. she was doing some paperwork for the country, but i actually cannot remember what it was about lol <br>  <br>  to be honest the royals do bore me, and i wasnt that interested in watching about the queen, but it showed her doing much more than just wave and wear hats...shes got a wicked sense of humour too!|`|10541eb54f0b51e5e05e9e92b9882bbaaa	advising or cautioning the Prime Minister|`|JWNzoksmaa	nothing she's an icon....thats all the royal family is anymore.  they are an icon to the past.|`|kafpYPC1aa	Drinks tea lol|`|ed658ab54221fdf8e76c9f6718308484aa	Fills her piehole and counts our money|`|d3P8dE4naa	idk...good question maybe shes just there to be a public figure...|`|kocCgRZwaa	There is not much she can do entirely at her own whim. Technically, she could dissolve Parliament to get rid of a Prime Minister she disliked, but it would provoke an unthinkable constitutional crisis if she tried. The great 19th-century journalist and constitutional scholar Walter Bagehot said the monarch had the prerogative "to be consulted, to encourage and to warn" the government of the day, but it is one Elizabeth II never exercises in public (unlike her opinionated son Charles). Yet she still derives power from her twin roles as head of state — the one who opens and dissolves Parliament, makes splashy visits abroad and hosts dinners for foreign leaders — and head of nation, a focus for British unity and identity, rewarder of excellence, a visible oasis of continuity in an accelerating world, even as Prime Ministers (she's had 10) come and go. A clutch of other symbolic roles — Head of the Commonwealth, Supreme Governor of the Church of England, chief of the armed forces — reinforce a peculiar kind of omnipresence in public life. In a media-soaked age, that is a fantastic asset. So actually she has a lot of power.|`|5QbDnnWMaa	I'm not sure, a few hundred years ago, they could kill people for their religions, but now, nothing really.

The Queen's duties include opening each new session of Parliament, dissolving Parliament before a general election, and approving Orders and Proclamations through the Privy Council.She signs laws,amendments into action;without her signature,Parliamentary statutes would just be pieces of paper.<br>  Her daily schedule:<br>  <br>  "The Queen's working day begins like many people's - at her desk. <br>  <br>  After scanning the daily British newspapers, The Queen reviews her correspondence. <br>  <br>  Every day, 200-300 (and sometimes many more) letters from the public arrive. The Queen chooses a selection to read herself and tells members of her staff how she would like them to be answered. <br>  <br>  This enables Her Majesty personally to see a typical cross-section of her daily correspondence. Virtually every letter is answered by staff in her Private Secretary's office or by a lady-in-waiting.<br>  <br>  The Queen will then see, separately, two of her Private Secretaries with the daily quota of official papers and documents. This process takes upwards of an hour.<br>  <br>  Every day of every year, wherever she is, The Queen receives from government ministers, and from her representatives in the Commonwealth and foreign countries, information in the form of policy papers, Cabinet documents, telegrams, letters and other State papers.<br>  <br>  These are sent up to her by the Private Secretaries in the famous 'red boxes'. All of these papers have to be read and, where necessary, approved and signed.<br>  <br>  A series of official meetings or 'audiences' will often follow. The Queen will see a number of important people.<br>  <br>  These include overseas ambassadors and high commissioners, newly appointed British ambassadors, senior members of the British and Commonwealth Armed Forces on their appointment and retirement, and English bishops and judges on their appointment. <br>  <br>  Each meeting usually lasts 10 to 20 minutes, and usually The Queen and her visitor meet alone.<br>  <br>  The Queen may also meet a number of people who have won prizes or awards in a variety of fields such as literature or science, to present them individually with their prize.<br>  <br>  If there is an Investiture - a ceremony for the presentation of honours and decorations - it begins at 11.00am and lasts just over an hour. The Queen usually meets around 100 people at each Investiture to present Orders, decorations and medals.<br>  <br>  The Queen will often lunch privately. Every few months, she and The Duke of Edinburgh will invite a dozen guests from a wide variety of backgrounds to an informal lunch. Occasionally, the guest list may consist of far fewer people, such as a newly appointed or retiring Governor-General and their guest. <br>  <br>  If The Queen is spending the morning on engagements away from her desk and other commitments, she will visit up to three venues before lunch, either alone or jointly with The Duke of Edinburgh.<br>  <br>  On a regional visit, The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh lunch with a wide variety of people in places ranging from town halls to hospitals."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/DayInTheLife/TheQueensworkingday/Afternoon" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/DayIn...</a> and <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/DayInTheLife/TheQueensworkingday/Evening.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/DayIn...</a><br>  continues her day.|`|NYU37jfGaa	She has an endless round of official engagements.

I bet she works a lot harder than you do, and certainly a lot harder than you will be working when you are 82.<br>  <br>  If we didn't have a Queen, we would have to have an elected President to fulfill all the functions she does.  Which would not be nearly so interesting and would probably cost a lot more (most Presidents are more expensive than the royal family).|`|AA11049477	She brings in money, she greets domestic & dignitaries from overseas, when GW came over to the UK, he even stayed at buckingham palace........<br>  She does an important & remarkable job selling the UK, bring in investment etc etc.<br>  So they say.<br>  I think she needs to go & the UK becomes a Republic, we have a false democracy because of this out-dated, inequality ridden, blatant favouritism of the monarchy.<br>  If we are all supposed to be equal, classless & living in the 21st century, 100 years or so since the end of slavery <br>  why are we still slaves to this bunch of scroungers?<br>  She has to go & take all the hangers-on with her.|`|2UDbOpxTaa	I answer all your boring questions.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sometimes I also text in to those TV shows where you can win a new washing machine or something.

For it is a land of graven images, and because of [their] frightful visions they keep acting crazy.<br>  Just as anchiet Babylon's waters were dried up by Cyrus the great,(History tells us) so her waters are drying up people do not see a need to follow false leaders who speak lies about the true God.They teach false doctrines that make no sense at all.They depict God as a monstor,he takes our loved ones,burns us in hell etc.That is why this prophecy is soon to be fulfilled (Revelation 18:21) And a strong angel lifted up a stone like a great millstone and hurled it into the sea, saying: “Thus with a swift pitch will Babylon the great city be hurled down, and she will never be found again.<br>  <br>  What does the Bible really teach?

QSAPw7AOaa	Because I think for a lot of people the internet is a refuge, where people can anonymously take out their bitterness and aggression on others. I think a lot of people who frequent these kind of sites probably aren't the happiest people in the world, they're not happy with the way their lives are going, they don't have much of a social life, and that can get you bitter after a while, speaking for myself, I know I have felt this before. It sounds like you also have some problems, you're not happy, and you can get some real advice on here, but really, don't expect all helpful answers, some are just here for the hell of it, not to help people or get help from people.|`|6X4rh4JXaa	thats just life. not everyone is going to approach you the way you want them to. <br>  <br>  but some of them think its funny and its not, wasting our time to be a pain in the *** when were trying to be serious, the internet holds alot of answers and its ppl like them that mess it up for the rest of us.|`|Z2fgQRAvaa	Some people are very insecure themselves.

Sadly, too many people are offended by the gospel, the Truth that is Jesus.  Many wish to blame Christians for their hatred toward Christianity, when it is actually the message that offends them.  Christ warned His disciples that the world would hate them because they hated HIM first.<br>  That being said, people are people.  Often Christians forget that their job is to go and share the good news.  When it is not received well, they need to shake the dust off their shoes and continue the walk.  Our job is to share the news and it is the work of the Holy Spirit to convict and seal.  <br>  We are Ambassadors of Christ and therefore ought to behave in a manner that represents Christ's kingdom and not our own.  When we remember our position in Christ, we don't need to take it personally when someone responds negatively.  As I said before, most often it is the message that offends and not the messenger initially.<br>  <br>  Blessings|`|JxUFDutxaa	I agree.<br>  I'm also Christian and understand that bashing someone for their beliefs is wrong.<br>  <br>  But..it can go both ways..I see alot of questions with Atheists bashing Christians and that's wrong too.<br>  <br>  We should all just agree to disagree and be done with it.|`|0sOnf2YQaa	I think that people should be treated kindly and with compassion and the Gospel message never compromised.<br>  I also would never refer to the Great Commission as "all that jazz"<br>  If that offends you, so be it.|`|NrzxtivLaa	I appreciate the sentiment, however, I've found that the fundies' attacks are about as effective as trying to attack an M1 Abrams tank with a tableknife|`|FDVCYENLaa	For a lot them, I think it's probably because it's easier to feel like a 'good' christian by attacking others rather than looking at yourself and trying to be a better person.|`|206820c72192d15525008e6de3c12f85aa	Oh great............2 chin-strap penguins going head to head.......|`|uD8d5V9Saa	Why are you bad mouthing Christians?

It is the same thing as music and movies. The reasons why certain people like or dislike certain movies/music are extremely varied...same thing with belief.

g7bQ9zSvaa	It's a wonderful thing.  At the church I used to attend, there was a man, previously a staunch athiest, who was a senior financial worker, and was very successful in the workplace, but not so successful at the rest of life.  He had gone to an expensive hotel with the view of squandering his money before taking his life.  However, when he read the message of hope of Christ in the Gideon's bible, he said something something touched him and he started to cry.  He prayed to God for the first time in his life, and last I heard, he hasn't looked back.  Hotels can be such lonely places when you're there alone - people may be going through all sorts of crises, marital problems, employment etc. it's the perfect place to find comfort in a God who cares about you.  So many people seem so offended by it, but it's not their money being invested into it and they can choose to ignore it. Some people are at a point in life where they need it.  I'm grateful these bibles are there, even if it were just for the one man whose life was saved and how he has gone on to enrich my life and the lives of those around him.  I'm sure there are other people who have benefited directly and indirectly.|`|AA11654248	I've never been concerned by Bibles in hotel rooms (although the first answerer makes a good point) as long as there is plenty of storage space - I have thrown the gideon's bible in the rubbish bin in the past when it was taking space in the only functional drawer in the room.|`|0puMsQJgaa	Dear G,<br>  <br>  I traveled quite extensively. NOT all hotels have Bibles. In areas like Utah where there is a Strong Mormon influence there are their Book of Mormon and The Bible.<br>  <br>  I am already a Christian.  One does not need examples about what God's Word does or does not do, because He says...<br>  <br>  (Hebrews 4:12-13)  For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul and spirit, joints and marrow, as it judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart.<br>  <br>  (Heb 4:13)  No creature can hide from him, but all are naked and helpless before the eyes of the one to whom we must give a word of explanation.<br>  <br>  AND...<br>  <br>  (Jeremiah 23:29)  Is not My Word like a fire? says Jehovah; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?<br>  <br>  Thanks for Asking!

I was in a Marriott so they had the book of Mormon.

It was dreadful... really the worst religious book I ever read.<br>  <br>  How did it affect me... well - reading it helped me fall to sleep, and I confirmed my shock that anyone could believe that stuff!|`|r8rykCkGaa	I always carry my own Bible with me, but I think this practice of putting them in the hotel rooms is marvelous.  There are people who go in to those places and they are very down and may be suicidal or on the verge of disaster and they pick up the Bible and it gives them the needed hope, and many are saved this way.  Very good!|`|UWKF7x4faa	If no cigarette papers are at hand it comes in handy.  For some reason the OT burns alot more evenly than the NT.

If you have never tried to have a christian walk you wouldn't think that it was a cakewalk.  Getting a emmy to get a ticket to heaven is too easy compared to christianity.  <br>  Christians face persecution, ridicule and possibly death for their beliefs and trying to share them with some people.  We believe and have faith in the things that can't be seen with the physical eye.  You have to follow the rules of the bible to keep the salvation that is offered to you.   <br>  Try and follow Jesus and tell me that is easier than winning a grammy or donating money to charity. Things are not always as easy as they look!!!|`|ywvYFQ0daa	On the contrary, I would say the road of Christian faith is the hard one. It actually requires us to think about someone other than ourselves - constantly and consistently. <br>  <br>  It involves much more than just a little prayer to Jesus, too - although that's where it can start.<br>  <br>  After all, if donating $10,000 to UNICEF becomes a goal, then what good is it when people make the donation without having a heart for why they're doing it.|`|DDwecKakaa	No I think there way is cool. Say "I believe in Casper" and your free to take your congregations money, preach against gay sex then participate in it, then still be on track for the heaven bus. <br>  <br>  Actually the Catholics have the tough rode. I think you have to memorize and pray to about 362 different saints before you get to Jesus, God, and then the mother of Heaven, Mary.|`|cg5kVPnIaa	Yeah, we obviously have to.  There are the 10 commandments that need to be followed, 7 deadly sins to avoid.  We have to live right to go to Heaven, Jesus will forgive us, but we have to do what is right.  Bad Christians aren't just going to get a free ticket to Heaven, they have to change and repent quickly.  It's not that easy, trust me.|`|vxZckDZ8aa	Its not for Christians to decide how we get to heaven, that is Gods place...|`|VxrsfAfyaa	No, that would be Scientology.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	That would be to downplay Jesus as St Paul is constantly emphasizing. You can't qualify for Hell  if you have any excuse at all. As it is, when you die Jesus says 'Did you care about God and the things of God ?"<br>  <br>  -- what you propose is a way to buy Him off, but He sees through you. <br>  <br>  Just like the Psalm says :<br>  7<br>      Those who trust in their wealth and boast of their abundant riches?<br>  8<br>      4 One cannot redeem oneself, pay to God a ransom.<br>  9<br>      Too high the price to redeem a life; one would never have enough<br>  10<br>      To stay alive forever and never see the pit.<br>  11<br>      Anyone can see that the wisest die, the fool and the senseless pass away too, and must leave their wealth to others.<br>  <br>  ...<br>  16  But God will redeem my life <br>  <br>  ========================<br>  See, you've played into the Devil's hands. It is such an appealing trap.|`|aJLXBhoAaa	Nope I will never deny my God. My relationship with God is number 1 in my life. I'm free of all sin and I am going to Heaven someday.|`|cKuppxUQaa	There is a lot more to being a Christians than accepting Him as our Savior. We must strive to live as Christ like as is humanly possible and that is not always easy. We are persecuted for our beliefs and ridiculed and we have to put up with so many who make fun of Jesus and mock Him. We are not perfect. I give to a lot of charities and i am not trying to win an emmy. Have you donated to UNICEF or won an emmy? Judge not lest you be judged.|`|89MKzLl3aa	All you have to do is to accept Jesus Christ as the Messiah. Christians will be judged as well and be given rewards for their faithful service. People who are Christians do express their faith by giving and supporting those in need. Some Christians are just more considerate than other Christians.|`|oVHFz52Laa	There is nothing we can do for our salvation but accept the free gift Jesus is offering. However, you can read from James what is expected from us once we already are Christians and saved. You realize that it is a great thing we are saved by mercy. We would not make it. We desperately need to be forgiven|`|PKULDaC7aa	But if it was too hard to get into heaven how would they bolster their ranks?

Don't loiter around as if the guy will change his mind. and you're her friend have you told her that she doesn't have a chance in hell with him. I would just tell her plainly.

I can't stand when people come in from outside just reaking of smoke and we can't do anything about it.|`|d4fdcfd497acff42297153ae1caa813eaa	I do not smoke but rather would smell smoke than a bottle of cologne. I never understood the cologne thing or perfume at work for that matter.|`|2BEMSGPdaa	I myself being an ex  smoker have to say this is the first I have heard of a Fragrance ban. It sounds great. I have been more sickened by smells than and cigarette smell. I would luv the fragrance people to suffer  like the smokers do.|`|rThIVk2maa	Perhaps you could take it upon yourself to get enough signatures on a petition to have a no-smoking policy instated. This will not, of course, make you any friends, but you could try if it's bothering you so much.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately though, the company cannot control people's odors completely and if  they choose to smell like smoke or even not bathe, well, that's their prerogative.

My place of worship also bans fragrances for that reason. Even if you don't talk to someone you're forced to smell their cologne/perfume which is obviously very wrong no different than being forced to see a naked person just because they feel like not wearing clothes. We have to have laws to protect us from imposing others wants onto us, but cigarettes are smoked outside and puffed out, leaving only their breath to stink which if you are not face to face with the person you will not smell. <br>  <br>  If your employer were to ban cigarette smoke then they'll might as well ban eating garlic at lunch too which would make someone smell worse.

Parents should be prosecuted for neglect if the do not provide for the health care of their children.

Protecting innocent children is paramount!|`|tx4bRDrXaa	True Christians love their families and will do whatever it takes to help them.This is child abuse.Praying for cures and like some religions do who handle snakes and drink poison goes contrary to Bible teachings.) Is it not tempting God, or presumptuously challenging him, to play with snakes, fire, or poison? Does not such testing indicate a gross lack of faith on the part of the worshiper, an attempt to force God to prove himself true to his Word by spectacular deeds“And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”<br>  <br>  First, it should be noted that almost all Bible scholars agree that these verses were not originally part of Mark’s Gospel. “The doubtful genuineness of verses 9-20 makes it unwise to build a doctrine or base an experience on them (especially vv. 16-18),” points out noted commentator Charles Ryrie.|`|hiCSVwchaa	No.  A parent's religious beliefs should not automatically be ascribed to the child.<br>  <br>  A child can make decisions about religion and medical care at 18, before that the child should receive the standard of care for their condition.|`|89MKzLl3aa	It's the parents choice.

But they have NO right doing that to a child just because they produced him.|`|dFBccLExaa	Nope. Even with religion, they shouldn't be allowed to deny their child healthcare. ...That is, if they can even afford it.|`|AA12194228	There have been many occasions where the medical providers have gotten court orders to legally treat the child with what will save him or her.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	I  bet those people consider themselves "pro-life" too.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	Not on your life.|`|URO3gDXcaa	no|`|wT9PTRgtaa	The child is under the protection of the parents,they will give the best to the child if they love him and believe in god.If they really believed in god,they would have treated the child even for mild illness,for god helps those who help themselves,not those who try to show off something they don't have.|`|8Zey1ntAaa	There is a line to be drawn somewhere, but when it is practically guaranteed that the medical treatment will be effective then withholding that treatment is tantamount to child abuse.|`|OSesKrXaaa	You mean like Madeline Neumann or John Travolta?

YJVmL9Ubaa	THE  greek and hindu god(s) roots trace back to the earliest civilization mesopotamia(baal worship,nimrod"the rebel" and the first "fertility goddess" who was nimrod's wife,the christian god(YHWH) IS  dated back in ancient tablets to that same time period,nimrod is also the same person gilgamesh.|`|d68957dacb144784b5f36ca557b990e3aa	I would think that would fairly blatant.<br>  <br>  The Christian God does not hold human-esque characteristics like the Greek and Hindu gods do, therefore presenting a further gap of power and knowledge between God and man. The Christian God, although coexisting as three, is only one. Greek theology is a polytheistic society and Hindu doctrine is monistic. The differences between these deities are endless.|`|Z9r5lphvaa	The Greek and Hindu gods that most people refer to are really in  a "mid-level"(if you please) Godly Management.

Ofcourse, if they wish to.<br>  This is the Param Brahm (God).<br>  <br>  Christianity talks of the son of God. One could route the requests/prayers/messages through him.<br>  btw, if you were to study greek mythology and Indian mythology, you'd find fascinating similarities.|`|NBJF2UcBaa	i think that the idea that jesus sacrificed himself is irrational it resembles the ancient religions also the date of birth of jesus is like the date of birth of many other ancient egyptian and greek gods. what i believe in is that jesus was a great prophet just like the other prophets god sent him to let people know him and worship him(god not jesus) and he rose jesus to him and he wasnt killed but people misunderstood this and thought that jesus was god.|`|paRGbr7Xaa	The Christian god's destruction and death serves no purpose. The Greek and Hindu gods have reason for any destruction (ie creation). Plus, Yahweh's more of a jerk. None of the others send you to eternal punishment for simply not worshiping them.|`|zcwSIBHwaa	The main difference is that Christians consider their God omnipotent and above all laws. The Greek and Hindu Gods were limited by some "natural" or "cosmic" laws that they couldn't break.|`|4xptqJrOaa	Priest of Anubis must have gotten his great answer from a comic book.|`|dFBccLExaa	The Christian god is supposedly all good and all knowing and all that hoobily ha. <br>  The Hindu and Greek gods all had their own character traits, their own flaws. They don't smite down people for worshipping other gods, and they know that they have their own issues- instead of masquerading around under the guise of "I'm all that and a bag of potato chips"<br>  Other deities are more approachable in general.|`|NrzxtivLaa	the holy book used.....|`|fDUCEX3Haa	I don't understand some of these people's answers. How can you understand and answer a question like this unless you know the about Christian God(s) and about the Greek Gods and about the Hindu Gods. Most people know nothing about Hinduism to begin with. How can you say the Geek and Hindu Gods are just statues, when in Christianity there are physical representations of Jesus and the Virgin Mary in pictures and statues as well. Do you worship those statues, no, its all symbolism. The Christian God isn't really any different from other Gods, it's just that God has so many different forms and meanings that people give them.|`|4405cb5dd585bee70aeaf6a964ff0b94aa	If you believe in the Trinity, none. If you believe Jehovah is the only God and Jesus was just his son, quite a few. If you go beyond the Human Characteristics that do not exist with Jehovah, he is the ONLY god, there are no others. If you believe in the Trinity, you have Jehovah and two other deities, the Holy Ghost and Christ, two other Gods under him, just as you would have Hera and Poseidon under Zeus, Horus and Anubis under Ra, the list just goes on. Trinity is no different than Paganism. For anyone arguing this, the three gods making up one god, no, three gods making up one pantheon.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	Neither the Greek or Hindu gods are quite as misogynistic for one.|`|czf6uhIraa	The Christian god is much more of an *sshole than any of the Greek or Hindu gods.

wND7qPTWaa	The ancient Israelites had a significantly different understanding of life-beyond-death than we as Catholic Christians do. These ancient Hebrew people had no sense of life-beyond-death at all.<br>  Ancient Israelites who heard and then later who read the story about Jacob and the stairway to heaven, the emphasis was on God's provision for the people in the here and now. Jacob's Ladder in this biblical context really didn't have any particular importance for life-after-death. <br>  <br>  However, when early Christianity decided to adopt the Hebrew Bible as an integral part of our own Scripture, we started reading those ancient stories from a different point-of-view. And clearly the Resurrection of the Lord made belief in life-after-death one of the primary tenets of our Christian faith. So, when Christians would read the Hebrew Scriptures we saw God's revelation of different meaning in those Scriptures than had the early Hebrew people. <br>  <br>  From that Christian perspective, then, the story of Jacob's dream, with the stairway in it, came to have a different meaning and significance. <br>  <br>  We still see that the messengers going up and down the stairway suggests God's willingness to provide for us on our earthly journey, but we also see another meaning implicit in Jacob's dream. <br>  <br>  Since we know that we are destined to share the Lord's Resurrection, we believe in life-after-death. Furthermore, we believe that in the great communion of saints we are 'connected to' those who have gone before marked with the sign of faith -- as Eucharistic Prayer  says. <br>  <br>  The "ladder" came to be seen by Christians as representing that "link" between heaven and earth which binds us to those saints whom we celebrate on All Saints' Day. <br>  <br>  God's messengers going up and down came to represent the fact that our prayers can assist those souls in Purgatory who are awaiting their final entrance into the full glory of heaven. <br>  Just as the messengers brought help to Jacob in the dream and as they carried Jacob's supplication and prayer up to heaven, so they represent our prayers "going up Jacob's ladder" on behalf of the faithful departed. <br>  <br>  Re-incarnation has nothing to do with the soul.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	there is no reincarnation and has nothing to do with jacob's ladder or the soul.<br>  <br>  There is no burning of bodies after death|`|KVBTtF9faa	Reincarnation is when the soul incarnates (lives) again in another body and has another experience of "life". Though if the soul never dies, just changes form and incarnations, then there really is no such thing as "life" or "death" in a spiritual sense, only in a physical sense. <br>  <br>  I have no idea what it has to do with Jacob's ladder or burning bodies though. Good luck. You're likely to just get a bunch of people telling you reincarnation isn't real though.

And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus, full of sores, who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table; moreover the dogs came and licked his sores."<br>  <br>  "The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried; and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom. And he called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.'"<br>  <br>  "But Abraham said, 'Son, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.'"<br>  <br>  "And he said, 'Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house, for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.'"<br>  <br>  "But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.'"<br>  <br>  "And he said, 'No, father Abraham; but if some one goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'"<br>  <br>  "He said to him, 'If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if some one should rise from the dead.'"

vSeSyelGaa	My mom and I have talked about this kind of thing a lot. I think it is possible to know things before they actually happen - whether that is being psychic or not, who knows? There have been experiences in my life and my mom's life that have been strange - for example - when my sister was about a year old my mom left her with my uncle and was walking to the store. She felt something telling her to turn around because my sister was hurt, but she didn't listen. When she got home my sister had fallen on a gas stove and burnt her arm.  <br>  Another time when we were coming home my mom felt something telling her to take the back road instead.  She did and later we found out that there had been an accident and if she had stayed on the main road we most likely would have been involved.  <br>  One other thing that actually happened to me -- when I was in high school a girl from my school attempted suicide. She was in the hospital and they weren't sure if she was going to make it. I dreamed one night that she had died, and when I woke up my mom told me she had died that same night at about one in the morning.  <br>  I do believe in psychic abilities to a degree, and I think I possess some of these "abilities," too many things have happened in my life for me not to believe.  Maybe it's just not the typical psychic that we think of.|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	My s/o and I were discussing this same subject just yesterday.  Are people really psychic?

He's the smartest person I know and I trust him so I would say, yes, there are people with psychic abilities but they're not 100% correct on 100% of the questions they're asked.

Seeing dead people?<br>  <br>  I think everyone has some sort of psychic sense. For almost all it is very weak and uncontrollable. Everyone can remember some sort of odd thing in his or her life that can be attributed to psychosis. A bad feeling about a certain option or just *knowing* something is wrong with a loved one. However, because of ridicule many people are afraid to open up about it.<br>  <br>  One thing that bugs me is all this New Age nonsense that has been mixed up with this phenomenon. It tries to use psychics to pass off its BS as believable. <br>  <br>  However, the Bible does have people with psychic powers. Some, like Joseph and Daniel, could interpret dreams. Others could perform miracles. Others delivered supernatural messages. The important thing to note is the source of psychic powers. All energy has a source, and if it comes from an intelligent source, it might come with a price.

GahpE5U2aa	I googled it.<br>  <br>  Awrah (Arabic: ?????) is a term used within Islam which denotes the parts of the body that are not meant to be exposed in public. This concept is, therefore, linked with hijab, or sartorial hijab.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awrah" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awrah</a><br>  <br>  So you've already got this awrah. ;)<br>  <br>  Since you're a man:<br>  In Sunni interpretations, the awrah of a man refers to the part of the body between the navel and the knees. Neither men nor women should uncover their genitals at any time except when in privacy. Men and women should at all times wear garments that are loose and the material is not transparent as to see the skin colour and shape of the other (male or female)<br>  <br>  So basically we're speaking of CLOTHES. Yes, you can get clothes at the mall, love. =)

A few religions promised a more pleasant after life, while those who followed some religions from outside Rome believed in reincarnation or a heaven type place, like earth only better.   Romans tended to pick and choose.
TT0rCi8kaa	Because God gave Lucifer the Kingdoms of the Earth to rule, and he is the Rightful Lord of the Earth. Otherwise he could not have offered Jesus Dominion over all the Kingdoms, during his 40 days in the Desert. Likewise, when he tempts Jesus to throw himself from the cliff, "that his Father send Angels to stop his fall", Lucifer was demonstrating that the Heavenly Host had no Power on Earth, that was not sanctioned by him. <br>  "Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's" is also an oblique reference to the fact that worldly goods are not part of that which is Gods domain. Of course, the fact that Satan rules this Earth, is not an <br>  excuse to worship Him, just to acknowledge that He is the Master of this World, and to ignore this fact would be Dangerously stupid.|`|ZNRYqss9aa	No it's basically saying Satan has influences over what we do.|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	Revelation 12:9<br>  So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who DECEIVES THE WHOLE WORLD; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are only 144,000 that God revealed himself to and has called into a relationship with himself over the last 6000 years. They are in the first resurrection and will rule and reign with Jesus Christ during the Millenial reign when Jesus returns to begin the Kingdom of God.<br>  <br>  Revelation 14<br>  <br>   1Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads. 2And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps. 3And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. 4These are those who did not defile themselves with women (false religion), for they kept themselves pure. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among men and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb. 5No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.<br>  <br>  By the way, the sealing of those 144,000 has been completed. Those who's minds are being opened to the truth through repentance now are being given oppurtunity to live into the millenial reign of Jesus Christ that is soon to come to this Earth. They will not be in the Kingdom of God but will be ruled by it.|`|mgM1Ot3Oaa	i think it means that if God allows it, satan can do anything to the world since he is the ruler of all evil|`|DZCFD0p2aa	That was talking about George Bush.|`|07f7853a89aa3cda6f880c27d1d66e86aa	The ruler of this world in the Bible refers to satan, and that is why we are not to conform to the world, or to be like the world. That is why the Jews were set apart from the world as God's chosen "out" of the world. That is why when Jesus rebukes the specific Pharisees, He makes the distinction of who their father is, and that it is not His Father.<br>  <br>  As for why God allows satan to do anything, I would say because it is necessary according to His plan...perhaps it is, that God allowing satan to do anything at all is like the Judge allowing the condemned one last walk in the open air before execution, or allowing them to have more rope with which to hang themselves. I do not know.<br>  <br>  He allowed satan to afflict Job, and it was certainly for our benefit, to teach us that bad things will happen, but that faithfulness in hard times is far more important than our present circumstance might imply, and to demonstrate God's Faithfulness, Love and Awesome Power to His people for His glory. <br>  <br>  It helps to teach us that we aren't to just praise God when everything is going our way and life is great, but even when things go terribly wrong and life is a struggle...God is always in control and always with us and has already saved us no matter what this world may throw at us.<br>  <br>  Take Care and God Bless you.|`|FXniymT6aa	this whole concept of satan and god is from an era and people who were and in a lot of cases still are unevolved mentally emotionally<br>  and spiritually and so a  wrathfulll god was created to subdue there animal wildness man needs to grow up and inot saying in age <br>  most leaders are  at the psychological age of about 14 if that ,just watch <br>  them they ,are unfit for the job and because they are unfit then madness is what they create theres no little satan sitting around making trouble it is man who is responsible and there is the gate to heaven and hell  and leaders by there madness to be leaders nearly always chose hell and blame god or satan for there actions look at blair and bush   ,  god told me to do it|`|MSHxYrLEaa	jesus also said that satan is the ruler of this system of things<br>  <br>  also, satan tempted jesus by offering him all the nations of the world, so how could he offer what he did not have?<br>  <br>  <br>  this all goes back to the garden of Eden, Satan challenged gods authority to rule, so god stepped back and said "ok, you try then"<br>  <br>  he had to do this, as destroying Satan right away would cause others to question gods authority, there was the angels, and Adam and eve<br>  <br>  this, now, is Satan's world, and it is failing.<br>  <br>  god will eventually stop back in and say "ok, you have proven you cant do it".<br>  <br>  humans just cant do it, no human government has been perfect. so again, it has been proven humans cant rule ourselves<br>  <br>  this will prove once and for all, to all the angels, and us on earth, that there is only one person fit to rule the earth.<br>  <br>  almighty god jehovah|`|uOZqu5wAaa	You really don't have to look too far......like tv, newspaper, radio......to see that this world is a mess and it's only getting worse.

The ten step program for addicts is basically like converting you to christianity:<br>  We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable. <br>  Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. <br>  Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him. <br>  Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. <br>  Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. <br>  Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character. <br>  Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings. <br>  Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all. <br>  Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others. <br>  Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. <br>  Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His Will for us and the power to carry that out. <br>  Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Jesus said that the tax collectors, sinners, and prostitutes all enter heaven more easily, and it seems to be because they believe easier.

You don't know every individual who has experienced these things so therefore your generalization is false. <br>  <br>  I never replaced alcohol addiction with religion, because I actually still struggle with alcohol at times.

A few do not have this tendency and so are more able to question beliefs and to disbelieve.  <br>  <br>  Another factor is the amount and intensity of relgious indoctrination that a person receives at a young age.  It is very difficult for one brought up in the stricter religious traditions to ever break away.<br>  <br>  Apparently more, in Britain, believe in ghosts and the paranormal than in traditional religions.

FyLfEPv0aa	Of course we do.<br>  <br>  Now, for those who choose to spread rumors on here with their answers let's clear those up as well:<br>  <br>  We do believe that Christ is an eternal God, we don't believe that He became God but that He was God coming down to the earth to atone for our sins which didn't make Him a God but rather was a job that only a God could do.<br>  <br>  We don't believe that he was a polygamist.<br>  <br>  Since Christ called Himself the "Son of God" we hold that to be true.  All other creations including us are also children of God.  Satan rebelled against God as Isaiah stated yet is still subject to God and thus is also a rebellious creation of God.  So in the sense that we're all children of God then Satan and Jesus would be brothers with billions of other people too.  So that's a unversal truth in Christianity that's twisted to make us sound odd.|`|AA10637643	We most certainly do.

But reading the entire OT in one chunk is pretty overwhelming if you've not read it before. I'd recommend starting with the key narrative books (Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, Ezra, Nehemiah, and 1 Maccabees), and then read Luke and Acts in the NT.  After that, you'll have a good foundation for where the rest of the books of the Bible fit into the salvation narrative.|`|EiyhWrwwaa	Yes.

Trees are converted to lumber, iron ore infused with carbon in the form of ash is converted to steel. You get the gist.<br>  <br>  Yet how does this explain the existence of the universe? How did the universe come into being? Was there not a point in time and space where there was nothing? The big bang only explains the rapid expansion, evolution and distribution of matter that resulted in the universe, NOT it's origin. So if the greatest thing (ie the universe) was spontaneously created from absolutely nothing would not logic dictate that some sort of 'being' who exists without the confines and constraints of science be responsible for the creation of the matter that resulted in the rapid expansion of the big bang?|`|hHGNE0IRaa	I was forced to as a child, but I actually don't believe a biblical God exists.

I was raised in Christian home and my father was a minister. When I reached middle school, my father decided he didn't want to believe in God anymore and he eventually left the family. I was taught to be independent and think through all my decisions, and my father's choices forced me to examine my own beliefs. I went off to college at 17 and was bombarded with a variety of beliefs and non-beliefs that differed from my own. No one was around to tell me what to do, so I had to figure it out for myself. The fact that I was a Biology major made things a bit more tricky because it's assumed that Science and Religion just don't mix. I've since graduated and learned to reconcile my faith with my education. I don't live with my family, so no one is forcing me to go to church or anything. I still believe in God because I have experienced Him in my own life.|`|T7CNCDcZaa	Yes.

At that time, I was agnostic. I studied the major religions; i.e. Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, etc. in school. The only one that interested me was Judaism.  I felt an emptiness when I was outside of church; nothing could fill it. In hindsight, I realize that I have always been a deeply spiritual person. I came back to the Christian faith and became Roman Catholic. Faith is still difficult for me; allowing God to have complete control over my life. I am fiercely independent;  “letting go, let God is a challenge.” My walk with Jesus is like a hound following a scent. He chased me; not letting me escape. It is a mad, passionate love affair.

When you say 'dating', does that mean that you never got further than a date with these girls?  And when you say you were attracted to them, did you mean that you thought they were pretty or that you wanted them in bed with you?

tfkpNh89aa	Indeed they are the same being...  <br>  <br>  Holy Spirit is the Holy Ghost..  there is nothing different from spirit/ghost.  It's just terminology.  A spirit is a ghost and a ghost is a spirit.  No different. <br>  <br>  It's God's / Christ's soul/spirit that dwells in all of us who believe. <br>  <br>  Chapter 28 of St. Matthew...  <br>  <br>  Verse #18 - 20<br>  <br>  Then Jesus approached and said to them, "All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. <br>  <br>  Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Spirit, <------***<br>  <br>  Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, until the end of the age." <br>  <br>  The last 2 statements above is the Holy Spirit/Holy Ghost/Paraclete/Comforter.<br>  <br>  300 years later the church labeled this saying as the "Trinity"|`|H8WqMK1eaa	It is only the King James Version of the Bible which uses the term “Holy Ghost.” It occurs 90 times in the KJV. The term “Holy Spirit” occurs 7 times in the KJV. There is no clear reason as to why the KJV translators used Ghost in most places and then Spirit in a few. The exact same Greek and Hebrew words are translated "ghost" and "spirit" in the KJV in different occurrences of the words. By "ghost," the KJV translators did not intend to communicate the idea of "the spirit of a deceased person." In 1611, when the KJV was originally translated, the word "ghost" primarily referred to "an immaterial being."|`|oGVvEl3Maa	yes.  but i am not sure that we call the Holy Spirit a 'Being'... such as Allah Subhana wa Ta'ala... the Holy Spirit is Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  God is Spirit... and thus the Holy Spirit is from Him... that is my understanding.  more like [Ruh] <br>  <br>  there is no difference in Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost... they are the same... and are used interchangeably.<br>  <br>  warm wishes and best regards...

It is not another "being" because in Christianity God is not a "being." "Beings" are created things. The Holy Spirit is God in Christianity. God is not the same thing as his creation and therefore God is not a "being" - God is the source of all "being."  In Christianity, God is not some great Cosmic Sheikh or giant "being" somewhere in outer space that literally sits on a giant throne. According to the Gospel of John, Jesus said: "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth." (4:24).|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	we will never know unless we can get the original words in the original Hebrew of the time those were used (as words change meaning by time)<br>  nad in Aramaic at the time jesus spoke specially when he said the Spirit of Truth (which is also said to mean the Holy Spirit)<br>  <br>  I may agree for the first 2: Holy Spirit - the Holy Ghost<br>  <br>  But, as a Muslim of course I disagree on the last one as I believe that Jesus meant Mohammad by the Spirit of Truth.|`|zBqt99avaa	Same thing, as far as I know.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	"They" are One in the Same!  :D
7ca5c6cf814ffe44b145b050ae60323aaa	It is a biblical principal to test yourself to see that you are in the faith (2 Cor 13).  It is a biblical command to remind ourselves of the warnings and the promises (2 Peter 1:12).  We should always be on guard against the works of the Devil which come in many ways, remembering that we battle against rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms (Eph 6:12).<br>  <br>  Atheists are non-believers because of the things you read in Romans 1.  Also, because God has not granted them belief, and they see God and his instruction as foolishness.  Besides, no one is really an Atheist.  Everyone believes ina God of some sort.  Atheists see themselves as controlling their own destiny.  For that, their God is themselves.  And believe me, they question it all the time.  Even if they deny it to show a front of strength.  No one goes through life without questioning things like reason and purpose.|`|qp5EFetJaa	Oh your god...<br>  <br>  Mr. Rothschild, what the hell are you talking about?

When one is aware of how flimsy the empirical evidence is for ones belief is, one must chronically consider WHY one chooses to believe, then continually renew ones commitment to that faith.  The believer who claims certainty has stopped thinking about what his/her faith means and refuses to grow, making that "faith" susceptible to the next passing novelty.<br>  <br>  Thoughtful atheists examine religious beliefs and, for a variety of reasons, don't find them compelling enough to make a faith commitment.  Often they commit to more secular, human-oriented ideas.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Well when you have dragons, unicorns, and talking donkeys you'd expect that it would make you think about it every once in a while.|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Questioning your faith is as healthy as questioning a countries motives - it keeps you honest.<br>  <br>  As for the second one... pretty self-explanatory, no?|`|jR8mclWIaa	There is no evience for the existence of God.|`|vhlORK4Waa	I woud say in order to better understand both it, and themselves! Most faiths require one to learn, to examine, to better understand, and not to blindly follow.  If one's knowledge not just of your own faith but others, and related topics such as archaeology, anthrolpology, mythology, folklore, ancient civilisations and social science, is increased, then that csan only be of benefit to you personally, and the understanding of your own faith. At least, that's what I have found!<br>  <br>  Atheists I presume have examined numerous faiths, or even just the concept of faith, or deity, and have found them wanting that is why they "don't believe"...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Halcon<br>  <br>  Halcon|`|wia35rNKaa	I honestly wonder that myself...I have a friend that is catholic through and through, and I am an atheist.<br>  And he says that he questions his faith...that is something he deals with all the time.<br>  <br>  For me, the next logical step in the doubting of faith is to not believe. Take the next step and finish the damn thing. But I have a feeling that he has so much invested in his faith and religion that it seems like too big a thing to let go. Plus his father was extremely religious and passed away when he was 17, so that obviously did not help in him letting things go.<br>  But I do wonder...if you do seriously continue asking yourself if its real or not, is that really the best tye of relationship to have with anything/anyone? I do love how the church's response to this is that the devil (yet another man made invention) places that doubt there for you to overcome. Oh for crying out loud.<br>  <br>  I dont know why atheists are such non believers...I know why I am. I opened my eyes, opened my ears, imagined what it would be like if there was no god, and pursued that way of thinking in watching and reading anything and everything I can get my hands on concerning religion. One of the most difficult things for me is the illogical step people make from A to C...They may ask, why are we here...we dont know, so it must be god.

That's the message coming from administration officials. That's what other sources seem to be telling other journalists. <br>  <br>  Sometime, most likely in November, America will begin a strategic aerial bombardment of Iraq that will lead shortly thereafter to an invasion designed to topple the regime of Saddam Hussein. <br>  <br>  It's a necessary mission. <br>  <br>  Saddam Hussein not only has weapons of mass destruction in development, he probably has some crude chemical, biological and nuclear bombs already in his arsenal. The threat this maniac poses is only going to get worse in the next 12 months as his mad scientists work overtime on plans to kill Americans, Jews, Europeans and Israelis. <br>  <br>  But this is a mission fraught with risk. <br>  <br>  This is the job that should have been finished during the first Persian Gulf War. It will be messier this time. We don't have the forces on the ground we had 10 years ago. Our full attention is diverted from Iraq as we still conduct military operations in Afghanistan. We don't have the support – real or hypothetical – of the rest of the Arab world as we did during the first campaign. <br>  <br>  There are likely to be heavy casualties as U.S. troops are forced to engage in close-up combat, searching palaces and underground bunkers for the factories that produce Hussein's weapons and the fortified warehouses where he stores them. <br>  <br>  This will not be a walk in the park. <br>  <br>  There is an excellent chance the war may come home for Americans, too. <br>  <br>  Some reports say Iraq and its terrorist allies have already made plans to detonate weapons of mass destruction in America and Europe as soon as the war begins. <br>  <br>  It may seem like we're damned if we do and damned if we don't. That is indeed the case. This is the tragic legacy left by indecision and multinational agreements a decade ago. But we must clean Iraq's clock now or the situation will get even worse in the next 12 to 24 months as Hussein develops deadlier weapons and the ability to deliver them more effectively and accurately. <br>  <br>  I have more often than not opposed American military adventures over the last decade. I believe they usually lacked focus, lacked constitutionality, lacked coherence, lacked perspective and lacked clean goals and objectives. <br>  <br>  I have explained over and over again how the U.S. has lost its very understanding of "defense" – giving over to the idea that it means projecting military power overseas rather than protecting the American people at home. <br>  <br>  I have specifically objected during the last decade to what seemed like pointless bombing missions in Iraq – designed, it seemed to me, for political impact in America more than military impact in Iraq. <br>  <br>  Despite all that, I believe America must attack Iraq. There is no choice. Saddam Hussein must go. We must finish the job, finally. There is no turning back. Time is not on our side. <br>  <br>  Here are some words of advice to our president as he contemplates these sobering plans: <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't worry about world opinion. It will come around if America is clear in its mission and resolute in carrying it out. <br>  <br>  Do concern yourself with congressional opinion. Like it or not, the Constitution is clear about Congress' war-making authority. That should be respected. In addition, if this campaign turns ugly, you will need Congress behind you 100 percent. Success has many parents. Failure is an orphan. <br>  <br>  Do not stop short of the objectives of destroying Saddam Hussein's regime, his war-making ability and his ability to produce weapons of mass destruction in the future. <br>  <br>  Do not politicize the war. Let the military men on the ground do what is necessary to win. Period. <br>  <br>  Call for a national day of prayer before the first shot is fired. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  <br>  Joseph Farah is founder, editor and CEO of WND and a nationally syndicated columnist with Creators Syndicate.

jnnIwdtyaa	Merry Meet,<br>  <br>  I hope the following helps out.<br>  <br>  01. Wicca is an oath-bound mystery religion, each Wiccan should either be Dedicated or Initiated as a Wiccan to be considered a Wiccan by their peers and/or the general Wiccan community.<br>  02. Wiccan’s are polytheistic, honoring a variety of gods and goddesses.<br>  03. Wiccan’s are also dualistic, seeing individual deities, at least to some extent, as aspects of one God and one Goddess.<br>  04. Wiccans are also pantheistic do some degree or another, viewing divinity as immanent within the natural world.<br>  05. Wicca encompasses the practice of magick even though many Wiccans don’t practice magick.<br>  06. Wiccan’s show religious devotion to the Goddess and/or God (depending upon Tradition).<br>  07. Wicca’s ethical basis is expressed in the Wiccan Rede ("An it harm none, do as ye will"), and the Threefold Law ("What ye send returns three times over").<br>  08. Wiccan Ritual usually involves casting a circle as the basic setting for spiritual and magical work, as well as emphasizes the Platonic four elements of earth, air, fire and water and some form of gender polarity, be that theologically in the image of the God and Goddess, and/or mundanely in the physical gender of participants as well.<br>  09. Wiccan’s more often than not incorporate some form of the "Great Rite" (union of the God and Goddess), frequently symbolized in the blessing of the ritual wine by the conjoining of the athame (ritual knife) and chalice (ritual wine cup).<br>  10. Wicca as it is known today with two cc’s came into being in the mid 1940’s, it was popularized in the mid 1960’s. But Wicca itself originates from Pre-Christian pagan belief system from all over Europe. Some (not all) Traditions in Wicca also incorporate the use of ceremonial magic, high magic and even Alchemistry which also predates Christianity<br>  <br>  Blessed Be<br>  <br>  Nyjh|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	Wicca dates back to 1939 when it was founded by Gerald Gardner as part of what is now called the Neo-Pagan movement, which is an attempt to reconstruct pre-Christian belief systems and adapt them to the modern world.  It is essentially a duo-theistic nature oriented faith based on personal responsibility and acceptance of responsibility for the consequences of ones own actions.  The life style is described by the Wiccan Rede, "Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill, So it harm none, do what thou will."  For a more detailed discussion I'd recommend you get a copy of "Wicca, a Guide for the Solitary Practitioner" by Scott Cunningham, it's the best introductory work I've found, and has good bibliography for further study.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	I find it really hard to believe that you can't find any books about what we believe.  Are you just reading spellbooks or something?<br>  <br>  First of all, you need to realize that there are no spontaneous thunder storms, no gusts of wind blowing in your face from out of ancient tomes, no waving your wand and making stuff happen.  If that's what you were thinking, you don't even need to read the rest of this.<br>  <br>  Read every book you can find about Wicca (that is written by a Wiccan) and you should never stop unless you lose interest in it.  I strongly recommend Christopher Penczak's Inner Temple of Witchcraft.  It's a great starter book because it starts at the beginning with building your own personal energy.  Also, it's not dramatic, so it easily weeds out anyone who thinks Wicca is an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  It takes hard work, time, and a lot of energy to become a witch in more than name.<br>  <br>  Unless you do harmful stuff with magick, it's not at all dangerous.  If you start cursing people, it is.  The energy you send out into the universe comes back to you.  Some say it comes back in equal measure, most say three times. If you curse someone, something three times as bad will happen to you.  That's really no different than the mundane world.  Live by the sword, die by the sword kind of thing.  Magick isn't supernatural.  It's working within the laws of nature to manifest one's will.  You can't break the natural laws, you can only learn ways to use them to help you that science has not yet discovered, but witches have through intuition and years of experimentation.  I think of it as similar to ancient humans using the power of fire for their benefit without having any idea where the fire really came from or why it exists.  They experimented with it until they could figure out just enough to use it to help their lives.<br>  <br>  Wiccans do not believe in hell or in an all evil deity like Satan.  We believe Satan is something humans invented so they had someone to blame when they did bad things.<br>  <br>  The only rule of Wicca is "Do what you want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone."  Wicca is about taking care of the earth and the people and animals in it, equality of the sexes, respecting that differences aren't bad (you will never meet a Wiccan homophobe), and that all paths to divinity (or none at all) are equally valid if they harm none.  We don't proselytize, only educate people when they ask.<br>  <br>  While there are classes for Wicca, they aren't necessary.  Everyone ultimately has to find the goddess and god within themselves.  Those classes charge money (just like yoga and exercise teachers) because they have to make a living.  But NEVER pay someone for online lessons.  Don't pay someone to do spells for you either.  Unless they only ask compensation for the supplies needed, they are a con-artist, as are spells sold over Ebay.<br>  <br>  Whatever your choice, I hope you find joy and peace.

To me it reiterates that we need to take responsibility in all things that we do-- consider how our actions affect other people/things/situations, and act responsibly; to take responsibility for our mistakes and make amends if possible. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  For me the observance of the seasons is the most powerfully moving and has the biggest impact on my life... in the cycle of the seasons, I see my mundane days, my journes, my entire life cycle.

It's a set of beliefs, with reasons for those beliefs.  Also, because there is no central authority in Wicca, there is a wide variety of beliefs commonly described as "Wiccan."

Wicca does not have a straight forward concept exactly. Mostly it is about honoring the Goddess and God, celebrating the turning of the wheel(the 8 wiccan sabbats) and treating everyone as equals. It is considered to be mostly a womens religion, but there are also many men followers. And my favorite part is the afterlife belief. This varies per person, personally I like the wiccan concept that after we die we can choose to be reincarnated and come back to this world, trying to make ourselfs better, until we are perfect and become part of the Goddess herself|`|Q0ZAY0Tyaa	Hello! i am a wiccan, and have been for a while,  (nearly 6 years, im 16 now)<br>  <br>   this may not asnwer the question very well but still<br>  i just want people to know that,<br>  <br>  Wiccans are NOT Devil worshipers!, wiccans dont belive in the devil. Wiccans and Pagans Are Not Satanists Ask any Pagan or Wiccan about the cornerstone of their faith, and they'll probably tell you it's a reverence for their ancestors, a belief in the sacredness of nature, a willingness to embrace the Divine within ourselves, or an acceptance of polarity between the male and female. It may be a combination of those principles.<br>  <br>   It will not have anything to do with the Satan, Old Scratch, Beelzebub, or any of the other names attributed to the Christian devil. Pagans and Wiccans aren't devil worshippers, Satanists, or Diabolists. go  Learn more about how Pagans and Wiccans feel about such an entity. <br>  <br>  if you want to be a wiccan thats fine but remeber its a religon. Not a fashin statment, it takes ALOT of studying and hard work,<br>  <br>  going around yelling "Hey everyone im a witch now." might not help you either..<br>  <br>  <br>  Wicca is not evil -- the vast majority of us hold to a life of peace. We do not summon demons, devils, or spirits (and I think that, at least in the first two cases, such attempts would be foolish and dangerous); instead, we celebrate the seasons as they turn, give thanks for the bounty that the gods have provided, <br>  <br>  The misconception that Wiccans are satanists began during the Roman Empire.<br>  <br>  Satan, the devil, Lucifer; whatever you call him is a Christian belief and has nothing to do with Wicca or its beliefs. Some satanists do use magic for power, but they are Satanists not Wiccans. A real Wiccan uses their power for protection, healing, good fortune, divination, etc. None of those are evil.

I think the best thing would be to keep the royal family, but keep all the power within the elected government.

Boudicca (Bod-Dig) translates from British (Celtic) to mean Victory (Victoria).<br>  <br>  Boudicca - British Warrior Queen<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8zL-lC_T-k" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8zL-lC_T...</a><br>  <br>  Boudicca stood up for Britain and took on the might of the Roman legions head on - destroying two of them completely and burning Londinium (London) to the ground.  She and her British Army had earlier destroyed the Roman garrison town of Colchester.<br>  <br>  We are a free people because of Royalty because while HM Queen is head of state of UK no despot or dictator can have that job.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Years ago, the Royals were simply the ones in history who won the wars, there were always benefits and downsides to having a Royal family.  If ever there was a war, they would lead you into it, with them at the front (I cannot see modern day royals doing that, we'd be cannon fodder whilst they ate swan pate in a diamond bunker - I am doubting that Harry was actually at the front line, would they really let him, I doubt it).  They would have a society built around them, the castle at the centre, with them in it, and you in a walled and raised village.  <br>  <br>  There were harsh laws, and although there was corruption, this kept your village within reason, crime free.<br>  <br>  The downsides, were corruption, taxation, and of course, some free services were expected for the royals, which to the little people in business, could be horrendous.<br>  <br>  Nowadays, our Royals are mainly a tourist attraction.  By which I'm not saying that they don't have "duties", but I do believe if most people were told they could make voluntary donations towards the royals, they'd have to sell up and move to a semi detached somewhere.<br>  <br>  As annoying as it is to me, one of the Queens "non subjects" (of course Londoners love her, she is right on their doorstep, bringing tourism to their area) in that I am in the North East, and very rarely do we get visits from Royals - I can imagine that a lot of tourism would stop if she wasn't there, with her feckless relatives, swanning about in their ivory tower.<br>  <br>  So, I suppose we do need them, but I cannot tell you how much I begrudge them the money!|`|02965963da3f0165b81bd488737cfad3aa	The Queen (or any reigning Monarch), symbolizes the continuity of the Nation over the arguments and vicissitudes of the politicians who attempt to govern us.<br>  <br>  The UK Monarch has no real power, but the symbolic power is immense.<br>  <br>  To the sceptics, I would say that, except for her immediate family and their offspring, the rest of them are a tad over-subsidized. I was dining in Gavroche in London  - a restaurant for which one has to book months in advance, and one of our minor Princesses walked in, without a reservation, and demanded her usual table. The poor old diner ended up sitting close to the entrance to the Gents- even the intervention of M Roux did no good. This type of behaviour is a bit over the top.|`|AA11366224	We have one because we chose to have one.  We tried military dictatorship under Cromwell senior and a brief spell of republic under Cromwell junior, but as soon as we got a say, we got the royals back.<br>  <br>  The present lot owe their status to Henry Tudor who usurped the throne following the Battle of Bosworth.  But don't bother reading the history books - he had them all rewritten.  We ran out of Tudors following Elizabeth I and had to import a King from Scotland - whose grandmother was Henry Tudor's daughter.  After Cromwell and the restoration, we fell out with the Scots and eventually got the Germans in (there was a female line back to the Scots).  And we've still got them.<br>  <br>  We have a monarchy for two reasons.  It works and it's cheap.  If we didn't have a monarchy, we'd have a politician in charge. Anyone who'd prefer President Blair to the Windsors doesn't deserve a vote.  Our monarchy costs a tiny fraction of the American presidency and about a fifth of the French presidency.  It's roughly the same as the cost of the Irish presidency - but with better value to the tourist trade.<br>  <br>  On a technicality, we actually make a profit on the monarchy.  The monarch owns the Crown Estates.  The income from them goes to the Treasury who then meet the cost of running the monarchy.  This arrangement dates back to George III.  We've been making a profit on the deal since Victoria's reign and the income from the Crown Estates subsidises our tax. If we got rid of the monarchy, they'd want the income from the Crown Estates back.  If you're thinking they should be confiscated - do you really want to give the government power to impose a 100% wealth tax? You could be next.<br>  <br>  You obviously know little about them.  Don't believe everything you read in the Murdoch Press or on Fox News.  The great benefit of a monarchy is that the Queen has power to sack a Prime Minister.  A few decades ago, she sacked Murdoch's puppet Australian Prime Minister Goff Whitlam.  Slimy Rupert has been trying to get back at her ever since.|`|TPVvddHWaa	This is an age old question<br>  <br>  OK we do have a load of titled people who seem to be sponging on us.<br>  <br>  What I will tell you is.<br>  <br>  Charities.

They get far more money.<br>  <br>  Business When they want trade, they want a Royal, it is brilliant for business, especially from abroad.<br>  <br>  Tourists. When we get tourists. The first thing they want to see are our palaces, our castles and best of all, to see where a royal lives.<br>  <br>  Royal visits.<br>  <br>  As soon as it is known that a Royal will attend. Every one wants to be there.<br>  <br>  The alternative is a President. For years statistics have given figures around the world to show the cost.<br>  <br>  The British Royal family has consistantly come out above Presidents for costs and because we have several members to be in more than one place at the same time. It is in fact less costly and more advantageous to have Royalty than a President.<br>  <br>  Our Queen Elizabeth, dedicated her life to her people and years after she could have retired as an ordinary citizen (and still received all her privilledges) she has continued to work. As has her husband.<br>  <br>  You will never get that dedication from a President.<br>  <br>  I am a value for money person and it is my belief that Royalty, provides that.<br>  <br>  I am also a socialist and can certainly say that our Royal Family care more for the people than many countries Presidents.<br>  <br>  We were once without a monarch. Oliver Cromwell and his followers tried to get rid of Royalty. They failed and the monarch was invited back..<br>  <br>  Last centuary in Spain the Royal Family were deposed by General Franco. Upon his death, Royalty was invited back.<br>  <br>  People love pomp and ceremony and adore meeting some one 'superior'.<br>  <br>  God Save Our Queen|`|3uGcqN2Eaa	It's a mystery to me!!!

Each year, I wonder if I'm getting too old for riding, but each year I ride, and I don't care if I look like an old fart on a bike.

I like save my money for  travel, and hope to even more in the next decade.

I think the last time I played bingo was at some church function and I wasn't paying much attention and kept missing the number announcement.  Walked through a casino once when the family drove cross country about 45 years ago.  Have no idea what the Chicken dance is.  I love smogies but there aren't any close-by that I know of.  Have never had surgery (knock wood).  And hate chachkahs which are just dust collectors.  What today's seniors do with their time has changed.|`|nwnILcEAaa	I play bingo online for fun and think the Chicken Dance is great fun, but don't do it anymore, would not keep Precious Moments figurines and do discuss medical issues with family and friends who have similar ailments.

AA11849917	"for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, that no man should glory."  (Eph 2:8-9)<br>  <br>  The Old Testament prophets said we need to Repent!  John the Baptizer said we need to Repent!  Paul in his letters said that we need to Repent!  Jesus said, "Go and sin no more"  (i.e. "Repent!")<br>  <br>  But does repentance earn us salvation?<br>  <br>  We need to remember that we are sinners "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."<br>  <br>  God is offering us an undeserved and unmerited pardon because of the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ to pay the penalty for our sins.  (Jesus said "I did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give my life a ransom.")<br>  <br>  But when the Scriptures say that we need to repent, does that mean we have "earned" anything?<br>  <br>  No, for we are saved by grace, through faith, not of works, lest any man boast!<br>  <br>  So, what IS "repentance"?  It is a condition, that without which, God can not morally grant us a pardon.  <br>  <br>  The repentance doesn't earn us a pardon, because we are already guilty before God, and NOTHING we do can change that.  <br>  <br>  We deserve the punishment, period.  "but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead through our trespasses, quickened us together with Christ (by grace have ye been saved), and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus: that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus: for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, that no man should glory."  (Eph 2:4-9)<br>  <br>  So, repentance (i.e. works) doesn't gain us salvation.  But without repentance, it BLOCKS salvation.<br>  <br>  There is absolutely NOTHING a guilty person can do, but fall on the mercy of the court.  Fortunately for us, the Judge is willing.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I took a look at it.  Perhaps you should look at the source, the bible, which teaches us it is by grace we are saved, through faith; not by works that any man should boast.|`|0fd6c9cd983b835b83ca7be549d67540aa	i still believe one must be saved by God's grace and your faith before the works come. you do the works cuz you love God and want to please Him not cuz your trying to keep your "salvation". if im doing works cuz i think it has to do with my salvation then im trying to earn my way and that's false thinking. ppl are being brainwashed to believe they must do something to keep their salvation and i dont agree with it. my aunt as this belief. i used to believe this way myself and it gave satan great opportunities to give me condemnation. then i finally realized this isn't how it should be.|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	Of course "believing" isn't forgiveness nor salvation.  Even Satan "believes" in Jesus.  Salvation is "confessing and accepting" Jesus as the Son of God.  I read some of that page (it was really really long) and with what I read I agree with you.  That's why we as Christians must strive to constantly allow ourselves to be taught by the Holy Spirit and continue to become "new creations" in Christ Jesus.  Believing and faith are two different things.  Faith and accepting Jesus are also different.  I pray you continue learning the truth as you seek Jesus.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Esther is absolutely correct - God bless you.|`|263c7d9b97af1cafe7ffc2587fb2a69aaa	When we say we are saved by faith alone we are referring to what we can do.  We are not saying that only faith is necessary for salvation.  After all, Jesus died so that we could be saved; therefore, His sacrifice is also required for salvation.  Also James correctly points out that faith without works is dead.  Since God demands perfection, imperfect works will not make our faith alive; perfect works are required.  When God the Son (Jesus) was born as a human, He kept God's laws perfectly; including showing reverence and servitude to God the Father which many mistake for evidence that Jesus was less than God.  Even though Jesus was perfect, God forsook Him and Jesus suffered death.  Why did God forsake Jesus if He was perfect?  Because my works were attributed to Him and the works of all others who lived or will live.  These works were imperfect and the penalty was death and being forsook by God, which Jesus suffered on the cross.  But if my works were attributed to Him, what happened to His perfect works?  They are attributed unto me and to anyone else who will place their faith in Him alone.  Therefore, for our part, we are saved by faith alone; but the price of our salvation was indeed much greater than faith alone, such that we could not afford to pay it.|`|IMSkR8Ajaa	No, it doesn't. (Edit: I wholeheartedly agree with supercop13x above) <br>  <br>  Just reading the first few paragraphs of this, I can already spot several things wrong with this person's conclusions and statements.<br>  <br>  First, let me make it very clear that salvation is by grace through faith. If it was not for the grace of God sending His Son Jesus Christ to die for our sins, we would be lost for all eternity. By placing our faith in Christ and His finished work on the cross, we are saved. No other way.<br>  <br>  Having said that,<br>  1) "No Passage Says We Are Saved by Faith Alone"<br>  I beg to differ. Notice Ephesians 2:7-9 which says: <br>  Eph 2:7 "That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in [his] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus." <br>  Eph 2:8 "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God:"<br>  Eph 2:9 "Not of works, lest any man should boast." <br>  <br>  "and that not of yourselves..." Nothing we can do can save us except placing faith in Christ.<br>  <br>  Notice Romans 11:6 which says "And if by grace, then [is it] no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if [it be] of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work."<br>  <br>  This verse tells us that if we add works to the grace of God, then it is no more grace. So, you can not believe in salvation by grace through faith and works!!!! It is against the Bible.<br>  <br>  2) Mr. Pratte actually uses Acts 2:47, 20:28; Ephesians 5:23,25 as verses proving that church membership is required for salvation!! This is so far off the mark, it is pitiful. To say that we can take this from these verses is absolutely false and just ignorant of their meaning! <br>  <br>  I do not mean to offend anyone, but to say that some of the other things that this man has listed (baptism, church membership, etc) are necessary for salvation is just wrong. While I agree that salvation is by grace through faith, I do not believe that it is by anything else.
l8c2kTlvaa	Of course I wouldn't - my dogs just to cute, I wouldn't be able to!|`|aYVVwjBXaa	yes i would. i could not bear to watch him suffer the pain of starving to death so i would kill him. after he is already dead it would be selfish of me not to eat him because my family would be pissed if i didn't try everything possible to survive until a rescue (if one came). although he doesn't really have any meat on him either, but hypothetically, yes i would.|`|K1dqsTKoaa	No! My cat is chubby [well, obese, apparently]... but, I still wouldn't eat him. He's my pet, I would never think of him as food.<br>  I would find enough food for the both of us.

But if you really get desperate, and it comes down your life or your pets life, then obviously eat it, because your life is more important than a pet. Human life is not equal to animal life - it is superior. This does not mean that we should exploit or mistreat animals (by all means we should care for them), but we are not equally valuable.

AA12203324	Not so much condoning as tolerating and avoiding trouble.  It is not unusual for a faith to be most concerned with the wellfare of its own members before that of others.  Hence, the Vatican during World War II advised the (Catholic) Christian Democrats not to speak up too loudly against the Reich to avoid persecution.  And it showed far more concern for Croatian Catholics than for Serbian Orthodox or Bosnian Muslims, despite evidence of Croatian atrocities.  Religious leaders sometimes ignore their prophetic call out of an instinctive desire to protect their followers from retaliation.  In this way, they may act spiritually less mature than some of their bolder members.  We are all responsible for our own moral progress, but it is daunting, and even moreso to be responsible for someone else's.  There were Catholics who kept their heads down, and there were Catholics (such as Angelo Roncalli, the future John XXIII) who did all they could to hide and free Jews from the grip of the Axis.|`|kdo6qnS9aa	The catholic cult helped hundreds of Nazis escape Europe after the end of WWII.

Also some members of the Catholic church even helped nazis escape to south America when they should have been hung with the rest of them!!! <br>  <br>  But there were many Catholics who helped Jewish people hide during the Holocaust and what they did to save peoples lives shouldn't be forgotten.

AA11440601	You have a bit of unlearning to do.<br>  <br>  Only a small part of the Bible dates back to the Bronze Age.<br>  <br>  While we do believe that the Bible is inspired by God, we also interpret it very critically.<br>  <br>  We are especially attentive "to the content and unity of the whole Scripture." We read the Scripture within "the living Tradition of the whole Church" and we are attentive to the analogy of faith.<br>  <br>  We look at different senses of Scripture<br>  + The literal sense<br>  + The spiritual sense<br>  + The allegorical sense<br>  + The moral sense<br>  + The anagogical sense<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 105 and following: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1sect1chpt2.shtml#104" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I've read most of Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle -- and they all predate the NT by centuries.

Ignoring spelling-oriented (orthographic) changes and similar small differences, the Dead Sea Scrolls match the Hebrew text behind today’s Old Testament, in spite of the passage of over 2,000 years (where one would expect errors to creep in).<br>  <br>  The New Testament’s earliest manuscripts date from 25-50 years after composition, and there are about 5700 extant manuscripts. Compare this with Thucydides, which only has 20 known manuscripts, the earliest of which is 1300 years removed from the original. Or Homer’s Iliad, 500 years removed from the original. The New Testament is the most reliable document of antiquity (a document written before the printing press). <br>  <br>  <br>  Of course, I'm sure you already knew that.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Well I actually studied a lot of ancient history so the list will be quite long. <br>  <br>  Incidentally you are incorrect in saying the Bible is a product of the "Bronze Age". The Bronze Age  primarily took place between 3500 BC and 1200 BC, and is traditionally divided into the Early Bronze Age (c.3500-2000 BC), Middle Bronze Age (c.2000-1600 BC), and Late Bronze Age (c.1600-1200 BC), with progressively more sophisticated metallurgy which culminates in the discovery of ironworking. Each of the books of the Bible were written in different places and at different times, and by my sources ( <a href="http://www.carm.org/christianity/bible/when-was-bible-written-and-who-wrote-it" rel="nofollow">http://www.carm.org/christianity/bible/w...</a> ) technically only Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, and Judges would qualify as "Bronze Age"...but I can tell you are trying to be clever, so I'll let that slide.<br>  <br>  Archeologists have a great deal of faith in many records they have found that date to the period. I don't think any could be called "literary" (with the exceptions of the Epic of Gilgamesh and the works of Homer), most are "  heavy on the recording of animal sales and grain purchases" but there are plenty of records found <a href="http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/05/06_tablet.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/...</a> that archeologists find to be invaluable.<br>  And lets not forget that it was Heinrich Schliemann's blind faith in Homer that led him to find the ruins of the actual Troy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Schliemann" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Sc...</a><br>  <br>  However, to get back to your question, the Bible wasn't complete till the 4th or 5th Century, so again your attempt to ridicule the Bible as a "bronze age book" comes up a bit short. In fact the African Synod of Hippo, in 393, approved the New Testament, as it stands today, together with the Septuagint books, a decision that was repeated by Councils of Carthage in 397 and 419. These councils were under the authority of St. Augustine, who regarded the canon as already closed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_ca...</a> <br>  <br>  This would make pretty much anything and everything written in the Ancient World contemporary to the Bible, if not older. (Cesar's Gallic Wars for example were written long before any of the Gospels, what with him dying in 44 B.C. and all.  I'm assuming you believe that Julus Cesar existed.)<br>  <br>  So to answer your question  I would have to list most of the works of Aristotle here, and much of Plato, Arran's Campaigns of Alexander, Xenophon's Anabisis, Thucydides's The Peloponesian War, as well as the works of Cicero, Appian, Suetonius, Plutarch, and a good many other works as well, including Marcus Arelius' Meditations.<br>  <br>  Have you read any of them?

It is amazing that so much has survived, and a shame that so much has been lost, accidentally or on purpose. <br>  <br>  Older writings have been found form many middle eastern civilisations, such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, Hittites,  Minoan and from other places as well. But none of these are well known or easily accessible. <br>  <br>  The Bible is great as a rough guide to the history of the Jewish peoples and as a testament to a religious viewpoint.

You don't want to hear what the Bible says but you want an answer from God on this matter...?<br>  <br>  Homosexuality has never been proven to be genetic, please do not state a hypothesis as a fact when it is not at all proven empirically by the scientific method.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is not natural, that it occurs at all in nature does in no way mean that it is natural and right. Biologically speaking, if homosexuality were the norm, any species practicing homosexuality as a common means of pairing, that species would inevitably die out due to the lack of procreation that bears viable offspring. Most animals only "couple" in order to procreate and the coupling is largely seasonal, or when the animal is in heat. This is common in nature. They fertilize and go on their way. If they couple with the same sex, there is no offspring that results, meaning less of that species exponentially until there are none left. This means that homosexuality is, even in nature an anomaly, a flaw, a non-desirable trait. Undesirable traits in nature are weeded out by the pack or herd.<br>  <br>  If homosexuality were genetic, (not proven) but for the sake of the hypothetical argument that it is, if it were, then it would fall under the same categorization as any number of genetic flaws. This entire creation is corrupted by sin, which is the cause for disease, mutation and ultimately death. Homosexuality does not produce viable offspring, it does not benefit the family group, it is dangerous and harmful to the body. The human body was created specifically male and female with adjoining parts that work in unison to create life. It is not natural for a male to be with a male, or a female with a female.<br>  <br>  Denying reality is fantasy, and the reality is that men and women are made for each other, just as male and female animals are made for each other. No act of human will is ever going to change that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <<*Edit: if everything I said is wrong as you said, and I quote, "Wow what a lump of BS there. Everything you said is flat out wrong." <br>  <br>  Why don't you explain just how I am wrong in "anything" I have said to you?>><br>  <br>  <br>  <<*Edit: Your quote: "btw people being gay...doesn't affect my liking women. Does it make you gay if someone else is? That is unnatural and fantasy....denying homosexuality occurs naturally is denying reality. And last I checked no one was trying to make it the normal mode of society or procreation......just to be treatd as human. "<br>  <br>  Where did I even imply that homosexuality was a transmitted disease whereby a heterosexual person can be "made" gay because a gay person somehow infected them? You should read my response again very carefully before reacting emotionally.<br>  <br>  And also, I did not ever say that homosexual behavior never occurs in nature, I said when it does occur in nature it is not normal, it is an abnormal occurrence.>><br>  <br>  I am not trying to provoke you, but you make these statements in the hopes of justifying your view and don't back them with anything but emotion. You say you want to hear God's word on the matter, but you won't even listen to His word now, so what good will that do.<br>  <br>  Treating people with love and respect is what all Christians are called to do, but we do not have any commandment that tells us we need to condone wrong action or just be tolerant of a "movement" that is attacking all things Holy and Right in order to make itself acceptable as if it were somehow a new class of people who need protection from the hordes of evil Christians who don't want marriage and the freedom of religion re-defined by a small number of individuals who want to have sex with anyone they desire and want it to be the societal norm. <br>  <br>  I treat my friends who happen to be homosexual with love because I love them and I am honest with them about my faith and about homosexuality, but that will never mean that I am going to lie to them and say that homosexuality is just hunky dory because it will make them feel better for a few minutes. That would be hating them, to lie to them and essentially just say, "it's ok, I don't mind if you go to hell because you choose to reject God's word about same sex relations." I will never do that because I love them.|`|886385e2d42a76f8ca41eba535a9a3b2aa	God makes people who are heterosexual also, and it is just as much a sin for *them* to be sexually active outside the Sacrament of Marriage.  The sin is not being gay - as you say that's not something that one chooses.  The sin is in *choosing* to be sexually active and indulging in an expression of intimacy that, in Christian theology, is reserved for Sacramentally married couples.  If you disagree with that position, then Christian life is probably not for you.  Simple as that.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, the *love* part of "gay love" is not a problem either.

Amen.<br>  <br>  26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: 27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.<br>  <br>  28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; 29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: 32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.

Hence there is a much greater chance of being homosexual if you are the youngest brother of two older brothers. But the cause is still pretty much just a theory.<br>  <br>  And yes, yes yes, there is a growing body of research to suggest that genetics plays an overwhelming factor (e.g., chromosome Xq28 in males ).<br>  <br>  In other words, there is good and growing evidence to suggest you are born that way and little  evidence to suggest that you have any control over it or at least about your emotional reactions.<br>  <br>  But human are quite malleable.

In fact, quite the contrary; homosexuality isn't immoral - it hurts nobody. Homophobia hurts and sometimes kills - that's what's immoral.<br>  <br>  Christians can't reconcile the idea of a fair god with those barbaric laws, so they have to pretend that homosexuality is an immoral act (it isn't), a choice (it isn't - if you think it is, can you tell me about when you made the choice?), and unnatural (it's not - it's observed in many animal species).<br>  <br>  You could argue that in today's overpopulated world, heterosexuality should be the 'sin'.<br>  <br>  P.S.

Would You Know For Sure, Without A Doubt, That You Would Go Heaven? <br>  <br>  May I tell you my story?<br>  <br>  My story relates to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Who is this Jesus?<br>  <br>  We can know how to have eternal life!<br>  1 John 5:13 These things have I written unto you, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, [even] unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God. <br>  <br>  There was a time in my life when I was confused, because of all the different churches out there. Which one do I believe, because they all teach different things?<br>  <br>  Just because I was raised by my parents to believe certain things does that make everyone else wrong? No.<br>  I got to thinking in life there are life and death statements.<br>  For instance let's say your house catches on fire. Someone comes up in the middle of the night and raps on the window and shouts "get out of the house, the house is on fire." Well you know you wouldn't need an interpreter or call a few friends over and ask them what it means when someone says your house is on fire. No you wouldn't do that it is so clear what you should do. You understand you simply have to act on it and get out of the house. Well I got to thinking the Bible talks about there being an everlasting punishment. I believe this is Gods word. I thought God must have some life and death statements. Like get out of the house the house is on fire. Does God have some statements like believe this and you will live do this and you will die? He does. <br>  <br>  Then, what has been written? <br>  <br>  John 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.<br>  <br>  Well I know what that means. Unless I believe that Jesus is who he says he is I will die in my sins.<br>  <br>  Isn't this a life and death statement?<br>  <br>  Then who is this Jesus? <br>  <br>  Let's go exploring. <br>  <br>  Matthew 16:13-17 Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of man is? 14 And they said, Some [say] John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. 15 He saith unto them, But who say ye that I am? 16 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. 17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven. <br>  <br>  Whose son is he? "God's son"<br>  In other words Jesus says you are right.<br>  <br>  Well you know I got to thinking what does it mean to believe he is the son of God? So I kept reading.<br>  <br>  Is he being the son of God all we must believe concerning His identity? <br>  <br>  John 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br>  <br>  And I kept reading.   <br>  <br>  Just being the son of God...Is God. Notice here: <br>  John 1:14 And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth. <br>  <br>  Well here Jesus is claiming to be the son of God and God at the same time. <br>  <br>  All Jesus is saying is that he is the same as his parents. Jesus mother was human and father was God. That makes him 100% human and 100% God.<br>  <br>  Is that important that Jesus is a 100% God and man? Remember John 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.<br>  <br>  When Jesus came to earth, did he leave his Godhead in Heaven? <br>  <br>  Colossians 2:9 for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily, <br>  Notice that Jesus is 100% man and 100% God.  <br>  <br>  Here God the Father calls his own son God.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 1:1, 8 God, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners, <br>  8 but of the Son [he saith], Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; And the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. <br>  <br>  Quote above taken from Psalm 45:6<br>  <br>  I remember back when God was talking to Moses through the burning bush in Exodus 3:14-15 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. 15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. <br>  <br>  I noticed Jesus using that same name. <br>  <br>  Who does Jesus claim to be?  <br>  <br>  Jesus claims to be the great "I Am"<br>  <br>  John 8:58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am. <br>  <br>  I remebered John 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.<br>  <br>  People all over the country say Jesus is different things. Some say he is the brother of Satan. Or Jesus is Michael the Ark Angel. There's even another religious group called Islam that dominates the world. Mohammed says Jesus was a man and the greatest prophet that ever lived. That's all he is.<br>  <br>  Jesus though say's John 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.<br>  <br>  Jesus is saying what you see standing before you is a man, but you must look closer with the eye of faith and see standing here is Jehovah your God.<br>  <br>  So, we must believe Jesus is God, or we will die in our sins. <br>  <br>  I did discover that he is one of three "persons" in the Godhead.<br>  <br>  Matthew 3:16,17 And Jesus when he was baptized, went up straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him; 17 and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. <br>  <br>  Well I kept reading to find out more about this Jesus.<br>  <br>  What he did and why?<br>  <br>  And Jesus is one of them.<br>  Let's look and see what Jesus is called here.<br>  1 Timothy 2:5 For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, [himself] man, Christ Jesus, <br>  <br>  I thought I know what a mediator is, that's a go between. Sort of like a bridge. A bridge is a bridge because it touches two shores. Because Jesus is God he touches God shore because he is human he touches our shore. So no wonder he is my one and only way home.  <br>  <br>  Why do we need a mediator? <br>  <br>  You know I was reading in the Old Testament one day and came across<br>  Isaiah 59:2 but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, so that he will not hear. <br>  <br>  Well then it donned on me no wonder Jesus is the mediator. God wants me home with him but, I have been separated from God because of my sins. Jesus has got to bridge me back to God.<br>  <br>  What has separated us from God?<br>  <br>  Psalm 92:15 To show that Jehovah is upright; He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him. <br>   <br>  I came across Romans 3:10 as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one; <br>  <br>  Habku 1:13 Thou that art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness, wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he; <br>  <br>  If I am unrighteous he can't even look at me?  So here's the predicament what has he got to do to save me? <br>  <br>  What can save us? <br>  <br>  What is the power of God to save us?<br>  <br>  I came across Romans 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. <br>  <br>  You know there's that word salvation, it must be a life and death statement. I found that any time you come across a verse that has words like "life, death, heaven, hell, lost, salvation, and saved." Those are your salvation verses.<br>  <br>  Well this has the word salvation in it. The gospel is God's power of to save me.<br>  <br>  I went exploring to find out what this gospel is.<br>  <br>  What is the gospel of Christ? <br>  <br>  You know I have found that the Bible interprets itself. In many places it mentions the gospel. <br>  <br>  One of the clearest is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 Now I make known unto you brethren, the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand, 2 by which also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the word which I preached unto you, except ye believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;<br>  <br>  So the gospel  must consist of this Godman's death,  that's Jesus' death , burial, and resurrection. <br>  <br>  Well I heard that before. How do those events take care of my salvation?  Why did Jesus have to die on that cross? Let's  break it down. We have seen that we have a sin problem. <br>  <br>  I found in 1 John 3:4 Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.  <br>  <br>  Sin is the breaking of God's law. As a baby I was over here and had never sinned. One day I decided to cross that line and commit sin. When I did wrong I decided to do wrong. I stepped away from the right I have been separated from God. I broke his moral law of righteousness. <br>  <br>  In my life I have gotten a few traffic tickets because I broke the law. I realized that you break the law you have to pay the fine.  That is what is called due process. I broke the law so I get what is due to me. Does God have a due process? I kept reading. <br>  <br>  The Bible says in Roman 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>  <br>  Death? God is the source of life. If I sin I step away from life.  The wages of sin is death, but if we keep reading we see the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus. In other words God is saying I don't want you to pay that penalty, I will pay it for you. Well what is it going to cost God to pay it for us? The wages of sin is death. Human sins human dies. So God had to become human and die that human death in order to pay for that human death. That's why Jesus is God and human. He is the Godman. He had to become human to die that human death, to pay for my human sin. What sacrifice what kind of love must God really have for me and you?  <br>  <br>  The Bible says Hebrews 10:8  Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein (the which are offered according to the law), So the Hebrew writter says in 10:4,5 For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. 5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, But a body didst thou prepare for me; <br>  <br>  Why did Jesus have to do each of these things to save us? <br>  <br>  In his death we reach his blood.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 1:7 in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, <br>  <br>  Paul says we are saved by grace through Christ Jesus.<br>  <br>  Well that's why Jesus died on the cross to take away my sin problem. <br>  <br>  How wonderful is this forgiveness? <br>  <br>  Jude 1:24 Now him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory without blemish in exceeding joy, <br>  <br>   He can present us how?<br>  Faultless he can makes me as clean as the day I was born. All my sins are washed away by Jesus Christ. You see not one sin can enter into Heaven. Remember Habku 1:13 Not one sin can enter Heaven. I want in on that don't you? I got to thinking, why did Jesus have to come out of the grave?  Now I read John 20:30, 31 Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book: 31 but these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in his name. <br>  <br>  Jesus takes care of our sin problem with his death. Now why was he raised for us? <br>  <br>  Watch how Jesus takes care of our grave problem.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 15:20-23  But now hath Christ been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep. 21 For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead. 22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. 23 But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; then they that are Christ's, at his coming. <br>  <br>  Because of Adams sin we all must die. As I kept reading 1 Corinthians 15:42,53 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:  53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. <br>  <br>  But Jesus delivers us from the grave. <br>  <br>  In a nutshell, what two things does the gospel bring us? <br>  <br>  2 Timothy 1:10 but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, <br>  <br>  We get life because of Jesus death. We get immortality because of his resurrection. <br>  Paul says it another way. <br>  <br>  What can we be through Jesus death?<br>  What can we be through his life?<br>  <br>  Romans 5:10 For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life;  <br>  <br>  Reconciled, what does that mean? I looked it up. It means to be made friends again. So we were made friends again through the death of Jesus. What is the due process of sin? Death, Jesus died to take away my sin problem. <br>  <br>  1 Thes 5:23 And the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  I have discovered there are only two things that keep us out of Heaven, sin and the grave. Jesus takes care of them in his death and resurrection. I want in on that don't you?<br>  <br>  Do you see the gospel here? How do we get "into his death"?<br>  <br>  How do I get in on it?<br>  <br>  Romans 10:9 because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus [as] Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved:  <br>  <br>  Raised him from the dead. That's the gospel.  Must we confess Christ and believe the gospel to be saved? Is this a life and death statement?<br>  <br>  Must we change our lifestyles? <br>  <br>  Ephesians 4:17 This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind, <br>  <br>  Ephsians 5:7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them; <br>  <br>  Galatians 5:19-26  My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you-- 20 but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you. 21 Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? 22 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman. 23 Howbeit the [son] by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the [son] by the freewoman [is born] through promise. 24 Which things contain an allegory: for these [women] are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar. 25 Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children. 26 But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother. <br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:9,10 Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, 10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. <br>  <br>  We need to talk about that.<br>  Fornicators those having sexual relations outside of marriage. <br>  Idolaters anything you put before God. The Bible says 18 times to love the Lord your God with all your heart. <br>  Adultery relationships with others than your spouse. <br>  On down the list. <br>  Repentance means to change your ways. Are these life and death statements? Do this and you will live do this and you will die. <br>  <br>  What if we do not change? <br>  <br>  Are these life and death statements?<br>  <br>  Luke 13:3, 5  “I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.” 5  “I tell you, no; but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.”<br>  <br>  To get the saving gospel what must we do? <br>  <br>  What must we do to escape God's vengeance and everlasting destruction?<br>  <br>  2 Thes 1:8,9 rendering vengeance to them that know not God, and to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus: 9 who shall suffer punishment, [even] eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might, <br>  <br>  How do we humans “obey the gospel?” <br>  <br>  Well you know I have to come to know God and obey the gospel to avoid destruction.<br>  <br>  How can I obey the gospel? That didn't make sense to me , until I kept  reading the Bible. I found out the bible just keeps interpreting itself over and over again.<br>  <br>  Do you see the gospel here? How do we get “into his death?”<br>  <br>  I came across Romans 6:3 Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? 4 We were buried therefore with him through baptism unto death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life. <br>  <br>  Baptized into his death now that began to make sense to me. Why would Jesus want me to get into his death? Well, that's were Jesus blood was shed for the forgiveness of my sins. It's into the water into his death that forgives me of my sins. Can I just put just a little water or make a wet cross on my forehead? No I must be buried with him in baptism. We have to go under the water in order to be buried with him. Now I have found how to obey the gospel.<br>  <br>   I read over there in 1 Thes 2:8,9 rendering vengeance to them that know not God, and to them that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus: 9 who shall suffer punishment, [even] eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might, <br>  <br>  <br>  Romans 6:17, 18 But thanks be to God, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered; 18 and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness. <br>  <br>  Why would God want us to get "into his death"? Ephsians 1:7 <br>  <br>  I am baptized into the gospel of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Where does one actually become a Christian?<br>  <br>   I came across Galatians 3:26,27 For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.<br>  <br>  Well no wonder that makes sense. Once I  put on Christ in baptism his blood washes away my sins. Once I am baptized I become a Christian. Not before, but in that exact moment that I am baptised I am added to his Church. <br>  <br>  Later on I discovered Ephsians 1:22-23 And he put all things under his feet and gave him to be head over all things to the Church, which is his body. The fullness of him who fills all in all<br>  <br>  Ephesians 4:4,5 There is one body and one spirit. Just as you were called in one hope of your calling; one lord one faith, one baptism;<br>  <br>  The Church is the body of Christ. And there is only one body. So if I am in Christ I am in the body. I am in the body with the rest of those that have done the same thing. Man I wanted to do that, but I thought, you know if I do that there are going to be some tough times coming. <br>  <br>  If one becomes a Christian will he face persecution? <br>  <br>  <br>  What will It Cost?<br>  <br>  I keep reading John 15:20 Remember the word that I said unto you, A servant is not greater than his lord. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also. <br>  <br>  You know I wonder where that persecutions going to come from? I found out it's from the family.<br>  <br>  What is the worst kind of persecution? <br>  <br>  Luke 14:26, 28 If any man cometh unto me, and hateth not his own father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. 28 For which of you, desiring to build a tower, doth not first sit down and count the cost, whether he have [wherewith] to complete it? <br>  <br>  To count the cost :<br>  <br>  We see here that Jesus commands commitment:<br>  2 Peter 2:20,21 For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is become worse with them than the first. 21 For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them.  <br>  <br>  Lord I want to go to Heaven. Lord I am going to walk the walk I am going to face the persecution. I am going to do it. <br>  <br>  You know every time in the book of Acts when someone is baptized it is always immediately. I mean no exception. What is this that we do today in so many places around the country and world?  Where we wait a week or two weeks or every month? Or we have a baptismal participation ceremony every year.  I have heard that.  Every time in the Bible it is immediate. Why? Because you can not be saved outside the blood of Jesus. <br>  Baptism is where you go to the water. And it's into the water into death and into the blood of Christ. You can not be saved outside the blood of Jesus. What is this sinners prayer business? That is not even found in the Bible. What is found in the Bible is you have to obey the gospel. Well what is the gospel? It is the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. How do we obey the gospel? How do we reenact the gospel?  By being baptized into his death, buried with him through baptism. <br>  <br>  Remember Romans 6:4  We were buried therefore with him through baptism unto death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life.  We have to go to deep water to be buried. I want to ask would you read Acts 22:16 and give God your answer.<br>  <br>  Please read these words and give God your answer:<br>  <br>  Acts 22:16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his name.<br>  <br>  www.gbntv.org|`|5cf3b0dee6286a6a2eeb2709c9e22579aa	I LOVE THE HOUSE!!!!

7z1Mfcdqaa	I think they"re both... kind of. I would say heaven or hell are more states of being than states of mind. I personally have a great deal of faith that there places beside this earthly realm. These other realms are our destinies. I think earth is filled with the hot cold, and the lukewarm. When we die the chaff is separated from the wheat and oh boy are some people going to be hot then.<br>    I bet if one were to believe holy people truly exist, and if one were so inclined anyone could find a holy person.

I think there is indeed heaven and hell based on my beliefs.|`|PqBYGv1vaa	No way Jose. Jesus is very specific about Hell and Heaven being places. He describes each believer having mansions up there and there being thrones for the original eleven disciples and us judging angels and living in New Jerusalem with God forever, face to face, with no moon and no sun, etc. He also describes hell as a real place, being the destination for Satan and his demons and what happens to people who are there and so on. When Jesus ascended into the sky and went on to Heaven in Acts, it is not recorded that He disappeared into His mind - rather in the Gospels and in Acts it is recorded that He went to Heaven and sat down in the place of honor at God's right hand.<br>  From all this there is no possible way these places could be figurative. God is going to destroy all heaven and all earth and make new ones, a la Revelation, and Isaiah too.<br>  It's going to be awesome!|`|qnaGMFAGaa	I am quite impressed by the answer of  '1 Cor 14 34-35'|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	Perhaps a more scientific description would be 'dimensions'.|`|yPy4gFZ9aa	there is no god or heaven|`|36ff857df7ec751866efe603f8e9b6aaaa	Yes, I have thought about it.

And, I accept what the Bible says over what my feeble mind thinks.<br>  <br>  The "state of consciousness" you are referring to is a "New Age" concept.

But the "while you're alive" part is a problem.  Essentially, heaven and hell have to be externally imposed AND just or they don't make sense.  Yet, a great many virtuous people suffer throughout their lives, while a great many evil people die old and happy.  In fact, that's one of the primary reasons why the idea of an afterlife developed, to verify the existence of divine justice in an unjust world.  If "heaven" and "hell" are being experienced now, they aren't being distributed very sensibly.|`|2nqmoerIaa	u bet man<br>  <br>  <br>  Dom K|`|de25107f3b25bf271852feb4203decd7aa	Not really. I always thought they were real places. It seems pretty unfair that in a life - if somebody were an evil person on earth and treated people like dogs their entire life that they would get the sweet deal of just dying and that was it. There are consequences and rewards for everything that you do in this life. That's just the way I was raised.

They are very real places.<br>  <br>  This response is somewhat lengthy, but I hope you read it in its entirety. In addition to answering your direct question, I've also addressed some obvious underlying questions or thoughts which I am certain is relevant to your question, or questions that my response would surely raise up in your mind. So please forgive my verbose response.<br>  <br>  Heaven<br>  -----------<br>  Heaven is in space. Exactly *where* in space, we are not told. (Revelation 21:2; 1 Kings 8:28-30)<br>  <br>  In the Bible, the word "heaven" refers to 3 different places. Perhaps you've heard the expression "the third heaven" (2 Corinthians 12:2).<br>  <br>  The word "heaven" is used in places to refer to earths atmosphere ("saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven..." - Revelation 19:17).<br>  <br>  Another use of the word is to refer to outer space where the stars are. ("When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars..." - Psalm 8:3)<br>  <br>  The third use of the word "heaven" is to refer to the specific place of God's dwelling place, of which the Bible does not give us its precise location. ("Our Father, which art in heaven..." - Matthew 6:9)<br>  <br>  Hell<br>  ------<br>  Despite the popular belief about hell being in the center of the earth, or in some other dimensional plane of existence, and even though this is espoused by many in the Christian community, if you want the Bible's teaching on the matter, see Revelation 20:7-10 which says that:<br>  <br>  1) Hell does not yet exist today<br>  <br>  2) Hell will be on the surface of this planet<br>  <br>  <br>  Revelation 20:7-10:<br>  ---------------------------<br>  Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea. They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them. The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where[a] the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.<br>  ---------------------------<br>  <br>  Also contrary to popular belief, the fires of hell does not burn for all of eternity, but will burn, without interruption, until it has consumed all it has to burn. Then it will burn out, and this earth will then be recreated and thereby restored to its original state before sin entered it. (See Revelation chapter 20 and Isaiah 47:14)<br>  <br>  FYI, there are several examples in the Bible where the word "forever" or "unquenchable" refer to events that have already ended. For example, Jude 1:7 says Sodom and Gomorrah suffered the vengeance of eternal fire, but those two cities are not still burning yet today (they were located where the Dead Sea is today). The Greek word that was translated into our English word "eternal" means that it could not be put out until it had consumed everything that it was burning. All too often, people today try to redefine what the Hebrew or Greek words mean by our definitions today. But context is important, and the Bible, as with any and all writings whether ancient or modern, must be read and understood in its context and in its intended meaning. We must not pour our own meaning into anyone else's work.<br>  <br>  Those who reject the free gift of life will not spend all of eternity in hell being tormented, for eternal life is not given to those who reject it, but to only those who accept the gift.<br>  <br>  It was Satan that said, "You will not surely die" (Genesis 3:1-4) in contrary to what God had said in Genesis 2:17 - "for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die". If the phrase "you shall surely die" was literally translated it would read, "dying you shall die" -- in other words, God was not saying Adam and Eve would die that very day, but that they would die because of it.<br>  <br>  But as I said, it was Satan who said, "You will not surely die". Sadly, many in the Christian community perpetuate this lie still today, claiming that when you die, you don't surely die but go to either heaven or hell. The Bible is clear, the soul who sins shall die (Ezekiel 18:20)<br>  <br>  The Bible clearly teaches that we are not immortal, that only God is immortal (1 Timothy 6:15-16), and that we will be given immortality at Jesus second coming 1 Corinthians 15:53 says, "For this mortal must put on immortality...", so if we are already immortal, why must we put on immortality?! We are not immortal.<br>  <br>  The Bible clearly teaches that the lost will die, not live eternally and miserably. (Malachi 4:1-6; Isaiah 47:14; 1 John 5:11-12) To teach that the lost will suffer eternal conscious torment for all of eternity is to claim that they too have eternal life, something that the Bible clearly teaches the opposite of!<br>  <br>  The choice is yours, and mine, and every individual's to make, each for them self:<br>  <br>  1) Life or 2) Death.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	I do not believe in an afterlife. I believe that both heaven and hell are experienced while we are alive here on Earth. Once we die, there is no more living of any kind. We go back to the state we were in before being born: nonexistence. Both heaven and hell, in the sense that I stated, are real. Each person will have their own version of heaven or hell. Some are born into it, some create their own, some seem to fall into it at some point in life.

U1pMvDvgaa	I just hate those haters who hate everything, I could give them all a pants down spanking.|`|EYqTV2EYaa	It depends on how the hater is 'hating' me. If she simply doesn't like me a lot and she's only giving me mean looks to show it, I'd laugh to myself and ignore. If she's spreading rumors about me, I'd tell the believers of those rumors 'if you hadn't anything from my mouth, it isn't true.' If the hater is constantly being a pest by verbally assaulting me, honestly, I may find myself in a tight situation. Sometimes, I would verbally assault them in return, but I'm afraid they would get angry and physically assault me. Therefore, I usually tend to ignore it, but if it gets to consistent and annoying, I'd give them a piece of my mind. For example, it happened once in the 12th grade. This girl in my science class hated everything about me for no reason at all. I was one of the nicest and coolest people one could meet in that school, but something about me didn't appeal to her. I thought, "Not to worry, I'm nothing she purchased in the entertainment isle." Nonetheless, they when I came to school with a purse, to her, it was 'fake.' If I wore sunglasses, she would tell me to take them off because 'I'm not the star I make myself out to be.' If I answer a question in class, I'm 'the know it all.' If I talk to someone near her seat, I'm 'bothering her.' Well, one time, she too it to the extreme, so I had to verbally assault her back. Surprisingly, she never said anything to me again. Haha, it's funny how girls bully, isn't it? It's completely different than a boy's method. Okay, continuing with how to deal with haters. Finally, if a hater would get physical with me, which is rare, I would have to defend myself. I'm not a fighter at all, as I'm too girly and easy to make cry, and chances are, I wouldn't even 'win' the fight. I would probably get beat from protecting myself, and I wouldn't care. I just would do what I feel I have to do, although, I'd only fight one-on-one with a GIRLY girl that doesn't know what she's doing and fights with open hands like me. lol. If it's a tough girl or a large of haters ready to fight, if they want to beat me up, they'd have to catch me first.|`|XycawhUkaa	Don't hate the them ignore them|`|0lpXN8p9aa	I realize that they are only slaves to their own hateful mind....|`|0Cy2PqA2aa	ignore them|`|qwvijKexaa	beat them|`|ef9bde338c53689b9b1568a4a538cb08aa	I stay away from people like that but if I have to deal with them then I try and not engage into any kind of debate with them because there is no reasoning with them at all and it would just be a waste of my time (plus, they love the attention).|`|HnkmYdYnaa	ignore them.

ygbhsZ2Zaa	You are under a serious misunderstanding if it is your impression that 'lineage from david' is a major concern in the messianic prophecies. In fact, it was debated for some time. The fact is, he didn't fulfill ~any~ of the requirements, unless of course you factor in that he was, at least, presumably JEWISH. Other than that- you claim he was divine and therefore not human- that, in fact, rules a him out right there, as one thing NEVER debated, and always clear, is that the Jewish messiah is a mortal. It is *never* implied otherwise. Even those that implied there would be both a priestly messiah AND a political messiah NEVER mentioned a demi-god semi-human divine messiah. Nor did G-d himself.<br>  <br>  Frankly, I'm not sure why a whole bunch of non-Jews are so concerned about a Jewish  concept in the first place- we probably think less about our messiah than you do. After all, Judaism focuses on life and G-d where xianity is preoccupied with death and a 'devil'|`|N5ubpPxcaa	There a certain tasks he must fulfill, which Jesus has not in his "first coming" he is supposed to fulfill them in his "Second Coming".

But Jesus's lineage cannot go through his human father, according to Christian theology, as Jesus's father was not Joseph the husband of Mary. According to Christian theology, Jesus's father was God. <br>  The Messiah traces his lineage only through King Solomon (II Samuel 7:12-17; I Chronicles 22:9-10). But according to Luke 3:31, Jesus was a descendant of Nathan, another son of King David, and not a descendant of King David through King Solomon. <br>  The Messiah cannot trace his lineage through Jehoiakim, Jeconiah, or Shealtiel, because this royal line was cursed (I Chronicles 3:15-17; Jeremiah 22:18,30). But according to both Matthew 1:11-12 and Luke 3:27, Jesus was a descendant of Shealtiel. <br>  <br>  For more info:<br>  <a href="http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org/</a>|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Given that in all likelihood the last of the descendants of King David was killed at the time of the Babylonian Captivity it would seem an impossible feat.|`|vEEeq7kYaa	First of all...Simeon Bar Kochba had many followers believing he was the hoped for Davidic messiah, and Sabbati Zvi had fewer, but still had his fervent hopefuls..both of them also failed to do the job and were thus dropped from the list of messiah hopefuls who lived both before and after Jesus. Jews don't worship messiahs, pray to or through them, or consider them as human sacrifice for sin, nor assign to them attributes of deity.  <br>  <br>  You see, for a Jew pinning hopes of messiahship onto a man isn't like the Christian concept of seeing that man as a medium of atonement, someone who one prays to or through or has any role or function of intermediary between God and man..because the Christian CONCEPT of the role, function and definition of messiah is utterly at odds with the concept of messiah in Tanakh and in the Jewish religion.<br>  <br>  There are many mistakes about Judaism found in the New Testament doctrine.<br>  Not all Jews could trace their lineage in the time of Jesus..but there have always been Jews of certain tribes who have had their lineages and still do.<br>  <br>  The claim is often made that the destruction of the Second Temple destroyed all the geneaologies of the Jewish people.  That is a really abusrd statement for several reasons..FAMILIES kept their own geneaologies and then as now..some families histories do get lost over time, but there are also families whose ancestries have been kept for thousands of years.  I know people who have ancestries that go back in unbroken record hundreds of years prior to the time of jesus. The families did not lose their geneaologies after the destruction of the FIRST Temple and were without one for hundreds of years..so why would they have all of a sudden lost them all after the destruction of the SECOND Temple?<br>  <br>  <br>  In every generation there is believed to be a potential messiah.  Jews believe that right now, someone is alive who could be the messiah hoped for..but it will never take any sales pitch to convince anyone on the planet who it is, once the job prophecied is done.<br>  <br>  Judaism is a complete and fulfilling faith without the messiah having yet done the job he is prophecied to do.<br>  <br>  Judaism is not Christianity minus Jesus as so very many people mistakenly appear to believe..there are so many core, key differences that your continued refusal to simply accept this is the key to your failure to understand why Jesus remains insignificant to Judaism<br>  <br>  I have given you many references in the past..some more than a year ago that would have answered this question fully if you had actually wanted to know what Jews believe and why from a purely contextual and Scriptural perspective.  I have seen dozens of other Jews also answer questions from you about Judaism that you only argue against.<br>  <br>  Yahoo Answers is not supposed to be for proselytizing or missionizing.  If you want to know what Jews believe or why Jews believe something, then why do you only argue against the correct and honest answers given to you about Judaism and use Christian replacement theology to justify that?<br>  <br>  I do not believe this to be a sincere question, but an attempt to bait and aruge with Jews over Christian replacement theology that has no bearing on our faith in God.<br>  <br>  Live your faith in peace and please respect the right of Jews to do the same.  <br>  Shalom<br>  <br>  edit: lol..grr at my slow dial up.

This is the first time a Sanhedrin, consisting of 71 Rabbis, has existed since the first century.<br>  <br>  The Sanhedrin is necessary to confirm a Messiah.  There are several criteria, including his performing a verifiable miracle, and of course he must be a desendant of King David.  A Sanhedrin is also necessary for the construction of a temple.<br>  <br>  I believe scripture predicts a coming false Messiah.  I believe the second beast of Rev. 13 will be this coming false Messiah.<br>  <br>  Rev 13:11 , “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.”  Lamb is a symbol for Christ, and the dragon is a symbol for the devil.  So, the verse is saying he appears like the Messiah, but his words are actually from the devil; hence, a false Messiah.<br>  <br>  I also believe the passage in 2 Thess. 2 where it talks about the son of perdition sitting in the temple like he is a god is not referring to the first beast/world leader, but is the second beast/false Messiah.<br>  <br>  The Jews would only allow someone they've accepted as their messiah to reside in a rebuilt temple in Jerusalem.  The second beast is described as a miracle worker.  <br>  <br>  Regarding the second beast Rev 13:13-14 states,  "And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast. . . ."<br>  <br>  The Son of Perdition is also described as deceiving people through miracles:<br>  <br>  2 Thess. 2:9-10,  "Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, And with all deceivableness. . . ."<br>  <br>  That's the criteria given for a false Christ:<br>  <br>  Mat 24:23-26,  "Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not."<br>  <br>  Secret chambers could be a reference to the inner rooms of the Temple.  Indeed, just a few verses back in this chapter v.15 states, "When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)"<br>  <br>  The holy place is a reference to the temple.  He will be in the inner rooms (secret chambers) and is the son of perdition shown sitting in a rebuilt temple in 2 Thess. 2:3-4. <br>  <br>  The first beast is never described as a miracle worker.  That distiction is only ascribed to the second beast.  Prophecy writers often confuse the two beasts from Daniel, to 2 Thess., to Revelation.  They copy each other and mislead the Christian populace who likewise confuse which beast is being discused.  They most often ascribe the verses speaking about the second beast to the first beast.  <br>  <br>  These prophecy writers also mislead people on who to call the antichrist.  The world antichrist only appears in 1 & 2 John, and only one criteria is given for that person, denying that Jesus was the Messiah.  Anyone claiming to be the false Messiah will deny Jesus was the Messiah.  Anti means "against" or "instead of."  Both apply.  He is "instead of" the real Messiah.<br>  <br>  He will also be more than just a religious leader.  The Messiah is supposed to combine the separate offices of prophet, priest, and king into one.  He will therefore be the president of Israel.  The accusation placed on Jesus' cross at his execution was "King of the Jews" because the Messiah is understood to be the king of Israel, taking his rightful place in the linage of King David.  The false Messiah will be a false prophet, the high priest in the temple, and the president of Israel.|`|Sn0CViR7aa	Jesus was related to King David on both sides. Matthew and Luke provide detailed genealogies.  Genealogy records were carefully preserved in his oral culture, which gave inordinate value to ancestral ties.  We know that Jesus was born during an arduous journey to respond to a census in Bethehem, the city of David.<br>  <br>  We also know that Jesus did not put much stock in ancestry and ethnicity.  John the Baptist said (Matthew 3:9), "And do not think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham."<br>  <br>  Jesus taught that his ancestry with David wasn't the whole story (Matt 22).  Quoting a pslam, " 'The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet." Jesus commented, "If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Bruce|`|ouXrNitMaa	There were 2 men after Jesus whom the Jews DID accept as their long-awaited Messiah.

They go straight into sex and call it love when it is lust. It is fornication plain and simple. God says these things about that.<br>  <br>   1 Corinthians 7:2 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.<br>  <br>   1 Corinthians 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,<br>  <br>  There are different kinds of love. Godly love from God. brotherly love which is respecting each other as a brother or a sister, you have maternal love that you feel for your child,and then there is spousal love. That special indescribable love you have for you husband or wife.<br>  <br>  But because people see things and live in the carnal mind they can't distinguish between them. Lust is not love. Lust is of satan not God<br>  <br>  1 Peter 4:1-2  Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;<br>   <br>  2 That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Yeah, some of the book of David is hot!<br>  <br>  But, yeah you are right particularly in the NT, they don' t even want you thinking about sex let alone performing it.|`|sPemuE91aa	This might be a very foreign concept to some but LOVE is very important to God and he has taken much time to teach us about it.<br>  There are many examples of what it is to show true, Godly love between a man and a woman.<br>  <br>  The First example is Adam and Eve.<br>  There are many other examples in the Bible.<br>  Many of the people got it right(Joseph & Mary), but there were also many of those in the Bible that got their relationships wrong.

Jesus replied quoting the above verses saying  "It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied. "But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female. For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate."<br>  <br>  Love between a man and a woman is something God created to be. It's important to note that it's between one man and one woman, not two, three, or ten. This is called marriage. And God wants our love to be deep, so deep that death should be the only thing that separates us.<br>  God is the author of love, in its truest form.
g4nlUfmeaa	It depends on what you mean by the word "selfish."  As the word is commonly used, it implies an excess of self-interest.<br>  <br>  Self-interest is necessary, because it is unlikely that other people are going to take care of your needs and desires.  So in order to survive effectively, and be happy, generally it is a good idea be your own top priority, and to always strive to improve your situation.<br>  <br>  But like like I said, "selfish" implies an EXCESS of self-interest.  There is such a thing as "enlightened self-interest," where you act with the understanding that by helping others (or at least by treating them fairly), you can actually profit materially (and feel good doing it).  On the other hand, if you are short-sighted in exercising your self-interest (that is, if you take more than others feel is your due, or if you profit excessively at other people's expense), or if you are indulge yourself in cruelty or sadism, you may face legal, social or financial consequences that will make things unpleasant for you (and your conscience may trouble as well).<br>  <br>  So it's good to try to act with wisdom, rather than being brazenly selfish or naively generous.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Remember, "no man is an island," and if you're always selfish, you'll always be an island and alone, and miserable.|`|yJq1uqZ6aa	you're less likely to be a patsy<br>  <br>  (and no, i'm not saying it's good overall to be selfish)|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Nobody will bother you as you get older.|`|utObT8QAaa	People hate you, but you get your way with things and all.<br>   Although everyone around you will be uncomfortable, and they might want to get back at you.|`|A6BIcfTjaa	None.

AA11780840	It depends unless there is a delivery charge already in place...If the pizza was under $20 min.. $3.00 would be better for a pizza just under $20 but if that is all you have.... Just tell the driver I am sorry but this all I have....Customary tips 12-15% of the total bill if better then average service 18%.<br>  <br>  According to the website below:<br>  <br>  Pizza delivery drivers have a demanding job. Not only do they have to locate homes all over the city, usually at night, but do so in a timely fashion.<br>  <br>  They deal with winter driving conditions, pouring rain, traffic and a list of other in-store duties. They use their own vehicles (not company cars as a lot of people assume) and have to pay for maintenance and commercial insurance.<br>  <br>  In the course of a regular delivery they expend a lot of energy and time finding your house or apartment. Many houses do not have visible numbers, especially at night, and in a lot of cities parking is non-existent forcing the driver to walk with your order no matter what the weather conditions. Apartment buildings can be a maze and sometimes pets are a hazard to unsuspecting delivery drivers.<br>  <br>  While you only see the driver for a few minutes at your door they have spent a significant amount of time and energy to deliver your pizza to you.<br>  <br>  On top of this pizza delivery drivers are in danger of being robbed every time they leave the store. In the U.S. in particular, the government considers pizza delivery a hazardous occupation. This is due to statistics that show pizza delivery drivers are third on the list for being murdered at work after police officers and taxi drivers.<br>  <br>  For all this work the companies that employ drivers pay most minimum wage. Drivers, just like restaurant servers, rely on tips to earn a decent living.<br>  <br>  How Much To Tip?<br>  <br>  Tipping amounts vary slightly depending on the region. For a place like Ajax, Toronto you would expect to tip approximately the same as for restaurant servers:<br>  <br>  ? 12-15% is the general rule.<br>  <br>  ? 20% or more should be given for extraordinary service.<br>  <br>  ? 10% or less for poor quality service.<br>  <br>  ? No tip for rude behavior or extremely bad service.<br>  <br>  ? For orders less than $20 a $3 minimum tip should apply.<br>  <br>  ? For orders more than $50 a 10% minimum should apply.<br>  <br>  ? During foul or extreme weather it is considerate to tip a little more. You don’t want to go outside so think about how the driver feels. They have to deal with excessive heat, snow, freezing rain, windstorms etc.<br>  <br>  ? If you live a long way from the store you should also tip a little more. One or two dollars extra being the average. This is the polite thing to do when you know it will take the driver at least 20-30 minutes to reach your home.<br>  <br>  In the end please remember that delivery drivers work hard to provide you with an invaluable service. Most of us order pizza when the weather is bad, usually at night and on the weekend. It is a great convenience and a service we would not have if it weren’t for the delivery drivers.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.... I run into the same problem.

IhzeHAx4aa	If a Christian was really curious about evolution they wouldn't ask an online forum regardless of the section.  they would march down to their closest university and ask a biology professor there. (note: a christian college defeats the purpose.) Or head down to the nearest natural history museum  Hell opening a textbook would go a long way instead of asking the R&S section here.|`|e51d513ea5bf8209f78025130c42d6a8aa	No not really...just means they value this community and the various perspectives and levels of intelligence in this community.  They also want a lot of answers.  If it was posted in the Biology section alone they may hardly get any answers.<br>  <br>  If I have such questions I usually will post 2 questions one in Biology and the other in R&S.  I post all types of questions in R&S though because I value the members of the this community and want a quick answer.|`|N0iM1mo8aa	So, when evolutionists who want to disprove Christ ask their questions here don't really want answers either?<br>  <br>  Evolution and creationism are not necessarily exclusive.  Possibly God used evolution to further His creations.  I don't know and really don't care.  The issue of evolution v creationism doesn't dismiss God.|`|7sEFufRbaa	Wow, I thought you were talking about atheists.  You know asking all those evolution and science questions in R/S. I especially love the one about burden of proof.    As the burden of proof is essential when we are discussing things within the framework of SCIENCE.  Philosophy, metaphysics and Religion are not within that framework.    I guess atheists can't differentiate between the arts and the sciences.|`|WwCBomTMaa	It's funny that you "don't want any such answer from people who believe the world was created" considering the fact that you asked these exact people a question. A little close minded aren't you? By saying this does it mean that you really don't want answers? Like you are accusing us?<br>  <br>  Stop accusing and start learning. If you don't want answers then don't ask questions.<br>  <br>  Have a great day!! :)|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	It's just like the atheists asking the same old stupid questions to try to cast doubt and hate.  They have no real spiritual or religious character, so what are they doing here?|`|TEX1iYQgaa	What are your sources?<br>  <br>  What you're describing is the same tactic that atheists use by asking Bible questions.|`|44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	Dearest Andrea,<br>  I have not seen too many people do that on here.  There are some people who have closed minds on both sides and keep asking the same silly questions and refuse to read and study the other side of things.  I am a Creationist and I believe I have all of the answers that I want but I still read and study everything that I can.  I do have a science degree and I am really not too "slow" in that area.  Have a great week!!<br>  Thanks,<br>  Eds<br>  ------<br>  <br>  .|`|bXdOfByeaa	They ask their questions here instead of Biology because they are coming at it from a religious stand point. Biology doesn't cover that. Also, I am a Christian and I completely accept the theory of Evolution. Neither the theory of Evolution or the theory of Abiogenesis discredits a creator. There are many Christians that will not learn about Evolution because they think it is trying to discredit God. Atheists seem to be more educated on the topic, so they choose them to have an educated debate.|`|pfNnuD5saa	I am a Christian, I accept evolution and love science. I think you mean creationists, Not all Christians are creationists, not all creationists are Christian.|`|gsTpQmGfaa	The bible has an answer for every question, and a question for every answer.

I'm a Christian and do believe with good solid reason that although God started the Creation process (law of bio-science = Life has to come from life), evolution is the process that continues it onward.  Believing in BOTH  God & Evolution does not mean you are not a Christian nor "one of them" !  Most people do not understand the Evolution process nor do they understand what God is about.  This is where people choose sides and the war is on.  When Christians apply a LITERAL interpretation of the Genesis account to the Bible, a misunderstanding is created.  The Bible was never intended to be a Science book nor was Evolution intended to be a book on God.  True Science and True Biblical facts DO support one another !|`|PqBYGv1vaa	Clearly, stating the various proofs against the theory of evolution will not avail much here as the inquirer has proven in the content of their message...HOWEVER, the ultimate problem here is deception.<br>  <br>  There is a great section of Isaiah 44:9-20 where God is describing a man who cuts down a tree, burns some of the wood to cook his food and takes the rest of it and makes a "god" out of it; an idol.<br>  He bows down to the idol and worships it, praying to it, "Rescue me, you are my god!"<br>  <br>  But the man who made it never stops to reflect and say to himself, why it's just a piece of wood, I burned part of it to heat my food, how can the rest of it be a god? He is trusting in something that can give him no help at all. Yet he cannot bring himself to ask, is this thing I am believing in a lie? Such foolishness...<br>  <br>  He was under deception. Now you say, well no one does that today! How stupid your example is! Well how about those who put their trust in themselves, or in evolution, or in buddhism, or islam, or mormonism, or 7th day adventism, or hinduism. <br>  <br>  So many people just believe these things, but they are unwilling to be intellectually honest with themselves and bring themselves to ask in their hearts, is thing I am believing in...a lie? <br>  <br>  AND THE REASON IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO COME OUT OF DECEPTION IS BECAUSE THE DECEPTION HAS BECOME OUR IDENTITY. People have invested ALL of themselves in believing and living out the lie; so much so that if they were to investigate and come to the conclusion that they have been following a lie it would be too crushing for them to come to grips with. <br>  <br>  But ultimately, truth is truth. There is only 1 truth. Truth is not whatever anyone wants it to be. If I believe that I can fly, the truth will be that I cannot. Just believing something is true doesn't make it so. There can only be 1 truth. And that is why truth is singular, and not plural. <br>  So, whatever the truth is, it should be followed, no matter what that means as far as changing our lifestyles to fit it. I wasted my whole life before Christ came to me and revealed the Truth to me. It meant a lot of things had to change so I could live in the Truth, but life has never been better, and it keeps on getting better all the time.<br>  <br>  As for me and my house, we personally know Jesus Christ and we love Him and have seen Him do great and mighty things and regularly feel His touch, witness His healings, hear His voice and receive His provision and favor and miracles.|`|kwWiMrmgaa	The fact is, my dear, that there are HUGE holes in the theory of evolution. Darwin himself in "The Origin of Species" acknowledged this. Why aren't scientists forced to account for the holes and inconsistencies? For example, the lack of transitional fossils. No one ever seems to be able to get around that one. How about a real basic one: everything we know, everything we can see and touch was created by someone. You can honestly look at this world with all the intricacies of life believe this all just a happened. Do you know how precise everything in our atmosphere alone has to be in order to support human and animal life? It's absolutely asinine, the more you learn about this earth and our universe, to insist on denying the fact of creation. How about the most basic question of all, how does something come from nothing? Where did the initial "something" come from? Now for possibly the most relevant question: why aren't scientists who contend the no-creator-life-evolved-from-nothing "theory" allowed to take part in the debate. I'm sorry...the first question would be "what happened to the debate?" Why aren't we presented with both sides of the argument? You see, intellectual honesty requires the acknowledgment and examination of all legitimate evidence - that includes evidence that both supports and disproves a theory. Why aren't credentialed scientists given a voice? Oh, you didn't know there was another side to the argument other than, "the Bible says so?" Why am I not surprised.|`|qEYYHNyyaa	Bingo!<br>  <br>  The same can be said about their belief in god:<br>  The superstitious cultist who goes to church does not avoid rationally<br>  examining the question of the existence of God because he is certain that<br>  God exists, but rather because he is certain that God does not exist at all.<br>  What he truly wishes to avoid is not the knowledge of God’s<br>  nonexistence, but rather the inevitable results of that knowledge, which<br>  is the end of his association with his cult, and the inevitable attacks that<br>  will descend upon him from his fellow cult members.|`|WjRqYf6naa	If I had a question on evolution, I would definitely post it in the Biology section. I am very satisfied with my belief in Creationism, and I have no interest in pointless debate on the subject.|`|3qqvFEsHaa	They know they will get laughed at if they ask biology questions in the biology section<br>  <br>  They still get laughed at, but because it is in the religion section, the odds are higher that they receive an answer from another delusional uneducated person like themselves<br>  <br>  But yeah they are not looking for answers, I dont really understand why they ask science questions|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	The biology section doesn't get as many answers.  Asking here gets answers from both sides.  But the repetitiveness, regardless of section, is the silly part.|`|7ylYxklsaa	Bingo.|`|oojO4WAraa	It proves we need to teach evolution in school.
le9ZROs5aa	I never had "online" friends before I started coming here. It is hard not to make friends and get close to people on the LGBT board as we candidly give each other glimpses into one and others souls in our Q&A's. From the serious questions and answers to the playful LGBT surveys we learn a lot about the asker/answerer. We pour our hearts out, joke around, bicker and fight, and defend and comfort each other on a daily basis. I laugh at anyone who says a Y!A friend isn't as real as a "real life" friend. Sure you do run across a few fakers here and there but that happens just as often in the offline world as it does here. Basically what I'm saying is I consider all of my contacts and a few others real friends and love them all.|`|61c8oevtaa	I joined around about the same time as you. Y!A really has changed my life... I'm not just saying that. <br>  <br>  It's so good to be able to have somewhere where people actually understand me, like everyone's been through what I've been through and we all understand each other. My friends in real life are supportive, but they can't really relate to what it feels like being gay.<br>  <br>  I've met so many amazing peopleon here, and although sometimes I wish I hadn't got addicted lol, it's worth it just to have met all these people and made all these friends I never would have made.<br>  <br>  *hugs*<br>  <br>  Sergio... please! Video! Please!<br>  <br>  Edit: Damn you! Well I guess I won't have to pester you for it anymore *sigh* =[|`|AA10601065	I really just stumbled across Y!A one day and thought it was a great thing. I started reading questions and answers in all kinds of subject areas before I finally found the LGBT group. How has it affected me... well, I like reading the questions (well, the good one's... the "Help, I think I'm gay" ones got old real fast), especially when I find one that really makes me think. You can tell which questions those are because they're the ones that I usually give the longest answers to. I also see a lot of support here. I was away from Y!A for a year and just recently decided to get involved again. Since I've come back, I see many recurring faces and I've noticed that they tend to answer each other's questions and support each other a lot. I find that I'm starting to do the same--I'm starting to pay attention to the questions that my contacts ask more than going into the general questions, which I guess means I'm trying to become part of the community. The only other impact Y!A has had on me is when I receive a Best Answer. It makes me feel like I've really helped somebody (I like helping people, what can I say?). Does any of this make any sense at all? My mind is on several different things all at once at the moment, so I don't know if I'm effectively stating my thoughts. I hope I am, though. Good question, Daoie.|`|PHulI9apaa	i feel so unlike everyone i know in real life, so i come on here and just watch the questions coming past looking at ones i can relate to and then just say to myself "you see? there are people exactly the same as you!"<br>  <br>  <br>  It just helps!|`|PSzzjf4naa	Altho there are mean little cliques and  barriers in the gay bar scene , I feel that here a more open dialog can take place .

This place can improve the experience of the real life face to face gay community -|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	I do feel changed. I remember how naive I was when I first joined and was almost afraid to answer questions here. The first person I remember has to be HaK, I don't remember why but I remember you. I also feel much smarter than I was when I first joined. Everyone here is definitely part of a family, I think all of the sections have little families like ours but, from what I've seen ours is one of the best out there. <br>  <br>  Bye Bye|`|e7gkttgcaa	call me wierd ..i feel loved* or something here<br>  <br>  ..im not used to love or whatever in real life...and it feels good<br>  <br>  oh and Luca, its now private!|`|g7uMKvEzaa	It has taught me alot about different personalities that come here and more so how to help others if I can. It does effect my household chores for the worse. I get here and stay way too long.. I actually , Don't know a soul but I do notice some of the same people from my contacts. I don't ask  many questions but I do read many answers to many questions.. I get lots of smiles and some laughs..It kills time..<br>  It did make a positive effect on my credit card balance....I hope I am not hurting the economy too much by not shopping near as often ..LOL but very true..|`|1HbJS4hBaa	I met my boyfriend on here.  :-)|`|71mz0DNJaa	its made me more confident in who i am. i mostly hang out on the glbt section and reading that other people have had similar experiences to what ive gone through is pretty encouraging. you also dont feel as alone anymore. plus i dont shy away from being who i am, for instance im in the public library where anyone could come in and see that im looking up questions on being gay and what not, and i dont care if they see anymore =]|`|FdfmAZIJaa	YA has given me the strength to accept my sexuality and who i sm as a person. <br>  <br>  xoxo|`|LHljEdcUaa	i like it. i've laughed a lot and learned a lot of things too. I have also come to appreciate a lot of fellow atheists here.|`|YY8mFZxfaa	I come here on and off to see what service I could provide for the online community as well as the younger generation.  I would often get fed-up with questions like, “do you think I am gay?”, “LGBTQ answer this.”, “or even worst, questions pertaining to whether gay people have the right to marry, or even exist in this world.  Then I would see well thought-out questions like yours that makes me come back and try to shed some light on my personal experience.<br>  While online forums like Yahoo Answers have a good intention of trying to solve some of life’s dilemmas, it is not the be-all-end-all problem solver.  There is a lot to be said about local LGBTQ Service Centers and the ability to provide the much-needed inter-personal interaction.  There are a lot of wonderful folks here that are providing good answers and I applaud each one of you for asking and answering questions that truly does deserve to be answered (and there are simply too many if you ask me).<br>  I wouldn’t say that YA affected my personal life.  It definitely has an impact on how I see the younger generation of gay folks.  It has provided me with hope and aspiration that maybe we (meaning the older gays such as myself), have done something right by being role models.  Thanks for asking and good luck!|`|aYqCb3olaa	I adore this place ;]<br>  its helped me so much<br>  the few weeks I've been<br>  here, and all my contacts<br>  are amazing. I know I'll have<br>  stronger bonds with them<br>  someday.|`|iSvDvFneaa	I feel like I belong somewhere.<br>  And I feel so comfortable in the LGBT section.|`|jL6ppXqNaa	It's made me answer a lot more questions so I finally reach level 2 and can downvote jerks like Jolly Rancher|`|lV3Hk7M1aa	I first joined Y!A because i had a lot of questions about sex and pregnancy, most of which applied to my life, others were just out of curiosity. Some things I learned by asking questions, but i also learned a lot from reading other people's stories and experiences. I really feel that Y!A made me wise beyond my years, considering im seventeen and getting best answers for fertility questions. By now you probably guessed that I am most actively answering/asking questions in the Pregnancy and Parenting section, which is true. I love that section because I feel that what I say doesn't just help them, it impacts their lives.<br>  <br>  I love how kind people can be on this site, but I hate how rude people can be. In the P&P section, we get a lot of people asking and answering extremely ridiculous things that make it obvious that they are making fun of the people in that section. <br>  <br>  Yes the majority of people on here are rather accepting, but there are the occasional jerks that are rude just because they disagree with your opinions, which its fine if they have their own opinions, but you shouldn't say people are 'sick' because their opinion is different than yours. (I'm not saying you did, this refers to an incident with an extremely ignorant person)<br>  <br>  But you're right Y!A is like a family, and I'm glad because a lot of these people have no where else to go, and although people get annoyed of redundant, seemingly obvious questions, they answer them anyways because it IS a family.|`|n0WyMoX5aa	i met the love of my life on here|`|vTd5MQ1waa	It's F**ked me over and broken my heart twice now|`|UbvglIS6aa	I like coming here, too.  Most of the time anyway.  It's not a good idea for me to come when I'm in a bad mood though.  I get more than a little annoyed at certain people and things on those days.  It's best for me to leave and come back later when I'm in that kind of mood.  <br>  <br>  I've seen people on here at their best and occasionally at their worst.  I can truthfully say that I like most of them.|`|uky2nsh8aa	awww, ur such a sap, silly. <br>  haha, honestly, Y!A has played a part in saving my life. sometimes i just want to cut so deep i'll never wake up, but i come on here instead and give out cookies to you guys cause i like yall sooo much. lol<br>  <br>  *gives out hugs and cookies and throws a cupcake at daoie's head for fun*<br>  <br>  Notey~I AM NOT NICE!!!!!!!!  >.<|`|KszocgnSaa	I love it here.

I can't remember there name but I haven't seen them on, all I know was they were cool. Then HaK, lol her and her cupcakes. I tried to leave once cuz I get trolls but people made me stay. Yes made lol I'm so idk lol. I never thought I would grow close to people either. I wish they wouldn't get close to me cuz I'm soo like dangerous to everyone. Haha I warned them. Anyway there are a few people I talk to like everyday. They listen to me, I listen to them. Most the questions I ask are for the enjoyment of others. HaK and a few others tell me to make surveys and of course I listen. The people here are nice and make me laugh, I can't see myself leaving. They make me not do things I shouldn't...so thanks.

3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	No, because I understand where they came from.  Rapture comes from the Latin vulgate, translated into the Greek it was "harpazo", a catching up.  And tribulation is in the bible, dear.|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	The only place I see those are typed by atheists here on R/S.|`|JCGtfNeTaa	While the word "rapture" itself is not in the Bible, the concept is.<br>  <br>  In 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17, the phrase translated "caught up" comes from the Greek word "harpazo". This is the phrase people are referring to when they talk about the rapture.<br>  <br>  It refers to the second coming of Jesus. While the Bible does teach that we will be "caught up" (i.e. raptured), it does not teach a secret rapture.<br>  <br>  The tribulation is something that is also talked about in the Bible. For example, Jesus gives us the following encouragement in John 16:33<br>  <br>  These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.<br>  <br>  There are many words that mean the same thing. For example, if I use the word "canine", would it make sense for people to claim that I did not talk about "dogs" at all? Dog and canine mean the same thing.<br>  <br>  Just because a specific word is not found in the Bible, does not mean that a different word meaning the exact same thing was not used, or that the concept itself is not talked about. The concept may be described in great detail, even if a single word that codifies that concept is not used.|`|PKULDaC7aa	But if Kirk Cameron says Tribulation then its as biblical as we need!|`|casg30Ataa	You mean like internet and television?|`|uD8d5V9Saa	No I don't worry about those words.  Why do you?|`|PtIyg9Qqaa	Tribulation is a VERY biblical word.  Everyone has tribulation in their lives.  John 16:33; Acts 14:22; Rom. 2:9; 5:3; 8:35; 12:12; 2 Cor. 1:4 and more.<br>  <br>  If you mean in an eschatological sense, it is just as biblical - Matt. 24:21, 29; Mark 13:24; Rev. 2:10; 7:14.<br>  <br>  Rapture is in the Bible if you consider that it comes to us from the Latin, rapiemur in 1 Thess. 4:17, which means caught up.<br>  <br>  I'm concerned more about so-called biblical ideas like "eternal torment," "immortal soul," "accept Jesus," "go to heaven," and "personal savior" which REALLY AREN'T in the Bible.  Go ahead.  Try to find them.  Sure, you'll probably make an argument that the IDEAS are there.  But are they really?|`|OAjN34M4aa	Those are words of fairly recent origin that DO describe biblical prophecy. Your argument is like saying that since the word "dinosaur" was not coined until the 1800s, dinosaurs must not have been invented before then.|`|1Ms1QqPTaa	Those are words invented to describe what will take place in the end times, as descibed in the Bible. I don't focus on them because they are really of little effect to me, but it sounds like you do, which is good......|`|DDwecKakaa	God is in a good mood is full of crap.

V66Sexkvaa	No. Hispanics are people with background from a Spanish-speaking country or group.<br>  Brazilians are Latin Americans though, so technically they could be called latinos but in USA that term is sometimes reserved for hispanics.|`|16EYP0Xiaa	Brazilians speak Portuguese, therefore they are not Hispanic [Spanish language/culture]. However, they are Latino because Portuguese is also a Latin language.|`|5Bpzt3Cnaa	Nope , they are not hispanic , because Brazilian speak portuguese and not spanish !|`|Ps9eOIchaa	No,they are latino,but Brazilians are not a race,in Brazil,they have blacks,hispanics,europeans and asians.You can be any race/ethnicity and be brazilian<br>  You can ask any Brazilian what they consider themselves,they'll say latino,but state that they are not hispanic|`|APAwebK1aa	Brazilians ARE NOT HISPANIC OR SPANISH.<br>  <br>  Brazilians are Portuguese (40 million), Italian (32 million), German (15 million), Jewish (about 300,00), Arabs, Japanese (more than 1,4 million), Korean, Greek, Russian, Polish (more than 2 million), Ukranians (1 million)  and Brazilians hispanics are about 12 million (less than 10%). USA have more hispanics than Brazil, but, nobody calls the USA as a hispanic nation.<br>  <br>  Hispanic surnames as Gonzales, Calderón, Maldonado and others, are rarest than german names or pollack names. Much more, by the way!<br>  <br>  Hispanic names as Paco, Diego, Juan and others, are rare and considered foreign name as Erick/Erika, Emmerson, Yuri, Ivan, Raissa, Natalia, Olga and others. But, these last (Russian names), are much, much more populars than names of hispanic origins.<br>  <br>  BRAZILIANS: LATINOS?<br>  Some people say "because you are latinos". Brazilians speak portuguese, which is a latin language, but, greek languange, also and nobody call us greek people.<br>  <br>  Romanians speak romanian, which is a latin-slavic language, but, nobody say romanias are latinos, because thay are slavics as russians are. Based on this reasoning, these same persons must call french and italian as latinos, but, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT BOTH ARE CALLED EUROPEANS AND WHITES. <br>  <br>  By the way, the US Department of Immigration uses a classification where race opitions are WHITE, NATIVE AMERICAN, ASIATIC, AFRO DESCENDANT, and HISPANIC/LATINO. So, these term "latino" is used with conotation of race. Something is not black but cannot be white because some idiot don't want this.<br>  <br>  <br>  I see cleary a wish to classify brazilians with a pejorative term "latino" that is associated to ilegal immigrants, dark skin (why, if people from Spain are white?), undevelopped country, poor persons, dictatorship, and other ofensive and stupid pre-concepts about other people. Only a great ignorant think this is the true Brazil.<br>  <br>  To learn more about Brazil and Brazilians, I invite you to watch my favorit videos in myYoutube channel:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=AllAboutBrazil&view=favorites" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=AllA...</a>|`|pfke6Jieaa	no they are the only country who is not considered hispanic. they are just called south american. along with all other south americans.|`|LEffPiujaa	Nope.|`|7pM0DIfdaa	No...we aren't....we are considered Latino.....<br>  <br>  we speak a broken style of spanish known as portuguese..<br>  <br>  we are more in tuned with nature makin us very peaceful people and <br>  we love travelers....<br>  <br>  personally i dont consider myself even near spanish but thats me and fact being again that we arent..|`|zTuc5eDIaa	Latin American?

mVTGl6HGaa	Spanish National Honor Society (Spanish: Sociedad Honoraria Hispánica) is an academic honor society focused on Spanish language excellence in secondary education and promotes a continuity of interest in Hispanic studies. The group, which was established in 1953 in the United States is sponsored by the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese. Society members are usually referred to as "Honor Spaniards."
RC5RAzykaa	Rahab in the Hebrew is ??? transliterated "Rachab", pronounced "r?·kh?b".<br>  <br>   We see the original pronunciation is rather harsh sounding.<br>  <br>  Rahab means "wide" or "broad" when referring to the sea, it means "thick" when referring to a wall, it means "long and broad and spacious" when referring to a cup or a vessel.  It means "extending widely every way" when referring to land.  It has been used metaphorically in Psalm 119:96 I have seen an end of all perfection: [but] thy commandment [is] exceeding broad.  In this verse the word "broad" in the Hebrew is "Rachab" or "Rahab".   <br>    <br>  Rahab or "Rachab" has also been used metaphorically to denote an inflated sense of pride.<br>  <br>  Our names mean something Abby, your name is a diminutive of Abigail.  <br>  <br>  Abigail, in the Hebrew is ?????? transliterated 'Abiygayil pronounced ab·ē·gah'·yil and it means "my Father is joy" a reference to your heavenly Father.<br>  <br>  Now, Rahab may sound pretty, and you may name your daughter that if you like, but you will be naming her a wide, thick, proud broad, after a harlot.  If you name her this, she might find out the meaning of her name someday, and she might have questions for you.  Besides that, it sounds like "Rehab" and I've been there, it ain't no fun.  <br>    <br>  The Biblical Rahab did show herself to be righteous in the long run however, as so many have told you in their answers,<br>  But the meaning of her name remains the same.  <br>  <br>  But it sounds nice, I will give you that.  But if you like "Rahab" you might consider the name "Rachel", it is somewhat similar, but it is so much nicer.....it means "ewe", a female sheep, and we are all of the sheepfold of Christ Jesus, for He is the Good Shepherd.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. I can find no evidence that "Rahab"  means "rejoice" or "speaks boldly" as Jarhead has asserted, not to call him a liar, I simply have not been able to find this, nor would I trust the NASB Concordance.  <br>  <br>  We should always be careful to limit our study of Scripture to the original King James Version, as others contain error.  This is not an opinion, but a statement of fact.  Stick to the KJV and God bless you Abby.|`|WjRqYf6naa	It is a good name. She did right by God's people and was rewarded in turn. You can name your kids anything you like. It beats the heck out of some names I've heard. I knew one girl who named her daughter Felonee, because that was what the father was on probation for. (True story.)|`|HBp5r76haa	"31By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient"<br>  Hebrews 11:31<br>  <br>  Rahab had faith in the LORD and she was spared - her and her family.|`|89MKzLl3aa	That's fine. Just live in LA were names like that is normal.|`|macZI2dzaa	Rahab (Hebrews 11) was a woman of faith.  She was one of the most blessed women in the Bible.  She lived (as a prostitute) in a city that had not fallen to foreign armies in about 500 years, yet she believed that God would destroy Jericho.  Because of her faith she hid the Israeli spies and she and her family were the only ones saved out of Jericho.  <br>  God then saw fit to bless her by putting her in the lineage of Christ.  If God would name her in the genealogy of the Christ (Matthew 1), I think it is quite good to name a child after her.  May that child also be a child of faith.|`|SuhnBZTgaa	No it's not weird. & if anyone tells you differently tell them that in Hebrews 11:31 it says - <br>  <br>  "By an act of faith, Rahab, the Jericho harlot, welcomed the spies and escaped the destruction that came on those who refused to trust God." <br>  <br>  Hebrews 11 is often referred to as the "Hall of Fame for Faith" so her being mentioned there is pretty special. She is one of only two women mentioned! (The other is Abraham's wife Sarah.)|`|566cnzTyaa	Her having been a prostitute was outweighed by her faith and righteousness.  It is a wonderful example of repentance and forgiveness by God.  I think it is a wonderful name.  When I think of her I don't picture her as a prostitute but rather as a faithful servant of God.  <br>  Rahab was later able to dwell among the Israelites and she was also one of 4 women named as an ancestress of Jesus in Matthew 1:5.  She was also declared righteous by works James 2:25 and because of her faith she was preserved alive at Jericho.  Heb 11:31.|`|5hD0alFyaa	I don't see why not. After all she is part of the lineage of Jesus Christ. She is counted in the book of Hebrews as having been saved from perishing by faith and being justified in the book of James. She is in a sense a hero of the faith and she will be one you will see in Heaven. Rahab's story is one of victory over sin. She was a harlot yes, but she did not end as a harlot. I think it's a good name. By the way, I named my son Eli after the High Priest who raised the prophet and judge Samuel. His story isn't as victorious as Rahab's unfortunately but I still like the name.|`|OAjN34M4aa	Rahab was a heroine. She had a gift of prophecy that told her God would give victory to the Israelites. She risked her life to help them. She saved her own family. She is part of the genealogy of King David and the earthly genealogy of Jesus Himself. If you like the name, I see nothing wrong with it.|`|78fc8bc2259086fa893dc874f9f06ecdaa	Mary is the name of a prostitute as well.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't name anyone Rahab, because it sounds too similar to rehab.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	Most prostitutes and strippers have the prettiest names. Go for it.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	It is a nice name, and, Rahab is spoken well of for her faith  :)  Rahab is in heaven now|`|PtIyg9Qqaa	Not good if someone asks what it means. The NASB concordance says it's:  to be or grow wide or large:  enlarge, extend, made wide, opened.  But it is translated once as "rejoice" and once as "speaks boldly."|`|JI1chuBQaa	Isn't Rahab also the name of a Jewish sea monster?|`|J3884g1haa	that's okay, everybody will just call her Rehab|`|yZXe2XLlaa	Rahab Jezebel Smith... great name!<br>  <br>  And Lucifer Beazlelbub for a Boy!

And I think the you're competitive... why don't you just move back to your own country and leave us alone|`|a3adecd468f8217562e162004a849a7faa	I believe your theory. Some/ Many people think globalisaton and multiculturalism mean the same thing but the supporters of globalisation mainly focus on economic globalisation and trade without barriers. In other words they are interested in what goods the person has to offer/ trade in but not the person himself/herself. I believe that the answer to  most current, global problems is a return to a small-scale way of doing things. We don't need to travel to other continents by air or live in very large groups. We are living in the hope that this will work but everything points to the exact opposite, i.e that it wil not work. Sooner or later we are all going to learn and accept this but this will be after even greater turmoil in the world. That's what I've observed.<br>  <br>  No, not even competition is going to work in the long run if we are going to embrace sustainable development for ours and our childrens survival . Leave a man to compete freely and he won't rest until all the waters have been fished empty of all their fish (a documentary was shown on BBC in which unlicensed fishermen fish illegally on the shores of West Africa simply because they've fished their own waters empty. But they have to sell, earn a living and make a profit so they will go to great lengths to achieve that. Melamin in infants milk or anything that will bring in a quick buck). It has all ran out of control but I know the thought of it is uncomfortable|`|PvPPivLJaa	Who says competition is a bad thing? Anyone who would resort to anger and violence when being faced with competition is no more different than a child andtheir opinions and viewpoints/ideologies should be treated as such.<br>  <br>  Rational, even-tempered individuals who do not suffer from a false sense of preordained superiority would fair just fine. The others are no more than deviants and threaten the good of the lot and...should be treated accordingly.<br>  <br>  We do not live in the stone age where groups were unaware, frightened etc of other tribes. We all know the players here. And we've got a good idea of what makes us tick.  <br>  <br>  There is no real reason to seperate races.  It all boils down to fear and an attempt to maintain a reality where you are somehow elite to someone else and that is a reality that nullifies everyone who doesn't fit that mold and so I cannot support it.<br>  <br>  What happened in that neighborhood does not mean that multiculturalism has failed. It means we are dealing with deviants in our society that should be eradicated and that goes for everyone of them. If it were not a different race, I assure you that person would have done the same to someone within his own because is devoid of character/morals and the things that are needed for a society to function and thrive.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Even though I know you probably hate black people, I actually do agree with most of the things you say. I'm tired of the media portraying images of black, whites, indians, latino's holding hands like there are no problems and everyone smiling and laughing, etc. That is not true and in reality, there is probably a lot of conflict in their culture.<br>  <br>  Yong Peng Sun/Jeremey- I didn't ask to come to this nation, I would GLADLY go back to Africa, if it was one of the nicer parts of West Africa.|`|oqs6n07aaa	The enemy is not certain groups of people. <br>  <br>  Besides, who is going to defend this country if we face a war? Only the Caucasians? The blacks? The Latinos? The Asians? Etc???<br>  <br>  In a time of war, EVERYONE will have to pull together and unify to defend this nation.<br>  <br>  If a prison contained white prisoners and there were no blacks, Latinos or Asians in the entire structure, the white supremacist groups would soon fight amongst themselves. They already do sometimes.<br>  <br>  The reasons for having multicultural, mutiracial nations is because it's going to happen anyway. It is inevitable as more and more people start to focus on things we have in common and realize that "cultural differences and racism" separate most of us. <br>  <br>  Into the mix, throw the fact that people are falling in love, marrying and having biracial/mixed children...<br>  <br>  Love is stronger and better than hate.<br>  <br>  And so it is IMPOSSIBLE to defeat now. Society does not go backward to the ways of the past. It just never does.|`|2xaVpnNNaa	well the last time we tried segregation, minority races, got the sucky end of the deal.<br>  <br>  so why should we do segregation, when one side is going try and be all "superior" again, and make the other races, have the sucky end of the deal?<br>  <br>  why would anyone want that?|`|1622ecafc126f00a89b5106dbc1ad36eaa	The reason is knowledge and fairness.<br>  <br>  <br>  simple as.<br>  <br>  <br>  we are all the same because we are different and we all have something to teach one-another<br>  :)|`|Dv5HiSSraa	We are all African. <br>  <br>  <a href="https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com" rel="nofollow">https://genographic.nationalgeographic.c...</a><br>  <br>  PS: Delete my answer one more time, Nate, then you are a coward.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Humans are language-based creatures.

Three good examples:<br>  1. The Catholics and protestants murdering each other in Northern Ireland. Now going on for 100 years. <br>  <br>  2. Then we have the Zionist who think their god was a developer and gave them some land. Happens that others were living on it too. Oopss. The folks living on the land named Palestine decided to fight back, so now we have Muslims fighting Jews; both of the male-dominated Abrahamic faith. Now the US, another nation and of the Abrahamic faith too, has since the Balfour Declaration of 1917 supported the Jews, so all three can fight and destroy. Oohh goody.This fighting harms all concerned. It is wasteful. Directly the USA gives both open and hidden (hidden in farm aid,  treaties and military agreements) aid to Israel of some two billion dollars a month and has for decades. This directly harms me by making my taxes high, gasoline prices high, and also makes us in the US a target for the Islamist terrorists who want to get at us for helping Israel. Thank you Abrahamics.<br>  <br>  3. The Muslims and Hindu fight over the northern Indian - Pakistani areas and both are nations full of poor and these two nations of god believers have nuclear weapons!

EpqSDAGyaa	At first the Europeans didn't go to the inner parts of Africa They stayed on the shore. Africans traded there people  for goods with Europeans. These africans would go into villages snatch the people up and take them to the shores to trade with Europeans. Unfortunately most of the africans that were trading slaves had no idea what lie ahead for the slaves. There was slavery in africa but the slaves weren't treated so brutally.|`|kvWF1a2Yaa	In Africa they are still being sold by there own people.|`|vcdhCiU6aa	Africans sold black people for butter and ice.|`|PvPPivLJaa	There were different tribes in Africa that were constantly feuding and sometimes that would sell captives of wars and battles they had fought to the traders, also traded for guns and other technologies not prevalent in Africa to get an edge in battle.<br>  <br>  Slavery was a huge part of African society way before the Europeans got involved. But, it was a different sort of slavery, and it was rarely lifelong and tortorous.  That is the difference.<br>  <br>  It was generally common for forms of slavery to occur.  It was property. But actively seeking slaves just for the sake of slavery wasn't in the picture until later..when Europeans arrived. It was normally a byproduct of debt or conquest.<br>  <br>  It was later that some became actual hunters for their fellow africans.<br>  <br>  There were also many instances where Africans were captured by Europeans, as well. Really, there is more than just Europeans to blame - African leaders were also fueled by power and conquest.|`|16EYP0Xiaa	Unfortunately, Africans had been captured, transported, and enslaved by Arabs long before the Europeans did it. Historians estimate that between 11 and 18 million black African slaves crossed the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Sahara Desert between 650 and 1900....far more than were brought to the Western Hemisphere.<br>  <br>  This activity was still going on after the end of the US Civil War, not only against Africans.  In fact, in the 1880s, my great grandparents left their coastal village in southern Italy [Calabria] because the Barbary Pirates still came to capture people to sell into slavery. Imagine that, white people fleeing to avoid being captured and sold as slaves....and this happening after the Emancipation Proclamation.|`|EJAvOHxGaa	Both, they were sold by their own people and also just snatched.|`|0hsh000waa	Most were stolen, some were sold. <br>  <br>  The ones that were sold were said to be the undesirable people in their particular tribe or country. Most ex soldiers, criminals, war captives etc..<br>  Many African chiefs who sold people were desperate for natural resources that the Portuguese promised in exchange. They were tricked and it's really a sad story.|`|yS9a9jk5aa	Mostly snatched. <br>  <br>  The ones they sold off were few and were the ones they were in war with. But trust me if Africans knew what would happen to the ones they sold off they would never allow it.

In my culture (Aymara) Andean animals like the condor, the titi, armadilo etc are also considered sacred animals.. while christians feel they have no souls and were placed for the usage of human kind (ego). so thats diverse... <br>  <br>  Science recognize that humans are part of the animal kingdom. It recognizes that different animals have cultures to different extents. it also recognizes that apes like chimps and bonobos share with us 90% of the same genetic make up. It also see that different animals think differently in order to survive.|`|pfNnuD5saa	Depends on the person. I am a Christian, I love science. I love animals. I think their plight on earth is often miserable and humans are cruel. There is no correlation between your view on animals, science and religion.|`|gebIjqnWaa	Science says religion is wrong. Religion says science is wrong. You won't know for sure until you die and realize religion's view was valid after all.|`|AA12283307	well not completely but scientists still are religious|`|KntBP2Zmaa	what status, that they are animals?|`|5cd72c27261c5c994c0b5c7e6eed47dfaa	I think all scientists and non-scientists agree that animals are animals. I have, however, met several non-scientists who feel that humans are not a form of animal.|`|cLATPkjkaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  Religion has no single view on animals, and neither does Science. Comparing the two makes no sense.<br>  <br>  The traditional Christian view and the biological view have very different opinions. Christianity holds animals were created for our use, while biology stresses being wary of that great intellectual mistake- ranking animals as "better" or "worse" on human scales, or viewing them as instruments of human use rather than biological units.
kX3Kn7Cjaa	In my dialect we hardly ever use the feminine article "ei".  I am from Oslo and my dialect is often, though incorrectly, referred to as "Bokm?l". It's traditionally the language most often heard in radio and TV. <br>  <br>  Even though we seldom use the feminine article, in singular, definite form the noun will still have a feminine ending in most cases. <br>  <br>  Examples: <br>  (f) en jente - jenta. (a girl - the girl) <br>  (f) en ku - kua (a cow - the cow)<br>  <br>  The masculine form "jenten" is used in some dialects, but it sounds ridiculous if you're not fluent in that dialect. ;-)<br>  <br>  Masculine and neutral nouns can sometimes get an a-ending in definite, plural in my dialect. Feminine nouns never do. <br>  <br>  Example:<br>  (m) gutter -  gutta/guttene (boys - the boys)<br>  (n) ?rer - ?ra/?rene (ears - the ears)<br>  <br>  People will definetely understand you if you only use the masculine form, but if your goal is to learn Norwegian I suggest you study the 20-50 most common feminine words once and for all. It will improve your general understanding of the language and will make it easier to understand most dialects. But I guess this depends on your reason for wanting to learn Norwegian in the first place. It's unlikely that anyone will correct your grammar outside of a classroom if you're not a native speaker. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qq5nceCXaa	I'm learning Norsk in Bergen and we don't use the feminine articles, but the books we used did have them in.<br>  <br>  I believe that the advice from the Norsk sp?ker?d is that all words are free choice so you don't have to learn them, but it's possibly a good idea to have at least know the most common words that take the feminine article, especially in the define form, f.eks<br>  <br>  jenta, kua, fela. geita, kona, klokka, tanta, uka, tida, natta, d?ra, bygda, ?ya, osv.<br>  <br>  What you'll find is papers like aftenposten will often use the more radical form, "common gender" approach and VG and Dagbladet will take the more traditional, working class separate gender form, but it's not a fixed rule.<br>  <br>  You'll find the dialect issues far outweigh all this when it comes to spoken forms anyway.|`|ndnyrEu2aa	others are correct. But be consistent. That is, if you say "boka" then don't switch to boken in the same conversation -- unless you know what you're doing.<br>  <br>  As pointed out, Bergen is quite happy using only en / et genders. Everyone will understand, but some words just have to be feminine (to my foreign ears-- konen 'the wife' sounds very funny, although it is permitted.<br>  <br>  You can always check the bokm?lsordboka on-line for forms accepted by the Language Council..<br>  <br>  If lists of nouns help, check out my website.

bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	I was in high school until 1968.  I went to a 'white school' ... in the three years I was at that high school, only one 'black student' ever made it through the two and a half years he went to our school (he had transferred in but lived in an African-American part of our large city).  He was elected class president as a junior, and was elected student body president as a senior.  This young man was extremely intelligent (on the lower edge of genius level) and had 'charisma' ... the innate ability to talk with anyone from any class and do it well.  As a 'mixed race' child, your mother would have had more problems with pure white or pure blacks, because there was far more prejudice then than there is now.  I've been out of school a very long time ... I'm a psychologist.  These days, while a person's race can still be a big problem, there are so many other problems, too ... one's sexual identity, one's 'class' (when obvious), etc.  Why don't you ask your mothet to tell you her stories of being in school first, then ask her friends now ... she should have people of all races as friends, or she could be 'isolated' because of her own 'racial upbringing.'  Then do a search for articles and blogs on the racial issues in schools, both back then and also now.  Good luck!|`|EJpiaCMQaa	I'm amazed to hear that!   I'm from the U.S., and I was born in 1964, and there were many different races in my school:  Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, and more.  I was in school from 1969-1982.  I live in the Chicago suburbs.|`|79Fcbmtvaa	Well, back in 1846 there wasn't many biracial people around. <br>  <br>  But, there WAS a lot of pie. Good pie. I likey dat pie, good ol' 3.14159265. I like strawbery pie, apple pie and banana pie. I remember when I first had a banana pie. I had just had chicken and mum layed this plate of banana pie in front of me, I was like "WHATTHEHELLISTHIS!?!". So she put the pie in my face. It was still 150 freaking degrees and I suffered burns to my face making me one ugly smellyfant.<br>  After this, life was hard. Constantly having people stare at you across the street, spit on you, hate you for no reason... And that's only because I was fat. Imagne the treatment an ugly fat man got. So what I said to them is, "In chemistry, a molecular orbital (or MO) is a mathematical function that describes the wave-like behavior of an electron in a molecule. This function can be used to calculate chemical and physical properties such as the probability of finding an electron in any specific region. The use of the term "orbital" was first used in English by Robert S. Mulliken in 1925 as the English translation of Schr?dinger's use of the German word, 'Eigenfunktion'. It has since been equated with the "region" generated with the function. Molecular orbitals are usually constructed by combining atomic orbitals or hybrid orbitals from each atom of the molecule, or other molecular orbitals from groups of atoms. They can be quantitatively calculated using the Hartree-Fock or Self-Consistent Field method." and they never did it again.<br>  <br>  THE END.|`|H17L1WW4aa	I graduated High School in 1989.

P2kL3apWaa	I'd say if you haven't had couples counseling.  Definitely consider it.  It could very well help save your relationship.<br>  <br>  Spend time with friends.  Pursue a hobby.  Meditate. Drink hot tea.  Get a massage.<br>  <br>  Sending you hugs.|`|P3JsbI7gaa	ugh i know how u feel.  ive been there.  and i really dont have any advice, i didnt eat or sleep when this happened to me. i  was going crazyyyyy.  hmm idkk i have anxiety pills to take when i freak out.  maybe watch tv or something idk go out with some friends.
8c3928ce39cd98e96b5b55afe6bfec47aa	How I explain my daughters & my dyslexia to people is the our brain misinterprets what it sees, causing problems with reading, writing and spelling etc, and that is not uncommon for a dyslexic person will mix up similar sounding words, or words read such as was to saw. <br>  I will then show them what a dyslexic person may see, see the top link below.<br>  <br>  I see the rivers in between the words and the words can swirl or washout, usually much worse when I have a headache or over tired. Causing nausea and reading next to impossible.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	I would show them an example of a word with the letters jumbled up & say it's like your brain flips the letters in the word, so you're having to figure out what the word is like a puzzle. With an small word such as "pots" to represent "stop" a person can easily recognize that any larger word would represent a time consuming challenge.|`|H7L66ynJaa	It is because they do not recognize letters in the way convention says they should.
WuhIoS1laa	Wrapped in what manner? <br>  <br>  With gift wrapping paper on the outside of the box, no - but not because it's 'illegal' but because wrapping paper is very frail and it will come off (along with any labels) before it arrives. <br>  <br>  If you want to wrap them in paper and place them in a larger box (your best bet) they won't care. <br>  <br>  The larger box is going to likely save you money as well over three individual packages. Check the weight, destination and dimensions on the postal service website. <br>  <br>  The box you send can be wrapped in plain brown paper. I used to use old grocery bags for this back in the day, Now you can buy packaging paper in an office supply store.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	The post office doesn't like wrapped packages because the paper can tear while going through processing and the address get torn off. You are better off wrapping them and then putting them in a good cardboard box.|`|7nHuDxivaa	They have to be all packed in a plain brown or white box. Most post office have x-ray scanners like at airports so they won't open the thing up unless something seems really suspicious|`|gspTDufpaa	You need a shipping box for all your things.Or a special envelope that they also sell.|`|Nj7hcXMWaa	YES!!!|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Put the wrapped package in a regular box, they can xray any suspicious packages.  I wrap things all the time and send them out. Another option, go to the post office main branch they usually have the cutest boxes that you can mail things in  like I bought a penguin motiff one that was really neat.  They don't cost that much and so you can just wrap your present in tissue and stuff in the box and tape it shut. They even had CD boxes and envelopes in the same motif.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Gift wrapped packages are fine as long as they are inserted into a shipper box.  You are not allowed to send anything gift wrapped on its own.  It's not about security.  It's about protecting the package from damage.  So wrap each item and put them in a plain cardboard box.  Fill with bubble wrap, lots of newspapers or peanuts and seal it with shipping tape.
Atcn9M3iaa	I don't know, but what was Gonzo up to with that phallus-shaped nose of his?|`|s6GKHKccaa	I never thought anything of it when I was a child but; now that I'm an adult, I wonder about two guys sleeping in the same bed and telling each other they loved one another.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Something else.|`|6gthdHpnaa	I always thought they were brothers.

It was just a gimmick to get more jokes in. So I always assumed that sometimes people shared beds and Bert and Ernie were like Morecambe and Wise. I was a very liberal child, haha.<br>  <br>  Yeah, maybe Bert and Ernie were gay. I don't care. Kids tend to just accept what they see and not worry about whether the puppets are having secret off-air buttsex. Anyway, I think they're awesome.
AA11297267	Personally I don't hate anybody or anything.<br>  I have a great deal of concern for very political christian groups that want to turn the US into a theocracy, so I voice my concern about that.<br>  And I have little or no respect for anyone who doesn't think things through and learn about all sides of an issue, but just blindly swallows what anybody tells them to believe.  Being entirely honest, if christians would keep their beliefs to their own church and/or themselves, and not to try convert and legislate and control anyone who doesn't think like them, there would be no issue whatsoever.<br>  <br>  You'll find it's human nature to stand up for one's self, and often to denigrate others who are different.  Look at the situation just within christianity -- you see one group here claiming another group "aren't real christians," you see them arguing about what the bible really means (sometimes very heatedly).  And the strongest private e-mails I get here are from christians...even if I just post something as innocent and straightforward as "No, I don't believe in your god," I'll get e-mails telling me I'm going to hell, that god is going to kill me in a car accident, or calling me vile names (including lots of obscene language).  I've never once sent e-mails to anyone like that just because they believed in god, but it sure seems to be "fair game" from christians to atheists, 'cause I get dozens a month.  That tends to make me have a lower opinion of christians than I might otherwise...<br>  <br>  <br>  Peace.|`|jfmb79V4aa	Atheism is the lack of belief in gods.<br>  <br>  How can I hate something that doesn't exist?<br>  <br>  As for Christians, I don't hate them but challenge their attempts to control my life with their narrow minded world view. I dislike them trying to infiltrate their religion into schools and government.<br>  <br>  Leave me alone and I'll leave you alone. Until then you have a big fight on your hands which you seem to be losing rather rapidly.|`|hiCSVwchaa	I have no hate for either god or Christians.<br>  <br>  (Though, while I don't believe in the Abrahamic god, Christians do exist...)<br>  <br>  I merely think some fundamentalist Christians are trying to pervert the US Constitution and laws.|`|wwdllMzYaa	experience os the same for 2000 years from christians has left a hostility towards them and towars the religion<br>  <br>  you dont hate the beleif, you hate the religion and its attitude and treatment of others<br>  and that is very easy and possible to hate|`|AA11058044	There's no atheist animosity towards God - it's all for the delusional folk who claim to be His followers.<br>  <br>  And I don't think there's anyone that can argue that Christians don't exist.|`|yHfsHp6naa	I don't hate anyone, certainly not a non-existent being. I have absolutely no respect for the christian religion, however.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	Psychologically speaking I think it is highly likely that a number of Atheists are former believers.  They feel abused or abandoned by their former faith, so they act in a hostile manner to people who still espouse what they have chosen to reject.<br>  <br>  Personally, as an Agnostic I don't feel any animosity to those who practice their faith in a peaceable manner.  Those people who feel a need to harm others in the name of their faith I have no problem with taking to task.  <br>  <br>  However, I do put up with a fair amount of aggressive discussion.  People on all sides are passionate about what they believe, and engaging in heated, yet serious discussion is acceptable to me.  When the exchange of ideas stops and the hurling of hateful insults begins, then I politely step aside and let the ignorant show their true colors.  This includes calling someones deity by blasphemous names, and telling people they are going to burn in hell for not doing what you say is right.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	Think about how most people feel about Islamic terrorists. Is that because they hate Allah or believe in it or because they dislike the way some of the people behave and try to impose their faith based on their religion? I don't think you have to believe in Allah or Yahweh to have problems with the way some Christians push their faith, or try to impose it on others, or behave ignorantly or intolerantly.|`|1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	I do not believe all atheists hate God and Christians.<br>  <br>  First, since we do not believe God exists, we really cannot hate God.<br>  <br>  Second, I for one do not hate Christians.  I have family members and friends who are Christians.  I accept all people regardless of their religious beliefs...|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Where are you getting the idea we do hate God? You said it yourself, how can we hate what we don't believe in?<br>  <br>  I don't hate Christians, I hate ignorance. SOmetimes I see a lot of that from Christians here. My anger is not at them as a Christian, it is at them for being dumb or for being a jackass.|`|W0qNkROpaa	You answered your own question.  How can you hate something you don't believe in?  Atheists don't hate God, they don't believe God even exists.  As for Christians, some atheists have a problem with the way that some Christians are pushy about their beliefs.|`|2567c53ea5be1f53420408d56fd5f4b4aa	I do not hate Christians, and I certainly don't hate imaginary people like god and Jesus. Methinks you may have a persecution complex.|`|ni6SCUm9aa	The people who do do that are usually just bored (that would be why they are on the internet - most atheists who do this on the internet are perfectly normal in real life).|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	Thank the fundies for that.|`|AA11946554	Many atheists don't believe there is a God-the anger is directed at Christians. It's the human (Christian) that does whatever and then to know it is based on an incorrect belief. It's infuriating.<br>  I realize there are a few 'atheists' that seem to 'hate' God...they mostly seem to be ex-Catholics who've had some horrible experience in their past that's turned them so much. <br>  To me, atheism is simply a REALIZATION that there's no mono-deity. I haven't had an exactly 'peachy-keen' existence and reading the Bible (to defend it) was what finally made me realize how useless and false it was. Reality made me see that a mono-theistic conclusion was unnatural and the lack of proof of any spiritual involvement has left me leaning in the atheistic direction.<br>  But then, a Christian (again, a human) will say something that makes me angry. I feel that I do not 'hate' any of them. But that depends on the definition of the word. I have no respect, only tolerance, for that religion.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	First, I am an atheist who sees hate as a sign of moral weakness and intellectual insecurity.<br>  <br>  Second, I was raised a Christian by good Christian people, and know many good Christian people.<br>  <br>  That said, I think in person it is usually a "Hate the sin and have contempt for the sinner" kind of thing:  Sin in this case being religion.  These are people who have been hurt by Christians and religion -- they see all Christians or all religious people as inflicting the same kind of pain.  For example, I am gay and there are many gay people who are very, very angry at Christianity for the way they were (and sometimes still are) treated by religious people.  This is particularly true for gay people who were rejected and abused by their religious parents, mostly, on religious grounds.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, some non-religious people are more than a little "evangelical" in their own right.  They see religion as bad/evil and want to end its influence in our society...sometimes by any means necessary.|`|AA10985791	Atheist don't hate 'god' because they don't believe in him/her.  However, there is wide spread bigotry and hatred spouted by so called supporters of all religions,  and bigotry, in all its forms is enough to rile the calmest of person. <br>  <br>  It difficult to put a point across when the only argument you get back is 'god told me, therefor I am right'  Like, HOW exactly did God tell you?<br>  <br>  Its organised religion that gets me, the organisers usually have some sort of higher ideal, that rooted in control and power, not love for their fellow man.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	We have never express hatred for Christians.  Most of the people I love are Christians.  I hate lies and religion is full of lies.  I hate ignorance and religion is rife with it.  God does not exist.  You can't hate something that is a figment of the imagination.  You are being judgmental and you don't even know it because you are so used to it.  You saying that we atheists hate God and Christians is a lying, judgmental statement.  It's not true.  Stop telling lies.  It would have been nicer if you asked us if we hated God and Christians, but for you to twist it and just state that we do is dishonest and wrong.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	I don't know myself, as I feel as you do. <br>  <br>  I don't believe in a God. So why waste time hating something I don't even think exists?<br>  <br>  But I have to ask for examples of the kinds of questions you speak of. <br>  <br>  I do that, because so many believers seem to have thin skins, and what I might find a perfectly reasonable, thoughtful question, some believers take as offensive. Same with many answers I've seen.<br>  <br>  I've even called the bluff of some who claim atheists never give "nice" answers. And they had to admit, that they just didn't like the answers, but none of them were particularly "mean" or "nasty".<br>  <br>  So I do think, that it's partly a matter of perception.<br>  <br>  I'm sure some will say it's in response to those believers who post nasty questions, that stereotype groups of people, or cast aspersions, or claim they know for sure how things are. Some have to deal with those kinds of things in their lives as well, and come here to vent.<br>  <br>  And let's be honest, it's a lot easier to be nasty or confrontational, when your not facing the person(s) your being nasty towards. So many, who might be a little more low key in everyday life, find a sort of "courage" to say extreme things.<br>  <br>  I'm sure some just do so to get a rise out of people as well.<br>  <br>  And then some people, believers or non-believers are just flat out immature.|`|f0JLp4hFaa	I'm frustrated by fundamental religions because:<br>  <br>  1) they teach us to stop asking questions about anything that might possibly contradict some book written by men 2000 years ago;<br>  <br>  2) I personally believe that the MASSIVE resources poured into religions worldwide could easily have paid for clean energy and greater food production had they been spent on science; and<br>  <br>  3) I believe religions separate us - they balkanize us, give us more dimensions to be different, give us more to disagree about, and contribute to greater hostility between groups.<br>  <br>  And to be clear, I see not the slightest difference between fundamentalists of any faith.|`|hYzfzu9yaa	I don't hate the concept of any gods, nor do I hate Christians. Disagreement is not hate. Debating is not hate. Questioning is not hate. Fighting back against unfair faith-based initiatives and laws is not hate. <br>  <br>  I hate some of the horrible things some Christians do in the name of their religion (such us trying to limit the rights of women and homosexuals). I hate that I actually have to fight for equality in my own country. I hate that some Christians think I don't even deserve to be considered a citizen or a patriot because I don't believe in their god (see: President Bush). I hate that I've lost a job because the school board felt my lack of god made me "questionable" and not suitable to teach art to students - even though I was the ONLY qualified volunteer in the entire school. I hate that when I tell a Christian door-knocker that I am an atheist, they decide this is an invitation to preach and leave literature at my door and return to  my home again and again when all I want is to be left alone. I hate that some people think my being an atheist means I must have no morals, that I kill and rape and steal and can't possibly live a fulfilling or good life - that I must be miserable and hate everything. I hate that some Christians think I must abuse my children, or that I am not fit to be their mother because I don't believe in any gods. <br>  <br>  I don't Christians. I don't hate any gods. But both cause me a great deal of grief.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Well, we don't hate god. As you note, we don't believe in it, so how can we possibly hate it?

Christ is his own father and his own son. The Holy Ghost is neither father nor son, but both. <br>  <br>  The son was begotten by the father, but existed before he was begotten--just the same before as after. Christ is just as old as his father, and the father is just as young as his son. <br>  <br>  The Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father and Son, but was equal to the Father and Son before he proceeded, that is to say, before he existed, but he is of the same age as the other two. <br>  <br>  So it is declared that the Father is God, and the Son and the Holy Ghost God, and these three Gods make one God. According to the celestial multiplication table, once one is three, and three time one is one, and according to heavenly subtraction if we take two from three, three are left. The addition is equally peculiar: if we add two to one we have but one. Each one equal to himself and to the other two. Nothing ever was, nothing ever can be more perfectly idiotic and absurd than the dogma of the Trinity."<br>  <br>  Amen!|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	It leans more toward myth than anything.|`|yvDzvIbBaa	id say it makes the religion look far less monotheistic than people claim it to be.|`|WalnRzfGaa	1+1+1=1<br>  <br>  makes no sense.<br>  <br>  they say that he is 3 in one, but that each part is separate and that there is only one God.<br>  <br>  <br>  its Rubbish|`|AA12203324	I'm not sure about "leaning".  The Christian scriptures are simply what they are.  There are occasional passages in the New Testament that describe up to three different types of divine interaction.  But as an offshoot of Judaism, Christianity must be nominally monotheistic.  The Trinity is about as practical an explanation as can be devised, although history has shown us that fervent, would-be Christians have not always agreed.

God says to choose who you will serve. This implies free will. The term "free will" the way you are referring to it does not appear in the Bible, but Christians are intelligent enough to understand complex ideas like reading between the lines.<br>  <br>  The term freewill offerings is present in the Bible, referring to offerings that are made to the Lord freely, for no other reason than love of the Lord. <br>  (e.g. All the Israelite men and women who were willing brought to the LORD freewill offerings for all the work the LORD through Moses had commanded them to do. Exodus 35:28-30)<br>  <br>  God offers salvation and life eternal, he does not force anyone to accept it. It is their own choice. The alternative is not particularly nice, but it is still personal choice. <br>  <br>  Be sure of this: The wicked will not go unpunished, but those who are righteous will go free.  Proverbs 11:20-22<br>  <br>  The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.  1 Corinthians 2:13-15|`|ehm3vCYXaa	The concept of "free will" is in the Bible. Though, not the words. It is referring to idea that God gives people the choice to believe in Him and follow His teachings, or to totally reject Him and suffer the consequences. Some Christians think that only certain people will be 'saved'.  They think of where the Apostle Paul says that "For those God foreknew, he also predestined to be confromed to he likeness of His Son,..." Some make the mistake of thinking that God only calls certain people.   John 3:16 says "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life" It didn't say whoever He chooses beforehand, it jus says "whoever". "Whoever" means whoever, it doesn't matter who you are what you look like, how much money you have or don't have...just if you believe you'll have eternal life.  He never coerces us into it.

JCGtfNeTaa	The wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23), not eternal life in hell. He who has the Son has life; he who hath not the son hath not life. (1 John 5:12) <br>  <br>  The destruction of the wicked (not the continuous torture) is called God's strange act. (Isaiah 28:21)<br>  <br>  Despite the popular belief about hell being in the center of the earth, or in some other dimensional plane of existence, and even though this is espoused by many in the Christian community, if you want the Bible's teaching on the matter, see Revelation 20:7-10 which says that:<br>  <br>  1) Hell does not yet exist today<br>  <br>  2) Hell will be on the surface of this planet<br>  <br>  Revelation 20:7-10:<br>  ---------------------------<br>  Now when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea. They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them. The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where[a] the beast and the false prophet are. And they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.<br>  ---------------------------<br>  <br>  Also contrary to popular belief, the fires of hell does not burn for all of eternity, but will burn, without interruption, until it has consumed all it has to burn. Then it will burn out, and this earth will then be recreated and thereby restored to its original state before sin entered it. (See Revelation chapter 20 and Isaiah 47:14)<br>  <br>  FYI, there are several examples in the Bible where the word "forever" or "unquenchable" refer to events that have already ended. For example:<br>  <br>  1 Samuel 1:22 says that Samuel would serve in the temple forever, but he is not serving there today, for he is dead.<br>  <br>  Jonah 2:6 - "I descended to the roots of the mountains. The earth with its bars was around me forever, ..." but Jonah is not still there in the fish.<br>  <br>  Jude 1:7 says Sodom and Gomorrah suffered the vengeance of eternal fire, but those two cities are not still burning yet today (they were located where the Dead Sea is today). The Greek word that was translated into our English word "eternal" means that it could not be put out until it had consumed everything that it was burning. All too often, people today try to redefine what the Hebrew or Greek words mean by our definitions today. But context is important, and the Bible, as with any and all writings whether ancient or modern, must be read and understood in its context and in its intended meaning. We must not pour our own meaning into anyone else's work.<br>  <br>  Those who reject the free gift of life will not spend all of eternity in hell being tormented, for eternal life is not given to those who reject it, but to only those who accept the gift.<br>  <br>  It was Satan that said, "You will not surely die" (Genesis 3:1-4) in contrary to what God had said in Genesis 2:17 - "for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die". If the phrase "you shall surely die" was literally translated it would read, "dying you shall die" -- in other words, God was not saying Adam and Eve would die that very day, but that they would die because of it.<br>  <br>  But as I said, it was Satan who said, "You will not surely die". Sadly, many in the Christian community perpetuate this lie still today, claiming that when you die, you don't surely die but go to either heaven or hell. The Bible is clear, the soul who sins shall die (Ezekiel 18:20)<br>  <br>  The Bible clearly teaches that we are not immortal, that only God is immortal (1 Timothy 6:15-16), and that we will be given immortality at Jesus second coming 1 Corinthians 15:53 says, "For this mortal must put on immortality...", so if we are already immortal, why must we put on immortality?! We are not immortal.<br>  <br>  The Bible clearly teaches that the lost will die, not live eternally and miserably. (Malachi 4:1-6; Isaiah 47:14; 1 John 5:11-12) To teach that the lost will suffer eternal conscious torment for all of eternity is to claim that they too have eternal life, something that the Bible clearly teaches the opposite of!|`|iHDYncuXaa	Hell is eternity, just as Heaven is....<br>  <br>  Following are a few verses that show the eternality of the hell and punishment.  God uses different phrases to describe the same thing.<br>  <br>  "And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power," (2 Thess. 1:9). <br>  "Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example, in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire" (Jude 7). <br>  These men are those who are hidden reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you without fear, caring for themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, doubly dead, uprooted; 13 wild waves of the sea, casting up their own shame like foam; wandering stars, for whom the black darkness has been reserved forever," (Jude12-13).|`|AA12193600	What is true is that after a few decades in heaven of xtians being on their knees hossanahing and praising 24/7 and seeing the rest of eternity unfolding in such a fashion--the horror you will see on the xtians face is the final understanding of the true nature of hell.|`|PDwlIrtsaa	I dont think so either, revenge is a human problem, God did not creat us so he could send us off to hell, we couldn't even do that to our own children nomater how bad they were, I believe in Christ as my savior but I think there are many different paths to God, I believe in reincarnation, it makes so much more since that God would teach us through many lives rather than send us to suffer torment forever in a lake of fire, that just sounds so childish, God is so much bigger than that.

Jesus Christ associated fire with Gehenna (Mt 5:22; 18:9; Mr 9:47,?48), as did the disciple James, the only Biblical writer besides Matthew, Mark, and Luke to use the word. (Jas 3:6) Some commentators endeavor to link such fiery characteristic of Gehenna with the burning of human sacrifices that was carried on prior to Josiah’s reign and, on this basis, hold that Gehenna was used by Jesus as a symbol of everlasting torment. However, since Jehovah God expressed repugnance for such practice, saying that it was “a thing that I had not commanded and that had not come up into my heart” (Jer 7:31; 32:35), it seems most unlikely that God’s Son, in discussing divine judgment, would make such idolatrous practice the basis for the symbolic meaning of Gehenna. It may be noted that God prophetically decreed that the Valley of Hinnom would serve as a place for mass disposal of dead bodies rather than for the torture of live victims. (Jer 7:32,?33; 19:2, 6, 7, 10,?11) Thus, at Jeremiah 31:40 the reference to “the low plain of the carcasses and of the fatty ashes” is generally accepted as designating the Valley of Hinnom, and a gate known as “the Gate of the Ash-heaps” evidently opened out onto the eastern extremity of the valley at its juncture with the ravine of the Kidron. (Ne 3:13,?14) It seems obvious that such “carcasses” and “fatty ashes” are not related to the human sacrifices made there under Ahaz and Manasseh, since any bodies so offered would doubtless be viewed by the idolaters as “sacred” and would not be left lying in the valley.<br>  Therefore, the Biblical evidence concerning Gehenna generally parallels the traditional view presented by rabbinic and other sources. That view is that the Valley of Hinnom was used as a place for the disposal of waste matter from the city of  Jerusalem. (At Mt 5:30 Ph renders ge′en·na as “rubbish heap.”) Concerning “Gehinnom,” the Jewish commentator David Kimhi (1160-1235?), in his comment on Psalm 27:13, gives the following historical information: “And it is a place in the land adjoining Jerusalem, and it is a loathsome place, and they throw there unclean things and carcasses. Also there was a continual fire there to burn the unclean things and the bones of the carcasses. Hence, the judgment of the wicked ones is called parabolically Gehinnom.”<br>  Symbolic of Complete Destruction. It is evident that Jesus used Gehenna as representative of utter destruction resulting from adverse judgment by God, hence with no resurrection to life as a soul being possible. (Mt 10:28; Lu 12:4,?5) The scribes and Pharisees as a wicked class were denounced as ‘subjects for Gehenna.’ (Mt 23:13-15,?33) To avoid such destruction, Jesus’ followers were to get rid of anything causing spiritual stumbling, the ‘cutting off of a hand or foot’ and the ‘tearing out of an eye’ figuratively representing their deadening of these body members with reference to sin.—Mt 18:9; Mr 9:43-47; Col 3:5; compare Mt 5:27-30.<br>  Jesus also apparently alluded to Isaiah 66:24 in describing Gehenna as a place “where their maggot does not die and the fire is not put out.” (Mr 9:47,?48) That the symbolic picture here is not one of torture but, rather, of complete destruction is evident from the fact that the Isaiah text dealt, not with persons who were alive, but with “the carcasses of the men that were transgressing” against God. If, as the available evidence indicates, the Valley of Hinnom was a place for the disposal of garbage and carcasses, fire, perhaps increased in intensity by the addition of sulfur (compare Isa 30:33), would be the only suitable means to eliminate such refuse. Where the fire did not reach, worms, or maggots, would breed, consuming anything not destroyed by the fire. On this basis, Jesus’ words would mean that the destructive effect of God’s adverse judgment would not cease until complete destruction was attained.<br>  Figurative Use. The disciple James’ use of the word “Gehenna” shows that an unruly tongue is itself a world of unrighteousness and that one’s whole round of living can be affected by fiery words that defile the speaker’s body. The tongue of such a one, “full of death-dealing poison” and so giving evidence of a bad heart condition, can cause the user to be sentenced by God to go to the symbolic Gehenna.—Jas 3:6,?8; compare Mt 12:37; Ps 5:9; 140:3; Ro 3:13.<br>  The Biblical use of Gehenna as a symbol corresponds to that of “the lake of fire” in the book of Revelation|`|OKClYfDQaa	Don, it's not the question of where you're; the real question is...WHOM are you with -- wherever you may be.|`|WalnRzfGaa	An all loving and forgiving God would not allow what he loves to be in hell at all.<br>  <br>  it is total BS.|`|b23e3ca87d32dda5732ada9427cb2644aa	Were saved through Jesus people choose hell by rejecting to follow God through alot of ways which wiould taske to long to mention.

If Adam had not sinned with his wife Eve they would still be alive today. Romans 5:12 tells us about why we die.<br>   Heaven is reserved for the government of Gods kingdom. Revelation chapter 7 talks about that. Daniel 2:44 a prophesy that will happen soon.<br>  Thy Kingdom come thy will be done ON EARTH> Jesus himself said in the sermon on the mount that "the meek will inherit the earth. In Psalms 37:8-11 it talks about the time when man kinds violent world will be replaced by peace on earth forever. You must exercises faith in the ransom sacrifice and take in knowledge of the only true God to receive these blessings. John 17:3<br>  <br>  As far as the teaching of hell it is misinterpreted. Hell is the common grave of mankind. Sheol in the hebrew scriptures and Hades in the greek scriptures. You do not go to a place of torment for ever. God is a God of love. 1 JOHN 4:8 He does not want you to fear him because of that concept that was taught in the fourth century to scare people to go to church. If you have children are you going to punish them forever because they disobeyed you for something? Of coarse not. If you did that you would go to jail and maybe loose your kid/s. Common sense yes. Hell is not HOT. It simply means that you would loose out on the chance of everlasting life because you choose not to obey Gods commands. Its your decision. Don't worry about torment.<br>  Reach out and get to know God by studying the bible and finding out about him and his purposes. John17:3

If they act all "Ohhh, it was a joke, it was nothing", then tell them firmly "No, it was no joke. I will not be your friend if you don't stop."<br>  <br>  If it doesn't stop immediately, get people involved. Police officers, parents, counselors, school principles, locksmiths... Anyone who can help.<br>  <br>  They are not acting appropriate. If they wanted to be your friend and if they really cared about you, they would not invade your personal space like that.

AA11984147	In the mid-80's the Neo-Nazi skinheads appeared in the United States. They had about 1,000 to 1,500 members by 1988 and around 3,400 by 1993 in forty states. With this growth in membership they have committed more violent crimes and have gone from using boots, bats and knives to using firearms. Only German skinheads have been able to match the United States skinheads in their frequent and ferocious attacks. From 1987 to 1990 there were only six killings by skinheads but from 1990 to 1993 there were more than 22 murders. <br>  <br>  Skinheads target minority groups like Hispanics, Blacks, Asians, homosexuals and homeless people. They will even attack another skinhead for clothes, money or just because they did not like how the other skinhead acted. The racist skinheads also have a special war cry, RAHOWA that stands for Racial Holy War. Since they do not keep close ties with any location they are free to move to a new location to avoid law enforcement officials. This is one reason it is difficult to determine just how many exist and where. Some often go 'underground'.|`|2xaVpnNNaa	there are too many neo nazi skinheads....(it may not honestly be much) but 1, is already 1 too many.<br>  <br>  as for the anti racist skinheads....i was seriously amazed to find out such existed...never met one though....dont know much about them.|`|r1BycC7Xaa	We don't get too many of those where I come from.

They grow up and realize they're making themselves virtually unemployable by wearing their bigotry on their sleeves, so they go all "ninja" on us and hide it. You can see what they turn into when they "grow up" - ok, wrong term, let's use "age a bit" - if you want. They're not hard to find. I watch the bastiches like a hawk. Their biggest online meeting place is Stormfront.org and they like whining about how the race war they've  so been looking forward to hasn't started yet. Pretty pathetic if you ask me. I wouldn't go there unless you have a very high tolerance for a combination of stupid, angst and quasi-intellectualism with a massive dose of absolutely horrific insults directed at anyone who is not a white christian or follower of one of the traditional germanic faiths. (and even they fight sometimes) I kinda *have* to watch them. You can probably guess how much that just  thrills me. No wonder  I'm so scrawny - I'm constantly nauseated and it ain't my cooking or the coffee.<br>  <br>  The anti-racist skinheads also tend to be young, and they're a hoot, I think. I've had to educate a couple in my area about my religious symbols so they would actually understand I'm not a chelsea, but once they "get it", they're kinda cute in a goofy, awkward way.

25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	I kinda take offense at the gossip part of your question *smile*, but I think I can answer the other part. I'm at an age where I'm seeing more and more of my friends having health problems. It seems that once the doctors find one thing wrong, they just keep on and on and on......so, the persons life is essentially revolving around doctor appointments and picking up prescriptions or going to therapy or whatever, so that's all they have going on in their lives to talk about. I sometimes think some of the meds that are prescribed contribute to the person thinking about their ailments to the point of being consumed by their health problems. It's sad and I've noticed it more with friends that have suffered some sort of injury that has changed their life drastically and they are in a lot of pain and taking pain meds (too many in my opinion).|`|iTEf1dP3aa	I know what you mean, I had a "friend" that something was always wrong with her or something was always hurting...everyday!!! so negative..it kinda seemed like "Whoa is me...." to me... and as far as gossip, i can't stand that....so annoying...my  mother is that way.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Some people love to dwell on the negative.

u48Wzj3yaa	You start by assuming something had to create the universe, but fail to realize you, in the same way, cannot explain where your god came from.|`|yZXe2XLlaa	Where I get to say "I don't know" is where you get to say "Goddidit"<br>  <br>  <br>  Detente.|`|25Cu0kjFaa	From what we understand, the universe started as a singularity. That became unstable, and expanded rapidly. We can accurately model the Big Bang down to the first few nanoseconds after the expansion began. Before that, physics as we know it doesn't work. But, we're working on it.<br>  <br>  What caused that singularity is a matter of much discussion. I like the theory that we're inside a black hole that exists in another universe. That universe is inside yet another black hole, and all of reality is a writhing mass of black holes - forming, evaporating, and linking universes. Amazingly enough, the math for this works if you make a couple of assumptions about the conditions around the expansion.|`|LF2t9DPZaa	Who says anything did?<br>  <br>  You say that "there had to be some force that made the very beginning of everything", but you don't provide any evidence or argument to support that conclusion. You assume that there had to be such a force because you believe there was one. That's called "begging the question", and it completely invalidates your argument.|`|HBp5r76haa	You'd be surprised what they can come up with..<br>  <br>  I heard them all: seeds from space, gases spontanously forming cells, etc.<br>  When you challenge them further, like: who created the first "matter" that from inanimate became living creatures, they said: it has always been there...<br>  A bit like God, then.....

By admitting "I don't know", you can then freely hypothesize, collect supporting information, investigate, etc.  Or, just continue to say 'I don't know".  <br>  <br>  FWIW, matter and anti-matter can spontaneously generate from nothing.  In fact, it happens all the time, but doesn't last long, as the matter and anti-matter come back together and destroy each other.  There are many potentially valid scientific theories of how the 'big bang' formed, however we really don't yet have much information to support them.<br>  <br>  To believe it was caused by an invisible supernatural deity- requires a huge leap of faith without any supporting information.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	Who says there was a very, very, very, first thing?<br>  <br>  Neither logic nor science demand it and many people, including me, don't think it is important -- assuming you are believer...I think you will find that you really don't think it is important either.<br>  <br>  What do I mean?<br>  <br>  Let me rephrase your question this way:<br>  <br>  If God created the beginning, who created God?|`|ZOsdAyrjaa	...who's to say God didn't create the beginning? If the physical realm as we know it didn't exist, at all (which many scientists are beginning to accept), there had to be something outside of it... according to Christianity, that thing, or "Prime Mover" (cause and effect) is God.|`|QCWPulqqaa	Why is it that the first "thing" had to come from "something", but you're perfectly ok in accepting that God came from nothing?

It is like and ant waving his fists up at you as you look down on it from a dizzy height is denial. Jeez, just one stomp of your foot and its gone!

Whatever the minds of men can imagine already exists. Since men can imagine Infinity, it exists, but the key is, men cannot understand all their imaginings. What one misses is that with the concept and possibility of Infinity, which does exists,  is impossible for us to understand because our life and mental capabilities fall short of the task.  The human race is new on the scene, and the gaining of knowledge has only begun.|`|oQx1sjfFaa	Well, the big bang did not create something from nothing. It's not like there was just some big explosion out of no where, there had to be something to explode. And time as we know it would not have existed then, as time is relative in several ways so I'm not sure 'first' is even appropriate as it implies a relative linear progression of events.<br>  <br>  A question for you to ponder might be what set off the big bang? Or, on a more spiritual side, if something needs another force to create it, then where did god come from? And, if god did indeed create the universe (perhaps through the big bang if you like) then what did he make it out of? Was it just, 'let there be' and there was or was there more to it than that?|`|C42YeDPuaa	My toilet is leaking.  There's a small crack under the reservoir.  That crack exists.  Who created it?<br>  <br>  The universe did NOT come from NOTHING.  The universe existed 13.7 billion years ago as a quantum singularity.  All the matter of the universe was contained in that singularity.  Then suddenly there was a rapid expansion.  Who caused that expansion?  Probably the same thing that caused the crack in my toilet.<br>  <br>  Besides, even if this atheist were to concede that the universe had to have an intelligent creator, how do you make the leap that the creator of the universe is also the god of Abraham?  That's kind of like, "The guy in the apartment next door knows a lot about computers.  He must be Bill Gates!"|`|htQrkD8waa	no- its easy to put to words-<br>  <br>  you just did.<br>  <br>  here is your answer:<br>  <br>  WE DON'T KNOW.<br>  <br>  but i would rather say "i don't know, modern science is working on that"<br>  <br>  than any number of made up things like:<br>  <br>  "superman had a game of chinese checkers with the justice league and farted and burped ice breath at the same time and the universe was born"<br>  <br>  "we are actually not alive, but a video recording like internet that some one else is watching"<br>  <br>  "the universe is a series of "heat build up" explosions resulting from a giant black hole"<br>  <br>  "we came from another dimension and like a rubber band keep slinging back and forth".<br>  <br>  "some "thing" that existed before that somehow was immune to space and time and always was and never was created by anything but was supremely powerfull "just becasue" created the universe"<br>  <br>  ANY of those are just as legitimate as the god idea. since there is no proof for either, so what do you want, ridiculous answers or ACCURATE answers.|`|c85dfb73b5d99dcbc373b5a788901bc7aa	This is really a question that cannot be answered by human beings at our present level of development.

And:<br>  <br>   Look that sun that has been burning controlled for at least 6000yrs.,365 days a year, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, never exploding or sending off a huge solar flare propelling it at us or out of orbit.<br>  Or those clouds that can pick up enough water to flood an entire state. Why do they pick it up? do they have any use for it other than just for the most part gently sprinkling it on the vegetation that we rely on for oxygen. And keeping the land from drying up and blowing away. You should be well aware that a 20ft. x 20ft. x 1in. deep pond of water weighs approx. 2000lbs. <br>  To me that is very impressive to say the least. ? ? ? ?|`|jEvEYr5daa	First of all, I am curious whether your a Christian?  <br>  <br>  But to answer your question, the Big Bang does not answer what began first, it simply answers how the universe began.<br>  <br>  -Second, the god explaination is not an answer at all because god is suppose to be eternal and unexplainable.  If you think about this, this is the same exact idea as saying that the universe is eternal and that all matter in the universe was always here and always will be here.  Except instead of that, you have an entity that has always been here rather than an object.  So the idea of god and that everything came from nothing, are essentially the same explanations which in the end take you no where.<br>  <br>  -Third, I know that the idea of existence is a complicated one and the answer we may never figure out.  However, just because we may never know the answer to the origin of the universe, does not mean that we should ignore it and simply replace the question mark with an even bigger question mark.  Saying that god does not need an explanation is like saying that the universe does not need an explanation.  Where did God come from?  This is an important question.|`|niYixDU4aa	god did create the beginning.<br>  <br>  <br>  big bang?  ok what created the star?  gases?  what created that...and on and on.<br>  <br>  <br>  what created god?  nothing he was just there and you have to believe and have faith.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  what do you have to loose?  might as well worship god whether he's real or not...then if he is real you get to laugh in everyones faces when they burn in hell. :D<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  lol jk about the last part.|`|AA11718880	I did it.

Both were at fault when it came to this fight. But I think the reason why society says it unacceptable for a man to hit a woman is because usually the woman is smaller than the man. I mean if a man is 6'0 tall and weighed 200 lbs and his girlfriend was 5'2 and weighed 115 lbs of course he would cause more bodily harm to her than she would.|`|d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	Because we put up with your crap for hundreds of years.

16JTMgKpaa	Ignore jealous females. They will always be around and try to make you feel as little as they feel. Just ignore them, I mean- avoid at all costs. Dont even take the same route. Dont even give them eye-contact. I wish i had this advice as a teen- I would have not let them get to me. If one tries to start a fight, just walk off- leave her standing there. You dont need to stoop to their level, let your inner confidence shine. Being quiet is much more powerful.|`|ifZQdkWgaa	I think confidence starts from within the household no matter what race or ethnicity you are. If you are sure of who you are and what you believe in then theirs not room for lack of confidence & once confidence is built then jealousy builds but that same thing that makes you feel good is that same thing that makes you not care what others think and builds more to your character. I hope this helped and just be you you don't have to be from a black or Hispanic background to feel confidence! ;)|`|hUyIeCVlaa	Buzz Killington's answer was BS, most Spanish girls (pale ones at least) have flat butts. I have seen many southern White girls with big butts and some Asian girls out west with Nice butts.<br>  <br>  Now to address your answer, it is society pressure. As much as I hate Britney's answer, being from the "ghetto" puts more pressure on a girl to look good and be more confident and to lose their ability to be "shy". The guys in the ghetto want the best girl out of the group and the strongest guy will typically try to get and try to protect the best looking girl, a lot of the girls cannot act shy that way. Honestly, I prefer the Blond Hair Blue Eyed chick over a Spanish Brunette with pale Skin.|`|visr6RRQaa	Our parents know that life is going to be tougher on us (at least in the US) than some other nationalities because of stereotypes and racism so they instill pride and confidence in us in an early age to combat the abuse before it happens.

Participate in activites that will allow you to help other people as well as yourself.  Be a giver - always be ready to assist someone.  In my way of thinking, self confidence is never about the body parts - that would make you shallow - but rather about your love for others and what you can do to 'serve' others (do something positive in your community and neighborhood, for the elderly, the small children, the homeless, the poor.)  <br>  <br>  People are all consumed about themselves and what they can get out of other people instead of the other way around.  I believe your smile and the way you carry yourself will have others wanting to 'do' like you.  Not 'be' like you.<br>  <br>  It's all about PASSING IT FORWARD - every positive thing you learn and do and can be - PASS IT FORWARD.|`|xWGJHMkuaa	It's all about the booty.<br>  <br>  Notice the one thing most have in common...a great ***.|`|6ac013da2dceabac6383ebdee4f828c0aa	You don't need a tan or a great azz to be confident.  Almost every woman has something great about them--oftentimes, more than one great thing.  Decide what your assets are and work them.  Do you have beautiful eyes?  Find out what makeup makes them pop.  Great smile?  Use a shiny lipgloss.  Wear colors that look good on you.  Keep your hair, nails and eyebrows maintained.  Yes, these are little things, but they make a big difference.<br>  <br>  Feeling like you are the best thing ever is not being confident.  Be yourself, like yourself and be fun and kind to others.  That's all you really need to do.|`|0hsh000waa	That's a stereotype I've known many shy and insecure black and Spanish girls.<br>  <br>  You have to develop thick skin.

Try reading a book on assertiveness or go on Jeopardy.|`|UnG3dS7xaa	It's kept in a small pouch located in their finely rounded hindparts.|`|KF8CHY2faa	The key tool that anyone would have in relation to confidence is self-love. If you love yourself, there is nothing in this world that anyone can tell you about who you are as a person that would make you feel any less than 'perfect'. For you are created in the image of god, there for your are perfect. And let no one tell you otherwise. <br>  <br>  A positive self-image would add to your core strenghts with self confidence. You have to find things about yourself that you adore and capitalize on it. May it be your smile, your eyes, skin tone, size, or thighs; find the things about you that you're most proud of and project them. Wear clothing that complement your body type and find new ways to do your hair and make up. You have to be able to look at yourself in the mirror and see your true beauty. You have to tell yourself "you are beautiful, you are attractive". And you have to believe it when you hear these words being spoken, because what ever comes out of your mouth you're the first person to hear it. So if you speak words of beauty and encouragement you'll start to believe them. <br>  <br>  And last, you have to strut your stuff like it's no body's business girl! You have to walk to like your '$@!t don't stink". I'm serious, you have to act like no matter what those girls say about you or too you it means nothing to you, because they don't see what you see. And that's a beautiful person not only on the inside, but on the outside as well. Your friends are right, they are jelious of you, because they can see your beauty when you fail to see it yourself. It's not a black, white, or latino issue, but its an issue that women on all ends of the color spectrum deal with daily. You have to love you for you, because if you don't love you then no one else will.|`|Ps9eOIchaa	Well,i'm mixed with black and mexican,and i'm not exactly confident,but i'm not all down on myself<br>  <br>  Focus on the positive and not the negative.|`|pfke6Jieaa	most of them were shy. i would say black girls were a bit more outgoing but hispanic girls were mostly shy to approach anyone. i always had to approach them, in my experience.|`|Sv62SsxXaa	in response to the answers above:<br>  i dont have a big butt..or a tan..<br>  but im confident.<br>  its just how theyre raised, not their skin color and body shape. people are so ignorant.|`|z55dnFYZaa	"Where do black and spanish girls get THEIR confidence?"<br>  <br>  yep, you're definitely black or spanish|`|mdV0oXATaa	Thats quite stereotypical, some black and spanish girls are quite reserved i believe|`|crgI7ZR5aa	there spicy!!!!haha it comes from there soul there HAPPY be happy n be spiritual|`|l7jLuvFeaa	We need pics.

The surgery merely allows them to reflect their gender identity externally. <br>  <br>  There is no requirement to have SRS to be a transsexual, instead the requirement is that your physical body does not match the gender identity with which you identify.<br>  <br>  For example: I am a male bodied person. I view myself as male, I have always viewed myself as male. I am a man. I also am not a transsexual.<br>  <br>  Susan (not her real name) is a male bodied person. Susan has felt her entire life that she is a girl. While her physical body does not reflect that, it doesn't make it any less true. Susan is a transsexual.<br>  <br>  Mark (not his real name) is a female bodied person who has felt his entire life that he is a man. While mark has breasts, which he binds flat, and other characteristics of the female body, he is most definitely a man.

The problem is precisely that a significant number of Muslims have now a middle age mentality in that respect. <br>  But the main point, really, is that it is difficult to invoke Christian teachings to justify violence and intolerance, whereas it is very easy to use Islam as a justification for the same. Islam was born in a very violent environment and it clearly advocates the use of violence (even killing others) to defend Islam if this is "necessary". Of course it also preaches compassion, tolerance, etc. at the same time. But it leaves the door open for extremely violent "interpretations".

If you look, you can still find a number of Christians who try to interpret the bible in such a way that they justify similar acts of aggression against fellow human beings.|`|bCIpOU6taa	No.<br>  Those terrorist follow whatever they want and will end up in hell.<br>  I'm a Muslim, and on the contrary, the Koran tells us to treat other religions as you would treat any guest.

That leaves us with closed minds ... I would not like the prophet to see this bad fact...

In 4 weeks, they killed more than 1500 people and injured more than 5000 people; most of whom are women and children (see theuntoldtruth.wordpress.com). All of this while defying 2 UN resolutions and occupying land illegally. Thanks to the media, you do not hear that.<br>  <br>  Most of the shootings and murders happening in US are self inflicted by Christians.<br>  <br>  How about the genocide in Uganda? The Tamil tigers in Siri Lanka? etc, etc....<br>  <br>  Muslims situation has plenty of tribulations causing the uproar of Muslims world wide: see Iraq, see Palestine, see Kashmir, see Somalia.<br>  <br>  There are 1 plus billion Muslims in the world. The percentage of the so called terrorist will not exceed 0.1%.|`|pHKkWDAeaa	as far as know, the true islam religion does not encourage this.<br>  islam, like christianity, has branched off into different things and one person branches off and then he gets some followers then his followers get even more people, etc.|`|0c7afeab4d0a2cffaae3b6f595659888aa	Northern Ireland??

I believe they knew that you were destined to get somewhere and hoped they would get there first or thought that riding your coat tails would be beneficial for them. They saw that instead they could have done something themselves and became jealous.<br>  <br>  I really don't like using that word because it seems like the panacea for every crappy thing that someone does to another person, "they must be jealous!"<br>  <br>  It is the one of the worse things in life when a friend turns out to do or be worse than an enemy. Even when confronting the person, what can they say but either show their reptilian skin or deny anything strange ever happened like you temporarily lost your mind and didn't see what you saw or experience what you did or heard the vile language that you heard. Those kinds of people is what makes reality T.V. successful.<br>  <br>  If the truth be told, there is never a better friend than you can find in Jesus.|`|130df77840211884c0142ac3fabd5beeaa	one word: jealousy<br>  <br>  if they are jealous of you being successful, they never were your true friends to begin with. someone who truly cares about you would be your biggest fan when you get ahead in life. you need to hang out with people who will help you go forward, not drag you down. good luck and don't let all the jealous haters get to your head.|`|Rqt2DRzSaa	Then they were never really close to you.

jiMAtaCraa	Racism is a collectivist philosophy, but it does not remain one for long. The circle of who are deemed as "acceptable" shrinks further and further, until shriveling up to one common ideal. In that sense, Racism is for the betterment of one individual, and for the detriment of all else. Racism can be thought of as Whites vs Blacks. Let's assume Blacks are no longer in the equation. Who do Racist Whites turn to next? Those who are White of Southern Europe, as they are deemed of having "Black Blood". What happens when Southern Europeans are removed. Racist Whites turn their hatred to that of Brown-Haired and Red-haired individuals, as it is according to their beliefs that it is a sign of racial inferiority. The contraction of the idealistic individual further contracts, until finally excluding White Females,  White Homosexuals, White Disabled individuals among a wide list of many. <br>  <br>  Therefore, what can be ascertained and summed up as a conclusion is that the only way one can support Racism is if they are that "Ideal". Those who are not of the "Ideal" yet support such an erroneous philosophy have embarked on a serious ideological blunder. It is Social Darwinism at its best!|`|cfdaa128dfa2a07a157aa79c35d7f3abaa	It depends how you define being a racist.  If you keep racism to yourself, then it isn't too harmful, though it is really hard, if not impossible, to keep it to yourself.  When you hold views against people, they usually show.  You will be keeping your distance and saying things which are based on prejudice, even if the language you use is not prejudiced in and of itself.<br>  <br>  Open racism hurts others, and that is not a moral argument, but an ethical one, and has logical consequences.  Victims of discrimination are more likely to use drugs, more likely to skip work, more likely to commit crimes, more likely to attempt suicide, more likely to need assistance, and more likely to need mental health services.  These all drain our resources and can be avoided by treating all people as equals.<br>  <br>  People who are victimized or feel discriminated against become filled with resentment.  They may try to make others feel what they feel.  They may riot and protest.  They may tie up the court system.<br>  <br>  Open prejudice harms the ones who are prejudiced and others of their group.  If someone burns down a Black-owned buisiness, they might kill a few Whites in the process.  Someone trying to shoot someone of a race they don't like may miss them and hit you.<br>  <br>  Plus, being prejudiced robs you of the rich and full experience of being human and learning about cultures outside your own.|`|oqs6n07aaa	Well, I was going to say that racism will most likely secure a person's position in hell, but you  didn't want a moral reason.<br>  <br>  So how's this?<br>  <br>  Racism consists of hatred/bad feelings. Those emotions block happiness and make the hater feel crummy and angry constantly.<br>  <br>  This is why racists are intent on SEPARATION. If they could move to an area where they wouldn't have to see people they hate or hear about them, maybe they could forget about them after a while and be happier.<br>  <br>  Reality is a problem for racists because the races are NOT going to separate. You cannot put a race of people in one section of the country and forbid them from moving around.<br>  <br>  So racists in this country are forced to see different people on a daily basis. They get on the buses with them. They see them in films and TV and it just burns them up. They are very angry all the time.<br>  <br>  I have never EVER met one single happy racist.<br>  <br>  How's that?|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	What, moral reasons aren't good enough?<br>  <br>  There's no rational or scientific evidence to suggest one race is superior to another.

jYwSKzg1aa	Hah, I've personally been told by guys "Too bad you don't have blue eyes; they're so much more attractive on a blonde".  Some even went so far as to suggest I cover up the natural hazel green with color contacts.<br>  <br>  I believe it's due to media reinforcement of an outdated ideal.  I've noticed that for many years, most of the big stars of movie and tv had blue eyes.  Brown was ok for comic relief, but the blue-eyed guy always got the girl.  No accounting for taste -- I'd rather see a pair of big brown eyes than cold blue any day.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	o.o I have have never heard anyone say "Im infatuated with blue eyes" Yes blue eyes can be pretty but it's not more pretty than other eye colors. Maybe you have met some Americans who did love blue eyes but I have met a lot of Europeans who love brown eyes yet I don't assume it's all of them.|`|vcdhCiU6aa	People with blue eyes are more beautiful|`|4sh2oRR7aa	Because they are among the rarer eye colors (only dominated by green and gray is a shade of blue). It's not just America but pretty much every country. Blue eyes are bright and captivating and have always been a standard. Blue eyes tend to be lighter than what other eye colors are capable of achieving and bright/light eyes are a symbol of youth. Also Europe is a small population of the world and not even half of their population has blue eyes. In countries where there is a lot of racial mixing, blue eyes are often recessive thus making the trait rarer. Especially in places like America.|`|2xaVpnNNaa	well i just have a thing for eyes(and smiles) in general....but with blue eyes, there color is just mesmerizing....some can be soooo blue like an ocean.....just the different shades are amazing.|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	Dont think you will get an intelligent answer because your question is not intelligent.|`|eskZfVBkaa	They are? If they like them so much they should go to Poland.|`|GPznIhzMaa	Because blue is a prettier color than brown and gray. Blue makes you think of the ocean and clear skies. (Just my guess. I have brown eyes and I think I have pretty eyes.)|`|yS9a9jk5aa	Not all Americans, I like green eyes or dark brown eyes, blue is cool too (depending on the blue) and grey is amazing!|`|WBf2V8vSaa	I have ice blue eyes, and people always tell me they are gorgeous and trust me it gets annoying.|`|cLATPkjkaa	Well that's starting to change considerably.|`|ueKeUZ6oaa	Barbie.|`|9n4MpLwvaa	I don't know.<br>  <br>  I find my light brown eyes gorgeous.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh so gorgeous.|`|Dv5HiSSraa	I love blue eyes. White and blue are my favorite colors.|`|aM6252PMaa	I have green eyes and my brother has blue eyes. When we're out, random people are always making weird comments about my eyes and not his. Maybe this is just in the LA area, I don't know. But I get a lot of questions and he never really has. <br>  <br>  <br>  And I think people from outside of Europe and North America are actually more interested in colored eyes than Americans. I help teach English at my university to Korean and Japanese exchange students and they're always asking me about them. There's a Nigerian boy in my class who seems to be unhealthily attached to them, but he's a bit of an oddball, anyway. Haha.<br>  <br>  As far as rareity, I'm pretty sure it is brown-hazel-blue-green-gray. The only people I see with gray are from near the Baltic sea. And the only people I see with green are from far nothern and eastern Europe.|`|8szjUHdsaa	I think you're thinking of Americans of European descent.  I seldom hear brown folk praising this feature--of course, that doesn't necessarily mean that they dislike it either.|`|GInSlNYcaa	Maybe because 75% of America is of European descent. Plus blue eyes are the brightest and most noticeable of eye colors.|`|4eKo5nxkaa	I have blue eyes and no one is obsessed with my eyes.<br>  <br>  But blue eyes are the rarest.  That is why some people favor them.|`|DgsHQ47yaa	Blue eyes are beautiful.

bXdOfByeaa	God is everywhere, not in some brick building run by (possibly) shady people. I don't attend church, but I serve God with my heart and soul. Besides, a Church is made up of 2 or more people. You could sit down with a friend and worship God and still be at Church.|`|eLedl03Naa	Serve humanity instead, do something daily to challenge your prejudices such as read an article in a left of centre newspaper (not Janet Street Porter) and stop discriminating based on your 'instinct'.|`|aJLXBhoAaa	You can but your faith wouldn't get any stronger.|`|25qUTYLEaa	I am like that. I think about God 24/7, he is ALWAYS on my mind. But I usually get more spiritually when I'm worshiping Him at home than publicly in front of other people. I'm not knocking church, that's just my own experiences.|`|KILFoc6kaa	Your fellowship doesn't have to be in a church, it can be a group of people who get together for bible study, it can be online.<br>  <br>  Its good to have fellowship, and church is a convenient way to have it, however it is not the only way,|`|jBYxEX8taa	Yes. Your relationship with God is not based on how often you attend a building. But at least try to make an effort to attend if you can. It can help you grow in faith, teach and learn from others and make friends.|`|zMcHYQeBaa	That's what I do<br>  <br>  My Bible study is on my own and fellowship entirely on line. I feel as if God is pleased with that.<br>  <br>  Remember, God wants you to worship Him in spirit and truth. Church has nothing to do with that.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	The Bible says to "forsake not the gathering of yourselves together."  Thinking about God is not the same as "serving" him.  But if you can do His will and somehow be a witness, then it is still possible to be saved without ever attending any specific "church."|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	Yes, when you are in the service of your fellow man you are only in the service of your God.<br>  <br>  James 1:27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.|`|7sEFufRbaa	Absolutely, your relationship with God is between you and God.   Remember, that all religions were created by man and not by God.  God said come together not form hundreds of different religions then judge others and kill in his name.|`|uAMzmAwaaa	of course it is... though the Bible strongly recommends fellowship with other believers. so even though you don't go to church you could still have a bible study or something with your friends.|`|HbCWNCQzaa	well i don't go to church either but God is constantly on my mind and i believe that his son died for our sins and rose on the third day|`|MSWgVj4Maa	Yes, I mean he does not exist but leaving the church and thinking for yourself is a undeniable step in the right direction.|`|AM7cK4L9aa	Sure, but you miss out on the fellowship of other believers.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	The church is the community that Christ has established. There are no Lone Ranger Christians.|`|AA10920670	Historically, there were hermits and anchorites who dedicated their lives to prayer and penance. However, they were still affiliated with a church and gained formation (religious study) from it.<br>  <br>  The trouble today is that people think attending a worship service is all they need. They think that all formation was finished after Sunday School.<br>  <br>  Formation is a lifelong process. It is also sometimes an hourly process of conversion - from the people we are, to the people God hopes we will become by knowing Him.<br>  <br>  So too, there are people who think it is acceptable to use God as a weapon of their hatred and bigotries, even though the bible forbids it.|`|KRdA9iS2aa	It's not appropriate. Jesus Christ established the ministry because he cares people(life). He proclaimed as King because there was partisans. He is the leader because of the follower. They become one body because of one faith. God ask to worship in the Temple and Jesus recognized the place as his Father place. Jesus also speak in the Syn-ague where the temple was far in his place. In time of persecution the Christian met together in secret. why? <br>  ( Jesus teach us we should pray alone without people's approval)<br>  <br>  Do we need update about the good news? if we don't fellowship with them? How can we understand alone.<br>   <br>    It's better to go and fellowship with the group nice and friendly. And learned about their comment.<br>    <br>    The place they meet where they discussed ideas among the people.
RZetcwalaa	Doesnt suprise me in the slightest if its true.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	Hmm.  The Soviet Union, Red China, North Korea, Cuba....  yeah, I can see how they came up with their conclusions.<br>  <br>  peace|`|3qqvFEsHaa	It is a fact that non religious people are on average more educated/intelligent than religious people.<br>  <br>  Not really something to agree or disagree with|`|NXTpQSdhaa	If research found the above to be true then how can I agree or disagree? It is the conclusions drawn from it that will cause debate.<br>  <br>  And yes, I agree that atheism/agnosticism is on the increase in countries in Western Europe. However, Eastern European countries still have very high levels of Christianity (officially) like Romania - (around 95% Catholic)<br>  <br>  Survey/Census data is unreliable however. Many people tick the box they most identify with in terms of national identity (IE in the UK many who vaguely believe in "a" God will tick Christian because they associate it with Church of ENGLAND and yet do not believe anything in the Bible). Some do not give out their religious/spiritual beliefs at all. Some do not know what agnostic even means and yet may fall into that category.<br>  <br>  Do I think atheist are smarter than christians? Not necessarily but some of them will have examined the validity of the beliefs with a more open minded approach as they probably feel they are free to doubt without consequence.|`|pfNnuD5saa	So you are saying that being an atheist makes you superior?  That just because you are an atheist you are healthier, smarter and more moral. Don't you find that a bit simplistic?|`|AM7cK4L9aa	One can be too smart for their own good.|`|hii5wweQaa	yes.....|`|NmsBFeNJaa	It absolutely makes sense! <br>  So many people refuse medical help for themselves and/or children because they want to "leave it up to God". So many people refuse to do anything they can to work and provide for themselves and their children because they believe "the lord shall provide". So many people condemn women because of the role of eve and the traditional role of women as written in the bible, etc. Too many people believe that it is more important to be religious than to be educated, since religion will help them in heaven and education won't. People war in the name of God, judge others because of the bible, etc.<br>  This study makes sense. It really does!|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	How can you not agree with the results of the survey?  Afterall, these are correlations, that do not claim causations.

bXdOfByeaa	There is absolutely no Scientific proof that God does not exist. The theory of Evolution and the theory of Abiogenesis do not discredit a creator. Everything has a starting point, even if it is an endless cycle of starting points. So, absolutely. A scientist can believe in God.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Sure.  Lots of scientists believe in God.  They just don't take every teaching of their church (if they have one) as truth.|`|99hfFssXaa	oh yah|`|aJLXBhoAaa	Of course after all many of the major scientific branches were founded by Christian scientists not Atheists.<br>  Newton,Faraday,Maxwell,and Kelvin founded Physics<br>  Boyle,Dalton,and Ramsay founded Chemistry<br>  Ray,Linnaeus,Mendel,and Pasteur founded Biology<br>  Steno,Woodward,Brewster,and Agassiz founded Geology<br>  Kepler,Galileo,Herschel, and Maunder founded Astronomy<br>  All of men I mentioned are Creation scientists.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	No there were many of the older Scientists who believed in God.Newton appreciated that God is the Source of all truth, and in line with the deep reverence he had for his Creator, he appears to have spent even more time searching after the true God than he did in searching out scientific truths. An analysis of all that Newton wrote reveals that out of some 3,600,000 words only 1,000,000 were devoted to the sciences, whereas some 1,400,000 were on religious topics.Einstein said,"My religion consists of a humble admiration for the illimitable superior spirit who reveals Himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble minds.’Galileo and many others, many scientists today believe in God also.I can go on and on.You won't see this on R&S.|`|3qqvFEsHaa	yes its possible<br>  <br>  But they are in the minority|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	Of couse many do.|`|AA11297267	Yes, it's possible.<br>  And yes, it's hard for a good scientist to believe in god.<br>  That's because a good scientist understands the nature of evidence, and what evidence can and can't tell us.  Given the complete lack of evidence *for* any god, and the huge mountain of evidence that shows there's no such thing, a good scientist has a hard time ignoring that and believing anyway.  That's why something like 90% of scientists have no belief in god or are not religious.<br>  <br>  There are, of course, 10% that do believe in god -- so it's certainly possible.  Most such that I've met are more "deist" than anything else...they believe in a supreme intelligence, but not a god that is actually involved in human existence or its creation.  It's more a belief out of hope than out of evidence.<br>  <br>  There are no working scientists that I know of who are what we would call "fundamentalist christians" -- those that believe in a 6,000 year-old earth or that god created the planet and adam and eve whole and intact.  That supposition is so soundly proven wrong that no real scientist can possibly accept it and still work in science.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|hiCSVwchaa	A scientist can believe in god.  Nothing in science denies the existence of a higher being.<br>  <br>  ETA:  Chris S, Einstein was a pantheist, which is not something most Christians would necessarily consider "believing in god."|`|IhzeHAx4aa	Absolutely:<br>  <br>  Sir Issac Newton: Physicist, inventor of calculus<br>  Nicolas Copernicus: Developer of the Sun Centered Model of the Solar System<br>  Blaise Pascal: Mathematician<br>  Francis Crick: Co-discoverer of DNA<br>  <br>  just to name a few|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	Many do, although they don't always publicize the fact.<br>  The more intimately familiar they are with Creation, the more likely.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Yes and some prominent scientists still believe in God. My family friends down he block are currently working on the next Mars project and are practicing, believing Jews.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	Many do.  They are so amazed at the knowledge that they discover that they come to the realization that things just didn't happen by themselves|`|oojO4WAraa	Sure some of them do believe in god.  I would think it might be difficult for most of them to believe though.|`|a7fc3089d9e7ba174faf16c6aa239694aa	Very.|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	I do.  I am an engineer and I believe in God and evolution.  I think the Bible is metaphoric, not literal.  I also believe in global warming, not as something caused by humans but as part of the natural heating and cooling of the earth that has been happening in cycles since the creation of our planet.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	yes they can believe in God and many do<br>  <br>  others totally deny it or give in to peer pressure knowing that if they do believe in God they will be laughed out of the scientific community and none of their work will be taken seriously.|`|xUXpfKyIaa	Ken Miller.  Biology professor who opposes creationism.  Oh yeah, he is a Roman Catholic.|`|I54FE7iSaa	Yes, but there's got to be a anti-scientific bit to them to.<br>  It's not uncommon for someone to be very logical in some ways and very stupid in others.|`|N0iM1mo8aa	Absolutely.  There are many scientists who believe in God and some have even used their scientific curiosity to prove God's existence.|`|AM7cK4L9aa	Absolutely. Requires a discerning ability between the physical and the spiritual.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Yes.  The example I always give is the physicist who originally came up with the big bang theory.  He was also a Roman Catholic priest.|`|G49lKR56aa	Scientist do believe and have proven that God exist!

There are many scientists who believe that science proves Gods existence more.|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	sure, many scientists do believe in God. Most dont, but some do.|`|2ogimlBxaa	Some do. The guy who worked on the Human Genome project does.|`|wK85ZvOMaa	Yes they can.|`|zhk8o514aa	Sure, I do.|`|2nqmoerIaa	yes they can<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Dom K|`|hzQDocWaaa	yes|`|ZAQCvcIyaa	I think it would be completely ignorant as a scientist to believe in god because the whole point behind science is finding a scientific reasoning behind everything. Anything can be explained by science. We should be more concerned about theorys like the big bang theory  instead of believe a book (the bible), because it is nothing more than that. Just a story.|`|1Te4sfqIaa	Certainly!  However it is not possible for a true scientist to allow his belief in god to affect his work.  Scientists seek to understand how the Natural world works.  Since god is Supernatural and supposedly beyond our understanding, he has no place in a scientists career.  As for his personal life he can believe what he wants.|`|PFzqpxQ7aa	There are a minority of scientists who believe in god but those are the ones conducting research such as<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/hscout/2009/03/08/hscout624661.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.forbes.com/feeds/hscout/2009/...</a>|`|JWNzoksmaa	no not at all...i believe science makes it even more prevalent that there is God.  The fact that a Single celled organism...in it's simplicity it's soo very complicated...can have spawned everything we now see, feel and hear is just proof that there is God.  Only a god could have made something so simply complicate.  Get what i'm saying.  Only God could have come up with our Ozone Layer, only God could have created our moon so our oceans, seas and rivers flow, only God could create the cycle system of Perception.  All this stuff is so obvious and so simple in it's way....but the process in so very complicated.  Get what i'm saying. <br>  <br>  Science only proves that God does exists.

The world's view is that "it's OK, it's who I am" or "I was born in the wrong body" or "I'm not hurting anyone"... the world's view is to say that evil is good.  The Lord has been clear on the subject.  Man and woman are meant to marry and be help meets for eachother.  Being involved in homosexual acts destroys the eternal plan our Heavenly Father has in store for us - the highest which is exaltation, and one can only gain that with their spouse.  <br>  <br>  My opinion is that the world is going to get increasingly sinful, but say "it's OK."

It's fine.  It gets me where I need to go.  It's dependable, and I like it.  But sex with women (particularly with my wife) is like driving the Camaro I had in college.  It gets my heart racing in a way that SUV never will.  It's super-hot, super-exciting, and it MORE than gets me where I want to go.

yQNit56Qaa	1) well what does God say about practicing Christians dating Catholics?<br>  <br>  He says that Catholics are Christians too (v 26)<br>  <a href="http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.php3?do=jump_to_chapter&refstr=Acts+11%3A26&trans=NASB" rel="nofollow">http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.p...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  It seems that there is some uncertainty regarding what your parents consider a "practicing Christian".  Naturally, the label "Catholic" does not automatically make someone a practicing Christian.  For example, if he's a "twice-a-year" Catholic (church on Christmas and Easter only, whether he needs it or not), that's not exactly a "practicing Christian".<br>  <br>  Ask your parents (if you are unsure, as it seems) what is required for them to consider someone a "practicing Christian".

How can you possibly not get that?|`|QCWPulqqaa	Why do christians always think that catholics are not christians???  Do you not know that the definition of Christian is someone who accepts Jesus as the son of god and their savior?  That's it.  Usually, people who call themselves christians are part of a religion that broke off of Catholicism years ago because they didn't want to follow the catholic rules (protestant usually).  God hasn't said that any particular religion is "correct".|`|2zd9OjeMaa	You're both Christians, what's the problem?<br>  <br>  If you agree that Catholics are Christians, why can't you agree that he's a practicing Christian?

They believe in the divinity of Christ and that salvation comes from Him.  If you don't believe this, than you've never been to Mass and listened to the recitation of the Creed.  I suggest you do so. Every year, Catholics renew their baptismal vows in which they renounce evil and accept Christ as their savior at a special Mass which usually comes around this time of year.<br>  You might not agree with some of the superfulous beliefs that the church teaches; fine, don't believe them.  And don't start quoting limited scripture to back up a specific point, becaue the RC church can throw it all back at you.  One can quote the Bible to back up ANY point of view.|`|QUg9W2NGaa	Anyone willing to accept Jesus as his/her savior is a Christian.

Only people do.<br>  <br>  But according to the Bible, Jesus said, "Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand."|`|xi9YtImfaa	Catholics are Christians. Catholicism is a denomination of Christianity. If you do not believe me, then think about it like this. The basic belief of Christianity is that Jesus was the son of God and that he died and rose again. Catholics believe this. Most likely you are what we call a Protestant. The Protestant denomination was created by Martin Luther in the 16th century, who disagreed with Catholic beliefs. Regardless of the fact that Catholics have a few different beliefs and practices, they are still technically Christians. If necessary, research Catholicism and Protestantism to learn their differences and similarities.|`|cdFqekzZaa	God says catholics can't go in protestant churches, but you can go to his.

6f80f9f2966482571dff80706a0a7db5aa	Part of the problem is that when people think of Africa, they think of a monolithic whole.  Africa is a _continent_, not a country.  That's an important distinction to make, for not all of Africa is in dire straits.<br>  <br>  However, for those parts of the continent that are in peril, I think the first step is for those countries to start taking control of their own resources.  Nigeria is rich with oil, Sierra Leone has gold and diamonds, and the same can be found in South Africa.  However, unfortunately, most of those resources are controlled by outside organizations, a definite by-product of colonialism.  Africa is so rich with resources, but few of the countries actually benefit from having them.<br>  <br>  Secondly, the birth rate must decline.  I'm not suggesting that abortions be given or anything of that nature; I'm simply suggesting that perhaps a limitation on the number of children a familiy can have should be mandated.  A lot of African countries are in the same position as China once was: They have large populations that they cannot support.  <br>  <br>  Thirdly, the country must rid itself of its outside influence, particularly who exploit these countries.  History shows that there were many African nations that thrived and prospered until Arabic and European influences changed the manner in which they operated.  A return to the old ways, while seemingly archaic to some, certainly would do the continent well.|`|AA10489318	First and fore most, all of you learned Africans, join together and make your nation as big as it could get just like America and elect a democratic Government.

If Jehovah God is all-powerful, loving, wise, and just, why is the world so full of hatred and injustice? Have you ever wondered about these things yourself?<br>  <br>  3 Is it wrong to ask why God allows suffering? Some worry that asking such a question means that they do not have enough faith or that they are showing disrespect for God. When reading the Bible, however, you will find that faithful, God-fearing people had similar questions. For example, the prophet Habakkuk asked Jehovah: “Why is it that you make me see what is hurtful, and you keep looking upon mere trouble? And why are despoiling and violence in front of me, and why does quarreling occur, and why is strife carried?”—Habakkuk 1:3.<br>  <br>  4 Did Jehovah scold the faithful prophet Habakkuk for asking such questions? No. Instead, God included Habakkuk’s sincere words in the inspired Bible record. God also helped him to get a clearer understanding of matters and to gain greater faith. Jehovah wants to do the same for you. Remember, the Bible teaches that “he cares for you.” (1?Peter 5:7) God hates wickedness and the suffering it causes far more than any human does. (Isaiah 55:8,?9) Why, then, is there so much suffering in the world?<br>  <br>  WHY SO MUCH SUFFERING?<br>  <br>  5 People of various religions have gone to their religious leaders and teachers to ask why there is so much suffering. Often, the response is that suffering is God’s will and that he long ago determined everything that would ever happen, including tragic events. Many are told that God’s ways are mysterious or that he brings death upon people—even children—so that he can have them in heaven with him. As you have learned, though, Jehovah God never causes what is bad. The Bible says: “Far be it from the true God to act wickedly, and the Almighty to act unjustly!”—Job 34:10.<br>  <br>  6 Do you know why people make the mistake of blaming God for all the suffering in the world? In many cases, they blame Almighty God because they think that he is the real ruler of this world. They do not know a simple but important truth that the Bible teaches. You learned that truth in Chapter?3 of this book. The real ruler of this world is Satan the Devil.<br>  <br>  7 The Bible clearly states: “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (1?John 5:19) When you think about it, does that not make sense? This world reflects the personality of the invisible spirit creature who is “misleading the entire inhabited earth.” (Revelation 12:9) Satan is hateful, deceptive, and cruel. So the world, under his influence, is full of hatred, deceit, and cruelty. That is one reason why there is so much suffering.<br>  <br>  8 A second reason why there is so much suffering is that, as discussed in Chapter?3, mankind has been imperfect and sinful ever since the rebellion in the garden of Eden. Sinful humans tend to struggle for dominance, and this results in wars, oppression, and suffering. (Ecclesiastes 4:1; 8:9) A third reason for suffering is “time and unforeseen occurrence.” (Ecclesiastes 9:11) In a world without Jehovah as a protective Ruler, people may suffer because they happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br>  <br>  9 It is comforting for us to know that God does not cause suffering. He is not responsible for the wars, the crimes, the oppression, or even the natural disasters that cause people to suffer. Still, we need to know, Why does Jehovah allow all this suffering? If he is the Almighty, he has the power to stop it. Why, then, does he hold back? The loving God that we have come to know must have a good reason.—1?John 4:8.<br>  <br>  A VITAL ISSUE IS RAISED<br>  <br>  10 To find out why God allows suffering, we need to think back to the time when suffering began. When Satan led Adam and Eve into disobeying Jehovah, an important question was raised. Satan did not call into question Jehovah’s power. Even Satan knows that there is no limit to Jehovah’s power. Rather, Satan questioned Jehovah’s right to rule. By calling God a liar who withholds good from his subjects, Satan charged that Jehovah is a bad ruler. (Genesis 3:2-5) Satan implied that mankind would be better off without God’s rulership. This was an attack on Jehovah’s sovereignty, his right to rule.<br>  <br>  11 Adam and Eve rebelled against Jehovah. In effect, they said: “We do not need Jehovah as our Ruler. We can decide for ourselves what is right and what is wrong.” How could Jehovah settle that issue? How could he teach all intelligent creatures that the rebels were wrong and that his way truly is best? Someone might say that God should simply have destroyed the rebels and made a fresh start. But Jehovah had stated his purpose to fill the earth with the offspring of Adam and Eve, and he wanted them to live in an earthly paradise. (Genesis 1:28) Jehovah always fulfills his purposes. (Isaiah 55:10,?11) Besides that, getting rid of the rebels in Eden would not have answered the question that had been raised regarding Jehovah’s right to rule.<br>  <br>  12 Let us consider an illustration. Imagine that a teacher is telling his students how to solve a difficult problem. A clever but rebellious student claims that the teacher’s way of solving the problem is wrong. Implying that the teacher is not capable, this rebel insists that he knows a much better way to solve the problem. Some students think that he is right, and they also become rebellious. What should the teacher do? If he throws the rebels out of the class, what will be the effect on the other students? Will they not believe that their fellow student and those who joined him are right? All the other students in the class might lose respect for the teacher, thinking that he is afraid of being proved wrong. But suppose that the teacher allows the rebel to show the class how he would solve the problem.<br>  <br>  13 Jehovah has done something similar to what the teacher does. Remember that the rebels in Eden were not the only ones involved. Millions of angels were watching. (Job 38:7; Daniel 7:10) How Jehovah handled the rebellion would greatly affect all those angels and eventually all intelligent creation. So, what has Jehovah done? He has allowed Satan to show how he would rule mankind. God has also allowed humans to govern themselves under Satan’s guidance.<br>  <br>  14 The teacher in our illustration knows that the rebel and the students on his side are wrong. But he also knows that allowing them the opportunity to try to prove their point will benefit the whole class. When the rebels fail, all honest students will see that the teacher is the only one qualified to lead the class. They will understand why the teacher thereafter removes any rebels from the class. Similarly, Jehovah knows that all honesthearted humans and angels will benefit from seeing that Satan and his fellow rebels have failed and that humans cannot govern themselves. Like Jeremiah of old, they will learn this vital truth: “I well know, O?Jehovah, that to earthling man his way does not belong. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.”—Jeremiah 10:23.<br>  <br>  WHY SO LONG?<br>  <br>  15 Why, though, has Jehovah allowed suffering to go on for so long? And why does he not prevent bad things from happening? Well, consider two things that the teacher in our illustration would not do. First, he would not stop the rebel student from presenting his case. Second, the teacher would not help the rebel to make his case. Similarly, consider two things that Jehovah has determined not to do. First, he has not stopped Satan and those who side with him from trying to prove that they are right. Allowing time to pass has thus been necessary. In the thousands of years of human history, mankind has been able to try every form of self-rule, or human government. Mankind has made some advances in science and other fields, but injustice, poverty, crime, and war have grown ever worse. Human rule has now been shown to be a failure.<br>  <br>  16 Second, Jehovah has not helped Satan to rule this world. If God were to prevent horrible crimes, for instance, would he not, in effect, be supporting the case of the rebels? Would God not be making people think that perhaps humans can govern themselves without disastrous results? If Jehovah were to act in that way, he would become party to a lie. However, “it is impossible for God to lie.”—Hebrews 6:18.<br>  <br>  17 What, though, about all the harm that has been done during the long rebellion against God? We do well to remember that Jehovah is almighty. Therefore, he can and will undo the effects of mankind’s suffering. As we have already learned, the ruining of our planet will be undone by the turning of the earth into Paradise. The effects of sin will be removed through faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice, and the effects of death will be reversed by means of the resurrection. God will thus use Jesus “to break up the works of the Devil.” (1?John 3:8) Jehovah will bring all of this about at just the right time. We can be glad that he has not acted sooner, for his patience has given us the opportunity to learn the truth and to serve him. (2?Peter 3:9,?10) Meanwhile, God has been actively seeking sincere worshipers and helping them to endure any suffering that may come upon them in this troubled world.—John 4:23; 1?Corinthians 10:13.<br>  <br>  18 Some might wonder, Could all this suffering have been prevented if God had created Adam and Eve in such a way that they could not rebel? To answer that question, you need to remember a precious gift that Jehovah has given you.<br>  <br>  HOW WILL YOU USE THE GIFT FROM GOD?<br>  <br>  19 As was noted in Chapter?5, humans were created with free will. Do you realize what a precious gift that is? God has made countless animals, and these are driven largely by instinct. (Proverbs 30:24) Man has made some robots that can be programmed to follow every command. Would we be happy if God had made us like that? No, we are glad to have the freedom to make choices about what kind of person to become, what course of life to pursue, what friendships to form, and so on. We love to have a measure of freedom, and that is what God wants us to enjoy.<br>  <br>  20 Jehovah is not interested in service performed under compulsion. (2?Corinthians 9:7) To illustrate: What would please a parent more—a child’s saying “I love you” because he is told to say it or his saying it freely from the heart? So the question is, How will you use the free will that Jehovah has given you? Satan, Adam, and Eve made the worst possible use of free will. They rejected Jehovah God. What will you do?<br>  <br>  21 You have the opportunity to put the marvelous gift of free will to the best possible use. You can join the millions who have taken a stand on Jehovah’s side. They make God rejoice because they take an active part in proving Satan a liar and a miserable failure as a ruler. (Proverbs 27:11) You too can do that by choosing the right course of life. This will be explained in the next chapter.<br>  <br>  WHAT THE BIBLE TEACHES<br>  <br>  · God does not cause the bad conditions in the world.—Job 34:10.<br>  <br>  · By calling God a liar and saying that He withholds good from His subjects, Satan questioned Jehovah’s right to rule.—Genesis 3:2-5.<br>  <br>  · Jehovah will use his Son, the Ruler of the Messianic Kingdom, to end all human suffering and to undo its effects.—1?John 3:8.|`|1f91c8414c59b009a43db2c49ef75dd8aa	There is suffering in the world because there is sin in the world.

Since the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc had been used, and both alphabets continued to be used in parallel for some time. Futhorc influenced the Latin alphabet by providing it with the letters thorn t and wynn ?. The letter eth e was later devised as a modification of d, and finally yogh ? was created by Norman scribes from the insular g used in Old English and Irish and used alongside their Carolingian g. Additionally, the ligatures double-u w for vv, ?sh ? for ae, and ?thel ? for oe were in use.<br>  <br>  In the year 1011, a writer named Byrhtfere ordered the Old English alphabet for numerological purposes.[2] He listed the 24 letters of the Latin alphabet (including ampersand) first, then 5 additional English letters, starting with the nota or ond, ?, which was a specifically English symbol for and:<br>  <br>  A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X Y Z & ? ? T D ? <br>  [edit]<br>  Modern English<br>  In Modern English orthography, t, ?, e, and ? are obsolete, although t continued its existence for some time, its lower case form gradually becoming graphically indistinguishable from the minuscule y in most handwritings. On the other hand, u and j were introduced as distinct from v and i in the 16th century, and w assumed the status of an independent letter, so that the English alphabet is now considered to consist of the following 26 letters:<br>  <br>  (Etc, Etc...)

But what I don't understand is that at first it's the badness that girls are attracted to, but when they start dating and become more serious with the guy, then all of a sudden they want that nice, sweet guy that's ready to settle down.  And I think that when women have this type of mindset, they make those truly good guys want to turn bad, because they think that’s what they have to do to get women to like them.  I guess the way I see it,  girls should stop going for those "bad boys" and start going for those guys who are the nice, polite, and humble types.  Because deep down, and at the end of the day that's the type of guy most girls want to spend their life with anyway.

My own preference would be a smiling hello, with a hug if it has been a long time since I've seen them.<br>  <br>  My fourth grade teacher used to make us line up when it was time to go home:  boys only had to shake her hand to get out the door, but the girls had to give and receive cheek kisses.

I admit I do respond back with the hug and the kiss but I just kiss the air, one time I actually did kiss their check and left lipstick LOL! anyways I guess it just depends in what situation your in. I do not think this is apporpriate in business situations unless your traveling to do business in a different country but I get what your saying its so weird. I hate that much physical contact.

If you don't feel comfortable, be sure to offer the extended handshake or hug first so they know what greeting you are going for.|`|LKUjbuCuaa	kissing as a greeting is customary in some cultures, but not in mainstream North America.  I would be very wary about kissing anyone but an intimate partner.|`|AA11780840	Different customs from different cultures and even a person's upbringing have a lot to do with how one greets some one. My partner is from Bolivia - Latin America.. At a party or just visiting a family memberr or friends it is Customary to give a peck on the cheek near the mouth and a hug to say hi and if you don't then it is seen as an insult. First couple times it was quite uncomfortable because I don't know these people from Adam.. but I just learned to accept it. It is not the end of the world. By the way it is customary to kiss and hug leaving as well. My partner has 10 brothers and sisters, countless nieces and nephews and cousins... so I feel like I need a bath after wards. If it is at work it its even more awkward but maybe if you go and greet them first and give them a hand shake and stand back quickly it won't give them an opportunity to land you with a kiss... But if it doesn't feel like it will be the end of the world just let it be... Embrace the customs of other cultures..Also, when and if they come to your house and when you just hug them or shake their hands SINCE it is your house and your domain...It will feel awkward for them.<br>  <br>  Been there and still here and still being slobbered on... <br>  Good luck and just try to make light of it...

It seems to be a knee-jerk response, fueled by emotion, antagonism and territorialism. I suspect its an evolutionary hangover - humans are very aggresive by nature, and in historical terms have only recently started to deal with this. Its notable that racism tends to florish in times when space and resources are scarce, and seems to stem from a human tendency to define themselves by what they aren't, rather than what they are.|`|0hsh000waa	Through their experiences with people of other races, through the media, through peers etc..<br>  <br>  I think some people lack the common knowledge that "just because some _____people are like that doesn't mean al of the are".

The truth is that it doesn't matter where you travel on this great big planet or what culture of people you happen to visit, you will find people with racist attitudes.  We evolved to be prejudiced against things that are different and it's a good thing to.  If we hadn't, humans would have been very easy prey and we probably would have been wiped out as a species.  Think about it.  Humans for all intents and purposes are animals, despite our advanced intelligence.  When you have gone walking in the woods, how many animals have just walked up to you without fear?  I am going to guess that this has never happened.  Animals have an innate fear of those things that are different, and humans are animals.  Don't get me wrong, we can over come these feelings somewhat because of our intelligence, but we can never fully get rid of them.|`|agyl1OEqaa	It is a taught behavior. If a child grows up in a racist home they will most likely be racist because they were taught to be. It is hard to change ones beliefs, and people fear change. As time has passed, race hasn't been as big of an issue as it was in the past, but there still are hate-filled people out there. People fear change and they fear things (or people) that are different.|`|WBf2V8vSaa	I am not racist but I live in the south {Virginia, and I actually live on a civil war battlefield}. The school systems seem to think that everyone who wears Dixie Outfitter shirts, or the rebel flag is racist and that is not the case. They think only white people can be racist which is false. I got in trouble for wearing a dixie outfitter shirt to school, but that day I walked past so many colored people wearing Malcolm X shirts and such. My administer was colored, and I asked her why they could wear their shirts and I couldn't and she didn't know what to say. The school systems allow colored people to call us "crackers" and such without punishment. But surely if a Caucasian called a colored person the "n" word they would get suspended. Some colored people think white people owe them something because they were slaves, but they don't realize that a white people tried to free their ancestors and that their ancestors were slaves not them. I was born and raised in the south, and I have absolutely nothing against african americans. They are people just like you and me, and skin color means nothing. We don't discriminate against crayons because they are different colors do we? The rebel flag was actually made many many many years after slavery was over, and the good old american flag was flying on the ships that brought the slaves from Africa. I don't know how or where racism started though. I hope my information helped you. Here is a link that is on the dixie outfitters website. This link has news stories and such. You can also navigate through the website and read more about the civil war and slavery.

You have tiny waist! *envy*<br>  <br>  "Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is the ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hips. It measures the proportion by which fat is distributed around the torso. The concept and significance of WHR was first theorized by evolutionary psychologist Dr. Devendra Singh at the University of Texas at Austin in 1993."<br>  <br>  "A WHR of 0.7 for women and 0.9 for men have been shown to correlate strongly with general health and fertility. Women within the 0.7 range have optimal levels of estrogen and are less susceptible to major diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders and ovarian cancers. Men with WHRs around 0.9, similarly, have been shown to be more healthy and fertile with less prostate cancer and testicular cancer."<br>  <br>  "WHR is considered to be factor in a person's attractiveness. Women with a 0.7 WHR (waist circumference being 70% of the hip circumference) are often rated as more attractive by men regardless of culture, race, religion or ethnicity. Such diverse beauty icons as Marilyn Monroe, Twiggy, Sophia Loren, Kate Moss, Salma Hayek and even the Venus de Milo all have ratios around 0.7, even though they have significantly different weights."|`|h5CsfdR6aa	Are we to believe you just bec you tell us ?

Los textos de la biblia no están mal traducidos como muchos por intereses quieren hacer creer. De hecho, ha sido el trabajo de una cantidad inmensa de personas que por separado han realizado su traducción y luego han sido cotejadas con muy pocas variaciones, para tener un texto lo mas parecido posible al original. Por otro lado, es cierto que existen muchas interpretaciones vagas, basadas en el deseo de tener la razón a las malas sobre ciertas posiciones teológicas. Pero lo fundamental es creer que Jesús es el hijo de Dios, que murió por nuestros pecados y recibir en nuestros corazones sus palabras.

El Hijo no esta hecho de la misma sustancia del Padre o sea que el Hijo no es Dios.

AA12153652	The word "life" and its historic meanings have existed in recorded culture for at least fifteen hundred years. The actual word "life" in English can be attributed to the word "lif" used in Old English and Old Saxon meaning- life, body.<br>  <br>  The word is linked to the emergence of a religious and social philosophy of European Celtic mythology (around 550AD) that believed human beings possessed a special "quality of life", that vanishes at the point of death. This has often been described as the "essence of life", or the "fifth essence" after fire, water, earth and wind. "Losing" this essence has therefore been historically linked to human death for at least fifteen hundred years. <br>  <br>  Prior to this period (550AD), there does not appear to be corresponding words in either Ancient Latin or Greek. This supports the argument that the word lif was created in both a social and religious (metaphysical) context. <br>  <br>  It is no surprise then, that the word "lif " was quickly associated with another philosophical belief that all humans possess a special spirit called the "soul". <br>  <br>  Philosophers (around 1350AD) speculated that this essence is derived from the presence of the "soul", which at the point of human death leaves the body. The belief of the soul leaving the body at death precedes the concept of the essence of life by at least one thousand years (around 600BC for the first writings on the concept of Soul). <br>  <br>  Then around 1650, Renne Descartes published a historical work that for the first time provided a scientific basis for proving that human beings are aware and self aware. It was Descartes that wrote the now famous self aware proof of existence "I think, therefore I am." <br>  <br>  In the past three to four hundred years, the historical usage of the word "life" has been extended to describe a wider quality which all plants and animals on Earth possess before a the state of death. Interestingly, this broadening of the definition of life has almost a direct correlation to the advancement of science into atomic and biologic areas. Everytime science has proven that more objects in the Universe share similar qualities to humans, the philosophical defintion of life has appeared to widen around ten to twenty years after the discovery. <br>  <br>  In the last sixty years, a further attribute to what is "life", has been assigned being the quality of awareness. Therefore, almost all modern interpretations on the meaning of life includes as part of the definition of life a state of "awareness". <br>  <br>  These are my words. Cheers. My web site is listed below.|`|AA10489318	Definition of life is "LIVING".

TzY9vkinaa	I don't think it would make a difference to most of the women. Women know what a fetus is and what it turns into.<br>  <br>  PS- I liked that ultra sound, I can't believe people would abort those little babies.|`|urIm4YaBaa	If the ultrasound was going to provide medically-relevant information, sure. But, the last time I checked, most people don't know how to interpret what they're seeing on the screen. Even doctors have to rely on technicians to report the results to them. How do you expect a patient to understand what she sees?<br>  <br>  Ultrasounds are diagnostic tools. They should be used for diagnostic reasons. Diagnostic procedures are done in order to make forthcoming medical decisions. To use the ultrasound *after* a procedure has been chosen is not a diagnostic reason.<br>  <br>  If the ultrasound isn't being used to provide more information, then this whole question has nothing to do with making the ultrasound being necessary "to make a fully informed choice."|`|hiCSVwchaa	Maybe because women already understand what is happening, and I don't approve of psychological torture.<br>  <br>  Anybody who thinks women have abortions lightly or without the realization of what they're doing is misinformed.<br>  <br>  Also, at the stage at which most women have abortions, nothing would show up on the ultrasound.|`|THRtsl83aa	Only if they are also allowed to make a fully informed choice about killing their child up to the age of 18.  It's the same thing.|`|Y5FyAekkaa	I think that anyone considering an abortion should have an ultrasound first for two reasons.<br>  <br>  1. It gives them the opportunity to identify the health of their baby. It prepares them for the possibility that they may have to raise a baby who is deformed or very sick. And then they can make a complete decision based on financial and emotional stability.<br>  <br>  2. I think it brings the realism of a living life inside you when you see the baby or hear a heartbeat. Women who have abortions need to understand how they truly feel about that baby and the decision they are about to make.<br>  <br>  I am not prochoice nor am I prolife. I am procircumstance. I feel that for the health and safety of every woman out there they should have endless resources to education regarding this difficult decision so that no matter what they decide they can put themselves on the road to a healthy life.|`|WL7nKDplaa	I think they should be ALLOWED to make a fully informed decision, but they shouldn't have to. Having an ultrasound won't give you more information about abortion, it will just give you more information about your baby. If a woman can't take care of a child and provide a good home, she should be able to make this choice.<br>  <br>  If you can't trust me with a choice how can you trust me with a child?|`|dFBccLExaa	I guess that depends on who is paying for the ultrasound. Many women who consider abortions have issues with finding the cash for it (from what I've seen). I can understand why you'd want to- mainly in hopes that they may not have the abortion. In the end, I don't see what it does except to maybe guilt trip them. Most women who get rid of their fetuses (feti?) because it could kill them already know what they're getting rid of. <br>  Here's a question- would you make a rape or incest victim have the same ultrasound?|`|b7d3fe1e0770cd80916e81d846475327aa	Of course.  What a silly question!  I knew I was pregnant and I knew how that felt WAY before I ever had an ultrasound.  You don't need to see the fetus to know it's there.  And what's with you people trying to add more guilt to an already challenging situation?  Leave it alone.  Women can make their own informed choices regarding their bodies without people like you getting involved.  If they want an ultrasound, then they should have access to one, certainly, but there is no need to force it on them.|`|2zd9OjeMaa	How does an ultrasound inform the woman of anything new? It's a completely unnecessary guilt trip for the woman. <br>  <br>  It doesn't show the truth, it simply plays with emotions. Do you think that open heart surgery patients should be shown videos of previous surgeries to inform them? It will freak them out while informing them of nothing.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	A woman can get an ultra sound if she wants one.  However you have no business making it mandatory.  And it's incredibly arrogant of you to suggest that if a women doesn't get an ultrasound that she is uninformed.|`|rWP4suXuaa	There is no choice but life.<br>  <br>  God loves you...god bless|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Absolutely. Ultrasounds aren't just informing them, it is a play to emotions and it is a cruel thing that some organizations do to convince them to back out.<br>  <br>  They should have the risks explained to them. The women should be expected to make the decision int eh first trimester, but they shouldn't be pressured.<br>  <br>  ADD: No, I object people it messes with their objectivity. You know that you want it done because in such a weak state girls are likely to go back on their decision. It isn't any of your buisness, so stop trying to make it sound like you are on their side. It is sneaky and wrong.|`|zkPSQs7xaa	The scan before an abortion is used to determine the length/gestation of the pregnancy so correct medical procedures are carried out.<br>  Any pregnant woman should be able to make her own choice about terminating her pregnancy and aborting her child.<br>  It is no concern nor business of anyone else.<br>  Better ana abortion than a child born to an unfit mother. We already have way too many unwanted children..why add to this.<br>  I wish ppl would mind their own and stop playing god with other ppls lives.|`|Xu4x19y6aa	My opinion would be an ultrasound would help the mother understand that it's not a mass of cells she is simply having sucked out - it's a tiny PERSON.  At one month the heart beats, at 8 weeks it sucks it's tiny thumb - it's has a BEATING HEART.   People are outraged at the way animals are slaughtered for meat packing or see women wearing a fur but somehow sucking a babies tiny body out it's mothers womb seems a "choice" that civilized people can live with?  I don't get that?  If it's not rape, incest of killing the mother, the pregnancy should be a chance for adoption - so many loving families are waiting to babies to love and to raise.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	Maybe because they don't need a mandatory guilt trip in such a horrible time of their lives?<br>  <br>  Edit: During the first months of pregnancy, it's not a baby yet. Only assembled tissue to be exact.<br>  <br>  I'm saying this as a Pro-Lifer.|`|sjYBcnYLaa	If you do, why are so many pro-choice organizations opposed to mandatory ultrasounds before abortions?<br>  <br>  one and one one reason why - WE DO NOT WANT TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO. that's why its called a CHOICE. when are you conservative nut jobs going to get it through your heads? if we wanted to see a picture of the fetus we would ASK to see one. but MAKING us do something in the hopes that it will change our mind by disguising it as "informed" is complete B.S. and you know it.<br>  <br>  Don't you think an ultrasound would help women have comlpete information regarding the pregnancy they are ending?<br>  <br>  no there is more then enough information out there on the procedure. there is nothing that looking at a fuzzy picture of a fetus on a screen is going to do other then verify that yes i am indeed pregnant. but guess what? the doctor examining me can tell me that, the blood test i took can tell me that oh and the stick i peed on can tell me that too. all the ultrasound does is verify there it a fetus in there...<br>  <br>  If you think ultrasound shouldn't be offered or mandatory, can you really argue that you support women being fully informed about the procedure?<br>  <br>  yes, i just did above.<br>  how do you people think we all got around back in the day when we didn't have this technology? an ultrasound isn't the holy grail to completely and totally understanding pregnancy and abortion. and an ultrasound does not an informed choice make.<br>  <br>  I'm asking in R&S because a R&Ser posted such a lovely ultrasound picture in her question!<br>  <br>  yeah she wanted a fortune teller to tell her about her baby...did you happen to lecture her about the evils of fortune tellers? while using her posting as an reason to espouse anti-choice arguements?|`|0b1bc0d20db45e766b5bd783ee1b2812aa	Suppose a women knew that the fetus she was carrying had the fatal <br>  Infantile Tay-Sachs disease- a very horrible and painful death. Should she have to visit children with this disorder before she decides to have the baby?  Should she have to see their lives of daily suffering before she can be said to make informed consent?<br>  <br>  Should the crack-addicted mother have to sober up and see children living tortous brain-damaged lives before she makes the decision to have her baby?|`|P544Sbmqaa	I support them having one if its what they want.  If they dont want one, I feel that is their choice.

El mesías judío debía nacer en Belén y ser de la casa de David. Así también quisieron hacer descender de David a Jesús aunque con dos genealogías distintas (otro intento falso para hacerlo mesías de los judíos). Esta el hecho de que su padre no es José sino dios lo cual inhabilita la genealogía (salvo que el ser "hijo de dios" fuera posterior).<br>  Fue Pablo el que sacó totalmente lo judío del cristianismo inicial quedándose sólo con los gentiles (no judiós).

Desde el siglo VI se considera que la era cristiana comienza el a?o de su nacimiento, pero en la actualidad se cifra un error de cuatro a ocho a?os. Para los cristianos, Jesús fue el Hijo de Dios encarnado y concebido por María, la mujer de José, un carpintero de Nazaret. El nombre de Jesús se deriva de la palabra hebrea Joshua, que completa es Yehoshuah (‘Yahvé es salvación’); y el título de Cristo, de la palabra griega christos, a su vez una traducción del hebreo mashiaj (‘el ungido’), o Mesías. Los primeros cristianos emplearon Cristo por considerarle el libertador prometido de Israel; más adelante, la Iglesia lo incorporó a su nombre para designarle como redentor de toda la humanidad.
qbQT7oMtaa	I tried Rosetta Stone for Spanish. It was effective to learn basic words and sentences. It does not have any grammar or conjugation instructions though so it will be very hard to go beyond the basics with it. <br>  <br>  My college uses another software called TeLL me More, by Auralog. I found it more complete and less repetitive. It covers not only the basics, but also intermediate or advanced level. My goal was to become fluent so it was perfect for me. It has a lot of different activities: picture/word association, videos, dialogues,..., includes also grammar and conjugation. It has also more content than Rosetta Stone as far as level and number of hours of learning and is cheaper. Their speech recognition is great so you can have a dialogue with the computer. You can check out their website at <a href="http://www.auralog.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.auralog.com</a> for a free demo and compare too. <br>  I did not personally try their Chinese program but really liked their Spanish one<br>  <br>  The best way to learn a language would be through immersion, visiting these countries.

In Japan, the most popular foreign languages would be English and Chinese.<br>  <br>  Spanish and Portuguese are popular due to the large population of overseas Japanese (Nikkei) in Latin America.<br>  Many European languages are studied according to people's own fascination. Like people in other countries, French is often considered romantic. Many study French, Italian and German because of their love for European arts and cultures.<br>  <br>  It is a sells pitch to name products in foreign names. Just like H?agen-Dazs in America, foreign names gives a product an exotic image. In manga and anime, German are used for similar reasons.|`|oBlBmxGzaa	i don't know if its popular to learn there<br>  but they use a lot of words with german roots...like arbeito...means having part time jobs..and in german it means working...<br>  <br>  baumekucen...is baumkuchen a special christmas cake ..and japanese use german cake receipies...<br>  <br>  thats what my japanese friends told me, there more words I could understand while there've been talking but i forgot
AA11320766	Pinyin was created to teach people the pronunciation for individual Chinese characters because the characters, being "pictographs", don't have any form of reliable phonetics make-up. <br>  <br>  Many Chinese, by their 30's don't even remember pinyin and even though they may see it around on signs, many times they think it is English. The reasons for many signs having pinyin is varied; for children (street signs etc.), for people to think it looks more international (advertisements and products).<br>  <br>  Pinyin is only dependable for a fraction of the comprehension that you get from characters. What I mean is that if you write a word in pinyin such as:  "shi wu" virtually no one would ever know what you are talking about without the presence of characters. It could be a number of things; fifteen, food stuff, lost objects, and other meanings. So with pinyin, and context, you can understand simple phrases and sentences but nothing of a complexed make-up. This is why the language has never migrated to a non-character writing system, the language was basically built on the character system and not the other way around, therefore they would be lost without the characters. <br>  <br>  For getting around in China without characters, it is possible but if you write pinyin expecting people to really understand you should find children or students, older people will only give you a blank stare and may even tell the person next to them that you are writing in a foreign language and laugh. <br>  <br>  I think it's best to have access to a phrase book with the characters and pinyin; you can try and pronounce it and they can at least know what you are trying to say.<br>  <br>  So in the end, don't expect pinyin to help you much beyond knowing how to pronounce Mandarin.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4FMXu72qaa	To the Chinese, pinyin is simply a romanized pronunciation system that helps kids say the characters correctly before they learn to read and write them.  It's not very widely used at all, I'm afraid.  All printed materials are character-based...the only materials with both characters and pinyin are children's books.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|54539a0375b23ade43c058bf8f7ba041aa	I know this doesn't answer your question, but what is Pinyin?|`|eU3jj8VFaa	Many Chinese go entire life without knowing Pinyin. The attitude with Pinyin is similar to phonic symbols for English speakers. Most English speakers aren't familiar with phonic symbols on dictionaries, but are aware of their usage.<br>  <br>  Pinyin is mainly a tool for foreign learners, for that I include Chinese who's native dialect isn't Mandarin. The Chinese government further simplified it by introducing romanized alphabets in the 80's. Due to recent political instabilities, the older Zhuyin fuhao method is used in Taiwan, Malaysia and sometimes Singapore.<br>  <br>  In China, children's book sometimes come with Pinyin (similar to Japanese children's book with Hiragana). I'm not aware of any other usage for the locals.<br>  <br>  Chinese is a visual language (English is a vocal language). You're missing out a lot if you don't learn the writing system. It might seem hard at first, but there are orders and logics to them. Kinda like pre-fix and suffix, there are some tricks that allows you to remember large number of words. Besides, Chinese character's combination is very efficient, you only need to know 500 of them for everyday living. For English, one needs to know 26 alphabets but 40,000 words for everyday living.<br>  <br>  As a Chinese, there are many words that I have no clue how to pronounce. But the hint of the writing gives me ideas of what it is about. You can visualize the meaning a lot better if you know how to write it.<br>  <br>  Of course, you can learn it well without learning characters. Afterall, 5-8% of Chinese are Illiterate.|`|f69059ccd1f529a0635ed2eebcbf2499aa	I am learning Chinese.. I communicate with Chinese pals using both PinYin and Hanzi.  Many times Pinyin is used when you want to IM your friends and you dont have access to chinese characters.  <br>  <br>  Pinyin is used for childrens books reading practice.  There is also BoPoMoFo which another type of transcription that helps you learn.<br>  <br>  I am sorry to tell you that you really need to learn some characters because alot of Pinyin looks the same and you would not know what it actually means unless you saw the characters.  For example:<br>  <br>  jie shi can mean:解释-explain, 结实-strong, 揭示make known, 届时-at the scheduled time, 结识get introduced to someone, 结石kidney stone, 节食go on a diet.|`|ab12bf1cc4fcd2264e88fe8e2ee186f2aa	To whoever posted this: <br>     <br>  Many Chinese go entire life without knowing Pinyin.

AA11872632	Esperanto was invented in 1917.  At a time when English had not yet become a second language for the ENTIRE business  and traveler's world.<br>  I suppose it had its usefulness up until about World War  Two when the world seemed pretty divided and separated between the continents of Europe, North/South America, Asia.<br>  <br>  But after World War Two, 1945, technology and trade and culture rapidly came together.  And English was everywhere in the world's development.<br>  English replaced any need for some "invented" language that you had to study.  English was there in Business, Films, Music, Travel, Science, Construction, Politics... Totally English uniting the post War World.<br>  <br>  Sorry....goodbye 1917, invention by a Polish guy, L L Zamenhof, Esperanto.|`|AA10797291	No, not really. It seems kind of useless to me as I've never met anybody that speaks it.|`|VLcDWWwmaa	No. It would be an easy language to learn and the idea behind it is good, but not enough people welcome the idea of an official international language for it to actually be of practical use. You're much better off learning an in-use modern foreign language. The highest in-demand languages right now are Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic, so I would learn one of those. Hope this helps!|`|knQGboARaa	I actually started trying to teach myself esperanto a while ago, it was super easy, and if i ruled the world I think it would be an excellent idea to make it the international language, but unfortunately i think english has taken over somewhat nowadays, and so there's not so much point in esperanto anymore, but i would certainly welcome learning more in my own time. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't pay for lessons though if that's what you're implying|`|zKa69WXAaa	Well, I don't see much of practical use in Esperanto. It seems to me that quite a narrow group of people use this language actively. <br>  I might be interested in Esperanto, though, as in any other new foreign language, but I simply have no time for it!

A Shaman is, in some religions, the title of a wise person. A spiritual leader or guide. In other belief systems, a Shaman's is a healer. Someone who uses natural remedies to cure spiritual, physical, mental, or emotional ailments. Hope this helps.|`|urIm4YaBaa	There isn't really a "shaman faith," so to speak. Various cultures had spiritual advisors (and, occasionally, leaders) called shamans. <br>  <br>  The actual beliefs varied from culture to culture, but many saw shamans as a link or intermediary between the sacred and the mundane world. Sometimes, shamans acted as divine oracles, or were at least used to interpret allegedly divine signs. Some were regarded as healers. Others helped members of the community reach the land of the dead peacefully by embarking on spiritual journeys to help the recently deceased. Still others held an advisory roll, much as a priest might do for his congregation. It's quite possible for them to have many different duties. Again, I can't stress enough that the role varied between cultures. What any given shaman might have done in his community or religion may not have been what another shaman was doing in his community or religion.|`|4AJkaIkqaa	a shaman is a spiritual healer, i'm not sure of any religious associations.  In many cultures there is a shaman who is essentially a doctor that does the healing of the tribe they are associated with.  Why someone says that they are a practicing shaman and not refering to that they may just mean their religious views are more nature oriented and and that they are one with the earth or something like that.|`|STLS9XXYaa	there`s different ways of shamanism. it goes from manipulating the weather in order to gain a good season harvest to entering in to a higher state of consciousness to communicate with beings of other dimensions,healing the sick to even put malignant spell on others.<br>  and also posses a strong psychics abilities. the way u know that u had met a real shaman from a person who`s full of B.S.,is by the ability of there manifestations. if u want to have an idea of good shaman vs evil shaman,watch the movie the ron howard`s the missing.|`|pfNnuD5saa	Some forms of Paganism have Shamans. They are holy people that practice the rituals etc of the type of Paganism they are associated with. It is common among most tribal people, like First Nation and the Mongols. They are healers, and spiritual guides. etc|`|AA11346514	Shaman is no more or no less than the correct word to use for what were formerly called witch doctors.|`|bnjjeBLYaa	You're not offending anyone, it's ok. You just honestly want to know, which is admirable. <br>  <br>  Shamanism is not necessarily a religion, more of a way of life. I had a spiritual teacher in India who was Hindu, but she was also a healer and a shaman.<br>  <br>  Shaman work with nature and the Divine to bring peace and healing into the world. Anyone can become a shaman with proper training and with an honest desire to help the world. <br>  <br>  Shaman believe in unity, in balance, in peace, and in compassion. They work to make this world a more harmonious, unified place.<br>  <br>  Email my Ymail account any specific questions and I will try to answer them.|`|pqveENjUaa	True Shamans, which are reserved to a specific culture, are spiritual healers. What everyone refers to as a shaman can be almost anyone who uses nature as a base for spirituality. <br>  <br>  As a neo-shaman, I believe in the utilization of the elements and the spirits for healing, strengthening, or destruction.

I never thought anything was wrong with my skin or my hair until I came to the U.S. and was criticize for it. However that only made me a stronger person, it made me want to be more beautiful to prove that dark skin is beautiful. I would suggest you just take care of yourself and love yourself, inside and out. You will become more radiant and beautiful because of your confidence.<br>  <br>  Lacking self-confidence isn't going to get you anywhere in life. Once you begin to love and respect yourself you will naturally attract more positive people. Also those people saying those negative things about you are insecure themselves, their only doing that to make themselves feel better.<br>  <br>  Look at Tomiko Fraser (model) she dark skin and absolutely flawless in my opinion at least:<br>  <a href="http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2006/07/27/0000417695/DSCF0700.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2006/07/27/...</a><br>  <br>  Here's a beautiful African (Senegalese) model with dark skin I think she's gorgeous as well:<br>  <a href="http://dakarfabulafricana.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/seynabou-3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://dakarfabulafricana.files.wordpres...</a><br>  <br>  another gorgeous African model with very dark skin:<br>  kinee diouf:<br>  <a href="http://images.fashionmodeldirectory.com/model/000000081279-kinee_diouf-fullsize.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.fashionmodeldirectory.com/...</a>|`|CS4MVhsfaa	Hi, Bunnie!<br>  <br>  Let me guess.

Confidence is everything.  Ever since I started being confident, I've had no problem getting a date.  People either make fun of you for what's different about you, or they think it's beautiful.  Personally, I think dark black skin is really beautiful!  In fact, the guy I'm crushing on right now is really dark skinned.  And I'm really light skinned.
