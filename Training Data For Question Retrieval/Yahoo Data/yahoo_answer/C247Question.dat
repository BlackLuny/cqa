20090202105128AAA8Yzf	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Did anyone like Yellowcard before 2000?	Did anyone listen to Yellowcard before Ryan Key joined Yellowcard in 2000, while Ben Dobson and Todd Clarry were still in. It was a completely different style. I picked up the Where We Stand album and I thought it was pretty good. I wasn't expecting the hardcore punk style, and it really surprised me how much the band changed directions when Ryan joined.      Anyways, I was just wondering if anyone heard any of their older music and what they thought of it. (the old was good, but I like their newer stuff better though)

20090202105834AAEi2nX	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Better action film...MI3 or Live Free or Die Hard?	In your opinion, what do you think is the overall better action movie between 'MI3' and 'Live Free or Die Hard'? Also, please explain what one had the better action scenes and say your favorite sequence in each. It's pretty hard cause I like both of these two alot. I would probably lean a little more towards Live Free because I've been a HUGE Die Hard fan before the Mission Impossible films...and I just love every film in the series although each MI3 is still pretty good.       My favorite action scenes:      Live Free- It's really hard to choose so I'll say the top 3.   1. Fighter Jet/Truck- I know it's over the top, but I just love it when the jet just shoots the missles and blows the sh*t out of the truck with it's machine guns! Awesome! And of course when Mcclane jumps off the jet and slides down the freeway causing the jet to blow up behind him!       2. Helicopter chase/Tunnel- It's a good scene but in my opinion the whole 'chase' part with the chopper should have been longer than a minute cause it sort of stops once they're in the tunnel. But it's still cool when he jumps the car into the helicopter and it explodes!      3. Apartment Shootout- I like this scene cause it's sadly the only real shootout in the film. When the bad guy (I know there was like 3 but they died quick) is shooting the walls with the machine gun that was pretty intense. Like the chopper scene, the shootout wasn't long enough maybe like a minute worth of shooting back at each other but still nice! The apartment blowing up causing the guy to hit the wall was funny/cool but I noticed Mcclane didn't fire the rifle he picks up at ALL which is a little disappointing.....weird!      Now it's your turn guys, and be descriptive please. P.S. MI3 also had good action scenes, but I liked Live Free better.

20090202111631AA0fM7j	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Between Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, and Academy (Oscar) Awards which gets the most hype?	Is it more prestigious to be nominated for and win and Academy (Oscar) Award or to be recognized with an award from the Screen Actor's Guild or the Golden Globes? I still think the Oscar is the only one the media really cares about in the end which is kind of disappointing because the Academy seems to overlook so many movies these days with effective acting and plot whether they are independent or popular among fans who pay to see the films. I think the Oscars is more about popularity then substance so it's about what the people on the Academy care about more than what the film critics think or even the movie goers themselves so lots of people get left out. The Academy Awards and the Grammy Awards are popularity contests: whoever has the most connections and gets the most attention wins, as opposed to whoever puts in the most emotional convincing performance with their skills which each person might vary on. Like how The Piano got the award in 1993 over Jurassic Park and Menace II Society or how Aliens was skipped over in 1986. I think the films that are very emotionally compelling should get consideration but I know compelling can mean different things to different people, let alone the guys on the Academy doing the voting. Still some people feel those voters are narrow minded and not open to new things so they vote for the same kinds of films every year by similar actors. The popularity contest concept is also a shout out to when Mariah Carey won the Best R&B Song & Best R&B Album Grammy back in 2002 over Amerie (whom also has a dynamite voice by the way). Mariah was already known too from the early 90s so I think she got more attention and praise because most people had heard more of her music in the mainstream already then they did Amerie so I think usually it comes down to connections and exposure which can be like gambling in a way: you got one random shot but you don't know what'll happen until matters are resolved: you might win or you might lose.

Pancho le dijo al Juez:      -Permítame explicarle Sr Juez como sucedieron los hechos.       Soy amigo de los novios y fungí como padrino de bodas.       Es costumbre en nuestro pueblo que el padrino baile la primera pieza con la novia.       La bailé, pero como siguió la música, pues bailé la segunda y la tercera.       Y de repente, Babalucas, el novio, le propinó una tremenda patada a la novia en el mero centro de las pompis.      El juez dijo:      -?Que barabaridad!, le debió haber dolido muchísimo      -?Claro que si!,  -respondió Pancho-       !!! ME QUEBRó TRES DEDOS !!!      Saludos

El detective cumple con su cometido, vuelve e informa.      "Martínez sale normalmente al mediodía coge su coche, va a su casa a almorzar, luego le hace el amor a su mujer, se fuma uno de sus excelentes habanos y vuelve a trabajar".      Responde el director:   "?Ah, bueno, menos mal, no hay nada malo en todo eso!      Luego el detective pregunta: ?Puedo tutearlo, se?or?    Sorprendido el director responde: "Si, como no".   Y el detective dice:   "Te repito: Martínez sale normalmente al mediodía, coge tu coche, va a tu casa a almorzar, luego le hace el amor a tu mujer, se fuma uno de tus excelentes habanos y vuelve a trabajar".

20090204165908AAjDw7X	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Why won't my brother get a job instead of running around the house all day, telling me news?	Every freaking minute, he runs to my room or wherever I am in my house, telling me news. He loves telling me about what company is firing people, and how many, among other stupid news. He's one of those people that's obsessed with ghetto people and rap stars. He was showing me one of these videos about Bow Wow ripping on Soulja Boy for having a Gallardo, instead of a Murcielago...you should find it, it's one of the most ignorant clips on the Youtube. He loves it. He's always talking stupid like ghetto people too...he thinks anyone with money is super-powerful and awesome.      He's so embarrassing. He goes around town telling people he's going to buy a party store or a franchise, even though he's broke and gets money from my dad. He's been telling people he's going to move to California and buy a business.       He gets hostile whenever you ask him where he's going to get the money. He doesn't have the money, and I think he's just plain crazy. His life is embarrassing to me, he doesn't want to grow up.      I can't even ask him why he doesn't try to find a job. He's almost 33, has an MBA, but doesn't like to work. He wanted to be a doctor when he was younger, but it didn't work out. I think it affected him, he always walks around like he's high and mighty. He only looks for jobs that pay 6 figures, which is why he's still unemployed.      I'm really worried that if I move to get this job I'm looking for, he'll move in with me and try to sponge off of me. What should I do? I think someone needs to teach him how to grow up and be a responsible man.

20090204154734AAlStmj	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you think I'm wrong for not liking her?	I've gone to school with this girl for about 8 years (i couldnt take her bullshi* anymore so I left) But every year she would do the same shi*. She would be nice to everyone for about.. a month. Then she would like turn all my friends against me and no one would talk to me. So I was in a bad mood and forced to hang out with the guys in my class. (only like one of the people who went on her side was a real friend...sort of) All of them would make fun of me constantly except for my friend since i was 2 but she still wouldnt hang out with me.. so she did this every year and it always got worse she just hated me for no apparent reason. So i switched schools just to get away from all the drama. About a week after i switched so did she but to a different school. Well our two schools were going against each other in football and i saw her there and you she called me a bit** and i was just like im not going to even bother so just leave me alone. Then this year the spelling bee thing was at her school and she came up to me and she was laughing with all her friends and stuff and my friend (mentioned earlier, she and a few others from my school also changed because the last school was crap.) was with me and was like "whats your problem." they just laughed again and she called me a bitc* and i was really mad because she called my friend a sl*t so i said "Well i would call you a whor* but no one is stupid enough to do you fat ugly as*"    So am I wrong to hate this girl or do you agree with me?         and also she's going to the same freaking high school what am i supposed to do? i dont want to do something bad and get in trouble or expelled because of her stupid shi*

Souvenez-vous et à un moment donné l'un des deux dit "si vous quittez le plateau je reste alors". Et l'autre lui répond "Alors je reste aussi !" "Bon à ce moment là je m'en vais !" Et ainsi de suite. Leur nom ne me revient plus... Ni celui de l'émission. Mais cette scène est ultra connue, mythique ! Il faut que je la retrouve sur You Tube mais tous les éléments clés me sont sortis de l'esprit. Merci du coup de main !

The reason I am asking is because it has been confirmed that next season will be the last season for "Smallville" and since the series began that had a rule that they would not let Clark fly just yet. It makes you wonder if they will suspend that rule next season and let him fly since it could be the last season for the series. And one more thing, if next season is truly the last season for "Smallville", what will the CW put in its place. Will they either put a Superman series based on the events of "Smallville" or a different DC superhero show?

Other times he would be very nice, smile a lot and sweet. He even  literally seems to have two-faces to go along with his personalities sometimes he can look hot and professional-like and other times he won't even look like the same guy ,but more youthful and innocent. I'm assuming he has some major Gemini placements in his chart. What do you think?

20090205103503AASNMjT	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Why is everyone blaming Bikini Girl (Katrina Darrell) for Rose Flack leaving?	If you go on the American Idol website and go on the message boards, everyone is blaming Katrina for Rose leaving.       I don't think that is fair because Rose sucked and she forgot the words to the song. She wasn't that great before either when she was solo.       And the group wasn't that great either. Except for Katrina.
20090205102312AAgOSDP	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Who else is mad that Bikini Girl (Katrina Darrell) got booted from American Idol last night?	I loved Bikini Girl. She was my favorite. She made American Idol interesting and she could actually sing. I mean, you don't have to be a Whitney Houston especially if she goes into the pop music genre.       I loved that she was always able to get a rise out of Kara and Paula. Kara would make little comments like "bring your pole tomorrow" and when Katrina didn't hug the black girl, Jasmine, when the rest of her group did, Kara said "i guess she is ready for her closeup. God what a bytch".       I am so upset that she got booted. But I hope that she will be brought back as a wild card.       Bikini Brigade 09'

20090204235602AAsM0AA	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	My girlfriend calls me "daddy"...is it weird? Please see details?	My wonderful girlfriend (a good chance she will be my future wife, too) likes to call me "daddy". First, let me start by saying that it doesn't bother me. It's not just a sexual playful name like most people would probably assume.      I think there is a deeper significance to it. You see, her parents were killed in a car accident a few years ago, and since then she hasn't had anyone to protect her and take care of her. She has had to 'fend for herself. She says that I provide her with safety and security.      In an unusual way, I actually love the way it makes me feel, to have her call me daddy. I am NOT the controlling type...I'm actually the complete opposite. So don't think it's because I have control issues. Our relationship is completely equal and there is so much mutual respect. No one controls the other.      But I think it's because I have seen how much pain she has gone through in life, I just want to reach out and hold her so close and protect her, because she doesn't have that kind of person in her life anymore. I love calling her my "baby girl". I love making her feel safe, almost like a parent would for a child.      So what do you think?

20090205000035AAeMXIP	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What goes around comes around,true?	ok, I spent 2 years working for my boss's son on this project.   I worked my a$$ off everyday and he kept pushing and pushing to no end. Anyway I learned to be patient and to respect him anyway although he never respected me and treated me like a machine. Forcing me to stay after working hours and never get an overtime charge.   He never replied on my mails, he always belittled me and made fun of my work. I did an excellent job but he never appreciated that. He went to France and bought this new software and bought a new server for his other private business, he bought the latest and the newest softwares to manage his other business, although this current project we were working with, needed more than that, and its server always failed.      Anyways, one day I heard that he had a huge fight with his dad and that he stole money from his dad for his new business and when his dad knew about it, he forced him to leave his work at his dad's company and he was kicked out!!      He literally tortured me and made my life miserable and now that I heard that..I think it's the best revenge ever :)      He doesn't get to work on this project anymore coz from the beginning, he wasn't even serious about it and I think he only did it to show his dad that he's a good son and he's taking care of his dad's business but in the end he was just stealing from his dad.      I used to think of ways to get back at that guy, but in the end God took care of it.      What do you think??

20090205104642AAVXDgL	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	I fell out with a Pisces friend for 7 months?	I fell out with my Pisces friend about 7 months ago and basically she called me selfish and me, not being there for her and that is a complete lie and seemed like an excuse to dump me. I never spoke to her and I was upset about it but then I got over it cos she was too much hassles and she was too..just much for me.       Then December 08 she added me in Facebook, i'm like wtf? i added her anyway but she's the kinda girl who'd show off, rub in my face like she's having fun without me or seeking attention. I know her other game of how she would want me to crack up and apologise to her with something I've never ever done to her. I did that in the past before but not anymore. She's not gonna get what she wants.      I've there for her all the way and she ditched me, so i thought, fine, forget her.       All I'm asking is do you think she's up to something or genuinely would want to get in touch with me? Sorry for all Pisces-i'm sure you're all great but it's just this girl i don't trust.      What do you all think? It'd be nice for a water sign person to answer this too! X

20080928012214AAl6VBv	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	How can i fix my lisp for singing?	Well, i've had a lisp for my whole life now, and my problem is with "s", "th", and sometimes i dont pronounce the ending letters of words. Although in the past year, i got speech therapy, and it helped, but i still have problems. Like now, when i say "th" or "s", a lot of the time its forced, i always think about not making my voice sound weird...      That comes to the next question, i've recently gotten into bass, and i'm planning on joining my friends band, and they need a bassist and a singer. I can sing well in the fact that i can hold notes, and i can follow tones well, and i'm planning on starting to train my vocals, but my lisp... thats what gets in the way =(      my voice sounds weird when i sing though because of the lisp, so all i really have to do is fix it      so like i said before, i took speech therapy lessons, they taught me how to do everything right and everything, but it only lasted 2 sessions because they thought i was fine with it at that point(cause i was trying my hardest at the last lesson to talk right, and i was talking slowly)... so what should i do now? I know how to actually pronounce th and s, but i cant do it without thinking about it... So what should i try now?      (btw im a guy, and the band im joining is a hardcore/metal/punk band)

20090205100657AAcbiTc	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Anyone Else Hate The So-Called "Twilight" Fans?	Does anyone else hate these people that are suddenly fans of "Twilight" and claim to be number one fans just because they've seen the movie?  I've come across LOADS of people who say they are major fans, but they didn't even know it was based on a book!  Even thought the film has practically no similarities compared to the book, except the names, its still BASED on it.      I'm not talking about all those "Twilight" movie fans, but its the ones that claim to be fans of "Twilight", that know nothing, that get on my nerves.      Stephenie Meyer should be praised for her writing of "Twilight", and people are getting a completely different vision from the movie, then say the film is better!   Don't get me wrong, I love the books, I read them over and over again, and i'm not saying I don't like the movie, either.  Its just these "Twilight Fans" who know nothing about the book, still claiming to be fans!      I also hate the girls that think the film is so amazing, but it is just because they fancy Robert Pattinson, and claim to be in "Team Edward" because of it!      Sorry, but I just wanted to see if anyone else felt the same about it, as I am sure there are loads of "Twilight" lovers who are fans, simply due to the book.      Please comment on how you feel about it too, thanks!      .*love*.

All i can find is live stuff; I did find 'Can't Stop' but i was looking for 'By The Way', 'Dani California' and 'Under The Bridge'. If anyone could send me a link it would be much appreciated. Have they taken all their videos off Youtube? Because they used to be there..? Thanks.

She's back on drugs again   Even though she knows it ain't right   She can't even call up her friends   And say "help me save my life"   She's so ashamed of herself that she's come full circle   Nobody understands what it's like to   Be this girl   So she disappeared, and she   Wasn't clear, and she   Didn't say where she was going      [Chorus]   Save my life, won't you help me   Save my life, won't you help me   Save my life, won't you hear me   Save my life, won't you help me      She had the man of her dreams   And some success   And she was so happy, and looking well   It was this one dark night, that she   Slipped   And then the next morning that she   Felt like a piece of ****   So she's hanging out, and she's   With the crowd, and she's   Travelin' where the wind is blowing      [Chorus]      And he's a real good guy and he   Wants to save her 'cause he's   More than been there all before   And she's so confused and his heart is breaking and he   Dreams she's knocking on his door

There's these high school girls with tough attitudes and the one girl from their group commits suicide. They read through her journal and find out that she was being raped at work by some older guy for quite some time. One of the girls, I think she's hispanic, has a baby. Another girl, I remember her wearing combat boots and a skirt, tells the rest of her friends that she too was raped. The guy who raped her goes to their high school and they spray paint "raper" on his car. In a bathroom stall, they make a list of guys to avoid and other girls from the school add on to it. They go to the office where their deceased friend worked and, on the sidewalk, they beat up the guy who raped her.

None of the characters are who they should be.  There's not even a plot to the show for people to enjoy.  It used to be about the Jim/Pam/Karen thing, but now it's about nothing.  It's just a whole bunch of adults acting like 5 year-olds.       That last episode after the superbowl was probably one of the worst episodes ever.  Please tell me there are people out there who feel the same way.  What's wrong with the writers this year and why are these episodes so HORRIBLE?!?

20090205114044AAIEMZC	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Scorpio Test? or Scorpio Push?	Ok this guy ( a Scorpio ), have been dealing with each other for a long time. My friends are always in our biz and they are always going back to him with stuff that either i've said but usually that they've heard. He recently asked me to do something, I care about him a lot and he likes me to do what he tells me to ( there are some things he is right about), but I just didn't do it. So recently we had an argument, again, and he said he was done because he is tired of people coming up to him asking him questions. He wouldn't let me talk and kept hanging up on me, finally he listened to me and everything was straightened out. I told him what was what. He kept saying that he doesn't like it when I don't do what he asks, and that all of this could have been avoided if I did what he asked of me.. For some reason I think he is trying to push me away because just yesterday we were fine and laughing, even though I know he really hates people asking him about what we do, and so do I..that is what I had to get him to understand. He is a Scorpio and he doesn't believe that I am faithful to him, he thinks I am a whore even though he should know that I'm not, he was my first and he knows how I feel about sex. So is he working me? Is he testing me?....it's just weird that we were just fine, and today he's saying he's done and see him next lifetime, and then when I explain things to him..everything is back to normal?...We haven't been talking, I work and he is looking for a job with the economy the way it is, and we'd been arguing, and we NEVER argue I don't like confrontation, yet I think he shouldn't answer the phone when we are arguing because it only gets worse, but he answers and listens then says bye, and I call back and he picks up and I'm like well what are you doing?....I'm 21..Is he testing me or pushing me away???...Thank You.

Your current decisions, though, are not as crucial as they may seem because they are part of a long-term process that is redefining the structure of your current relationships. Keep in mind that magnetic Venus is squaring your key planet Pluto now, intensifying your feelings as the boundary between friendship and romantic love is tested.

He was not pleased with the level of comfort in Hell, and began to redesign and build improvements. After awhile, they had toilets that flush, air conditioning, and escalators. Everyone grew very fond of him.       One day God called to Satan to mock him, "So, how's it going down there in Hell?"       Satan replied, "Hey, things are great. We've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next."God was surprised, "What? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake. He should never have gotten down there in the first place. Send him back up here."       "No way," replied Satan. "I like having an engineer, and I'm keeping him."       God threatened, "Send him back up here now or I'll sue!"       Satan laughed and answered, "Yeah, right. And just where are YOU going to get a lawyer?"

20090412131925AAB84i9	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What's the name of this movie?	I saw scenes of it once as a kid and I'm curious to know what it's about. A popular actor plays the role of this dude who has this boy with him and they're on the run. It's somewhere in the south. He ties up this black family, attempts to shoot them. They go from one place to the next and in the end there's a standoff with the cops where I think the guy is killed. That's pretty much all I remember.

20070105134329AAy34UB	Entertainment & Music;Music	New to electric guitar from acoustic?	I've played piano for about 12 years or so and acoustic guitar for maybe 4 months. I just got an electric guitar a few weeks ago. It probably sounds stupid but for most of the time when I first got it I played it unplugged just to get used to the feel of it. But plugged in now, I find it completely different than an acoustic in alot of ways. The things that really irritate me are the way it amplifies any little mistake you make. It seems like it requires you to play more carefully than an acoustic. Also it seems like I can't play anywhere near as fast as I can on piano but this is probably just an acquired skill. Anybody else find it tricky to migrate from acoustic to electric?

Because if he doesn't he will lose it bad. Then some one sells him a TV with only one channel, and that would be channel #777.  Once he turns to it, he then sees his children in heaven laughing running and just having a blast. The title of the Movie would be  Channel Heaven. would that be a good movie to watch or not?

We've seen them in the magazine etc....     But are they that much more important then us that you take out special amount of time to look at their movies , read thier books , download their songs, etc... why not use that amount of energy and concertration  and put it towards your family , or your close friends or even in sckool   ?      I'd say we all deserve to be on T.V  because we are all specail as those who are if not more special .  We all come from different backgorunds  why worship the age and name  of  that  cetrian favorite celebrity that you  adore ? Why don't you gave a damn about your our backgorund and name , and location?         I get so sick when I personally find myself gaving a damn about  celebrities .
