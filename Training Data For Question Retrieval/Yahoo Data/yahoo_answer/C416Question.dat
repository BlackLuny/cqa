20090225024652AAHy4UQ	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	Weird Shower, Dishwasher like or what?	ive just moved into a new house which i just bought and the real estate agent told me that the last person living there was a bit different. i found that the shower isn't really a normal shower. when i went into the bathroom i found a large machine with a manual attached to it. when i opened the machine it looks like a dishwasher with racks inside. skimming over the quick guide of the manual it shows a person placing what looks like a dish-washing tablet in a dispenser and a tray of dirty dishes on the rack and the person climbing into the machine below the dishes, pressing this big red button on the side and then it shows the door shut with a green tick and in brackets it says MACHINE WASHING. it then shows a pic of the dishes and person being rubbed down by wet tea towels and sponge cloths. it seems like an extra large dishwasher that washes people, should i attempt this machine? when i have a shower because there is no other source for me to have a shower.

The kitchen counters were or looked like they were brand new.  A few months back, I was using a stove top smoker to smoke a salmon fillet.  I picked the smoker up and set it on a fabric hot pad.  2" of the hot smoker touched my counter and left a burn.      It's just slightly discolored (no actual mark) and I can't get rid of it.  This counter has always been so easy to clean.  Soft scrub, plain soap and water, bleach if needed.  No one else notices, but me.  I let the stripe soak in full strength bleach over night and that didnt even help.  Right now, I have it "marinating" in Comet Cleaner.      Any other ideas?  Maybe even to lighten it up a bit?  I can't even come up with a good description of the color as it's so light.  It's not yellow or carmel, but kind of both.  If you were 2 feet away from it, you couldn't see it.  It just happens to be right in front of my coffee pot which I use every day.      No, I won't move my coffee pot, but it's a thought.

My best friend has asked me to help her decorate her baby-on-the-way's bedroom in a camouflage decor.  She plans to use the bedding seen at the link at the bottom because her husband is a big deer hunter.  I'm usually really good at decorating rooms, but I can't really think of decor items that are more 'baby' than adult hunter.  I'll probably get a few wooden letters and cover them in the same fabric to spell his name out on the wall, but I need other BABY themed ideas for this room.  This is what I've got in my head so far:  wallpaper a wall with the same fabric, cover the light switch covers,  cover the changing pad and rocking chair pad, framing either leaves or real wildlife feathers, I've even thought about putting pinecones in a basket...  The only problem is that all of those ideas don't really have anything to do with a baby's room.  Those are the same ideas I would use if I were decorating a spare adult bedroom in a hunting theme...  See my problem?  I just need some creative baby ideas!

So that their gardens over look ours.      We would like to build a 2 storey extension, but this means that one our neighbours would have a wall to the right of them. basically if they look out their window they would see a wall approx 6 metres long, down the right hand length of their garden. (hope that makes sense!) Height wise, the same height as their own roof.      Would this be a problem with right of light? In all other directions, she see's fields and woods.

20090225055018AASrFxd	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	How much to convert a building to a 2 chair barber shop?	It is difficult to find a barber shop or salon anywhere in my area that is for sale.      The only things that I can find are large salons that cost a LOT of money and is more than what I want, need, and can handle.      I am trying to figure out how much it would cost, and how difficult it would be to convert a building into a small 2 chair barber shop.      It dosen't matter to me if it's free-standing, or a store front.      The main problem would be getting the sinks.      A barber shop by law has to have a sink and a wall mirror.      Wall mirror not difficult but putting in a sink may be.      So basically I have two questions.      1) How much would it cost to put in two sinks in a building? (If I hired someone from the phone book)      2) How difficult would it be.? (I mean, can I just get a couple of friends together and do it or do you need a licensed plumber or something)

20090203142748AAwLMhi	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Is my home worth more torn down for parts?	After driving past another bare patch of land that just few days earlier had a beautiful old barn, it made me wonder.  Is my home worth more torn apart?  But I dont know what kind of wood was used.  How can I find that out? If i take a piece ( no problem getting a piece or maybe just a some good quality pics would do? ) to say a lumber yard could they tell me?   Any one know what those barn taker downers pay for the wood?   My house is plank construction.  Three inch think 12 to 16 inch wide wood planks from cellar sill to attic to second story to hold roof.  Oh yeah the outside walls are two plank thick.   It would make sense the house was made from local trees (built 1882 in the allegheny mts. )  They are not pine or oak my neighbor thinks they are elm? Elm?? I never heard of any thing being made from elm...even old furniture is not made from elm   So to re-cap who can tell me what kind of wood the planks are made of..where can i go to find out    and   How much do those re-claimers pay?   Maybe there is a web site that shows examples of different grains of wood to help identify?

20090203141841AA6shTb	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Short hair clogged main line and landlord wants me to pay.?	I live in a basement apt and 2 weeks ago our toilet wouldn't flush and our bath tub would back up any time we or anyone above us used water. I tried using a closet auger on our bathtub drain and toilet at first as well as plunging the toilet and nothing I did worked. He got 2 of his plumbers out here to look at it and they said it was the main line. A few days later they show up for the main line and fix it. The landlord said they pulled out clumps of short hair and blamed our rabbit. We have bathed the rabbit in the tub, a total of 3 times in about 10 months and while I'm sure some hair got into the drain, the majority of it was taken out of the tub and thrown in the garbage. If it was indeed our bunny alone, wouldn't that have also clogged our inside drain (where neither I or the plumbers turned up anything)? Can I ask him to prove our bunny was the sole cause?
