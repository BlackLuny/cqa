NbdZoxxQaa	Are you talking about moving away your senior year? that I do not recommend. I know that one more year of high school seems like forever and not even worth it  sometimes, but moving to a different place at that age is really tough. It is hard moving away in general and to go at that age when you may not be ready to fly the nest is even tougher. Paying for everything yourself is more difficult than it may seem, and you really should just enjoy your last year at home. I know you said that you are scared of losing him, but being long distance is a great way to see how strong a relationship is. It lets you build a trusting relationship on a whole new level. If I were you I would stay with my family.
RzaP9bQmaa	I have yet come across someone who has managed to convert a "player", You hear about the women who marry these so called men have children with them think that everything is alright to only find out that there so-called husband is seeing at least another 2 girls on the side.  If you think that you are in love with a "player" then hun as quick as you can try and fall out of it now, I know it sounds harsh, but the earlier you do this the less heart-ache and pain you will suffer in the future.   <br>  <br>  Think if you take back a cheating man and allow him to get away with it, then he is always going to have that thought in the back of his mind that he will always get away with it and carry on cheating.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	HaHA is right hon.<br>  You can not <br>  "change or fix" him.He screws around because he can.The girls are all lining up to take their turn thinking if they give him a taste of honey moon, he will wake up next to them the next morning "in love"!<br>  AH!<br>  Never has happened and it isn't going to.Let him have sex with you and you will end up like all his exes,maybe with a baby to boot.<br>  Use your head and flush your fantasies down the toilet hon.He is the kind of guy the girls flock to and drop their panties for and he is asking"why settle for one piece of candy in the sotre when I can have it all?" and "Why buy the cow when all the cows are shoving free milk on me?"
TvYa0rmbaa	just ask her. <br>  you got nothing to loose :)|`|hKV7esQcaa	Tell her how u feel about her and be honest =]|`|gui4YVkKaa	hmm, just be ur self dude! be calm, cool, and collected, take a breah, and YOU make the 1st move, cuz a guy should tell the girl first, and if u REALLY like her, you guys will be a great couple, and have an awesome relationshiP :) :D I HOPE I HELPED
WxSQA1ZKaa	It sounds like you are doing the right things. There is really nothing more you can do except let your friend know you are there for her and supporting her and that you are on her side and willing to listen. You can always try to cheer her up by bringing her a small present (chocolate, or whatever she likes). Hugs are good too.|`|IHDVQs3kaa	There's not a lot you can do apart from what you are currently doing and that's just being there.  No-one can take away another's worry about illness in the family, but just reinforce the fact that you are there for her whenever.  Maybe the two of you should catch a couple of movies, or, try and think of something fun  to do.  Even 5 minutes of not worrying can be a help.|`|ewQaf29oaa	You did the perfect thing for her-just letting her know that you're there when she needs you. Don't pressure her to talk to you, allow her to use you as her fun friend who helps her have fun, and when she wants to talk-let her and be sympathetic. You've done a great job already.|`|AA11982696	aw ur a sweet girl. youre doing the best you can right now, just keep being supportive.|`|4KTG7N1Paa	it depends on the kind of person she is, some times just being with family helps, but you can all was try to help get it off her mind, go out to movies, go shopping that kind of thing.|`|sIKjralSaa	Get something speical for that family|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	just be there when she needs you|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	just be there for her, ask her if there is anything that you can do to help, if she talks try not to interrupt just listen and be there when she needs you
9O0fPOV3aa	Hell yes. Dude, that sound a little bit serious. Regardless if his parents are there, if you care for this person you will go check up on him.|`|TKdDIu0Waa	well!this is a real tricky question,he's into drugs from what you said,try his home number,and pretend to be one of his boyfriend and then talk to him,if things don't work out,dump him!!!sorry to say this,but then it is not worth having a boyfriend who is into drugs!!!|`|O0cHWym9aa	I think you should wait and give him some time. He will contact you  when he wants. There is nothing you could do if he wants to use drugs<br>  and by going to his house you make matters worse.|`|NQwljNOoaa	If the only time he wants to see you at his house is when his parents are away, then it's time you rethink this whole relationship.  Remember that you can't control anyone but yourself, so if he is doing drugs, then there is nothing you can do.  Sounds to me that he could benefit from some professional counseling.  If doing drugs is the way he handles his depression, a professional would show him a more positive way to deal with negativity instead of doing drugs.  If he doesn't call, then I see nothing wrong with going over to his house to see how he is doing.  If he gets angry about that, then I say turn around and walk away for good.  You don't need that in your life.  You deserve better than to be treated badly.|`|LYeAQKW8aa	Why can't you go over to his house when his parents are there??? Do they know he's in a relationship?
cdSYbMzkaa	hahaha you get scared of other big cars... kid your in an escalade u can run any car over!!!|`|SLN4m6wNaa	Wow you are spoilt... just kiddin! When I was your age I was helpin my dad fix his car. haha, funny that I still think about it. I drive an Escalade now btw :)<br>  <br>  Dude, just ignore all the haters on the road cos you will surely run into some who want to tailgate you, etc.|`|LYeAQKW8aa	You won't die. That's reassuring, right?
da5wRmlRaa	how queer!<br>  yeah, it's me. <br>  queer.<br>  <br>  okay, about sasha.<br>  well if you honesty believe that you seem like a follower, make friends with other groups.<br>  you can't just stick to one place, then you will actually BECOME a follower.<br>  and god knows you don't want that.<br>  plus, who the hell said she's our gateway to popularity?<br>  you twist up everything. :(<br>  <br>  back to your questions,<br>  you just need to think about it.<br>  what do YOU, as a human being want for yourself?<br>  how will it effect the people around you?<br>  how will it effect your life personally?<br>  you need to come to a decision, whether or not other people agree with you.<br>  i know it's really tough, i honestly do. <br>  but some people just have different opinions.<br>  so i'm asking you to sit down and just run your mind through it.<br>  <br>  and whatever you do, remember who your real friends are.<br>  the ones that will stay with you no matter what.<br>  it doesnt matter what other people think if you know you have real freinds.<br>  people that trust you and will always be there for you.<br>  if being labeled as a follower is the price of your friendship,<br>  what do you choose?<br>  <br>  think about it.|`|jUxwbLTtaa	That was long. don't abandon her, become one with her. start acting like her. Try not to beat up though, try to slip your way out of that. Act funny and crazy, but no violence.|`|6kTFFT55aa	Just move on...she has absolutly, ( the girl who came up to you and asked about " The leader''), no idea what's going on in your little group. Yea, I know but it's hard. Take time to view the situation from outside of the group. It'll make a big effect on your decisions...
r4hJTqMAaa	1.) Don't degrade yourself, and give those people the satisfaction of knowing that you agree with what they are saying behind your back. You know yourself better than anyone else; never compromise your happiness to gain acceptance---especially in an environment that is polluted with such ignorance. Be a strong, confident individual. When people see that you are happy being the person that you are, they will give you the respect that you rightfully deserve.<br>  2.) To make friends, just be yourself. This is all you can do. Pursue opportunities that will enable you to share your interests with others, whether it be participating in a sport, extracurricular activity, or engaging in conversation. As a generalization, people will either love you for you, or hate you for you. It's a fact of life. Stand up straight, hold your head up high, and don't pay acknowledgment or the time of day to those people or their malice.<br>  Only go to the dance if you feel genuinely comfortable doing so. I hope this helped you! Good luck!|`|dU3O4Wa9aa	WOW IM EXACTLY LIKE THAT!<br>  <br>  people tell me to try talking to new people... but if that is a dance u want to go to ? and your friends won't be there? just go! u might make new friends there. and im sure you'll have a great time :]<br>  <br>  hope that helped?|`|yiZqEzqSaa	they only don't like you because you haven't shown them you got balls !!!turn up on your own and show them you have!<br>  and if you've got the bottle to do it you'll probably end up getting some new friends.<br>  be interesting to know why your friends are not going? maybe you need new ones anyway,<br>  it takes allot of guts to do that and that's what the other kids will see and they will probably tease you for it, but in the back of "all" their minds they will all be thinking they've got guts" guaranteed!! it will earn you some respect.|`|ihEMQKIdaa	i say you should go..who knows, you might have lots of fun!

JAL0HMWiaa	He Likes you alot & he told his friends<br>  now there pushing for him to do something ! <br>  goodluckK :) :) :)|`|zrKuaiDLaa	I bet so! Really I do! I need more information to make a good decision, but it seems like it...|`|Bi5i5cvTaa	yes he likes you!!!!!<br>  talk to him more and if he when he looks at you smile<br>  at him instead of quickly looking away<br>  if it has been awhile and he STILL hasn't asked u out<br>  just go up to him and say "hey lets go to the movies sometime."|`|pMmikgYVaa	Yeah he likes. Guys tend to do that (push a bud into his crush). He's making it pretty obvious. His friends too and if hes trying to keep it a secret its not working lol well yeah he likes you, and if you like him back then maybe its time you start flirting back =)<br>  Hope i helped|`|16HqzRcfaa	sounds like he likes you!!!|`|Bv5dJQMFaa	he realy likes you but is shy!|`|Yv6pa3QAaa	Yeah that's what my guy would do lol but the same stuff carried on for literally almost four years so you have to know when to draw the line and think seriously is this going anywhere?  is this good for me?  but you sound young and innocent so it seems like a good thing and he totally likes you and i doubt he is like that to other girls.. but guys like that are really hard to read and i dont think any of us girls like mixed signals so just don't get too caught up in it =) what is meant to happen, will happen|`|BaXSNq3aaa	well , from the looks of it. he maybe does! you should try talking to him whenever you get the chance to. also take the time to get to know the person. who knows he might be a great guy that you might like. good luck!|`|kKbega8yaa	It sounds like he does but guys are SO confusing sometimes.|`|G2J5m25Vaa	Well i am not sure but it sounds like it try to talk to him more and if he doesn't make the first move you should do it.|`|0Bi6MufTaa	don't read too much into this kinda stuff, maybe he likes you maybe he doesn't, he will make it clear if he wants to be with you|`|fz7hClveaa	trust me it's really obviouse that he likes i just know these things if a guy looks at you and says weird things to you like he feels uncomfortable then im positive he likes you.|`|XeLZtw20aa	I think he likes you and his friends know it so they are trying to get him to make a move|`|MFlzqiU5aa	yes he does. :]|`|0Tew2jDlaa	aww cmon!!! i thot people my age wer sposed to have those things hard wired into their brains!!! ugh i no i do so wats wrong with you!!! lol jk.<br>  <br>  so uh PHSYEA hes totally flirting with you. constant staring is a huge sign. it may seem creapy and uncomfortable @ some times but u no wat..i kinda like it :) <br>  <br>  so ya hes either a guy slut(or a total retard) and does that to everybody oooorrrrrr he likes u :)|`|WYvN1Bgpaa	it looks like he does but don't be to sure because  when i went out with this guy it was a dear so maybe you should ask him or tell a friend to ask for you!!!and those are sighs so maybe he likes you so give it a try!!|`|i9xeRcAoaa	More than likely|`|CwAhC38Uaa	Be tough sweetie. I think he likes you, but then again, maybe your fly was down. Ask his friend if he likes you. He'll make it clear eventualy.|`|gJPlY1ADaa	I would say he do like you but he is scared or too shy to let you know how he feels. try talking to him but dont just tell him you know he likes you just give him subtle hints(only if you like him).|`|2lCe6yTSaa	I think that there's probably a good chance that he does, get to know him, and maybe it'll be easier to tell.|`|AA10095332	yea he likes you, but is shy and kind of an idiot around his friends. Get him alone somehow, and see how he really is. If he shows more interest, meet him halfway :)<br>  good luck!|`|J4nX1v7faa	he likes you, but he is a creeper...so probably not in your best interest to date him unless you wanna get chopped up into bite sized cheez-its|`|TtM1cA2Saa	It seems to me like he likes you.|`|kZHb7u9Waa	i think he likes you...if you like him then try to pay more attention to you.>>|`|UEJrQ6rQaa	Duh! he does!|`|4Nk6OK7Kaa	tell him you like him very much and you love him|`|fP6KKzFgaa	he likes u he likes you lots|`|DgCgwLYGaa	he likes u just doesn't know how to express it
be40588ae7c28e63b468da0087e4f8f9aa	Are you going to marry her?  <br>  What was the wedding question?|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Get the DNA test.|`|nqINitkmaa	What does her attractiveness have to do with anything?! Why would you have sex with someone when you don't even know their last name? How is this a wedding question? If she is refusing to accept you as a father you can petition the court for a DNA test, I think.|`|Wzws8v8daa	you should do the right thing and find out if this child is yours. it's more than just paying child support, you should be there for your son and have a relationship with him if he is yours. pursue it further. take her to court if you have to. you have a right to know if this child is yours or not.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Get some legal advice on this, I think the court can make her do a DNA to prove if he is your son or not. Remember if you are then its opened up a new life for you and you have to be able to support your child for years to come.|`|E2X6B1Iaaa	why did you have sex with her if you think she is so "unattractive"? I mean, really, get over yourself man. Why does it matter how attractive she is? If she had your baby, you have the responsibility to take care of the boy. If she keeps saying it isn't your baby, it probably isn't. Or maybe even she sees how shallow and ridiculous you are and wants to spare her son.|`|9nJwsSvPaa	he he he sucka!!!!!|`|h70Vb5KMaa	If you didn't want to end up being a parent, you shouldn't have had unprotected sex. Period.<br>  <br>  Now, I think you should keep pushing her to get the DNA/blood test done so that you can know for sure whether the baby is yours or not. It sounds like you want to do the right thing, but just paying child support isn't enough. It'd be in the best interest of the boy if he actually knew and had a life with his father. If you don't like the woman, you don't have to be with her. You can still see him whenever possible and take him to the park and all that fun stuff little kids like to do with their parents. Do please be there for you child, and don't treat him like the mistake you made and just want to go away.

WvOvoxLxaa	You have a very complicated problem. The reason it is so complicated is because you made it that way. Your husband treats you not the best, then another man comes along and shows you some attention and you are so lonely for this that you fall for his story.  He might really like you and want to be with you, but if he respected you he would step aside and let you take care of your marriage. You need to figure out what you want to do with your life, and believe me your husband won't hurt himself, because that would take some work and he doesn't know how to do that. Hey did you know that since you let him sit on his backside and supported him that if you got a divorce you would have to pay him alimony. Hey it would be worth it if you where free to have a good life. Don't stay with someone because they hold something over your head, because usually it isn't any thing more than a feather that couldn't hurt you.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	I strongly recommend marriage counseling for BOTH of you together and additional individual counseling for your husband, and even yourself separately.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	You probably need to leave because you have already train wrecked your marriage by cheating. Your husband should appreciate you, but you should have left before you strayed. You also have started your next relationship off on REALLY bad ground. Be decent and at least tell your husband you have cheated on him before you leave--at the very least he deserves closure.|`|3iNobwVraa	Wow.  Well, I think a good rule of thumb is that you don't leave for someone else.  You leave if you'd rather be alone.  It sounds like maybe you would rather be alone than be with him, and from what you described, I understand.<br>  <br>  But make darn sure you'd rather be alone, because that is most likely the way this turns out.  The statistics are pretty persuasive.  Not that I am saying it doesn't happen, anything is possible, but don't go into something like this without considering that possibility.  And, I would most definitely consider your children.  What wouldn't you sacrifice for them?  If you are like most parents, you would sacrifice even your own life.  Think long and hard about this, and good luck.<br>  <br>  BTW, I really HATE that BS manipulation tactic he used.  Why would anyone want someone to be with them only so they don't hurt themselves?!?  That's asinine--on every level.|`|kdRY3Ulhaa	if your husband is being more attentive because he realises he may lose you ...that should make you stop and think hard before you leave him .....If he really Didn't love you, he would Not be trying to keep you with him....He may have needed this jolt to make him see that you need to know he cares ...Guys mess up ...But he is letting you know he loves you ....give him a second chance.|`|u7LSohRyaa	Do what you think is right. Truly be 'finished' with one relationship before getting into a new one with someone else. I think you're lucky that your husband is willing to change to keep you. My ex just wanted me but wasn't really willing to do anything to keep me. If it's just an act, then it will fall apart, the minute he feels secure with you again. If you don't trust him enough to give him another chance, tell him that it's time to go. It's not his fault. Just make sure you mean it. I know you can fall out of love as easily as falling in love.|`|nP0RcIBoaa	you know we have something in common.<br>  all you have to do is collect all your courage and tell him what you really felt for him. he can accept it, im sure of it. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!<br>  <br>  by the way, how come you get this far? how did you know it's other?|`|YORa3jg3aa	Well, I'm assuming you loved your husband at one point, and i'm guessing he loved you and still may.  The problem is most likely that you two did not show that love effectively to the other, so he doesn't feel appreciated and you don't feel loved.  So, you're going to an outside source for your love.  However, what's to say it won't be like that if you ended up with the other man?  A marriage takes work and commitment, you can't neglect it and then just leave when it gets bad (or you shouldn't).  I suggest you both go to marriage counseling - he will learn to support you and make you feel loved, and you will learn to do the same for him, and then this marriage can work out.  You also need to communicate your needs to him - if you don't feel loved, tell him.  He may be unaware that he needs to put constant effort into making you feel loved.  While you're going through counseling, read "the Five Love Languages" - very helpful book.

Let's just put a "y" on the end of every term of endearment and be cute.*blah* <br>  <br>  Qualities I look for in a boyfriend/husband: Integrity, Stability, a good sized member, Anything positive I guess!|`|ByUS0k8waa	Honesty, Calm, Mature, Stable, and loving. Just like my hubby. Been married three years and still loving every minute of it.|`|rDmMk9Soaa	A big willy.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	Truthfully,honest,works,respectful and kind,good tempered and humorous|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Honesty, charm (genuine not fake), responsible, kindness, humor, love, etc.|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	Trustworthy, Respectful, Kind, Funny, Good Family Man,
7XG5fd5Xaa	I went straight to online. I knew Id be planning my own wedding and paying for it in Oct of this year, my man and I knew what we wanted so we looked online for all the things we wanted. Im sure you could look up wedding planners or in the phone book. Im sure there is a place that does everything for a wedding, if you have the money to do so.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Nobody else I did it all, I did my daughters godfathers too including wedding attire right down to cufflinks.<br>  If you want to do it, then read up on the stages of wedding planning and when you get older advertise your services. Get a portfolio done of places you have decorated, and weddings you have planned.|`|cdL4wzGbaa	Walmart has everything I need.|`|vy3oLsyRaa	I just planned my own wedding.  It wasn't really that hard after all.  Though you'll just need lots of time to plan for it.  Plan things little by little everyday and you'll have a whole list in the end, you'll be deleting a lot (but that's better that way).<br>  <br>  my sister just planned her wedding too and it was really fancy.  she just got ideas here and there and put them together.<br>  <br>  wedding planners are a great help but may be costly too.|`|JjwQMN3laa	Her parents house to see if they would hold up to tradition and pay for everything...|`|aipChC3haa	google "wedding checklists" and you will find it.
yT29OZuvaa	Well it's your own personal opinion. But don't try to control your brother. If you say the wrong things, he might just grow up to hate gay/lesbian relationships. His elders shape his future. Their beliefs will be adapted by him and will turn into his own beliefs, maybe with some minor tweaks. <br>  <br>  If your mom is in a lesbian relationship, just show her that you support her. I imagine one of her greatest fears is having her children hate her for loving another women. You probably just need to get accustomed to this new life style.|`|tbKoPNbDaa	i agree with you. your not wrong to feel this way. i hope everything goes ok for you good luck|`|oU1yUxwwaa	First of all I am not here to tell you that you are right or wrong. Here is my opinion...I think that by you keeping your brother away from it or trying to keep your brother away from it isn't really going to do anything because maybe you can keep him away from it at home but he is going to grow up and leave one day and if he already knows who he is then he wont have a problem with it however it seems like you are having a problem with it. <br>  <br>  Im not telling you that the way you feel is wrong but if you already know who you are then you will be fine. A lot of people feel that way but that is the way your mother is choosing to leave her life. You might not like it but it seems that you can't do anything about it because you are living with her under her roof and you are living bill free so in all honesty you don't really have any problems. Just deal with it until it's time for you to leave or until you can leave.|`|ZRS0C1CXaa	Your brother should know how he feels, you keeping him away from that it is just shielding him of the truth.
I81cNyaKaa	MEEP?!?!?!?!?! Meep, meep, meep!<br>  <br>  <br>  Meep!|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Cut it out!<br>  Yer killin me!!!<br>  <br>  Edit-<br>  I just gotta tell ya:<br>  You guys are GREAT!<br>  My side hurts from laughing so hard.<br>  You make this site fun.<br>  Keep it up..|`|lKBoTN7Vaa	She is just upset you keep running down her batteries is all .....|`|4ssSgfYEaa	Because trolls aren't supposed to play with her sex toys.|`|4OEOxOmPaa	My pocket Rocket needs a Socket!|`|1JVAZbt7aa	how old are u?
d5dKlgEPaa	The right thing would have been to say, "I don't give out other people's numbers, you'll have to ask him yourself" since its not very nice to give out numbers in the first place, and she wouldn't have assumed you were calling her a slut, and you wouldn't have to give her the number. win win.|`|ycC7S6JGaa	yeah|`|AA11289793	Yeah you did, she needed someone to put her straight and be there for her, to lean on and you helped her out, And also looked out for her friend, although I know how you feel sometimes doing the right thing hurts...|`|xUxUwloPaa	Just say sorry about the other night and be friends again. It doesn't sound like something that you two can't resolve.|`|5LWq12epaa	yes, you should be above the influence and tell her not to do that|`|ovKm8URRaa	wel. u could of been a little nicer.. but i dont blame you|`|pUr5F3vAaa	You both did and didn't. I understand why you didn't give her the number of the other person, which was smart of you because you were helping her and your friend by doing that. Even though she got pissed off and became rude, maybe that wasn't such a good idea that you were rude back. In other cases it would have totally been reasonable, but she said she's cutting and this is a time where she probably needs the most support and as many people caring for her as possible so she can get through this obstacle. If she said she's sorry, you should text her back and just ask to forget about it. She really needs the support right now.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Mq9GSSHhaa	I think you did the right thing in not giving her the number of your friend. It most likely would have caused issues in the life of the friend. But I think you should try and make it up with her over the text fight. I think she needs a normal person like you because she is obviously has a lot of problems. What with the cutting and such.  Good luck, sweetie!|`|DDJA6MqQaa	In my opinion, yes I think you did. Sounds like this girl doesn't really understand you and takes things the wrong way. You can find other people out there that probably will be even better friends than her. Good luck hun :)|`|771a46b3a001f059eb7ca678c7061fbdaa	I think the right thing would be to break up.  Sounds like you guys aren't quite right for each other.|`|X4X7bv97aa	Absolutely if you have a friend that feels like you dont care enough then they dont deserve you and you should forget them|`|iT2zgXdYaa	little harsh but i would have done the same thing.<br>  answer<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmOKeoJ9Xe4HQ.BLN.ytnijsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223164636AAjsXnU">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|0Bi6MufTaa	nope|`|bYvGNvrvaa	Honestly it seems like she's just looking for attention. Which seems to be the reason behind her cutting. She jumps from your cousin to you and now to wanting one of your other friends number. It looks like if she doesn't get satisfaction from one guy she'll go to the next. She's your basic attention whore. And no you were not harsh or to mean, you did the right thing, personally i think you should continue to ignore her.|`|Bhg28AJcaa	Absolutely, you couldn't of done anything else, you just gave advice... in fact i would with yelling at her, because saying it nicely, or just saying it didn't work, so you had to get it in her head... good job man, that was the best you could of possibly done|`|oBgirjGMaa	You did the right thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bitches need a strong hand to keep their asses in line.<br>  <br>  You, my friend, were her strong hand.|`|fbA7FCtJaa	Don't give up on telling her that cutting isn't good at all. yes it is bullshit but you should also tell the girl's boyfriend (your friend) that she's texting this stuff.|`|dEZOhDQLaa	I are damn right, i swear to GOD, that's was almost exactly what happen to me. (Her and i got back together a couples of time, then we broke up again.)|`|55kDtT7Taa	since she apologized, i dont think you should be so serious.try to be cool with her again.|`|ddMlbXdAaa	Yeah man you cant take **** off people.|`|1PsHM1fqaa	yeah unless you cut her|`|LX6VK0dvaa	yes u did... i would have done the same! but maybe a little bit nicer
bjnGSm4kaa	There this  guy that I have a crush on 2.  We both work in the same place. His so  fine 2 me!! but wen his looking my way  I totally avoid looking at him.  and is just cause am really shy around him and I don't want him to notice that I am so into him! am  not shy at all. but wen it comes to a gorgeous guy.... I guess I am!|`|GsRpZJX5aa	well i dont think im that shy now<br>  but before i was dating my bf of two years<br>  i definately did that. i would look at him from afar <br>  but once i knew he was looking at me i would pretend<br>  he wasnt there. its just the way us shy girls are. we will never <br>  make the first move!! and usually shy girls play hard to get (i did at<br>  least)       dude go for her!!!! it sounds like she likes you<br>  GOOD LUCK       :D|`|0Bi6MufTaa	love is a hoax, so forget everything you have ever heard|`|gKQDNpS3aa	yep. that's pretty much the definition of shy! it sounds like she wants you to approach her. so do it!|`|eus7WqzUaa	Yep! Go talk to her dude!|`|16HqzRcfaa	yes, they dont want you to catch them|`|w7XNcmihaa	I either look away from a guy if he looks at me and I like him, or I make eye contact. Or the guy is really ugly and I can't stand looks at him. :P|`|ZOKS33uzaa	I'm not really all that shy but i used to be now... i'm not. but any ways yes i would look at this guy during class and he would look at me and i would look away real fast before he could notice me looking at him and yall are in college so yall should be able to talk to her whenever you see her i man .... just go up  to her and be like hey whats up? <br>  Good luck <br>  ps i think she might like youu!:] <br>  let me know how that goes|`|uLFOdRdUaa	A lot of times it depends on the girl, but I would say that I have been known to act like that around a guy that I like.  The girl might be nervous to talk to you, not knowing the right thing to say so she looks down.  It does not mean that she likes you or that she doesn't.  For me, when I do that I am wishing that the guy would come over and talk to me, but like I said I am only speaking for myself.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|RAIcBSSGaa	Yes.I used to be pretty shy like that and that's how shy girls act. Maybe snag a machine next to her in the gym and talk to her real casually at first. See where it goes. But you should approach her b/c she prob won't b/c she is so shy. Good Luck!|`|RKV4sDj9aa	Yes! at least I do and why I do it is cause If you do not like me and I am checking you out you might think I am weird or something. I always think that I might make you feel uneasy.|`|xEZqZgaYaa	i would say so! Im not shy so i stare straight back. if she is shy then she does not want the attention as she is not comfortable therefore she isnt looking back.|`|soEfsKnuaa	yeh i probally would like him or she hits ur guts and dont want to look at u for a long time OR <br>  ....well i wont say it but tell me when u guys r starting going serious k?|`|icm5gtYnaa	yes, that is what i would do, or used to do when i was shy.<br>  good luck! =D|`|SMFzQsRXaa	she is shy. half smile at her next time you  have eye contact. her walls will come down a bit. say hi.|`|G0SvGeOWaa	it depends if you're hot or not at this point<br>  <br>  duh<br>  <br>  if you've never talked to her that's all you have to base it on.  unless she knows stuff about you.  but that has to do with your popularity rank.<br>  <br>  anywho.... dont get cocky and think you're mega hot, if you are, but if you're normal i think you can determine your hotness physically.<br>  <br>  she could just be looking at you b/c you're looking at her.  ever thought of that? haha but it just all depends. if you are not very attractive, then that is the reason.|`|rAAHHYEWaa	no i would look harder lol just go up to her and be like whats up|`|At3epWQwaa	This sounds like the situation I'm in, except I'm the girl. Well when I catch him looking at me, I look back, we make eye contact for a few seconds then look away. We both get shy sometimes and look away, but either one of us also look at each other when the other one's not. Just talk to her, I wish my guy would!|`|QczEdd5qaa	yeah<br>  <br>  <br>  i remember i was alone with this gorgeous guy!<br>  God! i wanted to say so many things to him....<br>  <br>  i made small talk and i could barely talk to him....<br>  <br>  He asked me questions and i answered? and it's funny 'cause i was trying to talk to him but i don't know i got shy.....<br>  <br>  also there was this hot clerk....<br>  <br>  i didn't want to buy my items with him 'cause i got to nervous|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	I used to be shy and would avoid looking directly at anyone especially someone that I liked|`|Dc2FkkuRaa	yep
twVyisGnaa	He's the one that's wrong.  He should've asked your permission to borrow your cell phone.  If he can't respect your property, then maybe he's not good for a relationship.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|7yUoLRDyaa	I mean no of course not, he took something from you. By him giving it back is leading me to think he was joking. But if you do answer the phone let him know that you didnt like the stunt that you pulled today and it wasnt cool because that is not something you play around with. And if his explaination is valid then forgive him and keep talking to him but if his explaination sound like B*ll *Ish...then drop him, its other guys out there that doesnt find something like that funny|`|NJrkgBaWaa	Im taking it this guy you like is IMMATURE... You just have't relized it, and if he is immature he probably can't hold a stable relationship..
YbO7D6axaa	I agree with the other guy, too much to read. But I'll help. From what you told us, she seems shy. Like only pointing at you when your back is turned and running when you see her doing it; that's shyness. If you like her I'd say keep going after her. Talk to her more and talk about deeper things, not things like "how was your day?"... And if you ask her once more to have her number and she turns you down, I'd say forget it because that might mean she's just playing little mind games, trying to see how long you'll keep pawing for her. Hope I helped. :)|`|P8vt2aLhaa	Start out as her friend and respect her parents rules. Then if she and you get closer then go from there.|`|39SPqvhyaa	just be her friend and see where it leads. she'll let you know if she wants more of a relationship or not.maybe she was just thinking in her friends best interest when she said; my friend thinks you're cute.|`|XiwHlQGIaa	she might be playing hard to get. but most of the time if a girl says that one of her friends thinks you're hot, it's cause she's not interested. sorry.|`|UEA4Uli9aa	Buy her a flower and give it tonher randomly <br>  Then when she asks what's this for<br>  Say<br>  "it's beauty made me think of you"|`|tDnD7Uqgaa	Babe you need to lighten up on wordy questions. Just be brief of what you ask. Now for the answer to your question me being a woman she sounds like she has conflicting feelings and moods. She may be the kind of girl that wants only to be friends or only wants to talk to you when she's not getting any other kind of attention from other guys. The way to test her is to go out with another girl (someone close to her) and see if she gets jealous. You don't have to like the (test) girl, but use her to see if the girl you want really wants or likes you. Just try it to see if it works if so she'll come to you.|`|uLHtXibRaa	I think she does but is just tryna play you off against this rodney guy  she is fishing for attention and seeing which one of you will fall at her feet first..|`|yEHdJwVGaa	dude, congrats, i think she likes u! <br>  <br>  can u help me with mine? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AksYw8JVHvT_rP0PhBGhRSjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090223133251AAQ30QP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|7s1oaRVaaa	talk to her more FLIRT. make her fall for you|`|0Bi6MufTaa	this is way too much to read, thats why|`|hXpKechTaa	too long bud =(|`|jw6OjQkEaa	u nid to show ur special u to her|`|W4W4v7haaa	okay im going to give you a real answer unlike all this stupid immature people who seriously need to grow the **** up haha<br>  so anyway<br>  if she really doing all that. then she deff likes you.<br>  she just playing hard to get..to see if you really do like her or not.<br>  i suggest you ask her if you can hang one time..go out to lunch or something. and start hanging at school alot more.<br>  and soon enough she will see that you really do like her. and will go for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  but yeah she DEFFIANTLY likes you dudee<br>  so dont give up on her.<br>  just be patient<br>  <br>  email me if you have any more question.|`|hdc3d3w8aa	Looong post.  <br>  <br>  She likes you.

Then you'll know for sure if she like you|`|FprmgS5laa	The only one who knows the answer is her. From what you've written i would say that she probably doesnt like you/ wont go after you. If she talked about a friend liking you and she was trying to set you up, well thats never a good sign.|`|2kbXrxFdaa	I would say she is interested but she wants her friends approval would ask her straight out if she is interested.

Ask if maybe one day she could stay after school and you stay after and just talk...well let her talk you listen girls like that....Good luck|`|ik9hP6FBaa	i honestly believe that this girl likes you, but i mean you just got to wait and see. if she talks to you a lot and she is kinda flirty that means she is interested, if she just talks to you it probably means she just wants to be friends, but i think that you should confront her. It seems like you really really like her and if you want to be with her you gotta talk to her. tell her how you feel and see if she feels the same way back. girls like guys that confront their feelings. on a scale of one to 10 i think she is an 7 into you.|`|yaDpb2SUaa	Tricky situation. I don't think you should go for it..she'd get a vibe that you were going through with this all too quickly. Give it some time, go step by step. Don't just jump into the situation, even asking her to hang out with you and your pals would be nice as well. Or going to the movies with a group of your friends, and her.<br>  <br>  If she's giving all of the good signs of flirting, that's good, but according to what you said...you didn't seem so certain.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
1OxiOk2taa	She is prob. just staying on the safe side. It depends where you have met. Don't worry so much- just keep with your letters or emails and you can still have an awesome friendship!|`|xyQRD8ahaa	if she thinks that you are more impressive, she would have thought to talk to you long back - sorry! i have no intention to hurt you.<br>  <br>  you've thought of speaking to her.-did you ever think of what might keep her from not talking to you? well, its not late... come up with solutions and write about it to her, and tell her that you would like to know how she sounds!!|`|dWgMBr1haa	Well thats depends, but did you ask her for her number ? She proabaly wants to keep a distance incase its not safe or something she might never knoW!|`|ihEMQKIdaa	try casually asking for their phone number. The worst thing they can say is no.
19e492c1ba8735dd07c030f14da3ecd2aa	well to be honest theres really no real "secert" to keeping it strong other than lots i mean lots of communcation and trust <br>  i was in one and its not easy but if u really want it to work then itll work but we do alot of talking on the phone,and emails and talks on here if theres anything else youd like to ask me feel free to email or im anytime <br>  it also depends on where u and this person live if for some reason why u cant be togeather and cant talk but i can say this has helped us out is we both prayed and still pray everyday that god wil find a way for us to keep us strong <br>  good luck to u|`|VIpN1G0Xaa	I like all of the sympathetic answers so far, but honestly, I think phone sex is great for long distance relationships.|`|sZB031Rjaa	Its hard to keep long distance relationships strong cause you cant spend alot of time with that person like you would like to.  I would say make sure theres communication and make time to come see each other.  My long distance relationship was bad and I dont think I would do it again, but best of luck to you.|`|rg7NTrzBaa	communication and the love in each others' hearts ...Good Luck ;)|`|NlEZNa7baa	You have to be able to have hours-long conversations with each other about everything and nothing, and you have to visit a lot. It does get sort of hard 'cause your lives become very separate, but just letting each other know that you miss them/think of them is enough to lose that sort of jealousy of the things/people in the other's day to day life. And most importantly, you have to both have enough going on in your own life (not so much that it's too easy to find a replacement) that neither one of you spends a lot of time pining away. Inevitably this will wind up turning into resentment that the other one isn't.
AA10189676	I would say just to give it some time and he will come around.  Just try to act and talk to him like you normally would when you see him.<br>  <br>  Just imagine if you were him and had been trying to act flirtatious around a friend to maybe take the relationship to the next level and they called you out on everything you have done.  And then on top of that they tell you they didn't like you that way or you make them feel wierd.  <br>  <br>  You might have given him a little wake up call on how he has been acting, but his ego has probably been bruised and he might even be embarrassed a bit.   If you want to keep him as a friend...be friendly!<br>  <br>  If you guys do start talking again and he starts acting the same old way, just brush it off.   When it comes to someone else's feeling tread lightly, you never know when you are going to need them in the future to lean on!<br>  <br>  Good luck!
dbe725df593f5e17b67ac77e5efbbfd8aa	Sounds to me like she really doesn't know what she wants.  Which is really not all that abnormal with us girls.  ;)  But if you've been pressuring her for an answer, or bringing the subject up too frequently, she may indeed be feeling like she's being pushed into something she really isn't sure of.  In my opinion, pushing her for an answer/decision may end up pushing her right out of your life.  I would say, back off a little.  Keep things easy, no pressure as usual.  Not sure what your very passionate kiss was based on...did you both have a little too much to drink?...or was it a totally sober, exchange of feelings kiss?  Regardless, it doesn't sound like the thought of you and her together is totally repulsive to her...haha....so I would just keep things low-key, for now.  As far as her jealous behaviour whenever another girl is mentioned....women tend to be very territorial at times.  Especially if she is still pondering the thought of hooking up with you on a more romantic basis.  While you don't have to avoid bringing up other girls you might be dating, I wouldn't flaunt it in her face.  It might end up looking like you're trying to make her jealous, which will go back to her thinking you are pressuring her for a decision.  Like I said, keep things as normal as possible.  And at some point, you may want to try that passionate kissing again.  Don't plan it in advance with her, just do it!  Sometimes, you just gotta pounce!!

uJgLjEvwaa	I hear you! I think that you've made a great step; wanting to be stronger. As much as it sucks at times to be a girl, we also have a lot of power to demand respect from guys . A guy will respect you in as much as you respect yourself and demand respect from them. Don't be afraid to put the guy in his place, "hey don't touch me" etc. If they give you a hard time about it or continue to walk all over you, then they are honestly not worth your time. Believe it or not, there are guys out there that will respect you, so shoot for the stars! You deserve the best!|`|epnymTJKaa	You have to make up your mind that you will not be taken advantage of, in any situation.  And stand by that.  If they do not like it let them go.  Chances are though, when they see that you are not going to take their ****, they like you more.  Men like strong women.  It is not a challenge for them to be with someone that will always do what they say.  Do yourself a favor and stop thinking about what they think so much.  Do what you enjoy and worry about what you think and what is best for you.  Confidence is apparent and is very attractive to guys.  Go to school gurl and be happy and that will make you strong.|`|YFuWIjBSaa	You can't change who you are.  The more confident you are about yourself and your life, the better you'll be able to handle the situations.  That probably won't come until you're a little older and more self-assured.  In the meantime, try not to open up too quickly with guys - they like a challenge and a bit of mystery.  But above all, don't beat yourself up about a guy who rejects you because it's just not personal.  Guys play the field, sow their oats and do that to loads of girls.  They can because they aren't emotional creatures like girls so their hearts don't get involved until much later on.  At your age, lots of guys don't want to be with just one girl - some do, others want to explore.<br>  p.s. the right guy will treat you right and like you as much as you like him.  It's hard to find but it only takes One.|`|v6cUS9OUaa	Gurl, you can't let guys walk all over you like that.  A strong woman cares what other people think but not to the extent that you do.  I'm considered a strong woman i guess. because i really don't care what people think. I go about mu business doing my thang.  To me it let doesn't matter what people think of me.  You just gotta put your foot down and say "I'm not going to men or anyone else walk all over me like ima welcome ma at the front door" and do it.  At first people will think that you are mean or whatever. just don't pay attention to them and do what you gotta do to get things done in life.|`|hdc3d3w8aa	Stop dating men until you feel better about yourself.

Do what you have to so that you dont need a man. You have to take care of yourself and buy your own things and make a MAN a "Maybe Priority" meaning "hey if i got a man i do but if i dont O WELL". Dont let a man walk over you, You do do and If it  means turning the tables thats what you do. You stand up and put yourself first and then them last!|`|Dc2FkkuRaa	If you're really looking for a guy.. pray and talk to God about it...do this everyday but focus on your studies and, although maybe not immediately, you will find the man your looking for. Be patient. Here are some verses from my Bible that would be helpful:<br>  <br>  Luke 10:19  Behold! I have given you authority and power to trample upon serpents and scorpions, and [physical and mental strength and ability] over all the power that the enemy possesses; and nothing shall in any way harm you.<br>  <br>  <br>  1 Peter 5:7  Casting the whole of your care[all your anxieties, all your worries, all your concerns,once and for all]on Him, for He cares for you affectionately and cares about you watchfully.<br>  <br>  <br>  II Timothy 1:7  For God did not give us a spirit of timidity (of cowardice, of craven and cringing and fawning fear), but [He has given us a spirit] of power and of love and of calm and well balanced mind and discipline and self-control.<br>  <br>  <br>  Psalm 27:14  Wait and hope for and expect the Lord; be brave and of good courage and let your heart be stout and enduring. Yes, wait for and hope for and expect the Lord.<br>  <br>  I hope these are helpful and I encourage you to read your Bible daily. Oh by the way these verses are from an amplified version so it sounds a little funny and has brackets and parentheses.|`|TBZK5q78aa	Whether you believe it or not, but it starts with faith in God. Second, stop falling for the same mistakes and learn from them. If you keep falling for the same flaws you will never evolve. Pray that you will gain wisdom in life. And stop letting men walk over you. Learn how to say NO in a tactful manner. And who knows why this guy isn't calling. People are different. In essence just ask him to talk about the problem and if it seems like he is playing games, leave him.

It is basically only because they have beenon this eath longer than I have and I believe that they how acquired more knowlege over than I have and that they know more than I do. So in my eyes since they know so much they have to pretty old. But now that I am getting older I realize that they aren't really that old and they don't really now that much, so once you start to mature and figure life out for yourself, they get "younger". lol.

Most of the time as they say it happens when your not looking.  Chin up, you've done well for yourself and there's no rush though it just takes time.  Though you have to be available and open to find a special someone( i wrote onesome and edited it:)funny though.  Best is to start as friends.

If she wants to break up again it might be for good. Dialogue is important.|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	No such thing as rules.  You'll have to play this one by ear.  If you expect her to 'earn your trust' again you're mistaken:  you have to forgive entirely to have her back, or it'll all go down the gurgler.<br>  <br>  I think though, to be fair: if you find out why she left you, and why she dated this other guy - by which I mean truly understand it - then trust issues will be resolved and your answer will be totally clear.  What to do will be very clear to you.  You need to know if she would ever do this again:  so you need to know, truly truly know, why she did it this time.|`|7XG5fd5Xaa	If you love her, then its worth another try.

I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.

But if she doesn't thats not reallyup to you. You cant cahnge who someone is but you can help them get out of that phase if it is one. Or maybe just help her relize what ger life would be like it with out you and all the people who care the most about her, because she is acting out and doing all that bad stuff. But most def stay her friend.|`|CdU35XPiaa	well if your bestfriends maybe ask her to come to your house, or go to her house so it's just the two of you and tell how you actually feel about what shes doing. tell her that since shes your bestfriend you dont want to see her hurting her self the way she is. she may not find a problem with what shes doing now, and she may get mad that your telling her what shes doign is wrong but she'll thank you for helping her now. and if she doesnt stop with drugs you should tell someone like a parent about it, if your bestfriends you owe it to her to do everything you can to help her.|`|BaXSNq3aaa	this is the time, where help is being brought into this situation. if no one is doing anything to help her with her actions who will ? shes yuor bestfriend you gotta help her out. if she keeps living like this and continuing her actions where will she end up what could happen to her? a lot of different bad things could happen to her. im sure you wuoldnt want her to go through those things. try to seek for help, before its too late!|`|I3wecKv8aa	is she acting like your friend? maybe its time you stop. and 14?! that's sort of like, young for drugs and sex....i'd say follow your instincts.|`|b80Zhg6Uaa	Friends just go in different directions sometimes... She's no longer the type of person you would want to be friends with...So  cut her off for now|`|ITmuThgXaa	NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOOOO!!! my sister had the same problem and her friend almost drove her mad i mean she made her think about killing herself!!!

Tell him how you feel and for all you know he feels the same.<br>  He IS really flirty i'll tell you that much but maybe he's just testing you out to make sure he has a chance with you and not get hurt. Ever thought of that? Flirt more with him and see what happens (:|`|FHb3En5naa	I think that really depends on how you feel about it. If you think that you wouldn't want to date him because you think he may be using you, then tell him or one of his friends that you just want to be friends. On the other hand, If you would want to go out with him, then I would just talk to him about it.<br>  For now, I would give him a chance. It sounds to me like he is a pretty nice dude.|`|mYQiWMFRaa	date him!!
0KLu4hRaaa	Someone fed you a lot of poo. A step parent is NOT financially responsible for your children in any way. Very rarely will a court order a step parent to help out in any way, and honestly why should they since they have no legal rights to the child. Brutal but honest. If you are that worried about it get a pre nup that states under no circumstances is she to pay for your children in any way. A lot of step parents do financially support their step kids but it is of their own choosing and NOT court ordered.|`|MLFBsZnUaa	From my understandings (and I have some experience with this), no, a step-parent is not at all financially responsible for a step-child. In some instances, the courts may take into consideration what the step-parent makes, but as far as I know, they cannot/will not take it from a step-parents check. Point in case...my husband has a 3 yr old daughter in which he has joint physical custody of her with the mother (they each have her equal times.) we tried to get the child support dropped, but because she makes like nothing, he still has to pay to have her the same amount of time (unfair if ya ask me). But, in order to try to help my husband out, cause he makes pretty decent money n she was only working 16 hrs a week for minimum wage...they tried to use her fiance's income in their calculations...but due to their calculation guide lines or whatever...it still would have been too off or something, so they just used hers. But, Had they used her fiance's as well...he still would not have been responsible for caring for my step daughter. Hope that made sense!|`|AA10065812	▼▲▼<br>  No.  Though some states take 20% of her income into account in setting child support, they cannot attach her income.  <br>  <br>  If you lose your job, you need to file a motion to modify your child support.  If you are current in you support, you can do this by making a request for a modification at the child support enforcement office.  If you are in arrears, and an enforcement action has been file, contact the Clerk of the Court and request forms for filing for a modification, Pro Se.<br>  <br>  You will need to get a copy of the child support guidelines and worksheet to determine if you have cause.  There needs to be at least a 20% difference in his payment.<br>  <br>  Never pay your child support directly to the mother as it can be considered a gift and not support.  Always pay threw the court.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  Take the time to learn what you can and should do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/DadsHouse/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...</a>|`|AA11538662	I am sure this will vary by state laws but I do know it has happened to someone I know here in Michigan. Step mommy's pay checks were garnished for her hubby's child support.<br>  <br>  Mary in Camden, MI|`|aLgY4l3Naa	Yes its true, once your married whats hers is yours and what yours is hers, so it don't matter who makes the money if child support is owed they may very well take it out of your fiances income, i would definitely get some legal advice as well just to be sure on all the little legalities there may be!! Good luck to you!|`|Ncad6d57aa	I never heard of that. But seriously man, why don't you just pay it. You had enough money to get your marriage license but don't have enough money for your own blood?|`|tSMRYe8waa	I don't know about that but if they file joint taxes there is a possibility that the refund check could go towards owed child support|`|jBigEy0Caa	Wow, I have never heard that before.  I will have to check into that around here.|`|5IO1JEY1aa	Its true!|`|4fC6EJWfaa	they could but they probably won't|`|ByUS0k8waa	Yes its very true. They can take her whole check for as long as it takes to pay the amount due.
64X5RxRbaa	I think its better to avoid people you like if they are 'unavailable' because it might stir up feelings between the both of you, and that would be unfair on her Fiance.|`|ByUS0k8waa	She probably likes to have someone to flirt with. Since she probably no longer gets that from the soon to be hubby. I would tell her the truth. Tell her that you just need some times to get over her.|`|3iNobwVraa	I don't know, maybe that's why.  Or, maybe she just liked you, as a friend, and enjoyed your company.  It doesn't really matter why, though, does it?  Neither answer changes the situation from your perspective.  <br>  <br>  So tell her you are out looking for a fun, single gal to ride the pony express.  You need to do what you need to do, so do it, and don't worry about it.  She can always get harmless flattery from the myriad of dumb, married guys who are already shackled to the ball and chain! :)|`|tL73W0VZaa	She may like you as a friend, or having you crushing on her may boost her ego. Either way, she's not available, so until you are certain that you're over her, it's definitely a good idea to keep your distance. If your friends are right, and she just likes you around to fawn over her, then it's going to look pretty pathetic if you keep "seeing her around". If she just wants to be friends, that won't make it any easier for you. Just tell her you've been busy, and then change the subject. If she keeps pressing the subject, you can ask her if she's been busy, after all, isn't she engaged? Doesn't she want to spend time with her boyfriend? <br>  <br>  It's a tough situation to be in. . .|`|NctuEmFKaa	Women like attention.  She may truley like you as a friend, but if you have feelings for her and you are trying to move on since she is engaged, then talk to her and explain this to her.  <br>  <br>  Tell her that you are respecting her relationship, and think she should spend more time with fiance.  stop giving her so much attention.  You can be around her with friends, but make it clear you respect she isn't available.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
AH4TVEBIaa	yes she is being dramatic but still make her feel better so she wont do anything stupid|`|2keIEMFUaa	Yes! Because her dad is just looking out for her best interest.  Tell her you think she needs to seek some kind of counseling if it's that bad.  Plus! She should have a talk with her dad about being over protective|`|ZmwKkWvWaa	Yes i do,And call 911,<br>  Its for her safety|`|uzkV9oVMaa	What?<br>  <br>  Im confised but yes she being a drama queen|`|Vb8yWZyLaa	no... she isn't... my dad is the same.. no joke...he does all of that (if you can believe it) and more... i have thought of suicide and came really close to it once.. but my friend talked me out of it... and this was when i was like 13 so about two years ago this happened...so just talk to your friend and comfort her and tell her that everything is going to be okay... and if you can talk to her bf... and tell him to try and comfort her too.... and tell her how much it would hurt you if she killed herself... just talk to her... trust me it worked for me.... it should work for her|`|pXkWoqKjaa	she is being a little over-dramatic but just be there t support her...<br>  let her know you care...<br>  and don't let her forget it...|`|AA11388175	talk to her about it...|`|Tn0EBBCZaa	First off dont call 911 thats just bad advise. She is just being a drama queen and you can give her advise to talk to her dad. He is just concerned for her safety, and i personally think it is very sweet. Get her to talk to her dad, he will understand and if she thinks that running away will be the answer she is soo wrong she will be under a lock and key

Be careful with a Gemini, they are always on the move and lookout for new places and people! lol have fun though, if there is really a strong connection there, horoscopes shouldn't matter that much! I am a sag women and i've been dating my Gemini man for awhile now, and we are working out great! :-)<br>  Good luck|`|AA10197672	Sure why not? What does the sign have anything to do with this? If you both love eachother, have things in common and wanna spend the rest of you life with eachother, by all means go and get married!!! I know couples that by horescope were not a good match, however they get a long great and are very much happily married. So put all that stuff aside and look deep whithin the two of you and see if you got what it takes to be happily married...|`|iJRcdSbiaa	i'm a sag woman dating a gemini man for a few yrs now.  it's been quite something and he's still here.  they're drawn to us and visa versa.  enjoy...|`|AjjKETIxaa	Be practical.

See what happens...if he doensn't come to his senses, then he's not worth it.  Move on to someone who appreciates you for you.
sPu8XuCQaa	Don't wait on that final day to come.  Let him know how you feel now so that when the day come, if he still chooses to go with you, it will be more special.

What does it matter that he wants to go as friends? He probably doesn't want to jump into anything to quickly.

Then tell him you asked him to go with you because you like him and ask him how he feels. If he tells you again that he just wants to be friends, act cool about it and let him know that if he changes his mind that you're there. And leave it at that. Don't freak out!|`|b78cdaa08f64e270556b5d06dd714156aa	Develop the friendship and see if it goes somewhere. If he sees another guy invading the territory he thinks he should have, he will step up. :) Have fun at the dance!|`|bdCwpU2Jaa	Becoming friends is the first step in a relationship.... Have fun and be yourself and who knows, he could ask you out!|`|884a5bc32fca6d468f9e8afb165f0050aa	You say you found out he only wants to go as friends.  How did you find out?  Unless you heard the words directly come out of his mouth, don't believe it.  Go to the dance, but remember this, at this point in your relationship you really are "just friends".  You're not an item because you've never dated on a continual basis.  You're not lovers because you don't have sex with each other.  You are two friends going out on their first date together to see if you like each other enough to go out again.  Nothing more.  So don't stress.|`|f866d5b354a267b2f67d129da678201daa	dunno|`|7af5ff3a092a9d8e6e10e9346d74d6ceaa	Just go and have a good time, but this means you gotta flirt with others and find other guy's while your there and don't get mad when he dances with other girls your now only friends, unless he turns up the heat on you then you stay close by his side. Or if you know a guy that likes you and you like him go with him, tell the other guy early so he has time to find another date.|`|9b9fa575e1d2b4849a43025ff051bba8aa	Go anyway. How do you know he only likes you as a friend and nothing more? Did he tell you that? Even if he did, it is a good sign that he even said yes. People change their minds. If you two go out he may realize how great you are and begin to like you as more than a friend. Besides, you only want to get to know the guy if he wants  to be more than your friend? That's not cool. Go the dance anyway, see how it goes and if it goes well tell him how you really feel about him.  You may go out with him and decide that you really don't like him. The main point is....GO!|`|AA12225497	Why the heck would you want to like him so fast....you need to wait...stop being so desperate!|`|wcK1gHvIaa	If you really like him and you fear he only likes u as a friend then ask him how he feels.  If he doesn't like you the way you like him, then don't go to the dance with him, it'll just make you feel bad.  Trust me, I know from personal experience.
d00ad728f442a5ce11c0ff2c4a8c379daa	I heard recently that what you find attractive in others is the similarity to yourself, appearance wise.  You see yourself all the time and take comfort in what you see.  When you come across someone who is somewhat like you, you are drawn to that person as it is familiar.  This helps explains the notion that when we get older we tend to look like our partners.|`|1Q15uZbvaa	Its not a fact that when one people look at you and decided your ugly then everybody will think your ugly. As the old saying goes beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I may look ugly at your sight but on his sight I'm the most beautifully girl ever, well of course that's my opinion...|`|2677698458c11c3fd2b9dcdb78409fa7aa	i think its a mental phenomina|`|72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	Everyone sees who they want to see.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Some people like blonde hair and blue eyes, some prefer dark hair and brown eyes, some prefer someone who looks more like them, or their race, or who is exotic and different.  Depends on a lot of factors we call chemistry.  The science of chemistry is such, some people are attracted by physical characteristics and others, by the mind, or cultural, religious and so on.  Alot of what makes someone attractive, can be subtle, like that the person is kind and gentle, or a strong and rough.  All of us have that "vision" of what we think is sexy, is handsome, or beautiful.  Some of us appreciate deeper things than pure physical beauty or lack thereof, the beauty of the mind, the soul can overcome the physical for some.  Who hasn't had the ugly friend, who became beautiful to us when the chips were down and they were at our side through some difficulty?  Did how cute they are really make us feel better, or was it their character, their devoted loyalty to us, even when we were down?  A guy once explained his facination to me of redheads with freckles.  He had a crush on a little redhead when he was a kid, he thought she was facinating, interesting and exotic.  He couldn't keep his eyes off of her.  She totally enthralled him.  As he got older, he gravitated towards the girls with redhair, freckles and pale skin.  He dated others, but love the redheads best.  Found them lively, engaging and never boring.  Now, being a redhead, I was flattered by all his attention.  I was the girl he had been facinated with since childhood.  He made a point of sending me letters from far off locations as he traveled the world, he never missed a birthday, a Valentines and so on.  As years went by, we would meet and talk, and we always had very lively conversation, he was a much read, well traveled and smart man.  But out timing was off, and we never managed to cross that bridge into marriage with one another.  He now is married for the second time, and seems very content.  We are still lovely friends, but not like the days gone by.  His reality was marrying completely different girls.  Why?  Don't know.  But we all have ideas of who we would like to have, who we end up with may be entirely different.  But sometimes, it sticks in a way, that no matter what, thats what we go for.  We all have the friend that whines and complains about how bossy and annoying and demanding his girl is, but then, all his girls have been that way.  One day, he ups and marries the Queen of Mean and he still whines.  Or he marries the one girl that wasn't.  We all have different imprints.  If we are smart, we look for more stable things than just pure physical beauty, as beauty fades, dumb is forever.  By the way, this was a great question!|`|ccde448ea6a54ed844e3693b57fd0a8daa	Exactly true on all points. Could be the first for some & could be the second for some.  :)|`|DjZOoRN8aa	I think it comes naturally from one person characters not from the appearance. :)|`|McEo9kVZaa	beauty is relative, one can be so cute for according to a person but ugly according to another. every person has his/her way of seeing. but one fact remains, everyone is attractive.

F0IegpyPaa	Depende siempre de la educación y del tiempo que le dedique el ni?o a  cada cosa.....aunque yo también a?adiría las consolas de videojuegos....<br>  En cualquier caso, según vaya cumpliendo a?os, le pasará lo que a la mayoría de la gente.Se verá influenciado de una manera u otra a algo de lo que ve en la televisión:noticias(que manipulan como quieren),publicidad(eres más feliz si utilizas más este o aquel producto),las series de televisión(si eres como aquel o aquella ligas más)los frikis(yo también quiero ser famoso)y como le guste cantar......<br>  Aunque está claro que quién va a estar siempre ahí para apagarte la televisión e intentarte quitar pájaros de la cabeza o apoyarte para que levanten el vuelo van a ser los padres.Besos.|`|ce33fd2f560e52480648078fd1ec8bd8aa	Definitivamente los padres.  Si bien la televisión llama poderosamente su atención, pero saben que es un espectáculo, los ni?os no son tontos.  Lo que HAGAN los padres es determinante, no lo que digan, mucho más alto hablan las actitudes, si las actitudes reforzan o repiten lo que ven en televisión entonces lo imitaran pensando que es lo adecuado.  Por todo esto es muy importante la madurez de los padres en la formación de sus hijos, cuando seriamente se hace el delicado trabajo de padres es cuando se puede decir que no importa la cantidad de tiempo que pasen juntos, sino la CALIDAD de ese tiempo o sea el mostrar con inteligencia y en forma práctica el sentido de una vida buena.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Los padres porque son quienes estan mas cerca de ellos, si eres un buen padre tus hijos te respetan.|`|90Ttf8Edaa	Buena pregunta, pues creo que la televisión es un medio de comunicación muy poderoso y persuasivo y que si es utilizado de forma correcta puede ayudar mucho en la educación, pero se supone que los padres son las personas que necesitan aprender a educar a sus hijos y en ellos recae la responsabilidad de que sus hijos no se vean influenciados por la tv y su contenido.

No creo que eso sea correcto. Creo que una mujer que establece una relación de pareja debiera de ser lo suficiente segura de si misma para saber que quiere hacer con su cuerpo. Cuidarlo o descuidarlo. Es importante que las mujeres comencemos a tomar las riendas de nuestra vida y no delegar en nuestra pareja esa responsabilidad. Si tu te gustas gordita, la seguridad de tu personalidad la trasmitirás a tu pareja y así te va a aceptar, si tu te gustas y te aceptas esbelta, cro que eso lo trasmitirrás también a tu pareja. Eso es lo que nos falta, seguridad!|`|3b84ff94f142a8eb4a0372419f3b9880aa	hombres y mujeres ,por mucho que nos cuidemos ,nuestro cuerpo cambia<br>  no es la misma estructura osea alos 20 que a los 40 o 60 <br>  hay personas que engordan por factores geneticos u hormonales,pero si amas a la persona que esta a tu lado ,no amas solo lo fisico,amas el todo de esa persona<br>  si vas a amar solo el envase te compras una mu?eca de plastico y sera toda la vida igual,igual de flaca e igual de hueca<br>  aunque hueco en realidad  es quien te ama solo por lo fisico<br>  v

UfMSWvyYaa	I think he's 'interested' There is a difference between 'interested' and 'likes' I think that's something young people haven't quite realized. But it sounds like he's interested and definately worth pursuing.|`|8d2dafa2e677fbcd1bf84bcf3389e331aa	i agree. he may be interested but not necessarily like you. talk to him some more then you'll know.
mYBqb0c9aa	people like this will soon reaslise what they are doing. i believ in what goes around comes around so if she deos bad then bad will come back to her. you need to be patient thought. but if you want to get your point across say it as a joke if someone calls her a **** then just play along with it but this can go two ways. she'll laugh with you and then think about what you said or she will not like it at all and ditch you. also its only school you'll have a couple more years until you leave and she'll be gone for good. just hold in their just a bit longer and before you know it it'll all be over.
3PCcQu2vaa	I think it's hard to be Lizzy's friend...and I don't think she's a very good friend, either.  Even if you only have a few friends in seventh grade, and even if your friend tells everyone to not be your friend, you should just make new friends.  It might not  be easy, but I think it'll be better than to hang out with that mean bully...!|`|14E75ktGaa	pass 7th grade.
GrG7y8ovaa	Yeah its a little weird... Sorry|`|UmxxBr6uaa	No, totally not weird. Tell your friend, though. She can probably give you better advice because she knows you, and I suppose she knows him too.|`|41ERtXVbaa	Nope i done that liking  a 4th   grader.and im a   6th grader. just dont tell your friend.|`|7NsVWqHAaa	No thats not weird.....its just normal.|`|9rSlhIxAaa	You could have a crush on anyone. Thats totally normal. Not weird at all. That once happened to me. Most of my friends knew I had a crush on him. He never found out. Well if shes your best friend. Yea, I think you should tell her. Good Luck!
19aa56b7a7a5b156e5fc60401be344c1aa	Just ask him silly|`|198b7302a0c51f9f785cafc90e2d8defaa	simple ask him <br>  <br>  if he says no just act kool and be like okay
fb8683efbe281f9bfd3307ebd4b99e3faa	flirt. it always works. sweet talk him.|`|39bbe39cde3a5927fd1327614f797c36aa	all I have to say is this much: DO NOT ask him out in the middle of a class|`|15b3aa9cd9a8e37f933950ac98d2a5b4aa	GO CRAZIER|`|492b727a1ef68dcf20c09134fff2224baa	get a friend 2 find out or just really, ask him urself.|`|AA10184202	give him your email/sn and talk to him there. flirt and see if he flirts back. if he doesn't, then just give it more time, if he does, keep at it. if things are starting to go good, go places with him as a group until you're ready to ask. good luck :]|`|c64c22c1d663bbc4946598d4859c0052aa	Well, I'm not really an expert in this department considering that I just got turned down by a guy who I was crazy about.  And yes, he pulled the "let's just be friends" line...the cheesiest of them all!  <br>  <br>  Well, anyway, if I were you I would wait a while and just flirt with him.  You don't want to end up regretting that you ever asked him out or told him that you like him.  Look for signs that he might like you such as waiting for you after class or just talking to you more than other girls in the class.  <br>  <br>  After you flirt with him more (but not to scare him away!) just casually bring up that you've been having some thoughts lately.  He will probably ask about what and be oblivious as many guys are and you can tell him that it's just boy troubles.  He may offer to help but just bring it up with confidence and hopefully you will get down to the basics that the one you like is him and you weren't sure how to say it.  He'll be thrilled that you were a little nervous like he may be too.  <br>  <br>  Sorry this is so long, but I've done the wrong thing so many times and I want it to be right for you.  Just give it time, and don't push anything.  And if he doesn't like you back, I'm sure it's his loss...guys can be stupid like that sometimes.  Hope everything works out!|`|f078d19e1a3bff6ef57753c0a5ae5083aa	If he knows u exist.. talks to you ((not just "hey or wassup")).. and flirts with you then he could be feelin you. Guys like that are kinda hard to read. But you'll really and truly know if he likes you when he goes out of his way to talk to you.. meets you @ your locker.. tells his friends he likes you.. or even calls you/ask for your numba. <br>  <br>  U shouldn't ask him out becuz that's usually the *guys* role but good luck!! Don't do it until u know "for sure" he's interested in you. Then you'll look dumb if he's not!!
AA12248245	Yeah, I'd say he's angry about something. Perhaps he's angry about the physical and hormonal changes wracking his mind and body, and now he feels "funny" about you, but doesn't know how to handle it. <br>  <br>  Too bad he said that. Better ways to handle it. Write your friend off until he grows up a bit.
b9d07f1bb79ee4d1d295acb16b300e73aa	One line: Follow your dreams!!!!|`|AA10799420	Sweetie, I'm a guy, and I'm going to be straight up with you here. The best way to get a guy to notice you is for him to see you with other guys. We men are a strange bunch. We think we have it all, and we LOVE it when a woman wants us. The more a woman wants us, the more we take her for granted. So, my advice to you is, ignore the hell out of him, and make it a point to be on a date with someone else and he can see it. I ga-RON-tee he will be calling you!!!|`|8HkFPGITaa	dump him and go for sumone els|`|1bba09d9c573ce7a2d37ec2e646045c0aa	just be ur self|`|RrhEzwfAaa	I think funny guys are the greatest. Laugh at his jokes, don't act desperate but flirt with him. Keep trying. Also, you're young so if it doesn't work out it isn't the end of the world. Don't ruin your friendship with him OR your other friend.|`|VmqvzLlgaa	now child i know you are going to dislike my answer but focus on your school work. yes i understand it's 2007 and times have changed but you don't need one at this time. you need to get a jhs degree as well as an high school diploma and then you should pursue your professional degree..boys/men are for when you're an altogether person and u love urself..
238f577f0e8571113854d17262be8596aa	Flirt with him talk to him alot but not too much to where he thinks your desperate make him want u! dont be slutty tho there is a minimum amount of flirting you need to do. Just compliment him from time to time like that shirt looks hot or good on you. or wow you passed the test man i suck you think you could help me out. then yall could get together after school and have like a study date..........depending on how old you are.
AA12317258	lol haha wow. are allboys like that? <br>  <br>  i think all boys like playing with fire. i tried to get mybf to stop but i just couldnt. lol let him have his fun.|`|1TyBgTSdaa	Maybe you should take him somewhere and make it fun.|`|46eae5bae111ea333560142bdf790edbaa	Fire obsession in adults is a sign of deep emotional trauma/turmoil usually from childhood abuse. Does he see it as a problem? Is he able to explain the obsession? Does he talk about abuse?<br>  <br>  Try to help him seek help from a professional...seriously. I have seen this behavior in a number of people and the results are never good.|`|A2apimyKaa	Uh...how old is your boyfriend? 7? Anyways, why don't you take him to a doctor?|`|J7mSnQPpaa	Call the fire dept in his area and dump him.|`|AA12353140	say "bobby, if you don't stop playing with fire I'm gonna break up with you"

00acf4d5ad20a1f52ce4c0b5f5ff3715aa	its so great to hear that u have decided to ask her! so many guys miss their chance, and you never know if u never ask. (maybe i should take my own advise..lol) i have allways had this theory, that the relationship wont work out if you are not friends before you are lovers. friends first. start asking her questions about herself. really get to know her. make her feel like she can tell you anything. if she is able to feel comfortable with this, there is slim chance of rejection. really get to know her, what her favorite colors are, waffles or pancakes, favorite movie, why? etc. it show you are intrested. Hope this helps. good luck!|`|5c3d9e5bd5c45675da91f716a802604eaa	approach her any way you like just as long as your being yourself! good luck!|`|8b929205fc32f14d44463b03de70a43daa	have a friend give a note to the girl ask her out on that note.|`|AA11176968	Don't be nervous.

If she's interested, she'll say so.  If she's says no, then still continue to speak to her as you have (maybe even a little more) and try again in a week of so.  Maybe she's just not comfortable with you enough and needs a little more time to get to know you.  <br>  Good luck!!|`|845bce83f5d302c94982a2715764a4e6aa	Crack a joke or do something funny.

A7nIADxgaa	Sometimes I don't think nothing about it, just a couple kissing like another<br>  <br>  Or, I could think they're a cute couple<br>  <br>  Or, I might find them lucky because I would like to have a boyfriend at that moment (could piss me off as well)<br>  <br>  I think that's pretty much it|`|6wTfRlhlaa	i find nothing wrong with that.<br>  me and my bf do it all the time.<br>  but the only thing that sucks with that is the fact that my school<br>  has a "no pda policy".<br>  but dont let him pressure him into doing anything that you dont wanna do. if you dont wanna kiss in public, then stand firm and tell him that you do not wanna kiss in public.

702b875560d5c6e4bb5a31f860b05696aa	I personally believe that gays should be able to marry. I don't believe that this should be a religious issue. Because whether or not you're religious person, under law it states that everyone should be treated equally, and gays are no exception. <br>  <br>  Just look at how hypocritical both the democratic party and the republican party are being. Obama is a black man. Before, blacks were treated as less than half a person. People treated them as slaves---as something sinflu, as if they're color was tainted with a "diabolic die." Women weren't treated any better. They were (and still are in some sense) treated as second class citizens. Being contricted and repressed by a male-dominated society, women were treated unequally as well. Palin, for example, has a daughter who is giving birth at the age of 17. That was considered to be inappropriate---a definite action that was against society's mores and set norms. <br>  <br>  However, America has made adjustments, and has improved. Black men (please note that Obama isn't entirely black) can run for president now, women can work, earn a living, and not buy into their own stereotype of being simply a housewife or sex symbol. Yet, despite all these changes, people still want to treat gays the sameway these other groups were treated in the past? Don't they deserve change? Don't they deserve to be treated equal as well? <br>  <br>  If you ask me, heterosexuals already abuse the principle of what "marriage" is suppose to be. So why not give homosexuals a shot at marraige? Maybe they will show that the majority of them won't divorce compared to the 70% of divorced couples who are heterosexual. <br>  <br>  And no, I'm not an atheist. I simply have an open mind. And if you a person who seriously just believes that your bible is law. Please consider the fact that the bible was still written by man---someone who is flawed in some way or form. And I have met many gay people who are still christians and catholics and even budists themselves. Just because they go against YOUR own religion, doesn't mean that they don't deserve the right to be treated equally. <br>  <br>  I have actually spoken to a lezbian woman who disapproves of gay sex marriage. And you know the reason why? She said that there has to be line drawn somewhere. And that she didn't want her kids, or anyone elses kids to learn about gay marraige, or to even be open with the idea at school. In my opinion, that's just ridiculous. For one, prop 8 has nothing to do with teaching kids about marriage in general. It doesn't fit anywhere into the school's curriculum. Kids need to learn math, science, english, health, etc. And even if they DID learn about it. People, most "good" school would give two sides to the argument because the majority of professors are open-minded people. They would talk about heterosexual couples and homosexual couples. <br>  <br>  Second, just because your kids learn about gay people, doesn't mean that they'll turn into one. Stop being scared of such things. Let your kids choose from themselves. And let them be who they are. <br>  <br>  Thirdly, why shouldn't people be or feel open about this subject? I'm tired of all the false faces and false identities people feel obligated to wear on a daily basis. Shouldn't you BE who YOU are? Shouldn't you feel FREE to talk about things you want to talk about? Shouldn't we all feel comfortable of who we are? <br>  <br>  In sum, in order to eliminate the prejudices of society, we need to take a step forward. If we approve of one bias or one prejudice, then we approve of all of them. We need to treat gays equally by allowing them the opportunity to wed. History has taught us that such prejudices aren't right. Let's put this history, this knowledge to good use by attempting to eliminate are current/ present bias---just like how we eliminated the inequalities (to a good extent) of minorities and between genders. <br>  <br>  One person said to me, "but no matter what there will always be discrimination and prejudices. Some people will always hate black people for example." That may be true, but if people continue to think with this same mentality, then it will be so. Like I said, we need to take a STEP FORWARD (improve our way of thinking) by changing and getting rid of our current prejudices. It's wrong to treat others differently. <br>  <br>  Just imagine how many gay people feel. I for one have never wanted to get married to anyone (and yes, i do have a boyfriend and i'm not gay). But I am trying to empathize with these people. I'm trying to walk a mile in their shoes. How would you feel if you grew up always wanting to marry the one you loved. You never knew if it was going to be a man or woman at such a young age. But you always envisioned a beautiful wedding. A real wedding and for some reason, you just had to have that legalized paper to make it official. But wonder if your ideal, American dream was ruined just because the person you called your significant other happened to be the same sex as you? I mean, who cares? Let them love|`|XAwRXtsWaa	Gay marriage is not bibical.  If anyone cares about their eternal destiny then they need to open up the bible and read what God has to say about it.

But in God's eyes it is NOT. |`|tvgfzr8waa	no on prop 8. who cares wat gays are doing on their own, unless ur some nosy redneck that enjoys butting into other peoples buisness then you should have the common decency to leave them alone. the only evidence about their marriage is a ring.|`|ztl5SRp5aa	I am for gay marriage.

If a person can find someone whom they love and trust, respect and admire, who wants to build a life with them, gender is the last thing they should have to worry about.<br>  <br>  When you are committed to someone you're committed.  |`|vj2pWs9Maa	I don't see anything wrong with it.<br>  Besides, what business is it of anyone elses who people fall in love with and marry?|`|c1wCuGzpaa	do i even have to say anything...............................e... you know it is not right or you wouldnt be on here asking for opinions.....you dont see me asking you if it's okay if i'm married to my husband.....goodness!|`|pub2GLZPaa	I don't think its right.<br>  <br>  Maybe call it something else (with the same rights attached to the term) but not marriage|`|aqj4E7Aeaa	They have just as much right to be miserable as the rest of us.|`|AA10121156	against it|`|a5cb58a8106c34d8f182eaa2e2377a36aa	Against it. Biblically, its wrong- but God is willing to forgive if there is repentance and if you turn away from what you know God says is wrong. Personally, I beleive marriage belongs between a man and a woman. and If you need physical evidence of that, a ,man and a woman are created to fit together perfectly- a woman and a woman or a man and a man are like two puzzle pieces you have to force together in order to make it work, its not natural. And no, this is not judgment if its already stated in the bible that its wrong- its just bringing up a point that has already been stated a long time ago. But to each is own- its their decision, and if they want to be gay and get married, that is their choice, but there are still a lot of people in this country who hold onto old moral values, and I will always be one of them. |`|dAJ5DORTaa	I don't see people asking what you feel about heterosexual marriage. We all know that's what "marriage" is. <br>  After the ceremony, you're pronounced Husband and Wife. <br>  I don't try to cram my lifestyle down anyone's throat, and I don't think they should demand we change, that what is "CORRECT" <br>  When it works on the Discovery Channel, we can talk! <br>  It's as simple as that!|`|7IPDyLoBaa	Its their life and their choice.<br>  <br>  If 2 people of the same sex love each other and want to get married then they should be able to plus their not hurting anybody by doing this.<br>  <br>  It doesn't affect anybody else's life so i dont know why others have a problem with it.|`|2072187ff7929478ed6771aad434e782aa	No one told me who I could fall in love with and/or marry...who am I to tell them.

CX1sBZLNaa	Being able to connect with your partner in a physical level isn't enough for a long lasting relationship, you need to able to connect on an intellectual level. This is actually far more important than the physical aspect, as looks certainly fade. <br>  <br>  So try to get him interested, if it doesn't work, then maybe you need to move on.|`|ULBcee9xaa	maybe u can, i mean u should know if u can u know him, but if doesn't get interested give me a call
9e9f4291392994e15641f40bd2525821aa	If I was your husband, I wouldn't tolerate such behavior from my x.  Your husband isn't putting you first.  He's following the path of least resistance.  He should not allow this from his x-wife.  Just because they have a son, doesn't mean that she is allowed to invade and corrupt your marriage, but it's up to him to put an end to it.  If he won't then yes, you may have made a mistake, where the only way to get him to get off dead center is to explain that this either ends now or you're gone.  If he won't budge, then you'll at least know that his vows were contingent upon other circumstances, where being a lesser priority isn't going to work for you.  Better to end it now than later, if that's what it comes to.|`|AA11017606	wow sounds really bad. have a baby and give them another grand kid to dote on. go over to your in-laws all the time and be sugary nice. never talk negatively about her and if you see her, smile and talk to her as if you have no clue she doesn't like you. it will make her nuts. she will not know what to do with herself. especially when you are nice to her.|`|38855e8cd12b306955e9a6f2705a4320aa	It's obvious that some boundaries need to be set here. Your husband needs to talk to his ex-wife to tell her that she needs to respect your new marriage.<br>  <br>  Your husband's family will draw their own conclusions. If invited to a family function, I would call ahead to see if the ex will also be there. If so, decline the invitation. Your marriage is the most important thing, next to the well being of the child. <br>  <br>  As far as your step-son is concerned, be as gracious to him as possible. I wouldn't bad mouth his mother for anything. This would only add fuel to the fire. <br>  Sooner or later, the ex (hopefully) will meet someone else and let go of your spouse.<br>  <br>  When all else fails, seek professional counseling.<br>  Good luck.|`|6ce98419978ab16c62d7adef37cb5adbaa	Welcome to my world!<br>  Just keep the peace, it's better for the kid!

You knew all of this before you got married.  Don't bi$#h about it after the fact.  Quit playing her stupid game.  Quit reacting to her.  Don't talk to her.  Quit caring about what she says to people.  You need to be concerned with the kid having access to the dad, and keep your mouth closed when it comes to his ex. Handle it like a man would.  It's always women who hate the ex wife.  You never hear of this scenerio with men.  And quit antagonizing your husband about it!  He's right , she never will change and you can't make her.|`|3b08a7e7a884634537a3927840401a3daa	In this one, you should just wait it out and be the bigger person. She's never going to like you but for the sake of the child, you need to try to be patient with her. She may tire of her games after a while, particularly if she finds a new man. I know it's unbearably irritating and she's a complete manipulative monster, but the most you can do is comment on how sad it is she's unable to get on with her life. Don't counter by saying bad things about her, but simply point out when she's wrong about what she says about you, and then repeat it's so sad that you figure so largely in this woman's mind. <br>  <br>  I heard from my grown adult daughter that my ex (whom I divorced five years ago and never see or speak to) does nothing but talk about me when she visits, and if she tries to change the subject, he finds a way to bring it back to me. She realizes it's really sad and pathetic, and I can only wonder how the woman he lives with now feels about it that he's a broken record about me after all these years. People will eventually tire of your husband's ex's whining and will recognize it for what it is. Just be sweet, kind, wonderful and they'll soon know what's going on.|`|AA11807496	Tuff spot to be in but you're not alone.  Unfortunately you will have to learn to live with the situation.   I think it's important not to bad mouth her, she obviously is able to gather the troops when necessary.  Your husband left her and chose you to spend his life with, think about that when she gets under your skin.  His family may be nice to her because of their grandchild and they certainly are not going to take up arms against their own son where she is concerned.  It may look like she's swaying them but blood really is thicker.  Eventually she will burn that bridge.  Kill her with kindness it's the best defense I've found and will make it obvious she's manipulating.  Six months????  You're still a newly wed, enjoy your husband !|`|AA12273500	Ex wifes should not be apart of the new relationship. Its not healthy or respectful to the new partner. She should not be involved in your life at all. The only relationship he should have is with his child as the child is only 5 the ex would have to have some input although as  the child gets older she should back off and allow your husband and yourself develop your own relationship without her input. You will never be able to have a proper bond as long as she is involved as she obviously dislikes you and will not encourage that bond. Try and spend as much time as you can concentrating on the child and building a relationship with her. As for your husband going over there all the time maybe he should go to pick up the child and take her/him to a park rather then visiting at the ex's house. The ex needs to let go and stop relying on your husband for emotional support.<br>  Good Luck|`|a2907cc7697c5bfdf4f6f7173027dc8aaa	Don't let it stress you out. Try to be the bigger person in the situation. Because there is a child involved, she will always be apart of your life from now on as long as you and your husband are married. i.e. graduations, birthdays, wedding etc|`|c6558149ffdff644da2a2daca4beb1d3aa	First, you did not marry her husband, you married her ex-husband :)<br>  <br>  Your in-laws should not allow her to speak about you or your husband.  The life you two share together is none of her business and they should make that clear to her.<br>  <br>  They may be afraid to stand up to her, fearing that she will not allow them to continue seeing their grandson or nephew.<br>  <br>  As bad as it makes you feel, she will be welcomed to their house.  There should be a limit, if it is not regarding the child then she should not be included.<br>  <br>  The sad part is, you are letting it get to you, DON'T.  She is the miserable one because she is still holding on to her past, she refuses to move on and she will always be unhappy.  Don't let her make you unhappy, just remember you have what she wants.|`|d581282874e0369f21cd661c9cb3578baa	When you married that man with a child you had to realize you were marrying into issues. For the child's sake, you need to get along with the ex. The child needs to see healthy relationships and it is your responsibility as a  new step mom to show that child those relationships. Pretend the child was your own biological child and make decisions from that standpoint. It seems to me that you should have been encouraging your now husband to work on his marriage when he was dating you!! She really shouldn't know any information about you and your husband unless he is telling her. She does have a right to express her personal opinions just as you have. They have a five year old and will be around for 12 more years, but you need to check the statistics, you may not be around THAT long. The statistics for second marriages are not that great, especially when kids are involved. Your husband could be saying to ignore her, when in actuality, he should be encouraging a solid foundation for his child that the two of you could actually have. Is he ignoring her, she should be your friend. Your HUSBAND is not the great guy you think, he gave up on his marriage when there was a child involved. Any relationship can be repaired if people are trying, if he was busy dating you, do you think he was trying to repair his marriage!!! Bottom Line - If he walks out on a child ... he will walk out on you!!!!!!|`|e6c4b2c416a7614f0ecc47e2e66df65faa	I feel for you, I've been in your shoes. My husband's ex cheated on him, divorced him, and married the other guy ten years ago. When we first got married, she made life absolutely unbearable for us.<br>   She kept his son from him every chance she got because she didn't like me. She was just fine until he found someone else. It's been a struggle for several years, but I must admit that it has gotten easier. When the ex realizes that your husband isn't sticking up for your welfare, she is definitely gloating. My husband fortunately has stood up to his ex for me. I have stood up to this woman also on more than one occasion.  You have to stand your ground, too, for your own sanity.  She retaliated by keeping his son from him on my husband's visitation days. She always told him that it was strictly due to me, thinking that my husband would take it out on me, but he never did. Fortunately my husband's family wants nothing to do with her. That's a big problem when there is bitterness in a past relationship.<br>   My ex's family and I are still close because I wasn't the problem in my marriage break up. I get along great with my ex's wife because we weren't competing against one another.She wasn't the cause of our divorce so I had no problem with her. I don't know what your situation is. <br>   Obviously your husband's ex feels like you and she are in competition for some reason. She has the problem. If my ex's current wife felt that she had to compete with me for his family's attention, then there might have been problems, but fortunately that didn't happen.  Each situation is different. Above everything else, Hon, keep his child feeling secure with you and your husband. The child will see, as he grows up, the love that you can give him. My husband's ex has bad-mouthed myself and my husband to his son for six years and now his son is 17 years old and is saying that he sees his mom for the person she is. He is comfortable with his dad and I when he is here and that's what matters. Give his child a loving, stable home and eventually she will lose interest when she realizes that she's not going to cause any friction between you and your husband. I know how hard it can be. I almost gave up my marriage more than once, but realized that this was what she was aiming for. She even called my husband once, after we were engaged, to try to get back with him. It's like, they didn't want them, but they don't want anyone else to have them either. If you had told me five years ago that I would still be in this marriage with my husband after all the problems his ex caused, I wouldn't have believed you. You hang in there if you love your husband and everything will work out. Also, it sure doesn't hurt to pray about it. The Good Lord will most definitely help out. Best of luck to you.|`|eb567e912d8466ee55e7a80afbe3b841aa	I know how you feel as I am in a very similar situation. What is it with these women..they are called X's for a reason...it is especially hard when children are involved because then they start manipulating tactics with the child.  I hope that your husband would express to his parents how much it bothers you that they allow her to run yall down...bringing the grandkid to visit is one thing but allowing her to dog you out is another.  <br>  <br>  Just to let you know, ive been trying the killing her with kindness technique..i dont know if its working or not..we dont see if shes going crazy behind close doors or not...lol..but she still drives me crazy but she doesnt know that because i always have a SMILE....i hope your situation gets better..x wives are a *****!|`|f42be4c411e5c7e3fa86d5743fb608f4aa	Let your husband deal with his ex wife|`|f566157ad49aee669d85f4309eafa81caa	DON'T fuel the fire!!!!

See it from her point of view.  then you may be able to address why she is leaving and improve things or agree with her.|`|AA11512648	Look in life nothing seems to be easy. What I have noticed is that a lot of people are so extremely different. Our society today puts so much pressure on everyone. Lots of people can deal with life's every day pressures and stresses. Some people for whatever reason cannot deal with life issues as well as others, and they feel like the only way out is the easy way out. That way they have no responsibility, noone to care about but themselves. This is so easy for them. As life goes on then they realise they made a big time mistake, then by that time life has passed them by and it is too late. If you will look at the divorce rate today it is extremely high. Something noone shoud be proud of but unfortunately the statistics do not lie. Noone can make your wife want to stay with you and your kids except for her. If she decides to go her own seperate way, really there is not a whole lot you can do about it but do what you have to do. You either end the relationship or do nothing and do the best you can and raise the kids.  Another thing to consider is if you can suggest to your wife that you both go to marriage counseling.  You both need to talk more and understand just why in the world she feels like this. Then there is a chance with a lot of hard work and prayer, (ask God to help you and your wife through this) he will help you and he will help restore your marriage.  God will be there when noone else will be there, he is.|`|AA12349536	Believe me, it is never easy to give up. I would say that this decision has been lingering on her mind for a very long time.

Therefore she may not value it as you do. – hence making it easier for her to step out of it

hw4Im2CTaa	From your question, I'm going to assume that you like a guy who flirts with other girls. So...<br>  Yes, he may like you best.<br>  Yes, he may get nervous around you.<br>  BUT<br>  He may be a player, and trust me, if he truly deeply with all of his heart only liked you, he would do everything he possibly could to make that clear. But maybe not, guys can be weird like that sometimes.|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	you must be young, but yes, youve got it..... im a guy and im like that.... as a guy i flirt alot but it doesnt mean that i like the girl that i flirt with and if i like the girl i flirt with her in a different way.... i treat her  different and i act different... you should see the difference, just look at the big picture!!! if the guy likes you, im sure hes acting weird around you, shy and nervous, tries to make you laugh and thoughtful!!!if he could hardly speak or put hes words togrther then yes totally!!!goodluck!!!|`|Z5BLfE9faa	Yes, thats how I am.

I mean, just because a guy really likes one girl doesn't mean she's going to like him back, so many will flirt with a lot because you never know who's going to want to be with you.  Hell, there are some guys who still flirt even when they're married or dating, lol.|`|ySvWezDdaa	yeah, especially the younger or more immature that they are, they flirt with many to keep their options open or simple to boost their ego.  Once they actually grow up and/or establish some sense of self-worth apart from external justifications, they tend to keep a better focus once they find the one they want to be with, or at least they have a better idea of what qualities they're looking for and they focus on finding someONE with those qualities|`|hwKFm7H8aa	of course...in my 17 years of existence...the girls have touched my penis...I didnt like of them...but there is this one girl that I met just recently..and wow she is special|`|fIoi3HWxaa	Yeah, thats me.|`|qQKOAdSjaa	I can agree with that|`|35c3df911f84beff6b1fc6dff3df6190aa	yea maybe so

gOJ1A5Yoaa	Maybe you need to talk your fears over with your boyfriend... not nessc. about breaking up, but about commitment and what might happen in the future.<br>  <br>  If you're not ready to do that I'd ask yourself what you want from the relationship...Do you see a future with this guy? or do you just want some fun? Either way, if you really like this guy, and you think it COULD work out then see where it goes, and ignore what other people say.<br>  <br>  I would say that you maybe are just a little bit nervous about getting too committed....maybe you've never been in love before? Or in a serious relationship? If so, it takes time to get used to these new situations... just go with the flow and see how things turn out, and if it gets to a point where you fall out of love with this guy, then maybe that's the time to break up- not when you're having one little panic, or when other people tell you to.<br>  <br>  And I'd seriously talk to SOMEONE about your feelings, just to get them off your chest, and so that someone is looking out for you on a daily basis. Make sure it's someone you trust, but it doesn't have to be a close friend, in fact it might help if they didn't really know your bf.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|ROl9Dhqjaa	If you are truly in love with him and are happy together then of course you should stay together. Talk to him about your feelings and work something out that will make you both happy. It's awesome that you have been together for 4 months. And that's NOT true about what his sis said. Just be open with your feelings and talk to him. Hope everything goes well for you!|`|5qKjaq1Daa	if you love him, don't leave him, if he makes you happy, don't listen to others, love is a flash that don't last that long, and if you think it will be forever, well only in the movies, truly exist, live your moment, don't live your life, thinking of the future, you don't know if you will have a future anyhow.  whoever failed in their relationships has nothing to do with you, love him, be happy and that's all!|`|PK5Elowdaa	You're telling yourself the relationship has already failed. Its all in your head. <br>  <br>  Think positive and do your best. Everything will fall into place.|`|pyGQqMXbaa	If that is how you feel, and its just 4 months in, the best thing could be possibly to let him go, if you don't like this decision than you should really communicate to him, because of you can't even communicate to him, then that isn't even really a relationship. Don't lead him on for something worse.|`|MJe4LDY1aa	don't ever EVER fall for anyone<br>  trust me<br>  unless you are in a long term secure relationship<br>  you'll get your heartbroken if you fall in love<br>  unless things are nice and secure sure<br>  but even then love is such a strong word<br>  your always going to have to be ready to move on and brush things off|`|7342BXehaa	it's hard but talk with your boyfriend- some of your thoughs might be what he thinking|`|OOUoZY8Caa	is it your first boyfriend? because I really think girls should date around alot before sticking to one guy, even if they feel in love with their first. I also like to listen to my heart and would recommend that for you. if you break up with him and you really feel terrible about it and can't get over him well then you'll know you made a mistake but if after a break you find yourself thinking about other guyz and moving on, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea.|`|AnRxCLZXaa	it really does sound like you're just afraid of commitment. don't be! his sister is wrong: that is when people who aren't good together/don't love each other break up. you may or may not fit into that category. if you do, then maybe you should break up, but if you don't, then there is no reason to. good luck!|`|GCpnuPNCaa	dont break up with him if you really love him... it will work out give it a chance and if it dosent then i guess he wasnt ment for you but if he loves you and you love him what else matters?? You have to over come these little bumps in the road but thats just my opinion do whatever you fell is best for you but listen to your heart!
4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	I wouldn't say hey, would you be my boyfriend but I don't know how old you are.  I would ask him if we were exclusive and no I don't think it's wrong to ask.  At least you are clear about things. I think more people should be clear with each other as to what they have or don't have.|`|AA11208683	well either he is a slug and doesnt deserve you. or he either want to take things slow and doesn't want to rush into things, which can be good. it shows how mature he is. i think you need to talk to him about this and see what his take is. you can be boyfriend and girlfriend with out loving each other....but getting to know each other. some men just arn't good with labels there just kind of different about that. i am with you about the old fashioned thing, i was like that as well. if you don't feel comfortable you can just give him little hints instead of asking him out loud. but i wouldn't push it if hes a good guy. he will come around on his own if he really likes you. GOOD LUCK and i hope everything works out!|`|BLaEQfdDaa	is just you n him only, he isn't dating on the side also??? but some guys don't like Big C word, depending on his past relationships if they were good or bad??? Its scary for a guy, when he feels comfortable he will let you know. the key things about moving to the next step depending on ur ages, and where you live, do u guys have stay overs, do you have clothes at his place or yours, did you exchange house keys things like that. but more or less it depends how he feels about things, just be honest and open is really important for couples to move forward.|`|4a3240c13f7f2fd3e4ad92aafe2eb7b5aa	If he was really that interested, he would ask you.  Men like to do the asking, even in this modern age.  Be patient and give it time or he might turn you down and then it will spoil your friendship.|`|1Akk3hZyaa	you should ask him, although its probably one of those things he thought didn't need to ask you.|`|bO2rzfISaa	I didn't know this step existed and I'm 46. For me it's always just happened naturally, no asking or telling.|`|n8lXItGraa	It's just a label..it won't change the way you feel about each other.  Maybe in time he will use those words.  If you enjoy the time you spend with him, be patient.  Either love will bloom, or it will not.  3 months is not a long time.  You'll know when it's right.  Hope this helps...|`|15Uz3lO2aa	Be like... "this guy asked me out for dinner... I'm not interested of course, but it got me thinking.... can I officially call you my boyfriend?"<br>  <br>  Not in a way to make him jealous, but in a way that points out that it's necessary to put a label on your relationship after this amount of time.|`|CQsD09D6aa	You can ask for clarification of your relationship. Is it exclusive? Does he love you? Where is it going? Ask away. I would.|`|UxRoUTvCaa	It's fine to ask.|`|c2da9d6744cd0c23d5d0b9b9300338a7aa	He has said that he has strong feelings for you, if you are sleeping with him, then you very much might want to talk to him about both you and him being with others. Ask him how he feels about that, and hopefully he will say no, to seeing other women. Wa La, he's your boyfriend if that's the case.  It is not old fashion to ask him where you stand and what he wants.
AuSjEjtMaa	talkative...but not to the point where its annoying<br>  shy...but not to the point where the silence is awkward.<br>  Somewhere right in the middle|`|rUk58ywKaa	I tend to be rather shy myself, so I much prefer a talkative girl.  Otherwise it is too difficult to maintain conversations and prevent awkward silences.|`|RUD2N3Sqaa	a bit of both but a bit more talkative as long as u dont think ur annoying anyone because guys hate shy girls and to much annoying girls thats y i say a bit of both goodluck|`|Z8cBPUlkaa	something more talkative :D... its annoying to be in silence :D...|`|saLt3jSoaa	i like a girl right in the middle cuz if she talks to much ill want to kill myself and if she is shy its really boreing to be around|`|MJe4LDY1aa	i like a confident girl <br>  one that could be comfortable around me<br>  it would be awkward being with a girl thats non-talkative and uncomfortable|`|v15npNiUaa	Talkative.<br>  It's definetely better than shy because then you get to know each other better and you can hang out at ease.|`|lbEdcFSNaa	Shy, because people that talk alot are annoying, I'm very shy myself aswell.|`|lu7enc3yaa	talkative because shy girls are boring as sh*t|`|cBtFp2aYaa	a lil bit of both bacause im shy but talkative|`|QL12LD5daa	i <33 GUyS WHO ARE NOT AFRAiD TO EXPRESS THEMSE,VES<br>  <br>  <br>  <33|`|5qKjaq1Daa	a little of it of both|`|zHZOxfbVaa	like right in between|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	I'm a girl but I'm both shy and talkative. I have to get used to someone to be really talkative though. If I get to know someone then they can't get me to shut up but at first I get all nervous around them and everything lol! ~I LOVE Derek|`|Zi2Sw3ngaa	shy...i can relate   :)  to that..|`|qsZPkbF2aa	I'd like to date a girl who is somewhere in-between. I like being around people who know how to listen and respond, versus the types that don't let you get a sentence in. In my opinion, talkative women don't seem to take life very seriously as compared to a shy woman. That's not to say I want a woman who's so shy she doesn't want to socially interact with other people. That's why being in the middle works.|`|VSXUa9lraa	I'm not a guy, but I'll still answer.<br>  My boyfriend started dating me because I was a mix between both, I'm shy but I'm super outgoing just depends on my mood and what is going on.<br>  My boyfriend's brother dated a girl that was shy and he HATED it. There was other reasons why they broke up though.|`|1Kxxwjjdaa	in the middle cuz if they're like this. "Oh my god today I saw a truck and it looked just like yours!!!!!!! Then I got a burger and it tasted sooooooooooooooooo good." I try to say somthing. "Oh well gotta go bye!!" And if there shy u sit there is silence. Like this. <br>  <br>  "Hey (insert grl name here)." they say "..........................................

Talkative girls are sometimes annoying and trash talkers and shy girls make me shy|`|tDnD7Uqgaa	My husband always says be yourself only then will you find a guy that accepts you for who you are. Take me I'm loud and don't care what I say. My sister is shy and we both found men who love and cherish us. An we didn't have to change one bit.|`|wNtBzGGYaa	In the middle. too talkative is annoying. but shy sucks.|`|LWtz8cGsaa	Well, it depends of other things too, shyness can be cute in some girl if is combined with other things.|`|hwKFm7H8aa	in the middle..if she talks to much..Id be like "shut your mouth and go make me a sandwhich" if she is too shy " I wouldnt know whatto say"|`|pf5G6ssJaa	talkative but not annoying
x0XB2ASWaa	yeah  i have some like that. and if i were you, id ditch her.|`|00A3BfSEaa	ya my friend is always liek that|`|3NQizLOKaa	i have no friends i dont gotta worry about that :)|`|LV6AeCfdaa	yeah my friend is like that, except im the good one compared to her. my parents think im bad because of things she finds funny. one day she threw a chunk of ice at our glass door, and ever since my dad blames it all on me. it's funny, the stupid little things that change your whole outlook on life.|`|F57ep5jHaa	i think your parents love who you are, so don't care about what your friends grade is. don't let it get to you.|`|X9Xt16dbaa	your parents love you. everyone is nice to their friends parents. its just how it is.<br>  <br>  I don't have any friends like this girl your talking about.
GLBWe3A9aa	When i say something to my girlfriend i do it.<br>  And im not in the relationship for sex.<br>  I hate it when people say every boy is in it for sex, it's so untrue|`|hKax9Jl6aa	My ex did the same thing. He never done a thing he said, which caused a problem in our relationship and trust. Guys will say things that they want you to hear, but deep inside knows that they're not going to do it anyways. The true colors comes out and the girl stops dealing with them. It's just a way for the guy to get the girl to like them.|`|2jzb9wnoaa	It's just in their nature.|`|VgiUGqxtaa	Ask the same question, but replace the "guys" with "girls"...<br>  <br>  Because when a guy says "Im going to buy a T-shirt, he means Im going to buy a t-shirt.<br>  <br>  when a girls says i'm going to buy a t-shirt, she means:<br>  <br>  Im going to buy a t-shirt from Tkmaxx, but first i have to get some petrol, before stopping @ the dry cleaners to hand in this bed sheet, then when i get to tkmaxx, i'll but the tshirt, a skirt and a nice scarf to go with it...|`|GId5bF3iaa	They tell you what you want to hear, but then they decide to do what they had planned all along.|`|PK5Elowdaa	We can say the same about females....|`|WKBK4BI8aa	They all want the same thing: sex. I know it's overused, and some people overlook it as a cliche used by parents to scare kids away from underage sex, but it's really all they want. I have many guy friends, and they all say the same thing when I ask them for advice. Guys talk, and they brag (it's all an ego thing) and they will do anything to have sex. Just by knowing that, you can tell a lot of the time if they are "lying" to you or not. Guys sometimes say things that are really sweet, and you might think "aww, he's the sweetest," but he's probably expecting something back in return. And sometimes if he doesn't get it, he'll go looking for it.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	It's just a guy thing. They do this to get a rise out of you. You will never find one that doesn't do this. Good Luck!
JtEBaOdjaa	Go with 7.  The ceremony won't be done til about 6:15(if you start at 5:45) then you need pictures.  So I'd go with 7pm.<br>  <br>  btw, LOVE the beach wedding idea. that'll be so nice<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: we all knew what you meant by 2 miles. that person just made a silly answer|`|7CKipTZOaa	No it is not too late, maybe just ensure there is something for your guests to snack on.keep occupied with and it will be fine, guests will understand you need time for photos and the like and can even enjoy the beach for a bit before heading to your reception. all the best!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Not at all - and since you need to get photos done, maybe plan cocktails from 6 to 7, then dinner at 7.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	No. Many people say they don't even start the ceremony until 7pm.|`|ckJP6TTQaa	I would take photos before the ceremony, if possible. <br>  <br>  It isn't too late, but you would be getting kind of rushed. It takes time for people to get their stuff together, get back up the beach to their cars, drive around the corner, get out, etc. So if the ceremony is ending at 6:30, then I wouldn't plan on the reception starting until 7pm anyway. And then, are you having a receiving line? That takes time. What about a social/cocktail hour? You could be looking at not starting dinner until 7:45 or 8pm -- which is getting rather late. <br>  <br>  At my wedding, the reception starts at 6pm. We're planning on having 1 hour for people to mingle and get a drink, then start dinner at 7pm.|`|8c7cc680a9dfdc46cf7a06e1622558bbaa	Not at all.<br>  <br>  I would probably go for 7 p.m though if I were you. I would definitely make sure you have enough time for photos. Since it is only 2 miles away that should be plenty of time to take photos and make it to your reception.|`|AcsvmXY4aa	7pm is a perfect time to start the reception|`|HU7uZifYaa	I think it will be fine if you have your reception at 7pm. Lots of people do night weddings/receptions.|`|ERWiypdYaa	i dont belive that 6:30 is to late to have the recption.|`|hkwBR1moaa	My reception isn't starting till 8:30pm and will be over at 11:30pm.  So no, I don't think it'll be too late.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	6:30 or 7 would be an appropriate time for a reception AS LONG AS you serve dinner. That's right around everyone's dinnertime, so you can't get away with serving just cake and punch unless you want people to say mean things about your hostessing abilities behind your back.

6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	You both need to see a marriage counselor /therapist. I say both of you because YOU need to vent,  express your anger and relate your feelings of disappointment to a professional. He obviously is a compulsive liar and it is not something he has only been doing since he has been married. He probably has insecurity and self-esteem problems, which if he does not confront them, they will undoubtedly cost his marriage. There is nothing worse than a liar, I totally agree with you and understand your anger and frustration. If he does not want to go, then he is probably afraid to 'face his demons' and will never change for you or... anybody.<br>  Good luck.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	Habitual liars are typically men who are so insecure they try to make themselves more important by lying.  They don't view it as lying, which is important to remember.  Only therapy can help to correct this situation.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	You already know the answer, kick him to the curb|`|RYCMFLMuaa	kick him out he is doing my friends wife...|`|xPeIvywdaa	unfortunely, this is just a big part of some peoples personality<br>  <br>  since honesty is so important to you, im suprised you didnt find this conflict before you were married<br>  <br>  if he cant change his behavoir, i dont know what to reccomend besides learning when he lieing and telling the truth and only trusting him in the truthful moments|`|5SmX1oLlaa	everyone tells white lies every now and then some you should just let it go. but if it a serious lie then you need to make up your mind weather you want to live with that lie. you need to see a marriage councilor.|`|AjBpAPpdaa	You should see a family councellor with him, also, If I can;t take it anymore I would leave him--I will tell him how I honestly feel about it and how it's ruining your relationship,|`|CQsD09D6aa	Me? I would run for the hills. You cannot have a proper relationship built on lies. Trust is important.|`|80A6iHoGaa	Divorce|`|lb8FBhWnaa	marriage counseling|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Sorry to say this, but your husband is abusing you. He is wearing you down emotionally an mentally...and sooner or later this will mean your health will suffer as well.<br>  <br>  Liars, cheaters and abusive men seldom- if ever-change. They have deep, emotional problems stemming from childhood; and they can only help themselves if they accept they have a problem and seek professional help- like counseling or therapy.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Please remember you cannot change him or MAKE him stop lying. Trust and honesty are key ingredients in a marriage.<br>  <br>   If you cannot trust your spouse, what the heck kind of marriage do you have?<br>  Think about it!<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  About abuse…How are you affected?<br>  <br>  * Are you unable or afraid to make decisions for yourself?<br>  * Do you do anything you can to please your partner or not upset him?<br>  * Do you make excuses for your partner's behaviour?<br>  * Are you forgetful, confused or unable to concentrate?<br>  * Have you noticed changes in your eating, sleeping, alcohol or drug use?<br>  * Have you lost interest or energy to do the things you used to?<br>  * Do you feel sick, anxious, tired or depressed a lot of the time?<br>  * Have you lost contact with your friends, family or neighbours?<br>  * Have you lost self-confidence and feel afraid that you could not make it alone?<br>  <br>  What can you do about it?<br>  <br>  * Realize that emotional abuse is a serious problem and you can get help.<br>  * Recognize that emotional abuse is as bad or worse than physical abuse.<br>  * Take your own safety and the safety of your children seriously.<br>  * Know that emotional abuse can lead to physical violence or death.<br>  * Know that you are not to blame for your partner's abusive behaviour.<br>  * Find people to talk to that can support you. Consider going for counselling.<br>  * Do not give up if community professionals are not helpful. Keep looking for<br>  * Someone that will listen to you and take emotional abuse seriously.<br>  * Recognize that you have the right to make your own decisions, in your own time, and that dealing with any form of abuse may take time.<br>  * Trust yourself and your own experiences. Believe in your own strengths. Remember that you are your own best source of knowledge and strength, and that you already have the tools you need to survive.|`|yQfaj7c2aa	The most difficult thing about lying is you don't know then what he is capable of lying about. Trust is the cornerstone of any marriage, it is based on this. If you are interested in attempting to work things out you will likely need to see a marriage counselor in order to get him to understand how important this is to you, as well as to understand how he is damaging the marriage and you! In my opinion there are lines you just don't cross in marriage -both have to do with trust, one is lying, the other is cheating. Counseling will help! I am currently in my last year of school for my master's in Marriage and family therapy and can tell you that you shouldn't take this lightly -this has the potential to turn into a HUGE issue for you -if it hasn't already.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Take care!|`|35770bf8f2d8c67783b3ab4e50bf146caa	Tell him that when he lies about little things, you don't know if he lies about everything else too, and really important things. Tell him that until he changes, you're not going to believe anything he says.<br>  <br>  And then whenever he says anything, do the opposite. If he says he's full, put more food on his plate, etc.<br>  <br>  It works for kids. I don't know if it will work in this case... otherwise, I agree, go see a therapist/counselor.|`|cm7dLGQPaa	Well I guess it depends on where you want to be a year from now..cause he's not going to change.  Do you still want to be going through this constantly?  If not, then I think its time to move on.  If you want to continue to put up with this, then I guess hang around.  I  personally would reevaluate my life and decide that I would not want  to be having to deal with this year after year and would move on.  But yes, its your decision and perhaps a conselor could help you sort it out.|`|2n0vR0OMaa	Marriage is hard work and compromise. Again,Tell him about your desperation and how it makes you feel, that you want to resolve this rather than be another divorce statistic.(which I presume is what you want too!) Try to talk calmly talking about how you feel using I statements rather than "YOU always..."etc.. and not in the heat of the moment. Seek professional help together.|`|2ce87ef838b3c546c942a9b12750c8abaa	Did you know this before you were married?  Seems impossible to not have known.  <br>  In your wedding vows you made some promises and commitments. <br>  <br>  Why does he lie?  That is the question.  <br>  Have you sought out professional help?  This type of lying  is a compulsion, he needs help to begin to work on it.  <br>  Good luck|`|7cdc801bdb4ad5ebfe07957d02070809aa	He maybe pathological liar. He know that what he tells is not the truth but is unable to control the urge to lie.<br>  Professional help of psycholog is needed to break the fear of telling the truth you may compare this to the fear of flying.|`|kQ5h3kmqaa	See a family therapist.|`|4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	Give him his walking papers.  Lying is not cool. Period.|`|cts6S8vRaa	Maybe he is covering up because he doesn't want to hurt you or let you down.|`|1EoTIZl8aa	I can't stand liars. Ask him if he's full of ****.|`|gfXCE6LOaa	I catch my husband in lies all the time as well even about the smallest things that wouldn't even matter. He says he does this because I can occasionally over react some when he does something or something happens. He feels that he can avoid all confrontations by simply telling me what I want to hear. My husband has always been very unconfrontational and avoids fighting with me or anyone at all costs if possible. I understand your frustrations and there isn't much you can do but I try to not sweat the small stuff when he does tell me the truth now. I'm not sure if your husband is having the same problem as mine but I thought I would share it with you in hopes that it helps!|`|kYXVb8AZaa	Hey there, <br>  <br>   I know the feeling. My fiance does the same thing. He will move something and forget where he put it. Then after ranting and raving and blaming everyone else for touching it, he finds it (right where he left it) and still will insist that someone else moved it on him. Even when he finds it hidden in his sock drawer, go figure.. We were supposed to have gotten married a couple years ago, but I just couldn't do it. I know somewhat what you are going through and I wish you the best. I don't have a whole lot of advice, except, don't put up with it and continue to constantly call him out on it. Never give in and know that he is lying, but humor him as if you don't know. By always confronting him, you are more likely to get him to quit or at least let up on it a little. But if you humor him, he will think he is getting away with it and will continue to do so.<br>  <br>   Best of Luck!|`|bO2rzfISaa	Compulsive liars lie about everything. I'd divorce him. I wouldn't be married to someone I didn't trust.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Honestly, if I were you, I wouldn't have married him in the first place if I knew he was a liar. If you are willing to put in a lot of work to make your marriage stronger you should look into counseling. If you aren't willing, you should cut your losses and leave.
ObicYeTdaa	cover him in chocolate! haha<br>  i think you know where im going with this...|`|pwiRMmicaa	watch some porn and learn from the best lol.<br>  or do whatever make you feel better and try on him.(if you uderstand)
hYRP0x2Eaa	Completely understandable. You don't owe your mom anything for being born. She could have done it for her own selfish reasons or maybe it was a total accident. And a lot people will say you should be happy that you didn't get aborted...why though? Your mom wasn't doing you a favor, she just didn't want to feel guilty for the rest of her life. But this all depends on the mom of course. I love mine, but I understand why others don't love theirs. Why would anyone expect a person to love their mom after she abused them or treated them like garbage? Mother is just a name...it means nothing in the end. What matters is how that person treats you and loves you. If they do it poorly, then you have no obligation to them.|`|q2jyVemOaa	I do. No matter how hard i try i guess its not good enough. I honestly don't have any solutions right now but just keep holding on to the few things in life that bring joy to your life. besides true happiness can only be found in your heart. =]|`|m3NVpPpiaa	Find a way to make amends.

She doesn't deserve you anyway.|`|NvgowkZzaa	I would be upset and pissed off. Just ignore her, don't make an effort towards her and don't talk to her. I would be furious.

Good luck|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	learn the game, son. refuse to play it. put her in the trashcan of your memory and be grateful that that was all that it cost you|`|qy07K2k5aa	I would feel very hurt and upset, but I would do my best to get over it.|`|xfj1B7YSaa	been there dont that boy. i felt horrible. but u know wat??? y care about a person like that? its knda a cliche but u deserve better. we deserve better. u should go up to her and confront her about wat you feel and ask why she would hurt and wat not. <br>  <br>  find another girl and forget about that b***h.|`|VSXUa9lraa	I wouldn't be friends with that.<br>  I would of taken the necklace back too.|`|kdmhuVTEaa	Annoyed.<br>  But i'd brush it off.<br>  There's plenty more fish in the sea.|`|QtJH37KRaa	well hunny that's being lied to not used. Maybe shes just not ready, she tried it twice so did you. you may still like her but id leave it be for now if its meant to be then it will be. Go out with different girls your young, date! don't be tied down its no fun at 15! <br>  I know you are feeling down, but if it makes you feel any better I moved in with my ex, and he left me for a "break"  then we got back together and then he left me to go "pursue" some else. (who uses that word!? maybe in a 1800's novel but not in normal english!) THEN we got back together, and found out we were going to have a baby (at which i miscarried) and then he left me for a 17 year old, note he is 25.<br>  <br>  SO not only does it happen when you are 15, but when you are older too.
XB996f1naa	dr. Laura's book proper care and feeding of husbands. your library should have it. if at all possible take a little time off and go on a date or even take a mini vacation. he feels awful about being unemployed. im sure. make an effort to do little things for him like cook his favorite dish etc. anything you know that he likes do it for him. communication is also very important. i hate to say it but it is very important for you to make this effort or the relationship is going to suffer. at the same time i bet you are exhausted from all of this work and he needs to realize that it is not all about him either. it sounds like your life is not balanced enough. as hard as it may be try to take the time to make him happier. i would also recommend that you hire a babysitter one day a week so he can have a break.i would also make an effort to verbally acknowledge your appreciation of him daily. this is something that most men can not live without.men are really little boys in mens bodies they never grow up. i am sure you really want what is best for him. i wish you the best of luck in your situation!|`|le2JAAO1aa	I would maybe make it a point to thank him for cleaning and stuff, like "oh hunny! thank you so much for cleaning up the house, it looks great!"  or when your playing with your daughter talk to her while he's around and say things like " someone looks beautiful today who could have made our baby look so pretty? was it daddy?" lol those kind of things. Hugs are always good too.  Sorry if it's corny but sometimes cheesy things work. good luck!|`|AlhVF4xaaa	I am a stay at home mom and feel the same way your husband does sometimes. Leave a little note telling him how much you appreciate everything he does. Bring home a gift. It doesn't have to be big. Maybe a favorite beer or treat and tell him thank you. Give him a massage. It's nice to know that you are appreciated. Good luck!|`|KJAKihaCaa	guys need to be the breadmaker|`|HL8PEDFLaa	Compliment him, try taking over the chores once in a while, give him something extra in the bedroom, keep a positive attitude, etc. Just think of what you would like him to do for you if you were in that situation.
2o3BHgCCaa	From $350 for the destinations range to $1900 for their premium dresses (sottero and midgeley and some maggie sottero dresses).<br>  The average does seem to be US$700 or so though.<br>  <br>  I don't know where you are from, but in Australia the desitnations gowns start at $1200 and the high end can be $3000+. $2000 is the average here.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	When I was looking for new ones, the prices varied from $500-$1800.  <br>  <br>  I got a fantastic deal on my used Maggie.  I searched high and low to find one at a good deal.  I looked at new and used ones on ebay and craigslist.com - I finally found a used one for $140 on craigslist.com.  It was originaly $1200, so I was delighted to get one for so inexpensive.  It's perfect - exactly what I was looking for!  Good luck!|`|qcy86nbcaa	it depends on where you live. some areas they can average around 3000 and some areas they average 700. depending on where you buy the dress the cost may be different. whatever the price is though you should definatly buy a maggie dress. they are by far the most well made and beautiful dresses around that price range. enjoy your wedding!|`|AA10086844	All of the ones that I tried on (Victoriana, Anne Marie, Aurielle, and Edwina Marie) were all between $1100 and $1600.|`|YsiJiOqXaa	The ones I was ooking at were around the $700 range. It depends.

kfWi9ZkEaa	You have to treat her like a future mother-in-law and not burn any bridges, but also forge a relationship as well.<br>  <br>  Go speak to her on her own one day and raise your concern.  Ask her what's happening, and ask with humility and gentleness because you could be to some degree getting the wrong end of some obscure, family type stick that predates you.  <br>  <br>  Maybe she doesn't think you're good enough but this behaviour is quite disconcerting:  a MIL who doesn't think the girl is good enough should never, ever indicate such a thing because she could end up never allowed to see the grandkids.  The only time I would intimate someone wasn't good enough is if I knew they were absolutely good enough, and thought they knew I knew, and so I could joke about it.<br>  <br>  I don't know what your situation is though, but I highly recommend you go have a chat with her, tell her the consequences of what she's saying, ask her if that is what is going on.  <br>  <br>  In short, be real with her, be honest, but maintain sweetness of disposition because she may have no idea of the impact on you she's having, she may have no idea she's even doing this: it may be an oversight, or an old joke, or some flaming thing.  Or you may be misunderstanding, or she may unconsciously be triggering your boyfriend's immaturity.<br>  <br>  <br>  OR: AND THIS IS A BIG OR she may think your boyfriend is not good enough for you. Shey may think he doesn't treat you well enough, so she gives him opportunities to treat you badly, which shows you that your boyfriend is not up to standard without her having to say anything.  Sometimes mothers aren't thrilled at their sons.<br>  <br>  The above is an obscure one: it may be happening but it's not very likely.  The only person who knows what's going on with her, is herself, and you're going to have to ask her to find out.<br>  <br>  :o)|`|m3NVpPpiaa	Ask your boyfriend to find out what her deal is. Sounds like she wants to break you guys up. Don't let her! You need your boyfriend to lobby for the two of you.|`|IikTFnCxaa	Well, maybe she is concerned about how close you two are getting or maybe she feels you are getting very serious..Either way, continue to be nice and drop it...If you try to make your boyfriend make a choice, mom will win hands down and it makes you look petty and insecure...Just accept her the way she is and let it go...Maybe you should start spending more time at your house and give his parents a break for awhile...She might come around too, if she sees you aren't going anywhere...|`|J9sUlpX8aa	To be honest, we all have these problems with in-laws. I remember the first time I met my mother in law, it was about 2-3 months into the relationship and we met up at theirs. It was a straight up personality clash from the start: she preferred WCW, I was a straight up WWF (now WWE...gah) fan. It was around the time Hogan went to the WCW and she threw it right into my face. 'Course, we all now how that turned out so I won in the end.<br>  <br>  Look at me, rambling: point is, things like this happen but you can still be happily married without a problem
BUFgf2S2aa	That was really rude.  How selfish of her.  I think you have every right to be hurt and insulted, but I'd keep a close eye to not let her behavior turn you into a bridezilla.  Face it, years from now you'll want to remember your wedding and all the build up to the ceremony with fondness and not make this the big issue that pops into your mind first and foremost.  For that purpose, I don't know if I'd go directly to dis-inviting her.  I don't know if she's not typically such a flake - or if she has such a poor self-image or what.  Those things might make me look more compassionately at the situation...but I do think you are perfectly within your rights to call her up with a friendly tone and ask if you can have just a little bit of her time.  I think it would be ok to tell her that you were hurt by the behavior, just to give her an opportunity to apologize (face it, her explaining things isn't what you're after because there's very little in the way of excuses that would make her actions ok.  You're looking for her to validate your feelings and to acknowledge that she was in the wrong).|`|qRIMM2ycaa	I'd ask her if she actually wants to come to your wedding.<br>  <br>  Make it clear that you're very hurt by her actions, and it wasted a lot of money someone spent for her. Let her know itt costs quite a bit of money to seat and feed someone at a wedding, and if she's going to run off halfway through, maybe it's better if she didn't come.<br>  Don't just uninvite her, but put the option in her lap.|`|dpk9n2SSaa	I think she was very rude and you should let her know that you do not appreciate her rude behavior, especially if someone else paid for her to come down to be there for you. However, I think you should take the high road and tell her that even though you are hurt, you would still like her to be at the wedding. That way, it is up to her. Maybe she will realize that she was wrong, apologize, and your friendship will still be intact. If she does not apologize, then you did everything you could to keep the friendship so it is on her. I wish you the very best!|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	If you don't mind nasty cheap low life skanks, then don't withdraw the invitation; if you truly do not want or need her in your life anymore, then tell her she is no longer invited, I would do the same thing in your shoes.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	You aren't being a bridezilla. That was really rude of her.<br>  <br>  Before you revoke her invite consider this: once you do your friendship will never recover.  She'll be out of your life for good.  Is that worth it to you?|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Speak to her.  Tell her how hurt you are.  It wasn't any old night out it was your hen night and she was there because other people had paid for her tickets and room.  If she didn't want to be there she didn't have to go.  <br>  <br>  I would be very annoyed if one of my friends acted like this.  It is complete ignorance|`|1M90Aoytaa	i dont think you can revoke an invite - although what she has dont isn't really on. personally i wouldnt have ruined my night for her. Why dont you go around and discuss with her why you are upset. She was out of line but are you prepared to let this totally ruin your freindship or can you talk and forgive her - do you really want to take away her wedding invite??!|`|WzKrZoHQaa	She was out of order, bad mannered and very rude and so on strength of that I'd say yes revoke the invitation.  Tell her these are not the actions of a sensible woman especially one that had agreed to be at yr Hen night then made a total fool of herself - actually she showed herself up big time and you just don't need this on yr wedding day.  Explain that in light of her actions on yr Hen Night you feel it would no longer be appropriate for tghe invitation to remain open and therefore you are taking the unfortunate and drastic step of withdrawing the invitation with immediate effect  DO make it clear that should she still try to turn up - thinking you are just having a hissy fit and will allow her access to yr day - then she will be asked to leave.<br>  <br>  Good luck for yr day but you have to consider the other guests too and their wives/partners and if she is that flighty who knows what suggestions she could be making to yr male guests - gross.    Totally inappropriate to have her presence on the day|`|YqBFguzpaa	It's quite a big thing to uninvite someone. <br>  Now that you know she is so selfish, just let it go. Just mostly gnore her at your wedding day, don't give yourself a big headache revoking her invitation. Don't go out of your way to be mean, it may be more trouble than it's worth. Your wedding day should be about you and your husband, don't waste any more time on her.<br>  <br>  I suppose if there's someone else you'd rather invite instead of her you could. You may be in for a lot of hassle from her though and long term feud. Whereas if you just let it go you can naturally drift apart after the wedding and not worry about it any more.

Just be TOTALLY confident and then walk away with a grin. You'll thank me later. This has worked for several friends of mine.|`|hf5RgDzwaa	so is it that you cant talk to them? or they dont talk to you?<br>  <br>  still confused on that<br>  but if they dont talk to you why dont you go up to them and try it out|`|FcqDWdF1aa	Nervous.Scared probably.|`|MGfFDZnLaa	looks arent everything. hows your personality?|`|o5piRiBsaa	You're probably shy and afraid of being rejected.|`|pwiRMmicaa	whoa! that's pretty impressive,<br>  but those girls probably think ur taken or waaiting for you to talk to them. have a conversation wit dem!|`|Rqqb2hkZaa	Lack of confidence. Hence the reason you are asking this question.|`|1CRbzkABaa	It has to do with the confidence issue just work on being more out going and a lil loud practice when your with your friends. It may be you have trouble because its always scary to make the initial contact. If there is one thing I am good at is being a good talker. The secret is not to care what people say, if your a student walk into class and start a random conversation with a classmate. Just look in the mirror and gain confidence if your getting the looks you got what it takes. If you get shy in public just try to think that everyone is going through the same thing. And if you just remember that not to worry about what people say it will dramatically help you. And if you do something where people laugh at you its perfect because people always love it when someone can make them laugh. And you can use this as a tactic to begin the conversation or to say hello. There is a lot more you can work on, and things to work on your own confidence.|`|FcfSIJQcaa	You're probably a little afraid. My man had the same problem when we met, he was very shy. But you know what I fell in love with him and we learned to talk to each other it took awhile but we finally arrived. Maybe if you try a little harder to talk to a woman than being afraid may go away. Just give yourself a little push and who knows you may find someone very lucky. And if she is a good woman she we will work through it with you.|`|TiJ9ZISGaa	honestly this does work ignore them, i mean just show that you are uninterested in them, then they will not think they are so hot then, ha ha. that actually works, but the best thing is to be yourself, another thing is do you really imagine yourself being with her, could you stand her after a week? is she right for you, may be the first question to ask before talking.<br>  <br>  BTW are you wearing deodorant?|`|5I2yEyOQaa	Just picture them in a bikini.  If that doesn't work try scooby doo boxers.  Main thing is to  have a sense of humor girls like that and they like a guys who is confident and not conceited.  Ask a girl what here interests are.

My brother in law got laid off. My husband just got a job after been unemployed for 4 months. I'm currently working. I hate my job but because of the economy the way it is, there is no other job out there for me at this time. So I'm stuck. I'm so depressed that I haven't been able to sleep. I go to bed and I'm not sleepy at all. I hate to see my love ones worried. I don't know what to do.|`|ee3N1lpQaa	my dad works for himself so no
c27920620869d3d5b40c4f7c78b6b42aaa	If you do buy her something, make it something simple, a sterling silver bangle bracelet, or something that is easy to return and doesn't put a lot of pressure on her. Something to fancy might scare her off. I've seen it happen before. <br>  <br>  Another option that is just as sweet, but doesn't imply as much or put as much pressure on her is giving her some flowers. Plus you don't have to worry that the flowers you pick out are not her taste. Imagine if she got home and there were a dozen roses waiting for her with a note that says. "I'm in love with you." It would make her swoon. <br>  <br>  Another thing to think about is that you can't go in too strong, too fast. You buy her jewelery now, and she will expect more on your first christmas, anniversary, ect ect ect. Go in slow and simple and build up the value of your gifts as the relationship builds.|`|D3bLcWNsaa	thats really cute not a bribe at all. maybe you could have the jewlery say on it "i love you" <br>  very sweet :)|`|X9Xt16dbaa	Not a bribe. ?|`|maVptaMZaa	It's a lovely thought.  I wouldn't advise slipping it into her handbag though because if she's like a lot of women (me anyway) there is so much stuff in my handbag that she may be inclined not to come across it for a few days, or more.  You could maybe leave it in a prominent place in her apartment somewhere she will notice it after you have gone.  Not the hand bag though, bad idea.
og9mxwK4aa	I live in GA...<br>  you cannot get married unless you are 18 or your legal guardian allows you to. <br>  My husband is in the service and we weren't married when he went to basic. And even if you get pregnant the military won't let you move with him or consider him a married service member until you actually get married. But once you do get married.. even after he gets stationed... they will let you move in with him.|`|hVrfm4eIaa	The specific requirements for the marriage license depend on the county but it seems like most Georgia counties require written consent from both parents for anyone under 18 unless the bride is pregnant or the couple already has a child.  It might be possible to get around the parental consent requirement if you become legally emanicipated but I don't know exactly what that process would entail.  <br>  <br>  On a side note, seventeen is pretty young to get married.  Would you be willing to wait a while?  I met my husband when I was 15 but we waited until I was 21 to get married.  That allowed me to finish my undergraduate education.  The first year of marriage is stressful and we didn't even have to deal with deployments.  I understand that a long-distance relationship isn't ideal but, once you get married, you will have forever together.|`|7aoHmM4baa	if your parents don agree<br>  wait until 18 to be legal to get married without somebody s agreement
9KQwu3oUaa	Something really similar happened like that to me. <br>  I guess men are just like that, maybe?<br>  What I did was I asked my mom to talk to him about it. Then he took the pictures of girls in bathing suits off his computer. Like you said, it's not really a huge deal. It's kind of weird to know that your dad looks at stuff like that, though. Either confront him, or write him a letter or e-mail if it's really bothering you that much. I'm sure he'll be willing to work it out. <br>  <br>  :)|`|aXYiOskmaa	oh geez, let it go.|`|21RH8bo8aa	i found text messages from another woman on my dads phone in a simular situation. I confronted him about it( after waiting a few days to see if he got anymore texts), and he confessed and ended the relationship with that woman( for a little while). Confront your father about it, and see what the background story is. Hear his explaination before telling your mother. Its not really your place to tell your mother, or your responsibility. Dont be angry with your father, and dont let him turn the talk around to where he is accusing you of invading his space, thats not what the talk is about.  My mom eventually found out on her own, and they got through it and now their marriage is stronger.|`|FmvnC8keaa	Well that is gross. There are a number of males out there who enjoy looking at pictures of naked girls, as gross as it is. The fact that you saw it on your dad's phone, that seems like it would scar me for life. Any way, I think you should tell your parents that you need to talk with them after dinner. Have both of them be there, and tell them what you saw, and how it makes you feel, etc.|`|2Uc7PZOMaa	i think that you should be nnice to hiiim and ask him do you and mama really like each other|`|FFrSdS2Daa	It is a big deal.<br>  How would your mum feel if she saw that instead of you??<br>  Tell your mum immediatly before it leads into something far more serious.<br>  <br>  When you say it looks too staged do you mean it looks like the pic has been taken proffesionaly with the background and everything??<br>  so basically your dad is looking at porn for satisfaction instead of looking at your mum? Which he should be doing instead.<br>  <br>  I think you should really tell your mum. Or at least speak to your dad about it first. Ask him why that pic is even on his phone.<br>  Try and get some strraight answers from him. Or get your parents to speak about it together so that there's no secrets or jumping to conlclusions.<br>  Hope this helps you. :)|`|mCpC4Zjbaa	I don't really understand. Was he sent the picture by someone else or was it just a download? <br>  <br>  You really can't get the downlow without asking him, and it may not be something him or you is comfortable talking about. It could be ANYTHING. One of his guy friends could have sent him a picture of their new gf or someone they think is hot for advice or bragging rights. Or maybe some girl is hitting on him. You have no idea and he is your dad, so I doubt anyone on here is going to know. I do know that your dad and your mom have been married for twenty years, which is a lot longer than a large amount of marriages last, so they must have a very strong relationship. <br>  <br>  Also, I really don't think it is anything for you to worry about. Even though he is a dad, he is also a guy, and guys like looking at naked girls. Even if it's not to be pervy. Their attraction to the opposite sex is a male thing and it's what helps them feel bonded with their male pals. A lot of girls, and guys, don't realize how important bonding is to the male sex. They might be drawn to doing the "typical male thing" without any bad intention.<br>  <br>  and I agree with "2shy2see" that is an awesome solution if you can pull it off!!!<br>  <br>  I don't agree with anyone who says to tell your mom! I know personally my mom has been hurt before and she feels a little insecure now that she is getting older, so it might make her really upset unneccessarily if nothing is going on. I would never want to hurt my mum though, so I might do a little digging for some concrete answers, and eventually tell her if it was serious.|`|795lSvkhaa	Depending on how close you are with your father should determine how you should react, I would joke it off, like dad if you don't erase that picture mom's going to kill you or you can just sit and directly ask him what;s going on.... Good Luck I wish u the best, My father and me are every close so I would be able to use both way's|`|RUkf4ND0aa	yeah; as gross as it seems, some people like to look at naked girls. but i think no matter how akward it may be, you should confront him because maybe it was saved as an accident. we all know how parents cnt really figure out technology... so this could be a misunderstanding. worst comes to worst, he and you get embarrassed. good luck
35770bf8f2d8c67783b3ab4e50bf146caa	I hate six packs, for one. I think that men with pecs just look like they have boobs...<br>  <br>  And it's true that guys who are heavier can have boobs too, but they're not so.. defined.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend looks like the second one.. maybe not quite as big, actually. But I love him for him, and I'd rather have a teddybear to hug than a washboard.|`|379535241206594addf37d46a8066addaa	Personally I go for a guy's personality rather than looks. I care  if I click with the guy more than anything else. So... If the girl's smart, she won't care about your flabby stomach, but rather she'll try to get to know you. So just go ahead and try asking her out/talking with her. What's the worse that can happen? I mean, if she does say no, I think you'll still be alive and well and in time you'll find a girl that likes you the way you are. Be confident and don't let a girl define how you feel about your body.|`|12c4e9a14460db6a2bbea351bc7f2b62aa	awww, you are so sweet, i dont thing stomach matters. the important thing is they should like you the way you are. you should also know how to carry youself, and never show insecurity, because that's the one that will bring you down. just be yourself and talk to her and be friendly. then if you think she also likes you, then ask her. don't expect for the time mean because if you expect good ones and bad comes out, it will only hurt your feelings.. good luck.. and most of girls like it when guys make them laugh..:) goodluck..<br>  <br>  p.s.<br>  if we are talking about health here, then maybe you should start keeping in shape, not for your lovelife but also for your life.. get me??|`|crbzVL0Haa	The first guy is WAY too muscular. <br>  <br>  No comfort for cuddling D: <br>  <br>  If you're a funny, nice guy, I wouldn't worry about it. Go for it! You have nothing to lose. <br>  <br>  Sexual attraction is important, but the person's personality is SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend is 3 inches shorter than me, but there's no one else I'd rather spend my free time with. We have sooo much fun.<br>  <br>  I'll say it again, GO FOR IT. You'll regret it later if you don't.|`|xpZoXcF6aa	lol...but me personally o like my men big, not like supa fat but i guess u can say thick,i have always dated "big guys" jus as long as they were big and tall, not big and short, but it shouldn't matter what size a person is because looks change ,if she's skinny there's no grauntee that she'll be skinny the rest of her life, so if she doesn't except you for who u are mentally and physically, then she not the one for you<br>  Sincerely,<br>  *Dr. Diva*|`|n0rJH0l6aa	Eurghhh muscles make me feel ill! I like thin, but not like ribs thin. Although I wouldn't be turned off by someone who was a little chubby like that, but I would be turned off by the muscles.<br>  <br>  Plus if I liked a guys personality I wouldn't give a hoot if they were chubby or skinny or muscley or even wrinkly. (Well, maybe wrinkly, since that would be weird as i'm 17)|`|iMrKo8cSaa	Honestly, both are gross---- the first one spells self centered and high maintenence, the second spells "i don't care"<br>  <br>  But as long as you have a nice personality, no one will care. I've gone out with some butt ugly guys who has amazing personalities and they were so sweet.|`|R05nC096aa	i wouldn't take the first one or the second one i like someone in between that has stomach but isn't to fat and some one who has muscles but not Too much because guys that have muscles like that scare me but i would totally go for you if you had a nice personality.|`|MNDvP3rxaa	everybody likes something different, if she is shallow enough to not like you because you have a bit of chunk then she is not worth it and you should move on, but if you really like her and the shallowness doesnt matter, then do some crunchies.|`|MGfFDZnLaa	uhh no offense, but do you think that the girl you like would be that shallow as to not like you because of your STOMACH?<br>  <br>  if you're really that bothered by that, just go join a sport or start doing sit ups and excercising or something.|`|NqUgoRUQaa	I like the first one better. But it really doesnt matter then are some guys that are'nt to good looking but it makes them hot if there funny and can make me laugh. If that girl says no becuase of your stomach you dont need her.|`|DIZ0dFxraa	is she proportional to you? if not, you need to work harder to talk to her. most women can be persuaded past what they see. dont lose hope, just work harder to get to know her.|`|XeSRh52Waa	of course girls like the 1st one. but we don't normally judge who we're gonna date on a guys stomach...|`|bwoVogaOaa	the First!<br>  but if you say you are funny, nice and that you would take care of her then ask her out1<br>  GOOD LUCK! :)|`|QL12LD5daa	MMM...<br>  <br>  THE FiRST ONE!!<br>  <br>  SORRy<br>  <br>  BUT i BET SHE'LL UNDERSTAND<br>  <br>  iS WATS iNSiDE THE COUNTS!!<br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  <33|`|N8cAwzxzaa	Obviously, the first, but you knew that. It's not your stomach that matters though. It's your personality.|`|Fulmgnmsaa	The first one is pritty cute but as long as your stomach isnt like falling out over your pants you are probbably good to go.|`|855b1a5e80e9f7956bb871ec16511c7faa	They probably say you could protect her by using your amazing stomach fat. Oh and the first one if I had to choose.|`|IjTXOTzvaa	of course the 1st one|`|h3Nw5JLmaa	If your funny and a nice guy it should not matter what your stomach looks like.|`|ODblt2gTaa	no thanks|`|wSjqllhPaa	the first|`|2iXuzHgwaa	I dont mean this to be mean but I like the first one.<br>  I hate flabby stomachs.<br>  Sorry!|`|rswiEosSaa	I'm not just an abs girl. I take the whole package (lol) into account. Sometimes guys with so many muscles and 8 pack abs are trying to compensate for something else. You know what I mean...lol|`|m8BJXUKwaa	ew neither|`|B16oJAfxaa	i would definately like the 1st one better, but it wouldn't have to be THAT toned. but at least let it be flat, but the 6 pack wouldnt hurt=]|`|oFjQAWA5aa	well for me personally i would not like the first one, i certainly can't stand guys who's muscles are far too big like that it makes me wanna be sick! seriously it's disgusting, that's just my preference! I think any decent girl worth your time is not gonna care too much right, if she does she really truly is not worth your time o.k!<br>  <br>  If you're a decent sweet funny lovely guy who will treat her well and won't disrespect her or treat her bad then that is all that should matter, so don't panic go for it. If she rejects you because of that then she's really just not worth your time & attention boy!|`|2oXy22pvaa	well.. truthfully the first is preferred.<br>  <br>  I personally don't mind guys who are slightly chubby.. but if you are really like the second... well some girls will accept it, but unfortunately most people are sort of shallow and probably wouldn't. Is there any way at all you could get rid of the extra? Because I think by doing that, you would better your chances. Seriously, it really just depends on the girl.|`|00A3BfSEaa	who cares about your stomach just ask her out you never know just ask her.|`|oKRbe6XYaa	Well give urself confidence, you have to try it to believe it right?? But honestly I prefer the first one cus that's what every women want, a good shape guy right? Well, you can get in a little shape, like end the burger meal & go for some subway. But I'm just trying to help, not meaning to offend you. Get into more physical activities, maybe?(*_*)|`|fC8OPOTkaa	out of the two, i'd say the first one but if i had to say out of any i'd like a guy to be a little less muscly than the first one.<br>  <br>  :) X|`|YG8J5xA5aa	I think the first one id far too much.<br>  I'd say inbetween. but i wouldnt care about a slightly flabby stomach and anyone who does is just shallow|`|8ZUVToXgaa	lol why is this for girls only?<br>  <br>  I say the first one is more attractive, but if I was in love with the guy it wouldn't matter as much.<br>  <br>  Go for her!|`|KGOxYkh7aa	well without knowing a person i would say the first. <br>  but right now i like a cute guy with the second,so it is possible.<br>  i hope it works out:] just make her know you.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Look at it this way, you won't get a complete BlTCH.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	i didn't look at your pics but let me tell you, most girls do not like overly buff guys meaning don't go overboard but look healthy and strong.|`|d4c9a4d52a9e77de4545721ac937c02faa	definitely the first one|`|57af3cd106168b01009e4dbbc6d55acbaa	I prefer a fit man but there are a lot of women whom like fat boys (:|`|mdE1HXMkaa	Nice guys always lose.

While women do like a good looking man, what they really like is a good personality.  If it comes in an average or better body, that's nice. But not necessary.<br>  <br>  And not that many women these days are interested in having a man "take care of them".  Most are well able to take care of themselves.<br>  <br>  What women REALLY like is a confident man. Not agressive or pushy, and not "nice" as in a wimp. They like a guy who knows who he is and what he wants.|`|HBbNtDpfaa	If she is half decent she would like you for your personality and like the fact you are funny and be pleased you would take care of her, it's pretty shallow if she didn't care about that and was just bothered about the way you look!|`|vg1WARiIaa	um....interesting question.... rofl<br>  <br>  if you put it in that much of a black and white picture then of course i pick the 1st one...but personally i dont care about looks as much as i care about personality.<br>  <br>  =l <br>  <br>  hope i helped?|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	So what. If that girl doesn't like you because of your stomach, that mean she is shallow. She is focusing on physical attraction than both mental.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I would like the first one.|`|kJDYvqaOaa	I'd go with the second.

CprHRUgHaa	Obviously, no offense but being that he can't get anyone his own age, he's just trying to get some. Is he even cute? If he's not then he's just using his age to his advantage. Find someone your own age hun, if this guy isn't interested in introducing you his friends chances are he's somewhat embarrassed of the situation. Take care and love yourself!|`|7GFNKvDXaa	No, he obviously likes you. <br>  <br>  Please answer mine - <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222143006AAx3Mx9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|xarKlp0Oaa	He may be using you but you won't know unless you go out with him. If things are going well when you are with him, talk to him and ask him what's the worst that can happen.|`|I8SjPyeBaa	He truly likes you.

He is three years older than you, hon.  I'm also in eighth grade, by the way.  Think about yourself three years ago, when you were a fifth grader.  The differences from then to now is how different you and this junior are.  No matter how much he likes you, this is not going to work, as teenagers difference in age is a big deal because everyone knows teens are practically a different person every six months, it's just how we grow up and become who we're going to be.  Would you date a 5th grade boy?  I know girls are more mature than boys, but they are also really silly when they are too flattered to use their brains.  Pleease please don't let this guy mess around.  Also if he's told you not to tell anyone about you two, then he is ashamed of being with you, and that SUCKS.  He is being really immature.  You can't base a relationship out of shame, and he is going to be ready for things you shouldn't be doing at your age.

It makes people feel emotional and calming.|`|J9sUlpX8aa	Well why is Hulk Hogan in the WWE and not any other similar wrestling federation?<br>  <br>  Because if he went anywhere else, it wouldn't be the GREATEST show in sports entertainment, that's why!<br>  <br>  so why is red the colour of red? I think I already answered that.
4POGapREaa	You didn't do anything wrong but please leave it at the apology message & don't say anymore about it.  Let them work through their issues.  You are not responsible for that argument.  If you had said something SO ridiculous & off the mark, they would have laughed at you.  That didn't happen.  They know that what you pointed out is an issue in their relationship & they can't blame other people for simply noticing that small fact.  If your comment caused them to argue, I'm sure it's not something that hasn't happened repeatedly behind closed doors anyway.  You apologized for getting in the mix & that's good enough.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	honey, if you didnt point that out, SOMEONE would have eventually.  you didnt start that argument, they did.|`|cd962e52b53659b6dacb1df7cbdf7a87aa	you did the right thing.  he is abusive and you supported her.  she needs to get rid of him and her brother should tell her that.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	You didn't cause any damage, this problem exists whether you noticed it or not. This is their problem, not yours.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	you just pointed out a problem that they were both fully aware of before.<br>  You didn't do anything wrong don't worry.  All you did was embarrass him and might I say, GOOD! Maybe embarrassing him like that will smack some sense in his thick skull!|`|OLXv3DEAaa	It sounds like it could be a serious argument but honestly it seems like an argument they maybe needed to have. He seems to belittle her and he feels like she belittles him, etc. This kind of thing only gets worse and worse the longer people are together, unless they deal with it and figure out a better way to treat each other and communicate. <br>  <br>  I would not worry about it, since your friend is not mad and honestly IMO he deserved it, and sounds like he has issues anway.|`|AA11924851	It sounds like your boyfriends sister is a horrible man himself! Anyone who would tell their girlfriend to shh and stop talking about something is very selfish. If you did indeed break things up for them, it sounds like its for the best and that you have saved her from living the rest of her life in hell. Maybe she had felt the same way too but didnt want to end things because she felt that he would be angry and aggressive? Either way i think you did the right thing. Its when people are silent that things continue and eventually worsen!|`|R8HWkcoMaa	I wouldnt worry too much.  If they felt that way anyway then it was going to happen eventually.<br>  <br>  It is not damage that you have caused it was issues that they already had which you just happened to bring out into the open.<br>  <br>  If she is as good a friend as you say she is then she will not hold this against you as you were just trying to be supportive towards her.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Pea face facts and reality.Stop making excuses and see things without the rose tinted glasses.You had a minor tiff with romeo and he regressed into his former self.So you fall for that old line "I've been hurt so much in the past etc etc".

You'll be one of his past disappointments and hurt.

If you still really love him, don't let your relationship go out the window.  You should talk things over with your mom.  I understand she's upset, but maybe a sincere conversation will  get her to calm down.  You should tell her how you really feel, and apologize for doing things she didn't approve of.  She shouldn't blame anything on just him, (although that's what mothers usually do).  That's about all I can say, your in such a tough situation.

I really like it here, housing can be expensive, but with the economic situation maybe you'll find something cheap.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  I came to visit and found a local, who partnered with me to open a business here.  You can also open a business without a partner, not sure how much money you need.  When you open a business or you purchase a freezone property, you also get residency status, for 99 years.  Check it out on <br>  line, there is alot of information.  Also originally I am from Canada, if you are looking to head towards the US, why not look at Canada too?  Canada is a beautiful place and Toronto is known for its "melting pot", whereby there are so many different cultures in one area, they all melt together, its really interesting.  I prefer Canada over the USA, but I prefer Dubai over both places, if you like the sunshine, you can't beat the weather here!|`|DE1pTaBFaa	1. the best place would be Hawaii but if you don't like volcanoes than don't move there <br>  <br>  2. the second best place would be Florida but if your scared of hurricanes and tornadoes than don't do that <br>  <br>  3. i would say california and since california is big and has water and beaches i would say live in San Diego not LA in La there are always people trying to hustle|`|u9H8lhRuaa	where do you live now?if you are planning on having kids i would recommend Omaha,NE

As you mentioned you do not want to loose her friendship, so put that first. However, be subtle and let her come to know you think she's great ect. She may come to the conclusion herself. Don't panic though, you never know what might happen. And eventually, after school it may all work out. I hope this helps....:)|`|kIpDDVc9aa	Stay close friends and reach the time when the both of you finish school. You never know what happens. If you were meant to be, then it will happen.

BLaEQfdDaa	depending on your state you could live on your own, you can pick which parent want to live with, The courts will even look at when you turn 18, and how much school you have left are you planning to college, the courts will decide who and how its split up to pay for your college funds.|`|mcUSz16kaa	The Emancipation in Colorado is 19.  However, you have the right to ask for emancipation from the judge to grant you authority.  Meanwhile, do yourself a favor by saving your money by staying home until you graduate.  It's a pretty expensive world out here.|`|lb8FBhWnaa	What rights would you want?
2KUdefSBaa	Go for it!<br>  You are an incredible person. Don't be handcuffed by our mindless social stigmas. A woman has every right to tell her man how she feels and what she wants. Its a sign of confidence, strength, intelligence, maturity and everything else it takes to be successful in life.<br>  <br>  Please do NOT do the total seduction thing.  Just ask him out somewhere quiet.  Pick a shared interest (other than sex) and favored private location. e.g  your favorite mountan top, beach, forest, horse back riding, bike riding, etc. ...<br>  <br>  Be prepared for him to say no or not be prepared to answer.  If he's not prepared to answer yet state a time frame to meet again and discuss it. <br>  <br>  Keep sex out of this as sex is irrelevant to a long lasting happy marriage.  Also  sex really confuses things in that he has to respond from a non-sexual basis. Men confuse love and sex so keep them totally separate.  God has already figured the sex part out for you. Focus on the other aspects.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Lifelong Happiness:)<br>  <br>  Nikki is right in that good sex helps.  But she's only 23 years old while I have been married for ... much longer than that...so it depends if you are in it for the long haul or not.  Nicki does have point but in the long run other things are more important.. ....|`|pMsMx817aa	i thought you were already getting married in october?<br>  <br>  ella<br>  <br>  edit - oh okay, i wasnt trying to be rude or nothing<br>  honestly, i think you should wait til he does it.  he'll do it when hes absolutely ready, if you ask him you mght make him feel pressured.  the wedding day is the girls day basically while the proposal is the guys.  <br>  <br>  if you really really insist on doing it, just ask him.  "hey baby,  i love you.  will you marry me?" plain and simple.  <br>  <br>  good luck<br>  ella|`|3NQizLOKaa	ok good luck have fun|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Sorry, but you shouldn't propose. ALL my guy friends say they wouldn't want a woman to propose to them. If he is ready he will ask you to marry him, if he's not asking, he's not ready. If you feel like you must propose to him then just do it the way the guys do it. Tell him you love him and you want to spend the rest of your life with him and ask him to marry you, but as I said... the guy should be the one doing it, not the girl.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	1. cook a nice dinner and ask him then. Simple and sweet.<br>  2. Paul is wrong, sex has a LOT to do with a long happy marriage.  It is a BIG part of marriage.  If the sex isn't good your marriage will not actually be that happy.<br>  3. Ignore the people that say "let him propose". A man does not always have to be the one to ask. It's ridiculous to think that.  You are right, if he loves you then he won't care.|`|wYLWBufWaa	take him out to dinner than propose to him good luck|`|6HgiNCmqaa	he should purpose to u|`|8159805006b5dedc78985dc1f9770ce2aa	My first question is are you over 18?<br>  <br>  Next, my advice would to be not to propose to him. Drop hints, like every woman does. With the seasons changing and the warmer months coming it's going to be wedding season soon, so wedding stuff will be everywhere. If you're watching tv and happen to come across a wedding type show, stop and watch. Tell him the things you like and ask his opinion. If you're shopping at the mall and pass a jewelry store, mention how exciting it is to get an engagement ring. Eventually he should take the hint and if he's ready for it, he'll make the deciison to propose. You don't want to rush into anything too fast. Good luck though!|`|6A13JKenaa	you take him into the bedroom<br>  get him naked<br>  do him some favors<br>  pop a ring on him|`|bDWDZ63Iaa	ITs not the traditional way, but if that makes you happy then go for it.|`|ds1rf8efaa	the BOY is supposed to propose silly!|`|UuSmemr7aa	You Shouldn't Let Him Think It Over, And Talk To Him About It, He Might Not Be Ready|`|4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	Your question is how do I go about doing this.  My answer is...you don't.<br>  <br>  Sorry, good luck though!|`|UAF8Zxzaaa	Are you sure you want to propose? I've always had a bad feeling about when a couple breaks up many times. It usually means that a couple will break up at the drop of a hat, and that doesn't work well in marriage. If you have been boyfriend girlfriend again for a while, then maybe it isn't something to worry about. Just the rule of thumb for me has always been to be in a relationship without breaking up for a certain amount of time before considering marriage. <br>  <br>  But if that's all well and working... Then there's no reason not to propose. Does he want a ring? I proposed to my fiance, and got him a Claddagh ring (the one with the heart, crown, and hands) because he loves Ireland and that ring. I proposed to him over the phone, and then proposed in person, and then he got me a ring and proposed back to me, hahha. So whatever floats your boat is fine! Just make it romantic for you both.|`|ckJP6TTQaa	First, your birthdays have nothing to do with your ability to create a marriage together. <br>  <br>  Second, find out if he feels the same way. Talk to him about the future, ask him whether he is thinking about marriage and what he sees in store for the two of you. If he says "I don't know" then he's not ready. If he tells you all about his hopes and dreams for the two of you, then he might be. <br>  <br>  After you know that he is ready, propose to him in any way you want. It can be casual and sweet, or it can be elaborate and exciting. It really depends on your personalities, your likes and interests, etc. Propose to him in a way that makes him think, "That is SO you -- and I love you."
L69jZMXQaa	well i'd do some research and make sure he's not cheating first|`|4d7f164df9b799e88fffba204ae0183faa	Signs are if he cares more about his looks lately, buying a lot of new clothes, got a new hair cut, etc., or if he is suddenly listening to a new type of music, or likes a new TV show, etc., it could be because the new girl turned him on to that, if he is extra nice to you, it's because he's feeling guilty, etc.|`|5YEKmHqyaa	Honestly I've never heard of anything called winter depression?  I don't even thing that is a real condition.  Even if he was depressed there would still be ways of getting in contact with him.  Honestly to be frank, I think he is doing something behind your back..but you def need more proof.  Depression is depression and it doesnt just cut off in the spring  and summer time then hit back once winter starts.<br>  <br>  Unless he's lost a family member or some other tragic event has happened around winter time that is the only thing i can come up with.  Like i said, do some more investigating, but if he's really in depression.  He can't just cut that on and off whenever he feels like it.|`|hwKFm7H8aa	winter depression? wtf is that?|`|d16sM2iOaa	It's a great thing you want to help. The distance in the relationship at times like this aren't good. Tell him you want to be there for him and at times like this(when he's depressed) that's when you should be there for him. If you think he might be cheating or something you just need to be honest wtih him. Tell him how it looks. But try to spend more time with him more than anything.<br>  <br>  Talk to him about this. It's the most important thing.|`|AA11841294	winter depression huh? that's a new one... um lets see... well if it was me i would follow  him. after a date, when he drops me off i would get in my car ( if u drive) and follow him every where he go.... but first call him tell him ur in the house ok and find out where he is. in other words question him none stop!!!!

Tell him to call you when he's feeling depressed. That would be your opportunity to cheer him up.  If that doesn't work, let him know that you think he is cheating.|`|RUD2N3Sqaa	iam really not sure ,wat u wrote bout his behaviour does have some symptoms of cheating but not enough to convince me , so i dont think hes cheating u can realx , but on the other hand he could be u never kno, i suggest u sit down with him and talk bout this thoroughly as soon as possible so u can relax ok goodluck|`|r1Io25gsaa	all the stuff he doing is pointing out that he is cheating..not that he is in winter depression|`|ds1rf8efaa	give him the b.o.d.|`|ERWiypdYaa	if hes not calling you or taking the time to b with u then hes just not that into you.|`|AA11289793	Well I dunno maybe you should like be more nosey on his phone and stuff, and ask his exes and stuff why they broke up.

p1ISqovraa	Wow.  That's super freaky.  Be nice to this guy, because you never know if he's crazy.  But def don't lead him on in ANY WAY POSSIBLE.

dv0zbH7gaa	... weirdo|`|4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	Your lack of self confidence and jealousy will sabotage a lot of different situations in your life if you let it.  You obviously know and realize the problem.  Perhaps counseling will help.  I don' t know but I do know I have been in your shoes and being jealous isn't worth it.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	its tough, I have been through alot of relationships, some better than others, but each one you learn to control what you do wrong, and you learn to look for things that you dont like, but right from the start have to be honest with each other, open about things let each other know what your likes and dislikes, the old saying is I know what buttons to push to get things started. try to avoid that, you will love again but learn to love smarter, but if you dont learn anything from past relationships you will just keep making the mistakes or wont learn to control you feelings to where they drive you crzy and your partner crazy in wanting to leave. you have to learn to be happy with yourself before you can make anyone else happy!!!|`|kYXVb8AZaa	try bringing your self confidence up a little, and if you need some help, then seek a good therapist. try looking in the mirror each day and finding something that you like about yourself. do this each day and eventually you will automatically just feel it. insecurity is a big contributor to jealousy. Also look for someone who has self confidence in themselves. Not someone who is completely stuck on themselve or arrogant, but someone who isn't insecure wont be as likely to accuse you of cheating.
nvowgvtzaa	Ignore him. Like hard core, don't talk to him, look at him, etc. If you cut him out of your life, you'll learn to live without him.|`|iZgtcAcAaa	get out and meet other people - let him go, as it's obvious he doesn't have feelings for you anymore|`|tbKoPNbDaa	im in the EXACT same situation as you right now except we broke up 5 months ago. he is over me and im still madly in love with him. just try to meet another guy dont date though until your ready just go out and have fun with a fun guy and try to cut off contact with your ex. it will be really hard at first but time will heal you i promise. best of luck :)|`|UWx1beYtaa	It took me 5 years to get over an ex.

Put yourself in new places. Meet new people.

It sucks, but it's for the better in the end.|`|Z1nBkxmraa	You have to start trying to look at other guys if he is hurting you as much as you say he was then its wrong.

1HTRWrawaa	We have a habit of ignoring a person's faults until we agree to marry them. As the wedding day gets closer, we start seeing the person and all his faults and ask our self, "Do I really want to spend the rest of my life putting up with all this man's faults?" <br>  <br>  About 2 weeks before my wedding day, I wanted to call off the wedding. But all the wedding plans were done and the invitations sent out. How could I call off the wedding now? I told myself I just had cold feet and I went ahead with the wedding. Big mistake!!! Two years later and now with a baby, I divorced him. All my fears about him and what marriage would be like with him, all came true.<br>  <br>  When you marry someone, you have to believe with all your heart that he is the man you want to spend the rest of your life with. Just because you love him, doesn't mean that you are meant to be together for life.<br>  <br>  Call off the wedding. Tell your boyfriend that you love him, but you just aren't ready to make a lifetime commitment at this time.<br>  <br>  Yes he will be hurt and maybe angry, but you will be making a big mistake marrying someone you feel that if you had it all over to do again, you wouldn't marry him. If he's not the right man for you, then you need to move on and find someone else.<br>  <br>   I think it would be hard for him to continue being just friends, while you date other men. It would be a mistake also for you to continue dating him after you cancel the wedding. Don't put your life and your future on hold like that because you love him. As you said, you love him, but he's not right for you. Make a clean break. It's the best thing for the both of you.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	If you're not sure that you want to be married to the guy then it is time that the two of you sit down and talk about this. If you don't then you could end up being married and having children and then later on in life you could end up being sorry and staying miserable for life. You could also end up divorced.|`|1gF9QVy9aa	I was in your position five years ago.....<br>  <br>  My wedding was also in May and my cold feet came in January....<br>  <br>  My parents also gave me "the talk" because the deposits are non-refundable....<br>  <br>  I went through with it......and my husband never changed.  I have loved him less and less each year because I've realized that we really don't mesh and our expectations of each other are very different.....<br>  <br>  I resent my husband although it was my idea to move forward with the wedding.....<br>  <br>  We are now heading for a separation.  <br>  <br>  CALL OFF YOUR WEDDING.  <br>  <br>  If I could go back..........I would.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	Oh my, you sound like me 3 months ago.  My feet got so cold I called the whole thing off.  I was so stressed about it I couldn't eat, sleep or concentrate on anything else.  I allowed all of my fears and 'what if's' to creep in and completely take over my thoughts.  When you worry like this, you forget about the gem you have right in front of you who wants to marry you.<br>  <br>  It's perfectly healthy to ask yourself questions.  However, if you have grave doubts about the relationship working, it is always better to call things off until you get your head straight.  I called my wedding off, but went ahead with it a month or so later (only a small family wedding) and I'm really glad that I got married.<br>  <br>  Remember also, nobody is perfect and you love him, you have to work out for yourself whether it's worth losing him over the things that bother you.  Best wishes|`|6en8QlaUaa	There's nothing wrong with postponing your wedding.<br>  <br>  Marriage is not something to be taken lightly. It is designed to be a lifetime commitment to someone.<br>  <br>  If this is the man that you are meant to be with then it doesn't matter if you postpone the wedding for a while. If he is right for you, he will always be right for you.<br>  <br>  My Mother gave me some advice that has protected me on countless occasions. "Never second guess your first instinct"<br>  If you don't believe that this man is right for you then he probably isn't...<br>  If you believe you need to postpone your wedding then postpone it.<br>  <br>  If he loves you then he will understand.<br>  DO NOT be pressured into marraige.<br>  Do it if it feels right to you.<br>  <br>  I have been married twice, the first time I knew in my heart that it wasn't right but felt pressured because I had told everyone I was getting married. <br>  I felt like I wanted to postpone it just to be sure but did it anyway and it ended in divorce, less than 2 years later.<br>  <br>  My second marriage felt right. It felt like it was supposed to be. I KNEW that it was the right thing to do.<br>  <br>  I am happily married now.|`|AA11415946	If you are having any doubts I would postpone it for now.  Obviously your head is taking over.  <br>  <br>  "I love him but I KNOW  he is not the ideal man I would pick if I had to do it over again."  These are your words.  <br>  <br>  If he has "baggage, irresponsible, not as intelligent as I would like".  These are the three things you have named.  I assume that these are the things that bother you the most and are a source of irritation to you.  These are things that can lead to divorce.  Why put yourself through all of that when it is so much simpler not to go there in the first place.  It's like saying, "Gee I know that iron is freakin' hot as hell but what the hey I'm gonna put my hand on the hot iron and burn the crap out of my hand because the iron has been there for four years, it is still an iron and if I burn my hand..."  Now, has the iron changed because you burned your hand on it or is it still a hot iron?<br>  <br>  Am I making any sense to yah?|`|e6ffe3bb85dbb18771be535b5930f9a0aa	I know you love him but what about in-love?  <br>  <br>  It doesn't make him less of a good person with baggage...but if hes irresponsible and lacking intelligence...then maybe you should reconsider.  Are you certain that it is only now that you are having 'negative' thoughts about your relationship?  If you 2 have dated for 4 years and you have never had a negative thought, then maybe its just the scary thought of commitment...or it could be that you are just a passive person that now realizes once you 2 are married, you cannot go anywhere (unlike now, if you have doubts/arguments, you can easily leave with no paperwork.)<br>  <br>  If I were in your shoes, I would postpone the wedding until I felt comfortable.  Apologize to everyone if needed, and explain this to your fiance...that you're having 2nd thoughts.  If he truly loves you, he will understand (be sad of course) but you 2 can surely work it out|`|fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	Your first responsibility is to yourself. You need to take good care of you. Forget the 8 days, forget all the deadlines. You are important. Even if the deposit is made, you are more important than money. <br>  <br>  Assume he won't change. That's the most reasonable assumption. After marriage, things don't get better, they stay the same or get worse. Imagine for a moment, if you are married to him, would you be happy? Are you doing yourself good by marrying him? <br>  <br>  I'd say, if you're not sure it the right decision it is probably not the riht decision.<br>  <br>  You should postpone the wedding and give him the reasons why are you doing so. This will be the signal to him to eitehr shape up or ship out. Keep in mind that he might just ship out. You have no control over his reaction. I know making this kind of decision sounds like a nightmare now, but it would be much worse if you were to get married and then a few years later, after torturing yourself some more, still getting a divorce.|`|QODJNf1oaa	I would advise you not to get married since you are having second thoughts. Just think, once you tie the knott and begin living together all of your negative thoughts about him will only get worse. To be able to tell if he is really the man for you, it sounds like you need to have some time to yourself to think about what you really want. And if he truely loves you the way he says, then he will be there for you if you decide that you do want to marry him. If not, then you were right in your thinking.|`|UUrqECXIaa	If you are having such serious doubts, you should post-pone the wedding. If you were meant to be together you will be. But if you do post-pone the wedding, you need to be prepared for the idea that he may not want to continue the relationship-it would be a huge hurt for him to have to get over, unless he is having these doubts too.|`|rGci1ehoaa	Talk to your fiance... tell him you are not sure of you two should get married yet.... you are lucky you have realized this BEFORE the wedding and not after!!! people change after marriage.. i know i did!!! Talk to him about the things he can change and see if he is willing to change for you or at least see how he reacts.. if he is defensive then i would just cancel the wedding and move on there are plenty of fish in the sea.. dont settle for someone you dont think is ideal|`|6Apou72oaa	If I were you I would get out now.  It's a lot easier before you're married then after.  Don't settle for him just because you think you don't deserve any better.  If he hasn't changed in the last 4 years, he's not about to change after you get married, and if he does, it might be for worse, not better.  He'll just take you even more for granted.|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	You know,,,,,I'd say it depend on your age!  Ya, see.....the pickens get fewer the older you get!  And you need to figure out if this is a man you'd be proud of to be the father of your children.  See, because, you might find another man, but a good, attentive, financially responsible father for your children, that type of man is rare!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|earvvNhvaa	Well if you really loved him then you wouldn't have second thoughts! I think that if you date him still after you put off your own wedding you will make your emotions go all whack. There is a saying called "Being away from your love makes the heart grow fonder"... or something like that.|`|bMk6xZaSaa	Ah Sweetheart!!! Don't ask people on yahoo answers about a decision like this!  Go find someone you know really well and trust, or someone you know you could trust like a pastor or priest and ask them about it.  Those people are trained to help you become happy. We're just mere people with our own agenda's and opinions.  <br>  <br>  Love him. Love yourself. Find out what's best. Don't ask us.|`|CQsD09D6aa	Of course you can cancel the wedding. In fact you SHOULD if you are having doubts. Be as honest as possible with you fiance and let him know that you would like to work on the relationship. Try to persuade him to go to couple's therapy. Good luck!|`|4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	If you are having second thoughts then don't do it.  That's pretty much all I can say.  You won't all of a sudden become happy after marriage.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11208683	well your never going to really find that perfect man. i would talk to him about it....maybe he is feeling the same way. if you have been together for 4 years than i think you know him as much as you can. you can always cancel the wedding for now or just see if you can get it for a later date. think some more about it and then make your decision. everyone gets cold feet before they get married...its normal. I did pretty bad and my dad told me that he was glad i got cold feet becuase it shows that you are really thinking about this. it shows that you care and that you don't want to rush into things. if you two love each other you will grow and eventually he will grow out of the irresponsibility. but the baggage your going to get from a lot of people your with everyone has a past. and the intelligence shouldn't matter unless he can't do anything.... you should love him for him no matter what. GOOD LUCK. and make the right decision for you and only you!!! its your life no one elses.|`|Ncad6d57aa	Look, what I'm about to tell you is very important.. seriously. You may think that losing a bunch of money from the wedding seems like a big deal, right? WRONG. Destroying your life by getting dvorced, fighting for custody, is a wayyy bigger deal than a couple thousand dollars spent on a wedding that wont happen. It's a lot easier to get married than it is to get divorced. If you can't deal with his baggage, etc DO NOT GET MARRIED. This is the person you will have to wake up next to every morning for the rest of your life. Even if it's little crap that bothers you, if you can't stand it, don't marry him. And this isn't just a case of cold feet, you are genuinely concerned about how can I deal with this guy, don't do it.|`|UR5GfThJaa	Well if you love him then the best thing to do would be to talk to him about it. I know that when I get worried about things between my boyfriend and I, I talk to him and he always makes me feel better.|`|aSE7sihFaa	Postpone the wedding and give yourself sometime to think it over. This is a lifelong commitment that you are promising to make to the other person. Its much easier to break off an engagement than to get a divorce. Be honest and just let him know that now is not the right time for you and you need some time to think about whether this is really the right decision. There's no rush. Also, fyi...men do not change what you see from day one is what you get. Think about whether you are able to truly tolerate these things for the rest of your life. Granted, no one is perfect but in my opinion a man should meet atleast 85-90% of your wants/needs. Either way do not go through with the wedding right now.|`|aeLyiRczaa	I would say that neither of you is what they other should hope for.  He may not be a prize winner, but you were not wise enough to let these things bother you until you now this close to the wedding?<br>  <br>  If you end it, of course you will regret it.  For how long, no one knows.  I do know that it is worse to be married and come to the conclusion you made a mistake then to call if off now.<br>  <br>  Hey, he may be the ideal guy for you and you are not wise enough to know it.  He may be the worst guy for you and you avoided a train wreck.   You have to make that call on your own.<br>  <br>  As to seeing him.  Well, it is not likely he will be okay with that.  But then he may be and if you tell him the things that made you call it off, he might change these things.<br>  <br>  Life is a gamble each day.  Make sure you are willing to take the risks and pay the price for the decisions you make.  I would only suggest that you not agree to marry someone in the first place until you are comfortable with who and how they are.  Otherwise, you have done them a disservice as well.  But I do commend you for being gutsy enough to decide to call it off instead of going through with it because of pressure.|`|mE48VMXiaa	Well, that's pretty tough... if you marry him with these doubts, you may always wonder what you missed out on; don't just "settle", that will cause problems eventually anyway. <br>  <br>  You should always want whats best for yourself and love and support your spouse to do the best for himself too.  If you don't feel he meets your expectations, it is unfair to expect or want him to change; either you love him unconditionally for the person he is, or you don't and that probably won't change.  Your friends and family are usually good judges of whether a person is right for you, do they honestly think he's the right guy for you? <br>  <br>  The "total package" is never flawless either; there's always going to be something and it may not surface until later on, but if you love him unconditionally, you can overlook those little things.|`|tqA9kxeqaa	i think if its gotten that bad and your are second guessing yourself so much, then i think you shouldn't go through with it...<br>  <br>  second, are you religious?  because if you are, I suggest you pray about it.<br>  if not, well then I can't offer you any other advice than to call it off.<br>  <br>  oh and BTW, there is not a perfect man out there, and if anyone thinks otherwise, they are probably not married yet.<br>  marriage usually lets it all come out. but if you are a chrisitian, then you can work on your marriage through prayer.|`|yB54t7ZFaa	I think the best thing to do right now is cancel the wedding. He sounds like he does not want to change and marring him would tell him its ok to stay the same way he is now. You love him yes but take the time to make sure this is the right choice for you. If he loves you he should understand and you two can still be together. Dont waste money on it yet the timing is just not right. Good luck to you and I wish the best to the both of you!|`|4a3240c13f7f2fd3e4ad92aafe2eb7b5aa	Don't do it.  Your gut feeling is always right.  Life is too short to be miserable and you will find the right person.  I know it's difficult to just break up after being in a serious relationship for a long time, but better now than getting divorced one day and putting your potential children through that trauma.|`|LssMoEwQaa	I may only be 13 and have never been married, but i have heard stories of people who have gotten nervous before the wedding. If your gut is really telling you to back out, then you should. But just think before you make a decision. You would not want to do anything you might regret.|`|NdZIPNwhaa	don't change ur mind if ur truly love him i mean if he loves u and cares about u stay with him why would u want to change ur mind .|`|jJwlN2pbaa	please don't do it at least your gut told you so because you will get a big regard for it.|`|AA10465474	It's better to do it now, then 5 years down the road when you have brought a child into the world. Now you have to deal with explaining to your child why you and daddy aren't together any more. Trust me, I am on my second marriage because I didn't have the guts to say no when they asked. I thought, well they asked, it must mean something, so I said yes and both times it has been the worst decision I have made. I am getting ready to leave my second husband and we have a 5 year old that's involved. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying don't go through with it, he might be the perfect person for you. But if you are having cold feet, really sit down and ask yourself, am I doing it because I love him, or because he asked and I owe it to him? Remember you don't owe him the rest of your life if you won't be happy. Your happiness needs to come first, because if you're not happy, he won't be either.|`|CMrkxNmcaa	Just stop, throw every logical thought away, and just think to yourself, can you see yourself living without him in 5 years? if the answer is no then you clearly made the right decision. if you really love the person then you should be with them no matter what, even if when you think about it they may have problems, but nobody's perfect, and theres a reason you said yes when he asked you to marry him. remember every bride gets cold feet before their wedding, but they go through with it because they love the man their with. best of luck to you, i hope the best, and ill keep you in my prayers.|`|L5YWWVRjaa	All I can say is to speak to your fiance about what you are feeling and see what he says, Four years is a long time to be in a relationship with someone, you learn to know what they are like as a person.<br>  <br>  Pre-wedding stress does put a strain on any relationship and can cause couples to break up. I know the day before my wedding I was at war with my husband to be - we spoke and resolved our problems.<br>  <br>  Also your parents are putting pressure on you, whether to cancel or not.<br>  <br>  Go and visit your local church and speak to a priest with your fiance or get some pre-marriage counseling before you almost make a big mistake.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Second thoughts are very common in those about to be married. If you have ANY doubts then do something NOW.  It will be chaos if you wait too long and total disaster if you go ahead and are not sure.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	I broke an engagement in less than a month from the date of our marriage and I'm so glad I did.  I had the same situation, the man was nice and treated me really well but there were several things about him that started getting on my nerves mostly irresponsibility mostly in regards to bad decisions with money (really bad).  We canceled the wedding, I gave him the ring back but we remained friends and dated some.  It was for the best and I found a man that was a much better match for me.<br>  <br>  I have to tell you, marriage is not an easy thing.  If you go into it with questions I promise you it's not going to get any better.  My personal opinion would be break it off now to avoid financial penalties and take time to make sure this is the best thing for you or not.  Good luck!  :)|`|n8lXItGraa	If you're having this many doubts...cancel the wedding for now.  Explain to your fiance that you're not sure you're ready for that commitment yet and suggest putting the wedding off for a year or so.  This will give you time to re evaluate what you love about him, and accept what you can not change about him.  The extra time might be all you need to come to a final decision.   Hope this helps....|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	You aren't going to change him.  If you are unhappy now it only gets worse after the honeymoon when he starts farting in front of you and not flushing the toilet after taking a dump|`|Tc23KWgzaa	There is an old saying, "Keep your eyes wide open before marriage.  After marriage you must be blind.'<br>  <br>  I didn't know my husband well when we married.  We'd only been seeing each other for a few months.  I got cold feet, too, because I couldn't imagine a life with him.  <br>  <br>  But one absolute necessity was there, so I went through with it.  What was it?  The Peace of God deep in my heart.  It felt good, it felt right, and my heart told me that God had chosen this man for me.  God gave me an absolute jewel.  Twenty-four years ago.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  Look inside,<br>  TX Mom|`|f3SyOyMEaa	You are having cold feet, but you named too many things about him and your differences than just having the wedding jitters. I promise you, that if you're not completely sure about the person....don't go through with it. It is a commitment, a legal binding, a (supposedly) life long contract. You may love him, but you're talking the rest of your life. I know...I have been in your shoes.<br>  <br>  If you want to cancel the wedding and are able to tell him how you feel (in nice terms) and explain that you just feel overwhelmed but still want to see him, then that's what you should do. If he won't see you anymore over this, then maybe you made the right decision after all.<br>  BE SURE OF WHAT YOU WANT and don't do something just because it's what you think that you should do at this point. Life is too short.

My question to you is do you want to have sex for the experience or because you want to give this most perfect gift you will ever have to someone that you plan on spending some time with. Or just want to have sex because you are curious. Yes I know I sound old fashion but after my first time i felt horrible and just wanted a do over but it was to late.

Which is why he didn't reply and does not want to give you mixed signals. (even though he is)<br>  <br>  He could also be busy.|`|5I2yEyOQaa	More than likely he has another girlfriend. It is a great ego boost for a guy when he can have one girl pining for him and another in his bed. Or maybe he is really insecure. Or he just likes you as a friend and is ignoring you hoping that you will back off and just see him as a friend and nothing more.|`|TiJ9ZISGaa	how tender where the messages? and maybe a parent saw this...............     ...... the periods are there just to make you think what they might have done.|`|9167fa19ace7dcedf3455af90acdd59eaa	Give the guy time to reply... maybe he didn't get your message, or hasn't had the opportunity to get back to you.|`|BwaHkJ7Taa	Because like most guys he doesnt kno what he wants|`|jLfH4VH1aa	quit overthinking it..let it come to you|`|XAkYFP1raa	i dont think races matter...both of u r human and ordinary ppl...dont mean this has to be a racial thing...<br>  <br>  but anywayz...<br>  <br>  i think maybe he was trying to play a lil game and maybe u scared him off by sending those messeges.....<br>  <br>  u should hav held ur distance because its never too good to automatically give in to  a situation....<br>  realize this---->The love game is a hard battle.....and if u just give in to any little situation you will lose the battle.....so let this game be over and play tricks yourself just to see if these ppl care enough to break those tricks and walls u put up...and when they do they will be back...<br>  <br>  <br>  on the meanwhile live life and think about the ppl who r there with u and meet new ppl....<br>  just like u met him and went out wit him<br>  it could happen all over again but in a better and different way with another perosn...<br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  hopefully u find the one sumday who will love u and respect u the rest of ur life!

Since he's with someone else at the moment, I'd say it's more likely that he's trying to actually be a good friend. It doesn't so much mean that you have no chance, just that he likes this other girl more... for now.<br>  <br>  PS I added you as a contact b/c you give some awesome answers. It's kinda sad that you've had to ask this question like 5 times, but I guess nobody is answering, and that does get kinda frustrating. Shame on you for using good grammar... I refuse to write like an uneducated dope too, and I also don't get a lot of answers to my questions. Y!A can really suck in that regard.
4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	Maybe she wants to make sure you aren't upset with her about your last conversation.  <br>  <br>  Maybe she thinks you still want her back and she calls you to rant about her new man just to mess with you.  <br>  <br>  I don't know why but just be cool and it will blow over.  You should know that by now.|`|rGci1ehoaa	it sounds like she is having relationship problems and wants advice and i think she is asking you if you are okay so that maybe you will ask her how she is so she can vent to you more lol.... that or she is doing it to be a *****.. thinking you are still pining over her.

There were reasons why you got divorced and they are not going to change.  Good luck to you.|`|iizKx4Bvaa	sounds like she is kicking herself in the romp every time she sees you cause things have not gone according to her plan. Life is a complicated beast. Karma is real too.

GOOD LUCK! i hope everything works out okay!|`|94b8KImYaa	Maybe she is fishing to see if you are seeing someone, since the new relationship seems not to be what she might hoped for. Just tell her that you appreciate that she asked, but that you are fine. <br>  Or just answer everytime and don't think about it any further.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	some people think you are only ok is you are in a relationship.  Ignore her, she wants to know your business.|`|bO2rzfISaa	So, I assume she had problems when you were married. It seems she has problems still. Did you think the divorce would solve her problems? All you can really control is your reaction to them, so stop letting her bug you. If you want to confront it you can tell her to stop asking if you're fine, but it's kind of mean. Better to just blow it off. Be glad she's really not your problem any more.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	try keeping your relationship limited to parenting issues and not personal..this would reduce stress and tensions..after all you are no longer together and had issue to cause the divorce in the first place..you can maintain a friendly conversation without going into deep issues|`|tU5NJVL3aa	You answered your own question -- just say to her what you told us "things are great right now for me."  Every time same question, give the same answer ... I think that will end the questions eventually.|`|m81dfyOYaa	I think your ex is looking for an opening to start up the relationship.
teisU4E2aa	i turned to online dating cuz im shy and its working out good we are getting married in aug. yes im Very happy i did|`|OHfZFR31aa	We're not married yet but very serious and we met on match.com. I went online because I have 4 friends who have married people they met online and another friend had just met the most amazing guy there as well. So I figured I may as well give it a chance. The guy I'm with now is only the second person I went out with. The first guy was ok, just not much in common when we met and we didn't go out again.<br>  <br>  If you go with a serious dating site, especially one that charges money, you know that most of the people on there are really looking for a relationship. If they were just looking for hookups, there are plenty of free places to advertise or sites like nerve.com that are specifically for hook-ups.  <br>  <br>  Honestly had I not gone online, I never would have met him. He and I both work a lot and travel with our jobs, neither of us are into bars or clubs, we both love museums and foreign films - and you don't really talk to other people at the movies or art museums.|`|egpVC6uMaa	I met my husband online...not on a dating site, just through chat. We dated for almost two yrs and we have been married for 3yrs. I still consider myself the luckiest girl in the world ...and yes, we are still very much in love and happy together.|`|AA11329026	i met my spouse online... it was through a game we both played. we clicked and ending up talking all the time, then met... been married 3 years and have 2 kids now.|`|AA11204355	i know personally 3 couples that have met online and subsequently married. 2 of the 3 are  now separated (in 5 yrs. or less). <br>  <br>  This is not to say that it is because of the online dating issue. I mean the divorce rate is 47% anyway online couple or not. <br>  <br>  I would just STRONGLY suggest DO NOT rush into anything. Its great that you communicate several hours online but there are still 16+ hours of the day you do not spend with this person. YOu never truly know someone until you are in their presence and see how they act in life,towards you and others.|`|7aoHmM4baa	yes i meet him online<br>  it turned out great<br>  i think i was very lucky,because i was in deep problems and misery when i met him<br>  and now i am doing very very good<br>  thank god<br>  and like we were only friends,and after only 2 month of really dating ,we end it up married,right after marriage we end it up getting pr-ego<br>  now we have a wonderful baby<br>  and by the way we are going ,i can tell we are going to last for ever|`|4NcshCDvaa	I met my fiance online. It is going amazing for me. I think we are so perfect for each other..<br>  I didn't really plan to meet him online it kind of just happened. It was fate! hah <br>  And we have been dating for two years and now were are engaged. He doesn't get a lot of time to visit (we live in different states) but we make it work and I love him with everything I am!|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	No I didn't meet my husband online.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	I've only heard horror stories...|`|njhKtCTKaa	MMM good question.  I met my husband on myspace 21/2 years ago.  We dated about 3 months before getting married, and to be totally honest, it was the best decision ive ever made.  we've now been married over 2 years and we are expecting our first baby in April.  Honestly, before i would not have recommended it, those types of relationships dont always last, especially if you marry after only 3 months, but i guess we were the exception to the rule.  Its 50/50, could go either way, just make sure you get to know each other in person as well as online.  It could work.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun ;)
156d702b8908052bd0660d07c6803996aa	I believe that there is someone out there for everyone. So sorry this jerk did this to you. He gave you some trust issues but not all guys are this way.

We, as humans, go through life settling for anyone who will give us love and that we can love at that moment in our life.  We search and search, and unfortunately, some of us never find "the one".  I made many mistakes, marrying frogs, because I didn't put my trust and faith in God or myself.  Till now,  And I know for a fact, that the man I love, is my soulmate, finally, I found him.  He believes that God brought us together too.  You need to learn to love yourself, by yourself and for yourself.  And then you will, surprisingly, find the "one" meant for you.  This guy you speak of, just isn't it.  Never settle, you deserve to loved, honored, and cherished for you.  God bless you and good luck|`|yRRnbNqXaa	I believe there is someone for everyone, but we might never find them.. or we had already found them, but the time or circumstances were wrong, and we let them go (or had to let them go)... I believe the later happened to me :( <br>  <br>  i do hope that the guy you're talking about wasn't the one person for you, though, and that the one who is is still somewhere out there waiting :)|`|7aoHmM4baa	yeah some women are not meant to get married no matter how hard they try<br>  but don t worry you may find someone better<br>  he s no good for you<br>  i think he doesn t love you|`|KK0ZrWm3aa	sorry to hear about your misfortune but please don't label all men the same we are not all complete jerks good luck|`|TWNh6Dooaa	Your question doesn't really tally with your subject matter...<br>  <br>  I DO believe there's someone for everyone, but as Snowflake above me said, you might not find them, or find them and can't be with them owing to circumstance :-( This I think happened to me with the married guy I was seeing, but then again if we were meant for each other he could have been with me..<br>  <br>  ..But I digress...<br>  <br>  I said in an earlier post from last year, that my boss from a previous job was in  her 50s, smart and capable, own house, enough money, but just NEVER found anyone to share her life with. I asked a colleague and she told me that the woman DID want a life partner but simply never found anyone. <br>  <br>  That story really scared me. So when people say "he's out there", "he'll turn up when you least expect it" etc - DON'T BELIEVE IT. It did NOT happen for my ex boss, so it doesn't happen for "everyone" at all.

jiY4YQ56aa	She's definitely interested in you. She very well might be waiting for you to make the first move. Until you know what the deal is with her & this guy she's been seeing on Facebook, you have nothing stopping you from asking her out. Like the previous answer said, she's almost certainly playing hard to get. Flirting with you at the gym, calling out to you from cars, catching your gaze in the reflection of the window....yes she totally likes you. I would just ask her to ride the bus with you next time you see her at the stop or ask for her number & see what she's into. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Of4TLMdeaa	It sounds like she might just be desperate for male attention.

Surprise is when she's never thought of you as being more than just a friend, or asking at a bad time (eg: exam time) or if both of you don't see each other outside of school and you notice her, but she has no idea that you exist. Introduce yourself, and wait till she knows your name before going for the 'will you go out with me' question. <br>     other than that, i think the classic "will you go out with me" will work as much as making up a novel way to ask. If you think your chances are low though, you'll need to put some more effort in, rather than having the classic line. Whatever you think of doesn't really matter, as long as it's individual, shows your personality and style, and doesn't freak the girl out. <br>     Tips: And don't ask her in a crowded place or where there's a lot of people hanging around... because it might be hard for her to hear anything... (a great way for misinterpretation to occur), and girls get self conscious too. They don't want pressure, if their friends are hearing, and most of them don't want to hurt a guys feelings by rejecting them publicly... but if you are indeed 'below grade' for them, they will still reject you - in the nicest possible way, but it's still not that good. So less people within hearing range around = better for both of you.<br>     Not sure or don't know answers are not 'no' answers, so don't take it as a 'no'. (unless of course, the girl is just trying to reject without hurting your feelings). You'll have to figure out which one it is... if it's the 2nd one, no amount of persuasion will work of course.  <br>   ----------------------------------------...  Now, what's the best way to go about asking someone out on a date? Here's what NOT to do: "Would you like to go out with me?" This may sound like a logical way to express your interest in her but believe me, unless she already harbors a crush on you, it rarely works.<br>  This does two things. Firstly, it sets you up for rejection. It's easy for her to say "No, I'm not free." (For a complete list on how to tell if a girl dislikes you, see our section on Flirting, how to tell if she hates you) You know she doesn't want to go out with you simply because you have not even specified a time yet.<br>  Not only is this very demoralizing, it will also make you lose confidence when asking other girls out to go dating. Secondly, you feel scared to ask her out because you know how easy it's for her to reject you. Bad flirting technique. <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  "Hey! I would really like to get together and do something with you sometime."<br>  Now, she can't say, "Sorry, I'm not free" (By far the most popular rejection line) because you haven't set the time yet. In fact, you have not even asked her for a date yet! Now is your chance to observe her reaction (refer to my section on Flirting, Signs women give when aroused). If it's negative, forget about it. Remember, you haven't asked her out yet so you haven't been rejected! Using this method will protect you from rejection and make you more confident the next time you try and ask a single woman out. But if she lights up and says "OK" or if she emits any one of the signals explained in Flirting, How to tell if a single girl likes you, continue with:<br>  "You know, I would really like to go out with you when you're free. How about Lunch at Tony Romas on Tuesday?"<br>  Firstly, she can't say, "Sorry not free." simply because it'll make her sound like a complete idiot since she has already said that she would like to go out with you. By all means try saying it out aloud yourself. If she really is not free that day, simply ask her when she will be able to make it. Secondly, she has to be free sometime right? Using this proven technique will ensure that you score when asking single women out.<br>  Look, this method isn't fool proof. If she does not want to go out with you, there is no way you can force her to go out on a date. For example, one of the teens we counseled reported that when he used this line on a friend, she kept on saying that she was not free, although it did sound pretty awkward. It went something like this. <br>  Him: What about Saturday?<br>  Her: Not free.<br>  Him: Sunday?<br>  Her: I'm busy.<br>  Him: Next Saturday?<br>  Her: Sorry, I really cannot make it.<br>  He took the hint and ended the conversation. However, on the plus side, it is of interest to note that because he said "Hey! I would really like to get together and do something with you sometime" She had to reply with, "Okay, like what?" and he was never rejected outright. This is much less painful than having, "Would you like to go out?" answered with an outright, "No." Another method she could have used to dissuade him would be to explain that she already had a boyfriend.<br>  This method is best used when asking face to face. It might be easier for you to ask her out on the phone but remember, it is also easier for her to reject you on the phone as well. And never, ever, use ICQ.|`|74c07e4c6826987afbc360c217948f0faa	Tell him or her you give great head.
svoDn3mCaa	it's a tough situation.  my advice: try to stay out of her love life completely.  My best guy friend has gone out with or crushed on girls that make me cringe.  fortunately, i'm good at offering input only when asked.  but, as old fasioned as it seems, i still believe that honestly is the best policy.  so if she asks you straigh out give her ur opinion but not so much that it will completely offend her.  after all, it is her decision in the end.  don't change for one person.|`|AA11561010	if your friend is happy with him, then you should be happy for her. dont try to ruin her relationship, even if you do hate her bf

I917Iztaaa	I always find love and relationships impossible to predict. One day you're on top of the world, and know the person of your dreams fancies you, the next day, you've suffered a knock back, and are depressed as hell about it all. The next minute, just when you think all is lost, and you're ready to move on, that person shows interest in you again.<br>   Give it time, if he is interested, he'll let you know. Make sure you give him plenty of chances to show his interest.|`|XHwmsqVlaa	I can't beleive your making a move on your exs m8 you deserve the knock back|`|tFfUMQtyaa	He sounds like he is NOT interested in you...Get over it and move on|`|YgZDXDgFaa	I think that there could've been a better time for any kind of move. It's really harsh that you would want anything to happen especially since Alex was your ex. Both of them are mates, and in the end (unless he isn't a good mate) guys choose bro's before.. girls. <br>  From experience, getting involved with more than one guy in a circle of friends is really not a good move. <br>  Hope you make a cool decision and not make things messy and difficult for your mates.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	I used to be an amateur boxer, and remember u have to get up.

Trust me, it'll help.|`|7sqpiGgoaa	dump em both, find a new circle of friends|`|zcjff25baa	i doubt jake said it bc he didn't want to kiss you.  guys arent tht complicated. he probably said it cuz him and alex are best friends, and just like girls have the complicated, straight down to it girl code, guys have a slightly dumber version that they follow. If alex still likes you jake was prob following something in the guy code. I dont know the full guy code, I only know what all my guy friends have told me, but I'm pretty sure thts why.<br>  <br>  Oh and by the way this is going to sound totally out of the blue but by any chance do you live in Alsip? Cuz I know a guy named Alex in Alsip and he has a best friend named Jake. So when I was answering your question it just sorta clicked and I was wondering if you would tell me if your Alex is the Alex I know. If you don't mind, could you add me to your contacts on this and then email me?|`|WGadfTJaaa	If you met Jake through Alex chances are Alex has probably said something about you  which may be the cause of Jake's lack of interest.<br>  <br>  I find that guys respond better if you don't chase after them,Jake can see how you feel about him so when you act like you couldn't care less about him that's when you'll get his attention and as my Nana use to say to me  A little bit of competition never hurts if he thinks your lost interest in him that's when He'll show interest so start looking  for another target to flirt with.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|mC2dRyuMaa	Well tell jake that you dnt like alex at all and you understand that there both friends but alex has to move on because you have and ask jake if there was more behind what he told you about alex be like i like you and if you dont just tell me because i dont wana wait around like a fool, make him feel bad for not kissn u lol well gd luck bye|`|hfg4SbEkaa	no, he did not just say it because he doesnt wanna kiss you, its justt that it was alex's birthday and he didnt want to hurt alex on his birthday. dont take it too hard hunnie|`|K119R72Caa	he just doesn't want alex to be upset maybe.

It is never too early to find, nor too late. <br>  Take your time - never be in a hurry - realize you may feel bad without someone, but that is no reason to jump into what may be the same rut.

If it was irrelevant then you wouldn't mind being married to a woman with two husbands and share your marriage bed with another man. <br>  <br>  If you can't or don't want to make a commitment to only one woman, then don't get married. Because a marriage is one man and one woman who forsaken all others. If you want to live with and support two women and the children you have with them, there is no law that says you can't and you call this relationship with these women what ever you want.<br>  <br>  You can't marry two women because it's WRONG and it goes against all the vows you take when you get married.<br>  <br>  Yes, Polygamy is illegal in Utah and EVERY state in the United States. Sorry, it looks like you are living in the wrong country for the life style you want to live. <br>  <br>  I have to admit though, there is something interesting about living in a house with 2 men, with 2 pay checks for me to spend and I can sleep with who I want when ever I want. Hmmm! Maybe you should try being with a woman who already has another man, instead of you having two women. There would be more money, but of course a lot less sex for you. You would have to be the one to share, not her. LOL<br>  <br>  Just think of everything I can get in a divorce settlement when I get bored and divorce them for two new husbands. <br>  <br>  You are a fool and kidding yourself if you actually think you can handle two women. When they divorce you and they will because women don't like to share, they will take you for everything you have and more, then throw your greety butt on the street to live your life on the street with the rest of the homeless people.

Just imagine: you have 2 wives and 5 kids (can the 3 of you support that many kids?), one wife decides to divorce you. Now she wants part of the house. You and your other wife are forced to sell your house. Your other wife would be put in a bad position for no particular reason, that is, assuming she wasn't the one trying to poison the other gal all the time. Resolving issues between 2 people is bad, but resolving them between 3 people would be much worse.

Most men do not have three houses and so forth.  So they do not want you to be able to have two wives, for when they both want divorced, you cannot pay them and the state will have to assume care for at least one of them.  They dont want to do so.<br>  <br>  Because it is almost impossible to make one woman happy, let alone two.  You would have a better shot at winning the big lottery, four times in a row then to be able to make them both happy.<br>  <br>  Because you cannot get enough sex to make all the problems worth it.  And they would stick together and cut you off at the same time anyway.<br>  <br>  Women when together for a while, start to have the same menstrual cycle.  So they would both be on that cycle at the same time, meaning more cranking and maybe no sex at all.  Trust me, your life would be in danger and you would possibly wish to commit suicide for at least one week of the month, from all the complaints you would hear.<br>  <br>  That is my take on it.

If he's someone the husband knows, whom the couple hang out with all the time and whom she meets with frequently, then I don't think she needs to announce it every time. But if it's a male friend she doesn't see often, especially if the husband hasn't met him, then I think it makes sense to tell him just to avoid any awkward moments later. Like, what if someone the husband knows sees her, and tells him, and he doesn't know who the guy is?

That's what works for us and we are happy but to each their own...|`|lXpGlAm3aa	No,I don't.Just be honest in the first place.If your husband isn't the type to get jealous,still tell him.If he is the jealous type,tell him.Even if there is a high level of trust in your relationship.I would still bring it up in conversation.<br>  <br>  IDK,just like covering your butt.If other haters saw you in a restraunt,and go tell your husband."I saw your wife with some guy last tuesday, blah blah blah".So at least everything is out on the table.<br>  <br>  Okay,without business,No.It just to me, looks strange?|`|60a21d73367b6bc125257e3aedc3acc9aa	Depends on how secure the relationship is. I have been out and about before and my man be at work. Run into or talk to a friend (yes a man) and eat lunch. It's ok. Just like he's had old friends (yes girls) that I haven't even met go to his work to see him ( he works in a restaurant). It's ok. Sooner or later we mention it in conversation, because that's what we do we talk to each other and communicate.<br>  <br>  If theres nothing going on then eventually you'll end up mentioning it. And if you forget every now and again, so what, it happens|`|goaNob34aa	It depends on the husband; if he's the type of husband who would want to know, then tell him.  If he doesn't care about that stuff, then don't tell him.  Most husbands care, so it's not right most of the time.  Best advice is to tell the husband.|`|Wf8PbTraaa	sure as long as nothing is going on.<br>  <br>  but then shes gonna have to deal with it when he meets women for lunch.....as long as nothing is going on.|`|o5piRiBsaa	If I was meeting a male friend for lunch (and not with a group, or for work), I'd let him know.  I have nothing to hide.|`|ubbKS6BBaa	No. I would tell my husband that I'm meeting some guy for business.  Or don't if you feel like it's a date.|`|RlyFedI3aa	As long as it's ok for him to do the same and they both use rubbers, we all know whats being served|`|BUET39wmaa	just meeting male friends for lunch?<br>  well I would be concerned about why she has these male friends if the husband isn't comfortable with them and why he isn't comfortable?<br>  <br>  too many questions to answer first|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Hell no.<br>  <br>  That's very inappropriate and disrespectful to her husband and marriage.<br>  <br>  If she has nothing to hide then why keep it a secret from her husband.|`|wzqahEqiaa	There is nothing wrong with married people having a business lunch with someone else.  If a couple respects each other and they are faithful to their marriage vows there is nothing to be concerned about.<br>  <br>  My parents have been faithfully married for almost 35 years.  They've both had lunch with other people.  They didn't ask each other before having lunch.  My parents trust each other, they don't keep secrets, and have never been unfaithful.  It's possible for people be friends without sex.|`|B12E4rYiaa	The spouse should be made aware that you're having lunch or dinner or anything else with the opposite sex. Why not tell them if there really is nothing to hide? It's best to have other people with you or go to lunch with the girls. This is how affairs begin ever so casually.|`|mYmR5cX5aa	Depends on the otherwise.<br>  Business luncheon, why does she need to inform you ? It's business.<br>  Male friends on her day off, yes she should tell you.|`|v398Qalyaa	well, the question would be why do they need it to be a secret? i have done, but am not proud of it|`|OHfZFR31aa	Women in business have to meet men for business lunches and dinners all the time. That's just part of working life. She doesn't have to tell her husband, just like he doesn't have to tell her when he's having a business lunch with a female colleague.<br>  <br>  I certainly don't tell my man whenever I have a business meal and he doesn't tell me either. It doesn't matter. There is nothing sexual going on|`|6cm6MB66aa	Leave out business ?  If there is no business then why is she meeting the guy ? No cant see it that's what your sign for when you got married . He needs a date for lunch let him find his own . I don't care how lonely or what his problem is your wife should not be loaned out like a car . Of course if you and the Gentleman come up with some sort of an agreement then fine for you but for her to just go is kind of cheating with her and your emotions|`|XGgPhaDbaa	If your wife has to have business lunches with people of the opposite sex then it is business. Get over it and work on why you are so insecure and jealous.<br>  Don't do anything to get her fired.<br>  <br>  I have to have business contacts with a lot of men but I have NEVER even as much as flirted w/ them. It is unprofessional.|`|GdBjTovfaa	mine did it all the time, my husband i mean , i trusted him and he hurt me.. i do not think its right.. but there are lots of people who cheat and have no feelings for other people .. or how they will make changes in the person who loved them.. the life we have on earth is short .. i just think god will deal with cheaters in the next life and thats the one that matters..|`|pb7qPJcxaa	Of course it is.  You wouldn't mind your hubby doing that either without your knowledge.  After all, it's "Just lunch"|`|TxDrVt3haa	Perfectly fine if it's "on the clock" . If it's after hours, he deserves to know.|`|Z8WGDv5paa	yes, as long as it is platonic and not a romantic interest for you.|`|62909943f9a604753421e4538bb2ce22aa	i don't think its right
qEr7QSjiaa	How  would you feel if something bad happened to your Mom,and you were not going to apologize to her for calling her a liar and saying you hate her? you only have one Mom and when she is gone you'll hate yourself and blame yourself  for her not being around anymore. She is acting like that to you because you are acting like that to her.|`|7EcoKxhlaa	It ok to hate the way people act and the things they do but it is good to love the person, especially your mom. It is very normal to be at odds with parents as we grow older.. but the sweeter you are and the more understanding you are towards her the kinder she will most likely be back. If you tell her how it hurts when she does not keep her word rather than calling her a liar, it may work better.  I am hoping that you can find some things that you appreciate about her and let the hurt go for a while. I am hoping that you can spend some really positive time together with your mom and that it will include a haircut!<br>  <br>   Hey, I know when my daughter does something out of the ordinary, like emptying the dishwasher without my asking and when she apologizes even when it was partly my fault,  I get a tender place in my heart for her. Things like that make me want to give all I can to please her! I wish you well! Love Shell|`|ETtbbGEzaa	i don't think that you should say you hate her because if it wasn't for her you would not be hear by the help of your father to but.and the reason why i think she didn't take you to get your haircut but she let your sister get hers is because You made a big fuss about it before she could take you so she thought you were being a bit rude.but i think that you should apologize because you should just have your waited an everything|`|pEztJVlbaa	u didn't do anything to apologize for<br>  that's weird shes acting a bit immature<br>  but im sure she will come through<br>  don't say hate its a harsh word :)<br>  x|`|pPKhVRXJaa	grow up!|`|AA10423186	just  tell  here
jbEjq5aHaa	as a teenager myself there are some things that parents wont ever understand, she is probably just dealing with some stress from skool (like cliques, now days they influence basically everything that happens, parents now days didnt hav to deal with them as much as we do now and there really isnt anything u can do)<br>  when there is so much stress from skool sometimes u really cant concentrate and giving a teenager a bk really wont help<br>  try talking to her about it and be open and try to understand wat its like to be a teenager  and if she doesnt want to talk about it just giv her some space and the more open u r about it she mite eventually feel like opening up|`|tWvM6M0raa	i'm not a parent but i will still answer for you<br>  <br>  that is exactly what i was like when i was 15, i couldn't care less about school and all i did was sit in the house either watching tv or on the computer<br>  <br>  she will probably grow out of it, i did. i am 18 now and i find it boring to be in the house to long, i prefer now to be out with friends or even having friends at my house.<br>  <br>  it is just a teenage thing, at least you no where she is and she is not getting up to anything bad|`|3CgtetyGaa	your an idiot! taking her tv and cell phone? she is just a teenager, it's what they do! duh. almost all teenagers are like this!|`|PnpoBSxraa	Actually, its a phase we all go through. We'll I did anyway. It might be the she doesnt "want friends" because she cant seem to make any. <br>  <br>  It could be depression, so it might help to get her into therapy, because it couldnt hurt... but it might if you dont.|`|LJLyNsmKaa	Sounds like symptoms of depression. I would try to arrange for counseling, sound like you have tried what you can. I commend you for that but sounds to me like you have done what you can and you need some outside help. I wish you all the best.
RDgyb7W8aa	When you are home, how about some family activities, see if you can get two other people to play cards with your dad.  Does he bowl, get him to go bowling and you go with him.  There ought to be other family activities you can do.  Maybe go play some pool with him.
mAorBf7saa	Yesssssssssss.  I am two years younger than my sister, and we go to the same school.  Every time she sees me, she runs up and hugs me and says "This is my precious, I love her."  Then she laughs as I turn bright red and my friends laugh at me, and then walks away with her friends and it is seriously the most embarrassing thing since ripping the butt of your jeans.  But hey, you can't choose your siblings, right?|`|Rp2Gkzg1aa	YES! my sister is younger. she thinks i like this guy,I DON'T! she always says that i like him in front of my family.one time she started sayin "Alyssa likes'.....'" IN FRONT OF HIS HOUSE!(luckily he wasn't outside) i took her behind the car and pratically tackled her.lol...<br>  <br>  yes|`|e9ZCYlT0aa	my brother's the opposite, he hits me and doesn't bother giving me a glance in the hallways<br>  <br>  anywho, no|`|yYgsyopAaa	No. I love my brothers and sister, and would do anything for them. Having them express their love for me...embarrassing?...not a chance. It makes me feel proud to know that the think enough of me to accept me in front of the world. If you are embarrassed by you brother's actions, maybe you are the one who needs to rethink why...embarrassed because he wants to be around you?...he's your brother! Try being proud of that, because if you are, I guarrentee that your friends won't make you feel embarrassed ~ they'll probably be jealous.
bO2rzfISaa	Try Singles and Dating. Most of us in Marriage and Divorce are way beyond these sorts of games.|`|mcUSz16kaa	You already said your damage, and you may have hurt him in the process.   Move on and let it go.  You might be surprised later, if he was really into you,  but don't push any further.|`|nC6qEW1Paa	He might think you're just messing with him, after you told him you weren't into him it's a normal thing to think. If you want to fix it you have to tell him why you said no, if you haven't already. Explain to him in detail what you were thinking when you said you weren't attracted to him and let him know you're serious about starting a relationship. If he still doesn't respond then he doesn't want anything more than some fun.|`|PAA4uWPuaa	There are these cool little keys on the keyboard, you should try them out. <br>  Shift- allows you to put the first word in the sentence in caps. It helps denote a new sentence. <br>  Space bar- it puts a space between words/sentences and allows the reader to take a breath.
JtEBaOdjaa	Scrap the pictures. They sound like a sweet idea but always look like a weird shrine.<br>  <br>  We're leaving 2 empty chairs with single roses on them (one for my grandpa and one for his mom).<br>  If you have a program, mention their names in there. If not, you can mention them in a prayer, or speech. but don't do the pictures.|`|76db084b0636ae593b0b3c0e95cb3838aa	I think the picture frame and rose idea are lovely however the empty seat just doesnt seem right and in fact, this is just for me id fint it hard to enjoy the wedding seeing that. I think you could have a nice little table set up with a bunch of roses on and a photo either side. It would be just as nice and good to remember them but without making anyone there feel weird about it.|`|U8oR3VU6aa	Wow. I think that is a beautiful idea. Some people may think it a bit off, but it is your wedding and some people will judge anything you do anyway. I think it is a great declaration of love and how much they meant to you.|`|cdL4wzGbaa	Thats a lovely idea.Not weird at all.|`|AA10423186	be  neat  idea|`|0KzbWxROaa	No, i don't think it is wierd. Very touching for all the family who obviously know how much you think of your grandparents. It might be a bit upsetting for some, so check it out with other members of family to see what they think first.I think its a lovely idea|`|5RewiMkuaa	This is very normal. You see this happen in all sorts of occasions. Graduations when a classmate has passed away, and just other places where you are missing a loved one. <br>  It's beautiful. <br>  All the luck in the world to you.|`|nQAnjubCaa	no i don't think it's weird. i thinks it's very thoughtful of you guys. I think that you should remember them and it's important that you remember them on your Special day|`|AA11066099	Lovely idea but it is a little unusual, maybe you could mention them  and how important they both are to you in the ceremony.x|`|4EozzPDSaa	i think that is a lovely idea, atleast it shows your still thinking of them and want them to be there for your wedding.<br>  so so sweet (:|`|deZArjX7aa	I think it's sweet, but a little weird. Couldn't you just put something in the bulletin like "in memory of...."?|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	i dont think it would be wierd.  actually its becoming more and more common. both of my brothers did it, and my fiance and i plan on doing it. his grandmother was SOOOOOO excited to come to the wedding but unfortunatly she became very ill and passed away two weeks before thanksgiving.  we're leaving an open chair with a beautiful picture of her on her wedding day to his grandpa
cLPimVR6aa	May be your daughter just do not know how to communicate. Also, may be you feel like you have to spend time with her 'cause you are not married to her mom and you were not there when she was growing up. Just avoid spending time with her for the time being.|`|7aoHmM4baa	i disagree with you big time<br>  she is a teen,she needs you,you are her daddy<br>  you need to love her and listen to her<br>  or you prefer she lets a guy listen to her and make her feel good about her self,then make her pregnant???<br>  anyway i don t like you right now<br>  don t MiX relation ship between ex with kids<br>  because that your child your blood and flesh<br>  you need counseling with your daughter|`|XmudUg2aaa	No offensive, really.<br>  <br>  But it is not surprising that you two are having communication issues.  From what you have written, you don't communicate very well either.|`|PAA4uWPuaa	Well yes and no. <br>  My daughter is all girl and sometimes I sit and listen to whatever daily drama she is yacking about and honestly think "What the hell?"<br>  But I listen because it is important to her. Thats what being a parent is about.|`|k7SOs18raa	this is who your daughter is and you need to respect her...she is part of you so maybe you have some of that non sense in you...which i can see...you love your kids regardless...maybe you need a head eval|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	I am surprised your teenager even wants to spend time with you!<br>  Just spend equal amount of time with your children and be thankful for the time you have with them.|`|3wjOk0Saaa	Well right now your daughter is at that wonderful age where you need to realize she is going through all kinds of changes. Reflect to when you were 15.. You knew it all, and NOBODY could tell you anything. She needs your understanding, and support. I do not know your whole story,(but I know from mine) but take into consideration that maybe mom has said, and told her things about you that may not be a total truth. Maybe she is looking at things from 1 side, and mom has he somewhat set against you. I do not know that, I just know what my ex has tried to do to me in regards to my son.|`|bO2rzfISaa	I have an 18 yo w/ bipolar. She beat the h*ll out of me when we lived together. I can only deal with her for brief periods of time. Don't expect anyone to understand not liking your child. It's so unnatural. However, I totally get it.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	I think you better make an effort to find out common ground, and soon. In a few years, your daughter will lose interest, and stop talking to you...period. <br>  <br>  "Things that do not matter?" Maybe they do...to her.<br>  Try and find out why she is so interested in them,. <br>  <br>  It sounds to me that you enjoy the son because you can do "guy stuff" with him...but your daughter is too much trouble for you to bother with. <br>  <br>  I'm not trying to be unkind---but you are sending a strong message here...and your daughter might not miss the point.|`|gfHutvEFaa	grow up. Be a father. Christ!<br>  <br>  Reading this you sound like a whiny *****. Sounds like you like being with your son. Period. Doesn't matter if you don't have a lot in common with your daughter.

Hopefully she has a step father that treats her with love and respect.|`|a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	it's the age.  honestly it probably has nothing to do with you but that is the way teenagers are.  and it lasts for a while, so get used to it.<br>  <br>  at least she wants to talk to you at all.  when i was 15, i hated my parents and did everything i could to avoid them.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Maybe it's just the difference between a boy and a girl.  My daughter is SO dramatic,  Everything equals the end of the world with her.  Granted, she is only 3, but I see it getting worse as she becomes a teenager.  I love her very much, nothing will change that, but she is a very high spirited child.<br>  <br>  Now, your daughter is a teenage girl and they care about things that men don't care about.  They care about clothes and shoes and hairstyles and makeup and famous people...  Maybe you should take an interest in her.  She probably feels like you don't really care about her because you're not interested in the things she is.|`|TxDrVt3haa	It's totally normal to not like your own child sometimes.  Most people don't admit it, but it's true.<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind her purpose is not to interest, enrich or entertain YOU, it's more the other way around.  These things she talks about do not matter, but they matter to her, silly as they are.  You need not feel any guilt, it isn't productive.  Just think of it as an investment.<br>  <br>  Remember, she'll grow out of it, and the two of you will eventually have the wonderful relationship you crave. When that happens, you don't want her looking back with resentment thinking that you never cared about her, you want her to look back and think "wow, my dad sure was patient with me, what a great dad...I must have been really annoying!" She will realize it one day, I guarantee it!  And even more so the more time & interest you give her now.<br>  <br>  The other thing is, your son will no doubt be a surly teen too one day!!  Right now you are his hero.  once he hits puberty, you will in some respects be his adversary. <br>  <br>  Just remember your daughter is looking to you--she will use you as a model for who she will choose as a partner one day!
4dgrwFU4aa	They are ashamed of the combination of their genes that you carry so whatever it is they express toward you marks a potential with themselves they have been brainwashed to dislike in order to fit with the paradigms of their social life. Now that probably won't help out too much because unfortunately a bizarre effect of accepting the brainwashing or drinking the Kool-Aid is that it fossilizes your identity.

Don't let this get to you .... sometimes parents need time to get used to the fact that their child is different. They will probably say things to your brothers about you, and other family members, but you might be surprised, you might find support in unexpected places. <br>  <br>  Try not to let your resentment towards you family get the better of you. They cannot help who they are. You have nothing to be ashamed of, you know this.|`|8SyUHkPXaa	If your parents are poisonous you need to remove yourself from them altogether.  If you are adult then you can easily do this without their permission.  Move away and don't give them your forwarding address or phone number.

Don't hate your parents because they don't understand you.|`|BX8WI076aa	Know your rights in you city, state and country. You can't argue about rights you should have if you don't know which ones you have already. <br>  Step2Know which political candidates support gays, and to what extent. Just because they're democrats doesn't mean they support gay marraige or gays in the military. <br>  Step3Be clean and well dressed. This is more to the lesbians out there who think that because they are a lesbian they should wear men's clothes. Please stop. <br>  Step4Don't be over the top all of the time. Gay men have a reputation for being crazy and loud even though most are not. Behave in public so you don't enforce this stereotype. <br>  Step5Educate yourself. Most gay people I know are well mannered, well cultured, well spoken and well educated. These people give a good impression to the strait people in their lives who would otherwise only know stereotypes.|`|x2GQ8n6Oaa	Being gay is not a lifestyle choice - it is who you are, and they should accept that, given time they may come to terms with your sexuality.<br>  <br>  Parents do sometimes forget that you have your own life to live, they have expectations for you, sometimes of things they didn't quite achieve in their own life, hence your comment about them not wanting you to have a life, they probably don't see it like that, they wanted what's best for you and unless/until you're a parent yourself this is something you will not fully understand/appreciate.<br>  <br>  I understand also about you saying you're the "black sheep" of the family - well so am I really though I seem to be the only one with my head screwed firmly on my shoulders.  <br>  <br>  If they don't want a relationship with you at the present time, then it's sad, but they're not worth it and you shouldn't let things get you down - you are the better person and more grown up than them it would seem.  Hold your head up high and be proud to be you!!<br>  <br>  It is unacceptable for them to refer to you as a 'gay bastard' regardless of what their issue may be, they should not swear at you/about you - you do not deserve it, and I hope that soon they do see sense, but maybe you would be better off moving out of their property and into one of your own, perhaps the first step to getting your own life.<br>  <br>  The link below may be of interest to you.|`|zvMLbmHcaa	I think you should confront them, talk to them about the signs your translating as being negative towards you.

If you're not someone he'd have a potential relationship with, unless you're pretty good friends, you know, constant and frequent contact and also have stuff to talk about non-stop, he wouldn't spend a lot of time on you. Guys are practical. Or, since it sounds like you mainly have email contact with him now, he could be like 'yeah we'll get to catch up some time', soon enough he'll get distracted and move onto something else. It's just the way guys are|`|mM4d8rpdaa	chillax he will write back eventually mayb hes just busy|`|r6czecIUaa	don't worry he will answer. I think he is busy.

zxQT3Uo5aa	nobody loves a long distance relationship, they just happen circumstantially.  Your resolve may be unable to stand the distance.|`|94b8KImYaa	First of all a long distance relationship is not an easy thing and it takes great effort from both sides. <br>  And everybody is different. Some like to spend a lot of time together, other people need some kind of freedom. So it might just not be for you. Go with your gut feeling. If you meet someone who is not from your area - be upfront on how you feel about ldr's and walk away - even if it is difficult at times. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you|`|MRDJu8v3aa	No, you are not crazy. Long distant relationships are very difficult to maintain… especially if you have not been with the person for a long time before moving apart. <br>  <br>  The question is: What is it about long distant relationships that you like? Why do you keep getting into them? You already know that they do not work for you. Maybe they are in some way safer for you… not as big of a commitment?? I do not know but I think you do. Deal with that issue and you might find yourself in a long term relationship… long distant or not.|`|AA11447210	Few ldr's last. They have more challenges than local relationships and unless you are already involved with someone and they have to be away for a while (such as a military person being deployed) I don't recommend them.<br>  <br>  Chances of an ldr working out for long are very low...especially if the couple has never lived locally and had the opportunity to date a lot and form a solid relationship.|`|cGbTJobeaa	There is nothing wrong with hating long distance relationships.<br>  <br>  Since you dislike them, here's some advice...quit going out on dates and getting into relationships with people who are geographically undesireable.|`|8p31dENPaa	I can't handle a long distance relationship. My boyfriend and I had one for 2 months while he was away on business and it was very hard on him, me and our relationship. We don't get to see each other that often as is, I can't imagine dealing with weeks at a time. We are living for when we finally move in together in a few months.|`|UUrqECXIaa	Long distance relationships can be very difficult for any one  to maintain. The longest distance for a relationship that I was ever in was about 1.5 hours away from each other, so I am not sure if that qualifies as long distance. He worked nights, with his days off being during the week. I worked days. I never expected that the relationship would go beyond an occasional dinner or friendly get together. He relocated, and we ended up getting married.<br>  <br>  If a long-distance relationship is too much of a hassle for you than don't bother pursuing them.|`|SZvJVM2yaa	dude look u had trouble maintaining the one you were with constantly 24-7 what makes u think long distance will work not that im saying its your fault but women are hard to control when u are around them they still nag  what makes u think u can control them when they are tons of miles away|`|4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	No, I wouldn't be able to commit to a long distance relationship.

Y el me pidio perdon que lo disculpara, porque alli si sintio que uno se siente mal.....y gracias a Dios hasta ahorita ya no me lo a hecho... si no lo has hablado con el hablalo porque eso como te desgasta.... haciendonos sentir que no valemos... y pues ojala y cambie...

I just think that you should maybe o some favors or something like lobster, apple cider, and caramel covered apples...... Something that Tastes and looks good....... I would leave the beans out of it though... that sounds a little Bit much................<br>  <br>     Also if you are serving alcohol..... the thing to serve is wine or White russians... this will be a good mood setter..........<br>  <br>           I hope this helps.........|`|qV8Vz36Iaa	It may be disdained by some meat eaters, but as a low-fat vegan, I might find the food delectable.<br>  <br>  I'd spend just a few extra dollars to make sure that you use organic food and whole grain pasta. Minimize the oil, also. If you know any people with high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes, you can promote your meal as one that is delicious and healthy for everyone.<br>  <br>  Make sure you can find a cook who can make low-fat delicious. Healthy does not mean unpalatable.|`|C7wN4NxEaa	not at all.<br>  it's YOUR wedding and whatever you serveis all up to YOU.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	nope, as long as it tastes good.|`|uTIoOa62aa	no|`|igI5yX0vaa	No, it is a celebration and lasagna is tasty!  As a guest, this would stand out in my mind as being meaningful and unique.|`|4POGapREaa	Of course it's okay.  Not every wedding has to be elaborate & over the top.  You're living within your means & that's exactly what you should be doing.  I love lasagna!!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	There's nothing wrong with that menu and it sounds way better than what alot of people serve at weddings. Most people like lasagna so you don't have to offer a choice, especially if you can't afford it. But pasta is ridiculously inexpensive so perhaps offer an alternative pasta dish for someone who doesn't like the lasagna, baked mac and cheese for example.<br>  <br>  That said, what type of beans are you planning to serve? I've never heard of any that go with lasagna. Typically a lasagna meal consists of the lasagna main dish, a side Caesar salad, garlic bread, and dessert.|`|AA10378447	A. Lasagna is a filling meal that doesn't cost a lot.<br>  B. Most people like it.<br>  C. As long as it tastes good, people won't really care what they eat at your wedding.<br>  <br>  That said, go for it! The only thing I'd caution is that if you're going to have one kind, make sure everyone is a meat-eater if it has meats. Or, better yet, have a couple of different kind so that people feel they have choices. They'll be more pleased with a choice in case they don't eat meat, or want to eat meat with their pasta.|`|dItZAwI2aa	look, its your wedding and your budget. most ppl going to a wedding don't expect a steak or prime rib dinner. in what you have chosen even the pickiest of eaters will find something they will like.<br>  <br>  calm young lady, i understand pre-wedding jitters but put this one out of ur mind, ok.<br>  <br>  good luck, GOD bless and Congratulations!|`|eeaXYyCNaa	Its your wedding. And Lasagna is yummy.|`|7G4hisdzaa	No, I think it sounds good.  Lasagna is a popular choice.  If you have picky eaters coming, you may want to give them a heads up, but who doesn't like lasagna?  :)<br>  We are doing a buffet with a bunch of apps.  If you are trying to stay in budget you could try that option...I think you're good with the lasagna though.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	nah I'd love that. Keep it simple!  I hate when people have really fancy food for weddings, it always tastes nasty and no one ever cleans their plates.<br>  <br>  Stick to the lasagna.  Is it possible to have a choice between meat and cheese lasagna?  That would be about the only choice I'd offer.|`|e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	Everyone is on a budget so if you don't have enough money, postpone the wedding and save.  You should have a choice at your reception but if you are having a small wedding/reception I guess that would be fine.  I would prefer a choice if I was a guest though.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	the ediquite is usually to have 2 meat selections and 1 vegetarian selection to have meals for all types of people. did you ask around seeing if anyone is a vegetarian or doesnt like lasagna?|`|PAZWfnFtaa	Lasagna's great!  Those who don't eat meat or don't like lasagna can have your bread and salad and cake.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	HECK no, sounds tasty, "I" personally think when people serve weird stuff at their wedding it's like...well...weird, am i invited?

QSL8kwzXaa	Believe it or not, words do not begin to describe how well I understand your situation. Everything is basically dead-on for me besides the fact that my dad is not in the military, he is not in another state, I do not have a step-sister and I get to live with my dad on the weekends.<br>  I would try asking your mother why she is acting this way towards you. She's your mother, she shouldn't be treating you in this manner. Tell her that if things don't change soon, you just might be willing to go live with your dad for a while. Believe me, I would do the same thing, however my dad cannot support my brother and I financially, so I am stuck living with my mother. Take your opportunity and try to make the best of it.|`|7342BXehaa	well, i have the same experince, i mow live with my aunt<br>             connect with your dad, see if he wants you, look up everything [your school, public libracy, crime rate ...] come up with a comvining arguement, if you need help more on this subject email me, just click on my name|`|VUfT35UQaa	Be honest with her, and you are lucky, my mum is the same, you could have been describing her, she treats me with no respect.

Good luck and I hope all turns out well for you.

Don't hinge your self-esteem on it.

It's about his daughter not the two of you.|`|BJERgbM5aa	It is YOU who should be asking the father to attend.  For the daughters happiness.  If he still refuses, he's an idiot and it gives me a glimpse of why the divorce.  If you have a son or a favorite nephew or even your brother, that would be good too.  Good Luck to all.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Ideally he should put his feelings about you aside since it's his daughter's wedding and it's an important day for her. Maybe you two can agree to not say anything to each other. But if he won't see reason, then I'm sure it's fine to have another person or yourself give her away.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	he needs to realize this wedding is not about him and you, its about your daughter and her fiance<br>  <br>  HE needs to put aside whatever nonsense he has going on in his head.  he is making your daughters day about some nonsense that happend 20 years ago.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Of course you can.  I think a mother deserves it more than a father (I mean, who went through labour?) lol.<br>  <br>  I'm having both of my parents do it together.<br>  <br>  Also, if she doesn't want anyone she CAN walk down alone.  That is acceptable too, but I am sure she'd love you to do it.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	You can give her away if your daughter wants that. This is something to talk to her about, she knows whether she'd be okay with you giving her away or if there is another father-type figure in her life she would rather have there.|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	i think your husband is in the wrong here<br>  he should be civil and realize that a daughter probably wants both of her parents there<br>  sorry he's giving you the grief<br>  <br>  i would ask your daughter what she wants<br>  <br>  perhaps the dad can walk her down the aisle but not stay for the reception? that way you can still go to the reception and whoop it up<br>  <br>  it's doubtful that you'd even have to speak to him (if it wasn't a good idea) at the service.<br>  <br>  that way she could have both of you there|`|c27920620869d3d5b40c4f7c78b6b42aaa	try calling him, and asking him if for one day you can put your differences aside for the sake of your daughter having a happy wedding.  Tell him that this day isn't about you, or him but it's about you both showing up to show your love and support for your daughter and her choices. I've seen this work for several couples and everyone ended up coming to the wedding in the end. <br>  <br>  If this doesn't work, I would have a close male give her away. A brother? Uncle? Cousin? Grandfather? Anyone who is close in her life.|`|Bt1D1wWuaa	Dad should be ashamed of himself for being so petty...20 yrs ago!  He really needs to get over himself and think about his daughter!!!  If he is adamant, then absolutely MOM, you should have the honors of walking your daughter down the isle. In fact, you should really be the first choice, considering the dad's response.  I definitely can relate because I have been divorced for 12 yrs now and my ex sounds just like him!  P.S.  My parents were divorced and my mom took care of me by herself since I was 5 but my father was still in my life but I asked my  mom first if she wanted to walk me down the isle and asked her what she thought about both her and my dad walking me down and she agreed and all went well.|`|8c7cc680a9dfdc46cf7a06e1622558bbaa	That is so sad that her father cannot put aside any differences for one day to be at his daughters wedding. It is very selfish too.<br>  <br>  I think that your daughter should choose who she wants to walk her down the aisle. I think weddings are so customizable these days, no one will really think much of it if someone else other than her father walked her down.<br>  <br>  I think it would be wonderful for you, the mother, to walk her down. I really think anyone important in her life could do it. Or like other people said, she can walk alone as well.<br>  <br>  I am actually thinking about my fiance and I walking down the aisle together. Unfortunately I doubt my family will even come. So it is either that or I walk alone (which I don't mind doing at all).  <br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|1M90Aoytaa	She can have who ever SHE wants - i think its unfair of her fatehr to say no but its up to her - she can have you or a male freind or relative - these days both is common with more divorces more people havesomeone otehr than their father give them away|`|ZVcFFeEoaa	You could and should definitely give her away.

Good luck|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Sure you can, it's not written in stone, it's a tradition but that's all.|`|AA10086844	Of course you could give her away!  that would be fantastic!  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dpk9n2SSaa	I am so sorry for your daughter and for her father. He will regret missing his daughter's wedding. You have my respect and admiration. Yes, it is fine for you to walk your daughter down the aisle and give her away. A male relative can do this, too, but I bet your daughter would prefer for you to do it. Ask her. If the two of you are close, I am pretty sure that is what she will choose. I have seen it done before and it is really a beautiful symbol of love between a mother and her daughter. Best wishes on your daughter's wedding.|`|9ec35143f058d939ec20e181bffccf95aa	Hi There, I know how stressful it can be for you and your daughter when it comes to absent and stubborn fathers..I'm a professional wedding officiate and I have had Mother's walk their daughters down the Aisle several times...There is nothing wrong with that...Go ahead and do it..<br>  Rev. Marilyn|`|MVHGnU59aa	I think you definitely could give her away! I've been to weddings where both parents have given the bride away, I don't see why just the mother can't, particularly when the FOB isn't available -and sounds like a jerk!- <br>  <br>  If you didn't want to, talk to her about who she would like. I've seen big brothers and uncles and step dads....|`|DchAJvVqaa	i haven't spoken to my father in years and he and that whole side of the family will not be there,   i have thought to have my step dad walk me down but when it comes down to it, my grand father has been in my life since day one and has taken the role of father so i will walk down with him, he will be 83 when we walk down... i think it will be really special..  :)|`|c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	There is no right or wrong way, and I wouldn't even want her dad there if he's that selfish and ignorant to prefer missing his daughter's wedding. <br>  <br>  You can give her away, she can walk herself, she can have anyone she wants to walk with her.|`|iGTIFmTLaa	It is perfectly fine for you to give her away! A friend of mine had her Mom give her away and it  was beautiful.
lTNcvqyHaa	Chemistry is chemistry - if it is real it never changes.<br>   If you like someone then tell them, if you don't like them then be kind but truthful - always be a gentleman. Use tact and say the words you would like to hear if someone were breaking it off with you. Never, crapon never bullshit or lie.<br>  <br>  If you like  - go get - you may never regret. Love is a big and real deal.<br>  <br>  If you are just playing then think very carefully about hurting another person.|`|f2fyXyulaa	I agree with the one that says you should be honest cause you really should. If you act like things have changed and tell that person that, you never know what could have become of you two...|`|oijAnax4aa	i agree w/ the second side. if you continue trying to be friends, when you want to be more, you'll always be left with that incomplete feeling, and you'll feel like you're jst not getting what you want no matter what. if two ppl had serious chemistry, then i believe it will still be there. so i believe they should express their true feelings, and see if it will work out. if it doesn't, then it's experience, something to learn from.

My husband and i done it all on ￡4,000.00 but i know friends who done it on silly money, like 25-30k. So all depends if you are materalistic or not. The day for me meant i became my partners wife, not about, look at the big wedding cake, or the big posh car.....them things are not important in life. Since the wedding i have lost my father and my husband was diagnosed with a brain tumour, so this proved to me life isn't about material things, its about being happy. So even if you decided to have a small do, in a registry office and a little party after then thats all good. Don't be silly with your money, it is only one day out of the rest of your life.|`|SaAQZiG4aa	depends you have a huge wedding costing 10,000+ but don't freak out cause on helpin plan a good wedding you could spend about 2,000 and it be pretty nice look for drawings they will help pay for things good luck|`|fNgv2FeRaa	￡100 in a registry office.<br>  <br>  The other costs depends how materialistic you are.|`|HyAvpatCaa	depends - in vegus u can have an on-the-road marriage for ￡5, but for us average people its about ￡5000 - ￡14000|`|deZArjX7aa	I heard that the average cost of a wedding these days is around $30,000.|`|GdjfU5Saaa	it depends, whether you get married in vegas or have a 500 people wedding in a pipe organ church.|`|KIZVWREHaa	I would say between 3-20 grand but that is not including dresses and tuxes .|`|2Hmtwgpaaa	Depends on what you want,big hotel or wedding abroad,or registry.They all vary in cost.|`|03mWWuhoaa	depends if your doing big white traditional wedding or simple registary office . .|`|pjYn6PbCaa	Cost??

How much do you think a marriage ring should cost?  $100, 300, 3,000? (that's another cost)<br>  <br>  But, if you want to have new clothes, a reception, and even a honeymoon, that could cost thousands of dollars more.<br>  <br>  Some people spend over $20,000 on one marriage.<br>  Unfortunately, 1/2 of marriages do not last even 10 years, so it may not be money well spent.<br>  <br>  There is no correlation between amount of money spent and longevity of the marriage.|`|BNCpLcLoaa	Which country are you in and do you want it in a church, reg office or somewhere private?<br>  <br>  I got married  last year in a beautul registry office and that cost ￡45<br>  Outfits off ebay for myself, husband and daughter cost ￡50<br>  Buffet meal after for 30 people cost ￡150<br>  ￡100 for two wedding rings.<br>  <br>  so about ￡345 in total. :D <br>  <br>  And it was the most beautiful day.<br>  <br>  So I guess it depends if you wanna waste money or make it just about the two of you getting married. :D<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|FL2nfCSXaa	depends on where you go. now if you go to vegas or something like that and get married in one of those wedding chapels, just know that its alot more inexpensive than doing a huuuuuge wedding that you and your fiance plan for.sending out wedding invitations,having it catered, finding a location large enough for all of your family and friends to attend....just thinking about it is exhausting,lol|`|aac9e99cfbd47367e4f29a390df5846caa	you just go down to the court house, it depends on what state you live in, and pay about 50-100 for the lisence then you got to see what they will charge if you do it there, that is the cheapest, It cost way more to get a devorce so make sure its right if you are worried about money now|`|t4DP30r6aa	Depends on the wedding you want. Photos are the most expensive. There are alot of places you can catch. I had a destination wedding in Hawaii.. It was like 6000 dollars cheaper than it would have been if I got married in my home state.... And that includes my honeymoon! If you do a destination wedding you can look them up online.

kUE3Ddktaa	I bought a bridesmaid dress from J.Crew. I was nervous about ordering it without trying it on, but I've purchased other dresses from their actual store before and was fairly sure of my size - if you're not, go in and try on whatever's around in the store, so you can have an idea of what size you need. My dress fit well enough that it didn't alterations - they're made to fit like normal clothes, which is a blessing! <br>  <br>  My dress was very well-made and I've worn it several times since the wedding. It looks and feels like a high-quality piece of clothing, which is more than I can say for most of the dreck at David's Bridal. You get what you pay for. I'm not married but I do think they make beautiful bridal gowns - very classic and elegant.<br>  <br>  The J.Crew website (under "Help > Alterations") says they only do alterations for J.Crew credit card purchases on certain items (pants, jackets, and skirts) - not special occasion dresses. But their clothes are straightforward. You should be able to take you dress to any seamstress to have it hemmed or tucked a little bit.<br>  <br>  This is my bridemaid's dress (which fit in my normal dress size):<br>  <a href="http://www.jcrew.com/AST/Browse/WomenBrowse/Women_Shop_By_Category/dresses/weddingsparties/PRDOVR~96454/96454.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcrew.com/AST/Browse/WomenBro...</a><br>  <br>  Here is their policy on in-store alterations:<br>  <a href="http://www.jcrew.com/help/alteration.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcrew.com/help/alteration.jsp</a>|`|AA10378447	No, I've seen them around, though. <br>  <br>  That is a big gamble - having to try it on and trust their measurements without being able to see how the gown looks on it. The look and fit you see on the model isn't always going to exactly look like that IRL. You can get it and just hope that a seamstress can work with the adjustments; however, they don't appear to be of the best quality, which is why they can sell them so cheaply.<br>  <br>  The girl I know who was considering one had heard that she shouldn't do it, but she contemplated it, and then decided not to, for the very reason you state: can't even try before she invests the money.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	I bought my bridesmaids dresses from J Crew and I couldn't be happier with them.  My bridesmaids all got their typical dress size and the J Crew dresses were perfect.  None of them had to exchange sizes or have theirs altered.  The dresses are very well made and I am happy with the purchase.  I had a 20% off coupon and I opened a J Crew card for another 10% off.  It worked out very well in the end!

A cheater wont freely admit to cheating.. they always deny it.. but denial doesnt make them innocent, it just makes them a liar as well as a cheater.  I remember one time, when I had been feeling a bit suspicious for a few weeks, my husband (now ex-husband) came home from work late and I smelt perfume on his clothes.  I queried it, he said I imagined it.. but then few seconds later our 5 year old son came into the room to say hi to his dad and gave him a hug, and said "you smell like a girl dad".  So yeah, so much for me imagining it right.  There were other suspicious circumstances, and he just kept on denying, denying, denying, making me feel a fool for questioning him all the time.  Until my (supposed) best friend told me they were having an affair.  So now, I always trust my intuition.

LJLyNsmKaa	You did good, you definitely need to give him a consequence. You can decide what that is ahead of time and let him know what you expect of him and explain it clearly. Ask him if he understands & has any questions so its clear he understand what you expect. Let him know that behavior is not tolerated and follow through if occurs. Be firm, but kind.

Flowers are a must at any wedding no matter how big or how small. Get something that doesn't cost a lot like carnations and borrow vases from family members. Tie them off with a big bow.<br>  <br>  Also maybe some champagne? or sparkling cider? Something to make it feel festive and a little less like a cheap wedding. <br>  <br>  and finally dress up any tables with table cloths, even some cheap cloth will make a big difference in making the wedding feel pretty. <br>  <br>  It also depends on where she is getting married.

CM1dfztQaa	It sounds like your sister is still dealing with a lot of anger issues from her bad relationship. If he was physically AND mentally abusive, she may still feel like she has to be in survival mode. <br>  <br>  Sometimes when women go through abusive situations, they come out blaming those they love for not saving them. She probably doesn't even know that's what she's doing. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, she's taking it out on the wrong people. She needs professional counseling to help her through her anger. <br>  <br>  I know it doesn't seem that way now, but counseling may be the best way to get her out. It will take a little longer, but the counselor will help push her into learning how to be on her own.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to take these steps, then call the police and have her removed. Mom can tell them that she came to visit and refused to leave. It's a really hard way to go, but it's effective.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Call the police and have her forcibly removed and get a restraining order.|`|8K3IucU3aa	put all her stuff outside when next time she's gone. if she calls the government you can just deny that she was there. she's being very ungrateful and doesn't deserve the kindness that she's getting. no one should ever treat their mother that way. i don't know where she got that bitchy attitude but that could be a good lesson to learn.|`|EeabLB5eaa	Write her a long letter explaing what she did wrong and why it was wrong.

Why does he always have to make the first move?  When you're at Church say hi to him yourself.  Take the intiative and call him more often.  It's not a big deal; instead of asking this question you shouldn't have casually brought it up in conversation.|`|sxJgu3C9aa	Define YOUR relationship TOGETHER, though an open dialog.<br>  Express what you FEEL for him, describe what is confusing YOU, listen to his answers and take a decision together.<br>  If not together...take the decision according to yourself only.|`|4tY6gfF6aa	i would just tell him, hey maybe we can hang out when you get this message? just come over okay? :]|`|J9sUlpX8aa	tl;dr<br>  <br>  answer: just follow your heart!|`|tjsRaRiHaa	i don't know|`|2dfcb0af05ab08e87d9cad31876c3846aa	It's possible that he just sees you as a friend.

5HYbJmbcaa	No. Alot of people feel the same way, mostly because (not saying this is you though) They don't want their mom's new boyfriend taking her away from them. If this is the way you feel, be sure to talk to your mom about wanting time with her, and be sure to talk to your mom and her boyfriend about how you feel about your relationship. Most mom's will go back a step if they know their kid doesn't feel comfortable with their boyfriend. Maybe you will get used to him, maybe not. Just be sure to talk to people about how you feel and ask them for advice, especially your relatives and close friends.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Yes.

You could find a home for women, and temporarily stay there. Get a restraining order for you and your baby so he cannot come with in sertain km of you two. Research and find a lawyer in your area that either goes probono or on a lower pay, and file for custody of the baby.

The process takes roughly one hour, and there are often people - like law students - available to help you. The Order can (and probably will) protect your child if granted. The application requires that you tell your story in writing, which you aptly did here.<br>  <br>  The order will at first last 2 weeks, and subsequently can be extended by 6 months at a time. It can protect your car, your house, your child, your place of work, whatever. Whenever the order is violated - if he even comes within 100 yards of you - call the police and he will be immediately arrested. <br>  <br>  Alternatively, and a worse route - if he beats you up, call the police. When they arrest them, you can get something like a TRO - a Criminal Protective Order (CPO). However, the TRO process is both easier and pre-emptive (e.g. can be done before further abuse occurs).<br>  <br>  If you are in hard times and need further legal advice, call the local Legal Aid or Victim's Advocate, which can provide free or extremely low-cost legal advice and lawyers. These should be in the phone book.<br>  <br>  This is extreme abuse that is threatening your life. I don't even want to tell you how abusive situations all-too-often end. For your child's sake, go get a TRO and then move in with your mom, sister, friend, ANYONE in the meantime. I know you feel you can't start all over again but you can, you are strong.<br>  <br>  Regarding visitation, that is way in the future. A TRO may prevent him from having visitation at all (if you stipulate that when you apply). Deal with custody once you've done the first, hard part: getting a TRO and getting out.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I'll keep you in my prayers - <br>  <br>  A law student|`|c13c6210f8a179b06da48f1ce1d09e1aaa	LEAVE HIM- NOW.<br>  <br>  The longer you leave it the harder and worse it will get.<br>  <br>  My Mum and Dad (although they don't have a violent relationship between the two of them) don't have a great relationship at all and my Mum was going to leave him when I was a baby over something that happened (I won't go into it all) but cut a long story short- she is now still wanting to leave him (years and years later) and she feels she is 'stuck'.<br>  <br>  This is the problem the longer you 'ignore' a problem the worse it becomes and gets out of control....<br>  <br>  Try any of these you can/feel will help:<br>  <br>  1) Tell someone close family/friend you trust and ask for help<br>  2) Call a helpline for advice<br>  3) Contact a local charity for women and womens refuge for confidential advice<br>  4) Leave when he is not around and take your son with you- its obvious that when you try to leave with him around he will not let you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, God bless,|`|jqsu76T5aa	hun<br>  i would call<br>  the Steve Wilkos show<br>  <br>  trust me im not joking! he will deff help you ... and hell do something that he wont touch u ever again,<br>  his website it<br>  <br>  www.stevewilkos.com<br>  <br>  <br>  please call. wut u wrote made me cry.<br>  please clal him and ask for his help. nothing will happen to you! and he wont hurt you anymore=[[.<br>  <br>  <br>  ie frogot  to say ur kid from age of 0-8 learns wutever goes around the house. hell learn all these and do the same thing. sooo DO IT FOR YOUR OWN SON
S3Bd3JIDaa	i would ask...i know when i was making invitations for one of my friends she only put one name on the invitation because she didn't want to be rude and put "and guest"<br>  sometimes there is no "and guest" and people get offended by that.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	It is rude to bring a date if you are not invited to bring a guest. Unless the invitation says "Karen and guest" or "Karen (plus guest)" or something like that, the invitation only extends to you.<br>  <br>  Couples on a budget have to trim where they can - sometimes this means not letting single friends bring a buddy. If you don't want to go by yourself, just decline the invitation and send a card/gift. If you do want to go, talk with some of your other invited friends and see if a group wants to travel together.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Only you are invited. If you were allowed to bring a guest, the invite would indicate that. Since it didn't, you attend by yourself. It's also rude to call her up and ask her if you can. Weddings are not cheap and most people can't afford to invite random strangers. <br>  <br>  As for going alone, people do it all the time and they have no problem enjoying themselves. Do you ever attend other events by yourself and are you able to have a good time? If so, there is no reason you can't do the same at this wedding.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	What does the RSVP card say? When I sent out invitations, the reply card included, Will Not Attend, Will Attend and a place to put number of guests. I didn't have a clue if some single people I invited had a significant other right then or would have one by the wedding and not everyone does. You could also contact the bride and ask her if it's alright to bring a date.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	Yes, it is rude to bring a date.  If there is no indication that you are permitted to bring a guest, then you can't invite one along.  If everyone did that - they wouldn't be able to budget their reception!  While it makes sense to take someone when the wedding is somewhere else, you just can't.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Yes, it is rude to bring a date. The thing is that budgets are often a factor in who people invite. <br>  <br>  At my wedding, one uncle brought an extra child that caused a big hullabaloo with another uncle who thought we purposely didn't put a chair for him.|`|aXYiOskmaa	unless it says"and guest" you are expected to come alone.it would be rude to bring another without the invite cause they may have to worry about cost. however, if you call her and ask, maybe it'll be okay.|`|FP8gUzMaaa	NO you cannot bring a date and YES it is rude for you to bring a date.<br>  <br>  Keep something in mind... weddings are expensive. You usually have to rent the hall per number of guests attending and you have to foot a meal per head. If you bring a date (especially since she did not say you could) now she'll have to take into consideration that that's more money to pay...<br>  <br>  This may not seem like a big deal to you (what's one more person, huh?) but if everyone did this, think of how many uninvited guests would arrive! <br>  <br>  Either toughen it out and go to the wedding alone, or don't go at all. Do NOT bring a date though.|`|qRIMM2ycaa	Ask your friend.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying to ask for special permission to bring someone. I'm saying to ask for clarification.<br>  People get so bent out of shape over the specific nuance of wording of wedding invites, and most of the time it's for no reason.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Simple answer: no you can't. It would be HORRIBLY rude to show up with someone.  If it were my wedding, I'd ask you BOTH to leave.<br>  She's paying at LEAST $20 per person for dinner, PLUS booze.  I'd definitely ask both of oyu to leave.|`|ZVcFFeEoaa	Yes this is true if it doesn't say ''and guest'' then they expect you to show up alone unless you can actually call and speak to the bride and groom and ask if its alright, they would tell you yes or no.|`|SgQcb849aa	You can't bring a date is only has your name|`|vhuqAqNdaa	Ring her, ask her, if you pay for your date is it okay if they can come.|`|seU9VwIJaa	If it doesn't say plus guest on the invite, you go alone. They invite who they budget for.|`|tb0NMaooaa	does it say 'and guest"? if not, your to go alone, if you chose to go.|`|dpk9n2SSaa	Sorry, but if the invitation does not say "and Guest," you cannot bring anyone. It is a budget thing. It is considerate when the bride invites a single and puts "and Guest" but if their budget is not big, it means they cannot afford to pay extra. Don't worry. You will probably not be the only single there. Maybe you will meet Mr. Right! Good luck.|`|L0LUGdc3aa	People show up to parties with uninvited dates frequently, however, with dinner and seating arrangements, it would be out of the question to invite someone she may or may not know. When people wed, they like big fabulous parties, but I'm pretty sure they only want their closest friend and family around, not just acquaintances.|`|BeSlRy2baa	If it only has your name on it you should call her and ask if you can bring a date. I right now am planning my wedding and she may not have ordered enough food drink and cake for more people. If you don't want to ask then I wouldn't bring a date.|`|OYLzTdBcaa	well it depends.,,<br>  if your close to the person who invited you,maybe you can surely he or she will undertand:)<br>  but if your not close to the person<br>  then go alone:)|`|0LzEU3znaa	If the invitation ONLY has your name on it, you should NOT bring a date.
BLaEQfdDaa	wow buddy we are both in the same boat, after 5 years my wife suddenly told me she didn't love me anymore, I have been alone for about 3 months now, I am just waiting for the divorce papers to come in the mail. I hate to say this but being at you mom house is the worst place to be, I could of gone back home to but I knew it would drive me crazy, so I still live in our apt, but I have remodel, made it more me her things are her but packed up, just haven't got them to storage yet. I live in the city, walk alot, just go walking, exercise you have to start living for youself now, I go window shop, just keep my mind of things. yes I hurt she turn around and walk out of our marriage and I just have to live with that, nothing I can do to change it. do you have any hobbies you can start up again.just the little things to keep you busy!!! good luck my friend!!!|`|94b8KImYaa	Find something you enjoy doing and at the same times keeps your mind occupied. Read, paint anything you like to do and never had the time. Learn a new language, etc|`|6wzQhsIkaa	Well, you NEED to get out of the house, that is for sure. Are there any museums in your area? Join a group of some sort. Take a class...anything but sit around and feel sorry for yourself.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Video games. If you try, you can fill all your time outside of work with them.|`|IPb9zjL2aa	Yah im in the same boat myself,  10 year marriage. im 34 and feel like its kinda late to be getting back in the game.  I guess im a pretty attractive guy i have women looking at me often, but i honestly forgot how to talk to them. <br>  <br>  Anyways i spend most of my time on Self Improvment things, Reading books about women and relationships and working out, when im not with my son.   And trying to help people with issue on Yahoo Answers that i have gone though myself.   Do things for self improvment and along will come the courage to get over your feelings and move on.|`|Ub1IOPsraa	First of all, get some religion.  You may not be religious, it won't hurt you to learn some things about God, Jesus Christ, and the Gospel.  You are down in the dumps, out of circulation, over 30 years old, and you haven't figured out what life is really about.  Go to Church and meet some good people.  The LDS is Church would be a good start.  The Church is not a hotel for the Saints-its a hospital for the Sinners.  <br>  <br>  Secondly, you could go to your local community center and see what type of activities are happening.  Your local newspaper also has a weekly activities update about what is happening in your town.  The Church also has programs and events for singles over 30.  Good place to meet people, whether male or female.  Thirdly, volunteer for the good of the community in which you live.  I am certain there are things you can do, and talents that you possess that can be a benefit to others.  The Church has these things as well, and they are always short on volunteers.<br>  <br>  Now, the first thing that needs to happen is for you to want to do any of this stuff.  People won't find you at your mom's house.  You got to go where your services are needed.  Pick yourself up by the boot straps and go!  God bless you and good luck to you.  Your success depends on YOU!|`|iizKx4Bvaa	going to  book clubs and museums and parks. pretty much dont cost a thing. You can socialize at a bus station if you want to. book clubs might just surprise the hell outta you. Girls love to go there. Movies do the matinees you might also be surprised. Church althoug you are not religious is a great way to meet them gals too. Yes lawd.lol. You have to go out and talk to people. First of all learn to be alone within yourself and like and accept who and what you are. Head up chin up forward march. Acqwuaint yourself with yourself too. Might as well get something out of your time alone. Your wounds will heal given time.|`|bDWDZ63Iaa	Get it together. Move the hell out of your moms house!! Go to the doctor and work on your back!!!

It's a very nice and comfortable car. I'm so happy it's a car and not a truck lol...|`|dxeOlRBfaa	i would totally choose the pink one! cuz it would be a "rare" car cuz i bet no one at ur school or that u know will have a bright pink mustang. plus wherevr u go people will look at u drive by! oh its such a cute car pick that one!!!!!!!!|`|lveC3ArHaa	b or d...

You can't drive it yet, and chances are, you'll crash it at least once in the first month alone.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying it to be mean, I'm just stating a fact.

AA10065812	It sounds like she is just messing with your head, which is abusive, so take the lead and file.  Are there any children?  If there is, there are steps you need to be taking.<br>  <br>  I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.  Also, learn how to make sure the judge is being balance is his decision by using Court Watch.<br>  <br>  Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.  <br>  <br>  Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  You’re that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  Take the time to learn what you can and should do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/DadsHouse/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...</a><br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.parentalalienation.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentalalienation.org/</a>|`|94b8KImYaa	She seems to be playing with you with her little e-mails and this is cruel. See it as a done deal that she wants a divorce and that you will agree to it - and move on. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|e1oky4jSaa	She obviously wants to move on. I think you should really just put her out of your heart the best you can. For whatever reason, she does not want to reconcile; and you are hurting yourself the longer you stay in "limbo". Just finalize the divorce as quickly as possible. You will love again some day. Sorry if this is not the answer you wanted to hear.|`|Ub1IOPsraa	Cut the string and move on.  There is nothing that says you can't file for divorce first.  I would imagine if you did file first, I'll bet you'll hear from her.  As long as you are in limbo, there is nothing forcing her to make a decision.  How do I know you ask?  Been there and done that.|`|fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	Sorry to say it, but there is no limbo here - she wants a divorce. She may be dragging her feet about it, but she made it pretty clear that she doesn't want to be with you. Sorry. You can file for divorce yourself, you don't have to wait for her to do that.|`|AA10976951	Maybe instead of waiting around on her to send you divorce papers, maybe you should surprise her with some of your own.  It's time to move on...send her divorce papers.  She obviously likes keeping you hanging by a thread, cut that thread and get on with your life.|`|4TqUgtpzaa	It seems as though she has moved on. Maybe call her or ask to meet with her and have a heart to heart. Ask her where she is going with her life and if you are apart of that vision. If not, move on from this. It is easier said than done, but it is not fair for you to sit around and wait for her to change. Find someone who will love you and not leave you hanging. Good luck!|`|aeLyiRczaa	Unless you cheated on her, she is wrong, plainly put.  I am all for hanging in there and trying to make it right.  But honestly, she is playing you.  File yourself.  That just might wake her *** up too.  Right now, she has you like a puppy on a leash.  She gets to do her own thing and knows you are right there if she wants you.  Look, do not let her do it.  She needs to realize she has as much to lose as you do.  No, wait, she has more to lose.  You are better then she is so she risks more.  And if she gambles wrongly, let her pay the price for it.  No women does you any more a favor by being with you then you do her by being with her.  And dude, she does not love you or she would not act this way.  Face that now.  Yes, it hurts, but hey, the sooner you deal with it and let past it, the sooner the pain will be over and behind you.|`|hNKcAY7laa	If your wife hasnt been with you for almost a year then i would say it is a pretty good indication she has moved on and maybe she is just keeping you there as a back up plan incase it all goes wrong,thats not fair and you desrve better than that.M ove on yourself and i know there are plenty of people out there that would love to be with someone so commited like you put this behind you and you will never look back.|`|Ncad6d57aa	It seems like she is moving on... if 'life is good' for her then she obviously isn't missing you. Check to see if she filed for divorce at the court house, if not... either sign you guys up for counseling or contact her and ask her what's going on. Don't just sit there, because you'll never know.|`|4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	She sounds like she is messing with you because you are letting her.  MOVE ON...she won't like that too much and don't contact her.  Sometimes we don't want to let some people go but dude it's been almost a year?  Don't do that to yourself.  I've been there, done that and regret being such a dumba** for someone who didn't deserve it.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Y9ZJqKHHaa	I know how you feel. but you see, sometimes, letting go, no matter how hard it is, is the best way to go if you would want an already sour relationship turn better...especially if you both have kids.|`|oqQdutsfaa	Depends on what you did to make your wife want a divorce!|`|tKdNpK7Caa	I am in the EXACT situation and it's almost scary reading this because it's like I"m talking to him. Minus the emails and the conversations that is our situation and to be honest it's nothing but games. She may have been trying to call and figure out how you stand because of the lack of your involvement with her and SHOWING her that you love her and maybe don't want it to end the way it is. <br>  <br>  You have to keep in mind that with divorce both parties are extremely hurt...even the one who is filing for the divorce. If you really love her and don't want to move on and be without her you need to show that to her in everyway...now is the time to fight for her like you never have before even though in your heart you may feel she filed so it's over and there's nothing i can do.<br>  <br>  Women are very emotional beings and we love to hear and feel how much we are loved. The minute a guy doesn't do this or show in any way that he doesn't care for her or NEED her...he is dust.
0wBUph1Taa	Be yourself. Be confident. Don't try to be anything your not. Don't do anything to him/for him if your not ready. Be strong and independent but love him and lean on him. And if he doesn't love you for you dump him.|`|BWB4PoYdaa	The best & fastest way to a mans heart is through his stomach... truuuuuust me lol I learned that bit of advice from my mom, grandma & especially my husbands grandma<br>  <br>  You should find out his favorite meal & cook it from scratch for him and then afterwards give him a massage cuz guys like 2 be pampered too. And another important thing you should always keep up is your appearance... if he's ur boyfriend thas important. Too many girls get comfy and let themselves go after getting into a relationship. That's a factor I've learnd from having so many guy friends who are unfortunately unfaithful because they feel like their gf doesn't care enough to brush her hair.<br>  <br>  There's goin 2 b a lot of contradicting opinions but sometimes the truth hurts.

2Mmhr1aNaa	If the space is small, the ipod dock with fill it just fine.  <br>  <br>  I was at a wedding where they did that, and the one piece of advice I have is this: do not just let it run.  Have someone you trust, who knows music make changes if necessary.  If you have too many oldies in the beginning so grandma can have fun.. people will get bored, so you have to forward to the new stuff.  Put more than you'll need in the line up, so if you have to skip a bunch, you'll have enough,|`|HMvXkR6Faa	The aux. cord is what you really need to connect the ipod to speakers.  You may want to look into renting speakers for the evening (which is way cheaper than hiring a DJ).<br>  <br>  If you rent good quality speakers you can plug n your ipod and the sound quality should be pretty good.  You should also ask the equipment place you rent from about the best cords to use, just so everything sounds the best quality possible ... they could probably even supply you with the best cord to use if your cable isn't the proper one.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

It's more than just the size.  You can only do so much with a rod and a whole.  If you don't know how to work your organ and incorperate other things than just ramming your rod into something, then you don't know what your doing.  Caressing, touching, licking & kissing is needed just as much as some pole coming after me.

I'm not one to look down on someone for walking hand in hand with the person they love no matter what color.  I can only guess and I'd guess that it is because they were taught to think it is wrong.  If you put a group of small children into a room they will all play together and not judge or criticize another child because of their color.  They also could care less if one or more of the children are overweight.  It means nothing to them because they look deep into the person that they are playing with and determine if they are nice or not.  They don't judge them from their outer appearance.  But, as they grow older they are influenced by the adults in their lives and television.  We actually teach our children to think it is wrong by the messages we let them see on t.v. and in the magazines.  I think it is sad.  And to answer your question further... I think several people that "think" it is wrong really won't have a solid answer to back up their belief.  Many don't know "why?".  They just think it is the way it is supposed to be because that is what they were taught.  I hope you accept my apology for the ignorant ones.  Good luck in your relationship and God bless!|`|878524ca5e9e0d81e45cdc714f998088aa	People are uncomfortable with what they don't understand.

It's probably hard to ignore them at times, but just remember *they're* in the wrong. <br>  <br>  And as for people like zax_fl above - sorry, zax, but he's just justifying racism. You shouldn't date someone of another race because *other* people won't accept you? That's rubbish. The other people are in the wrong, not you.<br>  <br>  Feetal's attitude isn't much better. Would you have a problem with black men dating white women, Feetal? Did it ever occur to you that maybe those black women are just attracted to white men because of a strong "opposites attract" physical attraction they have - and nothing to do with thinking they're doing better. I find black women very attractive as a white man - how do you explain that according to your theory?  Sheesh. <br>  <br>  Love who you want to love - regardless of skin color (or gender for that matter) - and best of luck!

If you feel truly and deeply for a girl you cannot even conceive of being with anyone else but her. Therefor I do not believe it's love, not the real thing for sure,<br>  This is what I suggest you do. <br>  Date each of them individually for a period of at least three months. Get to know them better. That's how you give each of them a fair chance and you get focused, stop being all over the place, young man, it only leads to trouble.<br>  You also must ask yourself if you are truly ready to commit to one and only person right now. If the three ladies in question find out that they are not the only ones in your life,(Unless they know already and don't care), you might loose your chance to be with the one you really want.<br>  Tread carefully, and good luck,<br>  Irene|`|AA10993379	THATS WHY THE LADYS SHOULD NOT TRUST ANY MAN ON LINE|`|384436d14895b87238e4d6a65042186daa	whoever is gonna give it up first.....|`|42c1e5484a4084b4999958d36dd79361aa	i would say who gives the best head, there is nothing better than girl who knows how to suck|`|79a0f9d13710432c76e8132ebf68c9ceaa	which one is the last one you think about before you fall asleep and the first when you wake up?|`|1e2b3e2a32020bcfad61cb2852c3e627aa	the biggest breasts obviously..|`|30c556f6363f2f763ca2eb285043511eaa	why would you hurt 3 girls?? b/c you want to be so selfish!!

The one you can wake up to in the morning, makes you feel on top of the world, the one that you can sit up an talk to for hours an when its all said an done she doesn't judge you for what you are/have been going through.  When you look at her your heart an head start racing an you get your words mixed up.  The one that you are the most comfortable with.  Someone who you can play with an they won't get mad at you, the one that when life seperates you....you always know, she is still there, right where you left her waiting on you to make up your mind. Thats the girl you need, she will give you space, make you happy, love you , and be there for you emotionally and physically. The one who only cares about spending every day with you. You know she loves you when she takes forever to look her best for you, when she caresses your head while you lay on her lap, when she is not afraid to say 'I'm sorry', when her eyes light up everytime she sees you, when she calls you in the middle of the day just to say 'I love you', when she doesn't care about how much money you got in your wallet, when she's willing to change her plans for you, when she takes you home to meet her family, when she tells you much she cares about you and how lucky she is to have you every day.

Ve al psicólogo permite que te ayude. Necesitas estar bien para ver con claridad. Cuando te sientas mejor, reúnete con tus padres y diles todo lo que sientes. Es probable que no haya un final feliz inmediato. Si todavía dudas en hacerlo. Los psicólogos dicen que es bueno escribir una carta para cada uno de ellos en donde plasmes todo lo que les quieres decir. No es necesrio que se las des. Solo úsalas como un mecanismo para sacar fuera de ti todos los sentimientos que te hacen sentirte tan mal.<br>  Suerte!|`|ebf01c2c8868b2e5750a745814d8c779aa	pidele mucho a dios y solo el te ayudara por que creo no te debes meter en la relacion de tus papa pase lo qeu pase|`|09b9a1dbecc6545c0d7908a63ed72c04aa	Anímate, habla con el psicólogo seguro te ayudará, tus papás deben amarte pero están tan inmersos en sus problemas que no comprenden el gran da?o que están haciéndote.

Problemas entre ellos, desconfianza, tal vez alguna infidelidad y ya no se confian sólo están ahí por costumbre y por los hijos entre otras cosas. Como tu estás en esta situación y el mas afectado eres tu, intenta llevarlos a una cita de ayuda para parejas. No se cuanto tiempo lleven de casados pero muchas parejas se ven afectadas con el paso de los a?os. También está la carga y el estress del trabajo, de las responsabilidades.<br>  <br>  Mira yo llevaba 6 a?os con mi esposa y tenemos una ni?a de 3 a?os. Cuando nació la ni?a las responsabilidades cambiaron, ya no eramos ese par de muchachos que se la pasaba paseando, saliendo, disfrutando, de cine, de compras, de pasa dias entre otras cosas. Entonces comenzaron los problemas de quien hace que, de trabajar para asumir los gastos y ya no teniamos el tiempo para nosotros. Yo tuve que trabajar mas de lo normal para poder cubrir las deudas. Ella no trabajaba tiempo completo y tenia mucho tiempo libre y se sentia sola, aunque le pedí que se buscara un trabajo completo, ella no quería. Me enga?ó con otro pues tal vez él le hacia mas compa?ia que yo pues porque ella estaba libre la mayoría del tiempo. Cuando me enteré senti el enga?o y ya no volví a confiar en ella aunque la perdoné, no confié mas y sabes que por el resto de la relacción casi ni hablabamos, yo me sentia muy dolido, enga?ado y con coraje.<br>  <br>  Tuvimos que terminar, la ni?a también estaba sufriendo mucho, ya yo ni queria salir, ni la llevaba al parque a jugar. mi ex- se sentia sola, yo me sentia enga?ado. En fín todo fué un desastre y creo q deberias buscarle ayuda a tus padres si quieres verlos contentos, o que de una vez terminen. Será muy doloroso, pero con el tiempo sanarán sus heridas y quien sabe si hasta vuelven a enamorarse luego.|`|79e527722b5137b5858be90cc41034a5aa	la religion no tiene que ver nada, si tienes que decirle a tus papas lo que sea diselos, los papas de mi esposo se separararon y el lo tomo como debia ser ya que el no puede juntarlos si ellos no quieren porque ellos saben sus motivos, porque algunas veces uno ni sabe x q ellos asi deciden, solo que no te metan en medio, suerte y animo!!!|`|9c592f4e0e2bf1e823413e9e5c7f1482aa	no cari?o en este caso te dire no se trata de religiones ,,,Dios existe y es MARAVILLOSO no te metas en asuntos de religiones mi nene ,,,,Dios sabe por lo q estas pasando y en este caso es cuando mas pero mas serca de Dios debes de estar y q el junte nuevamente a tus padres ORA mira q eso es bueno pero haslo con "FE" ....<br>  y con ellos te dire q tienes q sentarlos y decirles lo q tu sientes desahogate llora delante de ellos saca todo eso q llebas por dentro ....ellos en estos momentos no tiene nada mas en sus mentes sus problemas y no se dan cuenta del da?o y el sufrimiento q tu llevas por dentro y no se trata de gritarles ,,,<br>  mejor sientalos y diles .......bueno yo quiero hablar con ustedes 2 y quiero decirles todo lo q tengo en mi corazon ,,,,y les dices todo lo q tienes y cual es la pelea q se tienen q ya demasiado tiempo asi,,,,<br>  y si mi consejo te vale busca ayuda habal con el psicologo de tu escuela ,,,,y no hagas caso a aquellos q te dicen q el psicologo es para locos ...no no no ellos tratan de buscar la solucion a los problemas asi el psicologo tambien los cite a ellos y les de su buen consejo,..,,,y si q lo necesitan ,,,y comentaselo a algun familiar tuyo y q tambien te ayude.,,,,,,y sibre todas las cosas busca ayuda de DIOS mira q el jamas de los jamases te dejara solo no dudes de tu CREADOR nunca....<br>  ojala mi consejo te sirva de algo ,,,sientalos y habla con ellos saca todo eso q llevas por dentro ,,,,,y no dejes nada en tu corazon sacalo q ellos sepan lo q tu sientes ......<br>  me buscas para ver como te fue :: yadi429@hotmail.com<br>  suerte mi nene|`|LYYytBYxaa	lo mejor k puedes hacer es hablar kon ellos y decirles komo t sientes, han d estar pasando x tiempos dificiles, tienes k saber kuales son sus problemas enterarte d las kosas k pasan kon tu familia sean buenas o malas, aveces las parejas se dejan d amar y es inevitable nosotros no podemos obligar a nuestros padres a k esten juntos x k lo mas seguro es k la situacion empeore talves lo mejor es k se separen...pero no ai k adelarntarse a los hechos es por eso k necesitas ablar kon ellos y saber k es lo k pasa para k estes mas trankilo... y si necesitas ablar kon alguien seria bueno k fueras kon el psikologo ellos sabrian darte muchos konsejos... d echo io estudiare para ser psicologa jeje, bueno habla con tus papas y mucha suerte!!|`|ff3d85b4a5542c0c84de72fdfc719200aa	necesitas ayuda y a alguien que te escuche!!! es muy feo que te hagan esto o que ellos mismos se hagan esto sin darse cuenta que te estan lastimando!!! por que no se separan?? vos no hablas con ellos?? si no podes hablar con ellos estaria bueno que puedas hacerlo con el consejero de tu escuela que seguramente te va a escuchar!!! trata de apoyarte en tus amigos o en algun otro familiar|`|10b7a814126a33fa71942d985bc26274aa	tu mismo has dado con la respuesta correcta a tu problema el psicologo, el te ayudara para q enfrentes la situacion con tu familia, <br>  por q con contarnos a nosotros no crea q nadie tengamos una solucion a tu problema el tiene q ayudarte a sacar lo q sientes para q puedas expresarselo a tus padres, solo es cuestion de q tengas confianza y le cuentes lo q te esta pasando, animo la vida no se termina solo por q tus papas esten distanciados y tu estas jovencito tienes mucho por delante.|`|3edd308c0246dce0d5f6dc43470dcf45aa	hola amigo espero te pueda ayudar decile que se separen .no se que es mejor que no se hablen o que le de golpisa .que se baya de la casa uno de ello.dios te de fortalesa ,un abraso.|`|a705ccdd1dee8558758d1a94d0b5815aaa	Animo chico!!!

Lead him into conversation.|`|9289bf36b0092af9fa7aa94f40349863aa	yea...you should becuase i think he is too shy to take the next step..so you should step up to the plate|`|5paPd4qlaa	talk to him. be very friendly. touch him some so he knows you like him. just his arm or whatever. ask him out if necessary. he sounds shy.|`|AA11858119	Ask urself do u really want him 2 b ur bf...or u prefer 2 b best friends....if u want him back as ur bestfriend lead him into a conversation..tell him dat u do love him n offer him 2 b ur friend again...<br>  <br>  but if u want him 2 b ur bf...tell him u love him n pretend 2 walk away...he'll ask u 2 wait...n there goes a sweet juicy french kisses|`|EtfkFmBTaa	It sounds like he's a lost for words - talk with him and express your feelings as to where the relationship is going, this will probably get him to open-up. So,  this will let you know where you stand.|`|a137f7e7f6c04cb4b35191736137a154aa	my advice is, think twice before taking the 1st step.. think about the friendship that u might lose oneday if things didnt go well.. but you can still talk to him be honest tell him how u feel and that u dont want to ruin ur friendship, take it slowly and if u sensed that things wont work out then take a step back and stay friends|`|FNqJqLTraa	just talk to him like you have before nothing has changed just becuase you guys like each other. Be honest with him and tell him your feelings and let him tell you his. Even though you like each other you have to be freinds first. Dont be scared its not like he is a stranger rent your favorite movie have him offer and pig out on soda and pop corn like you use to.|`|GYifOgLTaa	You have entered a difficult situation especially since you both like each other. It's very hard to be around someone you care for when you first started as friends. Now some things have to change, its ok though, it happens. You start to develop feelings for some one if you hang out with them and are very close. What you have to do is think about your friendship, if something between you both does happen know it changes now everything and are you willing to give that friendship you had before up. Think about the cons more importantly, if you guys do do something and it doesn't end up good, could your friendship continue. I'm in the same boat, I had a friend who I developed feelings for and he did too. But during the whole thing we communicated with each other what we wanted and how we felt. The key here is to talk about it. Since he may not bring up, mention it but don't press the issue. The worst thing you can do is press a guy to do something he doesn't want to do. If you do value his friendship, let him know. Communicate communicate communicate. And if he does like you in that same way, he wil be able to talk to you openly. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|g8VQXEojaa	Yeah, approach him and take the edge off.

AA10554035	Well, previously geographers thought that the better a country's health care system and nutition the longer the life; therefore, a recently developed or currently developing country will see a gradual increase in the lifespan, and will eventually stop feeling the need to have more kids (they previously felt the need to have more kids to account for infant mortality rates, short life spans, etc that could cause an early death in their family and thus set their family back financially, because the don't have enough workers in the family). But if people are living longer, then the threat of not having enough hands on the farm or whatever isn't so big, so families get as small as they can be and still perform the needed functions (in other words, no "spares"), that way the cost of feeding the family decreases as well because there is less members. <br>  ------------------------------<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, more recent studies seem to show that the real determining (or at least a MAJOR one that had been previously overlooked) is the increase in female education in developing or already developed countries. The more developed a country is the more likely the female inhabitants are to receive a quality education that teaches them independence, work skills, and birth control options that women in underdeveloped countries never receive.|`|hy30ogz5aa	increasing -- no birth control available<br>  stable-- w/ birth control by choice<br>  shrinking--too much birth control|`|wovoZ5Z0aa	There are numerous variables, but THE number one reason is the number of children couples have.  2.1 children (average) per couple tends to keep a population stable over time.  (The 0.1 offsets for children who die unexpectedly or for people who die before becoming part of a couple).  <br>  <br>  If couples have more children on average, the population increases.  If couples have less children on average, the population decreases.  <br>  <br>  War and disease can also cause populations to decline, often rapidly and dramatically.

kbbPZ609aa	the question you should be asking is not why guys lie. it should be why PEOPLE lie. <br>  <br>  analyzing your situation, the reason why those guys lie to you is because they want you AND they feel that if they tell you the truth, they might not be able to impress you and you wont want for a second date. so, they do things irregardless of consequences. <br>  <br>  now the thing is separating those who lie to you because they really want you and those who lie because they have an ulterior motive.. and thats the tough part<br>  <br>  the only way you can do this is by giving them time. give them a second chance. tell them that you rather want the truth even though the truth sometimes hurt. <br>  <br>  however, that is not to say that ALL guys lie. sure, they are some guys who rather tell the truth. however, in some cases they still lie because you want to protect your interest. they do not want to see you hurt. they rather be hurt themselves.. AND thats when you found out that you have found the LOVE OF YOUR LIFE|`|EtDHlns8aa	Everybody lies or has lied, guys are just not good at it.  I strongly think women are good at it because of Eve in the beginning.  But there is a negative to this, it has caused men not to listen to women whether they are right, wrong or in between.

dv0zbH7gaa	By law you can. Of course there are legal restraints. I believe you have to have the parent or guardian of the child approve if there 16 or 17... at 18 they have no control. Least that's the law in the UK. But ethically its a bit sketchy. I mean they could really only been with each other for a year or two. Surely they would want to wait.

stMcVPCMaa	I was married for 11 years to an emotionally abusive man.  We got divorced and I've since remarried to the most wonderful man in the world (who I've been with now for 5 years).  My divorce was really painful but I can honestly I am 1000 times happier now than I ever was with my ex.  You don't even realize how horrible your life is with someone who doesn't respect you and blames their problems on you until you're out of the relationship.<br>  <br>  I'd totally get out NOW before he hurts you more.  Pack your bags and walk out the door tonight.  Tell him you'll consider staying if he never drinks again and goes to marriage counseling with you - but only give him one more chance!  If he tries for a while then goes back to drinking, he'll never break his pattern and you need to move on.  It's a shame your mom wants you to stay, but she wouldn't say that if she really cared and/or knew how this is hurting you.|`|B12E4rYiaa	Nobody knows the person they live with like the person who lives with them. They allow them to see them as they really are and put on a front for everyone else. You might be able to save the marriage with counseling, but go ahead and have a trial separation to him know you are serious sometimes you have to make bold statements.|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Alcoholism is a progressive and incurable desease, just like an untreated cancer. l am serious. Unlike cancer however it destroys all those around the affected person. At the moment he's in denial so basically he will get worse, booze will eventually become more important to him than anyone or anything. When you can take no more you will have no choice.|`|pi3UAJgKaa	seriously you should leave him, he might regret it and turn his life around.. there is probably better things out there for you<br>  it may be extremely hard and painful but just do it, as if its a huge bandaid your ripping off, or give him a choice tell him if he doesnt stop drinking or join an alcohal anonomous group you will leave him|`|3aOSvS3Zaa	if you still love him and want to be with him then go to counseling and tell him he needs help, he has a problem. tell him that he scares you and he needs to give up drinking, maybe join AA. if stops drinking he would be a different man, as you know and you might be more attracted to him again. my husband used to have a bad problem with alcohol and i thought about leaving him, but after he went to rehad things couldn't be better. but if he refuses to get help i would leave him because you never know what he could do to you when he gets drunk. stay safe.|`|V9FcPtM1aa	OMG I just got out of the exact situation! Met at karaoke, thought he was a social drinker, small fights escalating, etc.<br>  Please be careful! He has a drinking problem, whether he wants to admit it or not.

If he will not get help, you need to leave before you get hurt|`|Z70uLoeIaa	Oh Girl, i was married for almost 6 years with the same damn problem! i is not fun when they stay out with there friends, (or so they say!! ) We tried marriage counseling..  to me that was the last thing that i could of done to save my marriage! I loved him very much, but just could not do it! You need to think about the future, are you planning on having kids? If you are do you want your kids to see the way he is tward you?  will he go get help!? Ask him! Just tell him it is ME or your DRINKING! see what he chooses!  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!
AA11267011	I have been down this very same road before. But since I have turned myself around. To begin with your new husband did not forget he owed the courts this money he only forgot to tell you.I do not know what state your in but in washington for this type of driving offense which started out as a DWI/DUI then a bunch of driving on suspended I would bet he will have to do all of his time. no good time here so if I were you I would call the jail and ask if they give good time for your husbands type of conviction. You do not even have to mention your husbands name. But I would be asking some pretty hard questions to your hubby about why he was not truthfull with you from the get go ? Now all this effects you his and your familys. Why can't timmy drive and so on. If he continues to drive and gets pulled over again they can keep him up to 5 years in a county jail P.S. is he buying the food paying the rent and so on. He lied to you from jump street about how he forgot about a eleven hundred dollar fine. Stop defending so much and getin his face about his behaviour|`|d6959f140445530c8d381f41dd69fcecaa	Call the prison administration and ask them|`|bO2rzfISaa	Good choice of father. Think he'll "forget" the baby somewhere?<br>  <br>  EDIT: I think you're missing the point people are trying to make. This says everything about his character. It says he doesn't have any, and now you've made that part of your life AND allowed him to impregnate you.|`|OHfZFR31aa	It all depends on the judge, how overcrowded the jails are, and how he behaves in jail. There is no way to know. Some people have to serve their entire sentence, while others might only serve half of it if there is overcrowding in the jail and their offense is not violent|`|XGgPhaDbaa	It's obvious your husband knows how to drive. It's also obvious that he smirks at the law. Stop worrying about when he will get out and start worrying what kind of role model he is going to be for your child.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Call and ask them silly??????????????|`|3wjOk0Saaa	I don't think that is factual|`|e1ydlT49aa	you might want to go down to the police station and ask them...<br>  <br>  and your husband is an idiot... it doesn't take that much to go down to the dmv and take a driving test.... he was charged 5 times? 5? and he still didn't learn? he deserves to be in jail, next time hopefully he'll think twice.|`|h6c0qGwaaa	If I have understood your post correctly his release day after serving out the numbers you used would be around April 14th.<br>  <br>  Sentenced to a year 365 minus credit of 147 leaves 218 days incarceration now minus the 163 days credited as of today leaves 55 days. The date 55 days from today is around April 14th.<br>  <br>  Again I am not sure that I figured this correctly but post the city and state or when was his first incarceration day and maybe someone can figure it out.<br>  You do know it seems even if he was released after sitting 50% of the sentence it does not look like he will make the birth.
AA11646252	Does he like the rest of the house much?  If the rest of the house is more to your liking than his then maybe he just wants something that is decorated for him.  Does he not have a garage that he works on stuff in or some other place for his projects?<br>  <br>  rd|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I wouldn't care about that.  Hell, if my husband wanted to do that, I would probably help him build it so it could get done faster! LOL  I do lots of things that are "just for me", like get my nails done, go shopping, go to the gym, or whatever I want to do, so there's no reason he shouldn't have a place for some "him time" too.|`|BUET39wmaa	because women commandeer the rest of the house and most men don't feel they have any space they can call their own or feel comfortable in.<br>  the bedroom always turns into OUR room. same with the living room.<br>  so just give him his space and let him enjoy it.<br>  is it worth fighting about?|`|442e5f4a3db253f9ae4c7782d74143a1aa	Hey, nothing to worry about. I am planning on a room of my own, basically to put all my books that his very catholic family would not aprove of (and thus are hidden), or my fairy collection that's too girly for my SO's decorating style. I have a bunch of things in boxes and I refuse to get rid of them, and I would like a room where I could display all and maybe read or have a quiet time when I get fed up with things.<br>  <br>  Now, if he sets a bed there and decides to sleep there everynight, then you have a problem. But if he sleeps with you, eats with your family and stuff, you are fine. It's best he gets his room than start hanging out at the bar every day.|`|B12E4rYiaa	Men like to do these kinds of things they need their space. Unless it's to use for porn, gambling or some other offensive behavior. <br>  <br>  They usually like to be in garages and basements fooling around fixing stuff or are computer geeks or maybe just like to study. It depends on what he does in there.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I dont see anything wrong with that maybe he just wants a part of the house that is all his.<br>  <br>  What are you so paranoid about its just part of the basement.<br>  <br>  Chill out and give him a break already.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	All guys need their "space". It's totally normal.|`|lXpGlAm3aa	There is nothing wrong with that.Maybe the rest of your home is decorated in a feminine style.And he just wants his place to store all his stuff.I would not be threatened if I were you.That should be the least of your worries.Ask him if you can be invited into his space sometimes, and hang out with him in his room?LOL then invite him into your space.Like a pretty living room you decorated.<br>  I think that room is a reflection of his personality.I think he may think it would be hot ,if you wanted to make out in his room,too.LOL try and think of it as something good.Besides it might be is time out spot ;when you two have disagreements.=)Don't worry,hun it will be alright.|`|60a21d73367b6bc125257e3aedc3acc9aa	Yes its ok as long as he's not locking the door and doesn't allow you in.<br>  <br>  When we buy a house I know my hubby will want a room of his own. A big TV, and comfortable sofa, a fridge maybe, a bar. And nothing but sports will be on the tv.<br>  <br>  Just make a room in the house yours. Build it around your interests.<br>  <br>  But if he's locking the door, and no one but him has access to the room, then yeah somehing fishy is going in there. Unless he's a huge jerk and controlling. Then leave him and go find someone more interesting.|`|GdBjTovfaa	he sounds like a jerk, I guess i would build the pu$$Y room .. all pink a fu fu with tons of sex toys jells sexy posters of flat belly men and sexy lights and naughty sexy grind music.. dress all naughty and kick back on my pink fuzzy sofa with my fantasy men with feathers doing my toes .. say b!tch how do that feel ..  oh yes get out it's my room|`|XGgPhaDbaa	He probably did it because you took over the entire house with your tastes and wouldn't incorporate his stuff or make one room "cool"|`|1fa8H0m8aa	Everybody needs time alone these days.  I'm sure it'll be ok.  Whatever rocks his boat.  Just be supportive.  He will love you for it.  Good luck!|`|jwftwLBTaa	Everyone needs their own space. Whats not to trust? Is he making it a "loveshack" ?|`|gYWDrHVFaa	What is wrong with that?|`|2KUdefSBaa	Depends whats in his MAN room and what he is doing there.  Is it a play room or a work room? As long as he is not doing something criminal or destructive you have to reciprocate with absolute discretion when he discloses to you. Be patient. Trust is built on such respect.<br>  <br>  Writers often need to be undisrturbed and don't want nosy family reading their work in progress.  Workers working from home don't want disturbances or to get their work space reorganized into confusion by a loving spouse who just wants to be helpful.  If he is working out/exercising  it could be unsafe have someone dropin. <br>  <br>  All recreational computer use should be open to family observation. If he does not want you to see what he's up to on the internet then you may well have cause for concern.   <br>  <br>  Safety and work interruptions aside, a spouse should be able drop in any time.  <br>  <br>  You don't have to be in the room to know whats going on.  If he won't tell you and allow you to confirm then play the game.  Start going out and don't tell him where you are going and with who. NOT DATING, bar hopping, flirting, etc. Just go on innocent verifiable outings like errands, meeting a girlfriend for coffee, etc. See how it goes  Good Luck! <br>  .|`|stMcVPCMaa	I'm pretty sure whether or not he has a man's room is completely unrelated to whether or not he can be trusted.  Lots of guys have man's rooms, including my husband... and he's always trying to see how he can sneak his decorating style into the rest of the house too!  I think he just likes things the way he likes them.  Your husband is probably the same way, and his man's room is just his way to have a space that he feels comfortable in.|`|3aOSvS3Zaa	based on this you should trust him. i think a lot of men do this, why? who knows, men can be mysterious creatures sometimes. i would rather have my husband do this then leave the house all the time!|`|kbUJ0TxJaa	depends on what he has in his mans room. Try telling him your interested in what he has there, and can you have one look.If he refuses the request dont trust him.|`|goaNob34aa	Yes, that's not a bad thing.  If he built a different house or rented an apartment, that would be a bad thing.  He deserves his own space if he wants, as long as he's not rude about it.

That never happens within the family and thus the man is frustrated and this turns to anger so you guys like to push the buttons and watch the show. Do you ever give him some gratitude for helping put a roof on your head by going off to work every day?

And then just ask her.

(He met alot of women online before we met and cheated with some while we were dating)."<br>  <br>  The signs were RIGHT THERE in front of you before you both tied the knot, why in the world would you get involved with a man who cheats or marry him, KNOWING he cheated? you got what you asked for, knowing good and well what he was like. if you can't take it anymore, start over with you life by divorcing him and learn to observe men alot more instead of just ignoring the signs.|`|goaNob34aa	You should end it.  You shouldn't have married him in the first place with your history.  Your life would be better if you didn't have a lying, cheating man in it.  There are a lot of good men out there.  You should cut your losses and start over with a fresh, new life.  Get rid of him and live a happy life or stay with him and have this lying, cheating drama to deal with all your life; the choice is yours.<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry about the loss of your children; that must have been horrible.|`|o5piRiBsaa	Follow your heart and end the marriage.  When you wrote that he threw visiting your children's graves in your face, I was shocked.  Why would you want to be with such a callous, insensitive a-hole?  If he's cheated in the past and you had to bring in a private eye 6 MONTHS into the marriage, it's not worth saving.  Move on and find an honest, trustworthy man who's worthy of you.|`|9oBG7cedaa	to be honest im in your shoes at the mo.... and i dont know wat to do... but in this situation we have to look in our way and our future u lucky no children involve but i do... so now i put my son first rather than him... i do wat i know its best for my son even myself.. cuz i had enough of lies... even so we not marriage yet but i will never married someone you tell lies and cheat... cus you know THE LIAR ALWAYS LIE and  THE CHEATER ALWAY CHEAT so please i just want u to do the best for you , its seem like u do better than him anyway, the more u stay with him the more you give yourself stress, act now before its too late please.....

JtEBaOdjaa	at a wedding or at home?<br>  ah, who am I kidding? Pizza, chicken wings and ice cream on both accounts. lol (no I am not serving pizza and wings at our wedding, but sometimes I wish I could lol)<br>  <br>  AMEN SISTA! lol<br>  I can't go with pizza because the hall we're at doesn't serve it. lol  I definitely wouldn't go with wings though, far too messy.  We are having a buffet of pastas.  Kind of like a pasta bar. Still fairly relaxed.<br>  <br>  However, for the rehearsal dinner, we are going to my parents house, ordering pizza and wings and eating off of paper plates.  Why should I get fancy for that? lol.  We'll actually probably sit around a fire in my parent's yard, having a few drinks, roasting some marshmellows.  Very relaxed and fun.|`|vYSGHKbZaa	My whole wedding is centred around having fun with close family and friends and we have decided to have a gourmet bbq. We will have 4 different food stations set up, one with salads and veges and baked potatoes (and a platter of all the trimmings), another will be a seafood station where we will have fish and prawns... probably set up an oyster stand. then we will have a red meet stand and have a few different spit roasts going and some gourmet sausages, steaks and lamb back strap, and lastly we will have a chicken stand and do chicken sticks, marinated breasts and something else.<br>  <br>  we are also having a dessert stand where we are having a choc fountain with platters of fresh fruit, a big variety of miniature desserts and a candy shop for the guests to fill their favor bags with.<br>  <br>  Our wedding will only have 70 guests and alot of the food is going to be prepared my family and friends before the day. I can't wait...|`|73fuqfSyaa	manacotti and cheesy bread... mmmm|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	I would offer 3 choices. Filet Mignon, Broiled Salmon, and A chicken dish. Having been to numerous weddings, including my own, I would not want to single anyone out who may have food allergies. The 3 choices will give them the opportunity to not only give them a choice, but have it altered to their dietary needs. It is quite easy to get a plain grilled filet mignon, or a plain grilled chicken breast, even if it was made with a mushroom sauce or gravy. I am always greatful to the bride that gives me choices so that I may make ask for a few simple changes to the chef,, due to 30 pages worth of food allergies. I don't want my guests attending my wedding, giving me an envelope, but not being able to eat any food.|`|dpk9n2SSaa	Nikki,<br>  Serving these foods at a wedding is just fine. I have seen it done and at each wedding, everyone had a good time. Some people are just too uppity for good comfort food and want everything expensive and catered. A lot of that catered food is not fit for a pet to eat. I have had some of it and it is just awful. I suggest you cater it yourself with the help of a few family members and friends. It is possible. I have tips for just that on my wedding website and I would be happy for you to check it out. Some of the best weddings I have attended have been those where the bride and her family and friends catered it. The food is great and caterers don't normally provide enough food anyway! Best wishes.|`|lqXmvJdRaa	Chicken. Reason is that you can do a million things with it.|`|lP04jzv6aa	finger foods. I love finger foods like wings, wedges, and what not|`|ECe1rgsdaa	BBQ! I don't care if some people think it is "tacky," it's what we like and that's what we are serving! :)|`|4POGapREaa	Either a blackened halibut or a peppercorn encrusted steak with a mushroom sauce.  Served with garlic pureed potatoes & sauteed spinach with french baguette & butter.  To die for.  Now I'm HUNGRAYYYY!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I just read the comfort food details.  I love pizza just like anyone else but I LOVE cooking & the meal I mentioned would be pretty typical for me to make at home for a few friends.  Although I mostly exist off Hot Pockets so . . . LOL!
K0r2yEQmaa	I wouldn't say you're the one who is insecure. I'd say the people around you are the insecure ones.<br>  <br>  I don't think there's anything wrong with seeking help. Perhaps find a therapist who offers "pro bono" work. If you live near a local university, sometimes they offer free counseling (it gives the psych majors some experience they may be required to have to graduate).<br>  Since you've recognized this "shopping" issue you have, perhaps finding another outlet for your emotional needs. Perhaps jogging, exercising, something that will benefit your physical health and get  your mind of shopping.<br>  <br>  Your emotional shopping is a conditioned and "learned" behavior. The best way to address it is to change it.<br>  Perhaps finding a support group in  your area would also help. Shoppers Anonymous or something of that nature.<br>  <br>  Finding a job in the current economy is a challenge, but just keep looking. Maybe sign up with a temp agency or two.<br>  <br>  As for your disability... I don't want to be nosy or intrusive, but depending on how this came about, can you do any "exercises" to<br>  help improve your memory? Develop a system of mnemonics (methods to help you remember things).<br>  <br>  Escaping a catch-22 situation is frustrating and difficult, just don't give up hope.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Good luck to you.|`|QeJYadsHaa	yeah I agree with her^<br>  this isn't really a question.<br>  <br>  And do I blame you for being insecure? No.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you're too dependant on other people to help you.<br>  You need to straighten yourself up.|`|F57ep5jHaa	if your question is:Do you blame me for being insecure? then no.<br>  <br>  ut otherwise you didn't really have a question.|`|1FKQryQzaa	a car wont make you happy<br>  <br>  you looking down on everything<br>  if you think everything is bad it<br>  will only be bad think of the good<br>  and find a friend that really matters<br>  keep being nice and dont show them<br>  that it gets to you when they harasse u<br>  act 100% ok <br>  if you dont act changed things wont change<br>  make the most of everything<br>  -Q
m3NVpPpiaa	Get your mom on your side and have serious talk with your dad. This is unacceptable behavior from your dad. If you and your mom can't correct him, maybe family counseling may help.|`|cmXf57TQaa	Your dad is being absolutely ridiculous. You and your mom need to stick together and not let him push the two of you around. The three of y'all need to it down and talk and let him know that he isn't going to get respect from the two of y'all if he doesn't learn to respect y'all. A father doesn't do those kind of things to his child. I'm sorry that he is doing that to you :( Since your mom knows everything, you should get her permission to leave the house on the weekends. Stay with some friends or your grandparents and get out of the house away from your father.|`|bPhjNSZKaa	my dad does almost the same thing you need to start telling your mom everything it sounds like shes starting to beleieve you just tell her about what he does then finally record it or something and show her then you can prove to ur mom that he does that!|`|kfWi9ZkEaa	You're a young woman now.   <br>  <br>  You do the shopping, etc - but not for him.  You do it for your mother.  You help out for your mother.<br>  <br>  This creature that sits on the couch: who is he?  He's not anybody you know.  He's just some old loser you've taken in out of pity.<br>  <br>  You're courteous to him, because you are a courteous person.  He's got Tourette's syndrome though: keeps yelling horrid things.  Bit embarrassing, really, but not something you really have to think about or respond to.<br>  <br>  Get the idea?  He is a non-person.  He is an item in the household that you no longer need to pay any attention to other than the forms and public politenesses.  He is a thing.<br>  <br>  Don't have anything more than this to do with him.  Do not try to change him, do not try to save him.  Certainly do not try to raise him or teach him, or improve him.  This is mistake number one.  Don't take him for a jog again, don't do anything with him.  Do not be fooled by your mother, who is hoping you'll get HER out of a jam, by putting your head on the block and trying to save dad.  That's her job. <br>  <br>  If she can't do anything because she works on the weekends then she needs to come home and tell her husband that he either pulls his head out of his <donkey> (sorry, swearword nazis) or she quits her second job, to ensure that her real job, that of mother, is done properly.  This fight is between those two: who wins is between those two.  If she gives him no responsibility he has no occasion to rise to.  She needs to fall on his mercy and see what he does with it. Does he step out from beneath, or does he catch her?  Their marriage needs the answer to this one found out before anyone can go any further but as I say, it's between those two and their weaknesses and fears and cowardices vs strengths and courages and willingnesses.  You can't impact on it: so it's ridiculous for you to even try.  Understand? It's not your problem and you're not intersted in playing third woman in your parents' marriage so they can get their shinola together without you thanks very much.  <br>  <br>  Anything could be going on inside your father:  he may be going through some terrible time but try not to forget he's a big boy, now.   It's not your job to raise him, it's his job, it's his mother's job, it's his wife's job.  But you are allowed your own dignity:  you are allowed to be personally affronted at him and therefore to have nothing further to do with him than society absolutely requires, until he apologises for his snivelling adolescent babyness.<br>  <br>  And feel really, really sorry for your mother, because you get to leave one day, and she doesn't.
zdu3gh8jaa	I have a brother that lives 5mins away (in a car) and a sister that lives 20 mins away( in a car) I see neither and very, very rarely hear from either. If I ring to speak to them more often than not I just get their answer phones and if I leave a message I do not get a return call. It used to hurt but I don't bother now as it has been like this for so long. They manage to stay in close contact with each other though - oh well that's life!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :-)|`|AA11447210	*raises hand*<br>  <br>  My sister and her husband live about 15 minutes from me, and have for almost 7 yrs now.

We see each other once a month on average. But we talk on the phone and email each other a lot. We both work as do our husbands so it's hard to get together. Also as our children got older, we've had to join other families, in-laws, so that cuts down on the times we can get together. My husband has a sibling who only lives 2 blocks from us and we hardly ever see her. Wish I could explain that one, but we haven't been able to figure it out  ourselves. We love her and we're pretty sure she loves us, she just doesn't like to get together with the family.|`|093adb8ec6136150f94ebe4b7a62899eaa	Yes, my brother lives only 25 minutes from me, and I only see him on holidays. He is in town to see my mother often, and he often visits my other brother, but never stops here. I am ok with that. no big deal. <br>  My older brother, I would not see him either, except he works at the same place as I do. He lives 5 minutes from me, and before we started working in the same plant, I never saw him except on holidays.
FCRjn23taa	My husband (active duty) and I have been together for eight years. The first couple of years, whenever he'd deploy, I would be jealous when I'd look at another couple. However, it didn't take long at all for me to  treat each and every phone call, letter, and e-mail as a way of being closer to my husband. For example, 15-20 minutes on the phone with him is, in our hearts and in our own way for the time being, 15-20 minutes of hand holding or holding each other close. I hope that makes sense.|`|LgBwO3eGaa	i dont get jealous, but sometimes i get sad if i stop and think about it.  i miss my husband very much but i know i will see him again soon, and i will be able to touch him and watch him play with our son.  you learn to deal with being apart in your own way, and it makes it super easy if you keep yourself busy.|`|vyNlyfczaa	with the beginning of his deployment I am cool but after like few months I start missing him like crazy... am I jealous I wouldn't named this this way.

012ce5df6ace7ad983efafccbed3b58faa	write the truth..don't be overly nice and compliment too much. just say whatever, because what is written on line isn't as important as what is said in person.|`|HRFgjDZMaa	You should comment back on his pics|`|Nigyj6Sjaa	well if you want to keep talking to him ..<br>  comment his page better
1HTRWrawaa	I think what your husband means when he says you are immature is the fact that you are leaning on him for support and you aren't willing to commit to a full time position and take on the responsibility of that job. <br>  <br>  Your husband wants an equal partner that is working with him to make all your dreams come true. He isn't getting that from you and that's what is making him so angry. We are in a recession and times are hard right now. If you can find a full time permanent teaching job right now, then you better grab it before they are all gone. What if by some chance your husband lost his job? Yes that really could happen!!! Or his employer cuts way back on his hours to save his company from going out of business. <br>  <br>  I repeat....these are hard times. It takes both husband and wife working hard together, to get through this recession without losing everything they have. Listen to your husband. Get a full time job, while there are still some jobs out there.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Yes, of course it can and does. I find it funny, you went to college and graduated, starting working and seem responsible to me. So if your husband thinks your immature, then why did he marry you?<br>  <br>  No, its not your fault honey.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Doing the emergency teaching isn't immature, that's a choice.  Looking for a permanent position isn't a necessity at your age and in your situation.  Your partner is out of bounds - you are not accountable to him this way.|`|76cAAPfBaa	I think better questions for YOU, is if he's already 30 years old, why is he acting kind of immature.<br>  <br>   If he's upset over something as little as this, watch out... now, imagine him after your marriage. <br>  <br>  You might want to make sure you get this straightened out before you take the relationship further.|`|AA10408380	Yes it can. But I agree with the others. Ur not being immature. Only u know u, so if ur not ready for a full time job yet, then don't get one. It's not like ur not gonna, u just wanna get ur feet wet before u jump in for a swim. Being thirty, he should understand that. That's what internships are for, and many do get small jobs in their chosen fields prior to graduation, and even after so they know what they're getting into. Studying and applying theory while u have the cushion of school is one thing, but winging it on ur own is another. So I think what ur doing is awesome. Ur guy needs to cut u some slack, and put himself in ur shoes.<br>  <br>  He bought some land, and will build a house on it. Ok, so he's showing that he'll take care of u. But telling u ur immature isn't exactly taking care of u, is it. U need to b ur best when u work, how're u gonna do that if ur man is questioning ur maturity? He should stop straining u, it's hard enough to start a new career, and now this? I hope he shows some emotional, and mental maturity. But congrats on his fiscal maturity.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Your partner need to relax, and let thing fall into place Bad Idea to do this my x has bought a home with her boyfriend together almost 5 years ago and today  there relationship is on the rocks. He owes her a lot of money. She no longer want anything to do with him but he will not leave and is causing a lot of grief and pain. yelling and being angered all the time big mistake for her. Now she need to find away to get him out before he kills her or my kids. This is no joke very serious. I am going to the RCMP tomorrow for what he said to my daughter on Friday and we hope that this will keep him away from the home for he has become a very dangers man. So think before making big planes like this. If there is no great Love in your relationship think twice before acting, for the price one can pay can be great emotionally.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	That doesn't seem immature to me, and my husband and I have an 8 year age difference.  You aren't out partying, you're not drinking and doing drugs every night.  You're not flirting with guys and cheating on him.  That's what an immature 24 year old does.<br>  <br>  I'd say you're making responsible decisions for your future.  If your husband thinks he's so mature, why is he acting like a pouty baby and belittling you for the choices you think are best for you?  He's supposed to be your guiding light, not your parent.|`|5ajPMlrqaa	It sounds like your partner is concerned about being able to pay for the mortgage and live comfortably, and he wonders if your current employment will be sufficient. Have you thought about this? If you decide that it isn't for you, do you have a backup plan for what you would do work-wise?<br>  <br>  Lots of young people leave university with no clue of what they want to do, so they work for a while to see what they like, and there is nothing wrong with that, but the work they do is not enough to help pay a mortgage and the pile of student loans. They're still carving out a career path for themselves, and trying to find their way, which is appropriate for where they are in life.<br>  <br>  So while you should ask yourself these questions & be honest with the reality of how difficult money is to manage in a relationship, your husband should be understanding of where you are as a graduate. Definitely, definitely, don't marry unless you come to a better place where you can talk about money without fighting. And yes, marriages can break up on account of people not being on the same level with each other in many ways - financially, emotionally, spiritually, etc.<br>  <br>  So talk to him and ask him to listen to your point of view, and do your best to listen to his concerns. Good luck.

hVrfm4eIaa	We went out to a nice dinner and then my husband (then boyfriend) took me to the theater to see my favorite musical.  We were seated in the balcony and I was reading my program  right before the show started, when he tapped my arm.  I looked over to see him down on one knee with an open ring box.  He said, "Honey, I don't want to embarass you but will you marry me?"  I was so happy I kissed him before saying yes.  We were both so excited that we put the ring on the wrong finger!|`|nqINitkmaa	We went to the Marriott at the Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit for a night on the town. We both dressed up and went to eat a beautiful dinner at Seldom Blues. We ate a wonderful seafood dinner on the riverfront, laughing and sharing wine. We went back up to our room which was located on the 57th floor of the hotel. Waiting for us was a bottle of champagne on ice for two. The room was beautiful, the windows stretched floor to ceiling and went the entire length of the room, over looking the Detroit river and the Windsor skyline. While Nick opened the champagne I went for the drapes we had a beautiful view and they were closed. When I opened them written on the window in big letters were the words:<br>  “Kristy will you Marry me?”<br>  Of course I thought that I had ruined his plan or a surprise or something by opening them up so I responded with:<br>  “Oh my god, I’m sorry!”<br>  Nick waiting there on one knee with the ring in his hand laughed and said:<br>  “That wasn’t quite the answer I was hoping for!”|`|dpk9n2SSaa	It was a Saturday and I had to be at work for mandatory overtime at 6am. My boyfriend told me he would take me. I was afraid he would oversleep, but he did not. He came to pick me up at noon and he hand-carried a red rose into the office and gave it to me in front of all of my co-workers. It was so romantic. He said he was taking me out for a steak lunch so I was very excited. It was December in El Paso, Texas and El Paso hardly ever gets snow. We had some the night before and Trans Mountain was dusted with it and it looked beautiful so he said he wanted to go over Trans Mountain which was the long way. He stopped at a lookout point on the mountain highway and we got out to view the rare snow. He then told me to reach into his jacket pocket. I did and I felt a small fuzzy box. I pulled it out, opened it up, and he asked me to marry him! It was a total shock! I said yes, married him four months later, and that was almost 22 years ago and we are still married. Oh, by the way, we did go for the steak dinner right after the proposal and it was the best steak I ever had! Feel free to look at some of my wedding photos at my website, www.create-a-christian-wedding.com.|`|ckJP6TTQaa	My fiance (then-boyfriend) told me a few months into our relationship, "When you're ready you should probably be the one to propose to me, because otherwise I'll probably ask too soon and ruin it."<br>  <br>  So, a few months later, I sent him a bunch of letters that had instructions to meet me at a particular place and time on Feb. 29th. I also gave him an article about how women are "allowed" to propose on Leap Day. Then, when he met me at the pre-determined location, I took him out for dinner and casually asked, "so did you read the article?" He said (squeaked, really) "yes" and I said I just thought it was funny and that what I love about our relationship is that we are egalitarian enough that those kinds of "rules" don't apply -- that I can propose to him whenever I want. <br>  <br>  So then he relaxed and we enjoyed the rest of our evening. <br>  <br>  I took him to a train station that holds special meaning for us because he and I lived in different cities and took the train back and forth to see each other. As I was walking across the main hall, he dipped me back and kissed me. Glancing at the clock to make sure it was time, I proposed to him and gave him a ring which I had hidden in my ponytail all evening. <br>  <br>  He said yes. <br>  <br>  It was midnight -- so I had kept my promise and proposed to him on March 1st rather than Feb 29th.|`|n4d7rqr4aa	My fiance had been joking around for the majority of our relationship, asking me to marry him, only being slightly serious.  And then, one day, he did it again, and I said "Yes," as I always did, and he slid the ring onto my finger.
qPmQvqJXaa	If you haven't heard from him, how can you tell him?  I mean, texting someone isn't a way to grow a relationship.  If he's not around, he doesn't care enough for you.  Take care of yourself.  You need someone that will be there to support and love you.  Loving someone that doesn't give you what you need will only bring you heartbreak.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	The approach is childish. If you haven't heard from your bf for a while give him a call and ask what's up. Don't make assumptions. Maybe he wasn't able to get in touch with you because of a family emergency, him being sick, having a lot going on, etc... Try to find out what's going on first. If he gives you reasons to believe he's no longer interested break the whole thing off and tell him you've met someone else.|`|KZXequigaa	The MORALLY correct thing to do is to get in contact with the bf and tell him what is going on. Tell him you want to date other people and since you haven't heard from him, you at least wanted to let him know on your end you are breaking up with him to do so. Going out behind anyone's back whether you hear from them or not is still cheating.|`|QAEQqgzyaa	Sorry but it sounds like an immature relationship. If that's the best he has to offer I would tell him its over and if you really want to go straight into another relationship that's up to you but you should end it with him before you go to somone else.|`|dEFap0Zaaa	You like playing with fire don't you?

Both me and my boyfriend hate being the center of attention so I don't know how we will do it when we get married. I'm serious about just eloping away from everyone and telling them we're married. I think maybe you should just look at him the whole time, not everyone else there. And don't invite too many people so that will cut down on the number of people watching you. Maybe have a quick little drink before walking down to calm your nerves. Hope you get through the day and best wishes in your new marriage!|`|dpk9n2SSaa	Take a deep breath and focus! This is your day, not your family's day. This day is about you and your husband-to-be. Don't think about anybody else at all and you will be fine. Block it all out and enjoy yourself. Of course, you are a little nervous getting up in front of everyone. I was too, but my biggest fear was that I would trip on my heels because of the long dress and train. I did not trip; I was fine and you will be, too. That was 22 years ago. I have grown up a lot then and am not self-conscious like I was then.

z1O3yQQ0aa	Thats a tuff one, Id call your accountant/ attorney|`|AA11785285	You are married, until the day of your divorce. You may not file as a single individual, just as two people living together may not file jointly, even if they jointly own their house<br>  <br>  He cannot legally file as a single person, if he does not have any divorce papers.<br>  <br>  Your choices are to follow the law....file as a married person, and have your tax guy sort it out for you.<br>  <br>  Your problem is difficult to figure out, hon, since your writing has all sorts of errors in logic.... perhaps because your sentences are unclear.<br>  <br>  Where you live, how you live, what your address(es) is/are is unimportant as far as taxes are.  So, as I stated, legally he cannot file as he did, and therefore he must refile with you as a couple.  How you, your tax guy and the government figure that out, is unclear.  Again, you'll need to seek the advise of your tax man..<br>  <br>  and obtw...."i" in English, does not exist.  There is no such word.
kfWi9ZkEaa	Sorry sweetie, you have to give things another chance.<br>  <br>  "If at first you don't succeed, TRY, TRY AGAIN."  As it were.  If you leave the family history book with a thump and an arm-twist on the final page, you have doomed it to failure.  You have to get back on that horse and ride.<br>  <br>  Talk to the olds (the fogeys, my kids call us)  and say "hey, fogey, I never see it coming.  Can you warn me before you thump me next time so I can choose whether to earn one or not?  I really, really never see it coming...."<br>  <br>  (unless of course you do.  After all, we never admit to what we did/said that caused the thump.  That's irrelevant, lol.)   <br>  <br>  But don't keep them in the dark about what you feel inside, and don't let them do it to you.  These fights are always due to misunderstandings about 'what the other person was thinking' or 'why he/she did it' or 'what they were trying to prove'.  When we know the answer to why, things de-escalate.  <br>  <br>  you also will have to learn how to de-escalate events, watch your tone of voice, make sure when you argue/disagree you are respectful because parents think their kids are being snotty often, when they're absolutely not.  Everyone charges in too fast and reacts to quickly.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps instigate a 'count-to-ten' requirement when in the car?  I don't know - it's likely you've grown out of whatever was setting them off last time.  Find out what it was before you go on the trip.  Talk to them in a non-fighty way.  (I recommend one at a time, when they're together, some parents can wind themselves up in to a self-righteous frenzy and I don't know your parents.)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	So where will you stay while they are vacationing?

Unless it is the other parent of their child and then only involving their child.<br>  <br>  Do you really need to know why?  People need boundaries to live by so they can bring happiness to themselves and others.  Think of your life as a circle and your family as inside that circle.  Who belongs there?|`|zu10q3Qyaa	Why would a married person want to be in contact with an ex lover?  It doesn't make any sense.  The feelings that were there at one time were real and a married person has no right to continue to have contact with that person.  Actually a rule to go by is that "do both people in a marriage feel a mutual friendship with a person?"  If the friend is a friend of both then it's in agreement and ok, or is the ex a threat to the other spouse, real or imagined.  I think the marriage needs to be respected above all other friendships and each person has to be comfortable with the friendship.  My answer:::::if it's both of your friends and there is nothing to hide then the friendship is ok.  If it causes uncomfort or guilt feelings then forget about it.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I have several ex boyfriends as friends.

Talk about your habits and your daily routine  and what you like to do for fun.  Talk about any STDs that either of you might have.  That seems crude, but, eventually you need to know.<br>  <br>  My recommendations for things not to talk about are:  past relationships other than ones that your beau is likely to meet.|`|n8lXItGraa	Who will manage the finances?  A big question that many couples don't discuss before hand.  How much of each spouses paycheck will go into the joint account to pay the bills, and how much if any will be used for fun.  Will each have an allot ed amount of money each week for daily expenses, or will each person retain a certain amount to do whatever they want with.  Try to straighten these issues out before getting married...no one likes surprises.|`|AA10264604	The real answer is EVERYTHING. Or at the very least anything that even potentially could be a deal breaker anywhere down the line, If you look through Answers you'll probably find the most common problems relationships have, and thus should be discussed are things like money, fidelity, kids, how many, and how are you going to raise them, porn, current age, age difference. religion. sexual compatibility, respect for each other, and life changes. Communication is just a given.<br>    I would even add things like pets,how many, and what kind, looks, and what happens when you're not 20 and fabulous anymore, where you live, how you decorate your home. Color schemes,classical, antique, asian, whatever, politics, yes friends and family do enter the equation , drugs and drinking, general health, potential health issues, (susceptibility to various cancers and other conditions) rap sheets, how well do you two handle disagreements and fights. etc.<br>    But you know, even after you've discussed everything ad-nausium, you both still have to ask yourselves some more basic questions like; How deep is your relationship? Both in your view, and how he demonstrates his commitment to you. Do you see yourself together and still in love with this man when you're 80? 90? If there was a way to assure yourselves that you could be together in whatever afterlife there is would you make your commitment forever instead of just till death do you part? Can both of you truly say that you will place your relationship in the forefront of your lives, and make it the bedrock you build the rest of your lives upon 24/7/365 for the rest of your lives? And can you both also affirm to each other that after all the plans you make for your lives together. Kids, homes, jobs,etc.etc.etc. And when life, being what it is, takes those plans and chucks them right out the door and you have to start all over, or make things up as you go along, you can STILL say I love you to each other, and your relationship together WILL NOT SUFFER? <br>  My sentence structure wasn't great on that last one but I hope you get the point.<br>    This is the depth of commitment you both have to have for each other if you really want to have a life together with one another until your last breath escapes your lungs. No time outs, no three ways, no nonsense. This isn't marital hell or the last bastion for loosers. This is love and all the wonderful benefits that come with it. <br>    I really hope the two of you marry and have a wonderful life together. And your marriage is blessed in a million ways.<br>  Good luck to both of you<br>  Peace|`|AA11785285	First, no one can guarantee that any marriage will be wonderously happy forever.... no one.<br>  <br>  But truthfully, I think that marriage is Respect, Admiration, Passion and Trust, a wholelot of lovies and kindnesses toward each other.... and as well, truthfully, I think the  deal busters are abuse, betrayal, and children..... if one reaaaallllly decides they want children and the other decides later that they just reaaaaaaaaalllly don't.  And as well, don't plop any children into your relationship until you know each other well....very well, like 3-5 years.  Be that loving, involved couple before you ask a third to join you.  Children are not bonding, hon, they are divisive.  Be sure your bond is strong.<br>  <br>  It helps that you are of the same religion, of the same politics,race, and in essence that you are facing the same direction, and on the same page.  Marriages that succeed are kind and loving.  And sometimes the best any of us can do is just shut the hell up, and ask for a time out, that "right now, I just don't have language."  Learn the language of solving issues without rage and resentment...Learn to attack the problem, not each other.<br>  <br>  Never be afraid to say, "I'm sorry, and what can I do to fix it."|`|6LKEWFPoaa	I'm not trying to get best answer, but I will say children, money and working. Before we got married we said we would have X amount of children then all of a sudden he changed his mind which I thought was totally unfair since he knew I wanted 2 more. He is a different race so his culture is different. He sends money home to his country when I feel we need it here. I want to (and I'm going to) stay home with my newborn, he wants me to go to work. Just make sure you guys are clear on everything before you tie the knot.|`|AA12264505	all those things you named are very important and need to be discussed beforehand. the only thing i see you missed is spending habits. ask your boyfriend about what he takes as a big big spending. a new BMW or a trip to Mexico?<br>  but remember people often change with time.<br>  if hes not old enough, if hes in a position that there may come changes in his job or income, you'll have to expect some changes to happen.|`|LgBwO3eGaa	most of those things you probably have already talked about ..... have you asked yourself if you could wake up beside this person everyday for the rest of your life .... does he bring out the best in you .... can you imagine a life without this person by your side .... do you argue fairly .... so many people "give up" so easily on their marriage, its something that will have its good and bad times ... are you willing to work thru those bad times and give it everything you've got|`|obXAeNW5aa	I think that all couples that are thinking of marriage should go to marriage counseling it gives you insight on things like Fiances raising children .we all have different idea's on money and raising kids those are two areas that couples really need to talk about what does there credit look like there spending habits|`|9b3xkt36aa	Here's a question.

Sorry it is seems a bit long, but then again, this is the lives of two people.<br>  <br>  Be honest about who and what you want and who and what you are getting.  Make sure you are not telling yourself that you can fix the things about the other that now bug you about them.  Make sure that you actually like and want the person they are, not the person you hope to get them to be.  If that is what you are doing, run now.  For you have no right to change another and it is almost impossible to do so.  Heck, you can barely change yourself, so why could you change another?<br>  <br>  Talk about everything.  Watch other couples and discuss the things you see them do or hear them talk of.  Talk about everything to include how many times a week you would want to have sex.  Talk about what the resolution path is, if you two cannot come to agreement.  Talk about everything you can think of.  Franky, it would be a good idea for you two to sit and just look at yahoo Q and A together.  See if you both have the same answers or ideas to each question.<br>  <br>  I actually would suggest a marriage contract to you both.  It covers all that you wish to put into it and should include a dispute resolution section.<br>  <br>  Also, I do not know if you and he both are religious or not.  But you both should set down and study the Bible.  It will give you the information on how you are to act and why it really is in the best interests of each of you do follow it.<br>  <br>  When discussing things, be totally honest with yourself about yourself and also be completely honest with the other person.  Also realize that how you feel about something today may not be how you will feel in a year.  Well, if you are already married and your mate counts on what you told them, what are they suppose to do since you changed your mind on something?  So better make sure of what you agree to and what you say.  The other person is counting in this.<br>  <br>  Realize right now that no matter what you have, who your are with, etc, there is always someone and something else to want.  The eye is never satisfied.  No matter how good a mate you have, how nice a home, how nice a car, how much you make, there are always more things to want and lust for.  Make sure you keep that in mind and make sure you both can and will keep your vows to one another.   Also, make sure that you always keep in mind that when married, there should be no secrets, nothing off limits or out of bounds for your mate to know or ask or see.  No hiding anything at all.  When married, you and the mate are legally responsible for one another as well to a point, so secrets are not the way to go.  You have to think of the mate in all you do, for what you do and fail to do has an impact upon them.<br>  <br>  Once married, you are married.  I despise people who marry and then try to still act and live as if they are single or dating.  If you want to be married, then be ready to live it.  Single is fine if you are.  But married and acting as if you still only have to consider yourself is silly and unfair to your mate.  Also, do not put yourself in spots which makes your mate have good reason to question you or wonder about you.  This is also unfair to you and them.<br>  <br>  I also offer these to you:<br>  <br>  1. Do not ask or expect anything that you are not willing to do yourself or do for your spouse. <br>  2. Whenever the other person makes you angry, try to think of something very similar which you have done either to them or another. This will help you not only do better in the future.  It will also help you see that you are just as human and as rude as your mate is many times.  It will also help you see that your mate is simply human and makes mistakes too.  It is hard to remain upset with someone who has done little more then you have done yourself, in regards to being rude, thoughtless, selfish or so forth. <br>  3. Realize that many times, you are arguing emotion as much as fact. Just because you think or feel something doe's not make it right or correct.<br>  4. Be reasonable. Many times, people are upset because things are not as they assumed or thought they should be. Yet these people never realize that much or what they think or want is as much fantasy as it is realistic. <br>  5. Remember that while your mate may not be Prince Charming or Cinderella, you really are not Prince Charming or Cinderella either.  You are no more special then anyone else is, nor are you more deserving of things then they are.  If we usually got what we deserved, we would be far worse off.<br>  6. Occasionally, you should ask yourself just what benefit your mate gets by being with you. Yes, you can ask the same of being with them, yet a person should ask what it is they deliver or give or provide that makes them so special or worthwhile to another. If more people would ask that of themselves, they may find that they are not all they wish to envision themselves to be and they would not be so demanding or nasty with others.<br>  7. Try to think of thin|`|yQfaj7c2aa	There are so many! First, the romance is great and very special -try to hang on to this, but make sure that once this fizzles some -that you are able to truly communicate and that you are good FRIENDS! This is so huge -probably one of the most important things! Also, make sure that you clarify your expectations of marriage and for each other. What do you picture marriage as and what does he picture marriage as, are important things to ask each other. Do you want kids, if so -how many? How do you want to take care of them (stay at home mom/dad, daycare?). Money is also a large issue... one of the biggest things married couples seem to fight about, so make sure that you have similar priorities or outlooks in this area. If he's a spender and you are a saver, this could spell trouble. I think it is also important to ensure that you have some things in common. By this I mean leisure activities, such as you both like to go biking and to play team volleyball. At the same time though, allowing each other their own space and fun is important. If I were to get married to my husband again, I would have pursued premarital counseling. This is so important because some of the small things that you may not see as critical can become very critical. The biggest things my husband and I argue about are money, the kids (most particularly discipline of them), and communication. I'm big on communication and want to discuss most everything, he doesn't or just isn't into talking much. I always tell him he's not a man of many words, so make certain that you guys can find a way to always reconnect (marriage can get so busy and crazy with work and with kids, that it is important to be able to lean on each other and to connect in an emotionally intimate way). It's important to take into consideration little things like does he like to cook, or will that always be your responsibiltiy, Does he clean up after himself or feel he should take responsibility for some of the household chores, etc. These become important issues later. In-laws can be tricky, you may not always get alongwith them, but you need to be sure that you two can get past this. Once you're married he will need to understand that you are now his immediate family and vice-versa. This will clarify how large of a role or how much interference others will play in your marriage. My husband and I are two different religions, so you will need to clarify your expectations in this area and how large a role the church will play in your lives, particularly once kids come. <br>  <br>  I'm not trying to scare you, only to prepare you! Marriage can be a great thing and having 'a soft place to fall' is the best part of marriage, by far. This is just advice meant to give you guys the best advantages possible. The more you can communicate about these things before hand the better prepared you will be! I'm in school at the moment getting my master's in Marriage and family therapy, so some of this I know in theory and some I know from experience! If there is one thing I can't stress enough it's COMMUNICATION! If you guys can communicate well you can get through just about anything! I wish you both the best! You're on one of the most wonderful journeys life has to offer!<br>  Take care-<br>  <br>  Belle|`|IAsOppxgaa	I have been married 7 years and with him 10 I was so in love with him when we were dating but never asked him what he really wanted out of life, now we have two young children and I feel we are to diffrent people that want diffrent things out of life.

Nowadays, when people stop loving each other they realize there could be someone out there much better for them, and they are willing to find them.  And now, divorce is not so much taboo anymore and people are subconsciously a little less cautious when considering marriage.  I think a lot of people in the back of their mind say "Well, if it doesn't work out, we can get divorced."  A lot of people don't even realize right away just how little thought they put into it.  And I think today a lot of the problems are not so much disagreements as much as just not really being into each other.  People change when they get older, and sometimes people just grow apart.  It's sad and I don't think divorce should be taken lightly, but I don't think anyone should just settle for someone just because they made a wrong decision.  I think things that really ruin a marriage are abuse (whether physical or emotional) and infidelity.  Basically anything that jepordizes trust is something you will always remember and makes it hard to live with someone.  Hope I answered your question!|`|sD77eXUuaa	the divorce rate is so high right now because people are in a rush to grow so fast.<br>  the rate is high because most people marry for the wrong reasons<br>  and are not honest about themselves or to the person that they say they will love for ever.<br>  the rate is so high because there is no communication with spouses<br>  now a days.<br>  people no a days have no faith or back bone to stick things out and its sad<br>  every relationship has its problems and should be worked out you should never just think every things ok because you cant read minds<br>  so you don't know what your spouse is thinking.<br>  i you want a health marriage then you have to <br>  talk <br>  listen to each other<br>  compromise<br>  ask questions if you are unsure of thinks<br>  learn to forgive<br>  don't hold so much anger towards each other <br>  never go to bed mad<br>  ever if you didn't do any thing wrong just say your sorry and move on<br>  go out date (WITH EACH OTHER)no one else<br>  tell each other good things that you like about each other<br>  try new things<br>  never fight below the belt<br>  don't bring kids and other people into your problems ever<br>  and get professional help when you cant do any more.|`|oGo4ftFMaa	To me it seems like someone is always trying to find the next best thing. And don't take their vows serious, and understand the meaning of them. And no one seems to be fully loyal, and they seem to not think they are ONE when they are married.|`|NSKLYneEaa	these days marriage is like " i wanna spend the rest of my life with you" but eventually couples break up cause they don't try to stay together or work it out. People think now that after a couple of arguments they have to break it. Also getting a divorce these days is just by signing a letter and that's it, how easy was that!  True couples would be the one's you see who are older and still love each otehr cause even through all the arguments and fights, it's still caled love to them.|`|D3ep2x7caa	As humans we tend to be self centered and caught up with too many different things in life. The more freedom we have with things, like deciding to remarry, has caused people to think it is okay to make mistakes and start over as many times as they please. Of course, in reality, it definitely IS okay to make mistakes--its how we learn. But its also how we FIX our mistakes. people don't take the time to try and work things out, or try and see what caused them to change. sometimes, it is because of our own selfishness and free will that we act upon things too quickly. That's not the case for everyone, but it seems it is for most.|`|vR7Bew2Xaa	I think because people think getting married is a great thing, but really its not.<br>  and there's a lot of people, that after they get married they start acting like jerks, and you get to finally see the REAL person.<br>  That's why i think i wouldn't even get married, i don't think i ever will unless i've been with that person for like 8 years.<br>  I mean, its a piece of paper and a ring, plus the person you marry.. haha.
pg0q9eoUaa	Embarrassment of having a broken relationship in front of peers and family;verbal abuse; low self esteem;fear of not being able to provide what is best for the children;worry for the future. <br>  It takes years to finally figure out that no matter how bad the future could be outside of that net of relative security;and if you never have more than what you left with; you would still be blessed with happiness of freedom because you would be taking back your life and taking control. I think we stay until we have nothing left to give.|`|sCCjAKllaa	Because that's their preference. I don't understand it, either. They feel as though they'll be able to change everything when they can't, and basically just waste their time for no apparent reason.<br>  <br>  I've learned to accept that women like that have no direction in life, and if they prefer that kind of treatment, then you let them stick with their devices. Being a nice guy doesn't make any difference anymore.|`|ubbKS6BBaa	Because they're used to it. Eventually they'll get sick of it but it'll be on their time.|`|th7C1aoaaa	Fear. Low self esteem.|`|kY4jaKJzaa	because all the bad women have the good men.|`|ec48c16dc112b295020793ee70d144e3aa	Why do good men put up with bad women?|`|uuMCGT9taa	we dont learn til later|`|E25Q16N7aa	This is a very good question.  Imo, we learn about relationships what we see in our families growing up.  It's not that women want to be mistreated, but if they grow up in a family (ie.their parents) where the woman is treated badly or the husband is lazy this is what they feel comfortable with.  So, to be treated well feels peculiar (it's all new and strange and peculiar in their experience), but to be treated poorly is whats known and although it is not liked, it feels comfortable.  Growing up in this type of dysfunction is what they have learned to be functional (it's what they have seen as how a couple operates and how their family dynamic worked growing up).  <br>  <br>  I used to wonder why nice girls date jerks and stay with them (and vice versa) and this is what I have discovered to be the reason.  Unless someone is conscious of this and makes an effort to discontinue this form of relationship the pattern will continue into the next generation ( and on and on...).  History does not repeat itself, people do.  It sucks because the person is unhappy and often (not always) they enter another bad relationship.<br>  <br>  Congratulations, for getting out of a bad relationship.  Please hang in there.  The best is yet to come : )|`|1Qha5gwVaa	Maybe because they seem hard to get and represent a continuous challenge for many women out there. You constantly have the feeling that you can change them and don't want to give up as long as you believe that some love or passion or what it is, is there. Good women want to be accepted and accept others as they are(which is not a virtue in this case)|`|Bq51x58jaa	u say u have alot of self esteem. maybe now u do but u couldnt have when u were with him or there would be no way u would of let him treat u like that. well done for getting rid. wish i could do the same.|`|9oBG7cedaa	not all the men... but some i agree with... but to be honest that woman its become a loser herself to tie down with him, but the end of the day... probably she put her children first rather than herself like you are.... but if i speak about you... you should defenitly move out ages ago, no point hanging there, u already admit u do better than himself but dont you think ur children deserve better than abusive!!! im happy for you u defenitly do the right thing of divorcing him.... well done!!!|`|BUET39wmaa	think women live in a dream world where they think their behaviour and treatment of others can actually CHANGE PEOPLE.<br>  <br>  you can never change someone.<br>  <br>  EVER|`|bO2rzfISaa	I'm beginning to believe it's because the world is full of bad men. Sad.|`|n8lXItGraa	Because women are nurturers by nature.  They don't give up easily, and they don't want to hurt anyone.  Women always seem to think that things will get better and someday he will see the light.  They will almost always try to keep the family intact.  Pretty much what you've said above.  Unfortunately most women aren't as lucky as yourself to be financially independent, yet another reason why they stay.   Hope this helps..|`|YzObEmUqaa	Hope<br>  No self esteem<br>  He does her good in bed<br>  with his bump & grind.....<br>  <br>  Long list dear.|`|QP8LdPLeaa	this is ONE thing that i can't and absolutely can't stand about women, is how WEAK they are and don't know how the read the obvious signs to leave until its too late or too far into the marriage to where they wasted so many years of their life with some stupid jerk. i have come across many questions from scared wives who don't know what to do when they say things like "i have no job, my family is not around" to me those are just excuses, there is ALWAYS a way of getting out, they are just scared to take that first step. <br>  <br>  this situation is one of the reasons why women need to learn to be independent just incase something like this happens, i never agree with women being housewives because they depend on someone else to take care of them when their old enough to take care of themselves.<br>  <br>  women are just scared, they feel like there is no way out, they feel comfortable with where they are and dont feel like adapting to a knew environment even though their marriage is miserable, and the biggest reason is that women think they can change men. i have noticed this for quite some time now. if for 7 years your husband has been abusive, what makes you think he'll suddenly change? so i think women just hang on to those false hope that men will change.|`|nRFZwdN4aa	Because being alone is a scary, scary situation. You have to imagine being completely alone and trying to carve a life for yourself, alone. You are in a strange city. People don't have time for you. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you think you are deeply flawed in some way and don't think you will ever find another man. Even for someone who has few personality flaws, it is hard to know who to trust, whether someone is a player or a thief. If you are alone, you have to navigate all of the practical irritations and frustrations of life, alone. If you can't find a job, you're S.O.L. if you are alone, unless you are unusually emotionally resilient. <br>  <br>  If you are middle-aged, this world is a cold, indifferent place unless you have your own connections. Trying to make those connections is an overwhelming task if you are insecure and don't trust that people will accept you as you are. <br>  <br>  Staying with a 'bad man' is sometimes the path of least resistance. It is a known variable, even though it is extremely unhealthy and unpleasant. Sometimes people in abusive relationships imagine the alternative, and that is being completely alone in the world. You are staring at four walls and realize that not a single human cares whether you live or die. (Or maybe people care and you don't know it) Either way, that's why some people stay, even though it is extremely detrimental over the long run.

The only thing I would have changed would be to have had a live band for the reception, instead of just a dj. <br>  I would hope I could donate point/money to others, though!!!|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Ha!

OHfZFR31aa	it's good that you were smart enough this time to get out when you could. Unfortunately bad guys don't usually show their bad side up front.

Keep strong and keep looking|`|IE1LvgD9aa	Sounds like an alcoholic. Don't look back!

62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	sex is what you get from companionship ...is it not. the fact that sex can be bought and paid for makes it all the less important in a marriage,don't get the wrong idea, rock your  W/H world in bed....<br>  however, the fact you understand your man needs to wind down and find some quiet time , blows me away. most women i have been with are only thinking of themselves and seem to always want to be right.<br>  90%-10% is my answer. <br>  <br>  you rock|`|xUCXXb73aa	100|`|y9CgveCGaa	I love sex, but, companionship is way more important.  I'll give it 90% to 10% in favor of companionship.|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	For me it is 70% sex vs 30% companionship. I have a strong drive for sex and while my wife enjoys it, sex is not the first thing she wants to do if she finds some free time. The longer I go without sex the more cranky, detached, and uninterested in other aspects of our life I get.<br>  <br>  When my wife turns down sex too often then I stop asking... and she almost never initiates. Eventually it will occur to my wife that she needs to give me some attention... and when she does our relationship usually rights itself.<br>  <br>  It may sound sad, but if she wants to keep me motivated to work hard, keep the yard and the house looking nice, to be pleasant to my in-laws, to accompany her on errands, luncheons, and endless commitments that I could care less about.... If she wants that then she knows that she needs to wear me out once in while.<br>  <br>  I suspect that once we get older the percentages may flip flop a bit.<br>  When I am getting what I need I am pretty sure that I am a good husband, friend, and provider... I enjoy just spending time with my wife, but really, if it were up to me we would be having lots of sex... less volunteering at church, less watching the same reruns when we get home from work...
51acbe8d76e943be6450d2e1ba80f1cfaa	Just because you resemble your father doesn't mean your ugly. I was always told I look like my father too. It didn't bother me. I knew I had his eyes and the same shaped face, but I still looked like a girl. My granddaughter looks like her father, but she's a very pretty little girl. Whether you get along with your father or not, your part of him. There's no way to get around that.|`|AjBpAPpdaa	Aww...they don't mean it, obviously you don't look exactly like a grown man who's fathered kids, people just say that ya know|`|ROxDjgIVaa	xD people say i look like my dad too! BUT people are ALWAYS saying I'm a very beautiful girl.  When my family first saw him for the first time 2 months ago they where like "If You where a boy, you would be a very handsome boy."<br>  <br>  Just correct them if they say that again. Say something like "Thanks. But i don't like being said that i look like my dad, since he is man. But Thank You really. I have his eyes" or something like that.<br>  <br>  you may be actually very beautiful. You could have your dad's eyes and noes then you have your mothers skin tone and mouth. I dunno. i can't really say since i have never seen you.|`|cd87c1cf515692ef0adc60a28df772b0aa	I can understand why it bothers you to be compared to a man whom you don't get along with, but trust me when I say, just because you "favor" your dad doesn't mean you look like a man. Not all features are inherently masculine or feminine. Many features are common on men and women and don't make you look like a boy or a girl. For example, let's say your dad has rounded eyes and your mom has almond shaped eyes. Let's say your dad also has brown eyes and your mom has blue eyes. Let's say your dad has wavy black hair and your mom has straight blonde hair. If you end up having rounded eyes that are brown in color, and wavy black hair, it doesn't mean you look like a man. You could also reverse these features and give you and your dad almond shaped blue eyes, striaght blonde hair (because the one with black hair might have a recessive blonde gene and the brown eyed one may have a recessive blue eyed gene). These features aren't masculine or feminine.<br>  <br>  My cousin looks really feminine, but she favors both parents. She has some of her mom's facial features, her body shape, and her hair texture, but she has her dad's height, and his hair and eye color, and his skin tone. And actually, she prob. has his nose, so I guess she has both parents facial features. I think I have both parent's facial features (including face and ears). And as for colors (skin, hair, and eyes), my eye color is closer to my dad's, and my hair is lighter than either of theirs. I have dad's skin tone. And as for hair texture, I have mom's hair texture. I get told I look like both of them. I have both their dna, so I am not surprised to get some of dad's characteristics, even though I am a woman. I have seen really feminine women look a lot like their dads and handsome guys look a lot like their moms.<br>  <br>  If it really bothers you, IF people know you and your dad don't get along, I'd say, "Really? I hate to hear that because dad and I don't get along so well." If however, your dad isn't really mean to you, and it's just normal disagreements that happen in families, I'd try to bite my tongue and let it slide. Just don't act exactly happy about it. Maybe they will get the clue and stop saying it so much.|`|RRnK3BuYaa	usually when people compare me to my father  they tell me i have his eyes or certain features.<br>  honey i promise you that they dont think your ugly. Next time someone tells you that you look like your father... you should correct them.

And she is very Feminine and beautiful. So it night be a compliment.
7foornMVaa	Well, I would wonder what was said and what happened and then when I find out, I would take it from there.  If you don't add details to your question, you are gonna get uninformative answers.|`|lXpGlAm3aa	I'd want to know what WTF!!!! Who is this female calling saying stuff.You need to talk to your husband,and get the truth out.|`|DNwHGeEtaa	It depends on "what was said and what happened." It could be the case that what was said and what happened was just something innocent. For example, she might have said something mean to your husband (ex: "your tie looks ugly"). Then there's nothing to worry about. But if she said she loved him and kissed him, then you better tell your husband to stop talking to this woman and never answer her call again. But you have to find out what she meant by what was said and what happened. I guess you can ask your husband. If you trust him, then there's nothing to worry about. But if you don't trust him, you know there's a reason why you don't trust him.|`|Yx5GlOJDaa	I would talk to my husband and find out what happened and what was said. If you don't believe him do what I did to my ex-boyfriend.... I called the girl myself and found out the truth cause he wouldn't talk to me. It might not be something you really wanna hear but considering your his wife you have the right to know what's going on with your husband!!!!
qPmQvqJXaa	There is really nothing you can do except be supportive and understanding.  You brother needs to be in counseling when he feels like he is ready.  Until then, you just need to be there for him to share his feelings.

However, we are each others best friend.<br>  <br>  All the great marriages I know are the same. The two are each others best friend.

Just remember this:  "Birds do it, bees do it, even uneducated fleas do it...."
vMKfa53saa	you should get emancipated moms like this are uneducated, stubborn, close minded, and will end up miserable in life. don't fall into that circle. if i were your mom and that other mom i would just take away the matches. i mean it's not like you guy are five or something. your mom is stupid so is that other lady.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	Buck up, take the punishment and learn for the next time.  You knew it was wrong.  And that is the whole point of a spanking, if it was "fun" it wouldn't be a punishment.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	I would have whooped your butt too! I've been in the children's ward of a burn center. It's not some place I would EVER want my child to have to be in.

You may not want to be a tattle tale, but if you don't learn to speak up to stop something dangerous or harmful you can get into just as much trouble as the person doing it.|`|CPkW0F4Taa	well being spanked is better then being burnt and dying!<br>  your just as guilty because you told them to open the window so your moms wouldn't smell the matches.|`|nsVbWXKraa	UR MOTHER DID THE RIGHT THING!!!!|`|Eug52iQDaa	Aahhh the truth does come out.  Read what you wrote to us, sweetie.  Then go to your mom and apologize and mean it.  <br>  <br>  I saved spankings for life-threatening punishment.  I'm betting your mom does too.<br>  <br>  Think about what could have happened in that garage, ok?  Fire gets out of hand VERY quickly.  Have you ever burned yourself on the stove, hot pan, or bbq?  Imagine that feeling all over your body, and it won't stop.  I don't mean to scare you, but burns are some of the most painful injuries to try to recover from.  Many people don't.  You need to know that you girls scared the ever-loving life out of both mothers.  Both moms wanted to make sure that you girls remembered that playing with matches is dangerous and forbidden.  They're right.  <br>  <br>  You know what helped in my house?  The girls would come to me when they were curious about things and we would do them together.  Ask your mom if you could do that with her.  Light a candle with her, and promise ONLY to ever use matches or lighters when you ask her and when she's there.  Then you better keep that promise!|`|UWx1beYtaa	Once she has calmed down you need to tell her you were about to tell them to stop when she walked in. I have found it is never good to try and talk to someone when they are in a bad mood, it can sometimes make them worse.|`|e1oky4jSaa	I don't agree with spanking at all. I don't think that solves the problem. And I think it was definitely wrong for your mom to spank you TWICE, again when you got home.|`|fHwGbsRMaa	If u live in the Uk that is illegal.|`|91cf384812c70e7be98127cfb613c955aa	I don't think the answer was to spank you, especially considering your age.  However, you most certainly deserve some kind of consequence.  You were there long enough to see what was going on and tell someone, but you didn't.  That's just as bad as lighting the matches yourself, which is why your mom punished you too.  Take some responsibility hon.  Being labeled a "tattle tale" is alot better than being in the hospital covered in burns.  Fire can get away from you in seconds (I know from experience) and you all could have been hurt seriously.  If you're curious about something, ask an adult to help you learn about it.  <br>  <br>  Your mom did what she did because you scared the life out of her and she is well aware of what could have happened if they hadn't come in when they did.  It may not have been the most appropriate punishment, but hopefully it got the point across.  Wise up!|`|QilfSBfsaa	You mom just worry about you, she wants you to remember that you should not play matches, also she wants you to remember that you must stop other kids playing matches, if you cannot stop them you have to let the adults know at once.  I am sure you will remember this as you are a good kid.|`|pPKhVRXJaa	for us moms this is obvious. you didn't tell them to stop and you tried to help them hide it. you don't even seem to think it is a big deal. your mom was using a spanking to make sure you never ever do that again.<br>  <br>  based on what you wrote i'm not sure she spanked you hard enough. perhaps she should have pulled your pants down too like the other girls. you are certainly just as guilty.<br>  <br>  next time, go tell a grown-up immediately. if you stand there and watch you should get spanked.
O7u9xFwHaa	you think thats not fair, listen to this...my bro stays out until 7 am doing whatever he pleases and i cant even stay out until past 8 pm!! its such a stupud double standard because all parents with daughters are convinced that we are going to end up pregnant and alone...the only solution (that i have found) is that i need to finish college, get a job, get married and have my own life...otherwise your family never will leave you alone...|`|OiNeG7wiaa	well even tho you are 21 you still live at home...so you have to respect what your mom wants.<br>  <br>  if you don't like it...than you will just have to find a way to move out...but until you do...you just need to deal with it!<br>  <br>  there's nothing you can do about it...it is not your house...<br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  peace.|`|QilfSBfsaa	I totally agree with you, it is not fair.<br>  But if your mom's son's girlfriend get pregnant, it is only her son has to pay child support; but if your mom's daughter gets pregnant then your mom will have big headache to take care of her.|`|2SliUBwIaa	No tell them they are unfair, and slam the door in their face the next time they try to say something.|`|DSTQ8JQAaa	It is NOT fair!!|`|y6H6TNkhaa	this is so not fair. you should be trusted i mean u can drive you've gratuated high school and your past drinking age. your a grown women tell your parents its time u make ur own decisions|`|Eug52iQDaa	It's not fair, but you DO live under their roof.  Fair  - well, you may not get those concessions.  You do need to respect their sensibilities.  Leave the door cracked open.  If you want to do something they can't see, go to his place.|`|8ilHQMq5aa	its not fair but you arent going to change thier mind|`|I8nIewQHaa	Yes it's because your a girl. Your mom looks at it like as long as your still under her roof she can make rules and you have to follow them. Sorry to say as long as your living there it's something your going to have to deal with. It's not fair but just say ok mom. Your mom is worried about you doing things like... (sex) shhhhh. Try not to worry about it she just being your mom and trying to protect you.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	NO! It's not fair! Just because your brother is a boy means diddle squat! He should be treated the same way and your mom and grandmother should have the same respect for those girls as they do for you! Shame on them!  Remind them you could be at his house with the door closed because at his house he's a boy just like your brother!|`|m3NVpPpiaa	No it's not fair at all. Your not a little girl anymore. Explain that to your mother and grandma. Can't you sleep at your boyfriends place?|`|c8m3rOS1aa	no this isn't fair at all<br>  <br>  try sitting down with your family and telling them <br>  your point of view.
jJ152e8Iaa	I say you do talk to him, tell him, "i came home and i walked by my room and saw u in my cloths... is there something you want to talk about? im here for you, i love you, you are my brother, i will try my best to help you out in anything." Make sure it really does stay between you and him or else he will never trust you again. But then again.....<br>  <br>  My boyfriend says, Get one of your female friends, to try to seduce him, to see if he does, if he doesnt, he is gay, then you talk to him about it. Stuff like, "Listen, i am your sister, i wont tell anyone, this is between you and me, are you really gay or not?"<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope i helped, if so, please vote for my answer to be "best answer" thank you!!!|`|0YDtjp3Baa	thats kinda weird lol. maybe he wants to feel like what its like to be you. he must look up to you.<br>  <br>  please answer mine:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ajmi3HX1xu6SMtKTEb10rBW_7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222135945AALaGS8">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|jZguzD2Raa	Um, I would tell him that he has his own clothes and to stay out of yours.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	Tell him you love him!

Ask him if he wouldn't mind NOT wearing your clothes, you are perfectly happy to help him get his own girl's clothes, but you'd rather he didn't wear yours.<br>  <br>  And for the record, if a guy likes wearing women's clothes, it doesn't mean he's gay. It means he likes wearing women's clothes.
A59a5bJcaa	First tell them WHY & HOW MUCH it means to you, next show them it means enough that you even posted this question, then keep telling them you need to do this and why, even if they say no a million times keep telling them once a week or so and wear them down ! good luck kiddo I lost my brother 29 yrs ago and kinda know what you mean about keeping a part w/you always|`|HTGDHSnvaa	i have the same problem.<br>  im 14 and will be 15 in november.<br>  i want my belly button pierced.<br>  i just keep talking to my grandma (who is my guardian) about it. and tell her all the positives about it.:) i tell her it wont be that noticeable and that if there are times she don't want me to wear it i will just hide it or take it out.<br>  i hope you have better luck than i did and that this can help! your not the only young teenager who wants something pierced! :)|`|Eug52iQDaa	Sorry, honey, no support here either.  Piercing (not pricing) is something that you get done as an adult.  If the jewelry is something that was worn by your sister, there are other ways you can always have it with you.  Use your imagination!  You can weave it into a piece of leather and wear it around your neck as a necklace.  There are dozens of ways you can keep a momento with you.  Most of all, respect what your guardians ask.  I don't think they're being mean, just concerned for you.|`|ON84EQaBaa	I agree with your guardians at 13 you really don't have a clue about what you want, if you did a tongue pricing wouldn't be one of them, give it until you're at the age where you can do what you want to do, and I bet then you will be glad you didn't get the pricing!|`|hm4oU8bDaa	I would do the same thing.<br>  Why won't you just get a dog tag necklace with a picture of your sister on it and wear it around your neck?<br>  <br>  If you get a tongue ring, it can mess you up.<br>  This is the bad things about tongue rings:<br>  Your tongue is used for eating, talking, chewing, and swallowing. Once you perform these activities with jewelry on your tongue, you're likely to fracture or chip the enamel on your teeth. This kind of damage can eventually send you to the dentist for fillings, crowns, root canals, or teeth extraction. If you don't damage your teeth, you may cut or puncture the interior of your mouth. Since your tongue may repeatedly rub against the same area, you may even develop ulcers in your mouth, which when left untreated, can turn into pre-cancerous lesions. Often, these are only caught during an oral cancer screening when you visit your dentist for a check-up. <br>  <br>  Of all the problems associated with piercing, however, infection is the most troublesome for people. The tongue is covered with bacteria, and when you pierce, that bacteria can get in the tissue in your tongue and your blood. Both of these can cause serious infections. Unfortunately, you may not be aware of any problem since the symptoms of infection, such as swelling, are similar to the aftereffects of piercing. <br>  <br>  Even if you don't catch an infection immediately after the piercing, you may have exposed yourself to other illnesses. Dentists are reporting a rise in cases of Ludwig's angina, a severe infection of the floor of the mouth and jaws, in patients who underwent tongue piercing. When Ludwig's angina occurs, your tongue may swell so much that it inhibits your ability to breathe. Another condition afflicting patients with pierced tongues is endocarditis, a disease caused when bacteria enters the bloodstream and infects and weakens the heart valves. <br>  <br>  Another problem that concerns the AGD is that most body piercers are unlicensed and are not members of the medical profession. Because of this, there are few standards for them to follow. They may not sterilize their equipment and may even reuse needles to minimize their cost. Without sterilized equipment, piercing may put you at risk for serious infections, like Hepatitis and HIV.|`|UWx1beYtaa	I understand why they won't let you have it done. I'm 22 and have my tongue pierced but I did it when I was 18 and legal. My parents would never had let me do it if I wasn't 18 and I would never let my children do it until their 18.<br>  <br>  You need to see their (your parents) side of this and not just yours.|`|FzyxiS4waa	maybe that's the reason why they won't let you because its going to remind them of your sister and if you really do want it you should really wait|`|XGgPhaDbaa	No you are too young and everyone knows that a tongue piercing means you give oral sex. Learn to spell.

KOXcw4klaa	the problem with your hubby is partly due to his job.that type of work seems to give people the notion they are always right/perfect and everyone else is wrong.trust me my brother in law was a guard now a state cop.but i think your hubby should remove all dangerous things like his pepper spray and leave it in the trunk of his car or glove compartment of his truck locked up where your kid cannot reach or get to it.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	children make mistakes all the time..if they are young..they are curious to know what it was..don't make this bigger than it is..you cannot watch your child every minute of every day..things happen|`|4dXcZhuTaa	well he should feel stupid because it is his fault completely that she ot into it.|`|I814g6ZBaa	You have three issues here...<br>  3. Your messy husband leaves his stuff around and its driving you crazy. Strike some kind of compromise about that.  He was probably just like that when you got with him.<br>  2. You feel torn about picking your child over your spouse, and as you didn't make this child with this spouse... CHILD always wins, period.<br>  1. Your 9 year old child SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN TO PUT HER HANDS WHERE THEY DON'T BELONG!!!   A *curious* 2 y-o might get a face-full of pepper spray and 100% not deserve it, but Mom, your kid ought to know damn well that that THINGS THAT ARE NOT HERS ARE NOT TO BE MESSED WITH.<br>  She got her punishment, though.

hYRP0x2Eaa	Yeah I completely understand. Your family can totally love him, but once he hurts you he is out the door. Best thing to do is during dinner or after dinner, tell them that you and your boyfriend talked about the problem, and you both realized that it was no one's fault but just a misunderstanding. Tell them that you both love each other very much and want to move forward in your relationship, even if it means fighting sometimes and being hurt, because you two will always get back together and be there for one another. Then at the end of your speech...thrust out your hand and show them the rock! Say "I am so happy!" Good Luck !!!! xoxo|`|z74wSbQoaa	Just tell the truth.  Let your family know you over reacted,etc.  Since you've been together for so many years, I'd hate to think one bad argument would ruin all those years of acceptance. It might be embarrassing, but before you know it everyone will be trying to plan the wedding for you.  :)|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	just grow some balls and tell them.|`|sJXjzgh5aa	have him show up at your doorstep, with flowers, and have family answer.  they'll be like "she doesnt want to see you/talk to you/whatever" and have him tell your family how much you mean to him.  get the family to realize again how great of a guy he is and they either he can say something like, 'ive realized i cannot live without her and i want to ask her to be my wife, if you (as in your family) will accept me back into your lives..." or something like that.  <br>  then go out with him and come home and tell the fam that your engaged. or he can repropose to you with the fam around.<br>  sounds sneaky but i know exactally what you mean about family having to accept your guy.  my parents can turn tables before a can even get a tear out which is conforting sometimes but mostly just difficult and fustrating.|`|dpk9n2SSaa	First, your family needs to realize that everyone makes mistakes. Be honest with them and let them know that you realize you were both at fault, that you still love him, that he apologized, that you are back together and that you both realized you want to be together so you are getting married! At first, they may be upset, but as they see you excitedly begin to plan your wedding, they will come around. Best wishes!|`|73fuqfSyaa	Tell them he apologized and you talked things through and realized you were both at fault first. Let them react to that, and when they calm down about him, you should tell them your engaged. You don't have to tell them right away, somethings are better left unsaid for awhile. Before you tell them, make sure they know things are good between you too and just let them calm down and turn that hate back to adoration!|`|AkUhaMm9aa	I think your family will understand..relationships are complicated sometimes..and they were saying those things about him because they are on your side and were not happy to see you so upset..whatever deciion you make they will be happy for you...so if you are happy and they love you tehey will be fine...just explain that you talked to him and things are working out...|`|lP04jzv6aa	the people who love you will always support you. good, bad or neutral. Just tell them the truth. These things happen.|`|36ZKn2bMaa	have him send flowers of apology and then you could both like take a cake with it written on it.|`|wIPdJ3eZaa	you should first tell your family that you are back together with him and why and then tell them you are engaged|`|MkErhX7Haa	Sounds to me like you have reason to believe that they will disapprove.  After that huge fight, it would be wise to cool off before diving into being engaged.  But what is done is done.  You should tell them, though.  Be honest.  Tell them you believe you worked through your problems and that you would appreciate their support, but understand if they need time to think it over.  If they don't react well, don't get mad or upset; it just reinforces their belief that it's a bad idea.  If they disapprove, tell them that you are sorry to hear that and you hope they come around.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|YFAPpzngaa	Don't worry about what your family thinks.  What YOU think is what's important here.  You are about to embark on one of the biggest journeys of your life.  Your family will "read" what is in your heart.  Despite the fact that both of you are no longer kids, and you have been together for 8 years, do you have anyone else to compare him to?  Is he your only really serious boyfriend? He's probably the only guy you have ever really known, because you have been with him since you were 15.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I would date someone else for awhile.  You don't know how good bronze is unless you compare it to gold or tin.  I'm not taking anything away from him...don't get me wrong.  He could be the best guy in the world, or he could be a schlub, but if you haven't tasted anything else on the menu, how can you know for sure?<br>  <br>  I was about the same age as you when I wanted to get married.  My mom thought that it was too quick for me.  She liked my girlfriend a lot, but she didn't think I had played the field enough and so consequently I had no one else to compare her to.  Turns out my mom was right.  I was in that "wrong" marriage for a long time.  I'm remarried now and this time to the best, most wonderful lady in the world.<br>  <br>  Be fair to yourself and to him.  You both should date someone else.  If you go back to each other then it was meant to be.  If either of you find someone else, then it wasn't meant to be.  If in the end he turns out to be the right one, your family will love him and welcome him. Good Luck!!|`|wf53TiSpaa	email|`|4POGapREaa	This should be a great lesson for you to keep your relationship issues private or at least to give an argument some time to die down before going to friends & family for a shoulder to cry on.  I learned that the hard way myself.  My husband never tells anyone when we're having issues whether he needs someone to talk to or not.  It's a big no no because it causes people to place judgments on someone that's not around to defend themselves or their position.<br>  <br>  With that out of the way, I would take responsibility for what you said to them & for your over reaction to the situation.  Simply tell your family that you want to apologize for coming to them without all of your facts straight first & that you want to take at least 1/2 the responsibility for the argument & hope that they don't think any less of him.  Tell them you feel bad about portraying him in a negative light & take responsibility for having done that.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	that's the problem with shooting your mouth off about your SO to family and friends when you are mad.  They only ever hear the bad stuff and never hear or see the good stuff.<br>  <br>  1.  you go to everyone you bad mouthed him to and you apologize to them for dragging them into your drama and tell them that you over reacted to something he did.  You let them know that he's apologized to you and made up to you for the misunderstanding.<br>  <br>  You promise them that you will never again do what you did a few days ago by trashing him to them just because the two of you had a little tiff.  (you only tell family when something MAJOR is going on--like he beats the ship out of you or he's a serial cheat.  You don't trash your SO to your family and friends because YOU over reacted to something.)<br>  <br>  2.  You give it a few days to a week to sink in and then you tell them that he proposed.<br>  <br>  This is all assuming that you are telling the truth now that you over reacted.  I find it hard to believe that your family and friends would turn on him so suddenly for one fight.  So you either trashed him good to them or this was one of many complaints they've had to hear about him and this was their final straw.
CwBLV9xoaa	Why don't you use it in front of him or have him use it on you, this way he'll get worked up with you and not in you. I love watching my wife use hers and just thinking about it I would love to watch her right know.

So therefore do the best thing for the marriage and get rid of the vibe, he most likely bought it for you as a way to compensate for his own feelings and tried to make it into a sexual thing for both of you. Although now it is working against him and your sexual happiness in general between the both of you. Since you have tried it in foreplay and other acts and it it still not helping the both of you seems it's time to get rid of it in general.|`|6wTfRlhlaa	you might have TMS (traumatic masturbation syndrome).<br>  its when you masturbate certain ways, and help damage how to receieve motions in actual intercourse.|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	tell him to learn how to lick box .....no toy can beat a good tongue<br>  <br>  toys are fun and all , but why do you think they call them toys? <br>  nothing like a clean shaved p*&#y to start your day right.<br>  <br>  cheers|`|u1uECuFNaa	I am not able to do it without one.

Go a little while without the toy. (weeks.) And have him touch you...<br>  perhaps with a fingertip vibe?

Eug52iQDaa	Your parents don't just want you to marry a Jewish boy - they're looking for doctor or lawyer, minimum *grin*.  You know the schpiel.  You're old enough to choose, of course.  However, the very real threat of losing your family should weigh on your decision too.  You do know that they mean what they say.  <br>  <br>  The only way that you're going to be able to marry him is with their blessing.  You're going to have to make them love him.  You can do it, if you really do love him.  It won't happen overnight, but with time and effort they'll see you with him and won't be able to deny you.  You are, after all, their little girl :)<br>  <br>  Good luck, sweetie!|`|4oeBAHANaa	I've heard alot about this before.<br>  and if you really love him, your going to have to give up your parents, but before you actually walk out on them, say somthing like.<br>  "mom dad, you know that I love you, and always will, but I love_____ too,,, (what ever his name is.) and im not going to stop loving him because he isn't the same religion as you. and I know that you want the best for me, so your support in being with ______ would be great, and I guess that if you dont' I'll understand."<br>   <br>  HOpe that I helped.|`|QkIfyLdgaa	Well it depends if you are atheist.

Iuy1eWyhaa	Do you get an allowance or anything like that? You might have to wait until you get a job, then you can save the money towards a bike and some new gear. Obviously, it's not going to happen overnight, but if you want something bad enough, and work towards achieving your goals then you know you can make it happen. <br>  Instead of asking for different gifts for birthdays/holidays, ask for some money to be deposited into a bank account that you can put money in towards it. <br>  Sorry I don't have a quick-fix answer for you, but you can do this, it will just take a bit of time. <--which you can use to find and compare different bikes etc.<br>  Check out craigslist.org in your area too.

ckJP6TTQaa	Its fine only if you are having a small casual wedding of mostly local family and family friends and the location is at a public park or at someone's home. <br>  <br>  It is definitely NOT okay if ANY of the following are true: <br>  <br>  1. Your guests are coming from out of town. (Very difficult to transport food on an airplane -- also difficult to keep food from spoiling on a long car ride...last thing you want is food poisoning at your reception!)<br>  <br>  2. Your wedding guest list is larger than 50. (Very few people can make a dish that is big enough to feed 120 people, so you run the risk of many people not getting to eat the dish that they want or there not being enough food because the family with 6 kids only brought a side dish that feeds 4 and a few of the guests couldn't cook anything at all, so they brought a box of doughnuts or just cash...things get complicated when your reception depends on the kindness of your guests and their schedules. Large potlucks also create confusion as to whose pie pan or crockpot is whose.)<br>  <br>  3. Your guests have dietary restrictions. (It's easy to tell a caterer, "we need a kosher meal" but it's hard to tell a crowd of people "make sure you label every ingredient in your dish so that the people with allergies or other restrictions will know...." and it's even harder to tell them, "Please don't eat any of these dishes until all the vegetarians have gotten a chance to eat.")<br>  <br>  4. Your reception is at a reception hall, museum....basically anywhere besides a person's home or a public park. (Most places that don't insist on using their own in-house caterer at least require that you be using a licensed and insured caterer.)<br>  <br>  5. You are expecting gifts. (If you are expecting people to cook you a meal, this is more inconvenient for them than to buy you a gift. Don't ask them to do both. This means asking your relatives and friends to refrain from throwing any showers -- where people would feel obligated to purchase a gift.)<br>  <br>  Other things to think about: <br>  <br>  -If you do not have caterers and waitstaff, who cleans up? <br>  -Will your guests feel unwelcome if they weren't able to cook something in time? Will they be looked upon as rude for not bringing something to share, when all they wanted was to pay their respects at your wedding? Guests are not even technically required to bring a gift, and so it would be very rude for you or any of your guests to make them feel uncomfortable for not being able to bring you a dish.<br>  -What will your reaction be if guests get food poisoning? Will you regret your decision if something unfortunate happens? With a caterer, you have someone who is legally responsible, but this is not the case for a potluck. <br>  -What are your other alternatives to help save money on the food budget? Perhaps having a late-night reception with only champagne and cake? Or having hors d'oeurve prepared by a few close friends and family who are good in the kitchen? Or having a backyard bbq with food that you get at a grocery store and enlisting a few friends to man the grill.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mJiO0LYyaa	i would happily bring food to a local backyard wedding, but i live in the deep south and more often than not, that's what we do here.<br>  <br>  i would provide the meat, beverages and wedding cake  and ask guests to bring the side dishes.<br>  <br>  that said, if she has on a 1000 dollar wedding dress and the wedding is in an expensive place, then no i would not bring food.<br>  <br>  i think you will have a strong geographic divide on this issue.|`|17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	This would be beyond tacky.<br>  <br>  You are supposed to provide for the comfort of your guests, including food and beverage and entertainment (band or DJ).

You don't ask guests to bring the food for themselves, omg, I would be so embarrassed. Buck up the money and get a caterer.|`|AaoclPYCaa	If its and informal wedding and most of the people are family I think it would be fine.  Just tell them to bring their favorite dish to share.|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	Only if it's in a barn somewhere complete with haystacks for seats & a picnic table for you & the Mrs.|`|lP04jzv6aa	If you are having a very informal wedding and its mostly family. sure. potlucks are fun|`|BJydER0gaa	Ummm... I think that's weird.|`|4POGapREaa	No, I have not.  Sounds more like a potluck for football Sunday.  If it was a close family member getting married, I would gladly do some cooking to pitch in.  But if I was invited by say a co-worker or if it was a friend of my husband's getting married & I had to cook for that, I wouldn't be too pleased.  I try not to put people's ideas or lifestyles down & I try not to be really strict about etiquette, but I think this is extremely tacky.  Your guest have already made arrangements to attend, some of them will buy a dress or whatever, get you wedding presents, and then they're supposed to transport food, and basically feed themselves & others?  No.  I just don't think it's a good way to thank your guests for their presence.  If you can't afford to do a plated meal, then do some appetizers & finger foods.  Even my grocery store does platters that are inexpensive & made ready for pickup.|`|NvW6voPJaa	Yes, I have.  It's called a potluck wedding.  However, in many parts of the country, this is totally against etiquette.  If you live in a small town (as I do) OR are having very, very close family and a few friends...then this is more acceptable.<br>  <br>  However, IF you were to do this, it would be best to have this be "in lieu of a gift."  Your guests cannot be expected to bring the food AND also a gift.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Not acceptable. You can have a family potluck in the summer if you want but you can't do that at your wedding. If anyone is from out of the area, they can't bring a casserole on the plane with them. You are hosting the event so you serve what you can afford and your guests are not expected to provide their own food and drinks. If you can't afford a full meal, just have cake and coffee.|`|nqINitkmaa	Perfectly acceptable?! Anything but!  It would be alright if you had your mother and a few of your aunts help you prepare a meal for all of your guests, but you NEVER ask guests to bring food! They are your GUESTS! I'm sorry save your self the embarrassment, and just do a cocktail reception or figure our a different way, this is just beyond tacky!<br>  <br>  " Your invited to come join us for dinner... Bring your own food!" Your fiance needs to get his head checked!|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Ouch. Not a good idea.

YsiJiOqXaa	Well that's about my budget and we are planning for at least 125 people there. I did most of the centerpieces, candles and decorations myself. The invitations I did myself. I have a friend that is a DJ and a photographer.  And we are doing the food ourselves with the help of family and doing cupckes(much cheaper than a cake). If you get crafty with things you can save a lot. Good luck!|`|qK91Vd2Eaa	You can probably invite over 100 w/ that budget and I say 50 and under is considered a small wedding your wedding can still be a really nice w a 4000 budget some people get really fancy and have these big *** budgets and their wedding look so boring and lame its not about how much you have but what you can do w/ what you do have and you can do a lot trust me spend most the money on good food and a good dj the recpetion is the most memorable and should be the most fun part and in my opinon also don't get hella big centepieces do lots of candles and few calla lillies or pieones the simple stuff looks the best sometimes people tend to over do things and doesn't look good don't forget to save your honeymoon everyone I know says they wished they would have spent less on their wedding and more on their honeymoon<br>  <br>  Sorry you didnt ask for all this advice but hey jus thot id help good luck!|`|ckJP6TTQaa	It really depends entirely on what kind of wedding you are having and how expensive things are in your area. Basically, there are costs that don't have ANYTHING to do with the number of guests. For example, a photographer usually doesn't charge based on the number of guests, but rather based on the hours that they are working. <br>  <br>  Overall, the expenses for which the number of guests is irrelevant are: <br>  <br>  1. Photographer and/or videographer<br>  2. Clothes and alterations<br>  3. Hair and Makeup for bride <br>  4. Transportation <br>  5. License<br>  6. Officiant's fee<br>  7. Rings<br>  8. DJ or Band or Stereo Equipment and dance floor rental<br>  9. Ceremony musicians<br>  10. Gifts for attendants, parents, etc<br>  <br>  <br>  The expenses for which you might be able to save money with fewer guests are: <br>  <br>  1. Ceremony and Reception location rental fees (most likely won't be able to save much here, since these are usually flat rates, but you might have more options if you don't need a large site to accomodate all your guests...)<br>  2. Cake (again, you'll have to pay for decoration and delivery and whatnot no matter how many guests you have, etc but you should theoretically be spending less if you have a smaller cake that serves fewer people)<br>  3. Food (style and presentation aren't dependent on guest numbers, but amount certainly is -- and you will need more waitstaff if you have more people)<br>  4. Flowers (some decor isn't dependent on the number of guests...like bridesmaid bouquets and bridal bouquet....but other decor -- like centerpieces -- depends on how many people will be there.)<br>  5. Beverages <br>  6. Invitations and other stationary  (in most cases, you pay less per piece after the initial printing, so if you buy in bulk you spend less per invitation overall....so you might not save all that much money if you have fewer guests)<br>  <br>  I don't mean to scare you, but we are spending twice your wedding budget just for the food for our wedding of 135 guests. In fact, I know of photographers in my area that charge $4,000. So it really depends on your wedding style. I'm sure it's possible to put together a wedding for $4,000 but it will probably mean getting a friend do to the photography, having a casual backyard reception, and/or inviting a very select number of friends. Again, it also depends on where in the country you live...I live in a major metropolitan area, so things are probably more expensive than in other locations. <br>  <br>  Also, I consider a small wedding to be under 100 guests on the invite list.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	A lot of that depends on you.  But I'll tell you what I think.<br>  <br>  I think for that price you could probably "pull off" inviting 150 people, but it would require major cuts everywhere else.  Like  the photographer, dress, dj, reception, food etc etc.  We are barely pulling ours off for 75 on a $2000 budget.  My dress was under $200, he is wearing a suit he already owned, we are having a pot luck style reception, and the reception is in the back yard....and I haven't figured out the rest cause we are running out of money lol  <br>  <br>  I would think 20-30 people as a small wedding.   But that's because I see something like 200 as a big wedding, others might feel differently.|`|St7Y2Ldkaa	My sister's first wedding cost us under $2000 and we invited 150 people! We did everything ourselves. We made invitations, food, decorations, favors! It was so much fun and it was simple! The dresses were beautiful and all found on sale! You just have to get creative with it and you can do it!|`|dcf22abaabe712c7c6abd9464ff58ab2aa	You can add to your guest count by looking for sales on bridal gowns at places like David's Bridal and making your own invitations and center pieces.  Some of the items you find at wedding stores are the same items at the Dollar Tree.|`|rZXQvA75aa	My budget was $4,000 also. We had and outdoor wedding and a reception at the same park. The food was catered (but buffet style) and we had 120 guests.|`|76nTvO4iaa	What are you planning to do for your reception?  If you're planning to serve a meal and don't live in an outrageously priced area, you could invite 40-50.<br>  <br>  50 and under is a small wedding where I live.|`|4POGapREaa	Totally depends on so many different things.  Our cost was 10k for 50 guests but that was going to be at a restaurant overlooking the water with a photographer, great food, DJ, awesome cake, etc. and I also live in Southern California so it's a bit costly around here.  If we had chosen to do a backyard affair & used music from an Ipod or whatever, we could have easily doubled our guest list.  You need to first decide what's more important to you.  Do you want more people or do you want a really special night for a select few?|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	50-75 is considered small.<br>  <br>  You have to factor in food/drink, attire, decorations, music, etc. It also depends where you live and thus what you are going to have to pay for those services. You could do a cake and punch reception with that amount easily. If you must have a meal, you will either have to DIY a spaghetti dinner, order in pizzas, or get a ton of heavy appetizers from the frozen section of Costco (15-20 pieces per person is actually the equivalent of two full meals per person and the expected amount to serve during the dinner hour if you go that route).|`|AA10378447	Is that your entire budget or your FOOD budget?<br>  <br>  If it's the food budget, you could invite up to 130 people and they could have some nice meal choices.<br>  <br>  If that's the entire wedding budget, you're looking at a guest list of probably no more than 50-55 people to keep costs under control. And, with that, you'll need to spend much less on the meal and/or refreshments.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	If you lived in my area, you might be able to have 20 - 30 people if you were having a dinner wedding and you really skrimped and cut corners on other areas.<br>  <br>  But is the $4k your reception budget or your whole wedding budget?  If it is only for the reception, then you could probably have about 50-60 people.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	It depends on your area and how much you spend on other things like photography, DJ, attire, etc. Honestly, that is a very small budget.<br>  <br>  Try this website:<br>  <br>  www.costofwedding.com

The project could also involve the parents. <br>  <br>  We had the same problem in my kids' school and that's what the teacher did.

But, knowing that wouldn't set a very good example for my kid...I'd first make sure she knew how special she is (which I'm sure you do), and then, I'd go to the school, and see what the flip is wrong with her teacher that she would allow such behavior. Teachers know what their students are up to, in class or at recess. Your girl's teacher needs to take charge...and so do the parents. Kids tend to mimic their parents. If the parents know what is going on, I bet 8 out of 10 of them would be embarrassed by their child's behavior and would explain to their kid why they can't behave this way. It's up to the adults, and unfortunately, you're first.|`|CMo0Fh1Zaa	this is what I would do.   I would get together with the officials at that school, tell them what is happening, and demand that they put on a school assembly where all the kids are together, and teach them about her condition,  what your daughter has to go through physically/mentally, and kind of make it where these kids are put in your daughter's shoes.   Kids don't know unless they are taught.   And maybe if you can get the school officials to cooperate you can get these kids to understand better.

Low light in the house, soft music, great dinner served with all the nice silverware out, wear something extremely sexy (it could be a small outfit he really likes or even something like lingerie) something that will send the message of things to come after dinner. One thing important ... tease ... but do not let him eat the cake ... yet.<br>  make it last, go through all the steps. take the time. really have dinner, really have a glass of wine after wards sit on the sofa together ... talk and let the desire take over. you will fulfill his dream night.<br>  Cons: be ready to give him for "more of that" because he will not forget this night and will want many more of the same.<br>  Good luck ... and good "night"|`|oKrNOazLaa	I'm not marrie but men like sex the most.

As far as romanced, I know I'm shy to a point until my other head starts thinking for me. I don't know if your into toys but using a toy infront of your husband will get the juices flowing and then letting him help you with the toy can drive everybody nuts- at that time you might want to have extra batteries on hand. Long hot showers together aways helps get things going, nothing wrong with some clean fun and then bring him to bed.

He was in a serious relationship with his girlfriend in high school.  I always thought he might have a crush on me.  I know his girlfriend thought I was a threat to the relationship.  Their relationship continued after high school, they had children, got married, and are divorced.<br>  <br>  When my mom saw him she was asked if I had a crush on him.  I think he still has a crush on me and it's been almost 10 years.  I never wanted to intrude on his relationship.  I can't believe he may still be holding onto a crush after so many years.<br>  <br>  If your husband has a crush on someone I think it's better to leave it in the past.  It's hard to know what people's intentions are sometimes.  If a friendship is possible (while still respecting your marriage) that's great.  Many people want more than friendship so be cautious about keeping in contact.|`|307e654ccfed84729fca6808c7267d23aa	You want him to leave the past behind but you invite her to your housewarming??

If you husband doesn't feel comfortable with her or had something with her he has his reasons. If something similiar was to happen to you. You would want your husband to respect your decisions. This is a marriage and both of you should respect each others decisions. Just leave it alone. IF they start acting weird around each other and you start something "how are you going to feel?"  I'm sure you husband loves you, but there is always a first love. I don't think he would be unfaithful, but why bring those vibes to a loving home?
speJXeIhaa	It's really sad that they are invading your dreams like this- sadly though,i don't think there's much you can do.They've already decided to be where you are going to be- is it a case of not wanting to let their son 'go'? maybe they don't fully appreciate the fact that their child now has a family of his own and doesn't need them in the same way anymore.I truly think all you can do is just try not to let these bullies get to you so much,certainly don't let them start getting between you and your boyfriend.Don't bite your tongue though,but on the other hand don't say so much that your life in YOUR dream will become unbearable.Keep them at a distance and hope that the slower pace in life will mellow them.<br>  <br>  Sorry i haven't been much help,best wishes though =)|`|zdu3gh8jaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Continue with your plans to move abroad. When you get there don't bother giving them a phone number or contact details and just get on with living your new lives. When they move over, again don't give them details of contact and in the event that they already know your new address etc always be too busy to join them on days out family gatherings and what not. You and your husband decide when, where and how long you see them and if that means once every month or so then so be it. This move will be a new start for you, make that obvious by setting ground rules immediately and sticking with them. Let them say what they want about you, the more difficult they are , the greater the chance they stand of losing all contact whatsoever.<br>  Good Luck and I truly hope all goes well for you when you move.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	can you change your destination? they may not want to go now. also you should tell them, you want to do this on your own. you were doing this so you could both discover the world independantly. they need to give you guys some time away.

My inlaws are like that too, but the difference is my husband sides with his mom or tells me I'm overreacting. I have been married to him for 17 years, and it has always been like this. The best you can do is what you are doing. Speak up when you have to, avoid them when you can, and focus on your new life. Protect the kids from the negativity when you can, and when they ask about it, say "she's just like that." You can't take responsibility for other people's attitudes. The best you can do is protect yourself from them. Enjoy your life. Try not to react too strongly, but don't pretend like it isn't there either. Good luck.|`|fshRuXzmaa	Your major problem is your boyfriend.  If he doesn't have the balls to tell his mom and dad to p**s off (as tactfully as possible, but strongly enough that they understand), then you have little choice but to get along with them.<br>  <br>  Best thing would be if you can convince your boyfriend to ask them to remain where they are, that he is trying to start fresh, and will visit periodically, etc.  Much depends on if you can convince him.  If he is basically a momma's boy, then he can never tell them that he would rather that they not come along, and you are pretty much f****d.|`|hm4oU8bDaa	This is a long story. All the while, while I was reading this I was thinking what would I do.<br>  You were honest. Honesty is the best in a relationship. Since they're going to move in your dream place, don't let them stop you from doing so. Still, picture them without them there, living in your dream. DOn't let other people affect your life. That is your dream home. <br>  Still you're going to see them so there is nothing to really do. But still be nice to them. Send them holiday cards. Cook dinner on holidays. Invite them over. Even if they ruin your day, still be nice. <br>  When his parents get sick, they're going to come to you for help. Be there for them. Be there for them through everything THICK or THIN.<br>  They'll soon find trust and learn to love you.

It is VERY BAD, anti-religious, unethical  & immoral making you worst characterless person. do you know any difference between a man & a dog ? It is not like taking a cup of tea. By doing so, you dishonour a virgin girl, damage severely her chastity &  modesty to the worst & torture her emotionally, physically & psychologically which is irreversible. If you have a young sister & she also faces such traumatic phase of life, will your mind tolerate that ? By having such intimate relation with someone, after marriage, particularly at first night, you have no natural love, interest, enthusiasm, curiosity, craze & emotionally charged up intensity in the body, mind & soul. That night passes like an ordinary one.  Your wife afterwards will love you deeply & you will not care much. Imagine the life afterwards when she comes to know of that & start hating you too b coz during half sleeping conditions these past happenings come out of mouth & spouse certainly comes to know that.It is natural , you can't escape. It is just like a drunkard murmurs all secret things while sleeping. God's arrangement is such that cheaters get punishments somehow sooner or later. If you want to do so, never marry.<br>  You should have asked the question as : Is becoming characterless before marriage is good or bad ? The answer is obvious. Only foolosh girls surrender to such boys. By chance if they get pregnant, who suffers most ?|`|1HTRWrawaa	You have to do what is best for YOU, not what is good for someone else.<br>  <br>  If it's really important for you to be a virgin when you get married then do it.<br>  <br>  My sister and I each waited until marriage. My wedding night was a nightmare. My sister was sorry she waited. Her marriage lasted 6 months and she said if she had known her husband was going to be so bad in bed, she never would have married him.<br>  <br>  The second time around, we both decided we wanted to know exactly what we were going to get in bed BEFORE we said "I do."<br>  <br>  It's up to you, but if I could go back to the beginning, I would never marry someone I had never had sex with.

scyLaz0saa	Your 17 and your hormones are going crazy so that could be the reason for the way you are feeling.  First try masturbation.  Many girls and guys do this to get through those "dry spells".  So I would suggest that would be a good place to start.  As for respecting your girl for taking it slow, good for you.  Not many guys would do that and I give you brownie points for being a stand up guy here.  As for Slow? what does she mean by that?  If you are unsure about how slow you both you are taking it I would get clarification.  However do not and NEVER push her to have sex.  Also be sure when you do have sex it be safe and you are ready to accept all the possible consequences that come with sex.  Good luck to you.|`|p8otQ2vuaa	if she wants to take things slow then let it be<br>  but you are wanting some, so...<br>  you two have a serious talk, and ask her about it.<br>  say that you are not forcing her to do it, and ask her (after) if she got scared about the conversation.<br>  if she doesn't approve, don't beg. go masterbate|`|Fmebuub7aa	so sweet...<br>  <br>  depends on how old your gf is...if she's the same age as you maybe you should bring it up...she's old enough...has she had sex before?<br>  <br>  I know this sounds so cliche but be romantic, roses, candles, dinner, whispering sweet nothings into her ear, i know i fell for it when i was 17 <br>  <br>  and to answer your question...you may be sexually frustrated 17 year old boys need to ya know...let it out ha...|`|sIGZsy8caa	at 17 i was masturbating maybe you should do that aswell as being in this relationship ?<br>  <br>  it will help control how much desire you have to poke your wood into the fire if you catch my drift ? wood <br>  <br>  maybe just wait till you and her are a bit tipsy and ask her if shes ready etc|`|kqxddLNoaa	Talk to me babe.

But maybe you could just suggest for her to try sex if she wanted to? If not, there are other ways to show her you love her. It seems that you want sex, but you must respect her as well. I think you just want that great feeling from sex, but it IS possible to refrain from it for some time. Just go with the flow, and try to make your girl feel easy with you, and maybe, she will be ready. If she is a virgin, there is no rush to sex or love. Good luck.|`|IFd94XDkaa	Are you masturbating?  It isn't as good as sex with a partner but it should releive the stress a bit at least.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	play with your self|`|AA11085356	Do you masturbate? If you're not having sex, it could help... As far as talking to your girlfriend about it, why not? I mean as long as you don't come out and say 'I wanna f*ck you' you should be fine. Just ask her what her boundaries are. It's okay to be open in a relationship and talk about those kinds of things. And there is also nothing wrong with taking things slowly! You should be proud of yourself for that. Not a lot of guys would 'waste' their time with someone who isn't ready for that next step. But if I were you, I would relieve yourself, then talk to your girl in the morning. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|asXHWTK6aa	you and internet porn will become great friends my friend..... <br>  <br>  My girlfriend is the same way, she starts crying when i push myself against her cuz she tells me no and she considers it rape and i feel bad at times, soo i just make friends with porn and my right hand.... try that buddy lol<br>  <br>  I hope i helped, if so, please vote for my answer to be "best answer" thank you!!!|`|6cm6MB66aa	Well guys at your age are just hitting there prime . you get the blue balls and all that come with it  cramps the hole shot .

I would, however, be honest about your attraction to her. It isn't wrong to tell her how much you want her. This is also very flattering! If you put the ball in her court you will know where she stands and if she's getting any closer to ready! I also think a little romance helps. Obviously you want to be absolutely certain she's ready so that she doesn't just do it for you and then regret it. Express your feelings and continue to be patient with her. And yes...masturbation does help -if worse comes to worse -I know solo sex doesn't always cut it, but it's better than nothing at all.
qcy86nbcaa	dont ever give up on love ! especially because your only 25. it may seem like thats the perfect age to get married, but most people who get married this young end in divorce. you will find the perfect guy for you and he'll probably show up when you least expect it .so untill mr. right comes along dont give up! , just enjoy the life your living ! who knows he may be waiting for you just around the corner !!!|`|nBGjPwViaa	It happens to everyone.<br>  I had to make my mind up that I was NOT going to close off emotionally and spiritually.<br>  I had two failed marriages...The third one is a keeper!!!<br>  But I had to change the entire idea I had of "the perfect man" that was in my head...|`|St7Y2Ldkaa	I was previously engaged to a man I had been with for years. After 6 months of dating he started to become controlling. It got worse and worse until there was mental, verbal, and emotional abuse along with the threat of physical abuse.

I'd had my heart ripped to shreds by my then fiance who would cheat on me and lie to me and abuse me. Eventually I left him to be with my fella.<br>  <br>  Don't ever give up on love.

hs793CCxaa	It came from lust and convenience. The thought we can get right down to it when ever we feel like it, and neither has to go home afterwards. <br>  <br>  I feel it is good, so couples can try it out and see if they are compatible. BUT it is also not so good, in that couples tend to have more sex, fall pregnant and have children before they are really ready as a couple. How often do you see couples getting married for the first time, with several children? <br>  <br>  To have a strong marriage, the couple needs to REALLY know each other. REALLY know each other. To be together for several years, WITHOUT children. <br>  <br>  We all know children are passion killers, and often once a child appears, the frequent lovemaking disappears for years and years, IF the marriage survives. Men and women have different agendas, different needs, and children only fulfill one of the people's needs when had early on.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  To the answerer below, if you don't know whether or not your personalities are compatible without living together, you already have big problems that won't be solved by living together!|`|OHfZFR31aa	Plenty of bad marriages are prevented by people living together before marriage.

People want a connection, the companionship, and the security of sharing their life with someone, but they are also scared to death to commit for fear that the marriage will change things and make it more difficult to just split if things go bad.<br>  <br>  Marriage itself is a civil or religious ceremony... it does not guarantee love in a relationship. Many people choose to live together and are just as devoted as any legally married couple. Usually if kids start coming into the picture most couples decide to wed because it clears up a lot of legal and custodial issues concerning children... not to mention that the actual bond of marriage is reassuring for the children as well.<br>  <br>  Later in life some choose to live together simply because separately from one another they both have a lifetime of possessions, holdings, and assets that they both want to remain separate... Often a person that might have one, two, or even a few ex's changes their mind about the choice to wed another person.|`|i5Vn3lQLaa	I dont know where the idea came from, but i am thankful that it's a reality. You dont explain why it's not adventageous for women ? What about for men? <br>  <br>  THis is great though, it's evolutionary. How else are two adults supposed to know whether they will be able to stomach eachother? Whether or not the personalities are compatible? IF more people lived together first and figured out whether the relationship is goign to be a healty one and suitable for both, then there would definitely be less divorcee's|`|Q8LhpzuHaa	Im not to sure where it came from , but I know when I was younger <br>  living together  wasn't  something all did ..

kUE3Ddktaa	Not always.<br>  <br>  At least one person in the couple must be a confirmed Catholic, but it's up to the priest as to whether the non-Catholic must convert.

AA11621340	There can be little to no effect or there can be lasting issues of trusting men for a very long time. In some cases, this could have a serious effect on her ability to develop secure, trusting, loving relationships with a man in her future. I guess it would depend on two factors: How old the girl was at the time & just how much she knew & understood about what happened, or what she learned about it & how she learned about it as she got older.<br>  <br>  First, though children do not need to know the cause, never assume that they are too young to figure it out. They see & hear things adults never realize they have!<br>  <br>  Once a child knows about the affair, how the parents both handle it will make a huge difference. Does dad still pay attention to her - without the new girlfriend around? or does she need to "share" her daddy" Tough concept for a girl who thinks dad's world revolves around her & mom! If the child is very young, you might be able to explain that mom & dad just can't get a;long well enough to live together & they will both have new "friends" - though any child past the age of 5 will be too savvy for that for long!<br>  <br>  Just beware that all divorces, all affairs, do affect the entire family - including the children! The best bet would before the parents to talk to the child & to seek counseling for her as it appears necessary - or even as a preventive measure.|`|AA10065812	Whether or not there was infidelity, 85% of the children of divorce develop significant behavioral problems, especially if they are denied access to their father.

Some kids tend to take sides and it usually depends on the parents behavior as to who they side with and always want to be with. My kids see their dad and his new wife continuously starting trouble, gossiping to his family about me and my new husband, and the list goes in. My daughter is not a fan of this. My son doesn't really pay attention to it as much. Girls tend to be a little more emotional. My kids are both age 12. My ex husbands new wife also has 3 kids from a previous marriage. She keeps her kids from their dad and bad mouths him too. Her kids are very bitter, especially the oldest who is 13. What the both of them (my ex and his new wife) don't understand is that they are the ones who will have a lifetime of hurt and regrets if the don't stop now.

I'm sure you've made that threat before, you just haven't followed through. Also, many abused women later say it didn't happen because they choose to stay with the wife beater. I'm sure he did it, and jail would be instructive for your son. Quit being such a doormat.|`|xQn3rR6Naa	Time to grow up and not rely on Mom and older brother anymore. Tell him you will expect that he either gets a job to pay his own bills or you will allow him to get himself out of jail. If he has to serve the sentence then he will have decided that for himself and that he will have to find other accommodations to live in . Get the locks changed and put his stuff in his car if he has one. If not tell him that you are renting a storage lot for 3 months and then his belongings will be sold at auction. Your older son needs to understand that you are doing this for your troublesome son and him as well and that if he allows his brother to return to the rent house without a job and first months rent before he crosses the threshold , the you will have to put both of them out so the cure for laziness can take hold.|`|2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	The intervention sounds like a good idea.  However, you may need to let the bail be revoked and let him learn a valuable lesson.  I have 2 sons, aged 20 and 22.  You have to practice "tough love" and let them suffer the consequences of their bad choices. And believe me, I know it can be very hard to do that.  My sons are much more respectful than they used to be and have matured quite a bit in the last 2-3 years. Both of them hold a full time job and one is also taking college classes. My oldest son especially used to always expect a bail out from me or his father, but when we told him we weren't doing that anymore, (and didn't) he started making better choices.

You absolutely should not be taking care of him like he's still a child. He's a man now, and needs to start acting like one. He wants to be a rapper, huh? That IS a waste of time. He might do well to be reminded that maybe one in a thousand, or even ten thousand, ever "make it" in the business. Sounds like he just wants a life of leisure. Don't we all?<br>  Hate to say it, but you've allowed him to be like this. You've made life way too easy for him, and obviously bailed him out every time he'd get in trouble. Stop!<br>  Cut him loose. Give him the ultimatum. He's basically got only two choices now: conservation corps or jail. (a third choice might be the military. They can straighten him out.)<br>  Don't offer any other options. Don't let him talk you into anything else. Be tough. If he storms out, let him know he's not welcome back in your home until he's straightened out.<br>  If you let him slide any more, he'll be doomed to be like this forever.<br>  I'm guessing that his girlfriend is the same. Maybe her mother ought to cut her loose too.<br>  Glad to hear you're in remission, BTW. Best wishes.|`|jzpqxrlCaa	you are on the right track just stick with it.This is your chance he is up against the wall now. Good Luck!!!!. you could tell him how much you love him and that if you don't stick to this he will never be a man and stand on his own 2 feet.
b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	1. You are young. Have you ever dated anyone else seriously before? I was convinced my graduate school boyfriend was "the one," but now that I am happily married to another man, I realize that I was compromising on a lot of things.<br>  <br>  2. You have to decided how long is too long for you. My husband proposed to me after 10 months of dating; we were married about 25 months of dating. He told me he wanted me to move in with him after 3 months of dating. I didn't move in until 8 months, but basically, we talked about things very soon.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	We were 23 and 24 when we got together, and we also didn't see ourselves getting married for a while.  For me, it was never much of a question that he wanted to marry me.  We had been good friends before we became a couple, and he had a crush on me first.  Even then, I kind of knew that he was hoping to marry me someday.  I couldn't tell you how anymore.  He was never said anything that blatant about it, but it was obvious he liked me a lot.<br>  <br>  When we started dating, I knew he was thinking of marrying me someday because he would bring up questions like when did I hope to be married, how many children did I want, etc.  Sometimes he'd talk about our future together as though it was something he was expecting.  As we dated longer, we just talked openly about what our level of confidence that we'd be married with each other, and it was usually pretty high.  At one point, he even let out slip that he'd been looking at engagement rings.  Those were all the biggest clues for me.  <br>  <br>  I had been pretty confident from day one of when I started dating him that we'd be married.  We ended up getting engaged six and a half years later, and it wasn't really a surprise.  We'd talked in advance about where we wanted to be in our lives when we got engaged and had known for a while we'd be engaged when we got there.<br>  <br>  As far as whether he called me everyday, not at all.  He really hates phones and wouldn't even call more than twice a year.  We were even in a long distance relationship, but he would just IM me and we would visit each other for a few days each month, but I almost never got to speak to him on the phone.|`|QdCwBSVQaa	How long did you date for?  Almost 3 years.<br>  <br>  When was the proposal?  2004<br>  <br>  Were you expecting it?  Not on the day he proposed, but I knew it would be soon.<br>  <br>  Did you always know you would end up together?  After the first 8 months, yes.<br>  <br>  Did you have to work for the other persons affection?  No. We have a very similar sense of humor, and we always treat each other with kindness.<br>  <br>  Did they call you everyday?  Yes, usually more.  Even now, we talk at least twice during the work day by phone.<br>  <br>  What was their behavior towards you like?  I made no demands on his "guy" time, but he always made me a priority. He would do nice things for my family (take my elderly parents to doctors' appointments).  He always included me in family gatherings.<br>  <br>  What are some ways to tell we are heading in that direction?  We traveled together internationally, we were involved with each others' families, we made long-term financial plans together (e.g., figured out budgets so we could save for a house), only interviewed for jobs that were geographically desirable for both of us.  We made sure we were on the same page with the BIG deal-killer issues:  religion, having kids, and handling money (i.e., do you both have the same philosophy on saving vs. spending and how much debt you are willing to carry).
2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	First off, I don't think 6 months is long enough to date before getting engaged. Keep your head on straight and be patient. You are right, you need to finish school and get a stable job. <br>  My husband and I dated almost 5 and 1/2 years before he proposed to me. Actually, we talked about it after dating 2 years, but wanted to wait until my sons were finished with school and getting settled into adulthood.  I knew after our first couple of dates that he was the one I wanted to marry, but it took him quite a bit longer to come around. <br>  Most of the time we at least talked on the phone every day. We just took our time.  There were times that I about gave up on him, but then he would do or say something that would make me be a little more patient. At the beginning of our fifth year dating, I started praying and finally was able to accept the fact the he and I might only just be very good friends, and told God that if that was all He had for us, that I would be content with that. So I changed my focus away from wanting to be married, to just working on improving myself. Next thing I know, my boyfriend proposed very unexpectedly on Valentine's Day and just totally blew me away. We were married 6 months later in August. <br>     My advice is to just be patient, concentrate on school and getting your adult life together. If you are to be married, it will happen in God's timing. <br>  Best Wishes.
kfWi9ZkEaa	You have 2 options.<br>  <br>  1. call the cops<br>  2. raise him yourself.  <br>  <br>  Your mother is completely useless, she is beyond incompetent and can safely be ignored.  More about what to do with her later...<br>  <br>  With 2: you are going to have to go to him and say "if you lay a finger on my little sister ever again, or interfere with her belongings in any way, you are going to have to deal with me going forward."<br>  <br>  His wariness of you, you will have to extend over your little sister like a loving umbrella.  "You hurt her, that hurts me.  You don't want to hurt me, do you?  Nooooo...."<br>  <br>  If you have to smack him one, you smack him one.  And if he tells and you get a hiding: you smack him one for that too.  He needs to know it's not worth it to him to blab.  Your mother needs to know that whether she likes it or not, you're not going to watch him pick on your little sister without doing anything.  Tell your mother what you think of her: but calmly.  Tell her that due to her incompetence, bias and stupidity you were inches away from calling the police about how yr brother treats the sister.  mummy needs a wakeup: you're the only one around.  It sucks, but it's down to you.<br>  <br>  What is wrong here is not psychological: it's a power paradigm.  he's a teenager, hormonal, aggressive beyond belief (lots of it hormones but lots of it arrogance as well.)  He needs to fear a reaction in order to consider what he is going to do each time.  He also needs belted into his ears (ie by being told, no actual belts) that his little sister is alive as well, has rights, and you, personally, will defend those rights.<br>  <br>  When he gets some sort of clear idea of reality, he will calm down.  He's on what's called a power trip at the moment, and you have to fight power with power, and not go into caring sharing crap like your mother probably does because she's read stupid books about raising boys.<br>  <br>  ultimately, if this boy had a father, dad would give him an unpleasant experience whenever he so much as lifted a finger to the sister.  You either become this father, act out his role;  or else pass the problem on to someone who can.  Tell your brother what is going to happen going forward, and if you can't solve the situation you will tell the police because you WILL have your sister defended.  Tell your mother this.  Call a family meeting if you can: say that this is now beyond your ability to endure and so you won't be enduring it any more, these are the options, which ones do they want to follow?  Be strong, be real, this is what it is all about, showing people the true consenquences of their actions.  Showing them the actual truth, instead of the one they want to think is true.<br>  <br>  And also: on the qt: look at your little sister.  Is there anything she can do to reduce the number of attacks?  BEWARE thinking that the aggressor is always the bad guy, sometimes the 12-yr-old is unthinkingly doing something which really, really upsets the teenaged boy.  You must operate on his side as much as against him.  you must squash his attacks, BUT THEN YOU MUST find out what set him off, what happened that caused it. There will be some genuine problem in there he cannot express, or he doesn't think you'll understand.  12-yr-old sisters can be totally insufferable without really realising it.  They have to see things from each other's point of view and that INCLUDES HER SEEING THINGS FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW.  If he doesn't feel valued or listened to in any way, HE WILL JUST KEEP GETTING WORSE.<br>  <br>  Sorry for all the caps by the way:  just trying to make my point and the machine wont' allow italics or bold or anything.....<br>  <br>  Whew!  Good luck.<br>  <br>  And make him make reparation if you can although you may not be able to.  See what can be done.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	Noooooooo! Don't call the cops just wait until your mom comes home!  You probably will make your mom very mad. Your brother definitely needs help.  Have you tried talking to the school counselor for your self and maybe they can help?|`|cmwmjskfaa	If you think he's really doing the wrong thing, then yes. Hope I helped!|`|jqZY0OyPaa	Call the cops if he's so out of control. If your mom can't raise him right, at least they'll teach him a lesson. <br>  <br>  How bad was your sister beat? Would she need a medic?|`|QsMOikN6aa	Well you should! If he's beating the crap out of your little sister, that's like abusing a little kid! and if he's stealing her money tell her to hide her money . <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  AND YOU SHOULD CALL THE COPS! But . if your mom answers the phone tell her what is happening around the house or if your mom has a different cell phone . But i really guess you should because if you don't call the cops.. think what he might do to you or your little sister D:|`|jzpqxrlCaa	sounds like your mom could control him if she would.I would talk to my mom and just get her to see exactly what is what. tell her that if she doesn't do something with him that you have no choice but to call the authorities.If he doesn't get diciplined now he will really be in trouble later. Good luck!!!|`|HNmKgYnUaa	Oh my.<br>  <br>  This is a matter for Child Services.<br>  They are going to come and the little sister and brother away and put hem into foster homes.<br>  <br>  I think this would be the best thing for you and your mother b/c she is not a good mother.<br>  <br>  Please try and call them they could really be useful in this situation before someone gets injured really badly.|`|hcc8fq7jaa	Your mother is foolish for coddling him like that. SHE'S the one who created the monster. There are no repercussions for his bad behavior, which is why he keeps acting up. That's Mom's fault.<br>  Personally, I would call the police. He's out of control. <br>  You have an obligation to protect your little sister from harm. Since your mother won't do it, you have to. Let the police know what's going on. Let them see the bruises on your sister. They can and should take him into custody. Let them talk to your mother about her responsibilities. <br>  Did you ever ask your mother why she lets him beat up your little sister, but would get mad at you for hitting him? I thinks she's pathetic. <br>   BTW, I don't know why you don't talk to your father's family, but it might be a good time to get in touch with them. It's a good idea to have an uncle or male cousin around who can keep him in line. He needs an "alpha male" to keep him in his place.
qPmQvqJXaa	Answer this question:  If I found out tomorrow that she could never have sex with me again, and she'd need me to help take care of her, would I want to be there for her?  If you wouldn't, then don't marry her.  There lots of reasons a woman can't have sex during a marriage (ie, endometriosis, pregnancy complications, cancer, etc.).  If that dynamic was taken away, would you still want to share your life with her?|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	LMFAO. thanks for the laugh tonight I sure needed one...hey...pheromones are some powerful chemicals....enjoy the flight.<br>  <br>  Look up Eros Love vs. Agate Love....you are experiencing Eros.|`|yQfaj7c2aa	What I suggest you do is to stop having sex with her completely right now, I know this will be difficult; but see if you guys can spend time together enjoying each others company without the sex. You will see how much you have in common, if you can truly communicate, and if she is intriguing to you -beyond the sex. Set a time limit like 6 weeks to see how you guys do. If you have great sex now, you will still have great sex in 6 weeks, but it is worth the experiment to find out if she is someone you can commit the rest of your life to. Take it from me, after being married for awhile the sex won't be as heated as it is now, but the true reward comes from actually liking your partner and having something to talk about. They always say that you have to have something to fall back on when the spark turns to a soft glow...this is true! I can tell that you have very strong feelings -this could be why the sex is so good, but you can't let the sex muddle your brain when you are considering a commitment as large as marriage!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!!|`|sCCjAKllaa	If you really love her, don't fight your feelings. It might not be love if the sex is the only thing that generates this powerful feeling; but if you honestly think you can be with her, then you should at least give it a try.<br>  <br>  However, if you were together, and the sex kinda hit a limit, as in not being nearly as strong as it was, things could go bad. Be careful, bro.|`|dc5bTUtmaa	you could lay off the sex for a while, like say until you are married, give you time to figure out if you love n' respect her as a whole human being. But l figure you are too immature for such a heavy commitment, no disrespect meant, so what's the rush?|`|YzObEmUqaa	She blows you good, eh?<br>  Making you confused<br>  shock and awe...<br>  If so, you might be trapped<br>  by her love making style, eh.<br>  <br>  Be careful<br>  some women would do that to trap a man in <br>  a relationship.....|`|Ctgc429laa	you shouldnt have to question whether or not you love the woman youre about to marry.  <br>  <br>  talk to her about this.  because its not fair to her if you marry her.  <br>  think about it, shes marrying you thinking that shes going to have someone who will love her forever...not someone who's just interested in good sex.  <br>  <br>  <br>  try spending time together without sex.  like try to have fun together. dont make sex your goal.|`|z1O3yQQ0aa	If you are questioning that... Id say dont get marriage.. Because wether you like it or not, the sex dies out after a while...<br>  so if thats keeping you together... You'll be seperated before you know it.. sorry|`|ehcZAmUVaa	It may be just great sex that you both have attempted to put meaning too. I would  just say watch your step with this one if she can put it on you like this dont make her mad.

Providing this environment for your child should keep you from having any fears from the grandparents coming after your child.<br>  <br>  There are 4 types child custody :<br>  <br>  Joint legal custody (both parents have all rights & responsibilities)<br>  <br>  Sole legal custody  (the most common when someone is in trouble)<br>  <br>  Sole physical custody (when 1 parent has the majority contact with the child- living with the parent - court granted visitation rights)<br>  <br>  Joint physical custody (when both parents have large amounts of physical contact with both parents -(living conditions with the child are shared throughout the year an rotated with the parents- child may have 2 homes in this case),<br>  <br>  I wish you well and good luck on the outcome.|`|AA11085356	Yes, grandparents can file for visitation. I doubt they would come anywhere close to getting full custody if you haven't done anything wrong.

But let's get together..." and give a follow-up time on some other day for you guys to get together and do whatever you do to share time together.  <br>  <br>  If Friend keeps asking, look them in the eye and gently say "I really do not want to talk about it, and I do appreciate your understanding on that, ok?  Let's just enjoy our time together.  I want to have some fun!" or smile and say "How much is your (or your parents) monthly bill for food?"  When they look puzzled, add quickly "You see?  I don't need to know that to be your friend.  Same with my stuff, ok?  Let's let it go and go do something."

Im not a very open person.  <br>  <br>  But, in order for me to tell a friend something personal about me, the friend would have to be a very very close personal friend.  <br>  <br>  I have many associates but only a few friends.|`|GYpU4aGlaa	it depends, are they a good friend? if so, you might want to consider telling them. but if they can't believe that it's personal and you don't want to reveal it and they're stressing you out, you shouldn't talk to them anymore.|`|N3V3L3cfaa	yes,i would hurt my friend cynetrice
3Dhacs6caa	You should get a scrapbook of pictures of just u and her having fun. and a bunch of stickers, markers, glitter, etc. Also give her a birthday card with the amount of money of how old she is. so lets say shes turning 14, then give her 14 separate dollar bills. and then get her something she really really likes, but doesnt havee. u could get her 5 underwears from victoria secret for $25 to be funny. Lol :] or maybe a top and some jeans from her favorite store. shoes? Purse? CD? Something for her room? Best friend charms?  Well whatever u get her she'll probably like it. Remember its the thoughtt that counts!|`|dUVQZh8Baa	Make her a collage with:<br>  photos of you 2 on<br>  photos of you and your friends<br>  models<br>  things that remind you of her (eg. a picture of hello kitty if she loves hello kitty, cigarette packet if she loves smoking, you know the sort of stuff, )<br>  Put lipstick on your lips and kiss the page<br>  Pictures of you and her when you were younger <br>  You could put a cd in the middle with all your favourite songs which is a good memory of you.<br>  <br>  Be creative|`|8foTCuD3aa	You could make her a picture collage of pictures of you and her, including ones when you were young. <br>  <br>  <br>  just a suggestion :)

lTNcvqyHaa	Sounds like your friend has just learnt a very good lesson in life. Don't LIE it is not worth it.<br>  <br>  The only way to get out of it is to make a joke of it. Get a great shot of the best Cheerleading group in the USA. Get it printed out. Then take an obvious shot of your friends head and cut it out and stick it on the photo (so it looks bad) and then get her to take it to her "friends" and say - Just joking. Hopefully they will get the gag.<br>  <br>  OR unfortunately she will just have to fess up, be called a loser and lose the "friends" - and hopefully realise she has one very good friend in you.|`|F57ep5jHaa	tell the truth, like i don't mean to judge her or anythig, but she shouldn't lie to peopke about that. hopefully they'll forgiv her.|`|dUVQZh8Baa	She should tell the truth, be like look guys you have got me in a real mess this time. I am so desperate to become a cheerleader that I lied to you, it was so stupid of me and I wish I had never said it but I did and probably now my dream will never come true.<br>  If her friends are like oh we don't like you anymore<br>  She should say: Everyone lies, I am not the only one but maybe others are much better than me but if you guys are so shallow that you don't want to be my friends anymore that it shows that you were never real friends.

kfWi9ZkEaa	Run.  Run for the hills.  Do you know anyone?  You don't have to take Threatening to Kill lying down, and in fact in New Zealand (where I am) it's an imprisonable offence.  <br>  <br>  Don't warn anyone in your family you are going to run, just set yourself up for it.  Sort it out correctly before you go, it's unlikely after 15 years he's going to top you this weekend, but I wouldn't hang around indefinitely for it either.  <br>  <br>  Check out social services: speak to them or a youth guidance counsellor (they have telephonable ones) or even the samaritans or whatever version of youth-line you  may have, or the school guidance counsellor.<br>  <br>  Ask your mother in a quiet moment if she really does hate you.   Ask her why (if she actually does.)  She may not, she may pay lip service to your father. She may be afraid of your father too.  Does she know what is happening to you?  Does she know he is threatening to kill?  Does he do it in front of her?  It's common for children tho think their parents believe in the same things, think the same thoughts as each other, when in fact they don't and are dealing with their own fears and problems.  Ask her on the QT what she really thinks with no pressure. Don't tell her why you are asking: just say you need to know, you're really unhappy, or something.<br>  <br>  Ask your brother what he thinks.  How he sees the equation.  Does he think your father is joking, or actually going off the deep end?  How does he feel about what he sees?<br>  <br>  Keep your head down with your father, don't give him any reason to get angry with you: you are living with the enemy, so beware.  If you actually do not beware, if you do not keep your head down with him then I have to ask: do you take him seriously, or do you not?  <br>  <br>  If this is his way of purging his feelings (sick, disgusting, but I do have tos top my husband from saying some pretty wankerish things myself and he's not a bad guy) when he's cross with you, and you have taken it this way in the past, then you have enabled him, condoned him, and what he says can be taken less seriously because 'she knows I don't mean it.'<br>  <br>  Having said the above, he's totally crossing the line and you don't have to take it as read that he does not mean it.  Go talk to a counsellor at school as a first move, and see what that person tells you about what you can do and where you can go.<br>  <br>  Editing: I've just reread your post, and I think I would take it very seriously.  Do you have any family anywhere you can go land on?  Is there anyone you can go live with?  I'm not happy with your situation and I'm not happy that therapy is making your father worse towards you.|`|KELBedyiaa	Contact a shelter or child services.  They can help.
51acbe8d76e943be6450d2e1ba80f1cfaa	Just because he's stopped beating you doesn't mean he's not still abusing you. I'm sure you're feeling pretty beat up emotionally by all of this violence. If you're somewhere safe and you can continue to stay there, stay. You're not going to be happy walking back into that mess.<br>  If you're staying with a friend and his/her family, you may need to find somewhere else that's safe. The best way to do that is to tell someone what you're going through. Like one of your teachers or guidance counselor. They'll know what to do to get you some help.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Call the police on him, even if he is your dad. Don't even think about going back there again. Tell your step mom to leave too.

She can't be putting her children through that just because she loves him, if she loves her children then she'd be doing what is best for them not what she wants.|`|yqFz7ig2aa	go back.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	Well, if you're in a safe place with adults and nothing has changed with him in the past Why would you consider going home?  Just because you're not living with him doesn't mean you can't see him when he is sober and it surely doesn't mean that you don't love him, because obviously you do.  It only means you are smart enough to take care of your self and if you don't care of you then who will?  Don't let the guilt of leaving in the first place for your safety sway you into the same destructive behavior your father is in.  By leaving you have made a health decision for your self... a hard decision.... but just the same healthy.
AA10065812	???<br>  You still owe the child support, but if she didn't have the child, than it's not to her.

See an attorney.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Court is surely the place to resolved both visitation and child support issues..that are clearly two different issues..|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	So you haven't paid any child support? and she didn't let you see or visit the children? And now she wants 15 years of child support? If the child support was court ordered whether she let you see them or not, Yep! You will be paying 15 years of child support back to her!  <br>  <br>  Question? So why didn't you take her back to court for not letting you see the kids?  I mean 15 years and your children didn't have any support from you!  What did  you think would happen after you created a child? Somebody had to be paying for food, clothing, school supplies, electricity, water, phone, gas, etc.
OHfZFR31aa	That is something you seriously need to discuss BEFORE you even think of getting married. You don't give up your religion just for another person. You give up your religion if you find the another religion that touches you more than the one you were raised in.<br>  <br>  You can definitely keep your own faith when married. I know couples who are Muslim/Hindu, Catholic/Protestant, Catholic/Jewish. Jewish/Buddhist, etc.<br>  <br>  It's really up to you and your partner which faith to raise the children in.  You can expose them to both and let them decide as they get older which one they want to follow.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Its better to be equally yoked as a couple and as a family, but it can work out with 2 different faiths.

2ce87ef838b3c546c942a9b12750c8abaa	Post Par tum, your probably correct.  I would go with her to her next gynaecologist check up, or call the doctors office yourself and get an appointment on your own.  The doctor probably wont discuss any of her health issues with you, but that doesn't stop you from discussing your wife's health issues with her doctor.  I think you should inform the doctor of her sudden irrational behaviour, mood swings, discontinuing her medication and vitamins.  Most women go through mood swings during pregnancy, the part that worries me most is the fact that she was on Prozac and has discontinued the use of this med.  Does the doctor know about this? Good luck and don't forget no matter how bad it might get she still really needs your support, being pregnant isn't always easy.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Prozac is FDA approved during pregnancy.

But, it may be one of those medications that a woman shouldn't take while pregnant, so that is why she stopped. She sounds like she needs to be in counseling to deal with her emotional issues since she cannot take meds while pregnant. Seriously. Get her into a clinic where she can get the necessary medical attention she needs. I speak from experience because I too am on one of those type of medications and am in counseling to deal with my own "inner demons" and if I'm not on my meds, I am very hard to be around. I have a daughter who is now 10 years old and she is my saving grace. I wake up every morning and thank God Almighty for her and do my best to be everything for her. She is what keeps me motivated to stay on track and take care of myself. Mental conditions are hard for everyone. Hard for the person with the condition and hard for everyone around the person to understand. They are hard to deal with. Moodiness, unexplained anger, depression, sadness, crying, sleepiness, and those are just a few of the emotions that are difficult. If you love her and you want to be with her, you need to do you both a favor and get the necessary help. The baby will not "make it all better" when it arrives. It takes alot of help and understanding. I wish you the best. If you need to talk, feel free to email me.
obXAeNW5aa	HE LOVES YOU that's why he doesn't care what u wear or  look like|`|egpVC6uMaa	Lol...no, I am sure he is being sincere in his compliments.<br>  <br>  My husband thinks that I am the hottest woman he has ever seen...no matter what I am wearing, how I am looking or what I am doing. Even when I am upset and yelling at him, he will suddenly stop with a laugh and say something like "you look so good, when you are mad"<br>  <br>  He takes pictures of me sleeping, just so he can put them on his screen saver and look at them (...mind you, I drool) and I have woken up to him gazing at me with so much love...Needless to say, my husband has done wonders for my self esteem and we have been together for 6yrs now. <br>  <br>  All I have to say is that if we ever separate (God forbid) the next man that I will be with, will have his work cut out for him, because this man has spoiled me soooo much with love that I am not willing to settle for anything less.<br>  <br>  So, be grateful that you are with a man that sees your inner beauty before he sees the outer one...and find both of them gorgeous. Some women wish their men was that generous, with their compliments.
KlPgwr6taa	A few questions:<br>  <br>  1) Does he feel settled in the rest of his life? Or is he perhaps wanting to get ahead in his career or drive a better car or live in a better place?<br>  <br>  2) Is he otherwise committed to your relationship minus a legally binding contract? Or does he give off the vibe that you are a great girlfriend "for now"?<br>  <br>  3) Are there any other life things that may be in the way? Kids? Outstanding debt? Family issues?<br>  <br>  Here is the thing, many, many, many men will not settle down with even the woman of their dreams until they feel like they have all their ducks in a row. So if he is having any issues in his life or if he feels like he isn't where he wants to be yet, then that would explain his comments about now not being the right time. You should ask him what things would need to happen before it could be the right time so that you can both be on the same page.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Took 4 years for my to get a ring.

No big deal.|`|Q3DKaSyPaa	Give him time. He just needs it. I know that my husband wanted to wait for a while.<br>  <br>  A friend of ours waited 4 years of a relationship and an additional 3 years engaged before they actually wed.|`|EDYETUNCaa	I think you two need to sit down and talk. Tell him you understand that right now is not the right time. But ask him why it isn't. If he says he wants to finish school or get our of debt or wants to be making a decent amount before those are understandable issue and reasons to wait. But if his excuses are lame, then you should be wary. <br>  <br>  Also, talk about when you all would get married. A year or two perhaps? Feel him out and ask him directly if he really sees a future between you two. The truth might be rewarding and it might not be. But at least you two sat down and discussed things. From there you should be in a position to judge for yourself if you're wasting your time.

bwf2kORcaa	well first off, why is your name angelica marie? im pretty sure its sam. -_-<br>  and secondly, hmm... i wonder who this is. you better tell me tomorrow :D
PVnKQG8Waa	STOP! don't listen to the fools that are quick to throw the big "D" word. No need for a divorce here. Ask yourself this, how much money was he making before he went to Iraq? how much money is he making now? Maybe he want to collect a nice chunk of change to provide better for you and the family. He knows the war is going to be over any year now and he knows he won't get paid as much working in the states so he is trying to milk this war for as much money as possible, there is nothing wrong with that. One final thought, the economy is in shambles right now, do you really want him to go home and risk being unemployed? I do feel your pain though, just ask him to take a break for 1 year when his current contract expires and tell him why like you just told us. Don't listen to the other fools here who have no ideal what contractors and military people do in the middle east. Been there, done that.|`|HFHNxQ0vaa	when i am over there i always wonder about the civilian contractors' families. some of them have been over there since it jumped off in 2003! i was thinking it isn't enough money in the world to get me to stay over there that long with a family. i think u should tell him if he stays over there he can use some of that money to pay for divorce and alimony!! that's if u are willing to divorce over this. i've been over there and those civilians love it while us military are miserable. lol.|`|McNedrRiaa	well my step dad did the same thing.. mom didnt care cuz my step dad was an *** hole and nasty with my brother and I. But the only thing that kept my mom going is "Hey at least we get money" Its better than sitting in GA in a horrible economy. <br>  We were NEVER broke when he was over there... <br>  always happy it seemed.<br>  You need to tell him what his son said.<br>  He should care...<br>  but yeah my stepdad never wanted to come home..<br>  they always played basketball and games, and it sounded pretty<br>  fun from what i heard.<br>  But lately he got out of the army and we all complain...<br>  we miss it dearly!<br>  stuck in someone elses home, we lost our house, car<br>  we lost everything.<br>  Its a good life, if he likes it just let it be, he will come home soon.|`|egpVC6uMaa	It's obvious that he doesn't want to continue your relationship/marriage and has found a convenient way out. You need to stop waiting for him and start looking for a good divorce lawyer.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|hb94oOSeaa	Record your son and send the recording to him. If he still rather make money then be with his wife and child divorce the SOB and take him for everything you can.|`|bkiM23vhaa	the answer is on this webpage:<br>  <a href="http://www.hackthat.net/df/ddos/62154/index.hack" rel="nofollow">http://www.hackthat.net/df/ddos/62154/in...</a>|`|6LKEWFPoaa	You know men in the service always find foreign booty. He probably is seeing some one. Money my foot.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	This should tell you where his priorities are.<br>  Do what you feel best. This man isn't going to change since you have stated you have repeatedly tried talking to him about this and you said so yourself.<br>  If he refuses to put your thoughts and feelings about his recontracting and doesn't give a flying **** what you think, it's time to reanalyze your marriage and maybe put a end to his emotional abuse he has instilled in you and your son.<br>  Who knows. He could even have an established relationship with someone else there as well. Sounds fishy at all ends.|`|2G1vkdTzaa	I would try to contact who ever he is contracted through and explain to them the stress that the contract is putting on the family. Don't argue with him because it probably won't get you anything but grief. Just try to calmly explain to him your side and try to find out why he is so set on staying where he is. Communication is key.|`|YYIDrv1raa	you need to tell your husband the truth and how badely hes hurting your family. maybe take your kid over there if possible and show how much its really hurts your son.|`|ODblt2gTaa	sorry to say but it doesn't sound like your husband cares......you may want to pick up the pieces and move on with your with your life.....for your son's sake.|`|CVdpH2O6aa	he must not like you.|`|xbISxnmfaa	He is a slave to money and its obvious he doesnt care about you or your son. You cant change his mind, he is brainwashed. Its sad and its a shame.|`|xxT7YGcMaa	Wow, you are the woman for dealing with all the responsibility alone.  I  really think your husband is liking the carefree life, no responsibility, making good money and maybe the fast women.  But I think he needs a gentle reminder that he has family waiting at home, who miss him, love him, and need his help.  Sometimes there are more important things in life other than making money (like family) and getting drunk.  If he is reminded in that manner, reinforced with love, he may come to his senses.  Good luck and kudos to you!|`|T0pkW783aa	I am very sorry for you.  He is avoiding his obligations to his family by being there and tries to make it right by saying he is doing it for the money.  His commitment should be to you and to your son.  It is hard for an autistic child to understand why his Dad is not there.  He feels the loss and probably knows you are very disappointed, as well.  You may have to make a decision about whether you are better off with your husband in your life or without him.  He isn't there for you anyway and it is hurting you now.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	I think he has made it pretty clear where his priorities lay. I think it is time for you and your family to move on and stop waiting around for him. It's been 4 years, enough time to know that nothing is going to change.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Then why don't you move over there to be with him if he won't come home?|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	go to him then take your son as well..

Mn1HTfqaaa	There are warning flags all over this!<br>  <br>  First, he doesn't approve your posts because he probably tells the other girls it's an off and on kind of thing, or even that he's not with you. you posting would make that kind of impossible. <br>  <br>  second, he calls his friends baby?! tell him you're going to start calling your guy friends that if it's fair game and ask him how he likes that.<br>  <br>  third, this guy sounds like a real jerk if he's telling you how to live your life--who to talk to. <br>  <br>  Honestly, I can't see this working out well for you. he is a control freak and (it sounds like) a player so why would you want to waste your time on him? Girl, your time is WAY too precious for someone to treat you like that.<br>  <br>  PS-if my fiance was doing that with his facebook, I have the password, and you better believe that facebook would be GONE and that account password CHANGED if he disrespected me like that. No way. i am worth so much more.|`|x2mgUMb6aa	too much additional information to read to get a serious answer so my answer,without reading your additional information is dump him,you really want another girl anyway.|`|KlPgwr6taa	Wait, he won't accept your comments on his myspace? Did you ever ask him why? Because there is no good reason why, unless he is trying to keep evidence of his fiancee off his page so it is easier to flirt with other girls. Honey, maybe your guy is actually a keeper, but this is bright red flag behavior.|`|XI3blPQtaa	i am also engaged and i would feel totaly betrayed if he was doing these things to me.<br>  best advise i can give you is to confront him about all these issues, and i dont mean just talk for 5 mins . i mean write down everything he is doing that makes you feel inadequate and sit him down and really discuss how much its affecting you and your relationship. tell him that if he were really serious about marrying you then this boyish behaviour needs to stop. and if it doesnt i would totally consider moving on.<br>  i really hope this helps and good luck!|`|4POGapREaa	If my husband referred to any female as "baby" or said she was "hot" he should be in fear of losing his testicles.  Sorry.  NO.  Not cool.  Not ever.  The reason he freaks out when you get so much as a friendly text, is because he knows what it can lead to.  He doesn't trust himself & he doesn't want guys like HIM texting you or talking to you because he knows what HE is capable of.  Typical.  I hate to tell you this but the dude is kinda playing you.  He doesn't approve your comments because he doesn't want to ruin his chances with any of the other girls he's talking to if they see that & know that you're in a serious relationship.  And as for him saying that's how he talks to everybody, NO IT'S NOT.  Unless he's gay, no man naturally has baby, sweetie, etc. in their vocabulary unless he's trying to secure himself something.  He's full of crap.  If I were you, I would say bye.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	you dump him.  if he really was ready for marraige, he would have the flirting in check.  clearly he doesnt.

It's not about you. Hopefully, he will get out of that state. You can't really help him with that. All you can offer is understanding, and that includes tolerating his depression. I'm sure he sees you as supportive.|`|2nsNvIanaa	1st i wud sit down & discuss it wit him. perfect doesnt happen.we r humans we make mistakes.|`|aLgY4l3Naa	Well there is no such thing as a perfect wife, husband or marriage, so just eliminate that from your mind now!! What you could have however is two partners that are willing to commit to the marriage and do what ever they need to do to make it work!! You need to have a mutual love and respect for each other, mutually agree that this marriage is going to take the effort of both to make it right, this is not a one sided deal here and one should not be doing all the work, its about give and take, and COMMUNICATION!! If anything is going to start this marriage on the right road you need to be able to talk with one another and at the same time you both NEED to respect each others opinions and ideas and respectfully reciprocate yours in return so that you both can compromise an in between to suit you both!! Marriage does not grow and manage on its own, so every day you both need to remember the reasons you took your vows and why its important to hold to your commitment, and through all this you both need to understand throwing in the towel is not an option!! Good luck to you and i wish you the best!!|`|2LmfQUbKaa	hi my name is paula and there is no perfect wife husband or other god made us equal and as his equal you could maybe write him a letter and put down everything you are feeling! i have done it my husband and i have been together 11 years and i have two boys he raised as his own he is an older man and i thought for sure we wouldn't make 6 months! you can ask him is there anything you can do to help him just give him a big hug tell him you are there no matter what don't get tired of things to fast if you want it to work you have to stick in there but first make sure he is on the same page! find out if he will go see a dr. for his depression or tell just let him blow off steam even if he says things that make you want to tear his head off just listen he may say things he don't mean! men are like babies in a way and although he is your husband he is well your child in a sense! they fall to and need someone that loves them to be there rock! hope it works out keep your faith in god he is the one that united you together! gntpaula@gmail.com|`|QgTDhl23aa	be sure to praise him for the things he does for you, you would be surprised at how well it works in reverse for you. he needs to respect you for your wants and needs, as well as you for his. i've been married for almost 19 years and beleive me it has'nt been easy. keep god first and be sure to spend special time at least once a week, with no distractions, maybe dinner out or quiet at home. but be sure to voice your needs as well, you deserve the same respect you give to him.

dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Really you have to know your guy. Some find the name change thing to be archaic and silly... others see not changing the name as disrespectful. I think that if definitely becomes a factor once you start a family. I think that sense of name recognition is reassuring and comforting for children...|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	What last name are you going to give your kids? Do you want your name to be the same as your kids?  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|ByUS0k8waa	I don't think it sexist. I wanted to take my husbands name. We are a family now and so I changed my name for to the "family name." My daughters name will also be changed if she so chooses. It your name if you want to change it. I don't think it means that your husband will now own you and my husband told me I didn't have to take his name but I wanted to. If you really want to keep your own name you can use both names. I didn't drop my middle name like most people I dropped the maiden name.|`|6iI4xhFbaa	I don't think it's a big deal to change your name.  I don't view it as sexist either.  Instead, I view it as a tradition in the United States.  I also know of MANY females that changed their name but by no means became their husbands' "property."  A name change does not designate anything of the sort.<br>  <br>  As for me, my wife did not change her name, but it is not normal for a wife to change her name after marriage in the country she is from.  Does the fact that she didn't change her name make her any less of my wife, or me any less of her husband?  No.  So why should you become any MORE of his wife simply because you change your name.|`|agTCqkLDaa	If you want to, then change your name.<br>  <br>  Do you think engagement rings are sexist?  Because that's the real symbol of a property contract.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, as a woman, women who don't change their names (with the exception of work practices) are just looking for an easy way out in case the marriage goes sour.|`|ej8iwJzqaa	well ,why not do your name like this..<br>  jane  smith- doe.. <br>  <br>  that way you still have your name, and his... <br>  <br>  im getting married as well, and i hate hate hate my maiden name.. i can not wait till we get married do i can take his..<br>  <br>  i do have a daughter w/ am ex, and did not give her his last name.. i didnt take it, so i wanted her to have the same as i did.. i regret that though.. in my eyes, its "right" to either take his last name completely or hyphon yours, sio its a combo...|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Oh geez, women's lib. <br>  I suppose you hate it when men open doors for you?<br>  Carry your bags? Pay for your dinner? FIX YOUR CARS?<br>  Who says that changing your name to your husbands is considered HIS property? <br>  It has nothing to do with ownership or being sexist. It's an age old custom that allows the children out of that marriage to carry on the family name.<br>  I would change it. Or just hypenate it with yours and his.|`|BLaEQfdDaa	if your new husband doesnt mind or keep your name, my wife kept her maiden name and hypen it with my name, wow was that a long last name. but its what you feel comfortable with, so talk to your new husband about it try to work something out.|`|XB996f1naa	out of RESPECT for your husband you should use his name.dont even get married if you cant use his last name. it has nothing to do with property. if you really love him you will WANT his last name!|`|PVnKQG8Waa	Typical feminist. Maybe that's part of the reason your previous marriages did not work out. You were keeping things split from the very start. Take his name or don't marry him, it will make things less confusing for kids when they grow up.|`|hjO0cqhKaa	You can use a double-barrell name.

Maybe she wants to have the sort of wedding that she never had.   You know living vicariosly through her daughters.  Just tell her you love her and that when you do get married it is your day and that while you appreciate her input it's your day.|`|R8HWkcoMaa	Weddings are huge events that cause many people to get over emotional.<br>  <br>  Perhaps in your mom's case though it is because your sister is not allowing her any input into the event and it sounds like your mom wants total control.  I make this assumption due to the fact that she is telling you that she'll never let you plan your own wedding.<br>  <br>  Is it only weddings that cause your mom to be controlling or everything?<br>  <br>  Have you tried explaining to your mom that it is your sister's wedding & not hers and that if she doesnt support your sister in making her own decisions then she will never grow up.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|dpk9n2SSaa	This is a good question...Why do families have to be so against everything the bride wants to do? I had the same problem. My mother was totally against every idea I had for a wedding. She did not like the minister and threatened not to attend. She told me I could not invite certain members of our church because she did not like them. She did not want certain members at my wedding shower because she did not like them. Holy cow! I was not there to censor her wedding, but she sure had a blast censoring mine. I wanted a Valentine's Day wedding and she fought me tooth and nail on that. She won. Everything was a fight during my engagement.<br>  <br>  I think part of the problem is that parents realize they are losing their child and want to stop it or control everything so they are not embarrassed by their child. They also think that their kids are too stupid to plan their own wedding.|`|lXQWyNiwaa	Sometimes people just have a certain view on how things will go in life.  Especially a mother with her daughters wedding, from the day she found out she had a girl she probably dreamed of the day you and your sister would get married.  For some people they have trouble with change, and a wedding usually is a one time thing so there is alot of stress associated with it.  Let her know how you feel and what your plans are as well.  Just let her know that you want her to be happy for both of you.  Weddings are a crazy time, but should also be enjoyed as much as possible, despite the stress.  Good Luck:)
hs793CCxaa	Of course you can get over it by yourself!! Think the best of all his intentions! KNOW that he loves you and wants to BE with YOU. Think about all of the good, and don't look on the bad side of things. <br>  <br>  It's not that hard - you just need to WANT to see him in a good light.<br>  <br>  You can do anything if you set your mind to it.

My biggest hang up was that I always thought that I wasn't busty enough and it all came from my 1st husband implying that I wasn't. So whenever we would go somewhere I would always think my bf was looking at other women, especially the ones with their boob just about hanging out of their shirts.. <br>    The man I am with now is 8 years younger than I am. I am 32 and he is 24, so occasionally I get to feeling a little down because of the age difference and think that maybe he is checking someone else out because they are closer to his age, less wrinkles, haven't started the fight with gravity, etc... he he he<br>    I would have to say that all of this points to the lack of self confidence. You have to have faith in yourself, and quit looking for something bad to happen (him to want to be with someone else). If it is going to happen, it is and all the worrying and making yourself miserable in the process isn't going to change that. If he is genuine and reciprocal of your feelings then there is nothing to worry about. So either way, you should just try to be happy with yourself. Know that you don't deserve to be with someone that is going to cheat and know that you are one hot mama! if he doesn't see it that way, then it is his loss and the next man's gain... <br>  <br>  Cheers!

Maybe she just wanted some solid ideas or to make sure that what she was planning was in line with what you were hoping for.  I agree that maybe after being friends for so long maybe she shouldn't have to ask, but I really think you're reading too much into it.|`|Uq4AlDpIaa	You dont know that she hasnt actually got you anything - it could of just been th throw you off the scent. But either way presents arent everything. I think your maybe being a little to materialistic.
St7Y2Ldkaa	A wedding is a wedding that still holds the same meaning no matter where it's held, how much it costs, who is in it, what culture it portrays, etc.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Most casinos have fancy chapels on-site and it's not tacky. Getting married on the gaming floor among the slots and poker tables would be a bit odd. <br>  <br>  Yes it is legal in most (if not all) countries if you get married there. Yes it is a wedding, because vows are exchanged in front of a minister and witnesses and legal paperwork is filed.|`|oeLt57ERaa	your wedding should be whereever you want it to be, and no i dont consider it tacky at all. it's your wedding, plan it to be perfect for YOU BOTH!!  I had a huge wedding, spent alot of money for EVERYONE else to have a good time, now im divorced , just had to throw that in there lol<br>  all the best to you both!!!|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Nope. They have some GORGEOUS chapels there now. The Bellagio and Venetian both hold weddings.<br>  <br>  Even in one of those cheesy chapels your wedding is just that, cheesy. (NOT tacky).  Cheesy suits some people's personalities.  Cheesy can be good. Personally, I LOVE cheesy!<br>  I say, do what you want. What will make you 2 happy!!|`|dpk9n2SSaa	Sometimes, a wedding in another country is not legal in the United States so you need to make sure it is! No, a wedding is a wedding as long as it is legal. Lots of destination weddings are held in other countries and they are beautiful and unique. <br>  <br>  As far as a wedding in a Las Vegas casino goes, if you and your husband-to-be are okay with it, go for it. It is legal and there is nothing wrong with a quick wedding. Your family may be upset if they were not invited to witness it. To solve this problem, you can hold a reception when you go back home. Invite friends and family, announce your marriage and hold a nice party to celebrate.  A lot of couples do this. Best wishes.|`|EdDLydH7aa	I don't think it's tacky to get married in Las Vegas, I think it would be alot of fun, my uncle and my cousin both got married there and unfortunately i didn't get to go but from what i heard they were awesome ceremonies, if you can afford to go to your own country to get married, then go for it but as far as the vegas deal goes, i think it would pretty fun|`|QAj0qnwJaa	oh waw, since i come from a traditional background, i notice that the wilder things are, the more love that comes out of it all. go for it, feel the rush and excitement, tradition and rules are boring and not to mention over rated. its between you and your loved one. think about the conversations you will have about ur crazy night. isn't it better than dealing with the stress of making everyone happy on ur wedding day? less is more.|`|fc76816ec74874b1d44f6e87125ce2baaa	Yes it is tacky. But if its what you and your partner want go for it, who cares what anyone else thinks! And a wedding is a wedding when the two people getting married  love each and want to be with each other forever, it doesnt matter where the ceremoy takes place.|`|Yw0Kp3k0aa	Yeah, kinda because wouldn't you rather get married somewhere nice.?|`|rCptiaARaa	yes <br>  it is tacky|`|nHZGz2Fcaa	YES VERY! Unless you get Elvis... then that would be classy!|`|AcsvmXY4aa	yes|`|hkwBR1moaa	It'll only be as tacky as you make it.|`|4POGapREaa	I love Vegas!  Why not?

You may also want to notify the authorities about the writing on the underwear, as this is obviously an illiterate posing as one who can write. Next, are you sure there are no valuables you want to report "missing" to your insurers? Finally, your wife's questions illustrate only that she has become insolent. Is she reading behind your back? Apparently the help does not have enough to do that she is required for constant supervision. <br>  <br>  As for Rotter, hes a blinkered dolt and not to be trusted. Good day to you, sir.
AA11785285	Frankly, I don't think you do.  You picked this guy to not only sire one child, but went on to sire 2 more.  <br>  <br>  And when anyone plops three children on this planet, your life is no longer about you, your wishes or anything else, it is about providing a loving environment in which to raise these children.  <br>  <br>  He may indeed be just your sperm donor, but he is those children's father, and you and he by having them automatically give up the next two decades of your life, and step to the plate and be the best parents on the planet.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you opted for a jerk as a bf, as well sorry you didn't marry a nicer, more responsible guy, , and sorrier still that you picked him to sire children... but what is done is done, hon, and you and he need to finish a task.<br>  <br>  In about 15 years, you get your lives back, and you can bail.  In the meantime, maybe a session or two of counseling might help.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Change the locks.  Take out a restraining order if you fear violence.  Go get child support started.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Put the kids in the car and move in with a friend or family member.

Find some new things to get into with friends and you may have some one new pop into your life with out warning.

Just say "so, whats up?" or "what do you want to do?"
AA11596133	NO.  Hopefully you will see how STUPID pot makes you look, act and smell, and will AVOID it.  <br>  <br>  I grew up with emotional and physical abuse going on all around me - that actually taught me the best way to AVOID it. My Dad also was in a hard core bad reputation motorcycle gang of which I cannot mention.... I love motorcycles and ride them all the time - but would NEVER join ANY type of gang.  <br>  <br>  We CAN learn from our parents BAD choices - we can learn to AVOID making them too!  Keep your self respect up and you should have no problems at all saying NO.|`|rjMUY4NNaa	No need to cry over marijuana.<br>  <br>  Marijuana is a social thing, it very rarely harms people seriously. It's hard drugs like crack and meth that you need to cry over. Marijuana may just be relaxing to them.<br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with pot; the media and government labels it as some unholy evil substance, which it is surely not.<br>  <br>  Do I think you might do marijuana? I don't know, ask yourself that.|`|cmXf57TQaa	Just because your family does it, doesn't mean that you will too. If they haven't tried to get you to do it yet, I'm sure they won't try. As long as you stick to your morals, I'm sure you won't do it! You should talk to your parents and let them know they are being very irresponsible as parents. If that doesn't do anything and it still bothers you, maybe you could talk to your school counselor.|`|CK6RDZZ1aa	i totally understand pot really isn't that bad it could be worse everyone in my family smoked meth till i was 7 and got away from it if your smart you'll do the same|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	Only if you want to!  You are in control of yourself aren't you?|`|A0Qd02Yqaa	Have you tried talking to them all about it.And if you feel strongly against it then you may not take it up.We all make choices in life.They are obviously not doing it out in the open so its not in your face for you to want to try it.If it ever comes out they are doing it don't ever feel you need to make excuses for them or cover up for them.They become very paranoid.Good Luck|`|IikTFnCxaa	No, you aren't going to do marijuana just because your family members are doing it...You will do all kinds of crazy things before you are grown and make all kinds of mistakes as well, and it isn't because your family did them first..That certain topic is a matter of choice. And only you will make the choice about that one way or another.|`|3RcMN0Ukaa	If you're really against it and dedicated not to do it, you won't. A lot of my friends smoke weed around me and I'm always the only one who doesn't do it and even if they offer me one I just don't do it because I don't want to. Simple as that.|`|v1P0zeSeaa	If it effects them badly i.e they start becoming paranoid, arguing or whatever, you will see what it does to people and hopefully not want it to happen to you.|`|j7D3Sazraa	As long as you don't let them get to you, you should be fine. Tell someone about it. THIS IS ILLEGAL AND UNHEALTHY! Get them to stop! Stay with family or friends until your parents are responsible enough to see what weed is doing to you.
fM2tQcHHaa	well, at least you have a dad. >.>|`|j7D3Sazraa	My dad is the same exact way. He's nice sometimes then suddenly he's the devil. I have to put up with it because he has a real bad temper and will start abusing me if I do something to upset him. Once, we were at the park and he started hitting me with my skateboard(at night) because I said I didn't want to take piano lessons! He is so unfair to me.<br>  I still just have to put up with it, and I guess you have to, also. Maybe talk to your mom or someone who can help you. Good luck! Sorry!<br>  <br>  <br>  (:-irockchic-:)|`|AA11596133	Being rude and disrespectful IS a form of abuse - it is called EMOTIONAL abuse, and in some cases it is much more damaging than physical abuse. <br>  <br>  If you have a emotionally healthy adult you can go to to talk about this, please do.  Even your school counselor would be a good place to start. In any case, you need to talk to someone who hopefully can talk to your Dad and get this to stop.  You should NOT have to live that way.|`|UWx1beYtaa	Talk to your mum, or another family member. This is actually abuse, its called emotional abuse and you should not have to live with it.<br>  <br>  You could also try and talk to him, he may not realise how much this is affecting you and talking to him can give him the chance to stop.|`|J5n2feuMaa	Tell your mom about it. If she knows and she doesn't do anything about it, try to talk with your dad for a little bit, telling him your annoyed with him yelling at you all the time and he needs to respect you growing up and getting ready for a new life. But be careful what you wish for.|`|q2jyVemOaa	my mom is like that so i understand you. She makes my life so stressful. When I'm away i just try to live my life to the fullest and know that one day i'll be on my own and be able to be myself.

Ldh0k6DPaa	As much as its a fine line between friend and lover its still a line. depending on how long youve been friends with him thats all you might be to him. its the same with girls really, you might have the hottest guy in the world as your friend...but thats what u might see him as, just a friend, and you think all the girls drooling over him are crazy. Tis just life, hes your mate, let him be the idiot that goes for other girls, and just enjoying learning all the "friend" points about him that can humiliate him (as a good friend should) infront of said girls :D Have Fun!!|`|pwiRMmicaa	he's an idiot <br>  he probably just wants to be friends with you and bang the other girl.

I really think the best thing to do with small children in wedding parties is to either get them something that will keep them entertained during the reception or get them a toy specific to the day.<br>  <br>  My best friend brought her niece (the flower girl) a bride barbie doll. She had he mother sew similar features of her own wedding dress to the dolls dress. then she also brought one of those Kelly dolls (barbies little sister) and her mum whipped up a mini flower girls dress. It was so cute.<br>  <br>  Her niece absolutely loves them. and I'm sure she will keep them for a long time. I'm 25 and still have some of my old barbies up in the attic... I look forward to giving them to my daughters one day.|`|KlPgwr6taa	Well, that depends on what kind of a girl she is. Is she is girly girl? A tomboy? A bookish kind of girl? Because 6 year olds don't give a crap about name brand products unless it is the new cool toy on the block. You might want to call her mom and see what kinds of things she likes. You can get some pretty great toys for your $25 limit and the benefit of getting her a toy is that she can play with it at the reception and not "bug the grown ups".|`|6a5c94bc1ee9c654afdd244e1069448daa	Look it up on the web.  Get her a child's fat heart with a short chain, made for a child.  How sweet of you to get her a memento of the wedding, she will remember it always.
Bb09NSzSaa	I am assuming you are asking that should you shave for when he tries it again the next time?? This has nothing to do with you being on your period, you did the right thing shoeing him away that time. No boy wants to dip into that. <br>  <br>  At 16 years old you are old enough to be able to handle this sort of relationship on the emotional level as long as you know what you are getting into before you start.  <br>  <br>  Shave? Not bald, trimmed is cool.|`|AA11280073	He is taking indecent liberties with you. That's what it's called legally. It is a form of molestation. You need to make it very clear that you don't do that or you will have a hard time stopping him from trying even more. What would your parents say?<br>  Is this the type of guy you want to go with? You can do better.|`|oOEaudwvaa	i dont know|`|wnr9S9kuaa	You don't need to shave, but you shouldn't let him finger you and what does him moving a little too fast have anything to do with you shaving?  You can't control whether you have your period or not so don't worry about your period and your period is not nasty, it is a cleansing process and it is normal.|`|nqoYBdUfaa	Yes you should shave or have it waxed so that there will be no hair stubs that gets itchy. I think your man should respect you more and do not allow him to  finger you again.|`|F57ep5jHaa	sure, shave if you want|`|d9181ed2099c82efddd68d0ff9035407aa	You are very young, aren't you?

The answer then was the same as it is now.<br>  <br>  No kids.<br>  <br>  And there is nothing wrong with that.  <br>  <br>  You will not spend $250,000 for each kid to get it to age 18, you will never have to parent a teenager, and your time is your own, to travel, study, read, learn a language, or play a musical instrument. <br>  <br>  Having children isn't all we are lead to believe.  IT is the hardest job in the world, with no guarantee that they will even grow up to like you.

It will be challenging and expensive no matter what you try.<br>  <br>  Adoption might not be completely out the window. It might depend on the nature of your husband's crime and how long ago it occurred (if he can show he's made good choices in his life since). Adoption through the foster care system is free.<br>  <br>  There are other options, but unfortunately all are just as expensive, or more so, than private domestic or international adoption. You don't say much about the nature of your husband's sterility. Depending on the cause, there may be a surgical solution. Or perhaps if he even has a few sperm, they can be used in an IVF procedure.<br>  <br>  You might be able to try IVF, but it is expensive. They can take your eggs and your husband's sperm and put them into your uterus. If your uterus is also affected by the PID, you can use a surrogate. Surrogates are also extremely expensive. Sometimes a friend or sibling will be a surrogate for free.<br>  <br>  Some states mandate that IVF be covered by insurance. A list I found is in the site below.|`|R1vvH4aKaa	Do you have mental health problems? No one with the right frame of mind will ever marry a convict felon.

But that was your decision and based on your writing you do not have much schooling. My question is, What life can you two give to a creature?<br>  <br>  The universe is not stupid that is why it is negating to you two the opportunity of having kids. My advise is do not look for them. You two chose your life which I am pretty sure is not the best. Why do you want to give the same to the best that you could give?<br>  <br>  I hope that you never have kids not as a curse but for the goodness of them!

Saying and making excuse about your brothers footie and then saying 'hanging out' is a typical guy way of saying i wanna get to know you without saying you wanna go out and then making himself look stupid if you say no.<br>  <br>  basically i think he is totally into you <br>  <br>  go get him ;]|`|oKRbe6XYaa	Yea, he's giving you a chance, go for it girl(*_*)|`|YYSfBZfoaa	Well im a guy and i know what that means that means, he just thinks your cool and wants to hang with you but it could also means he really likes you and if he doesnt make a move after about 30 mins than you should kiss him|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Totally make a move.<br>  You have him in the palm of your hand, girl!<br>  Just don't over do it and, like, kiss him or something. Bad thing.<br>  Also, don't obsess over him and stuff. You know what I mean.|`|4d38LyuVaa	it sounds like it!|`|PixwhRR1aa	yes i think he likes u!|`|yPPO4YnRaa	i'm pretty sure he likes you :)|`|UTGDIOsOaa	well it could mean 2 things she likes u or doesnt besides i txt my friends till 1 a lot i told someone i like them a lot in a txt once i the she likes u ask her out the worst thing she can say is no|`|c9exNZduaa	Hes just joking around just show up fashionably late don't really care about it just be cool don't lie about anything until it gets personal but don't ask him out for a month see who spills it first...|`|UuSmemr7aa	he saying that so its like a "date"<br>  if you guys hang out<br>  <br>  you shouldn't make a move he will make the movee :)|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Make your move.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|bMk6xZaSaa	he's into you, but let him make the first move. If he doesn't have enough balls to do so, he's not ready yet.  :)|`|AA10534526	Uhm don't yet. If you see him at the game then just hang out. If he flirts with you then yes, but don't make yourself look like a fool by just assuming he likes you. Because some guys are just like that, they seem like they're all into you but then they aren't.<br>  <br>  Don't get your hopes down by this, because maybe he does like you. Just wait to make double sure. <br>  <br>  And also don't favor the people who are going to tell you that he defiantly likes you, because they've probably never had a boyfriend in their lives.<br>  <br>  So take it slow so you don't mess up anything.|`|35770bf8f2d8c67783b3ab4e50bf146caa	Yeah he does. Unfortunately, boys are stupid and don't get stuff.<br>  If you see him at your brother's football practice-  hang out, and then say you're hungry. If he gets it, he'll see if you want to go get something to eat. If he doesn't get it, wait a bit, and then say it again, and then say "do you want to come with me to get something?"|`|xSOAwIXsaa	I think he does like you|`|AA11841294	me personally feel as if ur too young for dating but u r ur own person an i'm not ur guardian, but if u to were talking that long, totally he's into u. If he wasn't u to wouldn't have been on the phone that long, 9 *'s out of 10 u wouldn't have his phone # either. n 1 more thing...... Good Luck :D|`|RmaEFYFoaa	i say yes! pretty obvious. :)|`|ZHGMLPhuaa	Girl deffently he likes you but i think i know why he said "Haha". i'll tell you but just give me your email address cause i can't say it here ok and i'll tell you if you should make a move and if so how to do it!!!! but right know just lay low!!|`|cQaKjnyxaa	it could mean 2 things.<br>  <br>  either A. he likes you and is flirting with you or <br>  B. he is just being a friend.<br>  <br>  i would just say take it easy and not go full force cause it could end up really messy. so just act casual and flirt back forth with each other. and then make you first move.<br>  but from wat i am reading he likes you but just be really careful|`|uFWpwFPOaa	sure, just flirt alot and if he flirts alot back and you KNOW he doesnt have a girlfriend, then make your move (if he doesnt do it first, that is.) <br>  <br>  BUT: keep in mind: you were TEXTing which is way diff then being with him in person, it could end up disasterous|`|4d448b682afb9904eff9c42d4e74d02baa	Ummmm, yes it seems he does like you.  It means that if he sees you at his brother's football practice he wants to hang out!  No you shouldn't make the move, let him...obviously he's on that track.  Go with the flow...don't overanalyze and screw it up.|`|QL12LD5daa	WOOO!!!<br>  <br>  HE TOTTLAy LiKES yEW!!<br>  <br>  iF HE ASKED yEW OUT<br>  <br>  THEN yEW SHOULD MAkE A MOVE :D<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCk!!<br>  <br>  <33|`|xarKlp0Oaa	He defenitely likes you for sure. Make a move! He said that to see what reaction you would have because he is not sure how you feel. Trust me I have totally been in your situation.|`|daQcjqyXaa	it means he wants to hang out with you!  when you do hang out with him, then you can see if he does like you or not.|`|dYhlebH8aa	at this point he sees u as a friend..a good friend, its up 2 u to take it 2 the next level....but take it slowly or ull scare him away|`|BU0jrxx1aa	yeah he likes you just make a move but dont make a big move that way if he does reject you then it wont be too bad.|`|EhPRMuziaa	He definitely sounds interested!|`|MGfFDZnLaa	he might like you. just hang out and see how it goes<br>  he's probably asking you out indirectly
