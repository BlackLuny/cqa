I don't think you would get double the speed, but as long as you're using two different applications you should be able to benefit from the multiple connections.

xxoX7DJVaa	strcat is definitely a possibility, but it could also be the read from cin to filepath. That's because both filepath and final are pointers but have no memory assigned to them. Therefore you would be writing to an invalid memory location causing a segmentation violation. The fix is to either assign memory to them compile-time by declaring them as arrays (of _MAX_PATH size) or dynamically at run-time by using malloc, calloc or new. The easiest is the former (arrays) as in the latter you would need to free or delete the data depending on which allocator you use once you are done.

This just goes towards proof of what most people in IT know: Most people start at Google for everything.

scLagxRwaa	Answer to one: The server that you keep coming out of in Germany has  high bandwidth. You will see that as you make more requests you'll be switching IP's, but the IP address isn't changed every single time that you make an outside request. The inside mesh may change often but the exit node may update infrequently.<br>  <br>  Answer to two: You can "Use a new identity" under Vidalia, but generally you can't manually change servers.<br>  <br>  Answer to three: I applaud you for noting that the endpoints can be snooped. Generally to prevent eavesdropping you use the "high security" version of whatever site you're browsing which will be an address with https:// instead of http://. This uses SSL encryption to protect data. Understand, however that many times you log into an account it'll switch to https:// for the authentication and then switch back to plain old http:// to view the data. This means that snoopers on your email account may not be able to see your password, but they can see everything else after that. Normally you don't want to use TOR in environments where security is a necessity.

T17pbHVJaa	No, you can't use a password to protect files and folders in Windows. <br>  <br>  There are other ways to protect your files and folders in Windows. You can encrypt your files, manually specify who can access the folders or files, or hide them. (Right click on folder - go to properities, security for some options). Choose your method based on how secure the folders or files need to be. Encrypting is the most secure, while hiding the folders is the least secure.<br>  <br>  Another common way is to compress the folder or files using a ZIP program. Most zip programs like winzip and many others, allow you to password protect that zip file. So you just need to uncompress and then compress with the password when you use those files.|`|8O3ZdHuTaa	Not that I know of without getting more software...

isadV8SHaa	If it is a yellow smiley, then the torrent is still working, it's just telling you that it "could be better". <br>  <br>  You need to open up your firewall software and add the Vuze program into the "trusted applications" section.  Doing this will allow Vuze to open a port to itself through the firewall<br>  <br>  How to do this will depend on the firewall you are using.  If you are using Windows firewall on Windows XP, go to Start> ControlPanel> Windows Firewall>  click the Exceptions tab> click ADD.<br>  <br>  On the "Add a Program" screen you will scroll to either Azureus, or Vuze, (depending on if they've changed the name recently), and if it is not in the list, browse to it in the Program Files folder (mine is C:\ Program Files\ Azureus\ Azureus.exe).  Once you have found the right one, click ok, and ok.<br>  <br>  Now you should restart Vuze.  If your internet router supports UPnP passthrough (all modern ones do), then you shouldn't have to do anything else.  If it doesn't, then you may have to go into your router and statically assign a port to your computer for Vuze to use.  This may be the case if you don't have any green smileys in about 10 minutes on some well-seeded torrents.<br>  <br>  If you end up having to do this port forwarding step, you want to forward  port 18320 (the default port for Vuze if I remember correctly) using both TCP and UDP to the IP address of your computer.  How to do this depends on the router.<br>  <br>  And by the way, changing Vuze from the default port was a clever trick 10 years ago, but it doesn't fool any ISPs these days.  They see your torrents and what-not by statistical analysis instead of relying on services to be tagged to specific ports.<br>  <br>  Additional info:<br>  new edit:<br>  In Vista, after you get to control panel, click "Calssic View" in the left column, then double click the "windows firewall" icon>  click "change settings"> click the Exceptions tab> continue on from above instructions at this point, it is the same.<br>  <br>  Remember, this is only valid if you are using the Windows Firewall.  If you are using Kaspersky, or McAfee, or other antivirus suites, many of them come with a firewall that replaces the Windows one.<br>  <br>  If this is your Belkin router:<br>  <a href="http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Product_Id=136493" rel="nofollow">http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPa...</a><br>  Then it does support UPnP passthrough, so you don't have to mess with port forwarding.|`|1qRMHAjQaa	Set the port in options|`|AA10394789	The NAT problem will not affect the quality of the torrent you are downloading.  It will cause you to have lower download speed than if your NAT was cleared.<br>  The NAT is about your Vuze port having a clear network connection to receive incoming communications.  To do this, the Vuze port needs to be forwarded through any router or firewall that you have.<br>  <br>  I believe this is the guide for your Belkin (this was the part number I found at the Belkin site for the 54g)<br>  <a href="http://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Belkin/F5D7230-4/Azureus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.portforward.com/english/route...</a><br>  <br>  You would also need to set an exception in your software firewall for Vuze.

KTz3qpCvaa	I have used both and can tell you honestly that Ubuntu has a slightly better feel to it. By default you are right Kubuntu looks really nice, but with Compiz Fusion and Emerald Ubuntu can look just as nice if not better.<br>  <br>  Ubuntu simply comes with better software than Kubuntu, but both can be setup to run the same things. Oh and just to let you know Ubuntu/Kubuntu can be setup to run both GNOME and KDE.|`|hGG7cbiTaa	there both the same really The difference is only in which window manager is installed 1 (kubuntu) uses kde(by defualt added coz the answer below) and ubuntu uses gnome (by defualt added coz the answer below)  so its just what ever u like the look off and feel of best i prefer gnome (ubuntu) but thats my personal prefreance i do find it easier to use they offer a live cd download and burn um both try um both for few hours see which you like the look and feel of more.<br>  <br>  they both recive the same updates , the same packages work etc so just what u like the look of best it really is personal choice like iv said i love ubuntu tho i know people prefer kubuntu depends aswell on what you intend to do since both distro's do come with diffrent packages installed first of all

I got on his account and messaged some of the girls to let them know he is married and has been for 4 years and I then changed his status back to married and in his something about me spot I wrote I am a happily married 26 year old man who enjoys spending time with my wife and family and working on my car. I don't think he has even found out about that yet, lol! Let him go if he is such an asshole and you know you can't work it out but don't make it easy for him. Go and talk to all the females in his life and tell them exactly what he is, if he can do it to you he will do it to someone else!

gWlmU1KJaa	its not frostwire itsself you need to worry about, that in itself is clean<br>  <br>  <br>  but, with so many fake and virus files it finds and offers you to download thats a minefield i suggest you dont walk into|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Frostwire is just a filesharing program.<br>  <br>  Are knives safe? Well, they are if you don't use them to cut yourself (try cutting vegetables instead of your finger).<br>  <br>  Frostwire, like Limewire or BitTorrent, is just a tool for looking at what other files people are sharing and then downloading those files while sharing the files with still others.<br>  <br>  As long as you're downloading legally shareable content, you should be fine (don't pirate or illegally download stuff).<br>  <br>  To be safe, though, you should use a limited user account in Windows. Do not run as administrator.|`|HOq5Urn1aa	Frostwire is completely safe, does not have viruses, does not mess up your computer and is legal.<br>  The only way frostwire is becoming dangerous is in the hands of some one who does not know how to handle it.<br>  Same with a care, car is not dangerous, but a person driving the care without any driving experience can make the care dangerous.<br>  Same with frostwire. There are always a lot of fake files when you do a search and when you download these your computer will get infected. Stay away from those fake files.<br>  The small files you see are much too small to be a song, so it is therefore very likely, that those small files are the fake files<br>  Start downloading files 2500/3000kb, have your anti virus up to date, so that when a virus might slip through it will take care of it.<br>  So in short. when you stick to the rules of downloading the right files, frostwire is safe to use.|`|o9Xq0rOlaa	Theres no difference between Limewire and Frostwire they both do the same thing, just make sure your antivirus and antispyware are up to date,the reviews for the new Limewire are horrible i wouldnt touch it.,just read through a few of the reviews.

zorYTX59aa	Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their <br>  servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck<br>  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer<br>  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time. <br>  That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios: <br>  bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish<br>  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the<br>  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few <br>  hours or by the next day.<br>  <br>  If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,<br>  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to<br>  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result <br>  being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to <br>  a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way; <br>  or C) never even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history". It is best<br>  if you shutdown and reboot afterwards. You'll be amazed at <br>  how "fresh" and "new" your YouTube will be.<br>  <br>  Note 1: a strange fix that once worked for me was changing<br>  the website URL from "www.youtube.com" to "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 2: nothing about playing YouTube videos has changed <br>  in the past 2 years. If anything, the newer Flash players are <br>  causing many YouTubers a whole lot of grief, especially the<br>  5 versions of Flash 10. It is absolutely farcical that there's a<br>  10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. Updates <br>  are typically good for one thing: software/computer conflicts.<br>  I've never strayed away from 9.47, and many flashers swear<br>  by 9.45. Think of them as XP compared to Vista.

Once you download the ZIP folder, right click on it and select the option "extract all". Once everything is extracted, create a new folder in "Program Files" (Start, My Computer, C:). That will make it easier to find the fonts when installing them. Now just copy the extracted folder from wherever you had it and paste it in the folder you just created.<br>  <br>  Once you've done that, go to Start, Control Panel, Fonts. Click File, Install new font. Then when the search thingy opens, just click the folder where you previously saved the fonts. (Program Files, Fonts). Then just open the folder of the fonts and select the files. (The file is named: TrueType Font File. That will help you find it). Then just click install and you're done.<br>  <br>  To be able to do all this, make sure you have all the privileges of an administrator in your computer, or it will tell you to log on as one.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now that you've installed the fonts, just open Sony Vegas, click Add text media and the font will automatically appear there, with the other ones that came with your computer.<br>   <br>  <br>  Hope I explained everything in an easy way.<br>  Good luck!<br>  ;-)

idfi0lbzaa	Adobe Dreamweaver, Adobe Go Live!, and Microsoft Frontpage are all just editors to assist you with formatting, but they can be limiting.  All you need to make a website is Notepad, or a specialized coding text editor like Notepad++ (<a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/s...</a> and a browser to view your results in.  It's no different that switching between views within Dreamweaver.<br>  <br>  I like to use the STAIR method:<br>  <br>  S - State the problem.<br>  T - Define your tools.<br>  A - Create an algorithm<br>  I - Implement<br>  R - Revise<br>  <br>  S - The problem: the problem is not the software, its the website.  You need to make a website.<br>  <br>  T - What tools are you going to use: an editor (it could be Dreamweaver, Notepad, or Notepad++), and a browser to view it in.  If its going online, you'll need a domain, a host, an FTP program, etc.<br>  <br>  A - Algorithm (how you will do it):<br>  <br>  1. First draw on a piece of paper what you want your website to look like. Make layout sections which will later become div's and give them names, heights, and widths.<br>  <br>  2. Second, create two files in your editor.  One for displaying the structure and content (the HTML file - PHP running linux and SQL), and the second for controlling how that content is displayed (an external CSS file).  Save one as .HTML or .PHP, whichever it is, and the other as .CSS.<br>  <br>  3. In the structure and content file, add a line in between the <head> tags that calls the external style sheet, or CSS sheet.<br>  <br>  4. In the structure and content file, in between the <html><body> tags, add <div> tags and assign them identifiers based on the names you wrote on your piece of paper like this <div id="name">.  The content of the div goes between the tags, which end with </div><br>  <br>  5. Make corresponding entries into your CSS file to control the look of that div like this #name {height: 100px; width: 100px; }.  All entries must have opening and closing brackets.  If entering more than one attribute, use a semi-colon to separate them.<br>  <br>  6. Once you are finished adding the divs and editing your CSS, save both files and open your structure and content file in your browser to view.|`|bf5QeTiGaa	Im afraid if you have the latest dreamweaver, its one of the best, so you just need some patience if you want to earn any money from it|`|hiUukkxEaa	Yeah<br>  Your brain is really effective<br>  Learn CSS HTML Photoshop etc and maybe some PHP<br>  Make a blog, like wordpress|`|SYFgUCKFaa	I would advise you to learn ftp or php.<br>  It really helps tons when you learn this stuff:)<br>  xoxo|`|BWEl1TZqaa	Try this : just click and type can build the whole website easily<br>  All files can managed with admin system without learning complex FTP/webeditor softwares<br>  <br>  building a real website with .com or your domain name<br>  is like having a physical store<br>  <br>  3 steps you need to complete<br>  <br>  1. find a physical store (find a server/virtual host)<br>  <br>  you may rent or do it by yourself or but it<br>  <br>  Rent-means you need "virtual host" (search engine can help you)<br>  Do it by yourself - find a computer and set it as a server<br>  <br>  2. put your commodities in your physical store (uploading your contents to server)<br>  <br>  Web contents are placed to the server(photos or texts)<br>  any function you need can install in this stage<br>  <br>  3. name your physical store (domain name setting like www.tsmmc.com)<br>  <br>  let visitors can link to your website by setting DNS server<br>  you may set such server by yourself<br>  <br>  try outsourcing of it - you will save a lot of time

After alot of opening and closing the ribbon cable works its way loose from the connectors that attach it to the motherboard and LCD. Go on the compaq website and find out how to take the keyboard out. Don't just try to take it out. Every one is different. It will take 10 minutes if you have a schematic. And you could break it if you don't .Anyway, take out the keyboard and it will expose the ribbon cable and other connectors. Press the cables back in the connector and anything else that may be loose.Hopefully that will fix it without taking the top half apart. Put the keyboard back in. If its still shorting out, take the top half apart and make sure everything is plugged in.
zorYTX59aa	The famous message "WE'RE SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE"<br>  is typically the result of software which stupidly claims that<br>  they can actually "accelerate" video buffering. This includes <br>  crappy things such as GWA, SpeedBit, Trident, Jaton, ATI, <br>  Diamond Fire and Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" streaming video files. Even<br>  the people at YouTube, Google and Macromedia know this, <br>  and write that in their own FAQs. Thus if you have any kind <br>  of "accelerator"...then dump it, burn it, kick it, rip it, trash it, <br>  uninstall it; do everything you can to get as far away from it <br>  as possible.<br>  <br>  If you do not have one of those moronic utilities, something <br>  on your computer is interfering with YouTube. Thus, please <br>  consider any of these possibilities:<br>  <br>  Not much in terms of playing YouTube vids has changed in<br>  the past 2 years. If anything, all the newer flash players are<br>  causing lots of YouTubers some kind of grief, especially all <br>  5 variations of version 10. It's crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. For the most part, <br>  updates are typically good for one thing: computer/software <br>  problems. I have never strayed away from 9.47, and a lot of <br>  "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think of those 2 like Windows XP <br>  compared to Vista. Take a look at the "Asker's" comments <br>  to this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You may also wish to consider these alternate possibilities:<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Connections (tab) <br>  → LAN Settings (which is the very last button)<br>  → uncheck "Automatically detect settings"<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Advanced (tab)<br>  → scroll down until you reach "Multimedia"<br>  → check-mark all but "Show image download placeholders"<br>  <br>  Two people have written to me saying after they got rid of a <br>  certain software, things seemed to work all right afterwards:<br>  One person got rid of his "nVidia" drivers; the other trashed <br>  his "ad blocking" utility. Do you perhaps have either or both <br>  of these on your computer?<br>  <br>  I've saved my favorite other solution for the end. YouTube is<br>  at its best when you clear all your "Cookies", "History" and <br>  "Temporary Internet Files". My cool "CHTIF" triple-cure has <br>  resolved hundreds of people's problems, so why not yours?<br>  Close out YouTube, do the following, then shutdown/reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  I hope my multiple answer is helpful for you. If you are able<br>  to determine the "cause" and its "cure", I would appreciate<br>  it if you could please let me know, either by clicking on my <br>  avatar or emailing me at "inukjuak90@yahoo.com".<br>  <br>  Note 1: YouTube vids only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is: "Despite the fact that you can't watch or access <br>  videos at all, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE IS FIREFOX 3 AND ITS <br>  INTERACTION WITH YOUTUBE'S (GOOGLE'S) "CACHE" SERVERS<br>  THAT REFUSE THE PLUG-IN'S REQUEST FOR VIDEO FILES. THIS <br>  RETURNS A FALSE ERROR CODE TO YOUTUBE SAYING THAT IT <br>  CAN'T FIND THE VIDEO, OR THAT THE REQUEST DOESN'T MAKE <br>  SENSE.<br>  <br>  OF COURSE, THE VIDEOS ARE REALLY THERE, BUT FOR SOME <br>  STRANGE REASON, YOUTUBE RETRANSMITS THE ERRONEOUS <br>  CODE TO A "THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE" MESSAGE.<br>  WHAT'S THE SOLUTION? NOBODY KNOWS, BUT IT IS A FIREFOX<br>  AND YOUTUBE ISSUE. IF YOU'RE USING FIREFOX 3, YOU MIGHT<br>  WANT TO TRY A DIFFERENT BROWSER.|`|Ev473XbHaa	Sometimes, its just like that. That happens to me sometimes too, then the next day I'll try the same video and it works.

You should try using either Internet Explorer or Firefox for a browser.  Browsers like Google Chrome are still so new and buggy.  Good luck|`|ucYbUqTQaa	This had happened to me once. I had to un-install Java, then re-install Java to make those videos work again.|`|0LQ5CuL0aa	install java and if that does not help try scaning your computer for a virus.|`|r7tllHjuaa	When they say the video is no longer available, they are not lying. <br>  Try to make sure that you have downloaded and installed the proper plug-ings because it is highly unlikely that nothing will work especially on the new computer|`|eCi4UsCAaa	Yes. But be careful.<br>  They Can be bugs on your computer or cause viruses.<br>  So you can install something and if it messes up your computer, install it. or possibly use a proxy.|`|X8Q1zXaMaa	They might not actually be avalible,because recently youtube has been copyrighting everything and even deleting videos!

x2IcwSPOaa	U can read this <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting</a><br>  <br>  Basically scripting  and scripting languages are said to be easier than programming . Scripts can be used to manipulate repetitive tasks such backing up some data daily , so that u write ur script in a scripting language  such as Perl  or Linux Bash  , test it to make sure it , and then let it go .<br>  Scripting languages are used also for manipulating system processing and there are several types of them : some are for server side and others are for client side ( like JavaScript for Web browsers scripting ) .Scripts are converted into the machine language usually  at run time  ( so that the text for the command stays in a text file with a special extension  then a program called an interpreter converts the commands to the computer machine language at RUN time )|`|MTqimWfEaa	It's a lighter version of programming that usually comes with more simple syntax.|`|PviIOflqaa	There are several different kinds of coding languages.  There are languages like HTML, which doesn't resemble programming at all.  There are languages like the one used in an old-fashioned DOS batch file, which is a simple scripting language.  There are languages like C, which is a programming language.<br>  <br>  Different people will draw the line between "just scripting" and "real programming" in different places.  There are a number of languages which easily support both kinds of coding, which makes this line even fuzzier.<br>  <br>  If you write a piece of code, and all it does is streamline a repetitive task that you could do by hand without the code, then you probably wrote a script.  If you write a piece of code that lets you do something you couldn't do by hand, even if you wanted to, then you probably wrote a program.

qq56hk9uaa	Ola Amigon,<br>  <br>  Se você quer iniciar sem utilizar programas de  fazer sites,  e de forma n?o profissional, recomendo come?ar com um Blog no Wordpress ( <a href="http://pt-br.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pt-br.wordpress.com/</a> ), este é o sistema de publica??o de conteúdo e blogs que a cada dia consolida-se como o mais popular do mercado. Ele é fácil de usar, em português e grátis.<br>  <br>  Agora, se você quer um site com uma imagem mais profissional  e com nome de domínio próprio (www.seunome.com.br) vou te dar uma dica que pode poupar seu tempo para criar sites sem necessidade de aprender a usar programas para fazer sites...<br>  <br>  Usar Construtor de Sites On-Line......<br>   <br>  Se você procura algo profissional, recomendo que utilize uma empresa nacional e paga (+ ou - R$ 25,00/mês) . Existem grandes empresas com Construtor de Sites e suporte em português. Este servi?o é um sistema que apresenta em cinco etapas a solu??o para quem deseja marcar presen?a na Internet de forma simples e rápida, sem precisar do auxílio de programadores ou do emprego de grandes recursos e investimentos para elaborar um site. <br>   <br>  Sem maiores complica??es, o Construtor de Sites auxilia na cria??o, produ??o e atualiza??o do seu site grátis com fácil acesso aos recursos e com uma interface simples de ser gerenciada, sem que haja a necessidade de se preocupar com quest?es técnicas de programa??o ou banco de dados.<br>  <br>  Veja como funciona em: <br>  <a href="http://www.creativehost.com.br/construtor-de-sites/" rel="nofollow">http://www.creativehost.com.br/construto...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Dr. Internet diz: <br>  ...Se precisar de mais alguma coisa, email-me!<br>  ....."Pre?o é o que você paga, valor é o que você obtém."<br>  .......Unabra?o...|`|L2v0WfbSaa	Você tem o email do google, o gmail se n?o tem fa?a um e o email é dez, e o blog é facil eu te ajudo se precisar basta falar comigo no msn o ender?o é estes links mas se quizer mais rapido ande seu endere?o do emal do YH que mando a você o convite que facilita o cadastro do email e do blog,<br>  Ah no gmail tem menssager e pode enviar mensagens on line instantanea.<br>  entre em meu perfil e mande um email , depois se quizer outros sites e ver tambem outros blogs, pois ai conhece mais.|`|4152e4ff085c9c4b0444e81f36683180aa	veja o meu<br>  <br>  <a href="http://br.geocities.com/edsonknob/prof.html" rel="nofollow">http://br.geocities.com/edsonknob/prof.h...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  vai na raiz e faz um <br>  no <br>  cria  teu aqui<br>  <br>  <a href="https://www.blogger.com/start" rel="nofollow">https://www.blogger.com/start</a><br>  <br>  edson|`|6C3BxfWhaa	Primeiro: a diferen?a entre um blog/site é esta: o blog é simples, você coloca fotos e textos, coloca seus blog e sites favoritos neles. O site já é mais ajeitado, com mais op??es. Eu recomendo, já que é iniciante, que prefira primeiro um blog. Com o tempo, já pegando o jeito da coisa, crie um site. Um bom lugar para se hospedar um blog é o Blogspot. Mas agora, ele pertence à Globo.com e só assinantes podem tê-lo.

YuvtEhfoaa	Looks pretty good unless you want to do gaming on it. Intel aren't that good with graphics cards, and they are built into the motherboard so switching it up would not be an easy task. I've made the mistake and now saving up for a new PC for gaming. <br>  Other than that it would be a fast PC. Don't let them con you into getting windows live onecare, they are discontinuing it this year.|`|EwYK0VJ4aa	It depends on what you intend on using it for.  If you're merely web browsing or word processing I'd say it should be more than sufficient for your needs.   <br>  <br>  If you intend on doing some serious gaming, I'd say you may have some problems with the cutting edge recently released games.<br>  <br>  Not a horrible deal though, I must say.  Best of luck.|`|7Bx5DYv0aa	Good computer overall.<br>  <br>  1) If you are into high-def heavy duty gaming, this will not work.<br>  <br>  2) If you are not into gaming, then you don't need 3 GB RAM unless you are a super multitasker and have MS word, excel, and powerpoint open at the same time and surfing more than 15 websites simultaneously.  Companies just keep on adding RAM and making money.  We don't really use 3 GB of RAM.<br>  <br>  3)  If you do Oracle Database applications or want to use this laptop as a server, you might need it.  Buying a computer like this doesn't mean, it will last for ever.  It will last the same time as a computer with an Athlon 1.5 GHz processor with 2 GB RAM Or even 1 GB RAM.<br>  <br>  4) you will only need a T3400 2.16 GHz processor with 3 GB RAM if you were into high-def designing such as designing with 3D Max or Maya etc....<br>  <br>  Therefore, if you'd like to save some money, buy <a href="http://www.dealjuggler.com/eMachine-eMD620-5133-AMD-Athlon-Widescreen-Laptop---Only-$369.95-shipped.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dealjuggler.com/eMachine-eMD6...</a><br>  <br>  I just got this 2 months ago and I love it.  It is light, fast, sleek, and cheap.  Save more than $100 and get a great laptop.  It is lighter than the Dell one.  Please take a min to see the user reviews.  I believe the sale is through buy.com.<br>  <br>  Emachine is not very popular, but it is a brand that Bestbuy sells (they don't have this particular laptop though).<br>  <br>  Don't WORRY, it comes with a 1-year warranty like any other company and they have great tech support.<br>  <br>  Hope the above was helpful,<br>  <br>  Enjoy..|`|W3RqvvGHaa	I feel sorry for you. Dell is good but Windows Vista will make you vomit. You will be troubled with Vista's known tendency to screw up when you hook up peripherals (like printers, web cams, scanners, digital cameras, etc). Microsoft quit making it because the general public spends more time fixing than computing :-)<br>  <br>  My advice, save a little more money and get a low-end Mac laptop for $999 and have a trouble-free life :-)

Pv4Z88wPaa	I would start from scratch on this one.<br>  <br>  First reset your wireless router to the default factory settings.  There should be a reset button that you have to press with a paper clip or something like that next to the power input or on the back.  Press in the paperclip and hold it down for about 10 seconds or until your router lights flash a bunch.<br>  <br>  Then power everything OFF including your DSL modem or cable modem.  Work from the wall out powering on each device for a minute before powering on the next one.  Power on your cable or dsl modem and wait a minute.  Then power on your wireless router and wait about a minute.  Then power on your laptop and see what happens.<br>  <br>  If you are still having problems call your ISP and have them check the connection to your modem.  If they say the modem connection is good then follow the instuctions in windows help on repairing a network connection.  I think you can right click on the connection and select repair from the context menu.<br>  <br>  After all of that I would try connecting to a different wireless router...say at starbucks or a freinds house or school.

U go to the installation directory (by default it is "C:\Program Files\MyTribe") and you'll see all of the game files and delete the "MyTribe.exe" file.<br>  4. Then go to the folder where "MyTribeSetup.exe" was and go into the "crack" folder and copy the "MyTribe.exe" which is the cracked exe youv'e downloaded.<br>  5.

When you run the setup program, it should tell you wehre it's installing. Or just look through c:\program files in Windows explorer...)<br>  <br>  3) In the folder you downloaded, there should be a folder called Crack. In there is a file. Right click on it, select Copy. Now go to the folder on your hard drive (as I described in 2), and press Paste (CTRL+V). It may say "do you wish to replace this file?" Select Yes.<br>  <br>  Now - right click on this file again, and select 'create shortcut'.

XbiOTAqvaa	I think your offer to somebody of 10 points on Yahoo Answers for a fantastic idea for a website, along with a good name for it, is a wonderful idea. I think it has real merit and would make for an exciting and vibrant website. All you need to do now is to generate some funding, maybe some venture capital, in any event some serious investment to take your idea from the drawing board to market, which will include concept and design, the very latest in web2 technologies including of course the backend and website and server security. Those are in fact not your major expenses. the latter will be your marketing which should be budgeted at 900% of your development costs. Yeah it sounds a mean feat, but when you think about it, if you can get away with taking somebody else's really, really, really, really, really, really, really good idea in exchange for 10 Yahoo Answers points, then you clearly have "entrepreneur" potential.<br>  <br>  Go for it - the world is your oyster.

ssbkAyWJaa	I just did. J/K! I'm not a very big fan of transformation packs, they can mess up your icons and can sometimes be hard to set them back to the default icons no matter what you do, luckily if you do a system restore, it should restore them back to normal. If you didn't make a restore point and you want to remove OS X, you basically are screwed - you will have to either change your icons with third-party software, stick with the icons, or do a re-install of windows. Windows 7 is by far a transformation pack, increased performance and more visual effects =]

p7NGX4m3aa	jgoulden's answer is getting close.  you do need to use the DAY function.  but the formula he posted is going to return today's day, every day.  if you fill a column with a formula like his, which actually doesn't contain the right syntax for the DAY function (needs to include a paramater), it will always display what day of the week it is, RIGHT NOW.  (every cell).  <br>  <br>  in A2, fill it with a simple date series. example enter 03/01/09 in a2, drag it down until you filled as far as you want. <br>  <br>  in B2, enter this formula; =Day(A2).  drag it down as far as column A went.  <br>  <br>  in C2 enter this, and whenever i click SUBMIT on this answer, it cuts off the second half of my formula.  so just pretend these two lines are completely together, and put them that way: <br>  =IF(B2<4,500,IF(B2=4,600,S<br>  UM(600,SUM(B2-4)*5))) <br>  this does the following: <br>  <br>  if the date is before the 4th, that day's price is 500.  <br>  <br>  if the date is the 4th, that day's price is 600. <br>  <br>  if the date is AFTER the 4th, that day's price is 600 plus $5 times every day it is late.....and only $5 times days after the 4th.  <br>  <br>  is this what you want.|`|NsDO35zhaa	=500<br>  and pay on time or else. =500+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5...|`|3a4bd8a467c49e50aad3ec9ef5e8b130aa	If I'm stuck with Excel I try this site.<br>  So far it's given the right answer every time.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.techonthenet.com/excel/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.techonthenet.com/excel/index....</a>|`|2gjfFsYKaa	The Excel DAY function returns the day of the month as an integer from 1 to 31.

y0kPJJBmaa	backing things up online is not something i would do, but if it works for you, fine.<br>  if you're taking your computer in for repair somewhere, you're more than likely going to lose everything. so - what i would do is - buy a new harddrive, take the current harddrive out - put the new one in, and install windows. actually you can do it yourself and save some money. but if you don't want to, the aforementioned is still your best-bet because 99% of computer 'shops' are going to destroy all your data. <br>  something to think about...

Laptops are the number one STOLEN item in America. <br>  <br>  RUN to Staples or Costco and LOOK at Laptops now.   Toshiba is well made.

It will also make your computer run faster.All are free to download from file hippo.com and download.com<br>  .<br>  ?I know this procedure looks long, but much of this is explanatory text to help less experienced people. <br>  ?Please do not cheat by skipping any steps. You are only hurting yourself if you do. And you will waste more time. The goal is to get your PC fixed. Completing the steps in this generic guide may or may not resolve all of your malware problems, but in all cases it gets your PC into a known state to help make it easier for me to fix your problems. After completing all steps, if you still need help, please send a new question. You may have a problem trying to run steps in safe mode on user accounts that have limited priviledges. This will only be on Windows 2K, XP, & 2003 systems. Limited user accounts will not show when you boot into safe mode. You have two options, run the steps in normal boot mode which may not work to remove malware, or you can temporarily change the user account to an admin account and then complete the steps. <br>  ?0: Preliminary House Cleaning & Setup<br>  <br>  Unistall Malware thru your computers Add?Remove program.<br>  You MUST be sure that MSconfig is not being used to control Startups. Note: That some Window's OSs (like Win 2K) do not have MSconfig! <br>  ?MSConfig Startup Mode <br>  Please go to Start > Run > type msconfig and click OK!<br>  Select the General tab and select Normal Startup. <br>  Thenclick Apply and OK and reboot PC before continuing.<br>  Remain in this Normal Startup mode while your PC is being cleaned of malware.<br>  1: Secondary House Cleaning<br>  <br>  This second step of house cleaning may save a load of time later . <br>  ?Empty any quarantine folders for antivirus and antispyware applications. Make sure you do this. Logs could be huge otherwise. If you are a Symantec/Norton user make sure you empty their Norton Nprotect folder guarding the Recycle Bin. Empty your Recycle Bin<br>  ?Download and install CCCleaner<br>  ?MAKE SURE you download and avoid getting the Yahoo Toolbar version. I do not want you to install any unnecessary baggage. <br>  ?Also it is recommeded to login to all other User Accounts on the PC including the Administrator account which will only show when you boot in safe mode. Run CCleaner on each account. This can greatly reduce scan time and log sizes from the later scanning you will do below.<br>  2: Enable viewing of hidden files, system files and file extensions <br>  <br>  Some programs hide themselves by making their files invisible in normal Windows settings. Not doing this would allow file extensions commonly used by trojans and spyware to be hidden, for example a file ending in .exe or dll making manually finding it, if needed, difficult to impossible. <br>  <br>  <br>  3: Do not use Multiple Antivirus Applications or Software Firewalls <br>  ?Antivirus: If you have multiple antivirus applications installed on your PC, please choose the one you prefer and uninstall all others. Do this now before continuing because you will only be asked to do it later if not done now. This does not mean online scanners. It is only referring to full antivirus applications like McAfee, Symantec, AVG, Avast, AntiVir, Kaspersky, etc. <br>  ?Firewall: Only use one software firewall. Running multiple software firewalls is unnecessary and using more than one software firewall on the same connection could cause issues with connectivity to the Internet or other unexpected behavior including excessive use of system resources which will slow down overall PC performance.<br>  4: Downloading Tools<br>  <br>  Download the following tools and save in your favorite download folder or create one, for example C:\Spyware Tools or C:\Downloads. ( It is not a good idea to download them to any folder within C:\Documents and Settings.) And then install, update, and configure as indicated below. Do not run the scans until later when indicated. Also DO NOT confuse the word download with the actual installation of the program. You should install all programs to their recommended (by the install program). default installation folders. First you download the files and then you install (if the program requires installation) the program. It is also a bad idea to download and save anything you need into any kind of Temp folder. Malware hides in Temp folders and standard cleaning practices will delete everything from Temp folders.<br>  <br>  Download GetRunKey.Zip and ShowNew.Zip from the below links and extract all files from both ZIP files into a folder of their own. You can extract both ZIP files into the same folder. Like C:\MGTools While these tools will run from your Desktop, i strongly recommend that you DO NOT extract them to your Desktop. Please install them where recommended. Do not run the scans yet!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  SpyBot - Search & Destroy <br>  ?PLEASE leave all settings at default!!!! Install, do the search for updates now and get any updates, then fix the below problem with Spybot default products. If you get an error message about "bad checksum" when trying to update, just choose a different server location. Also look for the Immunize feature in Spybot and use it. Do not use the Teatimer function. It can be a resource hog and also makes removal of certain problems more difficult. Make sure you leave the SDhelper ( IE bad download blocker) checked to install (this is the default).<br>  ?Fixing SpyBot's Ignore Products Bug: Please run SpyBot and get into the Advanced mode by selecting Mode and then Advanced mode. Then select Settings and the in the left column select Ignore Products. In the right window pane make sure the All products tab is selected. Then in that window, right click your mouse and choose "Deselect all". Now exit Spybot. We will run a scan later.<br>  Now if running Windows XP, 2K or NT do the below. If you have Windows 95, 98, or ME skip to Downloads for Older Windows OS below. CounterSpy and AVG Antispyware will no longer run on the older Windows's OS.<br>  <br>  CounterSpy<br>  <br>  ?If you had previously used a CounterSpy trial, you may not be able to run it again. If this is the case, then run the below AVG Antispyware Removal procedure and attach the log later.<br>  AVG Anti-Spyware <br>  ?Only run the AVG Anti-Spyware procedure if you could not run CounterSpy. You do not need to run both of these.<br>  Note: If you are using an older Windows OS you may not be able to run some of the above tools! So if you are running Windows 95, 98, or ME run SUPERAntiSpyware and save a log from it so you can attach it. This step is not required if you are running Windows XP, 2K or NT) HOWEVER, no matter what OS you are running, if you could not run CounterSpy or AVG Antispyware then run SuperAntiSpyware.<br>  <br>  <br>  5: Cleaning Malware<br>  <br>  <br>  Important Note Before continuing with the below scans:<br>  <br>  The best method to remove malware is to do it after booting in Safe Mode with no connection to the internet possible and no browsers running. Booting in safe mode is important because best results are achieved since safe mode disables most drivers and running programs. If you cannot boot in safe mode due to the malware problem then run the scans in normal boot mode but make sure you tell us later in any messages you post.<br>  <br>  Thus you will need to print or save these instructons locally in a text file so you can refer to them while offline. Do this before continuing! <br>  ?Reboot into safe mode<br>  ?Physically unplug your cable to the internet (even if you have dial-up, unplug modem) <br>  ?Shut down ALL unrequired applications including browsers <br>  ?Run Ccleaner with the default options to clean out temporary files. Only use the Default Scan on the Windows Tab and select Run Cleaner. Do not run any other options from other tabs. <br>  ?Run Spybot Search & Destroy and allow it to fix all that it finds. Make sure you use the Immunize feature and use the SDHelper function but do not use Teatimer. <br>  ?For Windows XP, 2K and NT users <br>  ?Run CounterSpy - Make sure you have it Quarantine all detections! Also attach the log from CounterSpy later if you still have problems. To get the log after scanning. Click View -> Spyware Scan -> View Spyware Scan History. Next click on the scan you want to view, then click view full details of scan. Right-click anywhere in the window that just opened, click on Select All, right-click again select Copy. Now open notepad and right-click anywhere in notepad and select Paste. Now Save As CounterSpy.txt. If you could not run CounterSpy for any reason, run the steps in the following link for AVG Antispyware Running AVG Anti-Spyware and allow it to fix all that it finds. Save the log as requested and attach it later if you still have problems and have to post a message requesting support.<br>  ?For Windows 95, 98 and ME users <br>  ?you should now run SuperAntiSpyware<br>  6A: Online Virus And Trojan Scanning<br>  <br>  Please run the below two online scanning tools and make sure you save and attach the logs later to any request for help that you post. From step 5 you should already be in safe mode but you will need to reconnect your cable now and possibly reboot and choose Safe Mode with Networking Support. If you cannot connect in safe mode for any reason (like dial-up users), run the online scanners in normal boot mode. You will need to use Internet Explorer to run these online scans. Also MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST SUN JAVA Version installed by checking against the below link which normally has the most current version. This may help prevent some problems in trying to get these online scanners to run. Before installing the current version, you should uninstall all previous versions first!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  *** MAKE SURE YOU RUN BITDEFENDER BEFORE PANDA ACTIVE SCAN ***<br>  *** But if Bitdefender cannot be run then run PandaActiveScan anyway ***<br>  <br>  <br>  Bitdefender agree to the license and then select Scan. DO NOT CHANGE THE OPTIONS TO SHOW ALL FILES SCANNED. Once Bitdefender completes the scan:<br>  <br>  Click-on the Detected Problems tab. When the window comes up to save the report, change the Save as type: box to Text (Tab Delimited) (*.txt) and then in the File name box enter change to bdscan then click save. This will save a file named bdscan.txt in whatever folder you are currently in when you save the file (take notice of where you are at so you can find it later). This bdcan.txt file will actually contain HTML code that i can easily view later while reviewing your log. All i have to do is rename the file to bdscan.html.<br>  <br>  If you do not follow these step, you will have an incorrect log or worse a log summary which is useless to me.<br>  <br>  Panda ActiveScan It will only fix certain viruses and trojans. Most items found will not be fixed. When it finishes the scan click on See Report . Then in the next window click Save Report. The default report name is Activescan.txt. Just save it where you can find it so you can attach to your message when you begin a thread with a request for help. If you have any problems trying to get a PandaActiveScan log,If you use Avast antivirus and it gives you and error like below when trying to use Panda, just disable Avast while your run the scan. The error is a false positive. <br>  Do the following and see what happens......|`|21fa50c23546aad2a9d2f5601f4102c1aa	Try scheduling a boot scan (or whatever they're called) where your antivirus scans your computer right as it starts up, before any other programs start running.|`|57791568a2041c343c02005e077e85e5aa	right click on it and scroll down till you see delete and press it|`|b02u66i1aa	you said that you have used norton,macafee..etc,well these are the  best antivirus on the market.Are you sure that they are up-to-date?If they are ,well there is nothing much you can do than to reformat your hard disk|`|l7wGC8fEaa	USE SPYBOT OR SPYREMOVER THEY ARE THE BEST.

And if you use the Netscape browser, the built-in Composer feature is a superior HTML authoring tool which is totally free. You can easily generate a full-blown website as a Homepage. <br>  <br>  Nevertheless, the "homepage" URL is likely to be "http://homepage.earthlink.com/subscribe... name" and that URL can easily be overwritten via a redirection service, i.e., "mydomain.com" which allows you to link any registered domain name to "mask" another website. For example, should you type in the "domain name," you will be immediately transported to the homepage and the hompage URL of <a href="http://homepage.earthlink.com/subscriber..." rel="nofollow">http://homepage.earthlink.com/subscriber...</a> a homepage URL which will be masked by the domain name. And the charge for the redirection service [even at godaddy.com] is normally FREE. <br>  <br>  When you acquire a domain name, connect it using a redirection service [as discussed above] and submit/publish the domain name on major search engines/directories in order for Net surfers to find your website.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

lObEjUh1aa	to be honest i don't know the first thing about Vista, but i can point out some important differences between 95/98/me and NT/2000/XP.<br>  <br>  95/98/me: based on a hybrid 16/32 bit core that attempts to integrate backwards compatability with legacy 16 bit (DOS) applications and drivers into a 32 bit environment.  sortof notorious for being unstable and difficult to support (hybrid cores are just too complex a design to be reliable).<br>  <br>  some important differences within this core's variants:<br>  <br>  Win95a -- Microsoft's first production release of Windows 95.  disk space was limited as disk volume addressing was 16 bit only.  no USB support.  added "plug and play" functionality, intended to automate driver installation and hardware resource assignment.  in practice, the 1st rendition of PnP lacked a reliable means of identifying hardware (and thus had no reliable mechanism for assigning the correct driver).  also lacking was a comprehensive driver library capable of handling most popular consumer devices.<br>  <br>  Win95b (OSR2) -- MS update to Win95.  primarily known for addition of FAT32 (32 bit disk volume addressing) enabling support for much larger disk volumes.  still no USB support (although USB support was later added to this release in what MS calls "OSR2.1").<br>  <br>  Win98 - USB support ("full" speed only -- limited to 12 Mbps -- no high speed 400 Mbps USB2.0 until WinXP).  added support for AGP graphics (faster, dedicated graphics bus -- as compared to PCI graphics in Win95).  added support for IEEE1394 (firewire).  PnP driver library significantly extended, and some of the hardware identification issues resolved as hardware manufacturers collaberated with MS on a more consistently implemented PCI device identification scheme.<br>  <br>  Win98SE - essentially viewed as a "non-update" by the computer industry, many computer nerds (myself included) saw nothing of significance in Win98SE.  the only purpose of this release (as near as I can tell) was marketing -- MS putting something out there while customers anxiously awaited a new, more stable PC operating system.<br>  <br>  WinME - WinME can support creation of larger FAT32 disk partitions than previous versions of Windows.  several troubleshooting tools added to the aging 95/98 core.  significant UI "window-dressing" added to what is mostly just a series of patches for Win98.  with the WinXP release just around the corner, WinME is viewed as insignificant by many users.<br>  <br>  <br>  NT/2000/XP: single 32 bit core not designed for backwards compatability with legacy 16 bit DOS apps and drivers (though 2000 amd XP both include a DOS virtual machine that can run the simpler DOS applications).  much more stable than the Win95/98/me core.<br>  <br>  NT - Microsoft's first production release of a 32 bit core with no backwards compatability for 16 bit DOS drivers or applications.  makes use of a hardware abstraction layer designed to isolate hardware from applications.  this prevents apps from interoperating directly with hardware, but increases OS stability.  the only Windows OS that does not include a device manager for troubleshooting hardware and peripherals.  uses NTFS, a 32 bit storage addressing scheme with significantly better security and scalability features than FAT32.  marketed primarily to businesses, and released in two flavors (workstation and server).<br>  <br>  2000 - like its predecessor, released in workstation and server versions.  the first MS production release to implement Active Directory (management tools designed to simplify organization and control of large quantities of corporate IT resources).  extensions to NTFS added security features and increased storage volume addressing limits.  device manager added to ease hardware and driver troubleshooting.  in many ways not a good fit for home users (and at its release, WinXP is still almost 2 years away).<br>  <br>  XP - the first MS production release to effectively handle both the needs of the corporate and home user.  extensions to active directory (also incorporated into Windows 2003 server) make IT management easier still.  lots of troubleshooting tools added, making WinXP PCs easier to support than their older Win2000 cousins.  NTFS functionality extended further, again adding security features and increasing volume addressing size limits.  viewed by many as the first fully mature Microsoft OS for the PC ("fully mature" meaning stable, easy to support, and capable of handling high performance peripherals).  forces each application instance to run in isolated, protected memory space, successfully preventing most application hangs from causing the OS (or other applications) to stop responding.  violation of protected memory rules (by issuing read/write calls outside of an app's assigned space) causes immediate termination of the offending application.<br>  <br>  after 6 years of tweaking, XP's PnP implementation is finally working as MS intended back in 1995.  universal device hardware ID strings allow any device that follows the PnP standard to identif|`|AA10091923	go to microsoft website...it will detail for you all of the similarities and differences.  too numerous to list here<br>  good luck :)|`|dxcKEHrQaa	If you dont know anything about computers you should just go with windows XP. 98, ME, and 2000 are too old to be of any use.

4MYWPD9Yaa	You actually have a lot of options here.<br>  <br>  1. You can install Linux inside Windows so that you don't even have to reboot to switch back and forth. The downside is that you need a lot of RAM for this.<br>  <a href="http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox" rel="nofollow">http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtual...</a><br>  <br>  2. You can also set up a dual-boot with Wubi. This is highly recommended, as it doesn't involve repartitioning or replacing the boot loader. It's also easy to remove if you decide you don't like Linux:<br>  <a href="http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/wubi" rel="nofollow">http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/wubi</a><br>  <br>  3. Install Linux in a traditional dual-boot. I wouldn't recommend this, not with Wubi as an option. With this, you decide during installation to resize the Windows partition, create a new partition for Linux, and then the Grub boot loader will replace the Windows boot loader on the Master Boot Record and automatically add Windows to the boot menu. You kind of have to know what you're doing, and if you decide to remove Linux later, it's a bit more complicated.<br>  <br>  4. Install Linux over Windows. This is another option during installation, and it sounds like the exact opposite of what you want to do.<br>  <br>  Go with #1 or #2.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend you start with Linux Mint, which is based on Ubuntu but comes with stuff like MP3 playback and Flash already installed.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	It depends on how you install it.  If you want to dual boot it you have two choices.  The first is to repartition your hard drive.  There are tutorials all over the web for that.

Try:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wubi-installer-org" rel="nofollow">http://www.wubi-installer-org</a><br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.goodbye-microsoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodbye-microsoft.com</a>|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	Yes.

4MYWPD9Yaa	Why do people buy movie or concert tickets instead of sneaking into the theater? Why do you pay for things at stores instead of shoplifting?<br>  <br>  If you like popular mainstream music, you should realize that the record labels that create that music for you invest a lot of money in that music to provide the artists with a small salary and royalties, to upkeep recording studio equipment, to advertise albums and tours, to maintain relationships with radio stations so that you even hear the songs in the first place. That money doesn't come from nowhere. If you want that kind of music to keep getting produced so you can consume it, you should pay for it. Otherwise, you are stealing.<br>  <br>  And if you don't like popular mainstream music, stop pirating it and support indie labels and artists instead:<br>  <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jamendo.com/en/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.magnatune.com/</a><br>  <br>  Jamendo offers free, legal downloads of many independent musicians worldwide who have decided to share their music with the world.<br>  <br>  Magnatune is an independent label with very little overhead (it's just a website, no advertising and promotions) that gives 50% of profits directly to the musicians.|`|okTecGZfaa	A sense of ethics and personal integrity.

You should then perform a search of your hard drive, looking for any instances of normal.dot.  Usually, the normal.dot file is located in C:\Documents and Settings\yourusername\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates.  <br>  Re-start Word.  The normal.dot file will be automatically re-created.

ELF5Y6IQaa	Is this Microsoft Access? To really get a full understanding I'd seriously recommend taking some classes in Access. But here goes anyway:<br>  <br>  1). Create two tables. One table will contain your drop down list options. The other table will reference this table. Example: let's say I have a business and the pay choices are VISA, MASTERCARD, DISCOVER. I'll create a table just for this data. In another table, a field I need to have this drop down list within, will be built using the lookup wizard. So in the design view of the second table, in the data type column, select the down arrow and pick lookup wizard. Then follow the wizard's questions and select the table where the drop down options are (in my example here, it's the table I created for visa, mastercard, discover)<br>  <br>  2. Click the round office button, select access options, select current database, and where "display form" is, click the down arrow and select which form you want to open by default when the database opens<br>  <br>  3. If the relationship doesn't create itself automatically, select database tools on the ribbon, then click relationships<br>  <br>  4. In design view of the form in question, select "use control wizards" to get your button on the form with the picture you see available as your choice. Then click once on the button, look to the right where the property sheet is, select that ALL tab, the caption button already has something there (or should), underneath is "Picture Caption Arrangement". Select the arrangement and select where you want the caption to appear. At the same time, you can edit the caption as you need.|`|g62ATenqaa	To make a drop down list you set that particular field as a look up data type and then type in the values you want. when you switch to datasheet view, that field will have a downward arrow and list of the options you typed in although normally you don't have to use the arrow, just start typing the word you want to choose from the list and it puts it in.  You say you have two things only in the drop down box, if they are merely yes/no, then you set the data type as boolean field/logic.<br>  To create the form on start up this is the switchboard so  if you are pre 2007 from the database window, go up to tools on the menu bar down to switchboard manager and just follow the steps. You can then go into design view of the switchboad manager which after all is only a form and use the existing buttons, retype text on them and assign them to macros which you will set up to automate the whole database.   Once you have linked your tables, you will see a plus sign left side of each record and clicking on that will drop down the relevant info although it is always best to create forms from your tables, and in this instance, create a main form with subforms on it.  Access does have  very good help and also once you set up the tables, to make sure they are right, tools, Analyse.|`|zmPuqU0zaa	To create a drop down list go to your toolbox in form design. Make sure the wizard button is pressed  and then select the combo box tool. The wizard will step you through the rest.<br>  <br>  A splash screen will need a timer interval to display it for so many seconds. You will need to change the start up properties to make sure it is the first form that loads. Also run it from an autoexec macro which loads up the splash and the main form.<br>  <br>  For FREE Access ebook and videos click here<br>  <a href="http://access-databases.com/ebook" rel="nofollow">http://access-databases.com/ebook</a>|`|ffc2e6d63c3d0e7bd58b65ae3981c966aa	it would help if you told us what software are you using.
