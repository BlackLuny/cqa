RzhJr5vVaa	Welcome to Monopoly in the Park, the world's biggest version of the most popular board game ever, and San Jose's new "larger than life" attraction. Here in the park, the real estate market is always booming, as property is traded on a 930-square foot permanent Monopoly board. Now everyone has a chance to make it big in Silicon Valley real estate.<br>  <br>  Large groups can reserve the giant board and game pieces for organized events. Participants play with jumbo dice, don gigantic token-shaped hats, and occasionally even wear jailhouse garb. Monopoly in the Park is Big fun for: Family reunions, field trips, company picnics, birthday parties, and corporate team building events.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is nothing similar to this but there is many more types of Monopoly to get more info go to this site.<br>  <a href="http://www.monopolyinthepark.com/spon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.monopolyinthepark.com/spon.ht...</a>|`|UVUYG5jaaa	you can make your own? but where would you keep it?
e77d4af2a585abc3ccf7f5bbe20755f5aa	You'll have to tear it.  It's a satin ribbon so it will naturally fray like that.  I would say that the easiest way would be to snip a tiny snip where you want the tear to be.  Use a sharp pair of scissors.  This will give you the start.  Now, tear.  It will take a lot of strength because satin doesn't rip very easily if it's good quality.  It will fray and be stringy like the ribbon on the cover.

wYcRdfXmaa	If your teens don't go to school, they will get bad grades which will prevent them from being able to get teen jobs. It can also lower their aspiration if "Get a D report card" is one of their fears<br>  <br>  In order to sneak out, I believe (not certain) that the teens parents have to be asleep. I'm not certain on that however because I never make my teens sneak out.<br>  <br>  Going steady doesn't really mean anything in sims2 terms. All it does is raise aspiration (if "go steady" is one of their wants) and replaces the red love heart under their boyfriend/girlfriend in the relationship panel with two pink hearts. Going steady doesn't present any new interactions between sims.|`|A18FmIQ2aa	I think If you teen does not go to school at all their grades go down and you can not send them to collage until their grades go up and they can't get a job while they are a teen. I don't know why the sneak out won't work. I think going steady means saying you are only going to date each other.|`|NejJjFOraa	If your sims dont go to school there grades will slip they cant go to collage until they get better grades and u can forget abount a teen job|`|6JcDkCaaaa	oh put a wall around him till the bus goes away then delete the wall and then eventally some perople come and take the child and going steady means old fashioned term meaning a couple are going out regularly

You go pick up a shied and you can slam it into the ground as a shield so they can't come up the ramp. You go over by the mortar and just start shooting it by the spawns when they spawn. You can see the whole map and everything. Also, canals is an easy one because the locuts' spawn at the regular spawn points. So if you're playing with 4 other people, you just sit on the bridges right by the spawn points with the boom shot and you can pick up a mulcher from one of the locuts. Canals is the one I beat it on.|`|wyUsVjHBaa	definitely choose the map day one, u can go up in the sniper tower or the other one, but plant a shield by the stairs so they cant get up.|`|oHwP9mPjaa	I did Avalanche, as surprisingly as it may be.

227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	The basement is only useful during the Tenpenny Tower mini-quest. The entrances are in the main lobby in Tenpenny Tower and the other side is only accessible from outside behind the Tower. You'll have an opportunity to choose your path during this quest where you will have access to the disengage button. Until then, don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  To the west of Tenpenny Tower is the train tunnel entrance to the tunnels beneath the Tower. The entrance to the south of Tenpenny Tower is only unlockable from the inside of the tunnel. Once you enter from the train tunnels to the west, you'll navigate the tunnels and come to a platform section where you can unlock the gates leading out of the tunnels to the south of the Tower. These locations are places you'll need to remember when doing the Tenpenny Tower quest.|`|5JwGaB6haa	some where near penny tower<br>  outside though|`|TuCLsWbjaa	I don't know if the ghouls gave you a key, but I found the basement, it's off to the right of tenpenny tower inside the fence.

I think a game like the one your describing would be best Halo style (3rd person in vehicles, 1st person normally.)|`|pws2l0Ckaa	Have you ever read the Zombie Survival Guide?<br>  <br>  There needs to be more zombie themed games these days, even though Left4Dead came out and Dead Rising 2 is coming out, but they both are Xbox exclusives., but Dead Rising 2 might be multi-platform.<br>  <br>  I always thought a GTA 4 download could involve zombies.|`|GgD9Sv0faa	This sounds likes a really cool idea! I know I would play it! In fact, it's like a lot of zombie stories I write!|`|WAOkgdj6aa	Sounds like Silent Hill... and Dead Rising 2 lol
XGBir7OXaa	I created two 'static' groups. I had the top 3 characters, and the bottom 3 characters.<br>  <br>  Each set of 3 had a leader (close combat) who stole first, a healer (w/ranged weapon) and a ranged attacker(either bow or gun).<br>  <br>  I would party with each group until one group was one level above the other group, then switch groups out until that group was a level above the other group and so forth.<br>  <br>  I took full advantage of 'Guests' and leveled my groups as much as I could while the guest was present in the party. This was also the time when I went after 'Marks' and Espers. <a href="http://www.usfine.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.usfine.com</a><br>  <br>  At first I teamed the up with other characters of similar level until they were all the same level, then chose my sets of 3.<br>  <br>  It gets easier as you get farther in the game and you get accessories that increase your exp or increase your points for your grid (or whatever you call it...). I used that to even out the exp as close as I could, giving it to the characters that were behind and not to the character that was ahead.<br>  <br>  Worked for me.<br>  <br>  EDIT: you added the levels... I'd put a 99 in the party as damage dealer, but not the leader and two 18's with him, and take down high powered creatures and see how the exp goes. If the 99 is hurting the rest, then put the 35 in the lead and work them up from there.|`|wPnJekdqaa	Just put one of the low level characters in a party with the high level characters and go somewhere with difficult enemies, like the Henne Mines. Set them to heal/protect/shell themselves and they'll rack up the experience whilst your lvl 99s kill everything that comes at them.|`|yhT2VuUVaa	HUH?

This is done by doing bad things such as killing guards, townfolk, your spouse, and interestingly enough, eating crunchy chicks. But you can also do things within the storyline to becomes less good, such as kill Whisper when you have the chance, or kill your sister when given the chance.
aRuITIv5aa	There is not an "auction house" per se, but there are trading posts. In major cities (hubs) of Hyboria (Old Tarantia, Khemi, and Conarch Village) you can access trading posts. In these locations, you have access to your own personal item vault, an item search facility (to browse for items and other equipment currently tagged for sale), the in-game mailing system (where you can message other players as well as post and receive any sort of item), and your guild bank where any player belonging to a guild can deposit gold, silver, copper, and or tin into the guild savings. <a href="http://www.usfine.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.usfine.com</a><br>  <br>  Purchasing an item tagged for sale is as simple as searching for the item (much like you would in other MMOs), only you don't place bids on the item; you must buy them outright.

pRXejsdXaa	Gears of War 2 is the only one I have so it's the only one I can tell you about. Its pretty short. I think it has like 12 chapters. It also has a Horde mode thats pretty fun.But you could play the multiplayer online for a long time with out getting bored. The only problem is the online matchmaking system SOMETIMES takes a long time to find people. Also people complain about the ranking system. The ranking isnt based on your kill ratio its based on your wins. I dont really care about ranks but yah its a great game so you should get it.|`|28W66KX4aa	I would go with Gears 2 because you have about 20 missions and even horde which is new and the online stuff is great. Fear 2 is improved since the 1 you even get to drive a robot of some sort and even scarier. Skate 2 is just like the 1 well if you played the first.<br>  <br>  I think you should go with Gears 2 and Fear 2.|`|ea0fd099dad3368f5859aed157f9f9adaa	Gears of War 2:  Played it with my friends and it was one of the best games I've ever played.  If your into shooters and games like God of War then definitely get it.  Online I here is very addicting and has lots of play time.  I have not been able to play the online on 2, but I have on Gears 1 and I can tell you that it's pretty amazing.  <br>  <br>  Skate 2:  Great skating game and seems to be the best skating game out there.  The way you do tricks in the game is said to be very realistic and the game (as far as I can tell from the demo) is very solid.<br>  <br>  Fear 2:  Seems to be pretty good.  Reviews seem to be pretty average so don't expect anything out of the ordinary.  Would suggest waiting for Resident Evil 5 that comes out March 17 I believe.<br>  <br>  My Choices:<br>  1.Gears of War 2<br>  2.Skate 2<br>  3.Fear 2<br>  <br>  Hope I could help.|`|F7FAB6ddaa	Gears of War 2<br>  Skate 2 is good <br>  and fear 2 is a fail<br>  get Fallout 3|`|36uns5nRaa	Everyone I know loves gears of war.

wO56y9BYaa	No, even if you don't mess up the r/c car body (which is likely), you may end up with a finish that is prone to cracking and/or peeling.<br>  <br>  Tamyia makes r/c car spray paint.  Regardless, make sure the label of whatever you use states "for polycarbonate".|`|AA10860286	No. That stuff will damage the shell. You need to use the kind that you spray inside the shell that is made for RC shells. You may be able to get away with using the little model car spray cans made by Testor's, but be warned that it might not work either.

1888267d93fdd58ea2bc50aa9735ce96aa	well i'm an addict myself:)<br>  u have to try this game, believe me its very nice<br>  what makes it a bit unique compared to other strategy games, is that is includes anything u can think of in Life (but not war n stuff like that) its more about social stuff.<br>  when playing the game u can design and create the people who ur gonna play with, starting from how their eyebrows look like to their needs and wants in life.<br>  ur creating a person from a-z, genetics, clothes, life aspiration, business aspiration, needs and wants, turn offs and turn ons...almost everything.<br>  after choosing ur family members, u design their house from outside and inside decoration, even wallpaper and floor type.<br>  after u set everything, you make them find the jobs they like, and the kids can go to school too, u control how the adults move on and get promoted and how the kids get good grades. u also make them make friends, best friends, fall in love, get married and have children.<br>  when u buy the sims2 expansion packs (amazing stuff) u can make them own their private businesses, work at home, go out to pubs, gyms, libraries, shopping..etc<br>  u can play at the university and help ur sim graduate with high grades.the latest expansion pack lets u have pets too.<br>  to make it shorter although i used too much details, its an amazing game which u can sepdn hours and hours playing it, controling ur sims and make them accomplish many things in life.<br>  it gives u endless satisfaction and great time.<br>  u'd better take a look at the website www.thesims2.com and take alook at the expansions which are university, nightlife, open or business, glamourlife, family fun stuff and pets.<br>  if ur interested, i advice u to buy the originals from Virgin mega store at city stars (the pc version is the best) and feel free to contact me for more help<br>  enjoy:)|`|2739aa817a733e25044bacbd2b39e2ecaa	i dont know that i play it so much for strategy... i cheat a lot lol. i just like making little people and controlling thier lives. its like playing god! you can also build and decorate houses which is fun b/c i used to want to be an architect.|`|aeb77138951fdbb6dc12f74430e446dbaa	Its about life. You create your character and just play with life. dead or alive<br>  <br>  P.S. your avater is hot|`|f3aef608250cf7744553484c632cefeaaa	Yes it is a great game. It is about you controlling the sims life you control there life and choose what they do and how they live. I like mostly cooking the food on the playstation 2 because you get to choose what to put it in and create something. You just control whether they live die work or stay at home and just have fun. That is what really got me addicted to it lol.|`|0415aec2ced7e97a0484b7b2557e1919aa	Sim1 is much better....Sim2 is too controlling|`|34c3da35bad5bcf9eec80b1ce2e42ecdaa	I just got the Sims 2 yesterday.  I immediately loaded it and played it for hours.  It's hard starting out because there a bunch of new things to learn such as the "Aspirations."  I can't tell you too much about it because I haven't gotten very far myself.  If you liked the Sims 1 then you should like the 2nd.<br>  <br>  The Sims 2 has a different look as well.  It's a lot better in my opinion.  Also, they start you off with three different towns, I think they were called Pleasantville, Stangetown and I forget the last one.  I hear also that you can create your own towns as well.<br>  The game gives you a lot of freedom and you can create families just like in the first one, however, in this one you can actually see a toddler grow into an adult.  It's a lot harder than you would think (but fun!)...you have to make sure they grow into a good child, unless you want them to be dysfunctional.  So you have to teach them to talk, walk etc and also potty train them, put them to bed, tuck them in - it's a full time job!<br>  <br>  Actually I would recommend this game for anyone that is thinking about having a child...it's a good step to see if you can handle a real one.<br>  <br>  With all that said, I'm very much looking forward to running home and playing more of the Sims 2.  You should enjoy it.  Good luck!|`|AA12123697	I got addicted to the Sims mostly because I am going to college for Drafting and AutoCADD. To me, just designing the houses and everything is freaking awesome, but then getting to play the people in their houses, a big plus.|`|dc05acb14cd8ef4d0acc29a54b8d9584aa	I like that its open ended and it can turn out so many different ways.  I also like that they have fears and wants and different aspirations.<br>  <br>  some users have made up their own challenges.  I think the most well known is the legacy challenge.  I know there are others on the sims 2 bbs though.|`|573c1dbbeac620f0d189325d44d3b6ddaa	ya the game is pretty fun i have had it for about a yr and pretty much all u do is play wit familes and make familes build houses and stuff like that. the game gets more fun when u have the expansions i have family fun, nightlife, and open for business and it is so fun when all of them r put together.

But now you have to pay, the Duel Pass Points. One duel per point. I am not very sure about how much a point is; however, I did play in the beta testing. It was more fun than the old version.<br>  <br>  Edit : I believe you are able to purchase them online or buy them at the stores like "Target.." the only store I know that has it. I have not bought them before ever, so I do not know how much are they. <br>  Btw, this person below me is lying, there is no such link and yes, you do HAVE TO pay for playing it online unless you are playing at some private server which that is created by other people. But I do not know any private servers of yugioh-online yet because I stopped playing after the beta test period.
73f13cc2bdd132aa61e542d843226411aa	1.Well Ougi means folding fan<br>  <br>  2.Well i my opinion I'd pick Naruto Narutimate Hero 3<br>  <br>  3.I'd say Gekitou taisen is easier, your basically always in close combat and you don't have to run around that much, plus they have faster combos and  you don't have to buy any combos, they have about probably 10 or 12 less characters than Narutimate.<br>  Narutimate also is a cell shaded game great graphics and great Specials. Also it's slightly cheaper than Gekitou so that's good.<br>  <br>  4. For Translations on Gekitou visit this sites it's kinda use full<br>  <a href="http://home.tiscali.nl/megamika/" rel="nofollow">http://home.tiscali.nl/megamika/</a><br>  Sorry no guide on Narutimate try looking on google|`|b36571363d1cfadf199dae4a06c1c0a3aa	1. no freakin clue! :)<br>  <br>  2. Naruto 4 has alot more charcters and not to mention cool combo cut secenes when u do a three man special<br>  <br>  3. probably 2 one because not as new as the 3 one cause the 3 one i think u can buy super hard mode and the combos i think u don't have too<br>  <br>  4.

UeVpvzhVaa	CO2 is a compressed gas.  When pressurized it becomes a liquid.  A CO2 tank is only capable of withstanding roughly 800PSI.  The PSI needed to fill and run a gun on compressed air is at least 3000 PSI.  In addition, most home air compressors are only capable of filling up to 175 PSI…that would only give you 50 or so shots (if it even powered the gun).  Spend the money and get your tank filled properly…this will keep you from ruining your equipment and hurting yourself.|`|QkBnGqTUaa	First of all, if it a tank that is writen 20 OZ it is made for CO2 and only that. Second of all, if you go buy a thank for compressed air, you wont be able to refill your thank with your dads compressor because most probable your compressor will give you only up to 350 PSI, to fill a tank properly you will need a compressor that give you at least 4500 psi. so forget about refilling your tank with air. go with co2. If you still want to refill buy your self, go with co2 you can buy a 20 pound bulk tank for around 180$ and with a thank like this you could refill your 20 oz about 15 times. so to get your money worth you will need to refill your tamk 30 times before you getting a worth for your money.. after the second refill of your bulk tank you will be getting back on you money because the tank is paid.|`|fa8832aa9db6da18ddb3875bc902da3eaa	2 points!!!!|`|omug8QhBaa	CO2 is a much more compressible gas... regular air cannot be compressed nearly as much as the CO2 can. A regular compressor probably/most certainly cannot exceed 350Psi.<br>  <br>  You would need a special compressor to do so.|`|ahRXIkbmaa	CO2 liquifies at a relatively low pressure. CO2 will not only provide more shots, but since the pressure is maintained by the liquid CO2 boiling to replenish the gas, the pressure remains constant until the liquified CO2 is all evaporated.

XJyyxT31aa	To protect yourself from moves such as Night Shade, Seismic Toss, and Dragon Rage.<br>  <br>  Night Shade's and Seismic Toss' damage depends on the user's level. If the user's a level 100 Pokémon, it'll do 100 damage to the defending Pokémon. Therefore, your Pokémon loses 100 HP.<br>  <br>  Dragon Rage is not much of a threat though, since it'll always do 40 damage.<br>  <br>  Even if your Pokémon has a high amount of DEF/ SP. DEF, it won't be able to withstand these attacks.|`|EJMZi7Y4aa	Even if a Pokemon has high Sp. Def and Def it can easily die if the opponent has enough Attack and/or Sp. Atk to overcome the Def, AND it is a type advantage. If I had a Pokemon with stupid HP, but good Defense and Special Defense, it can still get the faint from a Type Advantage move because of the Double OR a Critical Hit. So yeah.|`|snsWMnOaaa	its your health
AcG0hbyIaa	you trade them to learn move's. you find them underground. go exploring once you get your explorer kit and so some digging.you'll find some eventually.... i got 32 that way|`|RfkmNcnvaa	im not sure how to get it in pearl, but you use them to give to the move learner guy - and he teaches your pokemon any move they can llearn ^_^
50jtX73Oaa	I will preface this with I do not have diamond and pearl but have logged hundreds of hours on Ruby and Sapphire, the natures of the Pokemon are random, So if you want one with a specific nature keep throwing balls at them until you catch one with the nature you want. Or trade from someone who has the pokemon with the nature you want.
pcbizezSaa	no.  Choice band is a object that makes your pokemon use one attack only.  Say you have choice band equiped.  Use a attack, and then that attack will be used infinetly for that match.

The best information can be found on the site below, but let me offer a primer...<br>  <br>  Your "team" must be an actual team, not just a collection of six pokemon you like/are powerful. They must be able to cover eachother's weaknesses, they must synch offensively(having Tyranitar, Hippowdon, or Abomasnow while other teammates try to take advantage of Rain Dance is ill-advised....you're screwing yourself up.), and they have to boast some unique way to bring the opponent to his knees. Maybe you utilize moves like Knock-Off and Sneak to mess with your opponent's items and give you the edge. Or maybe you team Stealth Rock and Spikes with Roar and Whirlwind to rack up damage on the other team by forcing them to switch or die. But you need something more than "lolz Charizard is teh leet. He use Blast Burn to pwn everything."<br>  Not an insult, I'm sure you;re away that that's not a strategy at all...nor is it wise...|`|601b5c52a5da3caabeb73b206a3f6fd0aa	level em up...duh?

If you follow this approach, you'll hear about standards and learn how to read music.  But if you just want to play guitar quick and easy, here's a list of things to do.  Assuming you've never played an instrument - here's what I'd suggest.<br>  <br>  1) Look at a piano. I know you're learning guitar - but it's easier to visualize on a piano.  All instruments have 12 notes (regardless of the instrument).  Let's learn these first.<br>  <br>  2) Look at the white & black keys on the piano.  Do you see a pattern?  Count the white keys between the patterns.  You'll find 7 white keys.  These seven keys (which get repeated for each higher or lower "pattern" also called, "octave") are seven notes from C, D,  E, F, G, A & B (the pattern generally starts with C).  After G, the notes start over again with "A" in a new "pattern" or "octave".<br>  <br>  3) Now look at the black keys.  There are 5 of those in between each pattern/octave.  These are called sharps (or flats depending on your perspective). C#, D#, F#, G#, A# (also known as Db, Eb, Gb, Ab, Bb).  The "#" is pronounced "sharp" and simply means 1 black key higher than a white key where the "b" is pronounced "flat" and simply means 1 black key lower than a white key.  The guitar has the same concept of notes, flats & sharps.<br>  <br>  4) Notice there is no E# nor B# - that is, an E# is an F.  And a B# is a C.  If you don't know why - look again at the pattern of white and black keys on the piano again.  The pattern explains the reason.<br>  <br>  5) Now let's look at a guitar.  The metal bars running perpendicular to the neck are called frets.  The same 12 key pattern (with 12 notes of 7 + 5 sharps/flats) are found between the frets.<br>  <br>  6) Pick up the guitar.  Start on any string and play that string open (which means pluck the string but do not press any frets).  Hear that sound?  <br>  <br>  7) On the same string press between the first fret and the bridge of the guitar (way way up at the top of the neck) and pluck the same string again.  Did you hear that sound?  Follow that pattern for 12 notes.  Notice on the 13th note that this note sounds just like the open or 1st note you played, only an octave higher.<br>  <br>  8) So now you know there are 12 notes in each octave (the 13th note represents the same as the 1st note only an octave higher in pitch).  7 + 5 sharps = 12 notes.  And you sort of know how to play each of these notes on the same string.<br>  <br>  9) The next important step is identifying those notes.  Let's start with the bottom string on your guitar (the thinnest string).  This string is called, "E" because when tuned properly, the open note or 1st note on that string is in the tune of E.  Play the E on your guitar (open), then the E# (which is again accomplished by pressing BETWEEN the first fret and the bridge on the same string and plucking the string).  Play all 12 notes E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B, C, C#, D & D#.  Find the 13th note - play it and compare it to the 1st or open note.  Do they sound the same?  Answer - yes.  They are both an "E".<br>  <br>  10) There are 5 other strings on your guitar (assuming you play a standard 6-string).  From bottom (smallest) to top (fattest), these strings are E, B, G, D, A & E.  Play each of the notes on each string.  For example, on the 5th string A, play A (open), A# (1st fret), B (2nd fret), C (3rd fret), C# (4th fret), etc.  Play all 12 notes on each string.  Notice and compare again the 13th note to the first note - they should always sound the same, only an octave higher.<br>  <br>  11) So now you know roughly what each note is on each string.  With practice you'll know when, where & why to play each note.  For the next steps, you will also need to know how to properly tune the guitar.  I'll assume you can figure that out on the internet or get someone to help you.  From here, there are many different ways to go.  I'm going to walk you through Chords next.<br>  <br>  12) A chord (pronounced, "cord") is simply a collection of notes together.  To simplify your life, think of Major chords as 3 notes played together at the same time, which when played together make a happy sound.  Think of Minor chords as 3 notes played together at the same time, which when played together make a sad sound.  Back to the piano, find the middle "C" key.  This is the key in the middle of the piano - to it's left is another white key, to it's right is a black key.  Now play the C, E & G keys together at the same time.  Did you hear that?  Pleasant isn't it?  That is called a C-chord.  Now, find the E on the piano.  Now play the E, F# & A (remember the F# is a black key).  This is called an E-chord.  Each Major chord on a piano or a guitar is made up of 3 notes which when played together sound happy.  Here are the 7 Major chords:<br>  C-chord : C, E & G.<br>  D-chord : D, F# & A.<br>  E-chord : E, G# & B<br>  F-chord : F, A & C<br>  G-chord : G, B & D<br>  A-chord : A, C# & E<br>  B-chord : B, D# & F#<br>  You'll notice I didn't list the Sharps/Flats, Minors, 7ths Diminished, 9ths, sustains, major-7ths and a whole range of fancy jazz chords.  Let's stick to the basics for now.  Major chords.<br>  <br>  13) Now let's try our first chord on the guitar.  This I think is the most fundamental of all chords on the guitar - it's called the E-chord.  From the list above you can see the E-chord consists of E, G# & B.  On the guitar, we are going to accomplish this by playing all 6 strings at the same time in one- long strum and by playing these notes: 1st-string E, 2nd-string B, 3rd-string G#, 4th-string E, 5th-string B & 6th-string E.  Here is how to play this on your guitar:<br>  <br>  E|-----------|------------|-----------... <--- Bottom (little E) string<br>  B|-----------|------------|-----------... <br>  G|----1-----|------------|------------... <br>  D|-----------|------2----|------------... <br>  A|-----------|------3----|------------...<br>  E|-----------|------------|-----------... <--- Top (fat E) string<br>  <br>  On this chart, the "1" is your pointy finger.  The "2" is your birdy finger and the "3" is your ring finger.  You can also switch 2 & 3 around if it's more comfortable for you.  Practice putting your hands in these positions represented above and strum.  At first it may not sound right - you'll have to play with various combinations of pressure and timing on the fret board to make it sound right.  Your fingers will become raw & tired from this - your first time.  It's OK - don't give up.  You need to develop a hard callous on your fingertips to play well anyway.  This is your first E-chord!<br>  <br>  14) Now let's play another fundamental chord.  The A-chord.  From the chart above, we know the A-chord consists of A, C# & E.  We are going to accomplish this on the guitar by playing all 6 strings at the same time in one- long strum and by playing these notes: 1st-string E, 2nd-string C#, 3rd-string A, 4th-string E, 5th-string A & 6th-string E.   It looks like this:<br>  <br>  E|-----------|------------|-----------... <--- Bottom (little E) string<br>  B|-----------|------1----|------------... <br>  G|-----------|------2----|------------... <br>  D|-----------|------3----|------------... <br>  A|-----------|------------|-----------...<br>  E|-----------|------------|-----------... <--- Top (fat E) string<br>  <br>  Some people leave off the 6th string E and use different fingers for the strings - play around and find what is comfortable for you.  Just press the right frets and you've got it.<br>  <br>  15) So now you can play an A & an E.  Practice switching between these two chords quickly & easily while strumming.  Practice your strum timing - play with a beat track if possible or metronome.<br>  <br>  16) There are many many other chords you can learn.  Find them here : <a href="http://www.guitaralliance.com/guitar_lessons/guitar_chords/common_open_chords.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.guitaralliance.com/guitar_les...</a><br>  <br>  17) I'm now going to teach you the QUICK & EASY way to play any song in the world.  It's called, "Bar Chords"  With this technique, you can play just about any song you want (except fancy jazz chords).  Bar chords are nothing more than the 2-chords you've already learned (E & A) but played on different frets.  Remember how I told you "1" in the charts above was your pointy finger?  Well, with bar-chords you will be using your pointy finger to "clamp" over a fret which leaves only 3 other fingers to play the notes required.  So for the E & A chords you've just learned, practice these again but DO NOT use your pointy finger - use instead your birdy, ring & pinky fingers to play these chords.  When you've mastered that move to the next step.<br>  <br>  18) Now that you've mastered A & E with 3-fingers (birdy, ring & pinky), you've freed your pointy finger to act as a CLAMP over a fret.  This is the secret to Bar Chords.  Example.  Play an E-chord.  Now, move all fingers up 1 fret and CLAMP your pointy just slightly behind & not quite on the first fret (this means press all 6 strings down with your pointy finger, like a CLAMP and use your other 3 fingers to make the form of the E-chord).  If you can master that chord, you're now playing a bar-chord F.  Move up another fret, again using the same finger positions as the E but pointy-finger-CLAMP on the 2nd fret, now you're playing an F#.  Got it?  Go up and down the fret board with the E-based Bar-Chord.  Play the E, F, F#, G, G# chords.  Got it?<br>  <br>  19) You can play alot of songs this way - but it's helpful to also learn the A-bar-chords as well.  So, once again, play an A-chord.  Tip : you can play an A-chord with 1-finger.  Trust me on this.  Use your ring-finger to press the appropriate frets for the A-chord (you were using 3 fingers to play an A, now you're using only your ring finger to accomplish the same chord).  Use only your ring finger.  You can do it.  You need to master this for A-bar-chords.  OK, now that you've figured that out, move up 1 fret and CLAMP with your pointy finger on the first fret and use your ring-finger to play the obligatory A-chord (only 1-fret up).  Now you're playing an A# using the A-chord structure!  Go up and down the fret board playing the A, A#, B, C, C#, etc.  Got it?  You're now playing the A-bar-chord.<br>  <br>  20) With the A & E bar-chord techniques you can play almost any song.  You need to practice strumming to the rhythm and switching at the appropriate time.  It will also help you to learn 7th's and Minor chords as well.  You can bar-chord these also and with this combination - any song is in your grasp. <br>  <br>  21) If you want to see pictures of bar-chords, go here.  <a href="http://guitarsecrets.com/bar_chords.htm" rel="nofollow">http://guitarsecrets.com/bar_chords.htm</a><br>  <br>  22) Send me an email with questions : go_speed_racer_2000@yahoo.com.<br>  <br>  Have fun.

c97884712264a19f23634b93afda8d19aa	The Answer will_smith_the_white gave is incorrect.<br>  <br>  The most powerful bow in Fable and Fable: The Lost Chapters is Skorm's Bow (it has lightning and sharpening augmentations, and does 264 damage), which can be obtained in Darkwood Chapel of Skorm. The entrance to the Chapel can be found in Darkwood Camp, a place you will stop for a short time in while doing the Trader Escort Quest.<br>  <br>  However, getting to the Chapel is the easy part. Getting the Bow (which is a Legendary Weapon) is the tricky part, as your sacrifice at the Chapel must meet certain conditions (such as current alignment) or else your sacrifice will only net you evil points. There is actually a bit of debate as to what is the *correct* way to get the Bow. Below are some options.<br>  <br>  Here's what to do (if you're completely neutral):<br>  <br>  1. Walk to the Chapel  of Skorm<br>  <br>  2. Teleport to Oakvale, and hire the mercenary in the near the Graveyard entrance<br>  <br>  3. Recall/Teleport back to the Chapel<br>  <br>  4. Teleport to Bowerstone South and hire the mercenary in the Tavern<br>  <br>  5. Recall/Teleport back to the Chapel<br>  <br>  6. Save your game in a new slot (to fall back on should you mess up)<br>  <br>  7. Enter the Chapel and approach one of the worshippers<br>  <br>  8. Wait unitl midnight (when the sky clock shows the horizon <br>  line as being completely horizontal. In Lost Chapters, a voice will also say, "Lights out, you horrible lot!" at midnight)<br>  <br>  9. Wait for the mercenary to take his pay (you will notice your money bag depleting on the bottom of the screen)<br>  <br>  10. Talk to a worshipper to sacrifice a mercenary<br>  NOTE: Be sure to use the yellow Y button to skip dialog <br>  <br>  11. Talk to the worshipper again to sacrifice the other mercenary<br>  NOTE: You need to make both sacrifices after the midnight, but before the next payment<br>  <br>  12. Enjoy the most powerful bow in the game<br>  NOTE: If you mess up, you can always reload. The first link in my sources outlines what I've already told you (it's under "4) Getting Skorm's Bow").<br>  <br>  As noted above, your current alignment plays a big part in when you need to make the sacrifices. The second link in my sources is on if your evil fills up half the bar. Just Find ([Cntrl]+F) "SB~" (without the quotes). This link suggests that half-evil characters need to wait until 6 a.m. to make the sacrifices.<br>  <br>  The third link in my sources is another option when obtaining Skorm's Bow. Refer to Section IV of the FAQ. This option has you sacrifice one mercenary at 11 p.m. and the other at midnight.<br>  <br>  The fourth link in my sources has another good option. Refer to the "5.9  -  Temple of Skorm" section in the FAQ.<br>  <br>  NOTE: I've tested the first, third, and fourth options before, and have been successful with all three. There seems to be a bit of randomness involved, so you may not get the Bow right away even if you follow the steps to a 'T'. Just keep at it, and you'll eventually get the Bow.|`|JY9DO82Taa	u know those talking stone head things? do all there missons and you will be rewarded with it!

c22c4ab65d489757869959200d2c004aaa	There isn't a specific day of the week that he only comes out on. He is on the list of Pokemon that do not appear in the Great Marsh regularly. What the game does is randomly pick one Pokemon from the following list;<br>     - Croagunk<br>     - Skorupi<br>     - Carnivine<br>     - Golduck<br>     - Roselia<br>     - Staravia<br>     - Marill<br>     - Azurill<br>     - Wooper<br>     - Quagsire<br>     - Bidoof<br>     - Bibarel<br>  <br>  and place in in the Marsh. Your best bet is to use the binoculars to try and find him. You can't really compare what you see in them to the list and then say 'Oh well, he wasn't chosen today' as a lot of them on the list appear in the Marsh ANYWAYS without being the daily one (stupid game). I do know that it appeared more often after I got the National Dex though..|`|6p95XDyaaa	I took a Carnivine with me to the Great Marsh and used Sweet Scent to attract Croagunk.

There are certain exceptions, like the Ultima series or Mule, but those are special cases.  The fact that your games are on cassette and without cases drops the value even more.<br>  <br>  The value of used classic software is really driven down by how easy it is to download and the fact that there's really a lot of crap out there.

W9ij8rgraa	It depends on the extent of the damage. There are products you can buy at places like Best Buy or Target that claim to fix scratches in CDs, DVDs, and games, but those are generally  most successful on lightly scratched discs. There are also companies that you can send the disc off to and they'll fix the game, but those can get rather expensive. I'd pick up one of the do-it-yourself systems (like Game Dr.), and try it that way. If it doesn't work, at least the cleaner is reusable in case you have any other scratched games in the future. Good luck!

tVADtAKFaa	Unlike the typical evolution process (evolving at a certain level), Golbat evolves into Crobat when its happiness rating is high. A Pokémon's happiness rating can be measured in different ways throughout the games. In the GSC series, there is a woman in Goldenrod City who will rate the happiness of the player's Pokémon, and in the RSE series, there is a woman in Verdanturf Town who will also rate the happiness of your Pokémon. However, having its happiness rated does not have any effect on a Golbat's evolution; it only gives a rough measure of when it will evolve. When a Golbat is sufficiently happy, it will evolve into Crobat the next time it levels up.<br>  <br>  In the FireRed and Leafgreen games, if Golbat levels up and is happy enough it will evolve into Crobat, but the player has not received the National Pokédex, it cannot evolve: it will attempt to, but will inexplicably stop. It will not evolve until the player acquires the National Pokédex and thus can log Crobat's data in it.

de9b418251ba098ce3c369819ab58f1caa	Well, I usually take Hatshepsut because of culture (it expands your territory) and and spirituality (your country never goes in revolution) but Gandhi is good also. First you should make either your scout or warrior (depends which you start with) scout. And, of course make a city with your settler. Then, in your city, make another warrior to defend it (when its ready make it defend and create another one). For the technology, it depends what you want to do... If you want to destroy your opponents soon in the game, go with millitary and economy... if you want a prosperous beginning choose  growth and science. Then, when u have about 3 warriors, make a worker, then a monument, and then a granary. This should give you a good start.|`|9bHyCYweaa	It is really boring it doesn't make sense|`|AA10836670	i've never played Civilization IV but i've played C. III, and the basic way to get a good start is to make lots of farm areas near ur place (within ur border), then head out with workers and connect to resources w/ roads... (first explore with ur cheapest warrior) (and also make a settler or two and build a second city near-far from ur starting point...) (meaning somewhere where ur first city's boarder dont reach but not too far where u cant go and defend it)<br>  <br>  good luck....
Yk7k23YSaa	Technically (the legal answer) M3 DS Real is a MultiMedia player that allows you to play music, movies, picture slide shows and homebrew games on your Nintendo DS.  These are all accomplished by downloading said items from your PC to a microSD or microSDHC card.  When you get the item there's the small matter of having to update the firmware but that's simple enough and the instructions online are fairly easy to follow.  You can pick up an M3 DS Real from this site:  www.kickgaming.com.  They're in Canada (not Korea or China or some other place from where you're likely to be ripped off) and I personally have had great shopping experiences with them.  They'll be able to link you to any number of FAQs if I didn't answer your question as fully as you would have liked.  OR you could try www.m3adapter.com.

1hNyVKdAaa	i love the atari 2600 also,  in our time(you must be in your late 30's or 40)   i still play it today.  it was great because the games were fun and simple, graphics were second to the fun factor. plus everyone had one.  today its all about graphics . show them a few games ( pitfall, yars revenge, etc.)  those were great games. games of skill not graphics.  maybe they can appreciate them a little more.|`|AA11709651	Wow, that is a tough one... With all the improved graphics of todays consoles, it is hard to convince them that there is probably a better console than these. Or at least better games. Try an emulator, since I am quite sure you cannot find one of those anymore, unless you are lucky. Let them play a good game for a bit. But warn them, that the graphics are not good, since it is an old console. I just hope they are not into sports, or that makes it quite impossible. No way to beat FIFA or Pro Evolution, in all aspects...|`|xBGEcPvCaa	not possible.|`|WQB8wUozaa	I agree with masterx get one for them to try!|`|c5qCjzJAaa	Time changes, generations change...<br>  I still believe my mega drive is the best console ever, but keeping an open mind is always good for innovations.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it's a good idea to introduce them the Atari, or just play it yourself.|`|dF27CS3Vaa	Get them an atari 2600 or atari flashback2

a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	The KEY thing is to select something you KNOW and LOVE.  ALSO, TRY to find something that can be SEEN from the back of the class, and if it CAN'T, make sure you have illustrations.    Oh My, flashbacks !! I had to do this for public speaking in High-School, College, and then in the Navy during Instructor training...    In high-school I showed "how to" pack a back-pack for camping, including things NOT to carry and why.    In college I showed "how to" cook General's Chicken... I carried in a camp-stove and my wok and cooked for the class.    In the Navy, I showed "how to" dress in cold-weather flight gear.    GOOD LUCK !!|`|SG1VBEwraa	paper origami?|`|fvre0o9laa	1) Talk about something you know thoroughly.    2) Talk about something that will fit in the allotted time.    3) If it's going to be a demonstration, show something that can be seen from the back of the room.  Work on your visuals.    4) Know your audience.    One that I did many years ago for a three minute class speech was to teach a simple coin pass, the basis of a lot of magician's coin tricks.  But it was a small class, and everyone could see (and try it themselves because I handed out pennies).    One I did in a much larger class was to stick bamboo skewers through an inflated balloon without popping it... that was much more easily seen by a class of 100.  (And besides, the teacher said we should start our speech with a bang to interest the class, so I took it literally and did a "this is not how" at the beginning.  )    What are you interested in?  What do you know how to do?  What would interest your audience?|`|N1C8Czxbaa	Okay so when I was in college I had a public speaking class and I remember I did mine on how to bake brownies. Obviously I didn't actually bake them or anything but I showed all the steps and then at the end told them that they would bake them at a certain temperature for a certain amount of time.  So you could do something like that or show how to cook anything, it doesn't have to be brownies.|`|7227e0e810180e78f47256ce93f3a10faa	:D well if i had to give a speech i'd talk about the one true thing I love.  Find something you really love to do and explain how You do it.. not anyone else's way, but yours :)  May it be the act of making something or just stupid stuff such as the act of acting :) (its my hobby)  FInd something you really enjoy doing and then everything else will come easy. its not all that hard to talk in front of people, its just hard because you don't know them well enough.. :D  Hope it helps|`|45I3X5U5aa	Well cooking/baking something is always a good choice!

I think I got a good grade on that one.|`|fcN64i5Faa	i go with paper origami as well, there's a website that you can find all kinds of origami's to make. here it is:|`|0bYcYz2jaa	Does your speech have to have a demonstration too?  If not, you could talk about how to make your favorite dish, anything from homemade cookies to a simple salad.  If you have a skill that you would like to showcase such as knitting, belly dancing, martial arts, etc. you can talk about how to complete a knit piece, performance dance, or mastery level.  The important thing is to know your subject.  Good Luck!
nkA5NMUsaa	is it a collection (sorted and placed in books) or an accumulation (a whole lot of coins in cans,jars,bags etc?  contact a coin dealer.so much depends on market for mexican coins,condition etc.  for US coins maybe 1 in 2000 might be worth more than the face value.|`|127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	For get the pawn shops, you need to see a world coin dealer for few U.S. coin dealers know anything about world coins. You can figure the ones made of silver have value for the silver. Collector coins are usually the ones from 1940 and older. The ones from the early 1900's as well as the 1700-1800's. There were some larger silver commemorative 5 and 10 Peso's from the 1950's and up. Hope this helps. See if a coin club is near you for they would have world coin collectors who would help you.

So if you see one space circled by 1s that means it's obvious it's a bomb.|`|LHt5N7Csaa	All you do.. is you hit the boxes and for example if there is a box and around it is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or 8 then thats how many bombs are around that box. whatever number it is.<br>  <br>  so if theres a 1 then that box you clicked on.. around that box there is 1 mine. got it?|`|tOMkK6CXaa	press any squares then try to not hit bombs or ull die

Coronet. Be sure to bring plenty of ultra balls to catch Dialga. DO NOT USE THAT MASTER BALL! Save it for a pokemon like Giratina: he's a lot harder to catch. Dialga is easy. It is on level 49, so have a strong fire type on hand. It should know ancient power, roar of time, metal claw, and dragon claw. Save b4 you battle it. You will also have to battle team galactic. yikes! Oh well, stock up on plenty of full restores and revives and you should be fine. Make sure your pokemon are all on levels in the upper forties.

FVRDpmCXaa	Alot of ppl like totodile as its evolution feraligator is quite good(attack and def wise).... I dont like him tho... For a water/electric type i'd choose lanturn! Its ability volt absorb makes it immune to electric attacks! It even convert electric attacks to hp! Lapras is a very good pokemon also. It can learn LOADS of moves of many different types! And try to get one with the ability water absorb(*like volt absorb but with water^^). Skarmory is a good pokemon also! And so is gastly(until you can get a misdrevous anyway^^). Also blissy makes a good tanker due to its incrediable hp and sp def! A tyranitar is always a good addition 2! Oh! And sneasil! MAybe a dragon type... Like a Dragonite? And a smeargle is always good, its sketch move lets it copy ANY attack ^^Anyway those are the best pokemon I can think of without legendaries...|`|X5iEk8Ojaa	i think you should keep cyndoquil because the evolution of it is really very powerful and when i played through gold, i was able to beat any pokemon that i came up against with it.  tyrannitar is also a great powerful pokemon.  dragonite is also of course very good.  i would say to have a ghost like misdreavus on the team because they cant be affected by normal type moves...a good psychic pokemon like espeon would also be very helpful.  when i make my teams, i just try to focus on having the largest array of attacks and resistances so that im ready for any situation.  anyway i hope i helped!|`|khP0HaQNaa	that guy who answered first, GIVE HIM THE POINTS. i was gonna say keep cyndaquil and also get tyranitar, dragonite and a good water like lapras and it is so cool but give the guy up top the points he said a lot of things.

yCju0BdZaa	i suggest raikou and tyranitar. raikou is not a uber and has extremely hugh sp.atk and speed. tyranitar has high attack and defense and is great as a physical sweeper. for raikou, modest nature would be the best bet. give it extrasensory, shadow ball, thuderbolt and calm mind to raise its amazing special attack. for tyranitar, prefered nature would be adamant. give it crunch, dragon claw, earthquake and stone edge. if you take these two pokemon with you then your team would be really well balanced.    hoped i helped. =)|`|FVRDpmCXaa	get a spiritomb and lanturn(with volt absorb)|`|7bfd3a34799583091c4292e215561a5daa	Get a good ground type, ground is one of the most offensive types. If you can something like Swampert. and if you do get Swampert, teach it Ice Beam or something like that for defense against grass type Pokemon. Good luck!|`|f5Yt5tVoaa	get a roserade (grass type) and a garchomp you can get it as a gible under neath the cycling road theres a secret entrance to the left
2aJ0qDEjaa	Ah rookie eh, That's a very decent team, for the third badge, you'll fave Fighting types in veilstone, fighting is weak ageist phycic and flying types, use metangs phychic attacks, but its a steel type too so her fightign moves will be strong agist it, i suggest catchign a kadabra, or teach some phychic moves to metang, she also has a lucario, thats strong agist fighting type|`|FVRDpmCXaa	Very good team! Youmight want to look into getting a fire type when you can tho...<br>  And your gengar will dominate the next gym leader!|`|ZDu3R6aZaa	It's looking good so far. I suggest finding some sort of fire pokemon though.|`|7Z5K82LDaa	pretty good for a starter team its well balanced too. level up gabite and turn it into a garchomp if you want a 4/5 attack and 4/5 speed, but if you're an all out attacker (like me) level up metang and tun him into a metagross for 5/5 attack and 4/5 defense. choose garchomp if you like fighting quickly and evasively but choose metagross if you like attacking all out and is prepared to take a lot of hits|`|Hw7TENhPaa	Thats a good team u got.... First of all, tho, ur starter pokemon should be strongest. Also, u should grab a grass and fire pokemon in ur team. get a flying pokemon too. work hard, and u'll be fit for the pokemon league.

Okg8fd1baa	Heros for Hire|`|PrQdLmcjaa	Lordom
FVRDpmCXaa	Personally, my fav water Pokemon is Lanturn. Purely for the ability-Volt absorb! Electric moves are only beneficial to it! It converts them to hp! And for flying, i like Zapdos, but if your staying away from legendaries(which i assume you are) I'd go Skarmory or avoid the type all together... I don't much like Roselia(very picky i know!) but i just don't like its moves... I'd kick grass and get a decent ice type-frosslass or glalie. And my new favorite Pokemon is Spiritomb! No moves are super effective against it!|`|C0k07fxuaa	nope i can not even rate this.<br>  it dosent have even the levels!!!<br>  what i suggest is now that you put the lvl in your sources and there moves.<br>  then we can rate them.<br>  this is terrible no one can rate this.<br>  fix it up and ill rate it in my sources
FVRDpmCXaa	Beat the Elite Four and then collect/see 150 pokemon and go to Professor Rowan. He gives a poke radar to you. Then Professor Oak comes in and upgrades your Pokedex to national mod. Then he goes to pal park. Go to pal park and talk to Oak the the guy at the both and save and turn off power. INtrest emrald ruby saphire fire red or leaf green. And turn on power. Then it says migrate pokemon. Click it and chose the ones you want to migrate (can't be migrated if it knows hm moves). And the talk to the guy again and he lets you in and then you have to catch the pokemon you migrated. It's easy.|`|dSR5x0cjaa	Will O put it perfectly and once you to go to pal park dont worry about not catching the pokemon becuase the park balls are like master balls they will catch every pokemon

a37024000cf1621ee33d4f7d82376058aa	It is hard to get free game. maybe you wanna try to purchase at $6.99 only instead of $19.99<br>  Check out this website <a href="http://www.mygamespace.com/sarahlim" rel="nofollow">http://www.mygamespace.com/sarahlim</a>|`|uiZhcqqSaa	sorry, i looked all over the net(i think) you will have to pay for vitual villagers or download a trial for free.|`|ePNoC11daa	No, i had to buy kindergarten for my sister i couldnt get it for free. its impossible unless you download those dodgy sites which i wouldnt do!!
JCQ0Dhywaa	after you eat the elite four go to the seventh island once you unlock it and go all the way till you reach the southern tip there should be like two small pathes of grass with a sign in the area look through the grass they are rare so don't expect it to pop up fast you can also find skarmory there too....|`|TiP0gsRwaa	Yes you can i  think its on 4 island in the mountains|`|30df7c325ae8f7474ce61c26a63fc215aa	Island 4 when u first get there go west there's a bridge that takes you down to this grassy area and Larvitar comes out very rarely around this area and I believe u can also catch Skarmory and theres a little puzzle in this cave down if u have a Pokemon with strength.|`|IQN30cJFaa	yes

o5y19Bikaa	The best would be Hoenn and Kanto...cuz the pokemon there are sooooo cute and strong.....while the worst shud be Sinnoh....i dun like it cuz the pokemon look so ugly or fierce...and they make evolutions for sum pokemon which have alredi evolved.....ex===Rhydon and Porygon...hoped it help|`|30df7c325ae8f7474ce61c26a63fc215aa	Johto was by far the best 3 new starters the beastliest Legendary Trio, and of course my 2 fav pokemon Lugia and Tyrannitar, I also liked beating on all the old trainers like BLUE and RED and Lance from the Originals  the day to night system was pretty sweet as well. Kanto would have to be 2nd because its the original and I loved my homeboys Charizard and Dragonite from that first set it was also in Kanto where I got my Mew (from a Nintendo Event ) ,Hoehn brought some new aspects like Diving underwater to catch pokemon and hade a lot of Dragons I'm Suprised Lance and his Sister didn't try to tag team me there for beating them so long ago<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sinnoh well I haven't played that game mostly because of the fact I don't have a DS but I'm sure it would take the 2nd or 3rd spot since it has the day to night system and I believe I heard it lets you catch old pokemon in Pal Park similar to the safari zone|`|5KYpQ2lPaa	WORST:Sinnoh, or maybe the next generation...because the new ones are really getting worse...for obvious reasons!<br>  <br>  BEST:Johto, one word-Lugia...<br>  <br>  ...and maybe the rest of them pokes too but this generation was the first sequel and it had both Kanto and Johto(separated by an unusually tiny river)and for me personally this generation introduced me to the Pokemon series.|`|TEWtR8O3aa	haha was i the inspiration of this question from my answer to your previous question?? haha<br>  <br>  n to be honest i dont no wot one was kanta, wot was johto  n so on . . . so wotever one had the sick turtle with water cannons . . . haha mad lookin thing|`|VbtuGsYWaa	um the region firered/leafgreen are in to me are the best! Why simple: more challenges(getting the gems to trade to diff regions) Legendary birds + Dogs(i think)<br>  Worst: Hoenn Why: no challenges  there. Beat elite 4 catch rarequza and regis they wont a challenge. Pokemon in hoenn are easier to lvl then pokemon in sinnoh. On both ive been play for 80hours. my starter was lvl 76 in hoenn and 58 in sinnoh. So training pokemon wasnt a hard chellenge.|`|jeFIY5JFaa	I like sinnon and johto because of the pre evolvtion and future evolutions hoenn to me was pointless kanto is okay|`|Y9MFV2LKaa	the best is sinnoh because i like the idea of further evolutions although they should have one for things like pinsir and tauros. also piplup is the cutest pokemon ever and i like the baby pokemon because they are funny. hoenn  is the worst because they all look like robots and aliens not pokemon|`|myhRKq0Gaa	i would say johto as it was the first sequel and introduced the first new batch of pokemon so everyone was very excited. also the pokemon were very kool.<br>  <br>  in hoenn, the pokemon started becoming weird such as loudred and stuff who looked so alien and also mawile and stuff<br>  <br>  sinnoh didnt really much new pokemon but mainly evolutions of them <br>  <br>  so overall probably johto best and hoenn worst
30df7c325ae8f7474ce61c26a63fc215aa	ight depending on lvl I assume your having the same trouble I did a few days ago in Fire Red, well If your Pokemon are in the lvl 60 or above area then Cerulean Cave and the Elite Four are where it's at but if there in the lv 40- 55 range I'd say Victory Road, then the Sevii Islands other then that there is no where good to train in my opinion ,ohh and Trainer Tower gives you the Item Upgrade the first time through it but if You've gone to The Rocket Hideout on the Sevii islands and picked it up there then it's pretty much just something to do  because you get no Exp.|`|NawOgfuFaa	elite four<br>  <br>  and you don't get any benifits|`|jeFIY5JFaa	Eltie four or the ceruerlan cave where you get mewtwo the only benefit you get the trainer is get items to evolve th traded pokemon like porygon 2
sgRDJUXqaa	It's because of the graphics card on the computer.  It would require a new graphics card in order to operate properly.    Whenever you see system requirements, it usually helps to double them.  Those are the bare minimum, and they almost always create problems if that's all you have.|`|XOOL3CjAaa	I think you need to buy a new one   sorry|`|9CLRMnhSaa	You may have to delete stuff or get a Video drive!!!!!   Cost 80.00$ or less!    Or bring it to a computer fixing place!!  Show it to them!    Most likley it is scratched!!  Tell your parents to clean it for u!    Mine did that!  It was a virus on the game and the computer!  My homes whenever I entered them, the would go boom!  a fire or just gone!|`|G6ZCpYwYaa	Sounds like you need to upgrade your graphics card.    If your not sure how to upgrade, post your computer specs on a forum for help, or go to a pc repair shop (as said above).    Hope this helps :)
tL9SuAWbaa	I would have to say go with left 4 dead.|`|G6ZCpYwYaa	Left 4 dead definitely.    Such an awesome game, deserves a lot more credit than it gets.    great for co-op and online too.|`|eIuJ6IGIaa	Left 4 dead by far for me.|`|UBSaJ7xzaa	l4d every time its rox the sox beleive me you will never consider skate 2 again once u have l4d  unless u dont like shooting 100s fo zombies i  which case ur a freak|`|HglK3s09aa	skate 2...i have played both and skate 2 tops L4D for me.  skate 2 has all new features, skaters, skate parks etc and the graphics and physics of the game have been greatly improved :D
lP2dN2U9aa	Ouch, well this is a longshot, but try opening the door with a lockpick, and then closing the door he needs to walk out of to get out of the dungeon.    the reason im saying close the 2nd door is because once i opened his cell door, he walked out, closed the 2nd door which was open (perhaps meaning to open it) and just stayed there.|`|Kqpqt69Vaa	im not sure but you may have to shut all the doors in the prison and see if that works or if you have a save from before you bugged the game try using that.i don't know what else to try sorry.good luck great game.
gl2eLkixaa	If you placed your bet with one of the major high street bookies they will pay you out and count the 4th match as a non runner, you won't win as much as you would have done when it was played but will certainly be in profit. If you want to check how much use Corals bet calculator and put the odds in off the 4 teams then select non runner for the one which didn't play and enter your stake at the bottom and it will work it out for you.|`|u2slnVCoaa	Some bookies in this situation pay for the 3 picks you win and the other they simply ignore it. Others void the bet and you receive your money. You should ask for that them.|`|yJ3GpnXAaa	As in the reply above, you need to get a result from all four teams.    If one match was postponed, you'll probably find that the bet is void (ie, you get your stake back), but check with your own bookie.|`|d5db3d65335d76da96ef60e1bff25654aa	Check with your bookie on the ruling on postponed matches - but I would expect no pay out as the 4th team didn't win. An accumulator is for getting all the results right - not just some of them.|`|Nc0mxdY5aa	If the postponed game is not played within 48hrs the bookmaker WILL payout.    You will get paid on the 3 teams that won.    Was this an online bet ? - if so check your history / bet slip & you should see that the result for the postponed game is VOID.
MXDjKRPOaa	i would use a spellcasters deck with dark paladin in it. As this monster gains 500 atk points for every dragon monster.........i would also throw in some cards like:  dragon capture jar  dragon piper  etc.    And don't forget that spellcasters are very powerful if used correctly, so brush up on some gd combos two!! good luck.....|`|mHWsuqjZaa	well it sounds like you are the one that sucks if yu friend "sucks" and he is beating you. How is it a bunch of bull to use cards that he has? anyway; dragon caputer jar, buster blader, sword of dragon's soul, dragon piper,and alot of warrior monsters should do the trick.|`|9cdd17efd12ec1369c460bc024c5a88aaa	You can make any deck u want just put a few dragon prevention cards in it like dragon capture jar, spellbinding circle, swords of revealing light,  lightning vortex, stuff like that. I would probably get a warrior deck to counter and just get some dragon stomping cards to stop his dragons. Cause he has a dragon deck all u need is dragon capture jar and you're good for the whole duel unless he has a harpies feather duster or mystical space typhoon. Buster Blader is a good monster too cause it's a wrrior and it gets 300 ATK for every dragon on your opponents side of the field. Marauding captian is a good card cause while it is on the field, no warrior type monsters can be attacked so that stops his assault before it even starts!|`|wr5upsNKaa	well the best deck to face a dragon deck is a more powerful dragon deck
U6rCN4R8aa	OMG.  if you have live we should most deff. play together!!  BFFFLZ.|`|nPlONqnPaa	you should try beating single player on COD5 on higher difficulties. it gets really hard and it helps you strategically and how to work with your team. Also, try experimenting with different, less powerful, more accurate weapons, it helps. Watch people play on youtube.     In madden, all i can say is play alot.|`|9BPDE0TBaa	have you looked for a "cheats" website on yahoo?
ul5hiJfbaa	"It's possible. They are not talking about it at the moment but nothing has been decided as of yet."   This is from a interview with the team making Guitar Hero: Metallica.    But I think it is likely so they can earn more money.|`|4swxcu6maa	Apparently gamespot claim that there will be a double bass made for the game.
U6rCN4R8aa	i like wow.|`|piCOVRC6aa	virginity|`|O2HJjOZwaa	look at there sites they always have jobs|`|FfCpx6mLaa	Computer Science degree, Microsoft A+ certification, and years of experience in computer programming...  that would all be a good start.|`|plZFYzlZaa	Well, by 'level designer' I'm guessing you'll want to learn map making.     Big corporations such as require heavy use of 3-D editors such as Maya and Blender.    Photoshop expertise for texturing and skinning is highly sought after, as well as animating and scripting.     The corporation websites usually have requirements listed for fulfilling their jobs.     There are plenty up and coming schools and colleges nowadays that offer game designing classes that'll get you right into the network as soon as you graduate.
lP2dN2U9aa	Your spelling is terrible, as is your knowledge of computers.    the registration code is different for everyone, there are billions of codes, only one will work on yours, and wont work for anyone else.|`|plZFYzlZaa	I won't partake in illegal warez and/or torrents on a public media.|`|ybmVlgYhaa	here try this one 44Z9-4ECA-X9K5-6KUY-KE9J    GOOD LUCK
8GQq2wiaaa	It took a while for me to beat the Elite Four the first time too. My party pokemon were around level 45/50 at best.    What I ended up doing was catching Moltres and Zapdos (Both are at level 50 in the wild) and that helped a LOT. Teach Zapdos Thunder or Thunderbolt (You can buy it at the Celadon game corner) and that will make Lorelei a lot easier. Once you get past her, just use a very strong psychic type for Bruno and Agatha.    Even after I did that, it still took me at least 7 or 8 times to get past them, since I wasn't using any revives.  Here's my party that I used:  Blastoise  Raichu  Kadabra  Moltres  Zapdos  Nidoking|`|BVhX9CKJaa	Train them all equaly.  get 1 of the types so you can match them up.  the elite 4:  Loreli, ice and water, (use fire or electric)    Bruno, rock and fighting ( ice or steel)    Agatha, ghost( idk)    Lance, dragon ( water or ghost (i think))    train them all to at least  LV.75.    Good Leaf Green Elite Four Team    charizard lvl 70  fly  blast burn  flamethrower  dragon rage    clefairy lvl 55  psychic  water pulse  meteor mash  metronome    butterfree lvl 55  silverwind  gust  psybeam  sleep powder    gyarados lvl 55  hydropump  dragon rage  surf  bite    primape lvl 55  karate chop  low kick  crosschop  strength    pidgeot lvl 55  fly  quick attack  agility  wing attack    i hoped i helped... erm, do you know whats after the elite 4 battles...  if you don't then its ba surprize at the end. just gd luck =)|`|bVvZ2fSzaa	Put any pokemon in the daycare and find a mud slide. if you can't find any, then just go to a wall. Then take a small lego piece and tape it onto the arrow that youre facing the wall and you will just keep walking. Keep the gameboy or ds charged, turn off the sound and light and leave it there. I did this once and my espeon grew to lvl. 64 in 18 hours from a lvl 41. lol|`|p4H61jQDaa	just think about what you said and go home and rethink your life|`|24U1VZKqaa	wow......POKEMON?
P4wi8fqlaa	You could sign up to Runescape, there are loads of people you can talk to online and you don't have to buy any items with real money and there are loads of fun events and stuff.|`|Achu07zLaa	http://www.edgearcade.com/games?id=1&ref...      you mite like it|`|gG2CuoF8aa	habbo. :)|`|xTxfmGxDaa	well if your really into that type of stuff then try...zwinky  random name but its like club penguin|`|JewSZpkHaa	habbo yeah lol, or second life, but u have to download that (: x|`|RbtjwnQTaa	The best in that whole genre of games is Runescape, however most of the games in that genre aren't too good to begin with. If you want GOOD games, you'll want to look into downloadable MMO's.|`|9CdZylu9aa	Yes there are few I know: Habbo, Second Life, Runescape,Meetoto.   If you want a Adult fantasy kind: Red Light Center.    www.redlightcenter.com
mKPQTvHnaa	oblivion is good if your into that sort of thing, if not, try overlord. you hardly have to do much in that game (you get your minions to do it for you) hope i helped!|`|2fqXT9W6aa	I broke my arm recently too, annoying when you're trying to play something.    Anyway, most games that use the controller would be quite hard. You could try a singing game e.g. Lips or you could sing/play the drums on Guitar Hero: World Tour.|`|O2HJjOZwaa	bro any racing game stay away from shooters just tell your mom to hide them so it doesnt haunt u|`|josOoA32aa	GTA:IV. But if you crash, you're screwed XD|`|PmoPN0ffaa	Bejing Olmpic Games     lol.  O.J     ermmmm...   Try Arcade games   cause there is nothing that u can do with a broken arm   Soz  m8  gd luck lol.
uctxzjIIaa	Nope. If you run from battle, the only things you can keep are stolen/morphed items. Limit usage totals are tallied with XP and AP.|`|gUr8xMskaa	I think you have to finish the battle, because at the end, your score gets tallied up, and the end screen is the same screen that you level up in.
76syBu52aa	Turn on the light??? - I give, what do you do.|`|F48RJ0E2aa	you stop cheating and figure it out :)|`|ksEx63mFaa	umm. if your talking about super smash brother keep attacking the top left corner of the box it will break!
iqIhTJCSaa	You're supposed to teach it how to speak I believe.

So jealous you have one, lol. :P<br>  <br>  If you put your hands over it's eyes, it goes to sleep.|`|EO145XSDaa	you can play games with original furby too. it also can interact with shelby, gizmo, original furby babies etc. i dont know if it can interact with teh new furbies though. :]]
