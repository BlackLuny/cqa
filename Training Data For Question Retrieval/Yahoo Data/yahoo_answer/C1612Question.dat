20090222193249AAITrK0	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Is it a good idea to live in an RV?	So, here's my situation.  I graduated college back in April of 2008 and moved back in with my parents in August of 2008.  I've yet to find a job in my field (or really any full-time job for that matter) and have been working part-time to save up money while I'm here.      However, I'm a firm believer in being independent and the longest I will live with my parents is 1 year (which would be August 2009).  Even if I don't have a fulltime job by that point, I'm 95% sure that I can transfer within the company I'm working part-time at now to another city (it's a common retail store and I've known several people who have transfered with no problems).        So, basically, I'm searching for cheap means of living and I found myself thinking about RVs.  The concept of paying no rent really does sound appealing.  I'm definitely a minimalist and very unmaterialistic so I dont feel I would need a lot of space.  I've looked now and again on craigslist and have found some for a few thousand dollars that actually look pretty decent.      Does anyone have any experiences living in an RV?  Are there any major downfalls to it besides the lack of space that you would get in an apartment or fear of being called 'trailer trash.'  Would anybody strongly recommend it over apartment living?      Thanks in advance for your help!

20090222160320AA93mtr	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Israel	Misunderstandings about apartheid?	lived in SA until I was about 12 years old (till 1996). It didn't seem to be a violent place where I lived (although the country was supposedly in an uproar). Here's my question: The world seems to think that apartheid was a simple matter of Afrikaners dominating blacks because they derived a sick joy out of it. And I think part of the justification for apartheid was simple racism. But I've come to the conclusion that Afrikaners actually believed their culture faced extinction if they did not take drastic measures to protect it. And furthermore, I think it was about culture as much as it was about race... to the point that if you had money you were viewed as white (contrast the treatment of Japanese and Chinese people in apartheid SA). There was even a commission that decided whether you were white or black based on, among other things, your habits and the "way you carried yourself." This is especially relevant to the Israel-Palestine conflict where people seem to now argue that it's OK to discriminate as long as it's not based on skin color. Jewish South African authors have written whole books trying to clear the majority of Jews living under apartheid from the accusations leveled at them. But then prominent Jewish anti-apartheid activists (meaning not Jews who were trying to make other Jews feel better) in SA denied that they were given support by the Jewish community for protesting apartheid and wrote "Declaration of conscience on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by South Africans of Jewish descent." But I digress. So, was it only about racial domination, or about protecting cultural identity as well? If it was only racism, what are the psychological/political reasons for this racism? Do you believe that as an Afrikaner I am an evil person? Even when you hear I voted for Obama, I recycle, I return my library books on time, I'm pro civil-rights.. etc.? I've come to believe that a lot of **** I get from people is because they view me as an Afrikaner and not as an individual... I don't fit the Afrikaner mold anyway.

20090222173745AASK5Yw	Travel;Europe (Continental);Turkey	What do you think of my lying Turkish ex bf?	I must apologise firstly, I know I shd have posted this qn to the Single & Dating section but honestly I do not want to get advise of 14-15 yr olds.      I recently found out my newly ex bf has lied to me for the second time about his smoking. We've broken up a month after 3 years of long distance rship has taken a toll- too much fighting and work stress. However we are open to the possibility of us getting together again esp as I am heading to Istanbul later this year.      A year ago I wanted us to quit smoking as I was thinking of health measures. We are both in late 20s and I do want a healthy lifestyle and if we were to get married, I envision us waking up to healthy bfast and orange juice and a jog in the park. HEALTHY lifestyle lol. If we are to be parents, I do not wish for us to be sick and coughing due to ciggies.      We tried and tried and we succeeded in quitting. So I thought. The truth is I succeeded but he smoked again after a month but he lied to me throughout saying he has quitted. I admit it was EXTREMELY hard, I was a smoker for 6 years before I call it quits and he is a smoker for nearly 12-13 yrs now. I caught him lying and go berserk cos I really hate liars.       He told me he was so sorry but it was so hard for him and he didnt wanna tell me in case I get discouraged in quitting. He was also hoping by lying it spur him to quit soon as he wldnt wanna keep on lying.      After a very long time I forgave him.       Two days ago I found out he started smoking again 2 mths ago though he led me to believe he was 'clean'. (Since we broke up a month ago, it shows he s still lying when we were together). He has been in depression coz of the economic crisis there and he has not been paid for 2-3 months by his company. His dad has been calling him useless and he hints to me life seems meaningless to him.       Sigh. I do not know what to say now. I understand he s depressed. He s far from useless as far as Im concerned. He s hard working and very clever, but it seems every company he worked for has not been kind and fair to their staff.      I think my thoughts of us getting back together pretty much diminish this time. He was very upset when I told him that. I just cant accept a liar. The issue is not about him smoking again its about him LYING.      Am I fair to think so? On the other hand, I might as well confess that I did have 2 ciggies months ago whilst I was on vacation w my gf. I was very mad and riled up at that time as I ran into trouble with a local there and not even the police wanna help me. And yes I didnt tell him that cos I didnt want him to return back to the bad habit. I didnt continue my habits though cos between us Im more determine to kick the habit.      Geez sorry for long post. Am I fair to judge him on his smoking lies? Other than this, he has been really wonderful and sweet. He s opposite of me in a way - he s more reserved and quiet and hardly likes partying. A decent chap.      Whats your take in this matter? I sincerely apologise again for the long post.

20090222190303AAtK1Qf	Travel;United States;New Orleans	Some assistance please? Mardi Gras?	As of April of last year, I moved to New Orleans. Its my first Mardi Gras.      I can say that, though I've enjoyed it, I've had a bit of frustration.      I'm not much of one for drinking, and the parades are what I was really looking forward to.      The problem is that I'm very short and people are total jerks. I barely caught anything at Endymion because the three cigarette smoking women who wouldn't even allow their little children to stand on the ladders they brought caught absolutely everything, right to the point of snatching it from peoples hands. And you couldn't see anything because those three were standing in the way.      I almost went up to one great big wench and punched her in the face for how rude she was being right down to the condescension dripping from her.      Even her husband was disgusted with her behavior and handed me a set of beads before I left.      I want to enjoy the parades on Tuesday, I really do, but after that I'm a little turned off.      So next year I want to come prepared.      My husband and I talked about getting tickets to the stands that line the streets.      There are alot of stands that line the streets but the problem seems to be that I can't find any of them online (well... I found one) so that we can buy advanced tickets.      Does anyone have links to those websites? Thank you.

20090222182444AAUCsaF	Travel;United Kingdom;Other - United Kingdom	Uk people pls help me??????????????????	I am a fashion designing undergraduate. We have to do a graduation fashion show for our final year. I hope to do a woman's wear collection for Autumn and winter 2010. The Troy movie (ancient Greek warriors, Greek architecture, Greek culture) was selected as my inspiration source.      I want to express very masculine, outstanding, independent look through my collection and also I want to do an innovative collection with more structural looks. I think the Brand, Gareth Pugh is more appropriate for my collection. Now I am searching about customers of the Gareth Pugh brand as I have to do a product strategy report for the brand.The Gap of the brand is most essential for the report. When the Gap of Gareth Pugh Brand is considered, lack of designer level product ranges is a major issue as he mainly focus on Luxury market with high price levels. Another main issue is Ethical fashion. He mostly use synthetic fabrics, so I am going to introduce recyclable PVC materials.      This was a brief of my collection. But, I couldn't find a better customer for my collection. It will be better if she is outstanding, masculine woman in UK with a higher income level, who interests on Gareth Pugh's brand. If anyone can help me to find a good customer profile (I need only her details and she won't need to buy anything) for my project and sources to find more about Gareth Pugh brand. Further more, any comment on my collection and your ideas to improve it, are highly appreciated.

20090222204715AAmDvoJ	Travel;Canada;Other - Canada	Can I plant a maple tree in Canada (I'll explain why)?	I don't want to keep my savings in currency because I fear inflation.  I don't want to buy Gold because I fear there is tons more Gold on Mars, making precious metals less rare than they are valued now.        I don't want to invest in stocks or bonds because I don't trust corporations or the faith and credit of governments these days, eh      Buying books will help to an extent, but there becomes wear and tear and also when the economy is in dire straits the price of books drops reverse to inflation.       If I buy real estate, it may become worthless if one day people live in space and there's no demand for land on earth.      BUT....if I plant a maple tree in Canada.  Then 40 years I watch it grow and then MAPLE SYRUP every spring forever.....and there we have it, I sell the maple syrup for a living into my retirement :)

20090222213555AA81jQg	Travel;United States;Atlanta	Might be going to Atlanta in June, can't really afford hotel...?	My husband and I would love to attend an education conference in Atlanta over a weekend in June but the conference is going to be just under $1,000 for the both of us to attend - not including travel and accomodations.  We will more than likely be traveling by bus (the cheapest option so far) but have no idea what to do about accomodations.  Is there any website or organization that matches travelers with local families who might rent a guest room out for cheaper than a hotel?  Our meals are included in the conference.  I thought about Home Exchange but #1: No one would ever vacation in the small town in east Texas where we live and #2: We rent a tiny apartment nowhere equivalent to what's on offer on HomeExchange.      We're new teachers, we do not make hardly any money, but we'd really love to attend this conference to become better teachers.  Anyone have any good ideas?      The Atlanta Hostel is actually a bit more expensive than most other hostels I've stayed in and has received horrible reviews.  And the YMCA in Atlanta only rents rooms to men.        Thanks for any suggestions!

I've heard there are other ways to get flights cheaper once you get inside Chile. Does anyone have any suggestions on getting cheaper airfare there?
