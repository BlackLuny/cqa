Our house is always dry - it has a relative humidity dial on the top floor with something in the ceiling that turns on.  I have it set at 20%, but our house is always dry where you get static everywhere and shocks when you touch stuff.  Am I setting this right?  How does it work?  Does it use moist air, does it usually have other vents in the house?      It is our first house, so I have know idea what all this stuff is - there are random large vents/grates in the living room and stairway going downstairs to the basement.  Anyone have any idea what this is for?      It is a 3 level 5 year old townhouse.

20090226111156AAvtHUv	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Using USA Electrical lights in the UK.?	Hi       I recently went to the US and bought 20 packs of "Mini Light Sets" from Walmart; there are 100 mini lights in each - they are usually used as Xmas lights.      You can connect all 20 together if you so wished - that was one of the reasons I bought them since I would like to use them to decorate the house when my sister gets married.      Here's the question. I would like to connect, at most, 10 at once; maybe 5.. I don't know. But I don't know whether I can use just a normal plug converter, or whether I have to buy a step down transformer. Will the UK electricity be able to take at 5 (ish) at once?      I know electricity in the UK is more powerful than the US so will I be okay just to use a normal plug converter?      The info on the lights is:      120V 60Hz AC.      I hope somebody can help me. Thanks.

20090226153537AAiQYJg	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Overwhelmed with clutter?	First of all let me begin by saying my situation is one of great fortune... When my husband and I first moved in together 2 years ago we got a great one bedroom apartment. I was relieved and happy to be out of my mothers (extensive pack rat) home, and into a new fresh clean space. I was in nursing school full time then, and shortly after the move my now husband proposed to me. Very tragically my very healthy 70 year old grandfather suffered a heart attack and died just a few short months later.... We were left the home in a gracious act by him... a home he and my grandmother had lived in since the early 80s, but was filled with a lifetime of various items. Our move in was very stressful as I was in school, and then even after graduation was hurridly looking for employment to work a few short months before our marriage. Needless to say we've been in the house going on two years, and even though we've had multiple garage sales I find myself absolutely overwhelmed with clutter, and items that belonged to my grandparents. While I did very well in the early stages, somethings are really hard to part with.. I have drawers full of (very silly I know!) cards they gave each other over the years, and totes full of meangingful knick knacks, but our house is not that big, and we are beginning to run out of room!... I just feel so frusterated with it at times... I will begin to work on it and throw my hands up in the air a half hour later when I realize I have no idea what to do with anything...Any advice???

20090226164218AAq0f71	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	How to remove ceramic tile from cement backer board?	I used a hammer to break one of the ceramic tile to see what's under it in the kitchen and it appears to be some kind of cardboard paper that rips up when I get underneath it.       Question #1: I'm assuming this is cement backer board?       Question #2: Is there an easy way to pop off these ceramic tiles from the cement backer board?       I was thinking of getting a 3lb sledge hammer and chisel but then I read that other people are using air chisel.        Question #3: Am I to assume with either approach, if I get at an angle with the ceramic tile, with enough force, it should just pop off as a whole tile?      If so, this is a lot quicker than hammering away since using a hammer just breaks it away in smaller pieces.        Ultimately, I would like to get the cement backer board off as well and get to the subfloor to install engineered hardfloors.      Question #4: I'm assuming I can use a flat shovel and get underneath the cement backer board and it should just rip up.  Is this good practice?      Please copy and paste Questions #1-4 and respond.  Whoever answers first in this format will get best answer.      Thanks,   John
