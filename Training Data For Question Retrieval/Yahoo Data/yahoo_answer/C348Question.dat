20090128132047AAGR9p1	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	A change in the Duggars' life?	Okay so my thoughts lately have been obsessing over the Duggars.  Last night I had some family over and we were watching the Duggars together (again) and we actually had an on-going debate about them.        Now, don't you think they would do much better in life if they were a little bit more lenient with their rules.  Of course I agree with their belief in God and teaching their kids respect, but they definitely take it over board.  I am a HUGE, strong believer of God, but I do not pray for weeks to him about every single decision in my life.  If they need to buy shoes; they pray to God for a week to see if it's the "right decision."  These kids need to make some little mistakes and get hurt a few times in order to actually believe in God (rather then just believe what their parents are saying about him).  They need to date (not sleep with) but date people and get hurt once or twice to appreciate love and commitment more.  They just shelter their kids too much that they're hurting them.      Sure, everyone seems happy, but will they be this happy in a few years when they realize they have very little education and no experience in the real world.  In their book, as I heard, they prefer that the girls are stay at home moms, and the boys do small 'odd' businesses.  What?  I'm not sure if it's just me, but I would encourage my kids to get the highest degree of education as they'd like.      Now don't get me wrong, I like the Duggars as much as the next guy, but there are some things I feel if they changed they'd be doing better for their kids.  I'd love the put some jeans on those girls, take them to the movies to watch a PG movie (at least the oldest ones), let them watch some TV.  They can still go to church, and pray every single day, I would actually enforce it.  But have fun.  God wants you to question him, and wonder, not always obey, obey, obey.  You never learn that way.      What do you think?

It seems like there are millions of people out there who hate Mobb Deep simply because Tupac dissed them. Am I the only one out there who thinks this way? Call me crazy but I will take "The Infamous" and "Hell on Earth" over any Pac album any day (although i haven't heard much of "Me Against The World", which i hear is his best album). Don't get me wrong I am a Pac fan, I think he has some of hip hops greatest songs (Dear Mama, and "Keep Ya Head Up") but I don't find myself actually listening to many of his albums all the way through.      So my question is... If Pac wouldn't have ever dissed Mobb Deep in the first place would more people look back to the 90's and think of them as the one's who came up with classics like "Shook Ones pt. II" and "Survival of the Fittest"?      Or would psycho Pac stans still find a reason to hate?      One more question... Exactly why did Pac decide to diss Mobb Deep? I understand the whole Pac vs. Biggie. But I don't know the background story on why he decided to diss the Mobb.

Do you think Sun really does blame Kate for Jins death......she said she doesn't but in an earlier episode she told her father that two people were responsible for Jins death and he was one of them......I'm thinking Kate is the other person (though Jack made a comment in the season finale that Sun blames him)      Do you think Sun is behind the court ordered blood test on Kate and Aaron?      What are the chances that Jin is still alive?         Also does anyone think that the island represents EDEN......I ask because that is a common theory.

I want something that will make everyone say "Woah, how the freak did you get that", that isn't drugs. I wanna start a trend. What should I buy that's anywhere up to $100?      PS- Please don't lecture me on saving my money, I'm probably not gonna get it anyway. It's just a poll, yo.

20090128140352AAKYS8M	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Can "real" hip hop purists just button it already ? ...?	Dont get me wrong, I like underground hip hop and most of the classic stuff more than most of today's commercial output. .. But it's now gotten to the point where every comment on a commercial hip hop video is "F*** 50 Cent,Soulja Boy and Lil Wayne" etc etc.. - everyone's heard it all already- so why are these so-called purists just as arrogant as the people who listen to commercial rap ?      I've also noticed that some of these guys who comment can also be kids as young as 14 who obviously were never mature enough yet to appreciate fully the early 90's music scenes, so what gives them every right to bash and curse over commercial rap ? And then you have the same comments over and over again by random people in regards to what constitutes "real" hip hop, or words like "no more of this blingy, hoe type ****" etc. .... Enough already!

Now my question is has anybody ever heard that before and if you haven't then can somebody tell how to go about looking for it.

There, I said it. I, Bradley Louise Turner put on an act. Everyone thinks I’m so wild and crazy but really I’m just the opposite. It’s not like I’m fake or anything. I do say the truth and nothing but. It’s just…sometimes I wish I was different. The reason I act the way I do is because I want to be liked and I guess my act worked. I am liked but this isn’t the “real” me. The real me doesn’t like love-stories or staying out until three in the morning partying. The real me would rather stay inside and watch a horror movie with a close group of friends and then play truth or dare and go to bed. The real me doesn’t like wearing designer jeans every day and having to go to the bathroom three times a day in school just to make sure my makeup looks flawless. The real me doesn’t mind wearing sweatpants and baggy t-shirts. Of course I would never tell them. Who’s them? Oh, just the Aphrodite girls. Yep, the Aphrodite girls. That’s their group name and I am part of them.

20090128143443AAb1krd	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Name the Movie!  (10 POINTS)?	Here are some clues      *The film won the Silver Scream Award in 2002   *The lead actor was in Brokeback Mountain    *One quote from that movie is (this should give it away)  "First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create Smurfette. Gargamel did. She was sent in as Gargamel's evil spy with the intention of destroying the Smurf village. But the overwhelming goodness of the Smurf way of life transformed her. And as for the whole gang-bang scenario, it just couldn't happen. Smurfs are asexual. They don't even have... reproductive organs under those little, white pants. It's just so illogical, you know, about being a Smurf. You know, what's the point of living... if you don't have a dick?"

On their Flickr albums and crap like that, they post pictures of themselves sticking out their tongue and crossing their eyes and being like "I'm so hot" or "aren't I pretty" when in reality they're BUTT UGLY.      And on those surveys and stuff like that, those things that people post, the question would be "do you think that you're attractive?" and they'd be like "yeah, I'm the prettiest person in my class"      Why can't people be humble for once?

20090128092001AASuea2	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Events in the 80's...Hard rock!?	Ok I am doing a paper for English 102. I have to pick a decade then pick a person, event, and trend from that decade and write an essay on it. My "person" is Def Leppard my trend is hard rock but i'm having trouble finding an event in the 80's to flow with this. They all 3 need to connect. It doesn't have to be an event of Def Leppard but I do want the event to have something to do with rock.    My mom suggested my event be the We Are The World benefit concert where a bunch of artists sang this and at the time people just went nuts over it. Until I heard that was Micheal Jacksons song and I would rather slit my wrist then write about that rapist. Any suggestions on a major rock event or something that happened here? I wish something went on like the 1969 Woodstock festival and concert.

I have seen many a preview for the newest films and they seem to be run-of-the-mill and a bit lame, to be honest.       In the entertainment industry, it's as if the same crap is being regurgitated.         In my opinion, this especially rings true for movies of the horror genre.      Is this a simple reflection of us, the consumers?

I'm talking about ones that have no harm, no intent, nothing except it may be considered a chat but it was one answer not multiple ones so even that as an answer it cannot be considered such. My point is are these people so powerless that they must try to ruin everyone else's good time? did they not play well with others when they were growing up? are they powerless in their current lives and need to attack others viciously to get that feeling that is festering up inside of them out. Why would anyone want to even be one of these types? Everyone knows those types aren't liked. right?

20090128144149AANbkCc	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	America-WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO YOU?	We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — *****That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.********Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.       http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=JmHmrJlD3e...

I watch the world   Spin by me   Darkness creeping in   Casting shadows   Kids listening to iPods   Do they feel?   The hurt that I do?   Each cut bleeding wide open   How much are suffering in me?   Please, why can't I see?      Just like a cut on a hand   Heals   So will a wound on the   Heart   In this dance that   You   Have prepared for me      Each road   And bend I see   Brings tears and pain to me   Let this curse be gone   Each thought that brings me back   To those thoughts of the past   Too strong to escape   I can't escape from those memories   But      (chorus)      Bridge:      Jesus   Help me cross this bridge   Let me hear Your Music   Catch me in Your Arms   Lead me through these tears   Help me past these years   Oh, Lord, bring me here      (chorus)      what do you think? do you think it would sound nice with music?(have no music writing talent whatsoever.)

There's this "Are YOU Interested?" application on Facebook. There's this part on it where a person from your friends list pops up and there's a question asking "Are you interested?". You either click, "Yes (As A Friend)", "Yes (Let Them Know)", or "Skip".      Well there's this guy on my friends list who goes to my high school. He's in grade 11 and I'm in grade 10.

On this application on Facebook, his profile just popped up. I'm having a debate with myself, as to whether or not I should click, "Yes (Let Them Know)". I've let 4 other guys in the past know that I think they're cute/have a crush on them but each of them rejected me, so that's basically what's discouraging me.      What should I do?

20090128105253AALF89J	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Why do things from 1989 seem so much more dated than things from 1991?	Anyone else notice this?

This is pretty weird - WHY? 1991 wasn't that much more high tech than 1989.

20090225085713AAEgLKH	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	What's wrong with Marvel and DC comics these days...?	What's wrong with Marvel and DC:   Here is what I don't like, that I can think of right now anyway...        I guess there will always be the problem of trying to explain why after 50 years Batman is still in his early 30's.  I hear they are making Batman a New God to take care of the problem.         I don't like the new Blue Beetle either. Poor Ted Kord.  Wonder Woman is now a murderer too.        I don't like seeing the characters change as much as they have.  Some things I don't mind but it seems like when they are going to veer off the path, Man do they!       Parallax.     Death and rebirth of Jolt of the Thunderbolts   Superman with long hair and an attitude    All the different lanterns of various colors (this one I feel a little indifferent about, but when you look back at the history, OA was supposedly the center of everything.)     Oh, speaking of OA I don't care for the female Guardians of the Universe who were never there before.    Multiple Monitors.   Identity Crisis (you knew at the end Atom's wife would be back as a villain) and the loss of Sue was huge.  Plus the mind wiping stuff.  Heck Marvel did it to the entire Univers and no one minded.   Spidey taking off his mask, then when Marvel realizes they screwed up royally, makes a deal with the Devil (Mephisopholese) to make everyone forget but he and Mary Jane are no more.   Infinite Crisis (How do you change reality...oh that's right hit a wall over and over.)   Superboy goes insane.   Bringing Back Barry Allen, (who died a hero to save the mult-verse) and Hal Jordan   The Initiative.   Iron Man hunts down and puts in jail any other hero who doesn't go along with the Keene act, I mean the Mutant registration act,...I mean the Superhuman Registration Act.  Because after all it's the law.  After the Skrull invasion, Iron Man is blamed because his Stark industries technology failed as the invasion began.  Iron Man became an outlaw and was told to give up since, you know, it is the law.  Iron Man goes on the run and tries to clear his name.   Death of Captain America after a drawn out process by the writers to prove he is no longer of any value and that he is outdated.  You know because he was brought out of the ice and still has the mindset of someone from the 40's who distrusts Nazi's.  (hmmm Red Skull, Baron Von Struker, Baron Zemo....) no reason to distrust Nazi's these days...right.   The whole Idea of the Illuminati (Dr. Strange (Sorcerer Supreme), Namor (King of Atlantis), Professor Xavior (Leader of X-men), Iron Man (An Avenger, Rich, and Leader of Shield), Black Bolt (Leader of the inhumans, living on the moon),  Mr. Fantastic (Leader of the first Super Hero team in marvel and the first Marvel family the Fantastic four, Also one of the top scientific minds in Marvel.)  These 6 are secretly running everything?  Is this a very heroic thing?  Years ago, they decided it was a good idea to attack the Skrull homeworld to teach them a lesson and warn them not to come to Earth again.  This really backfired when they were captured and their DNA was copied.  Here comes the latest Skrull invasion...   The Illuminati also tricked Hulk into going into space and launched him off to live on a peaceful planet forever...for his own good of course.  Here comes World War Hulk, yeah, not a good idea to make Ol' Green skin angry is it...   Hulk after coming back deciding to make the villains/heroes (Iron man, Dr. Strange, Mr. Fantastic, and Black Bolt) go through what he went through on the Planet Sakarr as if to teach them a lesson.  At least he gave the thumbs down when asked if they should live or die.  Should have been the world breaker.   Jason Todd brought back to life...   Death of the Martian Manhunter for no reason at all...by a no-name villain.   Marvel saying No more smoking in comics, Wolverine now chews on a toothpick.   Beast has evolved one step too far for my liking.  He looks like an animal now, which is probably what they wanted....you know he is a Beast.       Gosh I can go on and on....      here is what I've seen recently that I DO like:        Storm has married Black Panther        Sentry has potential        I love the Thunderbolts when they first started, storyline really dwindles around issue 50 or so.        Robin, Tim-Drake, is still cool.        The Young Avengers, If only they had left out the two openly gay characters.. .        I like the revamping of old obscure characters, or taking old "lame" characters and making them worthwhile again.  Captain Cold recently.       What I'd like to see:        I wish they would do a really good Aquaman story.        I would like to see a good Angel (the X-men) storyline.        More movies based on the Great Stories each have had.  (I'd love to see Secret Wars done).        Really looking forward to the Watchmen movie.

I went to a festival last year and witnessed the most amazing band on earth. Tenacious D. That day, was the greatest day of my life.      I got given a material wristband on entry to the festival grounds, which has since then, been on my wrist for the last like 7 months.       It's being held on by a little yellow plastic tube thing.... But i've heard if you take it off, it breaks and you can't get it back on....      So, my question is - how do I get it off, and back on without tieing a knot in it, or anyone know what these little yellow things are called so I can buy one or something?      I want to take it off so I can occasionally wear a watch on that arm which would otherwise look stupid with the wristband.      Thanks!

20090225134330AA5kWeM	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Hey about this of Wile E and Road Runner?	what if they had those two things in Wile E Coyote and Road Runner, what if one episode Wile E and Road Runner switched places and Road Runner is the one who chases and tries to catch Wile and does all the traps      And what if Wile E Coyote catches Road Runner normal sized (he did when he shrunk in a desert but ROad Runner was gigantic to him) what would he do to road runner, what is your speculation? MY dad loves Wile E and he thinks Wile E would hesitate to eat Road Runner, kiss him and let him go and then chase him again. WHAT DO YOU THINK??   Guess what sound Road Runner makes and what if Wile E pounces on Road Runner when he (WHY DOESNT HE!) goes up behind Wile E, what sound would Road Runner make if he carried Road Runner?       what do you think of this when Wile E walks in the air and looks down and then falls down? (my dad thinks that is overdone!)

20090128110455AAhuMIk	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Does this sound like a cheerleader to you?	I guess I'm just your average girl with a knife in my back and a grip on my tongue. Might as well say my hands are tied. I've been many places which have mapped my way and I've met great and horrible people who have molded me to the girl I am today. I've never aspired to be extraordinary. I'm just the girl in the back with her hair down, friends gathered around, daydreaming about things you'll never understand. I don't need a boyfriend to tell me I'm beautiful and that he's in love. I love my guy friends that kick me around and tell me I'm useless. My hair never falls quite the same way and my eyes are just plain ol' green. I'll never be the graceful girl, my feet are too clumsy. I'll never shine to every guy nor do I want to. I can never hold a grudge no matter what. I say stupid things and take them all back. I'm just me...           That's how she describes herself which I think is exact.    She listens to rock, plays guitar, and hangs out with "emo" boys.    Does this sound like the sterotype of a cheerleader to you?

20090225082511AAOsJyz	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	What did you think of Law & Order: UK?	The first episode of the UK version of Law & Order was on Monday. I'm a fan of the US series and was dying to see it. OveralI liked it. The coat Bradley Walsh wore and his demeanour suggested that his character was based on Briscoe. I liked the storyline. The twist was a bit weird, a bit too American. I think they should have stuck to whether to prosecute the mother or the babysitter. Although I think it was based on one of the American episodes. They didn't really explore Freema Agyeman's character, but there was some chemistry between her and the other dectective. That's my opinion. It may do well. Started off with 6m viewers, but that can easily slope off. What did you all think?

I know Capricorns are not the best to get involved in a relationship with though. especially for Sagittariuses because we are so different. I have Mars in Scorpio, Pluto in Scorpio. Ceres in Capricorn. Moon in Leo, Vesta in Leo. Chiron in Gemini. Juno in Pisces, North Node in Pisces. Ascendant in Aquarius. Jupiter in Aries. and Mercury, Saturn, Uranus, Midheaven, Pallas in Sagittarius. and I want to be in a long term relationship maybe even marry the person but I can never seem to find the right person for me. Im going to school right now and I like a Cancer guy and a Pisces guy but both I don't like THAT much really. the Cancer guy never has anything worth talking about but we have such great chemistry and the Pisces guy I'm pretty sure doesn't like me that much although I'm friends with his friend who is an Aquarius. I guess I shouldn't be picky at this point but I'm just curious to know which sign would be better for me at this point. I'm 21. I really like Capricorns, Geminis, Sagittariuses, Aquariuses and Libras the best. Don't really like Leos or Aries THAT much tbh. hope you can help me out. thanks. :)

20090128133554AAmFBdo	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	ELEVATOR FUN.......afraid of elevators? you won't be anymore.........?	WOULD YOU DO ANY OF THESE?      When you get off the elevator, whisper to the others who stayed on, "I'd get off the elevator NOW if I were you."      When the other people in the elevator leave, yell "SHARON!" (   Hum the "Mission Impossible" theme, speak into your lapel and say "Right, Jim".       When there is only one other person in the elevator, tap them on the shoulder and then pretend it wasn't you.      Sit with a desk, pencil cup and a telephone in the elevator. When someone walks in, ask if they have an appointment.      Push a button, pretend it gave you a shock. Smile and go back for more.      Ask the others in the elevator which floor they're going to, but push the wrong buttons.      Call the Psychic Hotline and ask them if they know which floor you're on.      Hold the doors open as if you're waiting for a friend, but then let it close. Say to nobody, "Hey, Wally, how's it been?"      Drop a pen, wait for someone to pick it up and then yell, "That's mine!"      Put a cardboard box in the corner; when someone gets on ask them if they can hear ticking.      When the doors close, announce, "Don't worry, they'll open again soon."      Enforce a group hug.      Open your purse slightly and say, "Do you have enough air in there?"      Tell one of the other passengers that you're sorry, but you're going to have to let him go.      Wave hands wildly at invisible flies buzzing around your head.      Make race car noises when anyone gets on or off.      Shave.      Crack open your briefcase or purse, and while peering inside ask: "Got enough air in there?"      Stand silent and motionless in the corner, facing the wall, without getting off.      When arriving at your floor, grunt and strain to yank the doors open, then act embarrassed when they open by themselves.      Greet everyone getting on the elevator with a warm handshake and ask them to call you "Admiral".      On the highest floor, hold the door open and demand that it stay open until you hear the penny you dropped down the shaft go "plink" at the bottom.      Stare, grinning, at another passenger for a while, and then announce: "I've got new socks on!"      When at least 8 people have boarded, moan from the back: "Oh, not now... motion sickness!"      Bet the other passengers you can fit a quarter in your nose.      Frown and mutter "gotta go, gotta go" then sigh and say "oops!"      Sing along with the Muzak.      Show other passengers a wound and ask if it looks infected.      Walk on with a cooler that says "human head" on the side.      Stare at another passenger for a while, then announce "You're one of THEM!" and move to the far corner of the elevator.      Leave a box between the doors.      Ask each passenger getting on if you can push the button for them.      Wear a puppet on your hand and talk to other passengers "through" it.      Start a sing-along.      When the elevator is silent, look around and ask "is that your beeper?"      Draw a little square on the floor with chalk and announce to the other passengers that this is your personal space.      Announce in a demonic voice: "I must find a more suitable host body."      Carry a blanket and clutch it protectively.      If anyone brushes against you, recoil and holler "Bad touch!"      While the doors are opening, hurriedly whisper, "Hide it. quick!" then whistle innocently.

20090128124154AANaGyL	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	WARNING: Please do not click if you haven't read past Twilight.....Anyway, What do you think about this?	I was reading this article in this magazine and it had an interview with Rob Pattinson and stuff, and underneath it there was a thing telling us that the New Moon movie was official and it was saying how Jacob was a werewolf, but that's the whole point of New Moon, Jacob has a secret and we have to find out not be told, and they kinda reiun the other two books for us too as they we're telling us who's battling for the role of Leah but they said that she's a werewolf. Do you think that they're totally reuining the books for people who haven't read them?

20090128131349AAge1Ev	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Are you right or left-eyed?	Make a circle with your thumb and first finger. With both eyes open look at an object on the wall or in the distance, and centre it inside the circle. Now close one eye, and then the other.       When you closed your left or right eye you should have found that the object jumps outside the circle. If the object seemed to move when you closed your left eye – then you have left eye dominance. If the object moved more when your right eye was closed, then your right eye is the dominant one.

20090128132600AAqpXxR	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	SURVEY:  Why are people racist?	I'm not saying any of you are racist, but I notice racism around me all the time, especially on here through the forms of racist comments, questions, and answers.  It is really sad to think that people could be hated just purely for something like the color of their skin, where they were born, or what their religion is.  Most of the time people from a certain category didn't do anything whatsoever to harm the person who is racist.      For example, this one person I saw on Yahoo! Answers (won't state the screenname) said they were embarrased to work with a black person.  Why is that?  What did a black person ever do to that person?  Most likely nothing.      Why can't society as a whole just get along and stop hating on each other?  So many issues could be solved if we'd all just get along.        There is nothing good about racism and no need for it at all.

20090128150857AAJYC1h	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	The young and the restless spoiler Sharon and Nick?	what do you think about this. ----------------------------------------      Last week, Noah was rushed to the ER after he fell through ice at a skating party. Lucky for the Newmans, he's going to make a recovery, much to his father's relief.      "For the time being, Nick isn't even mad that his son had disobeyed once again and was somewhere he wasn't supposed to be," says Joshua Morrow. "I'm sure they're going to talk about this later, but Nick is just thankful he didn't lose another child."      With Noah safe and sound, Nick decides to enlighten Sharon. Her marriage to Jack has failed and she's out of town in a secluded little cabin on a soul-searching mission.      "She's there to be reflective," explains Sharon Case. "She doesn't take divorce lightly. This is a very big deal to her, so she just wants to be by herself and not have everyone confusing her. She has too many people, like, Jack, Brad, Phyllis and Nick, in her ear and making things difficult. She just wants to be alone."      Which also means she doesn't have any cell phone reception. Unable to call his ex, Nick decides to drive up to the cabin and bring Sharon back to her son, who's just survived a trauma. Nick knows that Sharon would want to be with their son at the hospital as he recovers.      However, Phyllis isn't thrilled with the idea of her husband going up to the cabin due to the nasty blizzard that's ripping through town. "The road conditions are terrible and Phyllis wants him to stay with Noah," says Morrow. "Of course, her ulterior thing is that she doesn't want Nick anywhere near Sharon. Phyllis even suggests that either she or Jack to up to the cabin so Nick doesn't have to leave Noah's side, but Nick insists on doing this himself. He's adamant about being the one to tell Sharon what happened. Nick is putting himself in a scenario where he needs to be around Sharon, but he doesn't seem to get that this could make Phyllis mad."      Meanwhile, the cabin starts losing electricity as it is hit with the snowstorm. "Sharon doesn't get nervous," says Case. "Personally, I would be terrified to be up in a cabin all by myself, even in perfect circumstances, but Sharon is fine with it. We're seeing a stronger Sharon altogether. She has food and a fireplace with plenty of wood to burn, so she knows she'll be okay. Obviously, she hasn't seen all those scary movies that I have."      All that time on her hands drives Sharon to write a letter to Nick. "She's alone in the cabin, so what else is she going to do?" chuckles Case. "You start hearing your own thoughts and Sharon can't help but look back on Jack and what happened with their marriage. She will always care for him, but it's over. And Brad has poured his heart out to her, but she had to tell him she doesn't feel the same way about him. She realizes that she has always been in love with Nick. There's no one to talk to about that so she jots down her feelings in a letter. It's just a form of therapy and she has no intention of sending it. She just wants to get those feelings out and be done with them."      Once Sharon finishes the letter, she tosses it into the woodpile with plans of burning it later. Back in Genoa City, Phyllis changes her mind and drives after Nick, but the police refuse to let her proceed because the roads have been closed. "She misses that small window of opportunity," laughs Morrow. "Nick gets enough of a break in the weather to scoot up to the cabin, but once he's there, it's really snowing heavily."      Sharon is surprised when Nick arrives, then begins to panic when he explains why he's there. "She's horrified" sighs Case. "There was that time Cassie fell through the ice and Sharon felt terribly guilty because she wasn't around for that, so she wants to be there for her son."      Even though Nick tries to calm Sharon's fears, she's determined to get back home and see her son. However, as they're trying to leave the cabin, a park ranger arrives with the bad news that all the roads have been closed. Nick is trapped in the cabin with Sharon and they have to ride out the storm together.      The two of them hunker down for the night, and Nick wants to ensure that they have plenty of heat. Nick goes to stoke the fire and he finds the letter that Sharon tossed into the wood pile. "He reads how he is Sharon's one true love and that she never expected her life to turn out the way that it has. She also brings up stuff about their kids, but the whole point of the letter is that she says she wants him back. She doesn't care what he did to her."      Says Morrow: "It's a huge shock for Nick. He never knew that Sharon still had feelings for him in that way. When Nick came out of his two-year amnesia period after the plane crash, he wants to be with Sharon, but everyone had moved on. And, after a while, he remembered his love for Phyllis and fell back in love with her. But Nick has always had a special place in his heart for Sharon. Once he reads that she wants him back, it's like a door is opened.

Anyways, there is this other scene where this one man with a gun goes up to this gangster guy with his daughter. The guy threatens the gangster about something and then when he walks away, he takes out his gun and shoots the gangsters little girl. But then, when he says NOOOOOO!!! he runs up to her and she does not have the bullet in her, as if she did not even get shot.   The guy that "shot" her, leaves.   But yeah, I dont know what this movie is called and I really want to watch it!   I have only seen some parts so if you guys can really cope with me, I will really appreciate it.   Thanx!

20090128112110AAh9qGE	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Miranda Cosgrove vs Miley Cyrus?	Here is my opinion:      I think Miranda is a great actor, especially compared to Miley. She was better than Miley even when she was nine years old on Drake and Josh and was still learning how to act. I like the show i-Carly because all the people on it are such good actors. Those who disagree obviously do not know what good acting is. If you pay attention to how the cast of i-Carly portrays the characters they are acting, you can see just how good they are. Especially the boy who plays Freddie. Personally, I don't really like the actual webshow because I don't have that kind of humor, but I like the rest of the show (especially the parts that Spencer is in). But i like how they connect with all different types of humors.      Hannah Montanna pretty much ruined Disney Channel for me. I only watch Nick now (I like i-Carly, Spongebob, and George Lopez. Drake and Josh is okay now and then). Miley sucks at acting so much. I want to kill myself every time she says something like "sweet niblits" or "say what?". I think the only reason she was even on that show was because of her father. It pisses me off how much publicity she gets for her "talent". The only reason little kids watch her is because they can't recongnize good acting.       I also prefer Miranda's songs to Miley's. I love "Leave it all to me" and "About you now". The fact that there are like four songs about Mileys "double life" annoy me, especially the fact that little kids actually like them. I don't understand how people actually like Miley's singing or how the producers of Hannah Montanna thought she was talented, because her voice sucks. She reminds me of the people who sing for Kids Bop.       I know that Miley is considered prettier than Miranda and all that. But I like how Miranda has her own style, rather than Miley who tries hard to be "punk" or "unique". I also like the fact that Miranda stays out of the gossip magazines because she never does anything wrong. You see Miley in the spotlight all the time. It would be different if she was in magazines because she actually did something talented, but she hasn't.       I know there have been questions like this out there, but they were resolved and I just wanted to state my oppinion. So what do you guys think? Also, if you want to talk about Selena or Demi, that's fine. I don't really know how good they are at singing or acting because I haven't seen "Camp Rock" and I never watch Disney Channel anymore. Just say what you think.

I first heard Three Days Grace's One X album in I think summer of 06'.  My mom was taking me to the mall or something, and she was playing Pain (now one of my favorite songs).  I remember asking why he liked pain so much teehee.  yeah...So, my favorite songs by them are Pain, Animal i Have Become, Never Too Late, I Hate Everything About You, Just Like You, One X, and about a million other ones.  Basicly, I like them all.  I like Never Too Late because the lyrics just seemed erily familiar, Just Like You cause it just has a good message-I don't have to be like all of you- and i like I Hate Everything About You because I had just gotten through a rough break up and it was just like and anthem.        so...what's your's?  I didn't give a reason for every song because I'd be keeping you here all day...

20090128150705AAhQ7Xz	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What is with Star Wars Special editions?	Does that suck or what?       I mean, I don't think I have ever seen an original star wars piece of film! They're all "special editions", and I'm not sure what that means.       I saw episode 4 on this dvd which I think was special edition, and it has these giant clearly computer generated figures wondering around, especially in Mos Eisley, I think everyone is aware of that.    I'm not sure, did they have that kind of technology in the 70's? Unlikely!       What's the deal man? I hate it, not knowing what was done then or not.    Star wars is remarkable for a number of reasons that goes beyond comprehension, but one of them is the cutting edge innovative and ahead of it's time special effects, but this way, I can't tell what is real and whats not.       There was an episode of South Park about this ("Free Hat - 609" if I'm not mistaken), and they focused solely on this.       So, CLARIFY, ELABORATE, EXPLAIN, TEACH ME, O' STAR WARS CONNOISSEURS. What is original and what isn't, was Luke's speeder like that?      I'm imagining I am not the only or the last angry man, I'm thinking this question is absolute heaven for some people, it's exactly what they've  been waiting for, is it that way^? Is that the scenario?      (By the way, where can you get the originals then?)

20090128152151AA0N8yj	Entertainment & Music;Magazines	Do you think Teen Ink is sexist?	I picked up a copy of the reader-submitted essay magazine Teen Ink today.  For the most part it's pretty well written: a little on the left side of the political spectrum but nothing too bad.  However, I did notice that most of the articles were written by female authors.  Out of the 30 or 40 poems and essays in the magazine, only about 5 were written by male authors.      Now I understand that guys aren't the most likely people to write into a magazine like Teen Ink, but I was wondering if it could somehow be a sexist decision on Teen Ink's part to include such a large majority of female writers.

20090128152302AA0eLMv	Entertainment & Music;Television;Comedy	What episode of Three's Company features a scene where Jack and Janet fight over taking off Chrissie's jacket?	I'm a high school student directing a play that features scenes from Three's Company. I need to identify the episode that has a specific scene so that I can buy the corresponding DVD to play during the show. From the script:      "The scene has Chrissie standing between Jack and Janet. Chrissie is wearing a fur coat and as Jack tries to get her to take it off, Janet gets her to put it back on. The scene continues as the two circle around Chrissie, one taking off a sleeve of the jacket, and the other putting it back on."      Thanks!

20090128152613AAg67vB	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	I need a couple of pranks or jokes to get people back! (Keep in mind they are all girls)?	So, amongst our group of friends we have started a little war. It started with us boys just doing stupid things to the girls, hanging their jocks out their car window as we drive through town, stealing their hub-caps and silly things like that.      Recently retaliation has started and my car was filled with little tiny bean bag balls, yeah it was pretty funny and it is safe to say it was deserved, but I want to have the last laugh lol. The girls we hang with are pretty hopeless with cars so we were going to jack one of their cars up take the wheels of and put it on bricks, but set the bricks just to low so that each wheel would have to be jacked up to put them back on.. lol.. very funny to me but maybe a little more extreme, I don't really want to seem them cry so I am looking for some idea's from the answer's community! One of the girls is a sister to a mate of mine so we have access to her clothes, house, everything.. Except she goes away for uni in a few weeks so we need to act fast!      We need some really good idea's but they should not cause permanent damage or cost anymore then $20 to fix or take a day or two lol. Alright get your thinking caps on and give me some idea's. The best idea will be rewarded with the 10 points...      Cheers
20090128152622AAn854C	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Can you solve this riddle?	mice are notoriously fast reproducers. they mature in a month and then after that. give birth every 2 weeks to 12 babies per batch(i forgot the animal term for it...). suppose u buy a baby mouse right on the day it is born. how many mice will u have after 10 months? use 4 weeks for 1 month.
