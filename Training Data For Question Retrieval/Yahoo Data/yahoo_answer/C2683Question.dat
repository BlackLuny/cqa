20090223024648AAYV8qD	Pets;Horses	How do you treat/manage/prevent 'sweet itch' in horses?	Hi, my question relates to the itchy skin condition known as 'sweet itch' or Qld itch, which is caused by an allergic reaction to bites by small insects.       I have two horses affected by it - one bay Icelandic (they are prone to sweet itch) and one brown/black standardbred. I find the darker horses seem to get bitten more often by the insects. I currently rug them and use fly masks etc, and alternate between a strong insect repelent ("Brute") and fly spray. I have heard that trying to keep the horses in at dusk/dawn (when the insects are active) helps prevent bites, and that sulpur (in the diet and applied to skin) also helps.       I'd be grateful for any suggestions or advice. Any personal experience, products, books, websites, research, anything would really help! I'm also interested in any natural oils or supplements that would help repel the flies and/or treat the rash.      Thank you!

My horse has a short coat and is always blanketed in the winter so i don't have to do a lot of clipping before show season starts but she gets a few random long winter hairs here and there.

20090223025112AAtLHjA	Pets;Dogs	Puppy won't go #2 outside?	I have a 10 week old mini dachshund. I understand he's little and there is about 5 inches of snow outside not to mention about 21 outside. But he will go outside first thing and go pee. Then plays in the snow for up to 10 mins. After that he just wants to run over to my feet, jump up and cry. As soon as we walk into the house he runs and rides and poops. I have been taken his poop outside with us and putting in where I want him to go. But it snows over it but I'm still trying.    HELP??!!!
20090223025226AAK3TEu	Pets;Horses	Can anyone recommend a good book or website to learn about horse conformation?	Hi, I would like to know of a good book or website to learn more about horse conformation.       I'd like to improve my ability to "pick a good horse" and understand some of the different qualities which are desirable in a good horse. I'd also like to be able to better pick faults and flaws in horses conformation.      I'm looking for a book that has good pictures and diagrams (it's one thing to 'know' the theory, but another to be able to put it into practice when judging different horses of different breeds, ages and body types). It would be good if this book was still in print and/or available online or on ebay or something.      Thank you!

I've never had to use one before, but now have a small mare with very low withers and she needs one to prevent the saddle moving. How tight do I have the crupper? How do I know if it's too tight or too loose? Should I fasten the crupper before or after I have fastened the girth?      Thankyou!

20090223031632AAn1iNo	Pets;Horses	Random Q- How do you mount? Ground, Stool, or Leg-up?	Just curious in everyones preferance on how to get on their horses.   Do you get on from the ground, use a stool or get a leg up?      I usually get on from the ground, because the pony I've been riding moves so you have to have someone hold her, and that's not always possible. Plus she's small enough, getting on from the ground is easier.   And I hate leg-ups, I always kick someone xD Or get flung to the other side. *sigh*

20090223031001AA6YyOZ	Pets;Cats	How long did it take for your old cat to get along with the new kitten?	My female cat (spayed) named Cleo is kinda moody. She doesnt like children and doesnt like other animals.    We got our kitten, Cosmo (male about 6-7 weeks old) a few days ago. Cleo is tolerating him but is still hissing and smacking him. They can lay together in the same cat bed just as long as Cosmo doesnt get in her face or jump on her. Right now they are sleeping back-to-back in Cleos cat bed :3      How long did it take for your older cat to get along with your new kitten? Did they start playing together?      Im just curious how long it might take for Cleo to warm up to him and if anyone has any stories to tell?

20090223034717AAyoZG9	Pets;Dogs	Eye contact question!?!?!?	Hey all!!      This might sound like a stupid question, and please don’t judge!! So last night I was playing with Hershey, and he jumped up on my bed. I was in a really good mood, so instead of jumping up and pulling him off, I let him sit for a second. I asked him to get down, and he looked at me (as he usually does) and I started staring him in the eye. His ears perked up, His tail started wagging, but his eyes didn’t move. I started “intensifying my stare” (making my eyes bigger, leaning a bit closer in toward him) and he started growling, and then barking. I didn’t take my eyes off of him, and kept the energy the same and he kind of growled/cried then put his head down, and then jumped off the bed!!! I was amazed!! Why did he do this? Did I scare him? Was I showing him that I was the alpha dog and it actually worked? He’s never responded so quickly, and afterwards I felt as though I had scared him…. Like I said, don’t judge!! I’m still learning!

20090223040114AALS8Ao	Pets;Cats	Help there is a bobcat roaming our backyard and there are little kittens!?	for the past four months we have been feeding this stray cat (was a kitten when we first saw her).  She won't come in, even though we have tried countless times.  She also has two other cats that follow her, so I guess you could say we've been feeding all three for quite some time.      Last night she and her friend came to be fed and I noticed a very odd and large cat appearing in the middle of my yard.  I thought it was the "third" cat, until he walked onto my porch and chased the other cat away. (*my cat is a little, all white female and I'm pretty sure she's is in heat, which could explain why her friend was following her*)      My cat continued to eat her food, as if she didn't see this bobcat.  But then I think she realized it b/c when she looked up at him, she scurried away into the bushes and he followed her fast :(      Then last night around 4 there was LOUD hissing and meowing outside.  It was so disturbing that I couldn't get back to sleep....I keep thinking about my poor cat and her friends.        I don't know what to do!  I don't know if I should buy one of those cages that catches the cats or if I should call my apartment complex so they can warn other neighbors not to let their cats outside.        What should I do?        P.S.---I researched bobcat online, and I am about 98% sure.  They say bobcats are maybe a little bigger than a domestic and they of course have the bob tail, which he had.  Plus his face wasn't like a cats...his cheeks were really puffy and his face was wide, not narrow.  And his eyes...they weren't domestic...they were wild... :(

Alright this happened in my 10 GAL All my fish were normal one day and then the next they all seemed sick, not knowing what they had (because they showed no signs of any illnesses i know) I treated for a broad amount of things. (melafix, salt and stress coat) The next day all the plants in the tank had this nasty brown boogery looking slimy stuff on them, a couple of the fish had already died.  And there was algae growing , which is weird because I only had the light on for 5 hours a day and it was no where near a window or natural light source.  Nest day all the fish were dead. The brown slime covered ever cloth surface in the tank (all the plants and filter) and the algae was on all the hard surfaces.  Now you tell me what the hell just happened to my tank?

20090223021658AAHvwoH	Pets;Dogs	Please help!! My adopted dog is terrified of storms and don't let us sleep! What can we do?	Hello!! I hope someone can help me, because me and my husband are about to go crazy.       A week ago we adopted a female Shih Tzu from our local shelter, she was dumped by her previous family because she was getting old (she's 6 years old) but honestly I think they spoiled her way too much when she was a puppy and end up with a dog with very bad behavior problems.       We are trying to train her and be very patience, and in general is working but there's one thing that is driving us insane. She is terrified of storms, so she start scratching the doors nonstop and if she's in her crate, she barks nonstop. We have tried to ignore her and not increase her fear but don't work, we have tried to pet her and calm her down but don't work.      The only thing that seems to calm her down is letting her into the bedroom with us (which she is not allowed in normal circumstances). The first days she croll under the bed but now she wants to be in the bed with us and if we put her down, she will jump again and again.       I don't want her in the bed because I have allergies, so having my bedroom (specially my bed) dog free is a must for me.       How can we train her to stop doing that?? How can we teach her to stay calm in one place?? Or if anyone have a dog afraid of storms, how you deal with it?? Also our other dog is starting to copy this behavior.       Please don't tell me take her to training classes or to a behaviorist, in the country were I live people is still learning how to treat animals, there's still a lot of animal abuse, so finding classes has proved to be almost impossible.       Thank you so much!!

I am moving from the UK to Portugal and have booked a flight with TAP Portugal since they allow cats in the cabin. Now I am looking for an airline approved cat carrier, but haven’t found one yet.

20090223013544AAkR76k	Pets;Dogs	My dog has developed an annoying, costly, and unhealthy habit. What brought this on?	I have a four year old Black Lab/Rottie cross that has for the past few months, taken to gnawing the top of her foot (not the padded area).       At first I thought she may have fleas or some other pest, so I bathed her, but she persisted. I checked her foot for ingrown hair and sores or infection, but there's nothing there that I can see (nor the vet for that matter).      Emotionally, she doesn't seem to be frustrated or diminished in any way, just her playful four year old self, nor is she purposly destroying anything else in the house. And thankfully, the other two dogs haven't taken on this weird cannibalism either.      I have no idea why she does it, but she'll go at it until her paw is as bloody as a horror movie prop if no one is watching her. We've tried a few creams and anti-biotics, not to mention she's had her head stuck in a plastic cone for the past 5 months-- and this creature thunders around like a stung bull! My walls and wallet can't take it any more.      What's wrong with her?  =(

20090223032656AAspRxd	Pets;Dogs	Ho do you react when an aggresive dog approaches your dog?	I was out walking our Greyhound when three girls approached us with their three dogs (two collies one jack russel). Two of the dogs were off the lead. The little one started barking at us, and then unfortunately my dog barked back. At that moment one of the collies charged at us and started fighting with my dog. I tried to stay calm and the only thing I could think of at the time was to pull my dog away and walk in the opposite direction dragging my dog along with me. This has now caused my dog to bark at other strange dogs when we approach. What is the correct way to respond in this situation?

They were a toy poodle and a rat terrier.  He kept a roll of toilet paper by the back door and every time they came in from going potty, he wiped their butts.  He wiped their feet too.      I thought this was odd and I told him so.  He would say he didn't want poo on his carpet or sofa or wherever.  I never though wiping a dog was necessary, as they lick themselves clean.

Now that the baby is here he doesnt listen, pees in the house poops in the house (in my sons doorway actually), he chews up anything and everything.   One day I think I must have left a teetee diaper on the floor and he chewed it up all over the house, and pooped on the floor by my side of the bed!!!   My girl dog doesnt do anything wrong around the house, she just nips people here and there!   They are both Boston Terriers...male is 3 and female is 5. They were totally spoiled before we had a baby. Now I just CAN NOT treat them how I did. I am at a loss as to what to do! I dont want the jealously to turn into them hurting my son. I try my hardest to make them not be like that...I let them sniff my son (with me right there!) I let them kiss his little feet, I never "shoo" them away from him if they seem interested....I just dont know what else I can do! Help!

What can I do to help him? I am really worried about him. Taking him to the Vet is apparently not an option because I havent been able to find a Vet that deals with Turtles at all.    No rude comments please... I have owned RES for years and I know how to take care of them and what they need to grow and be healthy. I have never had a sick one before (this one came from turtlesale.com and has been sick on and off since I got him several months ago), and I just dont know what to do now. I would be more than willing to take him to a Vet, but like I said I can not find a Vet anywhere that deals with turtles. I think this is because in my state it is illegal to own turtles as pets.       Thank you for your help! ^.^
20090223071951AAaUw3K	Pets;Dogs	Bleeding more than a month after surgery.?	My Belgium Shepherd was spayed on 16th Jan this year, two weeks later she came into season, her recovery from surgery was uneventful no infection etc., She always seems to pick up tics from the grass, we have sprayed the grass, used Frontline, and even drops to put on her back and behind her neck.   Since Friday she has become very unwell not taking her food or interested in the usual activities, she has been to the Vet every day, he took a blood smear which turned up positive for a tic that causes hemorrhage (not sure he is truthful here). She still has  vaginal bleeding it's been three days now, if the bleeding was a cause of surgery it would have shown up long before now.   The Vet is talking about doing a Laparotomy to find the cause of the bleed. I am very, very worried and am beginning to mistrust the Vet.   Catgut takes approx 2-3 weeks to dissolve, if he had not tied off a vessel it would have shown up before now.He also told me that the disease he thinks she has kills more dogs than survive.      Thanks for your input and advice.

20090223053039AAyglWT	Pets;Dogs	What caused my dog to die at age 9?	My dog recently passed away a few days ago. It was very sudden and I was glad she wasnt in any pain. However, my family and I cannot afford an autopsy to find out what she died of. When I found her she looked like she had just fallen asleep. She had no bite marks, nothing in her mouth other then a bit of mud on her tongue, hadnt eaten any kind of animal, and wasnt bleeding/swollen anywhere. She was 9 years old which I understand is old for a dog but she was a very youthful dog. She wasnt overweight, she ran everyday and had alot of room to play and was very well taken care of. Even the morning she woke up I was told she was in good spirits and didnt show any signs or symptoms of feeling ill. The only medical problem she ever had was her back legs and that only effected her when she was younger and healed as she got older. I would appreciate any suggestions that anyone might have as to how she had died.

Ok here's a little description of Scamp. I adopted him when he was 8 wks old from a shelter.  He is now 8 months old.  He weighs about 40 lbs and is the height of a cocker spaniel.  He has a medium short wired hair coat (terrier, I know that part).  He has tons and tons of black spots all over him.  More on his legs and stomach but the spots are everywhere on his skin under is coat.  His legs are VERY muscular.  They bend in weird ways when he sits sometimes.  They some times bow out although his legs are very short.  His chest dips down really low.  He is VERY smart and great with kids and VERY loyal.  Now from what you know and then pics in your opinion what kind of dog does he look like to you?  Thanks!!!    **Pics aren't great....they were taken from my camera phone, sry!    http://i96.photobucket.com/albums/l166/j...        http://i96.photobucket.com/albums/l166/j... 
20090223070107AABrHDj	Pets;Fish	How should I treat fish with pop-eye and fin-rot?	I have had my two fish for about two and a half years now. One goldfish (won from the fair) and one shubunkin from the pet shop. They are both in a 21 litre tank and have been fine until now - however now the goldfish appears to have pop-eye in both eyes and one has clouded over. Also his tail fin has started to "rot" and appears torn. My shubunkin is lying on the bottom of the tank but doesn't seem to have any physical problems. Neither of them are eating very much either.      So far I have tried Interpet treatment 9 (Anti-Internal Bacteria), Myxazin and Aquarium salts and none have seemed to help. Today I have just done very large water change and cleaned the tank gravel in case it's some sort of an imbalance in the water to try and help.      What should I do next? I'm guessing I'll lose them eventually if I don't try something else.
20090223071921AAjhOX3	Pets;Reptiles	Is a bearded dragon good for a pet?	We just recently bought a veiled chameleon for our daughter. The pet store advised they were the easiest to take care of and very hardy. MY GOODNESS! From day one thew poor guy was complicated. If I had only known. We did lots of research and learned along the way how wrong they were. We really want to have a reptile but I am having a hard time finding a reputable place for info. Non-biased and what not. ANY info would be appreciated.

She has been a barker from the beginning and we have tried absolutely every technique, short of using the shock collar to curb her continuous barking. She barks when we leave, she barks when we come home, she barks especially when someone comes to the door. I have watched the dog whisperer, tried a whistle, tried muzzling her, tried citronella bark collar. Is the shock collar my last hope? Thanks.

We used to get them blown out and a serious brush down quite often at the groomer. But now since there is nothing close to us, i'm going to have to take it into my own hands. They both shed quite a lot.  They get bathed once a week with  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...  (they are at the dog park 7 days a week and are disgusting by sunday which is the reason for such frequent baths) This is an oatmeal shampoo (they have sensitive skin.) The only brush i can find that works well is a regular human hairbrush with the plastic pins. But it doesn't do the job well. I need to know what shampoos would be good for these guys and a really good brush that would get all the dead undercoat and top coat.

20090223062659AAB67oC	Pets;Dogs	Why does my dog eat 2-3 times as much as the bag says?  He's not overweight, in fact he's pretty skinny.?	He's a 1 year old mini labradoodle and he's been this way since we got him.  At first we only gave him what the bag said, but he always seemed hungry.  Then we noticed he began a disgusting habit of poop eating.  We couldn't stop him, we finally figured he must be starving so we gave him more food.  We gave him 3-4 cups a day when the bag says 1 1/2 cups max per day.  After that he stopped eating his own poop and has calmed down when we get food out for ourselves too.  He seems much happier, but man, he's eating more than double the recommended amount.   He went from about 25# to 35# in a few months and has leveled out.  He's not at all fat, and is a very active dog.  What gives, is this ok?  Should I feed him more protein, or a different kind of food?  He was on Blue Buffalo puppy food, but it was so expensive with the amount he eats that we switched to the Iams all natural when he turned 1 year.  Thanks for your advice in advance.

He just makes this watery sloshing noise at the back of his throat when he's excited or happy. Doesn't make any sounds in his sleep and doesn't slow him down or bother him in any way.

I have a not-so-friendly tabby cat which lived with my Moms dog for a year (a few years ago).  I am going on vacation so I took my cats over to my Moms because shes going to keep them while I am on vacation.  Right away, my cat and my moms dog seemed to remember eachother and were happy to greet eachother.  Within an hour, my Mom called to tell me that her dog picked up my cat by the scruff of his neck and carried him over to her bed and started cleaning him, as if he's a baby pup or something.  She's never had a litter, shes spayed, just instinct I guess?  When he was a baby, my Moms dog did this with him sometimes but we weren't too worried because they seemed to have a Mother/Son relationship and the cat was fine with it.  Now I am a little more worried because my Moms dog is 90 lbs. now and my cat is 9 lbs now.  I don't know if this is a safe situation or if I need to separate them even though I know agression is not the motive.  Have you ever encountered this?

It was localized primeraily to a few spots on her back. She now has a slight hair loss on her upper mouth. Is it possible the demodex was dormant and has resurfaced?

20090223071514AArKHAf	Pets;Dogs	Help with my new puppy?	I got him 3 days ago, and since I got him I've been sleeping downstairs on the sofa with him lying on top of me because he cries and barks during the night. Because of this I've had hardly any sleep and I'm getting more stressed by the day.   What can I do about the crying during the night? Should I just ignore it and it'll stop?    He's a labrador, by the way.

20090223073302AAmWC7s	Pets;Dogs	How do I get my dog scared of cars so she won't run in the street.?	I have a 10 month old black boxer who is very smart except when it comes to running into the street with cars. She has no fear of them. Its crazy. We'll be laying on my bed and the remote will fall and hit the floor and she will jump out of her skin, but a big huge metal car driving past her at 45 mph does not phase her whatsoever.  We live on a busy intersection and where i work has lots of cars as well. Sometimes she gets out and just goes for a run. But she runs full speed into the street. Im afraid she might get hit one day. How do I make her scared of cars? Or the road for that matter. I do not let her out, she escapes sometimes and runs on her own. I always use a leash when I take her out.

20090223073942AAqHTuv	Pets;Dogs	What's going on with my dog?	I have a almost 4 year old German Shepard. She suddenly stopped eating her food like she used to and lost 8lbs.(She does have a appetite, because she will beg us for food while we eat) She vomit's here or there. I took her to the vet and they ran blood test's and everything is coming back fine. She did have a fever of 104. They also did a urine test and that was fine too.  The vet said she is not seeing anything to show her that their's a sick dog. I am very concered about her. I was told we could just feed her a high quality dog food and leave it at that or get more testing done. (Ultrasound etc) Do you have any idea what this could be?
