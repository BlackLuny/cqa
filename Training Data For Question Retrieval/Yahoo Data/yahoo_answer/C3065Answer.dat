ZEwAalKPaa	These are House Clearance companies and they pay peanuts!  They know that anyone using their services wants to get rid of the stuff fast for one reason or another (often to clear a deceased's effects so the house can be sold) and only offer a fraction of the real value.|`|AKkopykNaa	look in the phone book for house clearances  but don't get ripped off ask for more than you expect then they will beat you down|`|99452267df499e5605dfcfb9197d1ec4aa	There are companies that do house clearance but you will only get about 10% of what your stuff is really worth if you are lucky.
kFKA8SXraa	I live in Reynosa, I have had shipments come to Mcallen TX, and Reynosa directly, what I have experienced is that UPS will take 5 - 7 days more when shipping directly to Mexico. Even though I have had the nightmaires of shipments taking 10 -15 days more.|`|KSTrNVBxaa	i recommend you use FedEx next time , i send a pack via FedEx over night and they received just fine the next day you sure contact them right away
LqaxvacSaa	If you buy them now, you will be fine.  You would only have to pay the new price after the price change goes into effect. Just make sure you use it before the expiration.|`|ycplUxxJaa	If you're buying a monthly card it has to be used within 30 days of the purchase date or it expires and if you never used it it's a hassle to get the credit - they make you mail in the card etc and it takes a while, which would defeat the purpose of stocking up.|`|JWNzoksmaa	I doubt it will be valid after the price goes up.
15e75cc83e026da5def65e0733f69023aa	We cant tell you without more details..<br>  Work it out...write down all your expenses and subtract them from your wages that will let you know what you have left each month...|`|AA11510511	It depends on a few things. <br>  <br>  Do you live in your own home?<br>  <br>  Do you have bills to pay??<br>  <br>  How many hours you will do per week??|`|gpSandWLaa	Your hourly rate would be approx ￡6. 20p per hour.|`|ivjHOJ8daa	That's a diffcult question to answer. <br>  It would all depend on how many hours you got at Tesco and what your<br>  outgoing was every month.<br>  <br>  If you do get a job at Tesco, make sure you agree to work Satrudays and Sunday's as the premiums on top of your hourly rate for these days are very good. Also, if you can manage it, take up nightshift at Tesco as the 'Unsociable Hours' premiums are quite good too.<br>  <br>  You could be making up to ￡8.00 an hour. Not the best, but also not the worst.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|claUGpVRaa	Well that's kind of up to you!<br>  <br>  Do you have to pay rent/mortgage?<br>  Do you have to pay utility bills?<br>  Mobile phone bill?<br>  Car to run and maintain?<br>  Children to support?<br>  Any other debts to pay off?<br>  <br>  Also, will you work full time or part time? Your hourly rate? etc etc<br>  <br>  How long is a piece of string really?????|`|Z10Oed2faa	loll<br>  thanks for telling us how much you get an hour and how much you work<br>  plus your expenses getting there,what you spend going out.<br>  alot of factors you need to think about<br>  <br>  average wage is about ￡12,000 a year full time|`|pTYLDRugaa	1 month and a half|`|Vtcu0MV9aa	Long time a Suppose ask someone who works there or the manager ?

Nobody will rat out a place that is doing illegal things and would you want to risk your body to them?
J6Tdrd8Xaa	You have to be an adult before you can do that or with the consent of your parents. You must apply to change it through deed poll. You can also get a statutory declaration from a solicitor which is a legal document saying you wish to be known as another name, this is not the same as changing it through marriage or deed poll though, You can apply for a passport in the new name once you have the declaration, you also need your birth certificate when you apply for a passport.<br>  I did it when I was 19 and regretted it, I'm now 33 and luckily I never applied for a passport in the new name so I was able to get a passport in my birth name. I never used the new name much though I had a bank account in it and applied for benefits. You can call yourself anything you want you know?, but to obtain any documents like a passport or driving licence you need to change it legally.<br>  <br>  EDIT It depends on the solicitor, when I did mine in 1994 it cost me ￡5. Get the yellow pages and ring a few solicitors, ask how much it cost to get a "statutory declaration for a name change", they will tell you. Then you just have to visit the solicitor having printed out what you're going to say, read out the name you wish to be known  as from the date you wish to be known the new name from, he will sign it and you then have the document.<br>  <br>  for example;<br>  <br>  "As of June 1st 2009 I no longer wish to be known as Maureen Jane Bloggs but as Russellina Poppyhead Brand".<br>  <br>  You declare that to the solicitor, he signs the document and you're good to go!.|`|3dT7f39maa	Go to a solicitor and ask for a deed pole. Should cost around thirty quid.<br>  <br>  I changed my name and i love it now.|`|bGyVJ6meaa	You need to change yr name by deed pol, ever with parentel permission or when you are an adult<br>  <br>  You can then apply to renew passport etc with this new name<br>  <br>  See website for further info<br>  <br>  EDIT: Perkins, what did u call yrself, why, and why did u regret it?
EYxuOoL8aa	An annuity is an investment vehicle sold primarily by insurance companies. Several types of annuities exist. Every annuity has two basic properties: whether the payout is immediate or deferred, and whether the returns are fixed (guaranteed) or variable. An annuity with immediate payout begins payments to the investor immediately after it is purchased, while deferred payout means that the investor will receive payments at some later date. An annuity with a fixed return offers a guaranteed return by investing in low-risk securities like government bonds, and is commonly known as a fixed annuity. An annuity with a variable return offers results that vary with the performance of the funds (called sub-accounts) where the money is invested, for example stocks. This article discusses fixed and <br>  <br>  variable annuities, and gives a list of sources for additional information about annuities.
