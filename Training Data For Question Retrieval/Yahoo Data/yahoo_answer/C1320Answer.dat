9VAnsWYUaa	Duke. There is no woman's sides          Can hide the beating of so strong a passion          As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart          So big, to hold so much. Women lack retention.          Alas, their love may be called appetite.          Not motion of the liver, but of the palate,          That suffers surfeit, cloyment, and revolt;          But mine is all as hungry as the sea          And can digest as much. Make no compare          Between the love a woman can bear me          And that I love Olivia.     Viola replies, in one of her most famous passages (Act 2, Scene 4):            Viola. My father had a daughter loved a man;          As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,          I should love your lordship.            Duke. And what's her history?            Viola. A blank, my lord: she never told her love,          But let concealment like a worm i' the bud          Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,          And with a green and yellow melancholy          She sat like Patience on a monument,          Smiling at grief. Was this not love indeed?
2op4q59Qaa	I am so sorry for your circumstances. I will pray that God will lift you up and make you strong. You've been given this life for a reason. Find a support group to help you get on your feet. Maybe go volunteer with children who have witnessed violent crimes. Turn your pain into a blessing for someone else.     29 And dont be concerned about what to eat and what to drink. Dont worry about such things. 30 These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers all over the world, but your Father already knows your needs. 31 Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and he will give you everything you need. Luke 12:29-31|`|hb1H5XAyaa	no. you should pray.|`|pSaUlVa5aa	hey! if all these strangers are telling you not to do, what do you think your friends would say?  Seek help.|`|9kOtCQrhaa	I am going to be very blunt! Life sucks!! and it will continue to suck forever. I am not going to doll up the answer by saying that it will all get better when in fact there is a better chance of it getting worse. But what I will say is that you should suck up what little pride you have and talk to one of your few friends and ask if you can stay there for a few days or a week or two. I have quite a few problems myself (though to be honest you got me beat) and I thought about killing myself the other day. But what good would that do.Sure i wouldn't feel any more and that sounds amazing right now. But every ones life has a meaning. God has us hear for a reason and yes we are going to suffer. O man are we going to suffer! But we have to stay strong so that we can fulfill what he has in store for us. So should you go back and jump. Yes you should. But not off the garage. Jump away from the thought of killing yourself.|`|FXeuwkX0aa	(1-800-SUICIDE)|`|DbSeqK5Haa	Today I pray this prayer for you, Dear Lord you know this young woman's pain and you know who she is. Please Lord help her find peace with herself. Let her be kind to herself and give her understanding. Only you can make her feel that her life is purposeful. Help her and guide her each day give her strength to face the challenges that life has. May she learn to forgive herself and may she know that you love her.   In the name of Jesus I set her free. Amen|`|0FUWmpZ5aa	wow well you life is better then mine. I lost my job living in a shelter now:( had some crack head stole my laptop with my art work and programs on :(( and now all i have is my i-pod. I would die inside if i had to live wit out it. I can't say how your past is but what keeps me going is my art and my dreams of showing every one the world I'm making a soon as i figure out how to fix my life, get a new laptop, get a place and money again.       wanna be friends :)|`|AA11658197	perhaps you should get out of the big city (New York) some country air and new people may give you a fresh perspective|`|Ljr3Y1wiaa	Try this:move to Texas|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	no you shouldnt. theres ups and downs to everyones life. all the stuff that your going thru right now is only going to make you stronger. lifes too precious and short for you to worry. stop focusing on the hurt and pain and the past. you can only live for you and for now. listen to people laugh and look at babies smiling. theres still good in the world. focus on that. its the little things in life that mean the most.|`|agpCn6Kaaa	Please don't do it.  You have every right to be angry and feel lost due to what you have gone through, but your mother brought you into this world, and she would want you to go on...not give up!  Do this in honor of her, whose life was taken from her.  You can call the Suicide Prevention Hotline and talk to someone 24/7 at:  1-800-273-TALK or 1-800-SUICIDE    Or visit this website:    http://suicidehotlines.com/|`|ez5BjZdRaa	These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world. John 16:33      Do not fear, for I am with you; do not anxiously look about you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will help you, surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand. Isaiah 41:10    Cast your burden on the Lord [releasing the weight of it] and He will sustain you; He will never allow the [consistently] righteous to be moved (made to slip, fall, or fail). Psalm 55:22    Pray about it :) God can help you Just let him.   Suicide is NOT the answer|`|xdM1N6Wjaa	NO! I've been through hell and back too. Tons of people have. I started taking YAZ to stable me out- and it does wonders. Try to think of it as you get so much bad because something great is going to come- you have to get all the bad out so that it's equal. If you put a smile on and learn to love yourself (to a small degree at least) you will probably find it easier to get a promotion or get paid more. You just need to have the right look (many people can see past fake happy... you need to find genuine happy). Just don't kill yourself. Look at the small things that go right in your life. Find someone that needs a roommate- move in, sell your car, and take public transportation or even walking/biking to work. It will do wonders. Exercise can help with your mood too. If I ever get a little depressed I go for a 2 mile walk or swimming and I feel so much better.|`|TAqwdOK8aa	A lot of people are going to try and be cute, thinking themselves cleaving by insulting you or making stupid jokes, on this question. I am not one. You have had a hard life, and one I could not offer anything to help make it seem less-so. However, having faith, to help keep you going? You may as well let that go.     Faith can only go so far. I find that outlook, more than faith, will keep you strong. Try to find enjoyment out of what little you can, for example. I was homeless, in a shelter, for but a short time, but I made the best of it. Not to say I've not tried to end my life, before, but I'm still here, at least.     If nothing else, look for someone that can truly support you, emotionally, when your hope gets low. Someone that can cheer you up and distract you from hard times, even if for only a moment. I'd offer more advice, but I have only so much space. Be strong...And if I add something about praying, do I get a "thumbs up?" Sorry, that was more meant to the general population. Regardless, remember to live for you, no one else.|`|avVdKiWKaa	Many people, including myself, have been in situations like yours.  Maybe not exactly with the same particulars as you describe, but similar enough.  Myself included.  Forget faith.  Just stick it out.  If I had offed myself 30 years ago when I wanted to, I would have missed all the great stuff that came afterwards.  I went from having zero money and begging for food to being well off and not alone.  Forget the past, it's just a sad memory.  It's not easy to kill yourself.  Jumping from a parking garage is  no guarantee of dieing.  But it's a good chance you will feel horrible, unbearable pain.  More pain that you can imagine.  A lot more than working at a **** job.      No, it isn't fair that people who want to live, die, and vice versa.  Nothing's fair, but stick it out anyway.  The dead know only one thing:  It is better to be alive.|`|OdTLUprzaa	You should get professional help.  If you can't afford that or depression medication, seek help from friends, online suicidal websites, or call a free hotline. Some people have it worse of than you and still find joy and meaning in life. Financial situations are tough, but I beg you to ask for help.  If you don't want to, go to a local church and ask for help.  You can't expect to get out of all ruts alone, we are meant to rely on others for support!  There is nothing you can do about other people dying, it happens, you cannot take their place. One thing you can to is to find a way to reach out to and help others going through hard times. Although you can't take their place, you can make a difference, and you will feel great and realize that the impact you make is worth living for.   There are many options to chose other than ending your life and if people who have suffered worse than any of us can understand that they are worth something and can make a difference, you can too.|`|jTh0Vf7saa	I dont know how you feel exactly, Im upset with my life, but if what you say youve been through is true then I should be very ashamed of myself. I cant convince you not to Kill yourself but I can offer advice that I use to get me back on my feet. You are not a waste of life, You are here by a one in a million chance. You can make a difference to the world, and you can start by fighting through this. It takes balls to end your life, but the true hero fights through it. Think of all the amazing things that life has to offer, If you die now you will miss out on those things. I myself would hate to think that I could end my life while all those around me just move on to enjoy full lives. All I can ask you to do is try to see the world in a positive light, Ill make a safe bet that things will start to clear up for you. Keep Fighting, good luck either way.|`|TOnq6w6Baa	No.  You are a valuable person.  Some us struggle and fight for the simplest things in life.  Then there's those who have everything just handed to them,and don't even appreciate what they have.  Why?  Maybe God has a bigger plan for your life that is to big for you to even grasp.  I go thru alot of the stuff  you do, but I hold on.   People all over the world are going thru the same thing.  And sometimes those blessings come soooo unexpectedly.  Keep praying.  Hang in there.  And don't give up.  Tyler Perry went thru the same thing, but he believed there was something better for him.  And he was right!  Read the story of Job, David and Joseph (the one that his brothers sold him into slavery)  from the bible.  The Lord be with you.|`|oYSDEWrfaa	NO, you are most definitely not a waste of life. However all that matter's is what you think and how you feel about yourself in  the end.

You have control over what happens to you now and it will get better, I promise.    Never be embarrassed to tell the truth to your loved ones.  They will offer support, but only if they know you need it.    Fight for your life.

What have you got to lose?|`|UWfkw23laa	Absolutely not.  There's ALWAYS somebody who cares about you, even if you may not know it.  Call a hotline.  Go to therapy.  Do something, get help.  You'll thank yourself for it later.  (1-800-SUICIDE)|`|18K7ucsEaa	No, don't end your life! That's silly to talk like that. It sounds like you're frustrated, and I would be too, but you're gonna have better times ahead. it sounds like you are just lacking a direction in your life and just need to pick something to commit to. If you have never looked into religion, I strongly suggest that you do a little soul searching and find something to believe in.     But, don't get too down, things WILL get better! ;-)
oYSDEWrfaa	Laughter cures the soul. There is nothing wrong with taking yourself on a vacation with laughter hopefully it is contagious. I personally laugh a lot and love funny people.

LOL! i Think you're just like me, I too maintain a serious personality although making me laugh would be as easy as peeling a potatoe, I do however try not to get so funny in funerals and classes and family meetings and such. It's not a problem, if anything youre only adding a positive atmosphere around you, and I bet people only love that. Your sister is just being overprotevtive of you. she seems to think that you laugh in serious times and that it affects your personality negatively. Thats only ok for her being your sister. You do need to know when youre laughing, and wether its expected at the moment or not, try just not to laugh when its appropriate.Other than that you can laugh all you want. Lol.

zQB0kEmcaa	Talk to your 'inner you' and tell yourself to change.  Tell yourself to stay calm and focus on something else.  When I snap because I am in a bad mood I feel bad afterwards ( headache, heart palpitations etc....) - I just tell myself that this is not good for me and that it is not worth getting upset over. I'm sure you are a lovely person but  you just need to control your feelings.  We spend so much time talking to others that we forget to talk to ourselves.  Try it.|`|Myyjyeg4aa	1)  Check to see what medications you may be taking because some can make you have mood swings - such as birth control or diet pills.    2) Make sure you are eating balanced meals and taking vitamins. Go to an endocrinologist and check your hormone levels.     3)  Exercise.  It immediately puts you in a better mood. Most people hate to do it, but it gives you a sense of well being that can't be matched.    4)  Do some form of community service once a month - help animals, children, or the homeless. Volunteer your time.  It will make you feel really good about who you are.|`|AA11658197	search for Buddha, he is the way  or you could try Zen as a lifestyle guideline|`|agpCn6Kaaa	Changing how you react to things can be hard, but if you really want to do it, you have to work at thinking about things first before you respond.

SOme people are opinionated and small minded and don't accept anyone or any idea that's different from who they are.  I personally don't care if someone is gay or not.

There are no laws stopping this behavior, and in fact, the courts often aid this kind of trash.|`|0bYcYz2jaa	For some reason, men are attracted to these women.  My husband was actually a horrible man, a misogynist, chauvinist, you name he was it because of the terrible history he had with women.  We dated for three months and I single-handedly changed his opinion of women.  He says he never had the pleasure of meeting a woman who was intelligent, but not obnoxious about it, honest and not manipulative, and who didn't think anyone owed me anything.  I got by with what I earned.  I never saw a reason to blame my problems or troubles on anyone.  I am responsible for me.  I choose to make my life better or worse.  I am a real woman.  As for the woman in your story, I think I know her kind.  My husband dated one for two weeks, and *POOF*, she's pregnant, threatens to abort, demands money to abort, disturbs our wedding planning, then denied visitation for the first 9 months of my step-son's life, and made us miserable for most of his 5 years.  She seems to have calmed down some but I still maintain that she's out of her freakin' mind.  She should be grateful that he has a good father.  EDIT:  Mike, we are just really hard to find.  We don't make so much noise(about being women or victims).
mCAWxobNaa	I just consider my sexuality a very private matter that I don't think should be a topic for discussion any moreso than my income.    It's very personal and I don't understand why in the US human sexuality needs to be adressed so flippantly.    I think certain things should not be a matter for public discussion.    I don't define myself by by sexual preference nor do I feel like discussing something so personal with strangers.  People who feel that our sexual preference is an integral part of just who we are seem to have lost sight of the fact that there are much more important things in our lives, such as how we treat others, how we do things to make life better for others and so forth.    There's no question that human sexuality is a major part of our lives, but I think that people and the mdeia sepnd too much time discussing these things.  I'd prefer that such things be kept between a man/women and their sig others or close friends.  I personally don't concern myself with others' sexual exploits.    I don't have any issue with homosexuals, I just don't think that so much time should be spend discussing their sexual llives.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	No, I don't. I'm happy being in the 'comfortable' zone myself ! I'm eligible to be in there.|`|FhKtIk2Paa	I wish I could say I don't project my sexuality, but I do because I assume most people are sexually active.  I've had friends who I thought were sexually active, but then found out later they weren't.  There was no reason or evidence to make me think this way- I just thought they were like me!    It's good to analyze yourself like this because you'll understand more about yourself and others afterwards. Good question!|`|ZjCurM7saa	When I first meet somebody, I give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they're normal. That is, I don't assume that they're into animals, baby diapers, chains, whips, children or other members of the same sex. Nor do I assume that they have bodies buried in their basement, that they are the head of an underground Nazi movement or that they are a feminist. It would be odd if anybody assumed these things about strangers.    "Projection" is a psychological defense mechanism, so you have applied it incorrectly. It is only applied when somebody's feelings conflict with his moral judgment such that he accuses others of having that attribute. In the case of normal persons, they are not concealing their normality in assuming that others are normal and are, consequently, not "projecting".|`|YQOT68xFaa	I don't project it onto other people. But at the same time....I do have trouble understanding the thought of kissing or sleeping with another woman. It is such a foreign thing to me because I am attracted to men. But I know that there are women out there who are attracted to other women. They aren't faking it; they genuinely like women and not men. I'm not projecting, more like scratching my head and then shrugging my shoulders and walking away.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	Absolutely not! I know that my sexuality is not considered socially normal, especially because I refuse to specify it by gender. My sexuality is what hippies have called "pansexuality", in that I'm attracted to people, not genders.    I don't project this to other people. I know that my approach to love and romance is very different from a bunch of other people. All I know is that it works for me, I'm happy, and that I hope they are happy in whatever their sexuality is--in so long as they do not harm others with it.    I don't think women are inherently bisexual. I don't think that men are either. I don't think that sexuality has to be concrete, but for some people, it never changes. For other people it does.    And this is just fine to me. I mean, it's disappointing when someone I'm attracted to is not attracted to me, but I feel no need to insist that they really are.    Everyone likes different flavors of ice cream right? And sometimes, they don't feel like their favorite flavor, sometimes their favorite changes, and someones they always want the same thing. But this is perfectly normal, regardless of what I personally like.    I wish that sexuality was not assumed at all, and that there wasn't a "norm" of heterosexuality. Specifying a norm has lead to all sorts of false ideas and bigotries. I mean, much is made about the time that someone knows they are "gay". But when does someone know they are "straight"? They don't, because it's always assumed.|`|dGwa8sFPaa	No, and aren't I enlightened?|`|U6Fd8MIsaa	Yeah, I think a lot of people do this.  I have no idea why though.

As for projecting my sexuality on others...    If im talking to someone...i want to soley just screw..and call a friend...    Yes, Ill show some sexuality....and right at the brink of collapse...you throw down some self control. If there looking for a friend...and some sexual attention...they love it.    A lack of self control is disgusting...and but its fine to project an almost break of self control in sexuality...and then controlling it. If its straight.    As for gay or bisexual...tendencies...its simply a self control deal. Straight men and women...have enough self control to say no...    Bisexuality and being gay...is a weakness....straight people do not want. Sexuality...is a choice...and is simply a matter of self control. Pushing the boundaries...can be fun...if the right values are involved.    And if your looking for marriage....you dont project sexuality at all. It all depends on what your looking for, if your strong enough to make choices, and what your values are.|`|svOneExjaa	No. I am cursed with a curious mind, which means I listen more than I talk. I also already know who I am by now, so other people are definitely more intriguing to me in their own individuality. I've heard comments your have listed above.

They don't seem to have any problems with telling other individuals of what they think their sexual orientation should be. LOL. So, there is absolutely no need to pay them any attention.|`|wkjncmHTaa	Lol no, I don't assume that people are into the same stuff that I am.

fbeb2b3a6c2e7530b3c5cb36459afcbcaa	Men are generally either straight or gay and have a much easier time understanding which group they fall into to because arousal is very simple  for us (errections are obvious) whereas in women arousal is not as easily displayed physically.|`|ZWePAEZUaa	Perhaps.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	That is a reflection of society not of inherent differences between the sexes.  Open displays of affection between women, even physical affection, are more acceptable than between men and thus women are more willing to express themselves in that way.  In societies like Ancient Greece, where bisexuality was not just accepted but the norm, men were just open as were women.  Alfred Kinsey's studies were based on the behavior of American men and women of his time and that colored his results, you should also bear in mind that the Kinsey Scale was a measuring tool intended to address individual behaviors and thus can't confirm anything about the species as a whole.  You also misuse the term "bisexual", how can a person in an exclusively same-sex environment engage in sex with people of both sexes?  Prisoner behavior would be, by definition, homosexual in both men's and women's prisons since that is the only option.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	No, it's just more socially acceptable in many Western societies to express attraction to women, whether you're male or female. Porn films with lesbians are popular with het men and women, and many ppl will talk about loving them, but how many het men would admit they enjoyed watching gay porn? Gay men are still afraid to come out, because of the hatred and violence shown towards gay men. What incentive is there for men to admit they are attracted to men, or attracted to men and women? Like, none? It takes a   brave man to admit he's attracted to men in any way-and depending on where you are or live, it can take a lot of bravery to admit you're a lesbian or bisexual woman as well. If the US can get over it's puritan hypocrisy, we'd find out just how many bisexuals there really are... as well as lesbians and gay men and transsexuals.|`|9VAnsWYUaa	Yes.     They NEED company to go to the bathroom.  They NEED a special room at the fitness center.|`|A71Uu05Uaa	The key is this.    Men were designed to be pleasing to women.  Women were designed to be pleasing in general.|`|U6Fd8MIsaa	I don't know if they are or not.  I think bi women are more out in the open with it then bi men.    Other questions like this have been asked, and a lot of gay and bi men think this way about men as well.  I think that since straight men, like us, have most of the financial and media power, it is just displayed more.  Men generally are more lenient with women as well.  Also, a lot of guys fantasize about it.|`|hHjPFxEdaa	No they are not. It's about equal but men are less likely to admit their bisexuality and more likely to wish bisexuality was a female proclivity so they won't have to own up to their own.      Add  Kinsey et al. (1948) reported, in one of their most controversial findings: "it appears that nearly half (46%) of the [male] population engages in both heterosexual and homosexual activities, or reacts to persons of both sexes, in the course of their adult lives [p. 656]." By extension, with heterosexuals (K=O) representing 50% of the population and exclusive homosexuals (K=6) representing 4% of the population, ambisexuality should be considered almost as common as heterosexuality. Extracting from the original Kinsey data, even if we combine the K=1 behaviors with exclusive heterosexual behavior and K=5 with exclusive homosexual behavior, the size of the remaining ambisexual population remains significant. Indeed, these numbers have been challenged.    Lmao..what planet are you from that you have the inane idea bisexuality is not common in men's prisons? Do some research before you make ridiculous claims. I only brought up Kinsey because you cited Kinsey first. I can cite more studies if you'd like.|`|8675917d6f324c2c4ef2494e8a53406faa	Its a simple deal....called sexual control.    Straight people believe...bisexuality and being homosexual...is a weakness and a choice. So therefore most straight people...have the self control..to say no.    You have a choice to make.    Being "open" about your sexuality...is completely different than choosing your sexuality. Its simply projecting your lusts on to others...to find a partner your looking for...for short term...lusts.    Its two seperate choices...you make...based on values and lusts.    As for me...gay people hit on me daily...    But as a strong heterosexual...I choose to...eat 10s....daily.  (first choice is my sexuality)    After I choose...at 10...to be "friends" with...  Ill project my sexuality by....almost loosing sexual self control....when talking to them....and then gaining complete self control.     This process...shows your sexuality...that you want to screw...but that you have complete self control...of the huge sexual urges within you. Women...who are looking...for friends...to satisify their sexual urges....love it.

Actually asking him into your life is as simple as that. During prayer, just admit that you know you're a sinner just like the rest of us, you know that Christ died to take the penalty for that from you and accept his free gift. That's salvation right there.    But you make an interesting point about inviting a stranger into your life. Once you've prayed as above, I suggest looking at more churches to find one you do get something out of. Personally, I find a Baptist services good. They make the message interesting and their tends to be a very upbeat tone. If you like contemporary music, they tend to be good at that. Of course, that's not the whole point, but it is a passionate method of worship, which is always good.

The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.

b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	There are many different theories about the origin of handedness, which is the preference for one hand over the other for certain motor skills. Division of labor is the most commonly accepted theory of handedness. The premise of this theory is that since both speaking and handy-work require fine motor skills, having one hemisphere of the brain do both would be more efficient than having it divided up. Also, if all functions were carried out in both hemispheres, the size of the brain and its energy consumption would increase, which is not affordable. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness would prevail.    In his book Right-Hand, Left-Hand, Chris McManus of University College London argues that the proportion of left-handers is rising and left-handed people as a group have historically produced an above-average quota of high achievers. He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently in a way that widens their range of abilities, and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centres of the brain.|`|4Vchxp32aa	because you are right handed or left handed for a reason:  it's your dominant side.|`|9PrsSL97aa	because your use to your right hand you just got to get use to your left hand!!|`|94NYYq5Haa	That's how your brain is organized

Tell the doctor that you want to be a vet and what your weaknesses in study are.  Maybe you will find a mentor who will put you in touch with a great tutor to help you academically.  Good luck.  You've got a great cause to fulfill.|`|100912340942b82743a18af1cb658391aa	Veterinary school is actually harder than medical school.  Have you thought of becoming a vet tech?  And the suggestion to volunteer is a great one.  Meanwhile, many shelters have so many pets to deal with that they have foster programs where the animals live in a person's home until a spot becomes available for them.  It's not easy emotionally, but if you think you can deal with it, it can be very rewarding.|`|4Vchxp32aa	I think all medicine deals with math so I don't know.

bGlZ8I2iaa	I second what Laura K said...  The depression affected the whole world and the economic situation in Germany helped Hitler's rise to power...he promised to 'fix it' for everybody...  He got there with the support of about 25% of the population...while 25% were terrified of him and 50% were apathetic and did nothing...    After he successfully disarmed the population, he had free reign to do as he pleased...the results? The Night of Terror...the invasion of Poland...the list just starts there...millions of dead world wide later, he offed himself...Have we learned anything from the experience?|`|4WPogYkKaa	It affected the whole worls, especially Germany, who was in a terrible economic condition due to the Treay of Versailles signed in 1918 at the end of WWI.

I have this guy friend, he's kinda out there. I'm shy and not. He's like, not the kind of guy that usually would hang out with a girl like me. Well we don't really hang out, but I'd still say we were friends. Anyways, he's done random stuff and given me random compliments that most people don't usually think to say anything about. He's always really nice when I'm sad and has always managed to cheer me up. He admitted to me that he liked me when we first met, but then we became friends and knew it was better like this. I have to say though, he's the only guy to have ever said anything like that to me. And I'm at the point where something like that shouldn't be a big deal. But it is. It gave me a good confidence boost, even though he may not know it. He's like the one person who's ever given me the confidence that I can do stuff, and that I'm special and pretty like the rest of the girls. I really appreciate having a friend like him.

I was immature, blind to things; I felt like I was something "special" in this world, my ego was VERY high.     As soon as I met the person I am now in love with, things changed.

Now, 2 years of being in love later, having conversations lasting for 2-3 hours, and opening up to one another; I still cannot predict their next move or sentence.

He is the only human I have ever met who is so accepting (which is why I prefer animals to humans).

BhumxInEaa	You are not thinking.    1. As you already know, to use cost-benefit analysis, you have to be able to cast both costs and benefits into comparable units - usually money.    What about all the cases where there is no natural way to do so? How do you evaluate the desirability of a new weapon system? or the ideal size for an army?    2. What about those cases where the monetary answer requires assumptions about _long_ term interest rates - when we know that over the long term interest rates are completely unpredictable?    3. What about those situations where monetary results are NOT considered the most important? There are many cases where people are (or claim to be) more concerned about other values and "morality". (Cost-benefit analysis says the death penalty doesn't pay. Clearly, that does not sway most of its advocates.)    None of this uses information that you didn't have when you asked the question. So why did you need to ask?

But I remember how sick I was before I found the right medication.  I heard voices and saw things that weren't there.  I know they weren't there because there's no such thing as red snake people trying to possess my soul.  The TV and radio talked directly to me.  I am very functional and I drive a car and socialize with friends, but I can't work because of the voices.

Sounds like you are looking for us to validate your prejudices.|`|IwUpusQiaa	i don't think this is likely, because you state feminists have a "hatred of males", which is false.    feminists are against abuse of any nature (especially if it is directed at someone because of their gender!!) feminists certainly don't prefer one sex over the other. they want equality, and to be free of gender stereotyping, so i would think they would want their children to grow up in a safe environment where they feel free to express themselves and learn about respect and fairness.    and my reasoning may not seem like reasoning, but you certainly don't provide any sources or show how you came to this conclusion. your theory is merely proof of your ignorance and bad judgment.|`|wgZVeLZPaa	Have you ever seen this to prove your assertion?

The answer there is to look at a variable other than political viewpoints and instead focus on mental stability.  In this regard, I don't think there is any support for the proposition that feminists are more mentally unstable than non-feminists.  Because I think mental instability is the root cause of most if not all spouse/child murders, I would say the answer is no.|`|vEj7xoBraa	you are 100% right.Feminists hate men so in order to make their boys fail they will brainwashed them in to thinking that they will never be good at anything because of them being males.|`|gb9ERmHPaa	I agree, I know some females are gonna be mad that you posted this but you are 100% right.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I have seen neither of these theories play out in reality when the mother actually calls herself a feminist.|`|xCd7m5dkaa	There not likely abusive.

I've heard of moms who do stuff like making their son make his sister's bed so he will learn that girls aren't there to serve him. I guess they didn't realize they were teaching their sons that men are servants for women, and their daughters that women don't have to be responsible for themselves. How sad for both kids!! And there are also a few who, as you say, make their boys feel guilty for being male. But I'm pretty sure moms like that are the minority.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I know a man who beat the **** out of his son and molested his daughter, was he actually a feminist?    My Mamma's stepmother beat her and her brother both equally...was she an anti-feminist?    I really don't think feminism and abuse go hand in hand. Abusers believe in all sorts of things.    Both of these people were pretty religious, so were those family members who turned a blind eye to the abuse, both genders. Does that mean Catholics are all abusive and condone abuse?    Doubt it. They were just crappy people to ignore it, and obviously kinda evil people who actually were the abusers.    Evil abuses, nothing more, nothing less. Then it's just varying degrees of it. To me, at least.    For you, maybe all feminists are evil and this would explain it. But then how do you explain non-feminists being abusers? Gets dicey then, eh? =o/    ** If others do it who aren't feminists, then how can you peg feminist Mothers as being pretty guaranteed to abuse their children in one of those two ways?     Seems like you yourself are admitting it has little to do with feminism and everything to do with someone being a crappy parent.     If not, then you're not making yourself all too clear =o/|`|lJYvGLKLaa	Feminists do not hate males. Ugh.

t0mb150gaa	1. too many jobs going over seas- we can fix this by keeping our products at home and buying our parts and labour at home..match the costs of going overseas to keep them in america.  2. our welfare system- we teach dependency rather then responsibility make these people who are on the system work through cleaning highways and job placement programs to get there monthly income.  3. taxes- instead of giving tax breaks to big companies and the poor we need to recover the middle class and small business.  4. over seas funding-we need to start fixing our own economy before we can start to help other countries.  5. Immigration-we need to make it harder for immigration to preserve jobs and stop giving them so much money to start off when entering our country. Start taking care of our own first  6.credit card companies-we need to put a freeze on interest rates and the amount these companies can charge .  Hope this helps|`|vkIkFgqiaa	Wow.    1.Gas prices through everything off.  2.The war is part of it.  3.Everyone thinks the economy is bad so people cut back on things.  4. Immigration=less jobs.  5. more people are moving closer to the city, causing house prices to go down.    You could probably think of ways to fix these. Here are a few ideas.    1. fix gas prices by making fuel efficient cars.   2.gradually end the war.   3.um  4. um  5.um  You think of some! Some people aren't saying reasons the economy is so bad. they're giving things that happened when the economy went bad.|`|su37vnIXaa	Well stocks are down, the housing market is doing poorly & houses are worth less, the war is expensive,|`|TK4Tj9FPaa	I'm not sure but your avatar's hair is funky|`|I6dcRgD6aa	(1) unemployment  (2) high prices  (3) cost of war  (4) greed from CEO's  (5) credit card co. charges  sorry you have to get others to help you American Idol is on, bye|`|S3hnj0Ocaa	1.)

mCAWxobNaa	A fair number of them are lesbians but that's not the reason they hate men.  In fact, I don't think that the majority necessarily hate men now, but their doctrine, i.e. their bible is, indeed, predicated on the hatred of men and achieving Supremacy over men.  In time ALL Feminists will hate men.  It's a matter of time until they do, but not all of them hateman right now; I genuinely think there are some who don't get hate men.|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	No    They don't hate men either|`|svOneExjaa	LOL.

zIqfIIlMaa	The root of the gender war and why it will not end too soon, is the perception. Perception that men favor women while oppressing.   They don't.     With scant resources, monetary and otherwise, the competition has been mounting ever since the first cohabitation were established on the banks of Severn. Women have been spared that competition for thousands of years until recently. There are always many men to stand up between dangers and a woman.     Now with the forced abandonment of that benevolent sexism, along with its malevolent part of course, women will face more and more tougher competition. One which men have always faced.     This simple truth seems to escape cantankerous feminists and they keep on fueling this divisive fire.|`|H55nCLqPaa	There is definitely an element of vengefulness in modern feminism, there probably always has been.    For the record, if we're going to argue about which sex has behaved better throughout history, then I'll accept that is has to be women. However the idea that women somehow had a harder time would be utterly laughable if it wasn't so widely held to be true. It's the everyman who is truly oppressed, always has been, always will be.|`|0w5Apf1naa	More evidence of feminism being a supremacy movement.|`|RuLPI7CEaa	Men being forced to go to war against aother men is somehow an easy life? Ever watch a war movie?   Slaving away at a hard and extremely dangerous job is easy?  Have you ever worked in extreme temperatures, doing manual labor?  If it's so easy why don't more women demand jobs building sky scrapers or working in coal mines? Men die earlier because they are willing to work the more hazardous occupations.      What easy llife? Only a few that make it in politics or born wealthy?  Haven't these men always shared their assets with some woman? Why do women control more money than men?    No, I don't agree with such foolish assertions and don't believe you do.|`|yiHsLtPdaa	Without a doubt.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	Actually, I've thought that after all the years of women being supported , protected , cared for and how easy they have had it , that really men should be entitled to some sort of reparations.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	Red herring argument, quote without context, generalization from a particular, redefinition of already accepted terminology for a rhetorical strategy the original definition already opposes.    You're just full of logical fallacies, aren't you?|`|qbelhflAaa	No, I don`t.|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	No|`|FL67UPPHaa	I don't agree with it -- I think both men and women were constrained by the norms of society, it wasn't a case of one gender oppressing the other. There were individuals who were abused or ill treated, but most people were happy with their lives in the context of the time. Women may not have had equal legal rights, but men have historically been the ones to have to fight and die to protect others.    I think the actions of feminism politically in recent times have shown that many feminists feel men should be punished for the actions of their ancestors that they probably don't even support. Affirmative action gives women preference over men in education and the workplace, and goes beyond equal opportunity. There have been measures to work towards having equal numbers of men and women in top jobs, which will inevitably mean women being given preferential treatment. Early feminism was about equal opportunity, the goals have changed a lot since then.|`|svOneExjaa	LOL. It is not a doctrine, but someones personal opinion. As an intelligent human being, I tend to question everything I read. I tend to listen to everyone,  but leave decision making to myself only.

kX3Kn7Cjaa	My best tip is alcohol.     Happy to hear that buspar helped you with your anxiety.   If you want to talk to people more, then just go ahead and do it! What's stopping you?     I used to be really shy, but most people would never know that today. I started pretending that I wasn't shy and after a while the shyness faded away. It was easier than I thought.     People are allways interested in talking about themselves. Just ask a bunch of questions and they'll think you're a great person. ;-)
THbIes2Baa	Hi, this is an awful thing of a fater to do, and i know you must have a horrrible time dealing with all of these things at your age. He doesnt classify as a fater for you. You get some men in this world that just dont care about some people and you are one of the unfortunate ones. Its not only you out there, and i know exactly what you're going through. Just hold on ok? If i were you, and i know this would be very hard for you, but i think it would be better for you to cancel him out of your life, and for your sister, ignore her as much as you can or dont let anything she sais get to you. You are the older sister, and before you know you'll be out of the house and starting your own life. Put all your attention and all of your mind into your schoolwork so you can be distracted from all of your family. Have fun at school with friends and instead of goin to your fathers house of something, ask some friends out to go see a movie with you or something. Try not to dwell on it too much.   Good luck young girl, my thoughts and prayers are with you.|`|P0RWV9Unaa	You're dad is screwed up.  I wonder if you remind him of your mother..  And therefor he is taking anger issues out on you.    If I were you I wouldn't attempt to visit him or anything.. Let him come to you.. And if he asks you what your problem is, I would bring this up to him.|`|a6JNx1tgaa	I know this might sound kind of extreme, but I think you should just forget about him entirely. He's got his own issues, obviously and if he's not willing to get help then you shouldn't have to put up with him. It's unfortunate, but we can't make people do what we want them to even if it's something they should be doing anyway.  My suggestion would be cut ties with him and get some counselling.    Hope things get better for you hun. (((hugs)))|`|vEp3qOUZaa	sucks for u D:|`|k7jInxBXaa	maybe it times to leave and forget about him|`|oOFeoP5raa	then you simply deal with the fact of not having a father figure.. if he doesnt want you around then dont do things to get his attention.. treat him like he is treating you.. just make sure in the future you dont repeat these actions with your children :)|`|MkXsrjy6aa	Well tell em how you feel... or 4get him|`|i7o1zE8Saa	Pray to the GOD all mighty :)|`|r1KTZBkraa	Talk to him about it.  he probably doesnt even realize that he is.

If you can't get it worked out and you need to talk, give this old Veteran a holler and we'll chat a while !|`|94NYYq5Haa	Dads are people, too.

My father loved my sister and never really paid attention, but now that I am older I can see the error of his ways. Be the better person and ask if you can come along or try to be more involved. He may feel Nicole is having a hard time with things and since you are older, you can handle it. You need to talk to him and be honest. That's the only way to fix things. Keeping them in is a way of making things worse.|`|SoFeInwKaa	Maybe its because she little, you need to show him that your more important. Tell him how you feel. Good Luck Girlie.|`|Gsfp1tEEaa	sorry to hear|`|aA8qw6Dgaa	Thats slack.|`|mhp7JKMNaa	tough answer.  he might only be doing it to make your mom upset..|`|bIhyeMJVaa	get therapy.  Now.|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	it's okay just find of other father figure like a grandfather or an uncle|`|SHGGkgdhaa	Maybe you should talk to him, tell him how you feel how you are being left out. Ask if you can come over, find common interests. If that doesn't help, then I am really sorry. I have tons of friends who's parents are divorced and it's always hard. I hope for the best.|`|B1OwJVjFaa	Let him know how you feel.  Don't yell, but be firm.  If he is any kind of a father at all, he will understand.  He is probably doing it subconsciously and may not even know that he is favoring.  Without more info, I really can't say more than that.|`|N0hlErEyaa	hes mean hes probably just choosin favorites dont worry hell get over nicole and eventually start favorin u! try tlkin to him about it|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	you know he's horrible to you, don't expect anything.  easier said than done! don't let anyone, no matter who they are, tear your worth away.  this is what makes us STRONGER people, this is what develops perservance and wisdom.    learn what you can from this horrible situation and use it to better your life. stop expecting, cause you're not going to get anything from him but you can change...thats whats you have control over.|`|5e4GkRP1aa	Trust me he does love you, but maybe he regrets not getting to spend as much time with Nicole as he did you. Divorce is wicked hard on everyone it will get better. confront him in a gentle way and see how it goes. never hurts to try.|`|yDtB0RpDaa	maybe you should speak to your sister nicole and then she will include you when they are doing things together... i'm very sorry to hear that but you are extremely lucky to have a dad and get a chance to make things better...  try to bond with him and do things he likes and then go into things you like =].... spend time with your mom too because you don't want to lose connection w/ her while your paying too much attention to your dad.     i hope this helps =]|`|fhyYh3Dzaa	It's hard to say because I don't really know the situation, but does your Dad know how you feel? Things get really messy in a divorce and I know from my own experience how messed up a relationship between a child and a parent can get.    I think that you should talk to your Dad, and tell him how you feel. Let him know that you would like to spend more time with him and that you feel left out when he always does things with your sister and not with you. Let him know that you feel like your missing out on a Father figure. Most likely, he will do everything that he can to fix that and spend more time with you.|`|sT1lb9mmaa	I'm sorry to hear about what's going on.  Perhaps, talking to your mother about it would help or even a school counselor. Divorces can be rough (trust me, I know) and there's always going to be hardships.  I think the best advice would be to talk to your dad about it. Tell him don't feel like you have a father. You feel like your excluded and it's not a very nice feeling. Try to stay calm, and be reasonable. Although I dont know you or your father personally, I assume that your father really does love you and he'll understand what you tell him.|`|pZixdGFiaa	That really sucks. My mom and her sister were like that and her sister only says that it's because she knew how to "play" their dad and my mom was the stupidly honest one. It's really sad that some families are like that, but that's life. Know that you make life what you want it to be, even if you have to wait until you're older.    You have a father figure, but it's a bad one. Don't internalize his cruelty. I've seen daughters of mean people either get with jerks or become one to their kids. Make a better life for yourself, and endure your life with your father. Keep loving him and know that he has a problem. Maybe one day, you'll be able to communicate your issues with him. Perhaps in a letter, since you wouldn't have to be there if he gets angry. But right now, since you have to live with him, bringing it up to him could make things worse. Maybe you need a mediator, someone to help you talk to him who is outside of the issue, but not your mom. Use your best judgment and good luck.

It doesn't really help that there are still a lot of immigrants coming into the US and the UK and people feel threatened by this. But if people want to be small minded and very prejudice, then let them. At the end of the day it is them who sit and complain about not having a job, then finding a scapegoat to blame it on, rather than actually getting off their lazy behind and try to get a job. They just sit in their house, shouting racist remarks at the television and waving their BNP flags.   I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."|`|WxqeMSw7aa	The problem is we both got nice countries with good Social handouts, and our government just loves giving our hard earned to immigrants. We aren't particularly racist, just stick to your own country and we'll be friendly enough when we come visit you.|`|AA10034255	Neither, you are making a common mistake of extrapolating to a large group from the actions of a very small minority.|`|kzkrll3Xaa	lol they arent you must be hanging with the wrong crowd man.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	I think it's just the majority of people who answer questions|`|4426582303692fa8410a0ca12979ceb7aa	It's getting better as the old folk die off.|`|N2PcehV4aa	Both populations live in cultures where political correctness has gone mad.

Very rarely (in Britain anyway) do you come across a truly racist person.|`|YABmMZ7xaa	well i dunno. depends how you look at it. I think alot of english people r getting pissed off with gettin on a bus and not knowing if their in england or africia! its not a colour thing, its a culture thing, because different cultures have their own norms, and i think england is finding it hard to know what our norms are anymore, because it seems anything goes depending on what culture your from. like a white guy grinds on me in a club i think ok bit wierd..and black guy does it and its typical, again not racist, its about knowing culture. and to be honest im pissed off with being called racist! because im not, i believe human beings are human beings, in that respect i am colour blind. but i know what culture is, and if i dont like how a country operates, im entitled to that opinion.   i cant speak to the US because im from UK.   Im also half polish, i have been told since birth than i need to date white european men. just like a muslim needs to find another muslim, or a cathlic with a cathlic, most asains are not aload to date white girls or boys, but nah that ent racist, yet if i said i would not date a black man...im racist. well bollox!|`|FKwwByvEaa	people who have strong opinions about a certain situation or question are more likely to get involved or answer so you may get a skewed point of view that is not necessarily representative of the population at all.

YwE5kIB8aa	I Realize your reacting to a pretty crappy question, but being more traditional myself but I would say the same as Mr Van H.  The idea of killing any kid let alone my own just disgusts and infuriates me.  Like that piece of sh it in Germany or Holland who knifed those babies in the day care.  Just 5 minutes alone with him, is what i'd like.  I hope there's a hell so he can go and burn!|`|V1MptCMiaa	i don't think all traditional men feel fine killing their wives and kids, and I don't think most men see their family members as inferior. But, yes, it does happen more with men than with woman.|`|vEj7xoBraa	I would ask the same question about women.Women don't believe in equality either. so would they kill every male just because they(women) thought we're inferior?|`|6H1ie8WXaa	No they're not. I disagreed with his question by the way.|`|zCxRUFRCaa	Christian, maybe you should extend a little bit of that equality to the rest of your fellow humans?    You seem to absolutely adore people      .....      who are exactly like you.|`|FL67UPPHaa	You're confusing traditional men with abusive men. Abusive men attack their wives and children. Traditional men are the men who believe in working hard to support their family, sticking around to take responsibility and treating women with courtesy. I'm not sure where you got the idea that traditional people don't believe in equality or think women are inferior -- I certainly don't see myself as inferior.    I didn't agree with the other question either though, so I can see where you're coming from. Feminists can be good mothers/wives, and traditional men can be good fathers/husbands. A person's political views, unless they are very extreme, don't affect their parenting skills. It's sad that cases of abuse are used to fuel agendas.|`|rD5HyZyeaa	If someone believes you are less than human, they can do anything to you.|`|DRwpshcYaa	This is the dumbest question I have ever read... hahahah  You know NOTHING of what a "traditional" man is... so let me educate you. A traditional man opens a door for a lady, brings flowers on the first date, takes care of his family (i.e. wife and kids), and ensures that everyone in his family is taken care of... oh yea.. we also don't have "baby mama's", peeps, homies, and never, and I mean NEVER use the term "know what i'm sayin"|`|jKIBBgsQaa	In my opinion, you are looking at the wrong variable in deciding who is more likely to kill a spouse or child.  Instead, the question is mental stability in the person.  I would imagine that it would be hard to show that statistically, the average man who has a wife and kids, works hard every day, comes home to a dinner on the table, etc. is more likely than others to be mentally unstable.  So I would say, no, a traditional man is not more likely to kill his spouse or child.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	They, traditional men, can no longer feel guilty for having the right to legally beat and or kill their wives in the past that has been disproven. So, this is, also, about suggesting to the wives of these men their husbands are incaple of loving them and they don't deserve that love.|`|cCKASg4Waa	Nope.    Did it ever occur to you that many women prefer traditional men?    I didn't know that chivalry and letting the man "wear the pants" in the family had anything to do with murder. You sure have a twisted way of thinking.    And as Blue Christian said, the links you provided in no way suggested whether the men were "traditional" or not. Maybe you should go to school and learn how to back up an argument like an intelligent, rational human being. That makes as much sense as me posting random articles of women commiting crimes and then asking if feminists are more likely to commit crimes, even though the articles never stated whether or not they were feminists.    For the record, I am not a "traditional" male, but there may be certain traditional facets that I adhere to (like most guys). People usually aren't easily defined as black & white.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Nope.     My husband is traditional and he believes in equality. He doesn't see me, his traditional wife, as inferior in any way and he treats me like a lady. He's a great husband.    Your premise is flawed. And those links say nothing about whether these men are "traditional" or not. Nice attempt to demonize traditional men as soulless killers who have no love for their families.    Whatever, Trevor. If you want me to respect you, then earn it. Mmmkay? I've been nothing but civil to you and you've done nothing but harass and insult me, going so far as to be happy for what happened last year.|`|94NYYq5Haa	Traditional men don't necessarily view women as "inferior" in the sense that you are suggesting.    Many believe that women should be "protected."    So, no.  Faulty reasoning.|`|oZPLI8Y5aa	You equate traditional duty with feelings of superiority. That is often not the case.  Many believe that it is their duty to their belief to carry out such acts and they feel remorseful. That , however, does not stop them.     On the other hand some do reflect your views. The problem is that this question is quite general in scope.
7h5zhoJqaa	A very generalized answer, but the Soviet Union was the first, following the Bolshevik Revolution that overthrew the Russian Monarchy in a bloody takeover that left the royal family dead.  After this point, much of the USSR was secured, but a civil war still took place between 1918-1921 to take control of all of Russia, and the Bolsheviks obviously prevailed.  Lenin then started instituting the philosophy of Karl Marx, in his own flavor, but it took many years to complete.      The USSR and it's stable communist economy wasn't established until Stalin's rule.  Lenin had created a 10-15 year plan and died after only 3.  Stalin took another 4 years after Lenin's death to consolidate control of power, taking Lenin's socialist model and adding his very murderous, controlling touch.  Thus, the socialist revolution in the USSR took longer than initially expected, and continued into the late-1930's with much resistance and turmoil, though obviously fruitless for the opposition.      The Soviet Union emerged as a stable, industrialized country right before WWII.  They were a powerful force in the war, and they were integral in defeating Nazi Germany.      And that's when communism spread.  With the Nazis, Italy and Japan toppled following World War II, the USSR emerged as a major world power matched only by the US.  Not realizing the ramifications that would pop up just a few years later, the US and the European allies agreed to let the Soviets take control of rebuilding Eastern Europe, and take control they did  - in their authoritarian communist model.    They had also embarked into China and North Korea on the eastern front of World War II.  They helped Mao take over the Chinese government and form the PRC in 1949, and also helped establish the crazy government that we see in North Korea, as well.      Other countries with poor governments and high poverty in the third world saw the model of the USSR and PRC and rebel movements formed to overthrow governments (many with Chinese or Soviet support) to create a system where everyone was provided for - hence Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Cuba, etc.  1/3 of the world was under Communist control by the 1980's.  Not many today, with even China now capitalist, though still authoritarian.

Google "central bottleneck theory" and "psychological refractory period."      Actually, people can't really write and talk at the SAME time.  This theory tries to explain why.  attention is basically the answer|`|20qcBww0aa	I never knew that... but its just like this one right here. Move your arm clockwise, after like 5 seconds then try moving you leg counter-clockwise while moving your hand clockwise. I don't think it's possible.|`|npIdAW3Yaa	actually it's very hard but if your ambidextrous{meaning you can do two different things at the same time using both hands} if your right handed then when you write you are only using the right side of your brain at that time same with lefty's. So it is possible but you must practice and have a lot of patience to do it. Hope i helped! Good Luck!

pENe9jsnaa	To dream that you transfer planes, implies an important transitional phase in your life which will take you away from your intended path. These changes will take you to new directions and new heights of status and recognition.    To dream that a plane crashes, suggests that you have set overly high and unrealistic goals for yourself. Your goals may be too high and are impossible to realize. You are in danger of having it come crashing down. Alternatively, your lack of confidence, self-defeating attitude and self-doubt toward the goals you have set for yourself is represented by the crashing airplane; you do not believe in your ability to attain those goals. Loss of power and uncertainty in achieving your goals are also signified.|`|1hRMJiBwaa	well  all the indications in this dream you are having are all pointing to one of two things ,which one that is?, only you can decide.  the first is that you need to chillax a bit and take up a creative hobby,  the second is that you just plain out suck at every thing and are a raging homosexual and that the best thing you could do is eat some glass and poop blood for a week or two to punish your self for no apparent reason.    jesus saves! : )
AA11148143	A lot. But most of it seems to stem from the fact that we exported too many jobs overseas, and now people don't have enough purchasing power, so recession is the result. I think that's the basic problem.|`|AA11155064	Almost a century of blind faith and ignoring obvious lessons has been found unwise.    Decades of successive administrations in both governments and private industry believed credit could be eternally created without any underpinning value or product. Creditors and debtors responsibilities to ensure full debt repayment finalisation were absolved. In pursuit of ever increasing profits, the credit proffering greedy exploited the gullible unsophisticated debtor needy until all lost sight that debts HAVE to be paid. With enough credit given that there wasn't enough money to repay debts: -- eventually no-one got paid.     Lessons from the 1890's, the 1930's, the 1970's, 1987, 1998 were unlearned. Lessons from the creation of Third World Debt were unlearned. Having exhausted Third World lending options, First World industry and corporations were fed to exhaustion, then private citizens until breaking point: now.    Greed depends on hope and ignores the safety of intelligence.  Intelligence acknowledges hazard and demands a safety net/ parachute/ not leaping before entering an abyss.    Now governments are attempting economy rescues by advancing as yet unearned taxes (i.e. Credit) to salve a past, support a present, and possibly promise a future.  Tax backed credit provision works because the terms with the debtor (taxpayer) are non-negotiable, non-relinquishable, variable to circumstance needs of creditor (government), eternaly extended until paid and totally obligatory (successors have honouring obligations).  For governments to default on loans would depend on corrupt administration and/or failure of supporting society. In this scenario the descent into tribalism and much changed community structure. (which would be mega resisted) mere survival would surmount payment obligations (but not erase them).    In the near term (circa a decade) expect constrained-to-harsh times as fixit measures are resisted and attempted to be subverted by the arrogant and ignorant greedy not wanting to relinquish their prior status.  Don't expect a lot in the interim: you won't be disappointed and immune to  the greater personal pitfalls.|`|3mEU4Apwaa	Basically, Id say, the problem is twofold. First, in the mid-00s the U.S. economy got badly unbalanced  too much dependence on housing and housing-inflated consumer spending, too big a trade deficit. This figure shows deviations in share of GDP  its the difference, in percentage points of GDP, between 2007 and average 1980-2000 spending on consumption (C), nonresidential investment (NR), residential investment (R), and net exports (NX). Notice that even with the housing collapse in progress, residential investment was still running a bit high  this year it will surely be well below normal. But the main thing at this point is high consumption offset by a high trade deficit.    Second, in the process we also got a credit bubble thats now bursting, and threatening to take down spending that wasnt all that high to begin with  like business investment.    What we want, and will eventually get, is a rebalancing: smaller trade deficits, consumer spending more in line with income, more normal housing spending. The trouble is in getting there.

The most terrible part was, he didn't really need it. He was a good sized lad, but he wasn't what I would call morbidly obese. In fact he was worried he wouldn't make the cut-off weight to qualify for it. I think it was like 100-150 .lbs over what they say was his " ideal " weight. Which giving his height and size, what they considered his " ideal " weight would have made him look like one of those extreme marathon runners. So he had the " band " surgery on a Monday morning and died in the ER waiting room that Friday night. All that the doctors could tell us, is they weren't sure what happened.|`|dYyiG90caa	Yes.

9PqgqYmzaa	It sounds to me like you're depressed. I know because I've been there. You are having trouble focusing because something is bothering you underneath and your mind is working hard to avoid it.    If you can't face whatever it is by yourself, it's really worth it to seek help. Try a school counselor, a clergyperson, a nurse, doctor, aunt or uncle, teacher, parent - someone you trust, who will listen without judging. Or ask your doctor to recommend a therapist.     I would not pay attention to people who put down therapy. It has helped me a great deal, and friends and relatives too.    Some depression is caused by a chemical inbalance in your body. It's nothing you've done, and isn't really connected to something that's happened in your life. It's just there, like having juvenile diabetes or poor eyesight. If you couldn't see well, wouldn't you go to an eye doctor and get glasses? So if you don't feel well, it makes sense to get help so you can get better.    Also get a complete medical checkup from a regular doctor, just to be sure you don't have a problem with thyroid or whatever.|`|fijYOZg1aa	Maybe you think too much and worry too much, and the people you meet on a daily basis are constantly feeding you negative emotions.|`|yLQ5b5Rmaa	u must have gone through something traumatic or some repeated situation where you felt helpless and unhappy on repeated basis.   that is normally lead to what you described.    seek help, but try to find someone who will listen to you and direct you how to help yourself and not someone who just listen and gives pills. people would spend a fortune on such ''therapy'' and become dependable. get your parents to help out.  i would not dismiss chemical imbalance, but still i believe whatever you do it should empower you not make rely on any source of treatment.|`|UtYOwE4Laa	you're developing depression.

Adults DO take things way to seriously... but it's due to the burdens of BILLS that come along with growing up.     Give a child bills, and watch them stop smiling.

Anything that promotes singing and dancing is going to raise endorphins, it's a natural anti-depressant.|`|8342eb2791b4f481bc2b31b4c0d0dbccaa	Is this a homework assignment?    IMHO, I am an adult, and I think it is young people who take themselves too seriously.  Have you ever seen them writing their "poor me" poems and having all sorts of "angst" about how deadly serious their most recent bf/gf breakup was?  It's like everything that they don't like is the total end of the world cuz it's "all about me"......  When you are an adult, you realize that you are really so small and all of those little things really don't matter.  You are free to relax and you don't care what people think anymore.  So anyway, I disagree with the first statement.    How do you define "pop" music?  If you mean just a style, like hip hop or screamo or something, why would that have a negative effect on anyone?  Musical taste is simply a personal preference.  However, when you are talking about lyrics that degrade people, like calling women b***** and using drugs and violence, then those types of lyrics should not be broadcast via FCC.  This is not a violation of free speech, as they can still say that women are b***** whenever they want, they just can't broadcast it over the public airways.|`|AA10263916	There are times when indeed some adults do take themselves very seriously because we are bogged down with very serious ordeals in life . I have taken the initiative to remember to live , laugh and love. However, I do have the side of me that is always motivated and gets the job dob done -- nothing funny about that.       The Ever so contreversial theory of music  lyrics.   I am an old metal head , proffessional person that made it through the past 40 years without  biting the heads off of bats and without  carrying a gun to school and killing my classmates. Be aware that the music has changed  a bit , I know I am very aware of all genres of  music.   I have come to appreciate them all   including the  serious  classical  all the way to hip-hop. Everyones an artist these days.        Should the lyrics be banned ----- that s dependant upon the parent- child (age of course)  relationship and decision as per their own  situation . Each household runs a little differently.   I don't feel it should be banned from all.  If you don't like it don't buy it.  There is parental advisory.|`|64eba52b7a7dcdb30b1e7b1223d7eb33aa	I agree that adults have made their adult world far too complex, we don't trust because we are better liers when we get older, because we can't trust we develop a sophisticated reference of knowledge on who to trust an who not to trust and in what circumstances, it just gets very very complex, so this causes us to less happy which then causes us not to laugh.   Popmusic, in my opinion, it can have a detrimental effect for the wrong person, but for most of us we seem to just listen to it and recall a situation in which that music applies to our every day life. I think though some popmusic is clearly designed as social engineering excercises though, it's kind of the glue of the ingnorant and decadent, so as to keep there miserable depraved existence alive. and feel that they have to conform to a social class that does'nt really exist, but ultimately it has no substance to most of it.|`|56f5f8ae1e7bc88b7fd1825ee9a14126aa	on the pop music topic (i have replied in a previous message to the first with the adults):  Culture seems to have lost its appeal among teenagers. Classical music is actually the real music, it's art. Pop music is sometimes nothing more than a horrible racket. Check out the reaction of animals to it - they don't like it. It's noise to their ears. The rebellious attitude of their favorite stars (pop singers) is imitated by teenagers and they end up with a very rebellious, sometimes inesthetic look and dress style. The drug taking habits and crazy lifestyle of the singers is also imitated and that is simply wrong. However, if the teenagers just listen to pop music and doesn't affect their attitude and lifestyle then it's ok... This too is a phase that shall pass, we all go through this...|`|AA11594273	I believe that with the first statement referring to adults taking life so serious is really society pressuring everyone to believe that by a certain age you should have A,B, or C accomplished in your life and are often told to "grow up".  Younger children don't have to be concerned with all the small details of everyday "adult" life so it is easier for them to laugh and enjoy more.  I live everyday full of life and I stay in touch with my inner child because that is one thing society will never dictate to me.  As far as pop music influencing today's youth, I am having mixed feelings about that.  Most people know the difference from right and wrong and if they choose wrong how can they blame it on a song that was written and played over the airways?  Basically, we all have choices in life and by the time we reach a certain age...we should all know what is expected of us to co-exist in harmony.|`|Ljekj08Waa	I dont think all adults are too serious, and I think sometimes younger people have prblems of thier own and dont laugh enough.   As for pop music having a bad influence on young people I dont think thats true. Some pop music is fun and puts you in a good mood. All types of music though have bad artists that are a bad influence, but I think rap is way worse than pop. Some rap artists are teaching our youth that cussing is cool and women have no value. I dont think any type of music should be banned, instead just artists or songs that have a bad influence on people.|`|AA10497619	These topics are those of an opinion, I could agree or disagree on each of these topics. One could say that many adults dont take themselves seriously enough, or that music is a form of entertainment not of lifestyle and culture.

vqZD2TzLaa	That is a vexed question.  Although all humans are of the same species and are, for all "practical" purposes, the same each varies from every other member of the species in some way, e.g., fingerprints, ear shape and size, DNA, etc.  The same is true for all species.  That is the basis for evolution.  If it were not for genetic variation within a species, it would die off as it would be unable to adapt adequately to the changing environment.|`|bYmmwviQaa	No - Short and Sweet,Everyone is Different In Different Ways In The Same Way Where All Similar That's What Makes them Them|`|dgQ4MciGaa	Depends on the wazzitz.

Species which reproduce asexually, which usually occurs in single cell organisms such as bacteria and algae which reproduce through binary fission where the cells split in half, are all exactly the same.|`|5fw5fzOeaa	they can but it doesn't matter a species is usually defined as a population of organisms that can get it on in the wild and can produce viable offspring. for organisms that don't reproduce sexually they just have to look a lot alike and have a comin ancestor    for example I am the same species as you despite having a different hair color|`|HuhqPNTzaa	no?|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Uh, no.

edycn5ggaa	Economics is defined as a science of scarcity. We live in a world of unlimited wants but limited resources. Therefore, we need to figure out ways in which we can efficiently allocate resources to fit the social needs of people.|`|AA11906309	First I believe you mean scarcity. (Typo with s and a c?)    "People have unlimited wants but resources are limited. Because of scarcity, various economic decisions must be made to allocate resources efficiently."    "When we talk of scarcity within an economic context, it refers to limited resources, not a lack of riches. These resources are the inputs of production: land, labor and capital.    People must make choices between different items because the resources necessary to fulfill their wants are limited. These decisions are made by giving up (trading off) one want to satisfy another."|`|3p6wp7DYaa	Because that is the defining factor in all of our economic decisions. If there were unlimited resources, everyone could consume freely and endlessly, there would be no need to devise an economic system or a way to distribute everything fairly among a population.    The reason people started to think about economics is because of scarcity. How to distribute the amount of food available to a community among the people who are hungry, how to divide the land, who should own what and why, etc.
8e0116579f8b9dc10ee65bb0ba1bc5a6aa	Close, but not exactly.    Be clear whether you are speaking about Gestalt perceptual psychology or Gestalt therapy.    Gestalt therapy is grounded in Gestalt perceptual psychology (which, basically, recognized that people perceive 'wholes') ... but is far more than a theory of perception.    It's a different way of looking at the world.    Look here:    http://www.gestaltcleveland.org/about.ph...    ... under "Approach to Learning"    Hang in there ... Gestalt theory is difficult to put into words. :-)

fL8CIA2Xaa	Life is more than just sports, find something else you like doing, apply your self to your studies, Friends come and go, plan for your future|`|igI5yX0vaa	You should do sports again.  The activity will be good for you.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	If you are serious about killing yourself, call a suicide hot line. If you are not serious, then you should still seek out some counseling to help you get through this rough patch.     Sitting around and hating on yourself isn't going to fix the problem. Every stage of life passes to the next, and we can't stay stuck in high school forever. I sense you are grieving over the great old days when the world was your oyster.    Doing nothing won't change much, so get up and make that call and talk to someone about where you are and start thinking about what you can do next. Good luck.|`|ZyXpGLl4aa	Sports and "stuff" don't define you. Friends don't define you and even your family's opinion doesn't define who you are and render you worthy or worthless. Just wondering, what happened? Were your friends fake?  Did you grow out of them?    It would be helpful if you added this info.  Also, you do know that the pain it would cause everyone would be unfathomable.    You can e-mail me if you'd like.|`|nyylb6qUaa	Hey buddy. Not going too well? My heart goes out to you man. I have been wrestling with suicide for six years now. I am a loner. I have nobody to talk to. I have no friends, just a dead end job. I have no self-esteem at all. I trudge through life the best way that I can. Try, I know things look grim, but try. I am in the same boat. If you go through with it, you will be leaving me and the few others in the boat alone. Don't do this, I will be your friend. My e-mail is themark08@yahoo.com. God Bless, e-mail me any time.|`|R6pfYeioaa	DON'T DO IT!    Hey listen how do you expect to get any better when you end your life?  If you kill yourself people are going to think you are a loser.  Do you really want to die leaving the memory of people thinking your ba loser?|`|J3Kz3OSOaa	don't give up on your life!

However it is unrealistic. It would be best to seek help. I can tell you that you do not have to feel this way and there are answers. do not be afraid to get help! Best of luck.|`|Hlrs3aElaa	I felt like this for a long, long time. Actually talking to somebody you can trust with secrets is a great way to make things better. And I bet your friends are wanting the old friend that they had, and they are waiting to help you with your troubles.(that's what happened to me.)  I kept skating while I was in the lower points of my life and it kept me alive. Take up some activity; art, darts, swimming, dancing to your favorite music, anything to keep you out of the dark hole you are in.    There is a light at the end of this dark era you are in, keep going to get out of it, because life is worth it!  
jEZbYZwMaa	It's a tie between tension and awkwardness. Awkwardness is the pinnacle of my existence. Lucky me. Hate it. Not much more to say for that one. Then I also hate tension. I hate having that wretched feeling in your stomach and no matter what you trick yourself into thinking.. it just doesn't go away. See I'm a strange kind of person; I hate being afraid. Yet I'm afraid of everything. I hate physical pain.. that would have been my number one but it's not really an emotion. Anyway I hate tension because I'm more of a cynical type person and I hate that I can have such intelligent thoughts but at the same time act like a child when it comes to pain like that. So tension makes me so angry because I already feel stupid for being so scared of pain and then to top it off I'll shy away from any courses that potentially include tension just because I'm so scared of it. But yeah those are my least favorite emotions :)|`|na9nG47zaa	awkwardness too. I've always been really good at coping with embarrassment. being awkward is terrible! its so weird when youre just standing there kinda nodding your head like, "SOOOOO," and there are people just standing there too, saying nothing in complete awkward silence. anything else i can really handle but im with ya on being awkward!|`|TK4Tj9FPaa	Sadness|`|6jXuUCdraa	sadness kind of sucks..|`|os43UNvqaa	Grief.

When you have that kind of sad thought, and memories of happy times, even though they were so happy it's almost as if you want to go back but you can't. And melancholy, when everything seems gray, and everything you do is useless and unneeded. and there's always this tinge of unhappiness in the atmosphere. Gahh! I hate sadness pretty much!|`|UYA1vrNPaa	anxiety/nervousness.    I hate it when you feel like you're going to get in trouble for something, or knowing that something is coming up, or just anything like it.|`|EmV1Kojyaa	Fear.

It is something that gives me an unbearable feeling of vulnerability, and nobody likes to feel vulnerable.|`|pVTevFJgaa	Hard to beat that one... it's horrible when you feel like you don't know what to do...    As well as fear and pain.|`|vMSzI5q4aa	*high fives*    awkwardness for sure!!|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Surprise.        My family has a history of heart problems, and that scares the h*ll out of me.

QcNkZxPaaa	flapper - a young woman of the period of World War I and the following decade who showed freedom from conventions (as in conduct)      To a flapper, the words shown in the cartoon convey them being typical and kept down. So ripping obsolete words shows that her role in society is to be free and do whatever she wants.|`|8a959069c9bfd621c3034f08c2890d59aa	She thinks that she has the right to rewrite the dictionary to suit her agenda...  She wants to change the world to her way of life.  She wants all women to act the way she does and she wants all men to let her act that way.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	She's saying that prudence, modesty, obedience, and the need for a woman to have a chaperon when going out are all outdated ideas for women.|`|NYU37jfGaa	The flapper was supposed to be very liberated and have a lot of fun, and do everything that boys did.   This girl would probably see her role as being fun-loving, sporty, and uninhibited.  And thin and flat-chested.  This was the ideal flapper.  Seriousness was out, fun was in.
f2cQrG7jaa	If you do anything ABOUT the situation then you will only justify your judgement on it. If you want the judgement to change then do nothing ABOUT it. Doing nothing about anything is just an idea, but not doing anything ABOUT something is something we do all the time. Did you do anything ABOUT that butterfly hanging out outside? About the grass being green?     It's a choice, are you willing to choose it?|`|J3Kz3OSOaa	Just tell some good friend you had a long time ago that moved away or something becuase then the school will not find out if you tell her maybe her school will but you dont know them so its not such a big deal!|`|NrOJ24hSaa	That is a good suggestion...if you have friend that lives far away that you know you can trust, try to tell them if you absolutely must tell someone. If you don't know anyone, you could always look into talking to a therapist that will help you with your problem but be able to listen at the same time. Good luck :D

srIMFTb8aa	Yes, I've noticed that!  My mother is a perfect example of this.  She's a highly successful real estate agent and brilliant at almost everything she puts her mind to, but in day-to-day life and human interactions, she's completely daft.  I'd give examples, except I'd be here all night and then I'd be too mad to sleep.    On the other side of the coin, when I worked with autistic and mentally retarded adults, they'd sometimes come out with really profound statements.    Because of this, I try to listen to people themselves, not their degrees or accomplishments.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	yes, absolutely!    many times (not always, but many times)........a person who has more degrees than a thermometer...........they are sooooo lacking in common sense and they lack knowledge in practical things.     maybe thats why they call PhD.'s "Poor Hopeless Dopes."|`|AXOVKAwbaa	I think I'm pretty intelligent, but I lack common sense.  My parents and siblings would get frustrated with me when I didn't understand something really simple, but I made such good grades in school.|`|pYimIJAWaa	Not being educated does not translate to not being intelligent, it could also be translated to 'not being interested', 'not having opportunities', 'not having the financial means', 'not having a teacher/parent/role model that showed the way to higher education', 'not being able to free one's self from other obligations', etc. and so forth. So, it is not at all surprising when someone who didn't go very far in school still has intelligent things to say about the world.     As for the educated people 'being extremely unintelligent about simple things' (and I say this with gentleness and kindness, and as someone with a fair amount of education), there is a special kind of person who does very well in academia, and usually a reason that he/she stays in academia. I've known many very intelligent people who are highly expert, and sometimes even world renowned in their fields, and have wondered how they manage to go grocery shopping, do their laundry and match their clothes each morning. Generally, I attribute it to a very patient spouse.    Intelligence does not always equate to common sense, but everyone has their own type of intelligence. The key is figuring out a niche where you might best use yours.|`|oCHaJc49aa	Uh, yes, sort of. What you are referring to is the difference between "knowledge" and "wisdom".    Knowledge is facts and so on.     Wisdom is the ability to use the facts you have well and thoroughly.     A knowledgable person can be quite unintelligent, though that is a small minority. We call them Yuppies.    A wise person almost always is highly intelligent. We call them bus drivers.    Bye the way, it is better for one's income to be dumb and well connected that clever and have no well-placed connections. It is better for one's ethical position to be clever and have no well-placed connections.    There's an old saying in the City in London which summarises your question rather wel:    If you are stupid, you have to be honest.    If you are clever, you can be corrupt; because if you are stupid and corrupt (we call them "bankers") you'll get caught (Bear Stearns, Lehman bros, etc etc).    The best business is the one that is clever and honest. If you ever find one, please let me know.|`|eBMKmgCjaa	The classic example of this is a woman who gets a PhD in Women's Studies but talks about life as if she is on at totally different planet to everyone else. This kind of 'education' is no use to anyone except the people who make money from spreading feminist ideas in the media, law courts etc      But it really doesn't take a genius to see right through these people. Of course most people are afraid to say what they think because the will be accused of misogyny, and because nobody likes a misogynist people just clam up rather than lose all their friends.|`|ynjrtIdUaa	Of course - everyone has their areas of interest where they excel.|`|TZeKta4haa	know one is perfect and everyone is smart in their own little way!!!|`|AHpS6qPDaa	My dad always called it book smarts versus street smarts(aka common sense)    I've noticed this a lot over the years.  Some people study hard, get the degree and get that 6 fig salary yet they are completely dense on simple, every day issues.  Other people don't go to school, go to poor paying jobs and live mediorce lives yet have the most brilliant thoughts.     It'd be interesting to find out what is the reason behind this.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Oh yes.  There's a difference between book smarts and common sense.  It's always good to have equal amounts of both.
AHpS6qPDaa	Both sexes get it bad. The media wants to pin us against each other. It boosts their ratings and of course the money they make.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Women.

Men in the media:    Incompetent morons who can't wash their own clothes or cook dinner without burning the house down    Dirty pigs whose idea of cleaning is to sweep everything under the bed.    Complete whores who don't care about where they stick their penises      Women in the media:     Controlling harpies who control their husband's every move    Happy housewives    Miserable career women (since, y'know, God forbid a woman LIKE to work)    Insecure whiners with weight issues.      So, whichever is worse is purely up to you
cHaRg3fkaa	In Canada, like the US, we have decided to invest heavily in "shovel projects" to stimulate the economy and repair rapidly deteriorating infrastructure (roads, bridges, sewers, etc.).  Two months ago, the forecast was for a $100 million federal surplus (more revenue than expenses), than 30 days before the budget was tabled, a $30 billion deficit!  And then when the budget was tabled last week a $60 billion deficit.  My ADM said a week before budget tabling that if the Dept of Finance got a dime for every shovel they will put in the ground, there wouldn't be a deficit!    So what's the downside of infrastructure investment in a downturn?  If they invest stupidly by repairing infrastructure everywhere without examining the necessity (return) of the investment against other investments, a lot of money will be wasted in repairing infrastructure in areas (projects) within the country that don't or won't contribute/benefit from the investment when the economy heats up down the road.  Secondly, let's say the recession or downturn goes on for a year, or  two.  It takes a lot of time (e.g., going to tender by describing the work to be done, selecting the right bid) and a lot of studies (environmental assessments, zoning law changes, right of way changes, etc.) before the shovels hit the ground.  By then, the downturn may be an upturn and the opportunity cost of infrastructure might be prohibitive compared to the alternatives.|`|JgFkmif9aa	The main downsides of increases in government spending are a decrease in private investment (known as the "crowding out" of investment) and an increase in the national debt.|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	Wow! You ask a lot of questions.  Anyways, there is nothing that can be done. Not all Americans are getting one including our family that is middle class. I don't see how that works. The money needs to be spent building our cities, roads, bridges, schools, and towns. Giving money out to buy crap at the mall ins't good. What does that teach? Nothing.    Government spending would go up as the national debt would increase. Already over one trillion dollars and rising. Obama can't fix it. The economy can't be fixed that easily as there are so many different things going on.

I guess you can look at it as being shy but most of it is being compassionate. If you boost or exclaim about an achievement or goal you reached, it makes MOST feel like they cant reach their goals. Sure, they might say they are happy for you, but how can you know for sure?    Compassionate people do not boost, and do not brag about things in their life. They realize that everyone has lived in different situations and therefore are open or closed to certain attributes of life.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Those positive attributes were adapted from other people. She synthesized what she liked about what other people express. She might be shy for a million and a half reasons. Personally my confidence conflicts with my idea of what a person SHOULD do.

Having someone else responsible for your happiness is a powerless position.|`|ZyXpGLl4aa	"No man/ woman is an Island"|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Well, sometimes things CAN make you feel happy, at least for a little while. I have a gold pocket watch that belonged to my late husband. It makes me feel happy to look at it and hold it and think of him. Many times things are symbols for us and as such can make us feel good (or bad).    People cannot make us happy or unhappy. We might feel happy when we are with them, but it isn't the same thing. Whatever causes those feelings is something that comes from within us, they just are. Otherwise, we could force people to care for us just by doing nice things for them. Anyone who reads YA realizes that lots of people are crushing on other people who don't even know they are alive, or who treat them badly.    What really makes a person happy is getting to know yourself and doing those things that make you feel good about yourself. That is something that no one else can give you. It also makes one feel happy to give something back to the people we love, and those who have done for us, and even doing good works for people we don't even know.    It means respecting yourself and taking care of yourself and not allowing other people to treat you badly all the time. Yes, there are tough times in everyone's life. No one is ever happy all the time.    People who are happy inside of their own skin are not dependent, even if they make a lifetime commitment to another person through marriage and parenthood. Hope this answers your question.|`|3764eb0a1b8f6b2b731972d6d2120bdcaa	No, it makes you human.|`|cRlOQFj8aa	yes it does. But thats ok to be dependent because being dependent is human nature.

When I was young, my attitude towrads sex was about as casul as it could get, and it had nothing to do with anything anybody had said to me.  I doubt anything you said to them would have worried them more than momentarily.|`|cRlOQFj8aa	you did, but that is not to say that you could of prevented it.    when you talk to someone, you will, no matter what, effect their life. Every situation and every event that happens in your life turns you into who you are now. So its not the matter of you turning them into sluts, it is them wanting to take that path in life. You should not be concerned about yourself, be concerend for other people.
ToILKl6waa	The office has no business in your depression or feelings at all for that matter. Bring in a note that excuses you. Do not wind yourself up about that - it can be handled.    Now take a deep breath and realize that your academics are important and determine your future. You can squeeze in therapy when school is not your main priority, but now is the time to hold your head up. You must be brave and concentrate on getting the work that you missed and understanding all the material. If you don't feel comfortable asking a teacher, perhaps a friend or classmate can help you out with that.

fWwAicXdaa	Complaining is the science of the masses. Do you agree?    --UC Berkeley Economics student.    P.S. To think that someone who has probably spent a total of twenty minutes of his life pondering the complexities of the world economy would defile many individuals who have spent their entire lives studying economics is pretty discouraging to me. But then again, you know it all. Or maybe you don't.|`|YIlP4yNaaa	Not sure what you mean by that. Can you please elaborate?    To me, economics is observing and measuring things the way they are and trying to find reasons why things happen in certain ways.
PwvU3LQBaa	I find a couple of these answers funny as they come from men.  First off, I have had 2 kids.  My first with no epidural and my second with an epidural that wore off right before I had my daughter.  The reason I didn't get an epidural the first time was because the hospital said I wasn't dilated enough, so they sent me home.  I was hurting really bad at that point but I went home.  Finally I couldn't take it anymore and went back.  At that point I was at 5 cm and couldn't stay still long enough for an epidural.  I tore from one hole to the other and went into shock after my son was out.  At that point I didn't feel anything and they had to stick me up.     For everyone saying that kidney stones are more pain that childbirth, wrong.  They are a different kind of pain, not worse.  I have had them 3 times.  I would like to see some of these people who say they are worse to have them while you are pregnant.  The doctors won't give you much for the pain while pregnant so you just have to deal with the pain til you pass them.  It is not pleasant at all.  At least when men have kidney stones they can take whatever for pain and not have to worry about the painkillers affects on a baby.  Men can take pills for pain while pregnant women going through childbirth have very few options for painkillers.  The most popular is a big needle going into your back that could paralyze you.    So, Oz S, keep asking little old ladies about kidney stones and childbirth.  I am 32 years old and it hasn't been that long for me to go through either and I can remember the pain a lot better that those little old ladies you ask.  Next time ask them how long ago it was.  Why don't you ask younger people the same thing, their memories are more recent.  Oh, and ask them if they had kidney stones while pregnant and see which is worse.    I have been through both and you have no idea what you are talking about.  (Oz S)|`|iHKJsyfTaa	Because many men know women honest enough to admit that the pain involved with giving birth is way , way exaggerated , especially when she has an epidural and feels next to nothing.    Usually the exaggerated pain is a tool used to create a false sense of guilt in the mans mind in an attempt to create an unjustified indebtedness to her.|`|wkjncmHTaa	I think many traditional men seem to think that women are 'designed' for pregnancy and childbirth so it is never really that bad. It is strange though, I've never experienced late pregnancy or childbirth but I can easily imagine the complications you describe. Some men (and women - especially those that have experienced relatively easy pregnancies) are just lacking in empathy with regards to this.    It's beyond idiotic to say that because something is natural it doesn't cause pain or suffering. Cancer is natural - does that not cause pain?? So is being eaten by a lion or dying from eating a poisonous plant. Over half a million women die due to pregnancy or childbirth a year, often in excruciating pain. Millions more live with painful complications such as fistulas.|`|AA11530601	My guess is that they just dont realize how bad it is. Having never thought about it from the perspective of having to actually do it, I dont think they focus on the pain. For them the overriding thing is the idea of a new life coming into this world. They probably think that since we were "made to do it" we shouldnt complain about it. I personally have always felt that I never ever wanted kids, even when I was 6 yrs old I used to say that, and I intend to stick to that option. Some ppl find it shocking but if I ever want them (doubt it) Id adopt.|`|3862H0WVaa	I wouldn't be to hard on us for that.  As a man we do try to empathize with women.  But to us child birth is a natural act of nature and we don't really understand that nature would cause women such pain.    To be fair as well men that have been to the birth of their children do understand what the women has gone through.  Some men even if you believe the story have sympathy pains.  Most men are more worried about their other half more than the baby.|`|V1MptCMiaa	Because they think they know everything.

Also, women cry and complain at the drop of a hat, so we tend to discount women's suffering even if it's legitimate.  Maybe a mother can advise us, on a scale of 1-10 (1=slight discomfort, 10=deaths door), how bad is a normal childbirth?|`|oCHaJc49aa	I have been very keen to ask little old ladies (grandmothers, great grandmothers and one great GREAT grandmother, all of whom look like the first strong breeze would blow them away, and all of whom had brains as sharp as the proverbial razor, but were NEVER offensive) about this very topic.    My question arose because I had kidney stones and they were agonising.    I asked a grandmother  of my acquaintance about them, and she laughed - she had gone through them many times. I was intrigued. I asked her about how painful she felt it was.    Yes, pain is a very subjective thing, and one person's pain can be almost nothing, while another feels the pain most keenly.     She said the kidney stones were the worst pain she had gone through.    This is HER words, not mine.    I then asked her how many children she had given birth to. She said nine (that's 9). I then made the suggestion that these births would have been in a time when there would have been NO PAINKILLERS.    The Grandmother confirmed this with a laugh.     I then enquired if the child birthing process had been painful. The Grandmother laughed and emphatically said "Yes!"    I then asked her how she would compare the pain of the child birth to the pain of the kidney stones. Which was worse?    WITHOUT HESITATION, THE GRANDMOTHER, WHO HAD GIVEN BIRTH NINE (9) TIMES, SAID THE PAIN OF KIDNEY STONES WAS MUCH MUCH MUCH WORSE.    I have since made it my business to ask every little old lady I know the same series of questions.    Not ONE has dissented. All have confirmed the pain of kidney stones is WORSE, much worse, than the pain of child birth.    Please recall: these women ALL gave birth without pain killers, many time to 9 or 10 children.     It is a FLAGRANT FEMINIST LIE to insist that child-birth is "the worst pain a human can endure".     i know this because I, unlike the feminists, asked REAL women who had to undergo the "unassisted" child birth process and then had kidney stones afterwards. These real women have confirmed that this Feminist Lie is simply that: a lie, usually by those who have never given birth.|`|H55nCLqPaa	I think it is mainly a response to women blowing it way out of proportion. many of them seem to think that giving birth is the equivalent of a lifetimes hard work. No matter how bad it is it over fairly quickly, yet many women hold giving birth up to the true sacrifices that many men make as if the two are somehow equal.|`|f4uYkNwkaa	well it is a nice experience for you women. youre just faking the pain to get attention.|`|vEj7xoBraa	what's the big deal? Having kids it's a blessing.Yes you go through pain but that's just for a moment but they you realize that you have a tiny creature in your arm.|`|AA12219135	Maybe it's because they have no concept of what all childbirth entails?|`|fSAPBW28aa	Sure, giving birth is painful, but afterwards, you have a baby. After you get a kidney stone passed (which is more painful than giving birth) then all you have is this stone, whoopde doo.|`|ErkGf5ujaa	Most men discount or count anything about women purely for their emotional needs..By discounting,they push the discounted to subconcious(here it is the courage and miracolous creativity of women) to make it even bigger hence more insecure they appear.  The jealousy they have,that any women gives births,while retaining the potential of outside contribution.They also discount the time and concentration average women allocates for births and that men have 15-20 more young mature years to focus on one single subject and become rich or make a name on it.and claim  men did this and that more(!).I have yet to hear that a women says,look araund anybody you see is given birth to courageusly by a women.And that wouldn't be taking credit of 1/1000... of women.We hear vice versa when few men make a real name on anything and a lot of women with their scarce average time make big names.  They want to feel brave,they repeat  Titanic case,how women were first rescued,but,never ever count how many women in the past died giving births.(I now discount violence deaths of women)  I think these are the reasons that some men discount the pain and horror of pregnancy and birth as well.|`|zRPXczxAaa	Name one such man. You can't. You lie. There are no men who discount the pains many women go through in childbirth.  I have certainly never heard of any men who do. The litany of horror of the rest of your "question" suggests why you tell such a paltry, easily exposed lie: You merely and simply want to wallow in the misery of childbirth, with the false accusation of men's making light of it serving as your excuse to get downright grossly and morbidly explicit.  Ugh.      I can tell you that as soon as I spotted your non-question I knew better than to read its disgusting details--I bleeped right through it, as Lucille Van Pelt would say.  But I do have an answer for it:  Childbirth is something that men, naturally, will never experience first hand.  If you grow up on a farm, you'll know all you want to know about lambbirth, calfbirth and coltbirth, and puppybirth and kittenbirth--and that's really all you need to know, except that childbirth is worse.  So, so far from discounting the pains many women go through during childbirth, I prefer to know as little as possible about it.  What good could it do me, or the women giving birth, for me to know any more about it than I do?  I assume nothing, I presume nothing, and I have no opinion about it--except that I have discovered that most of the surgeries routinely inflicted on the mother and child serve no purpose but to increase the obstetrician's and the obstetric surgeon's fees.  Most episiotomies, and all circumcisions, should be classified as ritual surgical mutilations.  That's quite horrible enough, thank you.|`|4vG9ys8paa	I think it is because women play the birth card so many times that even though men know it's painful they get so tired of hearing the "OMG I bet that lady had your kids you should pay her for all the pain she went through!" as an excuse for so many things they start ignoring it after awhile. Besides, it DOES have its benefits to being a woman, I mean you get a way closer relationship with the child, you get off work, and you also pretty much automatically win in any parentage dispute. The reason for almost all of these things is that the woman gives birth. Honestly, I think there are quite a lot of fathers separated from their children by the mother who would go through something many times as painful as childbirth for three days straight to get custody of the child. They're just that tired of the childbirth card being played.    Or maybe it's the same reason women tend to ignore the pain of being kicked in the testicles.

So,yes, the worst trolls..well if you are defining a troll as someone who has the ability to form cogent argument, is not simply as good as the last lame internet article they found on why women should be kept in small cages, and objects to accepting everything said to them as true because you said it!

Perhaps you could give us an example of the questions you posted, then we can judge for ourselves.|`|1168bcccfff6f3a578ef3a0223e4cce5aa	YES, they are. While the anti-feminist trolls on here generally seem to concentrate on posting questions, which are often pointless (I read one yesterday asking what women had put up their vaginas), to get a reaction and get quickly deleted. The femiist trolls seem to want to find sexism in any question or comment and will infer it where there is none just to get a reaction. They make automatic assumptions based on the askers gender and use sarcasm in an attempt at sounding intelligent (pointless as it's counter productive).  It ruins the question completely as, once one starts, others concentrate on their comments and their approvals/disapproval of them rather than answering the question in hand.  I usually try to ignore both types of troll as they are no better than the other but do confess I find it more difficult to ignore the feminist trolls as they simply spoil the format for the rest of us.|`|BoqbYQ1Naa	And feminist trolls are the ones who delete feminist Q&A's because they just want to make the noble anti-fems look bad, right?

At first you will feel a strong feeling that makes you want to go back, that is why so many people can't quit. But you will definitely become more attracted to women in general. Once you are more attracted to her, she will notice it and your relationship will improve. The basic benefit is that you will get more real life action.   Also, if she finds out, it might hurt her. Your masterbation tells her that you are not really interested in her and don't find her that attractive. Plus if she is a person that gets jealous easily she will feel very jealous. This is because you are looking at other woman.

So if we say that animals have any kind of mental life (i.e. that they perceive, feel pain, maybe even work things out) then yes, they do seem to dream.  I suppose their dreams are distorted versions of their waking lives, just like ours are.|`|B2Itq6Fcaa	i'm sure they do. see how some dogs run while they sleep. but no one will know what they dream|`|grklGFwBaa	Go ask one, Dr. Doolittle.

Dreams are made of DMT. All mammals produce DMT in their pineal glands so I'd assume they also dream and have near death experiences. We have hundreds of dreams in one night, maybe an infinite amount of dreams if you approach things spiritually. What do you think intelligence is? If it is only useful for humans to know that 2 is the square root of 4 then does that represent intelligence for an animal? I personally think that intelligence is subjective. Our IQ levels are in relationship to the material in the test, not on everything else. I can't think of any way to measure intelligence.|`|gKEjxwNiaa	i'm not sure, but am i know my has dreamed before|`|qxteTM9Kaa	My dog dreams all the time,by the way he acts he must be chasing cats or something

Try minding your own business, in one year your sister will be 18 and if it was her asking those questions, she has every right to, she doesnt need a sister like you preventing her from finding out information.

And you don't have any kind of "proof" of anything. For all you know, she was just googling those things out of curiosity.    And by the way, 17 really isn't all that young.

I used to read books and magazine articles on sex way before I ever thought about actually trying it. She may just be curious, especially if sex is a taboo topic in your household.    It's normal to be shocked if someone close to you does something unexpected, but she's still your sister and she needs your love and support. Perhaps you could talk to your parents or a close friend/relative and get them to have a chat with her?

Anyway, even if she is having sex, you must understand that in much of the world nowadays this is considered acceptable,a nd if you live in a western society (I do not know whether you do or not), she is invariably going to meet young people who are sexually active and see nothing wrong in this.      You need to try and calm down.  Screaming at your sister will not achieve anything.  If you believe that what she is doing is wrong (if indeed she is having sex) then sit down and talk to her about it calmly.

iUzSlmSbaa	Jealousy or envy is a sign that you are feeling insecure. I am quite sure that your coach is not really interested in your friend at all .. maybe she is just a person who it's easy to talk to .. some people are more reserved and others more outgoing.. some people make others want to confide in them.. but there is no reason for being jealous.. I guess she is just open minded and maybe she talks to others and that is her personality.. Maybe she asks the coach questions and he feels she is really interested in what you are doing...cross country...so he answers her or talks to her more because he believes she is interested in what you are doing..I am sure that the coach has no personal interest in your friend nor in any of those participating...other than being your coach. Just believe in yourself and your abilities. Everybody has weaknesses and strenghts.. everyone.. so does your friend.. no person is perfect and I am sure she likes you and cares about you the way you are and she is your friend because you mean a lot to her.. and she means a lot to you as well, otherwise you would not have been scared that she was in an accident and very relieved that she is alright.. Talk to her.. tell her how you felt about when you heard about the accident.. and also be open how you feel sometimes.. when the coach gives more attention to her.. and I am sure she is not even really aware of it... that he is talking more to her... Definitely this is not worth to ruin a friendship.. the coach will go his way.. he probably has a GF or depending on his age.. he may even be engaged or married... and when one of you meet a guy... then I hope that you both don't fall for the same guy... LOL.. that would be a drama.. If she was my friend and we did not talk about the cross country coach (because he doesn't count as he doesn't matter) but if there was a guy.. and you would be interested in him and your best friend would be interested in him.. ''cross my heart and hope to die'' ...then I would really hope that the guy would have a preference.. and whoever he would chose to date.. whether that would be me or my friend.. I would accept it.. because I would only want to be with a guy who chooses me.. because he prefers me over anyone else.. so I would not be jealous if he chose her..     I am sure you are both great girls and both of you have different characteristics.. both of you are unique in your own special way.. I am quite certain when there is someone important.. you will both find the right guy for both of you.. and won't have to fight over him.. and the cross country coach he is just your coach...but one can talk to ones friend about ones feelings.. so you should tell her what she means to you.. I am sure you mean the same to her..  which is why this whole jealousy thing is definitely not worth the loss or the risking of a friendship.. a real friendship is a great gift.. Coaches come and go...and as soon as you start believing that you are equal to your friend..  that you are not below and not above her.. but that both of you are equals .. with your own unique character traits.. but both girls with strenghts and weaknesses.. you won't have to fear competition.. Just believe you are as good as everyone else.. then you won't feel jealous..you will develop your own goals.. and go after them.. your friend will pursue her own.. but that does not mean you two can't go on being friends.. and remaining friends.
3f8HVRGRaa	Jealousy is a normal human emotion. And, just like any other human emotion, it can't just be shut off on every whim. But, what matters is how you act on this jealousy. Don't be petty about it and just try to understand why the coach my be treating her specially.    If this attention is because of the accident, more than likely, it'll fade fast. Give it a week or two and I bet that it'll stop.

7UlGCzzeaa	Psychology is a science which concerns itself with the study of behavior, both human and animal, and therefore interrelates with other disciplines such as philosophy, biology and sociology. In the minds of most though, psychology is connected with the treatment of mental disorders (clinical psychology) or assisting the resolution of relationship problems (counselling psychology). Few realized that as the study of human and animal interaction involves how these organisms perceive the world around them and how they react to these perceptions, this interaction may be observed in all areas of human activity. The areas of investigation for psychologist are therefore vast and varied as illustrated by the many specialized fields of psychology open for study, such as: Organizational Psychology, Environmental Psychology, Educational Psychology, Forensic Psychology and Sports Psychology.    Psychologists therefore search for answer to the question why. From this research they develop theories of human functioning, often developing new approaches to current knowledge. From this perspective it can be seen that both normal and abnormal behavior are the psychologists domain.    Although psychology is a comparatively young science it is not static, it is growing all the time and influencing other disciplines, particularly those discipline which tended to place less importance on human interaction elements, such as: Engineering, Management and the Law.    However the cornerstone of psychological practice still revolves around the examination and treatment of mental and emotional problems whatever the trigger or area of concern. Be it stress related to the working environment, trauma or shock following a catastrophic life event or the development of a particular form of mental illness such as schizophrenia. Here from research, whether independently or within a multidisciplinary team, the psychologist attempts to offer answers and formulate treatment methods.|`|3tnistZQaa	Yes. To put it simply, psychologists use the scientific method.

The Tom Hanks character is faced with a situation where he must first deal with the basic needs of survival - food, shelter, etc.   He then faces the difficulty of having social needs met - hence the construction of Wilson, the soccer ball companion.  He ultimately achieves a new found sense of self-esteem through his survival.

Everyone wants to date someone who is very attractive, but at the same time we generally know our limits (in terms of who will find us attractive). Occasionally, you will find odd matched pairs (a really attractive female with an unattractive male); however, this generally happens when the woman is attracted to something the man has (e.g., money, material goods, etc.)|`|uXQcDsiAaa	For some one to be happy, turned on, attracted to... a fluid in your brain needs to be released in to your body.

X9Dpyrg9aa	I don't think that wanting to help young children makes you a pedophile. If that were true then wouldn't that make all Sunday school teachers and elementary school teachers pedophiles. If you have any inappropriate thoughts about these children then I would worry, but otherwise don't worry about what people think. You know the rule, "Only God can judge". He sees your heart and what you are trying to do.|`|Ctdg2paYaa	Justin,    Definitely you are not a pedophile since your letter at no point does indicate sexual interest for those kids. Please clearly inform your brother and  the misguided members of your family that only individuals with sexual feelings and intentions towards children are pedophiles. Be aware these type of wrong ideas when made into comments can ruin a man's life and reputation. Not one of actions are of a pedophile, is only in your family's mind.    Continue your loving work, and also take care of yourself, you are giving so much, and you need to receive in order to keep going, is not fair to be unjustly accused, I know the feeling.     Good luck,  Adi|`|iUzSlmSbaa	Not at all Justin, if you told us the truth.. then definitely you are to be admired for doing something good.. and not something bad.  If you talk to those boys or try to help them over suicidal thoughts and reading to them while they are in hospital or you give them attention in as far as acknowledging their existance and you play games with them.. then that has nothing to do with being a pedophile at all that means you are trying to help them.. A social worker is often a man.. he helps families and children in trouble and he is not a pedophile. so if that is what you are doing.. being like a brother to them.. talking to them.. listen to them.. then that is absolutely normal and good of you.. and has nothing at all to do with pedophilia.. I don't know why your family would see you as a pedophile if really all you are doing is trying to be there for the boys.. as long as you have no sexual desire and do not touch them in any sexual way.. then you are not a pedophile if you have no such thoughts on your mind and never did such a thing.. then what you do is a good thing.. not a bad thing at all to care about someone who needs somebody to talk to.. or to be there for them. If that is what you do you should consider to make that into a career.. become a social worker.. help others.. in that case your brother is a fool and you should ignore him...|`|O9HLoDj9aa	I don't think you sound like a pedophile at all. I think you're doing something good:)|`|j0SozMmzaa	Some very good comments  before mine, worth listening to. I would throw some caution to the wind however.    Your comments :    " I don't care about my life, but only theirs. I know the things I do seem pedophilia, but really that's not what I am" .    " so I cant be a 100% active person in their lives".     " I would rather die ".    Be aware of what you are saying, I may have taken three sentences out of context or in tandem do they have a particular meaning.|`|6232dd37ccf9c50bd95a31fea560fff1aa	You are a pedophile only if you were sexually attracted to them/harassing them sexually. Otherwise sounds fine to me|`|c6eae266bb501e0a315d4b3e606f9c99aa	Paedophiles befriend children because they have a sexual interest in them.  Unless you're leaving that part out, you're not a paedophile.

3f8HVRGRaa	The only way to get over shyness is very simple. That is, to stop being shy. It's hard, but you are the new kid and have to make yourself open to the people around you, even if that's only one person to start off it. That one person might really like you and you could become friends with their friends.    Unfortunately, high school is not like the old '80s movies. You don't just walk in the right hair cut and shoes and become the school's golden girl.     Is your boyfriend like you? Does he go to your school? Why can't he introduce you to his friends? I'm guessing Alexandria is a lot smaller than Chicago, so it's only natural to be a bit apprehensive about situations that might arise. Just be open to meeting new people. Don't sit in the back corner of class praying for someone to talk to. Comment on a girl's hair or purse or something and ask where she got it. That's a really simple way to break the ice. Then, casually bring up that you're new and don't know anyone in town and ask can you sit with her at lunch.|`|1VPFZEZAaa	You have no idea how much i relate to you, except im a year younger, but just go up to random people, probably when their alone and talk...your can be like me [on my random days] go up to someone and randomly high five them, and than from there start saying hi when you see them, than start with asking their name, and one day just ask them to hang out and than talk to them more, and that could easily be a way to make friends.     but, good luck (:
3p6wp7DYaa	The variance of a sample measures how the observations are spread around the mean. Large variance means the date is widely spread around the mean. To convert this information to the same units as your mean, take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation. You get 25. You also need to brush up on the empirical rule, which states that in a normal distribution, 68% of the data will fall within 1 standard deviation from the mean.    So what this is saying is that 68% of all points of your data will be between 425 and 475 (450 - 25 and 450 + 25). You should draw the curve and plug in the points to have a visual aid to the problem. You need to draw the bell curve with the mean in the middle the the values for 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations. 500 is 450 + 2 standard deviations, correct? That means that 95% of your data will be less than 500. Here's a good source for descriptive statistics: http://www.netmba.com/statistics/distrib...    Good luck!
UXc6lMZBaa	I guess that the fact that you're driving with your girlfriend in your dream means that it's about your relationship with her over time; down the "road of life" as they say. The dying man and the baby might be something between you too. I think the man represents good intentions. Since the baby has cuts on its face and its mouth is taped shut, I think that if it is evil it is evil only from abuse. For an thought in your head, denial is a kind of abuse. Alternatively, it might seem hostile to you because you are afraid of it. Is this because there are things that are unsaid between you and your girlfriend? Something you need to tell her? Maybe the baby is dead-looking because you decided that you wouldn't tell her.    Your girlfriend's dream was about her need to be heard and understood by other people, or that need to be heard that she sees in others. Maybe it's even about the need to be heard that she sees in you.    ESP isn't real. I think that the congruence between your dreams was caused by one of the following:    1) A shared experience that would make you both think of "HELP ME"  2) A coincidence. It's not like "HELP ME" is a very obscure message.|`|2VbgWMzmaa	if people havent even figured out why we have dreams, than how do you excpect us to know what they mean??|`|wv3OdRmUaa	Dude just calm down lol its just a dream!!

9fc6963cbdae594803724cff5fd4fb54aa	1. trust issues - lies - annoyance  2. have them talk it out  3. you can't possibly know what it's like to be a friend unless you have a good one in your life  4. no - girlfriends talk about boys and hair and nails and focus more on trusting each other. when a boy is friends with a girl, the friendship is more for fun and enjoyment, not necessarily for advice  5. the relationship will fall apart - although talking is very important, it's no more important than actions  6. it really cannot be a relationship - a relationship is formed from knowing someone, not from doing things with them. talking is the only way to really know someone  7. trust is definetly something that i bring to friendships. you have to fully trust someone in order to be friends and confide in them|`|1VPFZEZAaa	1. Changing, how people change, you could become a different person and one friend might not like that causing a problem;;  Liking the same guy/girl as your friend does/going out with their ex;;  Not being there for them when they need you the most;;  Or trying to get them to quit doing something thats hurting them [ like drugs,alcohol,etcetc.  2. Talk to both, find out each of their sides of the story and try to find a way to resolve it. Or from experience, let them settle it their own sometimes helping can lead to an even bigger problem  3.You can only have one half of the friendship trying to be the friend..you need 2 halfs in order to get it to work, like a relationship, except a friendly one lol.  4.Yes, because if you no similar qualities odds are there will be a ton of arguing throughout the time being, and thats not good, so best bet is to become friends first than see how it goes from there  5.They'll have a emotional connection where they feel for eachother a lot but eventually they'll meet someone who they can talk to and do things with and it'll cause a problem or a just friends relationship.  6.It'll just be about that, doing things, and it'll eventually get boring after time to where someone cheats or just ends it completely.  7.Sense of humour as long as you can laugh and have fun with your friends it builds the relationship knowing you can get comfort out of laughing and smiling when your with your friends.    5 and 6 i lead more towards dating relationship, but it can also be the same for friendship, just the person will start hanging out with different people, or talking to diff people.    hope i helped.  good luck :]|`|UD4VICvPaa	1. The main issues that can cause an argument is usually jealousy or maybe that friend accused the other one of doing something like I took a toy from you saying it was mine and you said it was yours.. or when something happens that you dont agree on  2. You can usualy talk to each of them and get both sides of the story if that dosent work then just explain to eachother how long they have been friends and how easy it is to just make up and forgive  3. It means that if you really want to haev a friend you have to be nice to them and do what you would want  your friend to do to you.  4. (not sure if I am answering this right) YES! beacuse you dont want your boyfriend to only love you for one reason I mean they are like your friends and if you want a good bfriend you want them to love and care for u like a friend  5.well, that relationship could start gossip or they could just move on and be like well we never hang out maybe she just dosent like me  6. They might be mad at someone and be buildiong up feelings inside then all of a sudden blow them out and be like you know what you never want to know about my feelings so what does it matter  7. kindness-they are always there for you and they dont care what you look like or if you are poor or rich funny- they will always make u laugh truthfull- they can tell you ANYTHING no matter what it is you can always trust them if you have a bad outfit

z93tSvKxaa	Absolutely. Not just imports but immigration as well.      Please pass this info on to your other fellow American workers:  http://www.americanworker.org/index.html    WE CANNOT AFFORD to consume products and not produce anything.    WE CANNOT AFFORD to continue to allow HB1-visas to take away American workers.  Yes there are American workers who can do the job.  However, companies want to pay cheap wages and not real wages, yet continue to rake in record profits.    WE CANNOT AFFORD to continue to be the welfare state of the world.  Medicare, medicaid, and welfare benefits should be for those who pay into the system.  This goes for Americans who are also leeching off the system as well.    TAX CREDITS FOR TAX PAYERS.. Obama and his administration want to continue the democratic welfare politics.  They are also working to expand the so-called Free Trade agreements.  There is NO SUCH THING as free trade.      If America does not start becoming a productive country, this country will NEVER get out of debt.  Unfortunately Obama and his welfare administration does not see this.  They can continue to pump money into banks and food stamps as much as they like but this will not create jobs.      A good example is the market collapse of Iceland. One of the richest economies in the world.  However with the fall of the banking crises they lost.    So, when will elected officials get this?|`|AA10253095	Absolutely, and we need to raise tariffs on imports to get Americans to buy the American goods more often.

Marie Curie changed the world, Eisntein did, Billy/Franklin Graham have changed many people's lives, preaching the Gospel and salvation.

Which ever way is best i have found that allocating this time zone to unsolved emotions or problems makes it easier for me to understand a have addressed the situation, and therefore enables me to carry out other activites with a clear mind. The alterative to allocating time is to be worried throughout the day therefore spoiling any chances of you thinking positively. good luck

As you grow-up and by that I mean 25-30yrs. old girls will see you different and you will want a girl who appreciates you for your qualities.    I really don't know what it is or why but girls also seem to be attracted to possessive,controlling type guys.

YtcMZaUNaa	You are on the right track.  I am majoring in Psychology and Biology as my undergraduate major, and I also want to go to medical school to be a psychiatrist.  I took some classes in media, like advertising and marketing, but I saw that there was a moral dilemma there.  Don't make it confusing by taking classes in media and economics,  unless you want to be someone who takes classes in psychology and advertising so they can manipulate people by putting price tags on everything.  If you do take anything media related, take journalism or other writing courses in the English department to boost your writing skills.   Take classes in Psychology, like Behavioral Neuroscience, Sensation and Perception, Abnormal Psych.  Take classes in Biology, like Human Biology, and anatomy and physiology.  Take Pharmacology. Chemistry is good too.  Also, consider taking Interpersonal Communication, or something similar to this in the speech department, due to the fact that your relationships as a Psychiatrist will be interpersonal.  Philosophy will help you develop your beliefs about ethics.  Just take any combination of these types of classes.  Your research and how treat people is based on what you attain from your studies.|`|OhRpLbInaa	Clinical Psychology is one of the most sought after jobs in the country. To be a Clinical Psychologist, (which is what I assume you are after) it is not the A-levels you do, but how well you do at them and consequently what University you go to, and how well you do at that University that determines whether or not you'll be successful in being a Clinical Psychologist.  On my best friends first day at Nottingham University, (a very good uni for psych), he was told that approximately 2 out of the 200 people in the class would end up being psychologists. THe rest would use their degree in other ways.    If you are seriously interested in psychiatry, then perhaps you should consider studying Medicine first off?  I personally would look first at what Universities you wanted to attend, and then looked at what their requirements were. But if you are seriously interested in doing Medicine, (at any point) I would reccommend studying Chemistry and probably Biology.  Naturally, Psychology at A level would probably help you decide whether or not it's the right course for you, as I also believe (but cannot be sure) that psychology has one of the higher drop out rates of University courses.    Hope I've been of some help!  If I can offer any more (although I'm hardly an expert), please email me.  Thanks.|`|AA11631965	psychology, and art|`|5O7op0oIaa	Oddly enough, not pyschology.    A-levels are a relavtively low standard, compared to degrees, and include a lot of 'shortcuts'. Pyschology professors reckon it's extra work to make you unlearn all of this before they can actually get down to teaching you the degree-level stuff.      I'd go for English, History, and Biology. When you're writing your personal statement, and mentioning transferable skills, these will put you in good stead.    EDIT: I'd do Philosophy and Ethics, as it's bound to be interesting - but it's utterly valueless on your UCAS application.    EDIT: also, avoid sociology - it's considered to be Pyschology Lite.|`|Vk2zPoqUaa	Always do English. Psychology, Human Biology and Critical Thinking/Sociology are your best bets.    You should speak to a careers advisor.|`|XmD61yBpaa	Technical drawing|`|OlZmUFXIaa	you should talk to your counsellor he'd help you out|`|0UHI7CoRaa	Any would help.    But you can study to be a psychologist by taking various courses, most of which can be found at the open university.    Do a few introductory to psychology courses and build up your points and you can eventually do a degree course, or even a Diploma.    I suspect you will need to work very hard for the next few years to become a fully qualified psychologist. It would be wise to try and get employment somewhere you can gain experience, its not good being fully trained on paper and not be able to put your new skills to practice.    Hope this Helps :D

1d144c3a5d03c47f15784117493133c8aa	Because India has such a large population the working class citizens in America will face a lot more competition in the labor pool.

Meaning everything is predetermined therefore it is not in your control. One can argue that they are not responsible of any of their actions because of this idea. A more realistic approach i would say is that certain parameters are determined like physics and other scientific rules but as a conscious rational individual you have the ability to make significant choices.     google fatalism or wiki it|`|NqOxQzlraa	The common sense term is selfishness, but if you want a psychological term I'd go for cognitive dissonance.
6pCQTT4saa	People tend to dream based on what they've seen.  I know a lot of book readers who will dream they are in the place of book characters, but the stories keep switching.    There are two ways of looking at it, the first is that it's not a problem what you dream, since the dreams are just based off of your experiences, which is a popular view.    The second is that dreams reflect moral character or can mean something, which is an interesting view.  For instance, when I was younger and much more cowardly, I used to have dreams where I was terrified and running from something.  Now I've faced a lot more of my fears, and I don't have those dreams anymore.  Now I have different dreams warning me of different things.    Abraham Lincoln dreamed before he was shot that he would die.  Lots of people have dreamed about things before they happen.    Personally, I think dreams are both--they can be just random chemicals swirling around in your eyes, or they can mean something.  They can be mirrors of your moral character.  God can tell you things through them.    Your dream may just be a swirling vortex, or it may mean something.  I think that if it means something, it means this:  whatever you do to others will come back to you.  When you were cutting into the man's stomach, you cut yourself, too.  Most people don't realize that when they try to hurt other people, they hurt themselves, also.  This is something good to think about for me, too.    Just some thoughts.|`|PwnRqFP3aa	sounds pretty normal to me, dreaming is the time when your brain is actually active the most, so your imagination is really active
9fnbMzXnaa	I think poor parenting can often be blamed... Our parents are supposed to teach us how to "deal" with things.  If they neglect this important  lesson, the child suffers because he or she is armed with poor coping skills. Some people are intuitive enough to learn such life lessons on their own, some learn in therapy. Which can be very,very helpful.  Also, parents should establish a feeling of being "safe" in the world. If parents don't make a little one feel loved and protected, that little person grows up with a constant feeling of being ill at ease in the world.  Some people never get over it, but I believe that all of us can, we just sometimes need help.|`|AA11530601	low self esteem. Traumatizing experiences. Lack of love from parents and lack of acceptance from other kids at school (where most ppl turn of they dont have much affection from their parents) can all lead to people "disowning" themselves, they feel inadequate and unable to accept themselves. They see that others are more confident and get bitter and envious. They try and be something they are not (a rebel or a slu*t or whatever they choose), because they feel something is wrong with who they are deep down. Its a terrible feeling. Having over controlling parents can cause problems with identity too.|`|jEZbYZwMaa	It can develope from thinking too much, you know.. overanalyzing and stuff. And then also from traumatizing experiences.|`|1MgpiqfJaa	i believe it boils down to coping skills we all have some type of anxiety however minor they may be..when we are young the teasing of our peers can be very hurtful it doesn't matter if it is race  or even the way you speak..for example a 1st grader moves from Georgia to New York (or visa versa)the kids at their new school may not even understand what they are saying hence they get teased or have to constantly repeat themself they can be made to feel inferior ..our past has so much to do in shaping who we become..parents can always be negative or even in some cases over protective and not allow you to participate in sports or other social activities..    it is extremely difficult to overcome this and as an adult if you are like this you must find a way to overcome it that fits your lifestyle..i know from experience it can be done i am extremely shy and always thought people would dislike me for whatever reason and it took awhile am still shy but not to the point u could call it a phobia

GA5BAhaRaa	I think my parents do the same thing to me sometimes.     They make me play softball which I loathe because they say 'you're good at it' and for some reason that's suppose to justify things?  It's bullshit too because I want to do track and I'm pretty good at running too so...I pretty much shot down all the reasons they came up with for why I should play softball and they still don't listen.    And for college and school as well.  They're always, especially my mother, putting me on this pedestal thinking I'm the greatest thing in the world and that I'm wicked smart; and I keep saying, 'Mother! Stop it! There are so many more people out there, countless numbers of people, that are much more intelligent and more talented than me.' But she won't have it, she'll just say 'Ohh that's not true, you're great you can do anything.'    It pisses me off because when I tell her that I have no useful skills that will help me in life she just laughs it off. But it's true; I get good grades, but am I any good at anything? Writing, science, math? No; I'm simply not good enough at any of these things to make it. She wants me to go to some great school and do something that I'm going to hate (because everything disinterests me) and that's not what I want! I'm suppose to be the 'smart' one in the family (which is truly, truly laughable) and so she expects me to always do great things; but I'm not going to, I simply can't do it!    I guess it's not completely the same thing as what happened to you; but I really wish my mother would see that I have many, many limits to my capabilities so she'd stop having such high expectations.    I could go on in more melodramatic detail but I'll spare you and my own dignity the trouble and humiliation.|`|2VbgWMzmaa	i believe that only 5% of parents put TOO MUCH pressure on their kids, im talking about those parents who ground kids after they get a 97 avg instead of 98, but i tihnk almost 50%-60% of parents dont put enough pressure, pretty much every kid that struggles in school usually has a parent that doesnt care about their eduaction. and i also think that you should just care about the money because the way this messed up economy is going, the only people with good lives in the future are going to be the ones with good jobs, being happy doesnt put the food on the table.|`|6t76bgS3aa	My parents weren't like that ... but then again my dad's unemployed and writes books that he can't get anyone publish.  i knew a girl who was chinese and her parents pushed her really hard.  different families are different.|`|Y1Ues6z2aa	yes x-x|`|ewQDWKp0aa	My parents weren't like that|`|JxDE5C85aa	oooooooohhhhhhhhh yeeesssssssssss!!!!     my parents do!!! and i don't like it

First go to the store and buy about 30 packets of jell-o and  about 10 gallons of oil (baby oil, cooking oil, really anything). Go to a party store and find a decent costume ... for example you might go for a giant gorilla suit. Buy a small plastic toddler pool and create your jell-o/ oil mixture. Invite your BF over and make him remove his clothes and close his eyes. Slip into your gorilla outfit and tell him to open his eyes. He will know what to do from here|`|O9HLoDj9aa	If you don't know how, then you're probably not old enough to be doing it.

Few things at work need to be taken personally, especially with a boss like her.|`|EoawVhBTaa	people are stupid when it comes to electronics. she may just not know what shes talking about. dont take offense|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Resisting the idea of your boss being bossy is only going to encourage your boss. You can take it personally or not, whatever is convenient, because why not? If you want to be offended, why stop yourself? If you want your boss to be less bossy, then your apparent acceptance isn't necessary either. Ignoring it completely is best. If it takes effort to ignore it then that's not true ignorance. Ignore by not judging it as good or bad or anything.|`|bOaqWNxRaa	If that is the worst thing your boss ever says to you, you need to realize how fortunate you are. Some bosses are friggin NASTY.

QAtpLEEFaa	if you reverse the question and ask why has the birthrate in rich countries declined the the answer is easier to see.      Countries where   1.people have a secure economic future, and even more importantly    2.where women have enough economic power to be able to control their own lives especially their own fertility    have low birth rates    thats why ngos, and governments, concerned about keeping population levels low,  focus on improving womens education and on improving womens general day to day power over their lives and their bodies.    3. population figures are also  affected by the relationship between fertility rates and mortality rates so (see any web site on demographic transition theory) So lower mortality rates also affect population rates.    4. finally there is the 'lily pond factor.' ie.  if lilies grow 100% every year then the year before the pond is completey covered is the year the lilies cover only half the pool. In other words the more people we have the more people we are going to have in the next generation....     ........unless we make the changes suggested above.|`|0vQsoYIbaa	The industrial revolution made it possible for most people to work a 10 hour day instead of from dawn to dusk.

People are living longer,healthier, and more comfortable.|`|3f8HVRGRaa	Advancement in medical care. Simple as that. A population grows when mortality rates go down. 100 years ago, it was common for children to die early on and for people to not live as long as they do now. Everything from washing your hands to advancement in surgical care to antibiotics and other medication all contribute.

But if they only care themselves then its a wast of time. I just listen, but not take them too seriously.|`|Jjx90cCQaa	Well it's because that person isn't getting enough attention from their bf or gf, so they don't feel loved.

Who wants that?|`|hZ9omSataa	every ones fav word is their own name|`|aQ9hXCU1aa	People who enjoy talking more about themselves or bragging upon themselves have an inferiority complex. Because others in their lives have talked down about them, simply disagreed with them often, or never got along with them is the reason an individual like this talks about themselves often. What they've accomplished, who all they know, how good they are, why another is "so stupidly wrong", and in the end if someone else is right they are "that's just what I was thinking!  Your right!" A person that also states how many famous people they've met or had dinner with. These are your individuals that stay single and by themselves with a relationship here and there every once in a while, simply because nobody can handle them for too long. They are also called narcissists. Some Dads are this way with there sons. I've got one.
de716a7218c6535ff5cb2a195dc59d50aa	Clinical Psychology is about mental health problems and personality disorders. You look at possible causes, symptoms and how to treat them.    Social Psychology is about social influences and how they influence peoples behaviour. So you look at things like relationships or group behaviour.    Developmental Psychology is about how an individual develops. So you look at subjects like language, personality, cognitive and emotional development.    But this is all very basic. What I suggest is you read up on them all via wikipedia and the like. That will probably give you a much better idea :)|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Clinical Psych. - Treatment of patients with various disorders.

9uorn5Qyaa	Hmmm......that is a weird dream. I have dreams like that a lot, that I really just can't explain. One time I was in NYC to see a play, but I was kinda in the life of Lizzie Mcguire, lol I know, and I saw my favorite actress there, and I was so happy, but I woke up, and for a second I thought it really happened! Your actually the first person I've told that to.   But my point is, there are a lot of dreams that are unexplainable. Did you not do your homework that day? Are you scared of elevators? Did you spend a lot of time with quan that day? In a way, there are and there aren't a lot of explanations for this. I would just let it go. But dreams are freaky. =)|`|8R71JMumaa	I honestly don't understand some of it either lol, but I think the feeling sick part was because your stomach was hurting somehow, so it reflected and became part of your dream.
NAGiNKFWaa	grant money is hard to find these days.  I am not sure if Save Our Schools still offers grant money for poor schools.  It used to give money to schools for the school lunch program.  Chapter 1 money is usually for poor schools.  I heard of a school district that was in desperate need of money, so they canceled the football program.  Suddenly the local businesses managed to come up with the money for the football program, they put the money in a separate account, and the money could only be used for the football program, but it turned out to be a smart plan for the school.  It got the money it needed, and the local businesses got their Friday night business from the football games.  Some schools I have worked for fired high paying employees for bogus reasons, and hired new employees at a cheaper salary.  A really good way to help poorly funded schools is to hire an independent auditor.  Most schools have money, it is just misspent.|`|3f8HVRGRaa	A bake sale can only raise so much money. Little parent-run organizations may get the cheerleaders new uniforms, but to really help significantly, taxes would have to be raised. The more taxes you pay, the bigger percentage goes to schools.    But, if you mean what YOU can do, I guess a bake sale would have to work because convincing people to vote for more taxes would be a miracle.    I guess, though, if parents get more involved and see how hard a school is struggling, they could bring attention to it and get donations or even get someone to go over the budget if it's really bad.|`|VR3soAktaa	student/parent/facilty fundraisers (bake sales, carwashes, etc). some times tv shows or famous people will set up programs. just look around on google and see what you can find :)

rO0LyKiUaa	Is your shyness natural or do you feel like an outgoing person trapped in a box?    If you are naturally shy then you are quite happy about your shyness and you are generally shy everywhere.. including the home.    If you are shy in new situations but completely outgoing at home and with people you know really well then you may have social anxiety.      You are obviously not confident in speaking to people.  I have asperger syndrome and I wonder if you have it to?    I have always had shyness which was not because I was genuinly shy but because I was scared of new situations and people and this made me feel trapped.    Maybe you should et some help so that you can step it up a bit.    Hope this helps x|`|f2cQrG7jaa	No one wants confidence, they want what it offers to us. In being as specific as possible you can deconstruct your presumptions of the world around you. You aren't shy and you should find out why. You aren't anything and finding out why is an effortless search. It doesn't require thought. All it requires is for you to be open to any possibility while life molds you with it's own effort.    You have to be willing to be stupid, to be wrong. To being shy. As long as you are willing to embrace the changes around you wont be so quick to call yourself shy or low esteem. Calling yourself shy doesn't do you any good, being specific is where change occurs. Change is necessary and the conflicts we face are the resistance to that change.

9c8zvpHoaa	I personally hate talking on the phone as well. I prefer speaking to others face-to-face, or else on instant messenger or e-mail. I like the first because I can see the other person and react not only to their voice, but to their facial expressions. It's also easier for my or their sarcasm to come across, so things are rarely misinterpreted. On instant messenger or in an e-mail, you can take the time to really make sure that you're actually saying what you want to, and if you don't like it, you can always go back and edit it. Talking on the phone allows for neither of these options, so it is understandable why you would have such an aversion to it. I'm the same way!|`|Ctdg2paYaa	R_S    My sister is just like you, everyone is different, a little secret?

Just kindly explain that you prefer to communicate using other methods. Voila!    Regards,  Adi|`|N1ot1wpRaa	Maybe you don't like the ambiguity of a phone call. You can't use body language to help you, such as smiling, frowning etc  And if you are not a very verbal person this could be difficult.     Also with a phone call, you can't really know what to expect, as you can't see the other person. It is also ambigous and in a way 'unreal'? Perhaps you like to be able to physically see something or hold something, in that way knowing the reality rather than imagining or speaking to the 'unknown'?    The 'unknown' evokes fear in all people but in different situations and circumstances. Maybe this is yours?    These are just ideas, but I hope they get you thinking :)    I just searched it and found this, hope it helps    http://wiki.hypertwins.org/index.php/Pho...
AA11879518	adolescents (teens, etc.) are experiencing the effects of the internet on their lives now more than ever before.  Now, girls realize that a way to get attention is to use their sexuality.

9fnbMzXnaa	When you are in a group of new people, focus less on what they think of you, and focus more on getting to know them. Ask questions...get them to talk about themselves (most people secretly love to do this...).  The beauty of it is...While the are talking about themselves, you don't need to talk at all...So no need to be shy.  You can make way more friends in a day trying to learn about people than you can in a year trying to get them to be interested in you.  When I am in a big group I usually find one or two people that make me feel relatively comfortable and focus on them. Some of us just do better one on one.   I really hope this helps! Just don't be too hard on yourself...It gets easier. So much easier...|`|VUfT35UQaa	I know exactly what you mean, first let me put it out there: In your teens, people will offer you drugs that will make you feel confident for a few hours, while poisoning and rotting your body, and leading to depression.    NEVER DO DRUGS    Okay, now, onto advice: Hang around in a small group first, get to know the people well, and if you think something, don't be afraid of saying it, what will they do? disagree? and even then every one is entitled to an opinion!    If you feel like it's something you can't bring yourself to do, don't feel weird, you're an introvert, so what? You can see a doctor confidentially and if need be you can see a counselor.    Be happy with yourself before trying to be accepted by others, and never change who you are.    P.S. You sound like the sensitive quiet type, if you're a nice guy as well (I'm sure you are), when you get to college or Uni, girls will find that attractive, don't try and be loud if it's not who you are.      I hope this helps :D|`|f2cQrG7jaa	The very reason you say it wont happen over night, is the reason you think you need help. Applying labels to yourself doesn't help you. You have to be okay with being shy and not talking for the world to change you. Life wants you to be in conflict and as soon as something isn't conflicting is will shoot something else at you. You have to be willing to go through what you are going through. You can't expect things to happen that will make you more willing, you just have to decide. It takes NO time. IT is effortless.

Remain yourself, just a more confident you.

No, it won't happen overnight but if you work on it people will like you and you'll have a lot more fun.|`|rO0LyKiUaa	Is your shyness natural or do you feel like an outgoing person trapped in a box?    If you are naturally shy then you are quite happy about your shyness and you are generally shy everywhere.. including the home.    If you are shy in new situations but completely outgoing at home and with people you know really well then you may have social anxiety.    You are obviously not confident in speaking to people. I have asperger syndrome and I wonder if you have it to?    I have always had shyness which was not because I was genuinly shy but because I was scared of new situations and people and this made me feel trapped.    Maybe you should et some help so that you can step it up a bit.    Hope this helps x|`|VAt8EPF4aa	you know, i am the SAME way.  but usually when im in the moment, and i think of something to say, i dont freak out about what people will think, i just hurry up and say it.  soon i start to get more compfortable around those people.  and your right, it doesnt happen over night, but just relax yourself.  and remember that everyone ends up saying something stupid once in a while. but im sure no one will judge you(:

nhZb43pIaa	I know they are a bit expensive $1,000 +  I don't know anyone who has one. Best bet would be to go to their website and read the reviews, etc.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Tried a few yeah. If you're in the right mood for it, they're totally rockin'!     If you're not though, then it pales in comparison to actual sex.     If the idea of it appeals to you, and you've already used a vibrator/dildo before, chances are you're gonna like them.    Just to be clear, I have no idea what the brands are for the ones I've experienced. So no advice as far as that. I'd say if they seem too cheap though, then go for something better. This'd be one area where I'd be pretty afraid of some sorta error...just in case haha =o)    When I buy anything pricey or that I'd have trouble returning if it sucked, I tend to look for reviews, see if maybe there's a site that'll have reviews for some of these machines. I know a lot of sex toy shops online have reviews, maybe you'll find one for one of these! Hope this helps =o)
H55nCLqPaa	Yeah this probably the most annoying thing about feminists, they refuse to see this fundamental truth.

Sorry. I'm also sorry I can't control what other women find attractive. That's just not how it works!    If you have to keep pretending to be different in a relationship then it's stupid. What happens when you can't keep the cover any longer? This would only work on very short-term and unfulfilling relationships.    Anyway, most people who pretend do not disguise a supportive or nice nature, they disguise a mean and cruel nature which the woman eventually finds out.

Some of the strongest people in the world may have a lack of confidence or may find themselves being vicious critics on themselves.

pzLDXL6gaa	I think you might need some help.    At some point, complaining on answers is no longer enough, and you need professional therapy.    Harriet|`|cWxwHMQWaa	Wouldn't it be more enjoyable, and where I *thought* you were headed till you shocked me haha, to get women into GROUP activities *with* you?    Isn't that more enjoyable than watching her get off a homeless guy?    If you want to just see how far you can push her, women and men both enjoy this, on both sides. The average woman isn't going to go for it, just fair warning.     Here's a test a lot of guys I know use, because it's perfectly safe it's just awkward, for some humiliating and for others just disgusting. Physically, it's 100% safe though. Get her to pee in a cup and then pour it on herself.     If she'll do this, you're pretty guaranteed you can get her to do a bit of what you're talking about.    If she won't do it to please you, chances are...you won't be talking her into anything.    These are successful men and women when it comes to attracting and pleasing partners, they're good people (I wouldn't be friends with them if they weren't) they don't do anything wrong in my eyes to the people they're messing with. Like I've said before, you can coax people and lead them to consider new things or give them some temptation and permission to enjoy things they've wanted to do, but you'll never (short of being a complete psycho and brainwashing them) get people to do things that disgust them. Doesn't happen.     Have fun haha =o)|`|DxohE884aa	I agree with Puppy.

I never felt shy because everyone felt the same as me.|`|m1oaS5Xpaa	just BE the un-shy. you have to feeeeeeeeeeeel it.|`|ToILKl6waa	The best way requires a great amount of courage and willpower. You must break out of your comfort zone and say something you don't normally say. No matter what people think of you, how you feel, or how much confidence is inhabited in your mind, find excuses to talk more than you usually do. Practice with strangers. Ask the cashier how he is, compliment the person behind you on the lunch line, greet the man walking his dog down the street - talk to as many strangers as you can until you feel considerably comfortable.     You are in control always. If you act confident, you will FEEL confident. Also, I advise you to wear clothing that fits your personality and express yourself through your hobbies/things you like to do. After you come out of your shell the first few times, you're bound to break out of the shyness. The more you try, the more you'll improve. Don't let anyone dictate your behavior - you live in a free generation. It's all up to you.     Best of luck.|`|QKU2vYoEaa	Best thing I can think of is just trying to be less shy. You know, talk a little more, get involved in conversations, be appropriate until you're comfortable with the people you're talking to. That sort of thing.    There's no real definite way. Just make sure you catch yourself when you realize you're being shy, and try and reverse it.

029366e443f706114f76140b91711233aa	One day a while back, a man, his heart  heavy with grief, was walking in the woods.  As he thought about his life this day, he knew many things were not right.  He thought about  those who had lied about him back when he had a job.     His thoughts turned to those who had  stolen his things and cheated him.  He remembered family that had passed  on.  His mind turned to the illness he had, that no one could cure.  His very soul was filled with anger, resentment, and frustration.     Standing there this day, searching for answers  he could not find, knowing all else had failed him, he knelt at the base of an old oak tree to seek the one he knew would always be there.  And with tears in his eyes, he prayed:     'Lord- You have done wonderful things for me in this life.  You have told me to do many things for  you, and I happily obeyed. Today, you have told me to forgive. I am sad,  Lord, because I cannot, I don't know how.  It is not fair Lord, I  didn't deserve these wrongs that were done against me and I shouldn't have  to forgive.  As perfect as your way is Lord, this one thing I cannot  do, for I don't know how to forgive.  My anger is so deep Lord, I fear  I may not hear you, but I pray you teach me to do the one thing I cannot  do:  Teach me to forgive .'    As he knelt there in the quiet shade of that old oak tree, he felt something fall onto his shoulder.  He opened his eyes.  Out of the corner of one eye, he saw something red  on his shirt.  He could not turn to see what it was because where the  oak tree had been was a large square piece of wood in the ground.  He raised his head and saw two feet held to the wood with a large spike through them.     He raised his head more, and tears came to his eyes as he saw Jesus hanging on a cross. He saw spikes in His hands,  a gash in His side, a torn and battered body, deep thorns sunk into His head.  Finally he saw the suffering and pain on His precious face. As  their eyes met, the man's tears turned to sobbing, and Jesus began to speak.     'Have you ever told a  lie?'  He asked?     The man answered - 'Yes,  Lord.'     'Have you ever been given too much  change and kept it?'     The man answered - 'Yes.  Lord.'  And the man sobbed more and more.     'Have you ever taken something from work that wasn't yours?' Jesus asked?     And the man answered, 'Yes,  Lord.'     'Have you ever sworn, using my Father's name in vain?'     The man, crying now, answered - 'Yes, Lord.'     As Jesus asked many more times,  'Have you ever'?  The man's crying became uncontrollable, for he could only answer - 'Yes, Lord'.     Then Jesus turned His head from one side to the other, and the man felt something fall on his other shoulder He looked and saw that it was the blood of Jesus. When he looked back up, his  eyes met those of Jesus, and there was a look of love the man had never  seen or known before.     Jesus said, 'I didn't deserve this  either, but I forgive you.'     It may be hard to see how you're going  to get through something, but when you look back in life, you realize how  true this statement is.     Read the following first line slowly and let it sink in.     If God brings you to it - He will bring  you through it.     When Jesus died on the cross, he was thinking of you!|`|AA10546011	Join another prayer group and avoid the mean person as much as you can.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Love them, anyway.
