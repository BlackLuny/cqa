20090226162318AAlTfqZ	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Why do some people "Thumb Bomb" on Y!A?	Ever notice that some categories - every Answer is riddled with thumbs up/down votes - and in some categories, no one does it?      In one category I frequent - there norm is no thumb votes but dare anyone vote either way - then the next time you look at the question - there are tons of votes either way.      Do you think people "gang up" to thumb bomb?  Or does one person break the ice and everyone just follows suit?      Personally - I try to only give Thumbs Up votes, and just don't do anything unless if the answer doesn't warrant a thumbs up - but I think i am in the minority in doing that.

20090226182919AAA6mR8	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Groups	My aim group chat is not working?	So last night, I started a group chat on aim with two other friends.  We had a great time for the next three hours talking about nothing but randomness.  I was the one that started the group and invited the two friends.  So suddenly, when I would send a message, it would say cand send message while pending or something, and would not take my aim.  I aimed them personally (that still worked) and that was fine and both of then said the group chat was not working either.  They started a group and both of them got in but I never even got an invite, they asked if I did but I did not.  since it was no big deal, I uninstalled aim and reinstalled it and tried to create a group again but like when it first disconnected, it would time out saying "starting buddy chat" in the upper left corner.  Can anyone help me out on how I can fix this or to possibly check on what the problem might be?  Thanks.
