The treasonous liberal media hates Bush so much that they refuse to tell the truth. 7 of my cousins have been in Iraq as members of the U.S. military in the last 5 years.

Lbulud8raa	The US was mainly concerned about installing a friendly government in Iraq, amongst other aims.  GWB personally had a beef with Saddam because "he tried to kill my daddy", which is one serious misuse of powers: sacrificing others just to resolve an embarrassing situation for the Bush family.    The aims of the friendly government were to ensure energy supplies and hopefully grant some stability to the area.  The first of these was selfish (especially as only the US benefited) and the second was naive.  There was also an opportunity, grabbed at by prominent Republicans, to profit greatly from rebuilding Iraq.  The GWB administration hoped that the successful installation of a democratic government would lead to fewer charges of setting up a puppet state and, naively again, that there would be a popular groundswell amongst Iraqi's in support of "Stars and Stripes" style democracy.    They forgot the following:    Iraqi is a fractious nation.    The culture is significantly different and people therefore do not universally yearn or desire US style government QED.    The behaviour of the US troops is what the average Iraqi sees: well armed, curt and bossy bully boy invaders (from their perspective) who hold themselves aloof and see every Iraqi as the enemy.  Many have seen family members die, and for whatever reasin, the US is held responsible: hence Mr shoe thrower.  Honestly, I can see why this stature was created and why many support it, and I find it rather politically motivated that it was ordered to be removed.    So it served a political agenda!  And putting up the Stars and Stripes after Baghdad fell did not?      Democracy in Iraq?  Ha, not anytime soon, and not through American means!|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	democracy?  the south is controlled by warlords, the north by the kurds, and in the middle is a dictatorship of the majority (shia)|`|a6fUSU2Paa	What does the removal of a shoe statue have to do with democracy?

iXmEkyj6aa	I will say in a layman's language of all the events.There is no genocide by anyone,we have to understand that.    In Sri Lanka,there are two communities-minority tamils and Singhalas.   Tamils alleged during the eighties that they were subjected to severe discrimination by the remainining Lankans.  Initially they got help from India for protesting and all.  One faction called LTTE broke away from the  struggle and soon became very powerful. There were armed conflicts between the Lankan army and the LTTE and civilians died because of the crossfires.  Soon the LTTE captured northern part of Lanka.  Then the Indian forces came to Lanka for peacekeeping and captured the Northern parts but at a huge cost. This happened during the earlier part of the 1990's.  Soon LTTE started antagonistic activities against India and ended up killing a former Indian PM,Rajiv Gandhi. At that time both Indians and Sri Lankans wanted the Indian forces to move away from Lanka.    Indian Forces moved away at the request of Lanka.  The LTTE again became more powerful and have been resisting since then.  After nearly fifteen years the Lankan army is nearing Victory now.  There is no genocide,people in Jaffna are caught in the cross fires and they have to flee. There is some sympathy for the Lankan Tamils in South India ,nearly half of the Sri Lankan Tamils are now living as refugees in South India .    EDIT:  See except the Civilians,everyone are antagonists here-the Indian army,LTTE,Lankan army.  Of course,both LTTE and Lankan army are antagonists-there is no need to explain.  The Indians provided the initial Torque to the rebel factions,just like the Americans who fueled the Jihadis in Afghan and are now bearing the brunt of it. At least India now supports the Lankan army and also the civilian Tamils,but does not interfere in anyone's affairs.   Why did the Indian's  fuel the Lankan protests initially?-most Indians are ashamed of that in fact.  If we research on it,we will know that Indians were doing a tit-for-tat because history tells us that Lanka supported Pakistan's  Genocide in Bangladesh.  This seems to be a garbage justification but will haunt Indians forever.|`|mqW8sf2taa	Bella - you are a typical example of an ignorant air head living abroad with no idea at all about what is going in Sri Lanka. Firstly have you EVER been to Lanka? If you have, it must have been when you were like 2 since you dont seem to know anything about the reality.  Just because some Tamils abroad decide to go on a rally and scream and rant it doesnt make it true.   I invite you to come to Sri Lanka and see for your self if a genocide is going on. The only genocide going on, if any, is done by the LTTE who employ suicide bombers to kill innocent civillians in public places & places of religion.  Please dont talk about things that you dont know.|`|a6fUSU2Paa	There's a conflict between the Sri Lankan Government and the Tamil Tigers rebel group. I wouldn't say there's a genocide because neither side is targeting civilians, but there are a lot of people caught in the crossfire.|`|yZ1VioWvaa	.....?...|`|whYdgOMZaa	First of all there is NO genocide in Sri Lanka.    There is a civil war going on between the SLA (Sri Lankan Army) and the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of the Tamil Eelam), who fights for a separate country.    A lot of civilians (official figures are somewhere in 40,000 - but I think actual numbers are higher) has been killed by the 30 year old conflict.    There was a attack on Tamil population by mobs in 1983 in which about 2000 Tamils were killed. Then there were repeated attacks on Sinhalese and Muslim population living within the so-called Tamil Eelam territory by LTTE in an attempt of ethnic cleansing. And there were numerous civilian casualties who were caught in the cross fire between SLA and LTTE.    But these events are nothing like a genocide. It is a civil war.

He is perceived as an Ulema and is currently Kelantans PAS commissioner and the Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) of the state.    He pursued his study majoring in Shari'ah (Islamic Law) at Egyptian Al-Azhar University. During the time of his study, he is one of the witnesses and a civilian to lived in the heat of Arab-Israeli Wars.    He survived his administration even under intense pressure politically and economically by the former Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir, who clashed frequently on the role Islam should or should not play in state- and national-level politics in multi-ethnic and multi-religious Malaysia.    He has a son, Nik Adli Nik Aziz who is detained under the Malaysian Internal Security Act (ISA), which is an act that lock the accused (mostly opposition party members) up without any trial, for smuggling illegal immigrants into Malaysia. Nik Adli also has been accused of colllusion with Thai Muslim separatists and terrorists, reportedly having been active in the procurement and movement of weapons and explosives across the Malaysia-Thailand border. To date, there's still no evidence found on any of these accusations and Nik Adli is still imprisoned.    He is generally respected as a positive and well-meaning political leader, but has drawn criticism for his expressed views on the necessity of unequivocal application of Islamic shariah law to all facets and levels of society of Muslims. As much as he is regarded as political opponent, he is also well respected by them even by former Prime Minister Mahathir    Despite his position as the head of the Kelantan State, Tuan Guru lives in his small house and lead a very moderate life instead of using an official government residence. Being a prominent figure of an Islamic party, he is well received and get a lots of supports from Non-Muslims especially those from Kelantan.|`|AA12036288	No.

It's connotation is used to persuade the world that the so called enemy is using unethical and immoral tactics with no value for human life.  This is not the case. All attacks, I stress 'ALL' attacks are from freedom fighters (called Insurgents) who want to dispel the West (infidels) from their land. Namely, Israel, United States, England and the other so called alliance countries that are slaughtering their people.  Ben Laden in the middle nineties declared war against the U.S. after Clinton attempted to bomb his headquarters in Sudan. The declaration was taken too lightly and as a result the twin towers  was bombed once with casualties and then a second time for good measure.  These attacks will continue to occur until the West begins to smarten up. Where exactly they will occur is not certain, but you can bet it will happen in areas where the occupiers are camped.

AA10693819	Mate Hitler would have supplied the PISS for everyone.    Quite a character and not a nasty..as most people make him out to be.|`|AA11906603	No.  Let's hope Hitler's spirit is not still floating around somewhere.  I find this whole business very upsetting, even though I'm an American and barely watch soccer at all.  My husband is much more into it.  I think racism and other kinds of ethnic prejudice should never be tolerated in soccer or any other professional competition. Obviously people will say things to try to upset each other, but prejudice has no place in sports competition.  What kind of a message are we giving to our kids if we just stand by without protesting this?

AA11966875	It depends on who you ask - one style of music will be more popular among a certain age group, a country, a part of a country, at a different time in history.  Are you wondering what music is most listened to?  Has the most radio stations?  Has the most bands presently making that style of music?  Is making the most money?  Appears in the most movies and television shows?  And again - in what country? part of the country?      If you are looking for just a generic answer, I think you still have to notice whom you ask - because their answers may be biased depending on where they're from and what kind of answer they think you are looking for.    Hopefully that answers the "why" part of your question.  :)  As to the "what" - I assume you mean what music is most popular - I'm going to go with what the industry calls, "popular music" ... The most unpopular music then is that stuff that's never played.|`|0feb10052c3b8e545ceeecb06914f116aa	i like rap music

2rdXW293aa	Great question.<br>  <br>  Barack Obama is indeed talking directly to the people with weekly chats at www.change.gov. His talks are direct, forthright, and don't shy away from the tough topics of the day; he confronts them head-on.<br>  <br>  As far as the new age in communications - that was already here. However, Obama is certainly using the Internet in a way it hasn't been used before, and it's brilliant. He's letting all of us know that he's hitting the ground running - pulling the top people together to work with him in Washington, leaning on the Senate to make sure they pass the appropriate measures to keep families and companies solvent.<br>  <br>  You're also correct in that We the People did this. I have never sent money to a political campaign before or worked for a candidate; this election changed all that. Many who had never been involved before jumped at the chance to work for this man and for their country.<br>  <br>  As to what this means: I think other politicians and leaders will see from Obama's use of the Internet what a beautiful medium this is to reach out to constituents - to keep us informed, and conversely, find out what we're thinking.<br>  <br>  Thank heaven we have such a bright guy at the helm!|`|n2eOdOm8aa	Who are you kidding the media put Obama in the White House not the Internet.  Plus the fact that he spent $650 million dollars to get there.  He bought the White House it has nothing to do with the internet.  <br>  <br>  You were and your family were part of the 650 million don't make me laugh.  The ones that were part of that 650 million were rich elites. What a fool you are.|`|Q2YYchzwaa	Only if you mean everyone will get a new big screen TV for every room of the house so Obama and friends can make sure every word coming out of your mouth is politically correct.|`|eROKRkNmaa	You hit the nail on the head.You are so right.|`|9rLi9pSRaa	The new age in communications is here already.  Yes his campaign was brilliant and the money was largely small donations of $5 and $10 dollars from a lot of people who wanted change and believed in him.  Says a lot for the American people who were willing to take the time to send money for his campaign.  He appealed to the young people and kept them up to date with his information.  It only shows what a masterful leader he will make.  He listened to some good advise and followed it.  It has set a standard for elections in the future.

(edit: radha, jammu and kashmir were always india's.  in fact, the only reason this problem is still going on is because instead of directly sending the army and reclaiming the region from the invading pakistan, nehru went to the united nations to ask for a solution, and, without considering the forces of justice, the united nations said to give some of our country to pakistan.  nehru thus made a big mistake by not being decisive and by not keeping our country immune to foreign intervention.  once you feed the dog (pakistan) with some food (the land un gave), it will always want more (the land it is now killing people for through its acts of terrorism.)|`|58db6fbf10b52f0ca94590ed3cba9b17aa	Nope, infact US shuld review its Nuke deal with India that could have very bad impact on the region.|`|a20db4319abc24ccec86cacb10873065aa	no!! that curry recipe is fantastic...did u get a copy??

4c7ca79b729507b166c8ac798252cd14aa	Heh, well that would be difficult because these corporations own our government.  Don't believe me?  Well look for yourself, the federal reserve is run and own by a corporation, that's right ladies and gentlemen, a corporation controls the printing and issuance of money in america, NOT the government.  Look it up yourself.  It's these same corporations that are doing the very things you want them to attack.  These corporations that print our money also funded hitler during world war II.  Do your homework and look it up for yourself, don't believe me.  It makes it more fun for me when you do your own homework and prove me right.  War is only going to happen when it means money for the bankers and corporations.  So this war on terror, you better believe is making someone, somewhere, a huge truckload of money.  Don't believe?  Again, do your own homework.  Osama Bin Laden has been wanted for quite some time and it is documented and proven that he was receiving medical treatment at a hospital on american soil, we KNEW he was there and it was OUR government protecting him...but you don't hear about that in the news reels, do you?  So don't tell me if they KNEW where he was, and WE were protecting him while WE were paying for his medical treatment while he was wanted that this war on terror is real.  I mean yeah, people are strapping bombs to their chest and blowing people up every day and I do NOT agree with that or advocate that in any way shape or form but just be carefull because the same source you are getting this information from is from the same corporations that OWN and influence the media.|`|c0409627d09f8c2f38561958fd52a476aa	Who would pay the bills?|`|1af82f4322fb6009f2617a2dd40da4dcaa	way to go, lets start with the car companies.|`|5ea67a199383712addcd6094e5e5576baa	Because we need to take on the current threats.

UYmRjCY9aa	there is a difference, however Brown came into the role of PM and said British jobs for British people and has completely reneged on that comment. I wonder at him and his so called Britishness, and his loss of marbles, if our workers have the skills, and are more than willing to do the work wherever it happens to be, why are we bringing in foreign labour, at a time of high economic crisis and labour shortages.   This is the third company i have seen who have refused to employ British workers, and i wonder why, and indeed how they can get away with it.|`|eUi7EFCdaa	Protectionism is protecting all jobs for British. Whether people like it or not we need foreign labour and foreign skills. Many do the jobs the British just don't want to do. And there is a shortage of skilled labour here|`|3AZ63fYxaa	The French say that they will never let a industry get into the hands of a foreign Company, because they know that you need control of your means of production, while in this country they say that it does not matter who owns the company, even when that company file for the rights to produce that product, and only they can manufacture the product.................then you have the case where foreign imports are taxed so high that they are priced out of the market, or you ban the import of that product, so that your home made product is given a unfair advantage over the imported goods.......
